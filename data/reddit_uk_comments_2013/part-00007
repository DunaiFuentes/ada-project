true,[deleted],null,null,"Well no not really philistine, there's some interesting motifs in a lot of his films that reference pop culture and things which could be considered ""low brow"" if you want to call it that but then again it's with a distinctly post modernist twist, which has in many respects as a movement reevaluated the dichotomy of high and low brow. He may or may not do this intentionally, but there are things that he does do with intent and that inspires others to question why he does them in his film making practice. As you would do with any artist that mattered.

There's that little point where Uma draws a square directly in the air which is shown on screen, it's telling you to understand that this is chiefly a man made creation and out of the slumber you sometimes get into when you watch a film where you can loose yourself a little bit and the narrative becomes your reality.

Suffice to say though he's making the fucking films, I don't say the man can't get tired of being asked the same questions about the validity of violence but he does include the damn gore, it's his creation, he has some responsibility, regardless of whether it's a stupid connection to say that gore is a direct influence to modern violence and not in fact as it seems to be a reflection of it. And I mean to say that not to condemn his choice to include violence, it's his art, but if he's asked about it then there's only one person to blame. Naturally though taking a facile question like that to someone whose made the damn film is likely to get you a pissed off reaction anyway.",0,1357918729,null,0,false,0,c7v2vjy,t3_16dikb,t1_c7v2vjy,t1_c7v0otq,null,1430927174,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Sahin doesn't play the same position that either of them have played this season. More than half of Allen's appearances have been filling in Lucas' role, which I would never want Sahin to play; and he never really got going as the most attacking midfielder either (though IMO he'd still do it better than Shelvey). His best position is the deep playmaker, but that's Gerrard's now, and rightly so - and Sahin's too good and too expensive to keep on the bench.

It's just unfortunate. But if we pick up a proper #10 in the summer, or Suarez fills that role, then our midfield will look much more balanced going into next season than this season's has turned out to be (all our best midfielders this season are competing for the deeper roles, and we don't have a proper #10 right now)",0,1357922326,null,0,false,0,c7v3ymo,t3_16dtaz,t1_c7v3ymo,t3_16dtaz,null,1430927696,30,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,30

I don't know like, after sinking a considerable amount of cash into travelling around with them home and away. The atmosphere and seeing my team is great and all... but I do pay to see my team win above everything else. that is not negating I love the the team and atmosphere.

You think supporters from Newcastle, Stoke, Liverpool, Arsenal, Man U, Man City Etc, are just happy to see their team. Teams that do shit compared to teams that do well will always have a lower attendance because many fans feel that why watch their team capitulate?

If you come to england and listen to the radio. (actually you can listen to talk sport and fivelive online) you will see every fan on their say positive things when they win, bad things when they lose.

And not being in the UK I have to say, and I know you won't agree, does have a difference. There is nothing you can do about it and it sucks for you. Getting up early in the morning and watching every game you can is all well and good when you have the internet in most places you go and an unrestrictive viewing policy from not being in the UK (I can't watch away games that I can't make on 3 o clock on saturdays due to licensing, so I have to find a shitty stream), and not having to do all the travelling to sing your heart out. You can, most times I'm assuming, watch the game in comfort and then not have 1-5 hours each way of your life consumed.
But being in the stadium, being able to voice your displeasure is a heat of the moment thing and it's a cauldron of emotion that you will never get anywhere but in the stadium.

Sahin is arguably/potentially world class (as much as that term is bandied around). As BR says, there is always a place for world class players because they'll make a difference wherever they play.

I don't understand the reluctance to push Gerrard forward to accommodate Lucas and Sahin but then I'm not the manager of Liverpool. Allen is clearly a key player for our system and BR's pet so maybe it's a long term decision to use Allen over Sahin even through struggling form but I feel sick that Shelvey gets in the team before him.

There are two main potential benefits to higher wages for Members of Parliament that are regularly quoted: Prevention of corruption through bribes or provision of services and the drive for better quality public servants. I have no quibble with the first necessarily. The second is not evidence based and perhaps not desirable. Higher wages do not guarantee higher performance. I cite the performance of various chiefs of the financial services as examples of exceptionally high pay and poor performance. Likewise, chiefs of the rail industry have performed particularly poorly in that sector.

It's not because there is inefficiently to be dealt with that the whole project doesn't make any sence or is not beneficial. 

If the UK leaves the EU 1/10th of the jobs in the country will be treatened (ironically those that scream the hardest with the most unnaunced opinion that Britain should leave the EU have exactly the kind of jobs that will probably be treathened).

I have been 'ill' since I was 15 (now 25) so have seen pretty much everything the NHS has to offer. It started with passing out and feeling really tired. It took eight years to get an actual diagnosis but during that entire time I had appointments every three months to check up on how I was doing, while there was no forward progress on a diagnosis there was always forward progress on trying to find out what I could have. Eventually after what seemed an eternity I was diagnosed within five minutes by like one of the worlds experts on the condition I have. 

I was found to have a condition called POTS which gives me a really high resting heart rate (sitting here writing this it is 160 bpm) and if I now stand up it will jump to 180-200 and if I do anything energetic it will stay in the 200+. (these are the numbers when I am on my medication)

It took 8 years for me to get a diagnosis but that was purely down to the rarity of my condition. I was never fobbed off during any of that time. When I went to the emergency room, with an emergency, I was seen right away. When I went with something slightly less important I had to wait... because of the emergencies. I must have seen a good 20 odd specialists during that time from ear to brain to heart specialists. I had an operation with a machine that went Ping to explore my hear and even had a couple of MRIs. Since it is a life long problem the medication, which treats the symptoms, I take I even get for free. 

I can only imagine how screwed I would be if it had not been for the NHS and if I had to pay for everything. Due to everything still going on my career prospects are not exactly brilliant and just the cost of one MRI would be about as much as I can earn in three months.

The implications of time travel affecting one's own timeline is just a theme Moffat likes to play with in general. Other examples of that are the Doctor and River 'meeting in the wrong order' and the Pandorica arc.

Sometime after the end of Season 5, the Doctor receives an anymous blue envelope and follows its instructions, leading to the diner scene and everything after that. The rest of the season is the doctor discovering the time of his own death, finding out that it is River (AKA Melody Pond) who kills him because of the Silence's machinations and coming to peace with that.

There is a difference between the cultures of American and British fandom, as there are cultural differences between Americans and the British in general. the British do not agree with the get behind your team at all costs, it's just not the same. We all still very much love our team and club.

You're never going to do anything but upset British fans when trying to tell them to support their teams in a different way. Football is regarded as a holy cow, there are many traditions associated with the fans who go to grounds week in week out, little unwritten rules that maybe go against usual cultural protocol. Football was of course the great sport of the working classes and as well as a pie and a pint before the game with your mates there are many idiosyncratic behaviours around supporting football in Britain that are hard to explain, unless you've been here and grown up/spent a long time around it.

Booing players and or the team is not taken in the same way it might be in America, it is a voice of protest, but if you go to a match in Britain players, coaches and match officials will be regularly boo'ed throughout the match. it's just part of what we do.

Booing a team rarely happens unless they have been awful for a long period of time and even then it is usually a minority that take part. 

The media quite often misrepresent who or what was boo'ed as well for their sensationalised headlines. Don't take all the Chelsea fans boo Rafa off the pitch to heart, it's quite often a vocal minority showing their frustration and it is very rarely aimed at the entire team. The players and staff know this because they play amongst that culture, week in and week out, if you react on the pitch to the crowd (what we all secretly want to happen) you're dead, finished you'll have the entire stadium on your back for the rest of the match, but I digress.

true,courters,flare-brum,Occupy: Shoreditch,"Look, we may not be London, but £30 a head (including drinks, I am assuming) is going to be tricky. That said here are my suggestions, and why:

* [Cote](http://www.cote-restaurants.co.uk/Cote_Birmingham.html) is surprisingly lovely with gorgeous food and service for the price. The ambiance is romantic without being stuffy and the location is fantastic with the canals and a few nicer bars to pop into for a pre-dinner cocktail or after-champers.

* Chez Jules, which is now [Le Truc](http://letruc.co.uk/), was FANTASTIC when we went. It was definitely, in my opinion, a hidden surprise. I cannot speak to it now that it has moved, but I'd hope the food is just as good. Can't really say about how it looks inside, but I hope better than when it was on Ethel St, which wasn't much to write home for.

* [JuJus](http://www.jujuscafe.co.uk/) has always been really nice! It's a bit of a dick to get to if neither of you are too familiar with the city, but it's really quite worth it.

* [Lasan](http://www.lasan.co.uk/) is gorgeous, too. It's true the best Indian is definitely the hole in the wall sort, but Lasan is truly great and is a lovely date night spot.

Not knowing kind of what vibe you want, I'd also maybe suggest Bodega. I love the cocktails and my boyfriend and I would go there a lot. We did Valentine's at Edmund's, which might be a bit out of your price range, but if you want to wine and dine, but not quite hit Turners, Simpson's, or Purnell's price, Edmund's is the way to go. Really depends on how romantic you want to go and/or if there is a specific location you're looking for. 

Have a safe trip over here and a really wonderful time! If it isn't your first time, do yourself a favour and find Get Stuffed on Broad Street. Have one for me, a fellow American. I crave them.

And while drilling and generation companies are making an effort to be more green and exploring new technologies, none of them wants to take the first step without huge government subsidisation because there's too much risk involved.

true,MrBushido2318,eu,European Union,"I guess i'll start with a tl;dr. The internet is [going to be] equally important as water in terms of quality of life in the near future. You will not be able to live without it. Why weren't the water services privatized in the 80s? Because it would not be profitable to run them well. For the same reasoning, you cannot expect a private company to provide a good telecom service to the entire of the UK.

And the longer version!

I think the telecom situation would certainly be better, but I think the decision to privatize telecoms was right at the time. In the 80s telephones were a relative luxury, life without a phone would be extremely inconvenient but it had no real impact on a persons quality of life. So in that sense, I think it wasn't a bad idea to privatize the industry. 

The problem as we all now know, is the massive change in focus the telecom industry has taken, especially over the past 5 years. Companies are cutting costs by providing services online, be bandwidth light things like reading bills online, online banking, to bandwidth intense things like downloading high definition videos, music, and games. It's apparent in the not to distant future, access to the internet will be a basic human right.

Now lets take a moment to look at the telecom industry as a private company. How do you maximize profits? Well a business 101 perspective is to provide a desirable service to as many people as possible at the lowest cost possible. In terms of telecom this is essentially biased towards places of high population density. It takes a lot less money and effort to provide high speed connections to central london (or manchester/liverpool/etc) than it does to a town in the country side. A great example is the fact that countries like korea and japan with insane population densities have the highest net speeds in the world. The problem in the UK is that we don't all live in 20 story apartment blocks on a postage stamp of land. 

It simply isn't profitable for telecom companies to provide high speed net to everybody and towns like my own, with a population of around 60k but an hours drive from the nearest motorway get completely neglected (the best I can get is 3mb out of an ""up to 8mb"" connection). Especially when the entire infrastructure is owned by BT. There's no company to compete for the market in rural areas, because the only telecom company that makes enough money to lay down new cabling in an entire town/city is BT.

Thankfully, the government intervenes. I should be able to get BT infinity by the end of the quarter because of the massive amounts of cash BT ([as in billions](http://www.publictechnology.net/sector/ngos/bt-give-us-2bn-and-well-deliver-universal-superfast-broadband)) have been given by the government to improve our network infrastructure. The problem here, to my knowledge, is this money is just given away because of the necessity of the improvement. It's not a loan. Yet BT still turns a ""profit"" and that money hemorrhages to investors not the public that is paying for it.

So in direct answer to your question I think the current system is almost right. BT has to provide access to its exchanges and infrastructure to 3rd party companies. If I could magic wand one thing though, it is that I'd make BT disappear and have a publicly run entity in its place. We're giving BT tax money so turn a profit, and that just doesn't sit right with me. The government should be paying engineers to create its own network, not pissing it away on the retirement fund of thatchers government.",0,1357933549,null,0,false,0,c7v76wr,t3_16c5yh,t1_c7v76wr,t1_c7v4sgw,null,1430929214,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Just on the subject of Irish democracy, Anthony Arblaster wrote a very interesting bit in a book of his on democracy where he described the paradox that exists in Northern Ireland. In modern media and politics, democracy is very much a term associated with civil freedoms, liberation, peace and prosperity etc. Democracy = Freedom and vice versa. The troubles largely started/escalated (there are other reasons obviously, but in general terms) because the Catholics were treated so badly and had no way to defend themselves because they were a minority and in democracy, the majority always wins. So during the troubles, the Protestant factions had the upper hand because they could call for a return to freedom and democracy and look like peace seekers, when a return to democracy would actually mean a return to Protestant dominance. Northern Ireland suffered greatly from a political system which is supposed to guarantee freedom to the people, but if it is used in a country which is so diametrically divided in to a minority and a majority who don't share much common ground (or don't want to share much common ground), it undermines itself and civil violence is practically inevitable. Democracy is often used as a synonym for freedom, but in some cases, it is quite the opposite.

As an example: While I was doing officer cadet development we had to send away an entire sydicate because they got cloning as their sciency topic, and as they were all non-STEM uni students none of them knew what they were on about. Listened to them chatting utter bullshit for 15 mins before ending it. Not a single thing they said was even factually correct. (My uni background was in genetics. It was painful). We tried giving them a few other topics from the backup list, (NICE medicine choices, ethics of animal/ human testing etc) and still no luck. The STEM topics are never obsecure or requiring of in depth knowledge, but they do require you to at least of had a look over the basics.

Yup, I'm not sure about going full regular, but long term my commitment to the TA is dependant of FR2020. I'm still able to use my Main Board pass to go for the regular course at the moment if everything in life goes tits up.

TA get about 6hrs under the academics and some extra reading. For the TA Sandhurst is just a solid 3 week assessment after 12~18 months of external training. There isn't much spare time. We focused on the history of the manoeverist approach and the North African campain in WW2. Post-commissioning training had more academic stuff but that was self directed.

---

As a male you need to score a 10.2 on the bleep test, do 44 press ups in 2 mins and 50 sit ups in a seperate 2 mins. At selection you just meet the standard and stop and at Sandhurst you keep going til you drop (the bleep test is replaced by a timed 1.5 mile run at Sandhurst, but that's easier). Females only have to hit 8.2 on the bleep and 22 press ups. Sit ups are the same. A lot of the girls will aim to beat the male standard anyway.

At Sandhurst you also have to do 8 miles with 20(?)kg of kit on in 2hrs as a formed group.

There's also a mini obstacle course on selection, and all your field exercises at Sandhurst. So long as you prove you have enough stamina to keep up with the pace you're fine, but if you're visably unable to keep up and slow others down you can be dropped for that.

---

The maximum age to start Sandhurst as a regular is 25 now, so a few scrape it in there. For TA there's a split. Half are early 20s, and the other half are 25 to about 32.

Some older candidates are getting in via conversion board. To do that you first get a TA commission, then do 2 tours in realtively quick succession, then apply to transfer to the regulars (so long as there is a space you can fill). That works at the Lt/ Capt level.

---

Nothing extra to prove for the regulars, for the TA outside of officer selection the fitness standards gradually dip as you get older to take into account aging joints etc. This dip is ignored for officer training forcing older candidates to train to a harder-to-achieve standard and risk a higher chance of injury.

---

At selection you aren't allowed to continue beyond the standard. They stop you once you reach it. For Sandhurst (regular or TA) it's easier the fitter you are. Depends what future you're looking at really. Specialist trade soldiers are less likely to care/ be impressed that you beat them during PT as long as you hit the standard. The Infantry will expect the officer in the top 5-10% fitness-wise. Fitness is the one thing that you can completely control before you go though, so it's always worth getting as much in as you can.

More importantly, he has solid technique and a wide range of link up skills, coupled with pace to burn and a rapid explosive initial step off the first touch. Versatile enough to play on the wing, but that's not where I would put him, he's much better used up front as a striker or shadow striker, making runs behind the defense or playing off the shoulder of the last man and beat the offside trap with his pace. Again, if he bulked up a bit he could also add some aerial qualities (heading and hold-up play) to his game.

true,jonpv,null,null,"Going to give you some free advice. I'm not a writer, but I think ""passion in writing"" doesn't make sense and it should be ""passion for writing"".

Forgetting about that, you start off saying you have a BA in Media. Media is an incredibly broad term. How about saying something like ""I learnt skills X, Y and Z while studying for my BA in Media"".

The rest of your post reads as a shopping list of things you would like from your employer: the opportunity to do some networking, an education on how the marketing industry works, an education on how to do your job, an education on SEO, and job security. But you have only mentioned one thing that you can do for an employer (writing). Sure they can PM you to find out more, but you haven't really given them enough reason to yet.

Then you put in the killer phrase ""if you like me"". I'm now immediately wondering why you said that. You must have said it because there would be reasons I wouldn't like you, because otherwise you wouldn't have mentioned it at all. I immediately start thinking of reality TV show contestants who talk about how they are ""not here to make friends"" and how ""some people like me and some people don't, that's just how I am"" but in reality they are terrible drama queens/kings and very disruptive and cause problems.

""hard work, high attention to detail and a strong desire to excel"" are required by literally every job ever and are not so much good points as just things an employer would take for granted. Aside from the fact that you're a writer but ""high attention to detail"" doesn't make logical sense, it would be much better if you just listed some great examples of things you have done. But also remembering that employers don't care what you did in the past unless it's evidence for things that you can do in the future.

It's those kinds of generic phrases that people tend to skip when reading covering letters, because they just want to know if you can do X, Y or Z or at least see some evidence that you could learn how to do X, Y or Z really quickly because you did something similar to X, Y or Z in the past or have many of the skills that are required to do X, Y or Z well.",0,1357939428,null,0,false,0,c7v98mm,t3_16cmkm,t1_c7v98mm,t3_16cmkm,null,1430930181,2,false,london_forhire,t5_2sdbo,2

Everyone can make a mistake, sometimes there are harsher consequences than others but unfortunately that is part of life...you can't save everyone as you aren't magic men. Anyway, back on point. You went to A+E with a EMERGENCY which is why you were seen and treated so quickly. Those who moan about having to wait hours are the ones who have gone in with a hurt finger or cut on their arm which is highly unlikely to kill them and therefore they can wait their turn (although the sort of people who go to a+e with a hurty finger or cut arm are the ones who will moan to EVERYONE THEY KNOW about how they had to wait 4+ hours to see anyone AND THEN they were only given a plaster! THE HORROR!). I approve of the fact that you called NHS direct first to seek their advice as to whether it warranted a trip to the hospital as I know myself that I would be worried going to hospital and thinking I was wasting their time! Being wheeled to x-ray by a doctor, however, surprises me! They must've either been a med student or the best doctor in the world because doctors just don't do that! Most of them seem to find it too below them to even touch a patient (at least from my experience). 

Overall, I am biased but I do feel that the NHS is an AMAZING service and recently on my practice experience I have seen this first hand. I'm working on a neuro-rehab ward witnessing people recovering from strokes, hemorrhages, paralysis, tumours all sorts and the care they receive is worth probably upwards of £1000 a day per patient (19 bed ward) and I doubt there is a single patient in there that could afford that sort of care out of pocket!

My new instructor, rather than take me down the same old roads all the time, would take me a random route each time, different conditions, times of day etc. I think this helped me to drive more naturally and also become more confident.

Well, I can only relate my experience. I was referred by my GP to the Dermatology Dept. at my local hospital due to a small growth on my temple, which she (and I, tbh) thought could have been some form of skin cancer.


I was seen by the Dr. there who confirmed that it was [Basal cell carcinoma](http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertypes/Skin/Aboutskincancer/Typesofskincancer.aspx#DynamicJumpMenuManager_6_Anchor_1) and said that she would deal with it shortly. After about a 20 minute wait in the corridor, I was taken into the treatment room, given a local anaesthetic, and the growth was surgically removed.


My appointment was for 11am, by 12:30 I was on my way home, sorted. How's that for service?

There is no directly comparable job to being an MP.  The only yardstick is previous year's salaries.

All our faces are basically the same, then we have slight tweaks that make us look different.  If you look at pictures of human skulls, you'll see they are all much more similar than our faces.

Once you have the basic shape of the skull down, with the eyes and nose and all that in the right places, tweak it to look like Tennant.  High cheekbones, narrow face, slim, raised eyebrow.

Finally, the hair.  This can be the most daunting part because hair is so detailed, but don't let that fool you.  Face structure will get you most of the way towards looking like your model (Tennant, in this case)  To do realistic hair, think of the hair as a single mass.  Put some clay on his bald head and ""style"" it by brushing the clay in the direction you would if you were combing his hair.  Don't sculpt the individual little stringy-hairs one at a time.  They end up looking like spikes.  [This is a good picture of his hair alone](http://i.imgur.com/IpEWc.jpg).  Use this and other pictures.  Use tons of pictures.  Other posters have suggested /r/davidtennant and it really does have tons of pictures to use.  

Good luck!

EDIT:  One more thing, don't try and do a finished piece on your first attempt.  Do lots of little studies first.  Photograph the study, smush the clay up and try again.

So, I called the after-care dental team who were really incompetent, I spoke to the dental co-ordinator who ignored the fact I could barely open my mouth to eat, had a temperature and didn't feel right. He told me to just keep up with my salt water rinses, take pain relief (which I told him wasn't helping) and to call back in 48 hrs if it hadn't improved. I decided that evening to call our local out of hours doctors to get a second opinion who told me to just keep taking pain relief and that there was nothing they could do.

Fast forward to Thursday and another phone call to the out of hours doctors I'd had enough and decided to call NHS Direct. They informed me after some questioning that the best thing for me to do was get down to A&amp;E asap as I was showing signs of having an infection and they thought it was best I get checked out. I felt ridiculous going to the accident and emergency department just for what could have been solved over the phone with a dentist but I got a friend to take me there.

This is where the A&amp;E went above and beyond what I expected; I was seen within 25 minutes by the triage nurse, who informed me they wanted to take x-rays to make sure the infection hadn't spread, which I got within 15 minutes of seeing him. One hour later I was home with the antibiotics I had so desperately needed since Tuesday. I honestly thought I was going to get turned away as in my eyes it wasn't an emergency.

TL;DR - Incompetence of one dental co-ordinator ended up in a trip to A&amp;E where I was seen and home within 2 hours. The NHS does have it's downfalls, but I am so grateful for it.",0,1357942054,null,0,false,0,c7va3kp,t3_16dkd8,t1_c7va3kp,t3_16dkd8,null,1430930801,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Sure the stomach bug might justify Swansea, but what about QPR away (and QPR at home for that matter), Norwich away, etc. Its a rather unfortunate common theme. The only time he ever really seems up for it is big matches, like Arsenal and United.

EDIT: While this would never happen, because I think at this point he, himself doesn't believe he can get back to form worthy of his payrate, he could easily endear himself to Chelsea supporters by restructuring his deal.

Fair enough, but it's a choice not a requirement. 

&gt;I have to pay shit loads for rent for a comparatively shit house because the landlords know they have students bent over with no choice.
You are doing it wrong then. Sharing should be massively cheaper than having your own place, even to get somewhere half decent. 

&gt;I have sports team expenses, univeristy books, university other things (stationary etc), also food, also utilities, also travel card, and my bike and gym membership.
Gym membership? Sports team? Both are hobbies. 

&gt;There is NO logic where a student has more money than a professional unless a profesinal is frivolous with their money.
There are plenty. I was a student not that long ago, so can speak from experience. 

&gt;No place that pays well here will employ student, and due to the demand even if you find a place there is 10 people per 1 job oppurtunity. 
Well you know those massive long holidays you get - use them. Or use your car to get somewhere that does have work. Or sit on your arse feeling hard done to. Your choice. 

&gt;Students don't ALL drink 5 nights a week, nor do we all go travelling for months at a time, those are only the priveldged few who have parents payrolling them, or just a general misconception. Of those I know who do go on holiday stay at super cheap hostels etc, whereas professionals go to hotels.\
Not all professionals go on holidays either. Both are misconceptions, there are well off people and poor people in both camps. 

&gt; How on earth does full time childcare cost 25k? Do you know what school is called? And the fact that work hours school hours pretty much match up?
It doesn't cost 25k, nursery costs are about £1000 per month, depending on the age of the child. Take home pay on a salary of 25k is about £1400 per month (tax is a bitch). Add £100 for travel costs and another £100 for incidental costs (lunches, office clothes, etc) and there is very little advantage to the second parent working until the children are all at school age. Add another child under 5 and you can double those costs btw.

Best places too visit in this shite hole would be the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, As its an old Victorian houses and streets as well as the transport museum which has the Delorean, which was built here as well as locomotive trains, If you are into that type of thing.  You could also look at the Omagh Folk park, its a similar place, with old Folk houses that people lived in before they immagrated to shitey Canada.  

I would reccomend the Victoria Centre for Shopping as well as the City Centre.   
Laveries is a good bar, with a nightclub but the Mclub can be often rough, I'm always getting into fights at that club.  You could also go to the Odessy as the Beach and Box is a good nightclub, However, it is quite a young spot.  Also, you'll probably get alot of ""Your ma"" jokes here.

Even if it was just unrequited feelings(Such as with Martha).

Moffat seems to have taken Doctor Who closer back to the asexual alien he was in the classic series, but still left a little bit of romantic undertone, which I'm actually perfectly fine with. For me, the whole Doctor/Rose thing was just...off, and I wasn't really a fan. I didn't like seeing The Doctor pine after someone romantically, especially as strongly as he did, or see other people so strongly pine after The Doctor.

But anyway, I find your answer/argument there is absolutely terrible, because that same argument you give is actually *against* circumcision, as I already mentioned: As many people see cutting off toes wrong as they do with circumcision when there are no other factors influencing the judgement, such as religious, etc.

That is why you can go through a list of parts to chop off babies and people will say: no, no, no, no, no, no, and then you get to ""how about the foreskin?"" and suddenly a bunch of people will say ""weellll I guess that is acceptable"" - those people are all actually against it. It is the only conclusion that makes any sense. If you are against cutting off hundreds of other less vital parts of a baby's body, there is no sensical reason to be for a specific one, the reason is simply that people are not being rational about it.

You should have a long hard think about why people are accepting of this one specific thing when they would find any of the other acts utterly disgusting and reprehensible.

See that doesn't make sense does it? If this was really just an almost meaningless act, not worthy of any special attention or protection, then all those other things would be too. That they aren't is proof of how irrational people are being over this single issue.

And it all stems from the status quo - it's accepted because it currently happens on a large scale. But the real opinion is that it isn't allowed.

As I already mentioned, circumcision is *already* illegal in some ways in almost every country where it is carried out, but it is something that is never challenged or brought up, because of protections of religious practises, outcries of persecution, etc.

So sure, it is ""accepted"" by people, but that doesn't mean people think it is right, or should be allowed... and that is the real issue here, isn't it?

The reason there isn't more outcry is simply that same apathy that you have, because most people do not seem to have the clarity of thought to realise exactly what it is that they are accepting... they just accept the concept or the idea, but almost none accept the harm it does and are only okay with it as long as they don't properly comprehend that harm.

That is why if you ask someone specifically about causing various physical and psychological harms, they will be vehemently against it. Yet if you ask about circumcision, something that causes those harms, they will suddenly not be against it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;First, it may be a tired cliché but it is nonetheless correct: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

This is a common misunderstanding.  Absence of *proof* is not proof of absence, but absence of *evidence* most certainly is evidence of absence.

Fundamentally, rationality deals with probabilities.  It's about how *likely* it is that any given claim is true.  Evidence, then, is some observation that changes the probability we assign to the accuracy of a particular claim.  We have some initial assessment of the likelihood that the claim is true, and then an observation comes along that either increases or decreases that likelihood.

Now, without going into the formal probability theory, it's a mathematical fact that, if a given observation increases the likelihood that a given claim is accurate, then it must necessarily follow that the lack of that observation decreases the likelihood that the same claim is true.  Depending on the numbers, it might only decrease the likelihood a little bit, but it will *always* decrease it.

Taking a religious example, finding Noah's Ark would act as evidence in favour of the Biblical account.  If we found Noah's Ark, we would assign a higher probability to the claim that the Biblical account was accurate.  It necessarily follows that *not* finding Noah's Ark makes the Biblical account *less* likely to be accurate.

In every walk of life, other than religion, this is intuitively accepted by almost everybody.  People don't believe in leprechauns because there is no evidence for their existence; we don't have arguments about how non-belief in the existence Optimus Prime is a position of faith.",0,1357946359,null,0,false,0,c7vbfn5,t3_16eapa,t1_c7vbfn5,t3_16eapa,null,1430931564,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

It kinda makes me sad, because I got into crosswords when I worked a bar job, and this 'grumpy old git' used to always be at the bar and he was the crossword master. He'd school me through the clues and talk about blues music and swap leadbelly CDs and he'd tell me about his navy life and stuff. I loved that guy, and treasured every slow hour in the pub when I could pick up my biro and stand in the corner doing my crossword with him helping me along.

He could've done the crosswords I was doing in 5 minutes but he never took the piss and guided me gracefully without malice and no more than a rib-tickling 'come on son!' when I was missing the obvious...

I prayed the night would be quiet so I could turn off the radio and stick on a Jerry Reed or Jimmy Reed CD and we'd sit there puzzling over words, and talking about being celtic and how cornwall used to be called 'west wales' (he was a Welshman) and so much other, funny trivial shit....

When he got poorly and the bar seat was vacant for a bit, we were all so sad. But we helped him along, and in his last 6 months, once in a while he'd be there. At the bar, in his corner, saying ""where's the crossword then?""

Even with an oxygen mask round his neck, he'd still pop up for a pint or two of bitter, and despite his illness he was never down or miserable...

The same old cheeky, grumpy cunt since I first known him, and that was 20 years before when he was in the same spot and I was a kid running around in the bar my Dad worked at giving me sweets from the machine.

When he passed, the bar was never the same, there is still a plaque over that bit of the bar saying 'grumpy gits corner' and I've never done a crossword since. That's also why I'm the grumpy old git here, if I could be 1% of how awesome and nice and kind and funny as that guy was I'd be satisfied.

He always said this one thing about me...""you're a young man, fucked up"".

It's beautiful and loving and I miss that bastard loads.

Anyway, [this was his song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbmQQ4RfzVE), or at least a version of it.

I am an american who has recieved excellent emergency services through the nhs and also services in australia . Its a good system and efficiant. The stress of living here and incurring moutains of debt from one medical issue is daunting. Insurance is expensive and not everyone qualifies. I hope we get health care for everyone at some point in my lifetime.

[–]iloveaha 1 point 23 minutes ago
It can be like that here in the states too. I am underinsured and because of this deficit iam struggling to get approval for surgery to have my colon removed and my bladder repaired. I get the shuffle from here to there lots of bad drs. some good ones. Nothings perfect but atleast for brits the nhs is there.

[–]beaumains 9 points 5 hours ago
I don't know what this guy is talking about. As an insured American, I would have to pay my the $4000 deductible and then 20% of the costs above that until I reach the magic cut off point (I forget what that is, maybe 30,000?), after which the insurance company pays everything, unless they deny my claim. So if this had happened to me, I'd be out a ton of money. But at least we're sticking it to the commies right? right?

As for the post linking to our thread being +1 with 2 comments just proves my point even further.

There's Yorkshire Museum, Clifford's Tower, the Castle Museum, to name only a couple - then look round the art gallery, definitely check out the Minster as the architecture and history of it is just breathtaking - then obviously you'll have to go to Betty's for tea - it's expensive but everyone goes there at some point! Then you could always visit the theatre (opposite the road from the art gallery).

There's also a designer outlet outside of the city - if you don't have a car you can take a bus there.

If you want to save money, there's a lot you can do for free too! Window shop, go to The Shambles, go to the gardens of Yorkshire Museum - when I first came to live in York I used to spend entire afternoons just walking around enjoying the sites!

Also, if you decide to go for a nice meal and are into French-style food, book Rustique (in advance, they fill up pretty quickly, the website is http://www.rustiqueyork.co.uk/). They're really quite cheap for what you get, and they're number 1 on Tripadvisor for restaurants in York for a reason!

true,fz6greg,uk,the north west,"Here's my good and bad experience with them after being involved in a pretty serious motorcycle accident. Some of it is pieced together from medical reports and friends as I suffered amnesia and memory problems for a couple of weeks. 

A car pulled out on my on a NSL road, I hit it and went flying in the air. I was knocked unconscious and wasn't breathing. Luckily there were paramedics nearby and possibly a doctor. I assume I started breathing again. I was taken to the nearest hospital by air ambulance. 

In hospital I was scanned and examined by many doctors, basically finding out what was wrong with me. I remember being on a spinal board for what felt like a long time, which was very uncomfortable (imagine lying on a hard ground and not being able to move). In hospital they noted I has a partially collapsed lung, swelling to my knee, a broken finger, and whiplash. I somehow persuaded them to discharge me the same day but don't remember this. The nurses and doctors were excellent, even if I pissed them off a bit by not having much in the way of a short term memory.

I was referred to a hand clinic, and had my arm cast removed (a precaution), and a spint for my finger made. I was booked in for surgery.

I went to the hospital expecting surgery, but after a few hours and consulting a surgeon they decided not to operate. Not expecting this I then had to get a taxi home. 

About 12 days later I went to my GP to get help with my shoulder, I was unable to lift my left arm, however my right arm had seemingly recovered. My GP told me he couldn't do anything and my insurance company needed to sort it out (this is wrong). My GP was very arrogant and seemed to treat me as though I was a waste of time, I am somebody who only goes to the doctors if I am seriously ill. 

Back at the hand clinic I complained about my chest, and my clavicle (I had noticed it was sticking out), the hospital hadn't picked up on it being dislocated. I was then X-rayed and referred to an orthopaedic surgeon and also a psychologist (as a precaution in case I had PTSD, I didn't). It's worth noting that I nothing ever came of this referral to the orthopeadic surgeon, but I did see the psychologist (after having an appointment cancelled on me). 

After several weeks of chasing the hospital up and nothing, I went to see my GP again. I had a bit of an argument with him and he relented and referred me to a bupa orthopaedic hospital. At this point my shoulder was no better and I still couldn't lift my arm.

I received a telephone appoint 2 weeks in the future for the orthopedic hospital. I expected this to be a verbal consultation, as it turned out it was just a massive waste of my time as it was an appointment to book my real appointment. Eventually I saw the consultant a couple of weeks later, who then sent me off for an MRI scan. I then had to chase them up and wait another 2 weeks to get the results. It's worth noting that the scan was a smooth operation. I was seen early, and didn't have to wait at all. This was at a private bupa hospital. 

As it stands I was supposed to have a follow up appointment with the hand speciality in august 2012, the earliest appointment they could give me was december, which they then cancelled on me, and is not scheduled for february 2013. 

I had a follow up appointment about my shoulder, but not have to wait another few months, though this wasn't really delayed.

Bear in mind as well that for at least a few months, despite police reassurance, I was unsure if the car driver's insurance would accept liability, which could affect treatment  (if they accepted it then it's easier to get referred to a private hospital if that will speed speed up treatment). It took about 6 months for the police to prosecute the driver and for the insurance company to accept liability. My case is still ongoing.

**TL;DR:** They are very good at seeing you, especially in emergencies, but after-care can be frustrating and take a very long time.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma#Strategy_for_the_iterated_prisoners.27_dilemma

&gt; Interest in the iterated prisoners' dilemma (IPD) was kindled by Robert Axelrod in his book The Evolution of Cooperation (1984). In it he reports on a tournament he organized of the N step prisoners' dilemma (with N fixed) in which participants have to choose their mutual strategy again and again, and have memory of their previous encounters. Axelrod invited academic colleagues all over the world to devise computer strategies to compete in an IPD tournament. The programs that were entered varied widely in algorithmic complexity, initial hostility, capacity for forgiveness, and so forth.
&gt;
&gt; Axelrod discovered that when these encounters were repeated over a long period of time with many players, each with different strategies, greedy strategies tended to do very poorly in the long run while more altruistic strategies did better, as judged purely by self-interest. He used this to show a possible mechanism for the evolution of altruistic behaviour from mechanisms that are initially purely selfish, by natural selection.
&gt;
&gt; The winning deterministic strategy was tit for tat, which Anatol Rapoport developed and entered into the tournament. It was the simplest of any program entered, containing only four lines of BASIC, and won the contest. The strategy is simply to cooperate on the first iteration of the game; after that, the player does what his or her opponent did on the previous move. Depending on the situation, a slightly better strategy can be ""tit for tat with forgiveness."" When the opponent defects, on the next move, the player sometimes cooperates anyway, with a small probability (around 1–5%). This allows for occasional recovery from getting trapped in a cycle of defections. The exact probability depends on the line-up of opponents.
By analysing the top-scoring strategies, Axelrod stated several conditions necessary for a strategy to be successful.
&gt;
&gt; **Nice**
&gt;
&gt; The most important condition is that the strategy must be ""nice"", that is, it will not defect before its opponent does (this is sometimes referred to as an ""optimistic"" algorithm). Almost all of the top-scoring strategies were nice; therefore, a purely selfish strategy will not ""cheat"" on its opponent, for purely self-interested reasons first.
&gt;
&gt; **Retaliating**
&gt;
&gt; However, Axelrod contended, the successful strategy must not be a blind optimist. It must sometimes retaliate. An example of a non-retaliating strategy is Always Cooperate. This is a very bad choice, as ""nasty"" strategies will ruthlessly exploit such players.

This is something that Guardian and New Statesman readers really need to read.

&gt; **Forgiving**
&gt;
&gt; Successful strategies must also be forgiving. Though players will retaliate, they will once again fall back to cooperating if the opponent does not continue to defect. This stops long runs of revenge and counter-revenge, maximizing points.
&gt;
&gt; **Non-envious**
&gt;
&gt; The last quality is being non-envious, that is not striving to score more than the opponent (note that a ""nice"" strategy can never score more than the opponent).",0,1357948985,null,0,1357949532,0,c7vc787,t3_16eapa,t1_c7vc787,t1_c7vbvbv,null,1430931993,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

They're being placed in grave danger by the orchestrators of the violence and not being protected by their parents.

No, it's another reason that you don't need one. Well not a ""personal God"" anway. I could accept the idea of some sort of pantheist god-in-the-emergent order type idea. 

But it's definitely not the conscious entity in the Quran or Bible.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza#Panentheist.2C_pantheist.2C_or_atheist.3F

&gt; Spinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word ""God"" (Deus) to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. ""Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law....""[84] Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God[85] is the antithesis to the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza#Spinoza_in_literature_and_popular_culture

&gt;  Albert Einstein named Spinoza as the philosopher who exerted the most influence on his world view (Weltanschauung). Spinoza equated God (infinite substance) with Nature, consistent with Einstein's belief in an impersonal deity. In 1929, Einstein was asked in a telegram by Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein whether he believed in God. Einstein responded by telegram: ""I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.""",0,1357950589,null,0,1357950847,0,c7vcn3q,t3_16eapa,t1_c7vcn3q,t1_c7vcias,null,1430932228,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

As for governments in Westminster or Stormont. Westminster is keeping back as much as it can as they can piss everybody off at the same time getting involved.  

Now a few DUP members of councils are talking about flag debates (Limavady has a nationalist majority so for them reopening a debate that was passed is not going to happen. Whereas county down just flies its county flag and nothing else to avoid this sillyness) and even they know, on the whole, that its pretty stupid and is not going to help business in Belfast city centre, the older UUP will be pissed off about this, they have always been about business, but now shipping and linen have gone I'm not sure what big business is in the north. 

Unionist parties will have to be seen to do something lest they lose their power/influence. whether they care about it I don't know, are they representing the people or vested interests, I can't be sure.. tit for tat, tick tock tick.

This whole police/media campaign is fishy fishy fishy.  They are effectively throwing wet sponges at a cardboard cutout of a dead man.  

They have yet to say what he actually really did?  ""Sexual offence"" is government terminology for quite a wide range of things these days.  So is the word ""abuse"".  

&gt; Some 214 crimes were recorded across 28 police force areas, including 34 of rape or penetration, the report said.

Crimes were recorded?  Well a crime has to be proven in court before it is a crime, for starters.

true,cech_mate,present,Didier Drogba is a Legend,"&gt;Yeah... Lampard abused his leverage over the club when he had the chance and now possesses very little leverage. 

* How did he abuse his leverage. at 29 he was at the top of his game and  probably one of the best midfielder at that time. making about 80K to 90K anyone would demand a pay rise at that age.

&gt; Lampard is one of my favorite players of all time. But I can recognise that players move on and their time at the Bridge does have to come to an end at some point and that's just the nature of club football.

* In his case he's not moving on he's being forced to leave. That the what I have problem with. he's a club legend and forcing him out is not the way he will like his time at the Bridge to end. that is like a slap in the face. It nt the nature of club football. Scholes, Giggs, Henry, Puyol, Xavi, Casillas, Raul, Maldini, Gattusso, and the list goes on all left at their own will and some will. Chelsea on the other hand is forcing out lampard, Terry Ashley Cole and when his contract end Petr Cech. 

&gt; I very much hope he can go and get that record, maybe with the help of a Henry-esque loan

* Do you really think he will come back to Chelsea under Roman regime when he's being forced out. 
* When he leave i don't think he will be leaving Europe to settle down in China or America.

&gt;but we have to blood in the new generation.

* Remember our London Rival Arsenal they have blood in the new generation and it doesn't look good for them, no trophy for 7 years and counting. Im not against revitalizing the squad. You need someone that the young players can look up too when the going get though.

I know I shouldn't: we've had a terrible record at Oakwell in recent years - both in terms of results *and* performances - but it's a Saturday, for once (I think that in the past it has always been on a weeknight) and Warnock's been able to break a fair few hoodoos so far. Moreover, Barnsley are in disarray with them already being on a dismal run and failing to bring in a new manager before the game. My prediction: **2-1 to Leeds.**

Here's the starting XI and formation I think Warnock will select:

---------------Kenny

Byram---Lees---Tate---Peltier

Green---Barkley---Austin---Tonge

----------Diouf---Becchio

I sincerely hope that he brings Lees back into the defence, as Tate and Pearce just isn't cutting it as a partnership in the heart of defence. Personally, I would drop Tate and have Pearce play with Lees once again, but Warnock just doesn't seem interested in dropping Tate (or Peltier, for that matter).

I can't see him bringing Barkley in and leaving him on the bench - even if he has only been here for a day. If he does, I bet that Norris will replace him in midfield.

It happens all the time, as players get so hyped up by the media and fans that there's a huge amount of pressure on them to excel.

The same is quite likely true of Torres, and do any of you remember Sergei Rebrov? 1 Goal in 30 appearances (for us, as a striker) in '01-'02, after being lauded as a huge talent who was destined for great things etc.

Being over-hyped can absolutely kill a career. Heskey springs to mind - if he'd never played for England no-one would call him shit, just an ok mid-table kinda fella.

We'll eventually revisit the Final Question, the fields of Trenzalore etc. I suspect that somewhere in the build-up to that event or in the episode where that arc comes to a close that the Doctor will reveal his name to River. (Maybe River will even be the one asking the question?)

I'm pretty sure we haven't seen the last of River; Alex Kingston is on board for Season 7 after all. 
But the relationship between River and The Doctor is ultimately a very tragic one, that much has been made clear. She travels opposite to the Doctor's time stream and he'll know her less and less, his first kiss is her last, and she's willing to sacrifice more than any other companion just to keep him happy as depicted in varous episodes.

On the other hand, I like to think River really is happy in that time span where they both know each other well and that there is some romance in that period. The Doctor may not be a very romantic person, but he really is interested in River, initially because of the mystery and danger she represents, later because of the undeniable chemistry between the two. We've seen in mini-sodes that the Doctor has taken her on adventures alone, and 'Flesh and Stone' reveals that at some point in their lives, the Doctor made a habit of kissing her when he dropped her off at Stormcage.

I don't expect a lot of on-screen classic romance to come, but they're very much like an old married couple - Amy even described them as such.

However, to make a guesstimate: for FY 2011/12 (i.e. 4 April 2011 - 3 April 2012) they spent £3.330m on staff salaries ([source](http://parliamentarystandards.org.uk/About%20Us/Corporate%20Publications/Annual%20Report%20and%20Accounts%202011-%202012.pdf), p. 34) and their median total compensation was £30,500 (same source, p. 37)  so, making some huge but generally-accurate assumptions (that the median approximates the mean, that full-time and part-time costs are linear, and that staff costs are approximately 150% of salary costs - this is what I used to use when in the UK government) this would be (£3m33 / (150% * £30k5)) ~= 72 FTE staff, ish. They probably have some consultants/*etc.* from time to time, too.

Disclaimer: I used to work for the executive of the UK Government (not the Parliamentary branch), and ""volunteered"" for IPSA as one of their swathe of trainers to advise all MPs, new and returning, after the 2010 General Election as to the system that IPSA has created and how to use it. However, I do not and have never been paid by IPSA, and don't know this kind of stuff for sure. If you definitely want to know, you should write to them under the Freedom of Information Act (and if you do do so, please ask them to pro-actively publish information like this on data.gov.uk or similar, like other government and parliamentary bodies do).

Though if you are talking about today, those days are long gone. The laws have gotten much more strict and the punishments for such offenses now/the chances of getting caught are very high. The original Chelsea hooligans are either locked up in prison, those who were already in their late 40s at the time are now old and the young ones have gotten into trouble or sorted their lives around. Many of them even stopped watching football realizing their entire interest was fighting for the team and not watching it. The last time I remember hearing about the real headhunters was in 2010 when we drew Cardiff.

More over it is something much more frowned upon then it ever was because now it is just a bunch of 5 or 6 chavs texting to set up fights at best and calling it hooliganism, they don't even bother staying on the same side most of the time. 

Most firms have far been dissolved, you will get the odd members still at games and hints of their traces in flags and chants, sometimes they leave their skull with CFC on places where fans leave stuff just to remind everyone they are still alive but that complete effort to go firm v firm no longer happens. I think the Millwall Bushwackers though still enjoy hooliganism more than football. If any firm still will be ready to meet you at a fight as close to tradition as possible it will be those fuckers.

Edit : Just saw your question in the post body and yes you do get a feel at times at games when someone gets into verbal abuse and you see that spark in their eye saying ""I'm going to knock your lights out if the stewards weren't here"", seeing this from a 40-50 something man immediately makes me think they might have been part of the headhunters but it is something I shrug off as me being too MI5.

How we look playing isn't always a guarantor, though - we play ""better-looking"" football now than we did under Houllier most of the time, but out of all his full seasons in charge, we only finished outside the top 4 once, and averaged 68 points per season.

&gt;  That's not including the fact that our young players will be so much better in a couple of years.

But only if key players stay - I don't care what Sterling or Borini are like in 2 years, neither would really replace Suarez if he leaves (and I'm skeptical about our ability to replace Suarez with the money received from him with an equivalent talent - the longer we're outside the top 4, the harder it becomes to convince players of that quality to gamble on us).

&gt; I'll admit we're inconsistent at the moment but that'll come as the team matures.

We also lack depth - for a title challenge, you need depth. We didn't come 2nd instead of 1st in 2008-09 because we lacked one or two quality players, we came 2nd instead of 1st because our options from the bench were El Zhar and N'Gog.

true,szlafarski,lfc99,,"The role of the CAM in a 433 isn't the same as a 4231. Rather than taking the ball from the two holding and feeding the widemen and CF, the role in Rodger's system is different. 

The two ""holding"" mids have two different roles - one to close down deeper and recycle, and one to carry the ball forward, rather than just receiving and playing the ball forward. The ""recycler"" moves more central as the ""playmaker"" moves forward to link up with the CAM. 

The CAM then plays the ball to one of the three attacking players (deeper mids generally play to the fullbacks). The ""playmaker"" keeps moving up, and the CAM drops slightly in behind the playmaker, either preparing to take the ball again and move forward looking for a killer pass, or as a safety net in the event of a counter from the opposition. 

As both the playmaker and CAM get forward, the defensive/holding mid moves deeper, allowing the fullbacks to push and one CB to move up (why we've seen Agger moving up a lot since Lucas returned).

The CAM in the 433 needs to be quick at making a safe pass in order to let the playmaker get forward. Allow works well in this role (during the holding to offensive transition) because of his off the ball movement. The only time it doesn't work great is if we go from defensive to offensive by winning the ball in midfield, because at this stage Allen is expected to be a ball winner because we don't have a killer CAM yet.

true,fun_cooker,tennant,Tennant,"I've been re-watching new-Who with my girlfriend (who has never seen it before) and trying to figure out why I like RTD so much more than Moffat. 

I will be the first to admit there is a healthy dose of ""you never forget your first doctor-ness"" to my feelings but I don't think that is all of it.

I feel like RTD is human race fan fiction (how often do 9 or 10 comment on how amazing humanity is?) and boil down to the doctor meeting someone he finds truly amazing them facing down impossible odds by being incredibly clever and then a big finish which usually involves me, the viewer, crying uncontrollably either out of joy or sadness. I also felt like RTD had a very strong idea of who the characters were.  

Moffat's episodes from the RTD era, I think, gives an indication of what is to come. They are some of the best written most fascinating episodes of their seasons but I also felt myself frequently thinking ""rose/the doctor wouldn't ever do that!"" The characterization is sacrificed just a little for the sake of telling a really good story. This leads to things like the doctor now seeming to give a wink and a nod while telling his friends that he doesn't like guns as he leaves the room so they can kill everyone. This was an interesting ""they just pushed him to the breaking point"" thing the first time.

I think Moffat's stories and concepts are great; when he's on I think Moffat is more imaginative than RTD by a long shot. I think the production is beautiful and I love Amy and Rory but overall I feel like Moffat writes like he is his own version of Sherlock. The stories are witty and brilliant but also emotionally cold and overly satisfied with themselves and (to me) ultimately a little alienating. I love how complex the longer stories are but sometimes things are wrapped up so quickly with references going back entire seasons that I'm never sure how anyone is supposed to keep up with him and emotional scenes aren't really given long enough for the viewer to feel them before the doctor is jumping around and complimenting himself again.

**tl;dr**
rtd wrote more emotionally impactful though frequently much campier stories
Moffat writes better more interesting stories with no heart.

true,imnotcreative1,null,null,"I just had an argument about this. Moffatt is really big on character development. That's why Amy and Rory were on for so long, there is a progression that happens with their characters. You see Amy go from wide eyed and innocent and sassy in season 5 to sassy, mature and womanly in season 6 to sassy, hardened and slightly bitter in season 7. What made the first half of season 7 kind of suck was the hardened version of Amy, who had lost her child and failed to produce another one. She is an older woman, still in love with her rory but no longer in love with her doctor but rather knowledgeable of him the way we as audience members never could be. We lost that wonder and whimsy that made the companion the surrogate viewer. 

With rtd we never had that problem because he had his companions for one season and they only changed in the most basic ways. They fell out of love, they fell in love, they learned and matured but emotionally the remained the same people. What this did was provide a never changing feeling of freshness amongst the characters who could only be so deep. The deepest during this time was Donna and the shallowest by far was Martha. 

People bitch about moffatt because he is more of a storyteller than rtd. He likes grand schemes and writes a series like a really long, really intricate movie. He loves characters and because of this people are required to watch suffering and maturation. With rtd we only got either but we didn't get both at the same time. He doesn't disappoint the viewers by changing the characters and letting them grow. We get so attached to ""our doctor"" and ""our companions"" that when they suffer and when they maturate, we question, what the hell just happened to the wide eyed red headed scottish girl in a sleepy English town?

Two things to note here, hooligans were loyal to their gang, which was affiliated with a club, it's a subtle difference which means the gang came before the club. Their loyalties weren't truly to the club or football, if they were why would they jeopardise the clubs future by getting bans from Europe and fines imposed? 

Secondly, most British supporters of the clubs would rather forget those days and are glad that we can now take our families to matches without fear of them being caught up in or exposed to violence. Hooligans may seem like decent bunch of loyal lads but they weren't, they were at worst psychopathic cunts who would stop at nothing to hurt others.

Britain's equivalent food drawcard are its gastro pubs. But good *street* food outside of the major cities is difficult to obtain.

This is why the American food gets a foothold. 

As a side note, *market* food is also something that's missing. If you go to any markets in Sydney, Australia, you're guaranteed to get some pretty good food. Recently I was in Berlin and I went to a weekend market. The food was incredibly good, they even had a place selling freshly shucked oysters and glasses of wine. It was great gourmet food on the street level.

The interesting thing about Australia is that it doesn't really have much in the way of ""traditional"" food - unless you want [campfire-cooked goanna](http://www.flickr.com/photos/63258930@N04/5753365694/lightbox/) or kangaroo.

true,NewRandomHero,english,Luton,"I'd like to offer my opinion, too - hopefully someone out there reads it.

I lost my grandfather 10 days ago to lung cancer. He had been diagnosed less than 18 months prior, after being told he probably developed it a year before that.

The NHS did not do one thing wrong by him. From the get-go with his battle, they provided state-of-the-art equipment for him, with an on-call nurse who came just about every day for the last few months, and every couple of days before that. He was given all the medication he could ever need or want, coupled with chemo and radio. They did absolutely everything they could to help him. 

Sadly, about 6 months ago, they told him that it will be terminal. They continued to treat him, however, in an attempt to make him as comfortable as possible.

I live in Switzerland, so seeing him was very hard. I had said that I would not be back for Christmas until my father called me at the start of December and said that I really do need to come back. So, on the 28th, I boarded a plane and headed on home. I got to our home in the UK at around midnight; 8am the next morning, my grandfather went into hospital for the last time. He had contracted a few different infections and one of his lungs had collapsed. By this point, the cancer had spread throughout his body. 

As I'm sure you're all aware, Norovirus is roaming the corridors of British hospitals, which has caused visitation limits to be put in place - namely, only 1 visitor per bed. The nurses didn't bat an eyelid when they saw us coming to visit him. At any point in his stay, there were four people at his bed. For that, I am extremely grateful.

So, I left the hospital, and on New Year's Eve flew back to where I sit now. We lost him, as I say, on the second. His two sons and wife were with him, and the doctors and nurses ensured he wasn't in any pain.

The funeral is on the 23rd.

So that's one experience with the NHS. A&amp;E might not be too great sometimes, but when it really matters, they can certainly pull their finger out. And that's just one reason why, when anyone has any unkind words about the NHS in my presence, they receive a courteous, ""Fuck you.""

Of these, 3,850 have a case to answer, with some evidence that can go to court (24.5%)

Of these, 2,910 end up in court (75.6%)

Of these, 1,070 are found guilty (36.7%)

Now, what we need to do, is chart this over time. It may be that the different profile of different crimes means the reporting rate / case to answer / end up in court vary. 

I work with analytics in my work (kind of related to statistics) and you can never take these things out of context. It is very easy to take the highest estimate, 'up to 95000', then simply say that only 1,070 are convicted, and you have made an amazing political point.

What actually matters is understanding the different stages as they all affect each other, if reporting rate goes up, it may well be that more 'low quality' cases are in that, and cases-to-trial goes down (e.g. where sex occurred, the girl felt it was rape, the guy didn't, and she was scared/confused so she made no indications to stop ergo you can't build a case on that - it doesn't meet the Mens Rea criteria for rape).

In my job we wouldn't take a statistic out of context usually, we would compare it to the different stages (Like I have above) and then compare it year on year (with green for good and red for bad). Then you get an instant visual impact of what's happening, and the change. To use an example: when looking at tax avoidance, we get upset at '£x billion avoided tax!' but if you look at %ages of total take, if its going down, thats a positive sign.

So my question would be, as bad as the situation looks, if we compare it to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 years ago, what would be the equivalent figures and %ages at each stage?",0,1357985272,null,0,false,0,c7vjuua,t3_16ete7,t1_c7vjuua,t1_c7viwkr,null,1430935765,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,Mr_Will,null,null,"My figures are real, and pretty conservative. &gt;Well at the moment im in my 3rd year of a pretty demanding science degree, whilst I might have time to work part time, I doubt it if I have to take time to drive there, which at minimum wage would detract from how much It'd be worth it anyway.

&gt;Gym and sports teams are hobbies but pretty essential life style choice too, socialising and staying fit are pretty important to me at least.

&gt;I house share for 365 a month in a shitty part of town, of my friends who don't go to university that share flats or houses with other professionals, family or partners pay maybe 500 a month. 

&gt;I don't know what planet you live on that a student has more than people that are working, especially on a decent salary of the 30k+ like I suggested. 

&gt;My income is my 3 student loans (1.15k 3 times in the whole year) , other than suplementary work over summer (which is hard enough to find for anything less than minimum wage given I can only commit short term), that is all of the money I have to last a year, compared to a professional salary, that is nothing.

&gt;Also a lot of your figures are from a different planet. Nurseries for 250 pound per week? Also nurseries will be 1 or 2 years probably. 200 a month for car insurance, and others just seem a bit high. 50 pound per month travel card. If you are in london and paying that much for travel why would you even have a car

Oh, woe is me, you can only find work at minimum wage. Guess what, same is true for a lot of the population but you get an instant ~20% extra by not paying tax. 

There will be a couple of good years once you start working but before you get responsibilities when (assuming you are still sharing but not saving for a deposit) you will be slightly better off. After that, life gets hard. Harder than you realise. 

My figures are correct. Childcare is around £50 per day per child, from 9 months until they are nearly 5. There are a few small bungs from the government but they don't go far towards it. The other big cost of children is housing. If I was sharing in this bit of town it would be around the £700 mark including bills. If I need to afford somewhere big enough for a child as well, it suddenly jumps to £1500+

I only put £100 for all the cars running costs, about £50 per month for insurance and £50 for tax, MOT, etc. That doesn't include the purchase cost or breakdowns. It's about enough to run an old 1.0 hatchback. The car is needed because getting a family about by public transport is expensive and difficult and the public transport links once you get this far out of London are only really designed for commuting. The £50 for fuel will do about 300 miles per month, or about 1/3rd of the national average, so I'm expecting most travel will be done by public transport, there are just some journeys where it's much much easier and cheaper by car. 

16-25 is when you have the most disposable income, student or not. It's been proven time and time again. Look at the number of your peers with smartphones, decent laptops, designer clothes, the latest games for their ps3/xbox, gym memberships, takeaways, nights out every week, shop bought lunches every day. These will all be unaffordable luxuries at some point in your life. 

I'm not saving things don't get better (they do). Just don't think you are so hard done to. I financed my own way through uni without assistance so I know what you are feeling, but it still ranks amongst the easiest times of my life.

As far as I can tell, the single biggest reason for the death of photography on the high street is simply online shopping. When the internet retailers have next to no overheads to look after, there's not a chance the high street places can compete, which is why everyone goes in there to get advice and then buys online. Not anymore! 


And yeh Currys/PC World do carry cameras, but they have a rubbish selection, never get the exciting new things in quickly, and (generally speaking, there are plenty of exceptions) the staff just don't have enough specialist experience. Ask them anything which wasn't in the Canon training seminar and you'll just get a confused look.

You have a problem.

&gt;It took me 5 minutes to find 3 examples of people who define themselves as unionist/loyalist

I found one, a curiously new account named after a phrase I used in an earlier argument. Interesting finding a unionist who registers solely to to defend nationalism anonymously.

And just so we're clear who else is making the same points as me check out this [Dublin journalist](http://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/lets-be-honest-how-would-we-feel-if-our-tricolour-was-taken-down-brby-victoria-white-219123.html)

&gt;The North is part of the UK. The union flag is the flag of the UK. The lack of any threat to the North’s sovereignty was, I thought, an intrinsic part of the Good Friday Agreement. 

.
&gt;The SDLP and Sinn Féin attempted to score an opportunistic political point by stopping the flag flying on city hall. Predictably, unionists resisted. Alliance got in on the act and made the mess worse. 

I’m sure they meant well, but they showed about as much wisdom as Solomon without the mitigating force of the rightful mother’s love. They cut the peace baby in two and neither bit works any more. 

.
&gt;People talk about flying both the Tricolour and the union flag from city hall, as if that would be a solution. But joint sovereignty has not been agreed. The union flag is still the national flag. 

I could go on quoting from her, and I would presume the tribal hot-air dealers on here would disagree with everything she says, simply because it's not in keeping with the way of the circlejerk.

&gt;It is being posted by the normal, rational people FROM ALL SIDES

In your head. In reality you've no to call out the politics of internet accounts like that without some kind of proof. At least I pointed out I get downvoted *even when posting up neutral content, as it doesn't contain enough hate*, I get downvoted when responding to simple intolerance ('I hate this/that') and when a common insult comes my way it's upvoted. That is pure politics. Same too with the editorialising of the submissions that make it to the frontpage.

The longer we're out of the CL, the more difficult it becomes to convince quality players to take a gamble on us. At the time we picked up Suarez, we'd only been out for one season and had the legitimate excuse of financial troubles that were now behind us. He also had the drawcard of playing in an attacking partnership with Gerrard &amp; Torres, even if that never happened.

Now? A quality player is being convinced to come to a club that has finished mid-table for 3 consecutive seasons, probably 4, despite significant investment, has potentially seen players leave not because of a lack of finances to push the club forward but a lack of results, and doesn't have many drawcards to play alongside - yes, everyone would love to play with Gerrard, but that's about it; and he's getting older.

&gt;Their passing is beautiful. They knew how to use Torres regardless of whether he lacked speed or agility. Not like Chelsea playing long balls and expecting him to be able to catch them. The guys not the same anymore. Stop complaining and work with what you got!

* You're blaming chelsea for Torres failure in this other comment.

&gt;Thank you. Finally someone who understands. I got tired arguing with people. Our problem is not Torres but the team itself.

* Im just loving this.

&gt;Did you watch the game? What the hell did they give him? How many fucking times did he even touch the ball? The guy is out of place, he's not suited for Chelsea. When he plays for Spain he gets the Golden Boot. It's not Torres but Chelsea. Like Benetiz said this team is transitioning. I don't expect it to end soon because they are once again switching managers at the end of the season. Also our defense is shit. I swear I knew we were losing this game. One mistake on defense then they took advantage of it. We're not a consistent team.

* 

&gt;I have already accepted the fact that most of you have no clue what they are talking about. The fact that you think Torres is the problem shows just how much you know. Good thing you guys don't manage the team.

* 

&gt;Beautiful! I agree with you 100%!! I feel like we don't know how to properly feed Torres the ball. He plays like crap then goes to the Euro and wins the Golden boot?? Something is wrong on our part! Regardless of whether he scores or not he's an excellent team player who isn't selfish.

true,throwaway23403,null,null,"It's worth pointing out that for a lot of this period there was a sense that the NHS was running down its resources. Real terms spending after 2000 has increased 80%, and apparently has had little effect except building up that reserve again. So the advantage over continental systems over the 1979-2005 period may come from that effect.

My opinion is that the NHS is an excellent bare-bones system, which will treat serious, life-threatening illnesses with great efficiency, but I think it is not so great for more marginal cases. I'll briefly explain the issues I've had (throw-away because I don't want this tied to my main account): I have a coordination disorder which means that I put more stress on my body than is usual, in Germany if you have this disorder the health service will send you for a couple of weeks every year to a health camp where you can resolve the sort of low-level niggling injuries which continuously arise. If I every mention this disorder to a GP, I am met with a blank stare, and a statement that there's nothing offered within the local trust. 

I had a problem with my achilles which went on for three years, almost certainly arising from the disorder, and GPs would either say something along the lines of 'you're young, you'll be fine', or send you to a physio for one or two appointments. The NHS is set up to deal with acute injuries, not ongoing low-level problems. And then the extent of inactivity caused by this achilles problem has lead to all sorts of other health problems, which I will probably now have for life. In my case, it's rather like having a dentistry service which does no preventative care, and offers an excellent denture service. It is also sometimes more expensive in the long run to just treat complications. You can also see [the same sort of effect with diabetes care](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17829012).

Abortion is *already* illegal in some ways.
 If you go through a list of time periods to kill people people will say 'no, no, no, no,  ok that's alright""

""I (along with the rest of the world*) don't consider that foetus to be a human being with any sort of rights at that early point in development."" - this is your argument for allowing abortion.   

""So sure, it is ""accepted"" by people, but that doesn't mean people think it is right, or should be allowed... and that is the real issue here, isn't it?"" - this is your argument against circumcision

I would say that abortion is 'accepted'  (by law) but that doesn't people think it is right or should be allowed.

As far as bullying, people go after anything they perceive as being different. Naturally red headed people make up 1-6% of the population (depending on geography) which is slightly less than gay individuals (est. 4-10%).    

But people will ""pick on"" anything that is a minority. Weight, race, sexual preference, sub-group (goth, new age, rocker, etc), religion, or even things like clothing/fashion choice.    

Unfortunately it seems almost part of human nature in order to form a ""pecking order"" or some kind of superiority within society.   

With society being massive now compared to small villages (where the behaviour likely serves more of a purpose) the behaviour doesn't stop, it continues but has no impact except making people feel crappy.    

I'm not sure what can be done. It never stops, it just shifts. Things that used to be acceptable to make fun of now aren't, and instead of it ending it just shifts to the latest ""thing"" that ""everyone"" ""hates.""    

A few years ago it was people of a middle-eastern look. Then it shifted to the overweight. Right now I would say gay people are really ""in"" again (thanks to the gay marriage debates).       

Just yesterday I had some drunken idiot talking shit about me for no good reason. Why? Who knows. The dude thought it was funny and got the finger.    

Point is I don't see this going away any time soon and I'm not sure anyone has any real answers. All we can do is keep it at bay and make examples out of people who turn their mean words into physical actions (e.g. ""gay bashing"").

Come on now, look at them, most of them are clearly wasters who can't be arsed looking for jobs with nothing better to do at 3pm on a weekday. And because of their actions they have just secured their unemployment in place for a while to come. Not just for them, but for the rest of decent folk who actually want work as well.

&gt;but no one gives a shit until it erupts into rioting. 

Quite frankly, people will give less of a shit now than they did before. If things were being so tough, why not start protesting years ago before the flag stuff? If they protested then, every week around the city, without disrupting traffic or rioting, they would have gotten a message across, and people may have taken to their point of view.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Everything else aside here, one issue with abortion which makes it completely incomparable to these other issues is that being pregnant affects the person who is pregnant too. If they are pregnant against their will or wishes then they are being affected in a way in which they do not want.

Inflicting harm or similar upon another person against their wishes is the basis of human laws, and is generally the only model which makes sense. This is based on the maximum amount of liberty for everyone. This is why people are against laws which limit what people can do in their own privacy in a way which does no one else any harm. The harm principle, for example, basically states that these are the *only* cases that the law should even concern.

Now take pregnancy - harm is being done to the pregnant person against their wishes, and they are the person who is being unfairly affected by it. It might suck for the foetus but that foetus can't live without the host, so unfortunately it doesn't have that right. If it wants to go live externally somewhere without forcing itself upon the mother then that is fine, but of course we know that is impossible. But common law would suggest that that is no issue of the mother. An analogy: If for example I could only stay alive by stealing food from your kitchen, does that mean it should be illegal to stop me? Stopping me would kill me, but as I am affecting you in a way that you don't wish, you have the right to stop me even though it means my certain death.

Now take circumcision - you are harming someone else, against their will, for no reason at all. By all measures, that is illegal. By all ethical guidelines, that is wrong. And by any morals that aren't based on a religious text saying ""this is okay"", it is immoral.

All in all, you've drawn an absolutely ridiculous comparison - and that is only on the harm principle, and basis of much of common law around the world.

Basically what you stated is wrong - because based on this, people agree that abortion should be allowed, but disagree that circumcision should be allowed.

You seem to be saying that allowing both is based on the same arguments, but this is **not true**. The fact of the matter is that allowing abortion, and disallowing circumcision is actually based on the *same* common argument.",0,1358002608,null,0,false,0,c7vltn1,t3_16bhjf,t1_c7vltn1,t1_c7vln0l,null,1430936671,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Defensively we were excellent, Dawson had one of his best games in a long time.


Losing Sandro was a blow I hope it's nothing serious, however Scott Parker came on and was very good.


Defoe looked dangerous early on but faded, Bale was marked out of the game.


Harry was only interested in spoiling, we had no space to play football, I think if we'd held our shape better out wide we could have alleviated this somewhat leaving more space in the middle.


Ade was shocking, he had the first touch of a brick wall today.


The result, obviously disappointing however not a bad result and far from a disaster. We're 6 points clear of Arsenal who have two games in hand, points on the board are always better. If we win our home games and pick up draws away that will see us home in at least 4th.  


3rd and 4th are going to be decided in the Chelsea v Spurs v Arsenal games, we just need to consistently collect points until then.


We played well but came up against a team with no interest in anything other than putting everyone behind the ball.

My first reaction is to think ""how can I send her money?"" but... there's millions out there like her, for every one person the charities help there's millions more going without. It feels especially shitty because I pay a lot of tax (something like 40%) and one reason I don't move to America is because I like to be able to think I'm helping people, that I'm being a nice person even if it's in a very small way... and so to see people living like this when my fortunate situation should be helping them is sad.

true,sipos0,uk,London,"On the one hand, as a physicist, I think more people doing physics is a good thing. Still, I suspect that the increase in applicants to Manchester is mostly at the expense of other university's physics degree programs, some of which I think probably offer better teaching than Manchester*. 

On the other hand, as a (particle) physicist, I passionately hate Brian Cox's shows. I also find him annoying as a person too. Brian Cox: if you are reading it, don't take it personally, I find lots of people annoying. 

If people are applying to Manchester because they are interested in the LHC (as the article suggests) and they think Brian Cox is particularly well placed to teach them about it, they are probably mistaken. There are people who are doing research at the LHC full-time (rather than spending much of their time at the BBC) both at Manchester and other universities with strong research programs in particle physics (e.g. Oxford, Imperial which both probably have degrees that will be more useful to people in the future) who are probably better placed to do this to be honest (some of them are even also good at teaching). 

If I were someone looking for somewhere to do a physics degree and was interested primarily in particle physics (as I guess people choosing their university on the basis of Brian Cox being there probably are, if they aren't just obsessed with fame), I would choose either Oxford or Imperial (which have the largest particle physics groups in the UK and are both excellent universities). Oxford probably has a better reputation generally and, that will probably make a bigger difference to someone in the long run (especially if you don't end up doing physics research) but, personally, I think Imperial has a better physics department and London is a way more interesting place to live than Oxford.

For example, I started working in an industrial estate in Leicester. I got to talking with one of the lunch-van people and I asked him if he left his van in the estate over night. He said that he didn't because there was a gypsy camp down the road. He used to leave his van there but the gypsies would break into the van EVERY TIME but they wouldn't steal anything except for the gas bottles. He couldn't understand the motive and he got sick of fixing the locks on his van.

He finally gave up leaving his van and has to tow it out to the estate every single day.

true,sipos0,uk,London,"I don't think it is necessarily just being a popularizer of science that makes you hated. 

Certainly in the case of Brian Cox, he is widely hated in particle physics not because he is a popularizer of science per-se but, because he is probably the most famous person in particle physics despite the fact that there are people who have achieved much more in terms of research (many of whom are probably paid less, less secure in their jobs and have lower status than him). 

I suspect that he also would not be a professor if it were not for his broadcasting career too. If he were a professor of public understanding of science or something like that, that would be fine but, as far as I am aware, he is a professor of physics so it seems a bit undeserved to me. 

I think it is probably the fact that they are famous, more so than the people who are responsible for the discoveries that they popularise, that is perceived as unfair and causes them to be hated in their own field. 

Stephen Hawking is responsible for a lot (though much less than Brian Cox) of popularisation of physics and applied mathematics but, he is not hated. I suspect that that is partly due to his significant achievements in his field (though, perhaps people who work in a field more closely related to his than mine resent the fact that he is more famous than other people in his field who are equally or more deserving?). Richard Dawkins is also not as widely hated I think as Brian Cox within his field and I suspect that him having made a clear decision to leave his research and concentrate on popularising science instead is part of that.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"""This has been the worst I've seen Leeds play this season."" - Eddie Gray, speaking at half time on *Yorkshire Radio*.

That about sums it up. Everyone went into the game thinking, ""There's no way it can be as bad as the last two games we've played at Oakwell."" In a sense they're right: we're not losing, but that's probably because Barnsley sold their top scorer ahead of the game. The performance itself, however, has been every bit as bad as the last two games we've played.

They've just beaten us in work rate, quality and attacking intent - in other words, all areas of the game. However, our piss poor performance has stemmed from an awful midfield. Tonge genuinely looks like a player who hasn't touched the ball for three weeks, as he gives it away more often than not, while Austin and Norris have struggled to even put a foot on the ball. Since Barkley and Diouf are our only players with close ball control, they've been the wide players of a front three, but getting them into the game has been an ordeal - and when we do give the ball to them, the crosses go straight to the goalkeeper.

It's awful and I'm not even sure if we can save the performance. Tonge needs to be subbed - I'd put McCormack on and play him on the left side of the front three, with Barkley moving into the middle of the park. I also prefer Green in the middle to Norris, as he tracks back a lot better but, in fairness, he isn't much better at looking after the ball.

The defence is also in a right state: Pearce and Tate **cannot** play together! But he won't change it now.

One of the things I do with patients that both they and I find very rewarding is after the consultant has come and told them they have a pulmonary embolism, or a pnuemothorax or a sprained ankle or just a sore throat, is to see if they have any questions about it. The consultant will have asked this as well, and the patient will say ""no thats all fine doctor"".  I ask them 20 minutes later and its more like

* ""well I understand that there is a clot in my lung, but what has that got to do with my leg?""  
* ""why do I need to have this scan and not just an x-ray or a blood test?"" 
* ""I've heard of warfarin before, doesn't it make you bruise a lot?""

 It usually ends up me drawing diagrams of the venous system or the anatomy of the chest, or little venn diagrams of various pathogens, outlining how drugs work.  I enjoy it partly because the patients often appreciate it, but also it reminds me of one of something Richard Feynman wrote/said  about teaching, in that if you can't explain the results of your experiement or your new theory about the universe to a an audience of physics undergradutes, then you do not understand it yourself. 

I think sometimes these physics professors who get all uppity about successful populisers of their work are limited, in that while they can work with their knowledge and manipulate it,  they don't truly deep down understand it.

Mr Andaway, if you feel you have anyone to blame for your unemployment, lack of education and poor opportunities it is yourself and your parents (and probably their parents before them) faults.

I went to a Protestant school and turned out just fine, thanks. I am currently in University as are many of my male classmates who I went to Secondary School and even Primary School with. The ones that didn't make it past Secondary School were **mostly** the ones with the ""this is shit"" and bone idle attitude when it came down to learning and doing work. The ones whose parents never came to open evenings, progress report days, who never sent them to school in ironed clothes with clean shoes and all the equipment they needed to complete the school day. The ones who boasted about being let out at all hours, drinking and smoking at 14 etc. 

If anything your 'culture' is part of the reason you've been held back in life. I can't speak for Catholic or Integrated schooled people but I'm sure there are success and fail stories exactly the same as what I described above, it's absolutely nothing to do with being Protestant or even being male. You just had zero motivation to do well in school. Now do yourself and your (future?) children a favour and go and get educated so you can encourage your children to do the same and not get stuck in the vicious cycle that you hate so much.

The earliest being about 2 months down the line from the consultation.   I do not have a date for my chest surgery yet.  I need to have a CT scan, a lung function test and a heart echo test before they give me a date.  My Heart Echo is on the 23rd of Jan, my CT on 29th and the lung function is in the middle of Feb.  The Surgeon said they'll do the operation after the summer because the recovery time is long and painful and his words 'it would be gutting to spend the summer laid up'. My chest condition is not particularly urgent at this stage.  Just heart murmors and impaired lung function, which sounds bad but when you consider that the surgeon is usually removing massive tumors from people's chests and performing real life saving surgery - you can't really grumble too much.

I've never seen much. A couple of scuffles with policemen/opposition fans at away matches, but there's certainly not an organized presence like there was in the 1980s and to a lesser extent the 1990s. The real football firms documentary, as well as the incident against Cardiff, suggests there are still a few headcases around but they're no longer a big problem. There was a documentary about the headhunters in the late 1990s ([here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ_Lr5MlEbM), but I'd say it's all but gone now.

Edit: Also, to say they were 'top blokes' is wrong. A lot of these hooligans were Neo-Nazis, and were using football as a crude excuse for wanton violence and thuggery. Here's a story from wikipedia, I can't vouch for it's veracity and there's no citation but still sounds like something they might do:

Kevin Whitton, a high-profile member of the firm, was sentenced to life imprisonment on 8 November 1985 for violent assault after being found guilty of involvement in an attack on a pub on Kings Road, which was described as being some of the worst incidents of football hooliganism ever witnessed in England. After Chelsea lost a match, Whitton and other hooligans stormed into the pub, chanting ""War! War! War!"". When they left a few minutes later, with one of them shouting, ""You bloody Americans! Coming here taking our jobs"", the bar's American manager, 29-year-old Neil Hansen, was lying on the floor, close to death. Whitton's sentence was cut to three years on appeal on 19 May 1986.",0,1358009665,null,0,1358009926,0,c7vnapp,t3_16ewnh,t1_c7vnapp,t3_16ewnh,null,1435646063,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

I don't say it's *true* - I actually thing most firms are too disorganised / unmotivated to bother about undermining workers' solidarity - but the *effect* may be the same, whether it's intended or not. 

Getting jobs for one's family / mates, and ""perks"" (which incidentally comes from ""perquisites"" and is a very old concept) are historically significant, and whether they've been deliberately or co-incidentally eroded, I think contribute to a general anomie and failure to identify with one's company and profession.

true,notnotcitricsquid,cnty-uk,Stafford,"Slight tangent, but if you're young this might be worth reading.

I'd always thought ""pensions are for when you're old"" and ""I'm 20, why am I going to start a pension?"" then I looked at the figures and realised... holy fuck, if you don't start a pension young you're doing yourself a great disservice.

The difference between starting a pension at 20 and 30 is *huge*, it's not the difference between a few quid, it's the difference between a good and a bad pension. It's insane that we're not taught this in school, especially with how much the government needs people to be setting up their own pensions and how much they make it worth while. If I waited 10 years to start my pension (at 30) instead of when I did start it (20) it would be worth half the amount... half! 

If you have the chance to start a pension through your employer **take it** no matter how young you are. I'm very lucky and have a fantastic salary and pension matching scheme from my employer, it makes a negligible difference to my take home pay and if the investments go well it'll be worth a lot of money, enough to live a very nice retired life. 

Even if you only put £120 per month towards your pension you'll be almost doubling your take home compared to the state pension alone. 

If your employer offers a pension matching scheme, start a pension, seriously. Do it. If your employer doesn't then at the very least look into the figures relating to starting a pension now, it may still be worth it.

Really?

Am I just jaded, or am I one of the handful of people who watch him play.  The man holds up the ball, he looks for one twos and I feel that he helps us maintain possession by not always shooting or giving the ball up.

Sure, he is not finishing but either is Defoe, who coincidentally only gets praise, or Dempsey, who gets praise from americans and get shit on by the english fan base.  One of Ades best game for spurs, in my memory was last years victory over NC when he had five assists.  That is what Ade brings to the game, but if no one else is finishing, he is not racking up assists.

I'm not a fan boy of Adebayor by any stretch of the imagination, he just seems to get unnecessary slack for doing his job well.

We need a decision maker. The passing IS intelligent in my opinion. We need someone who can pick the right moment to exploit the weaknesses from the good passing.

This is a different kind of intelligence to the kinds of Dembele, who can use his passing and dribbling to create gaps, or Siggurdson who is able to play through balls even when the defence is well organised.

If you watch our attacks during today's game, you will see several instances of players being in good positions, but nobody has seen them, or been able to get the ball to them in time to exploit the gaps.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"We need a creative midfielder who can pass the ball forward FAR more than we need a striker right now. I didn't want to wake up today so I recorded and just got around to watching the match and our movement up front was actually acceptable--we just don't have anyone to pass the ball to people making good runs.

Crazily enough, Scott Parker was probably the only one from midfield who had the balls to try some incisive passes. 

I counted probably a dozen great runs from Bale and Lennon that were not picked out not because they weren't seen, but because the players on the ball don't have the confidence to play the pass.

I will harp this next point until I'm blue in the face: we are winning IN SPITE of 4-4-2, not because of it. Both strikers have been absolute shit in this formation for the better part of 2 months. Defoe's best run of goalscoring came when Ade wasn't in the team. Ade's best form with us has come when he's up front by himself. 

If we keep this 4-4-2 for some trickier games, we WILL start paying for it. It's appeased the Facebook fans but really, who gives a shit about them? 

We need Dempsey or Gylfi in the team. Both have been far better than either striker when they've had the chances lately, and both are capable of picking a pass. Gylfi can't even get a minute in his correct position and Dempsey is being held out of the team by a strike partnership that hasn't worked once. 

I can almost guarantee we'd get more out of either one of our strikers if they were played alone with Deuce or Gylfi off them. AVB hasn't tinkered much because we're getting results, but I hope he realizes the system isn't winning us points: the individual ability of the players is.

Also, in the same area there's [Castlelaw Fort](http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/penicuik/castlelaw/index.html) which has an old medieval looking earth house. 

There's also the cycle path which runs at the foot of Arthur's Seat.  It's called The Innocent Railway, and it's got some beautiful scenery.  There's also a very creepy tunnel.  Whilst there's a fairly constant steam of cyclists through here, it's never what you would describe as "" crowded"". 

There is also [Roslin Glen](http://www.midlothian.gov.uk/info/200144/roslin_glen_country_park) which is also home to Rosslyn Chapel and the ruins of the old castle.  There were a variety of scenes filmed here and used in The DaVinci Code.  Beautiful area.

[Penicuik House](http://www.penicuikhouse.co.uk/) also has a lot of beautiful landscape around it.  Again, there are still people who go to see it, but it isn't crowded. 

[Bonaly Outdoor Centre](http://www.bonaly.org.uk/) is a little place run by the Scouts.  They might be more than happy to let you use the area, and sometimes it can look really cool because they've built little campfires and improvised seats, and are cutting up wood etc.  Again, it looks very medieval in some ways, and having looked through your photography, I'd be surprised if you couldn't find inspiration.

I thought we played some nice football though. Started both halves very well and had a promising surge of energy at around 60 minutes. On another day, Adebayor scores the early chance, they come out to attack us and we dominate them.

Plenty of positives to take from the game, defence looked solid and we got another clean sheet. Dawson and Vertonghen partnership looks very good and I thought Dawson coped very well with some of their speedy players.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Well, I think it is dangerous in a society to not allow the state to offer that sort of protection to its most vulnerable members, as I said before - and I do believe you are misinformed about the harm it can do.

But I do understand the argument from it being important to cultures - I just don't think it's a good enough one to allow it to happen.

After all, cannibalism and human sacrifice, as well as forcibly marrying off daughters at 11, female genital mutilation, death penalty (particularly of those under 18), and all sorts of other shit have been culturally important and yet we've put a stop to it. Clearly we are quite okay with imposing ethics and morality and what have you on other cultures (even ones in countries that we don't even have jurisdiction over!!) - so I don't really find that argument satisfying either.

I'm not sure where you stand on any of the above issues, but I still hold that this one is only accepted because people don't see it as a problem like they do with the above. And as I said I put that down mostly to people not properly understanding the issue.

After all, cultural importance shouldn't give people a free pass to flout an ethically based system of law - this is why we don't let people import other important cultural barbarism into our legal framework, such as punishment by rape, and chopping off the hands of thieves. We, as a society, don't give a shit how culturally important some things are, clearly, but we seem happy to let this one issue slip regardless of how fundamentally wrong it is, and how much it disagrees with the very foundation of our legal system.

But okay - I suppose as long as you don't see this as an atrocious act carried out without consent against a vulnerable human being, you aren't likely to change your mind about it... if you see it as an insignificant act that will do no harm at all, then I can agree that we are likely to keep on disagreeing as long as you hold that view. But I would still hope that you can read more about this and change your mind about what it is that is actually being done.

You can read first hand accounts of lives ruined by this - it's all there at your fingertips. By ending the practise you can end countless more ruined lives, too. And I know you still seems to disagree that this has ruined anyone's life, but assuming you do go away now and read about a couple, or ten, twenty, or a hundred individual cases where this has happened... ask yourself if it's really worth giving protection to this practise that is nothing more than a tradition, if that is the result.

If you put yourself in the position of one of those people and just think how they must feel, and be asking themselves.. why.. why the hell would someone do something so pointless, harm them irrevocably in this way, all for the sake of a stupid tradition? These people rarely get an answer. It happens just because.

true,TheMemo,blue,The Gentleman,"Lack of choice in the long term - in the same way that we are, realistically, limited to three (well, now two) main political parties. 

Yes, chain stores are 'better' if you have lowest-common-denominator needs - food staples like bread, rice and things (as we all do) but that means that, in the end, you are limited to what a large chain will stock. A large chain has a top-down approach and does not account for much regional variation in wants or needs (from experience, less than 3% of store space can be used for things with demonstrable local demand). Therefore, the products that are available to buy are the products that each chain will allow you to purchase, rather than what each given community could really use. Personally, I like green tea Kit-Kats, for example, but they won't ever be available in any non-independent stores regardless of demand, because large chains and their distribution partners are the arbiters of any product's success. 

Furthermore, as noted in the video, chain stores do not purchase their produce and goods from local vendors, ensuring that there is a net loss to the local economy, compounded by the reduced wages chains offer in comparison to independent stores. This is not balanced by the reduced prices they can offer.

Ultimately, though, there is a confluence of issues - from the over-support of large chains from the government and local planners to the use of the internet to purchase less-popular goods. We have a severe issue where tax and business rates are lowered (or even absent) for large chains, which makes it difficult for small businesses to compete on an even playing field. 

If we were to look at somewhere like Singapore, we can see that large chains and small, independent stores live happily together in malls and streets. The reason for this is cultural - firstly, taxation and planning is equal for all types of business (and cheap), secondly, public transport is sufficient to ensure a 30-minute maximum journey and, thirdly, the range of products stocked by independent retailers (of which there are many) is so good that Singaporeans do not feel the need to order products on-line.

The fact that we still have business rates (and extortionate rents) for shops is ludicrous given that physical shops are no longer a necessity for purchasing goods. The result is that those companies that can avoid these taxes (through local government exceptions in exchange for 'creating employment' and tax-avoidance schemes) have an exceptional advantage on the high street.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"I was just thinking about making a very serious sounding topic titled, ""/r/leedsunited, let's talk about Warnock.""

For me, he's coming to the end of his tether. I'm not sure about sacking him (I think it's far more likely that he'll walk), but I certainly would not renew his contract at the end of the season.

Two things really worry me about him:

1. **He doesn't know his best XI.**

2. **He doesn't know his best formation.**

Most Leeds fans should have picked up on the first point by now. The only time he's had a consistent starting XI was in the winning streak that started with Crystal Palace at home and was ended by defeat to Derby away. It's no surprise that our best run of form coincided with our **only** period of consistency. After that, Warnock started chopping and changing it again.

As for the second point, well, we've seen a plethora of different formations at Elland Road this season. He started off playing 4-4-1-1 (think England at Euro 2012), first with McCormack coming into midfield to pick up the ball, then Diouf. After realising that Becchio was becoming increasingly isolated up front, he went to 4-4-2, trying to play Diouf as a traditional forward while McCormack was out injured. Then, at times, we've seen him try out 3-5-2, with an abject performance every single time it was used. Lately, we've even seen him trying out a 4-3-3 formation, first with McCormack out wide and now with Barkley.

While I think that a change of formation can be an ingenious managerial decision (Mancini changing Manchester City's formation to 3-5-2 by bringing Micah Richards on, while holding a lead, was instrumental in their title win), the frequency of Warnock's formation changes speaks of indecision to me. Worse: by matching Hull and Watford's own 3-5-2 formations, it said to them that ""we're not good enough to impose our own game onto you, so we'll just try to counter yours.""

What also concerns me is his business in both transfer windows. In fairness, you can't be too harsh on him in the summer because Bates was clearly the villain then - as he has been for a while. However, the overall picture is that we're signing aging players (Drury, Norris, Tonge, Green) in the twilight of their careers who we would have to shed if we **did** achieve promotion, but since they aren't even good enough to help us to that, they'll most likely still be on the club's wage bill after the manager who signed them finishes his year-long contract. I know that Warnock was going for the short-term - the here and now - to get us promotion ASAP, but not signing a midfielder who can pass the ball until the January transfer window is hardly the right way of going about it.

Finally, his baffling team selections are a source of worry. Why is Peltier in every single team, even when he's only half-fit? Why is he even **captain**? Why are Tate and Pearce, two players with little to no pace and agility (Marlon Harewood and Chris Dagnall were skipping past them for fun!), who Eddie Gray constantly said couldn't play together before it was even tried, constantly playing in a partnership at the heart of defence? Why has Tom Lees been dropped for so long when he's been our best defender since the Millwall game? Why was Barkley - a player who is naturally a central midfielder, and has only ever really played there before - starting on the wing for us today?

I can think of even more questions than that, but I won't go further because it will only make people more depressed. I haven't even touched on his dire brand of football, as well (which I must say is far from ""winning football"" - which would have made it bearable).

I like Warnock as a person, I really do, and I would have been so happy if Warnock got Leeds promoted in his final season as a football manager, or even stayed on a season after promotion to secure our place in the top tier. But it's just not going to work. The team is a mess and most of the players he's brought in are struggling to cut it and only going to get worse.

Edit: I also meant to say that I would be really, really interested to read who people think would be an ideal successor to the role of manager at Elland Road. Because, to be honest, I genuinely am struggling to think of any.

A work place pension is one ""owned"" by your employer but still *your* money, when you leave the company you can request they transfer the pension value to a personal pension or another work place pension.

The most important points are that every penny is yours, if your employer fires or you quit the money is still yours, they can't take it back no matter what percentage is your contributions or what contribution is the employers. You can have multiple pension accounts at once, every pension account has different charges and things associated with it, often an employer will offer you the best rates so it makes sense to consolidate your pensions with them.

Some people do take words at face value and because of the verbal abuse their life does suck.  Some people aren't as strong as others.  

By being so flippant about it, it's as if you're ignoring mental health issues that negative words they face every day can have on some people.

Apple juice made from scrumped apples is probably quite nice.  Cider made from scrumped apples, using a traditional process, is what we call scrumpy in Devon.  Scrumpy is strong but bad - the cider equilvent of picking up dog ends on the street and making cigarettes out of them - because traditional cider is brewed using the natural yeast of the apples and when you scrump apples from all quarters you end up with bad apple yeast that contaminates the brewing process.

This can be mitigated by introduing agents before fermentation (that kill all the natural yeasts) and then adding extra (non apple) yeast to start the fermentation process (this is non-traditional cider).  This makes quite a nice drink but to call it cider is a bit like calling grape juice mixed with vodka wine.  However, I'd still drink non-traditional cider over scrumpy any day!

To complicate matters further some companies now comercially sell cider under a generic *scrumpy brand* that 
means strong/traditional cider (but is not made with scrounged/scavenged apples using a traditional process).

I will admit a bias as I am a physicist, but one of my close mates is a zoologist. When you 'simplify' zoology you are never really lying about what you are saying. 

While you are obviously not giving the whole truth, you can give a recount which ignore complex ecology and biochemical signatures and still encapsulate a lot of what is going on. A slug mating ritual can intrigue a layman, an expert can talk about how they signal to one another and what lead to that mating technique.

To simplify physics you often really have to simplify the concepts. If you read Cox's books (which are usually co-authored) they are generally quite good at getting the concept without ignoring the maths to much, but his shows often gloss over the maths and physics that lead to said conclusion. There is a slight resentment in the science community over the idea that people who like 'science' actually like the conclusions, rather than the process.

I work in science outreach so I don't really have any resentment to this, I try and get people who wouldn't otherwise care about science to at least consider its value.

Another unfortunate incident befell me one night when I was on a bus back from a nightclub with a few friends. Gypsy boy jumped me from the seat behind. Couldn't just ask me for a fight. As he was laying into me, all the guys on the bus stood up and came to the back of the bus and started smashing his face to fucking pieces. Like little girls he and his friends jumped out of the emergency exit and legged it.

So yeah, suicide is bad and I wouldn't wish having to feel that way upon anybody. But hearing about gypsies committing suicide as opposed to non-gypsies? I don't give a fuck. I know people say ""don't tar them all with the same brush"" but I have met so many of them and they all act the same.

The argument that chains are 'better' is dubious in my opinion, because of multiple factors.

Since the 50s and 60s our urban design has shifted towards the car, and everything that goes with it. Design choices such as a suburban car-only residential areas (Emerson Green and Bradley Stoke are the best examples in Bristol) lead to supermarkets being the optimal choice. In areas where residential areas are made from dense terraces and 3-floor apartments, then high streets such as Gloucester Road can grow. 

The advantages these areas have are that while walking through an area (to work, school, etc.), it is viable to simply visit a shop briefly and pick up a few days worth of goods then return home. Weekly and fortnightly trips aren't practical, but daily trips are. This is a 'good thing', because mild exercise that is built into your day such as walking to work improves the health of the society no bound. This is related to independents, because in these densely populated environments competition between small convenience stores is viable (trunk walking routes could be home to half a dozen shops), but that category of store can't compete with the draw of larger supermarkets.

I'm terrible at conveying my thoughts on these as you can see, but the long-and-short is that the benefit of independent stores in dense areas is greater than the sum of the price of the goods being sold.

true,NumbNuttsGB,null,null,"Not in the traditional sense no but it does have three safety systems, what Glock call the ['safe action' system] (http://us.glock.com/technology/safe-action)

The browning for example has only a switch - when it is activated you cant pull the trigger (as in it is physically locked in place) however if for example the hammer is cocked with the safety on there is nothing to stop a very hard knock on the hammer from forcing it to disconnect from the sear and fire the round even though the trigger was never touched (unlikely but possible) - some variants do however have a firing pin block that blocks the hammer until the trigger is touched.

The Glock has no external switch however it does have 3 safety systems. The first being a [lever on the trigger itself](http://imgur.com/RARBW), in order for the trigger to move you have to both hold the trigger and the lever back at the same time - this stops the trigger being pulled if for example it gets caught on clothing or a holster.

The second safety is a pin the physically stops the firing pin (called a striker in a Glock) from being able to fly forward and contact the primer on the round - in other words if you drop the gun it wont go off as the firing pin can never contact the round.

The third safety is an additional physical contact between the trigger connector and the firing pin, in order for the firing pin to move from the cocked position the trigger MUST be pulled to the rear.

Some don't like the lack of a manual safety lever and just don't trust the more subtle safety systems like the Glocks as they see it as the removal of another safety step however i have no issues with it and i regularly shoot my Glock 17 from holsters during IPSC shooting matches.

true,MooMorris,null,null,"I think a couple of the points are fairly clear cut for what he may give as an answer. He justifies putting drugs into his body because he wasn't good enough without it. Cancer treatment kicks 7 shades of shit out of a person, and his body wasn't going to allow him to become a world champion (it's debatable as to whether he was good enough before before).

An athlete has to be competitive, and an international athlete takes this to the extreme- you see only the route to victory. Every freezing morning, every drop of sweat, every time you collapse from exhaustion; it's all aimed at winning. The desire to win takes over your life, it's more than an obsession. The guys who cheat are the guys who are either unwilling to put the thousands of hours in or who just aren't good enough legitimately.

During his treatment, Lance did what the docs said and took it to the extreme- e.g. told to drink two glasses of water a day, he drank 7. He maintains his desire to be the best, but his body is a wreck, and he's training like mad but can't get good enough. My theory is that he took something to help get him to the minimum international standard. He's with a team and the amount of support for drugs opens up. He wins 1999 TdF, but not against the big names. He's now 'immortalised' as the man who went from advanced cancer to winning one of the toughest endurance competition- he's a hero and, importantly, is a major cash maker.

So his first win has achieved his personal (winning) and his sponsors/ team's (financial) goals, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it. It continues, and any guilt he may have is nullified by the team management having him over a barrel- if he stops but doesn't admit, then the team will reveal all, and he'll be completely ruined. 

I think this could also provide an answer re. lying to the cancer community. He's a beacon of hope for sufferers, and by putting his name to charities he's helping people, raising millions and almost certainly saving lives. He's done it immorally, but lives are saved and fortunately it's unlikely cancer will be viewed in lesser regard.",0,1358026037,null,0,false,0,c7vrk0u,t3_16g5m2,t1_c7vrk0u,t3_16g5m2,null,1430939996,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"First of all a caveat- I'm a pensions admin for the NHS Scheme, so if you want precise, current accurate advise you'll need to speak to a financial Adviser.

That said, I can offer some guidance. First of all, start paying into a pension ASAP. You can often transfer your pension between providers, so even if you're not planning on paying into a scheme indefinitely, pay into one anyway. You can transfer it into a new scheme further down the line.

Second later this year employers will be required to offer their employees (with some exceptions) a pension scheme (details here: http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/future-pension-reforms/automatic-enrolment) Part of this new law also requires that employers contribute towards the scheme also, but the minimum is just under half of what you'd contribute. Nevertheless, you'll get tax relief on your contributions and a second stream of income into your pension pot, making it a good starting point.

Also bear in mind that this is the minimum required- some employers may  offer you more. If you are, or get to a point in your career where you can dictate terms of employment, a preferential rate of pension contribution might be worth asking.

Many employers offer opportunities to increase your pension contributions or purchase additional pension. It's worth looking into this but be warned that they are often very expensive and the employer doesn't need (and often won't) contribute more in line with your increased contributions. The current scheme in place for the NHS Pension has a 'profit margin' of about 14 -17 years- meaning you need to be drawing on that pension for 14-17 years before you're making back any money!

That's the other important element. Your pension scheme needs to end up paying you back more than you've paid in- or else you're better off just sticking your money in a high interest bank account.

It's hard to say what exactly you should do and shouldn't, but enrolling with an employer pension scheme is an excellent start. Just make sure that you read the literature they offer you carefully, and speak with one of their pension administrators if there's anything you don't understand. I get at least four calls a week from people who don't understand *any* of the pension scheme's rules, and I'd rather a hundred of those calls than one call from someone who has shot themselves in the foot.

So the long and short of it is to enroll in your employer pension scheme as a start, read up on how the scheme operates, look into the possibility of buying above the basic rate of pension (morbid hint, if your family tend to die young then it's probably not worth it) and also request a statement about your pension every year, assuming the company doesn't provide one.

Edit:

Bonds and stock can work, but honestly I think they're usually best reserved for people who need to avoid paying into their pension so they don't hit their life time allowance, which is quite hard unless you're earning very big money. We're talking consultant money here. Some options can also offer a better return than additional pension schemes or extra contributions. The base line is still the same though- pay into an employer scheme as a good start and then you can begin looking at ways to boost your potential income.",0,1358028758,null,0,false,0,c7vsc8b,t3_16fx4c,t1_c7vsc8b,t1_c7vqzvd,null,1430940367,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If you are serious in the opinion presented here then: ask me how I know you're a man.

That's assuming you're not trying to get a rise out of people, of course. If that's the case: What's the matter, why are you angry? Why do you feel the need to upset, or try to upset, other people?

I'm a man too, btw, but I don't automatically assume she's lying. That's mainly because I've read about, spoken to and listened to women (and men) who've been assaulted, as well as thought about the issue long enough to realise there's generally no reason for someone to make up stuff like this. *Particularly* not an a semi-anonymous blog.

Do you think women make stuff like this up as a matter of course? If yes, why would they do that? Do you think people don't get assaulted on crowded trains, or anywhere?

You might have heard about what Jimmy Saville did over the course of about 50 years. Do you know how many people have only just come forward, who didn't say anything at the time? Granted it's slightly different given his fame in the UK, but we could still pose a variation of the question you did. Go to [any thread here on reddit that brings up sexual assault](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16dlvk/what_secret_are_you_keeping_that_is_ruining_your/) and people will come forward with a story they've never told anyone about before. But no-one would keep that to themselves, surely?

Why would someone freeze up and not shout? Maybe like when someone sees a lorry thundering towards them. No way would someone just stand and gawp and get hit by it! No way they'd stare ""deer in the headlights"" and get hit by it, that never happens!

If you don't take it as impertinent, I really would advise having a think about why you'd automatically assume people would lie about something like this, as well as considering the phrase ""Walk a mile in someone else's shoes.""

Sure, there are *plenty* of callbacks to the classic series, especially once Moffat's run comes along.

I think you keep latching onto these characters because they're what you know, but you fail to realize how much of the same kind of narrative, if not more so, people miss by not watching the old series.

For example, we've seen both The Master as well as Davros, yet I don't see you arguing that one must watch through their entire narrative story in order to appreciate their appearances in the RTD era. Or how about Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart? His death was integral in The Wedding of River Song, yet the death doesn't mean nearly as much for the viewer without witnessing the relationship between him and The Doctor. Same could even be said for the Brigadier's daughter. You don't know fully why The Doctor attaches himself to her the way he does without knowing the full backstory.

However, witnessing these things or not does not impede on the current narrative being told. While the death of Lethbridge-Stewart is touching on an entirely different level if you've watched a lot of classic Who, you can still understand that this is someone who was important to The Doctor given the context of the scene. Or how about Sarah Jane Smith? Same things can be said about her and her appearance during the RTD era.

Not watching every episode involving these characters does not impede on the narrative being said. If it did, there would have been a lot more confusion when The Master, Davros, K-9/Sarah Jane, et al showed up, but there wasn't. Truth is that the narrative can be successfully told, and is successfully told, without the viewer knowing the entirety of a character's back story. And, despite me not mentioning it until now, that includes The Doctor. I don't understand how you seem to think all these little characters matter so much that one should watch the entirety of David Tennant's run just to see River Song, but then ignore the character that the show is based on.

On a train the idea wouldn't be to start fighting the attacker but to be loud and confident and create distance, whilst having the confidence to defend yourself as a last resort.

Obviously women shouldn't have to learn to defend themselves from men, and realistically for most women there will never be the need to, but if someone is worried about this learning a self defence system such as Krav Maga will boost confidence tremendously.

Reading all these comments, they're both kind of right-on and kind of missing it. I think his facial features strike a pretty good resemblance. I don't think his nose is necessarily 'too big'. I think it's that his facial features are too large _in comparison to the rest of his skull_. This is actually the same thing I tended to do in my sculptures, which was shortchange the skull. He needs a lot more cranium coming off the back of his head. Fill it out a bit more and his face will probably look more natural. 

Some parts could stand to be emphasized or de-emphasized. Emphasize his ears. Check them out, they stand out from his head a little off the sides (bless): http://i.imgur.com/qCE4g.gif http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltlpmevKX61qa6s1b.gif

true,Gettingworst,num26,,"IMO, today's match highlighted the lack of a creative midfield to unlock defence. Bale and Lennon needs to be more disciplined and stay wide instead of cutting in especially when the middle is so full of traffic, it was futile trying to cut inside and go through the whole QPR team. Maybe Bennie's absence restricted our width when pressing forward so Bale took it upon himself to cut in to get more action. 

One thing I don't agree with is our lack of a striker, this match would have been better off just playing 1 striker up top especially when teams are parking the bus in front of goals, the best way to go through them is to spread the ball wide to stretch them and a late run from midfield to finish off things. I would have played either Defoe or Ade up top with Siggy or Dempsey playing behind them today knowing that's how QPR played against Chelsea the other night and you know Harry just wanted to keep things tight and maybe nick a goal on the break like they did against the pensioners. Funny how no one cared about QPR getting all their men behind the ball when they played Chelsea but moaned about the QPR tactics today when it was more of the same in both matches.

We go to the football too but that peculiar ""we're the best at this, we are"" kind of feeling? Not so much!

I can't remember exactly but I think there was a specific reason why the Ulster Banner background is white not yellow and I don't think it was due to the English flag. Nationalists might not like the crown but unionists seem to accept the red hand, probably the most Gaelic of any Ulster symbolism. The star is meaningful without being directly partisan, unless you listen to the sort of people who say things like 'six counties, partitionist' etc who of course won't be supporting any NI flag ever.

Perhaps a change to the flag of St Patrick for the background would maybe do something?

Davros was explained fine in the Season 4 finale. He explained that he created a new race of Daleks from pieces of himself. On top of the fact that the Doctor had dealt with him before, that's all you needed. Same goes for The Master, he was an evil time lord that landed at the end of the universe after the time war, that's all you really need. I'm almost with you on Sarah Jane actually, but with her and K-9 it's merely a matter of 'these are a couple old companions'. If you watch school Reunion out of context, you can easily presume that her and The Doctor went through a lot together based on how they act and SJ's interaction with Rose. Frankly I thought the Brigadier's death was forced, unnecessary, and done way too much in passing. I don't think it should've been done the way it was at all, but that's a different debate. I can't say for his daughter because we've barely seen her, and her episode was the shittiest of Moffat's entire run in my opinion.

It's completely different with River and The Doctor. For River, knowing that she is *already dead* in The Doctor's timeline is a key piece of information that you won't get from anywhere but the RTD era. In the case of The doctor, he is a completely different character in the reboot. I don't mean that in the regeneration sense. Doctors One through Eight are a totally different guy than Doctors Nine through Eleven because of the Time War. The Time War has completely fucked him up beyond all belief, and he just now started getting over it. He loses his shit and goes manically depressed whenever companions leave now, which is a pretty stark contrast to back when he would react by [instantly replacing them and grinning at the camera](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlGlCW9uQc). Basically, the classic series is a whole different ball game and doesn't play by the same rules. Could you even fathom a classic Doctor in a scene like Ten's regeneration? I certainly couldn't. That ""I don't wanna go"" is so outrageously out of character for The Doctor as a whole (factoring 1-11) that it isn't even funny, but it fit the modern series just fine because it's a completely different era in quite literally every possible aspect. The same kind of thing happens between Two and Three. The show and character take a completely different turn to the point where you can almost make just as hard of a division there as you can between Eight and Nine.

Got this guy who was obviously trying to get sales in because I said I only needed it for 6 months and asked what he could do... He suggested an 18 month contract which cost £20 a month. I explained that I wasn't going to pay an unnecessary £240 on the year I wasn't using it and that I was looking at their website and it had a rolling month contract for the same price I'm paying now and more data... He tried to give me a 12 month contact costing £17. I tried explaining that the deals on the website were better for me and he kept ignoring it and telling me how super fast this internet dongle was or how much data I could get on that plan.

Eventually I said that the deals he was offering weren't going to work for me and I was going to hang up. He said ""Okay, you go look elsewhere and then I'll phone you back"", so I told him very clearly not to phone me back as I was going to stick with my current contract. Thanked him and hung up.

An hour later he phoned back, as soon as he said ""Hello, I'm phoning back from 3"", I said ""I asked you not to phone back, if you phone back I will be filing a complaint with 3 saying you are harassing me. Please do not call again. Good bye."" and hung up. 

Super unimpressed. Will be going into a store to get the rolling one month contract sorted, then canceling as soon as I don't need it. They do have some of the best data plans but I really dislike how they work.

They also charged me £30 once because they hadn't capped my data when they said they had, so I left a load of podcasts downloading and it went over instead of stopping, and they said ""Oh, our bad but you still have to pay"".

That's not what I'm suggesting. I'm saying issue basic guidelines that if a subject's been done to death with inane single issue memes (and yeah, at times just base sectarianism) then these submissions will be deleted. This ensures the crap is minimised to a few relevant topics and stops /r/northernireland from looking like the same knuckledragging backwater it's denizens are regularly accusing others of being. There are plenty of subreddits out there that clamp down on idiotic macros - it's standard practice. And I'm suggesting that when 80% of a frontpage is filled with a single issue consistently then that's a good measure that things are OTT.

I actually heard the opposite.

I'm aware of all that. That's why I analysed what was actually on the Banner piece by piece. Like the Tricolour and Union flag, it's not liked by a specific side not because of it's symbols but because of what it represents. Given that, I'm unsure how nationalists will ever be confident enough to give their blessing to *any* NI flag.

Disagree, it's not the result if it wasn't the intention. People being misinformed should be a reason to inform rather than merely let ignorance remain.

&gt;The reported post I see from you are typically just insulting you personally

Well that's alright then! Nothing to see here!

&gt;rather than insulting loyalists in general

Then can I suggest reading my reports more carefully? Off the top of my head, a redditor claiming he couldn't wait 'until you all die out'? Or was that ok because they included me in on the hate?

From /r/northernireland sidebar:

&gt;Asking for anyone's religious/political beliefs is fine. Disrespecting them is not!

You view redditors turning the air blue when they just can't tolerate a *few* differing opinions yet you're at pains to point out my apparent faults, none of which have ever included insulting one of them with crass language. And then claim they're not disrespecting my beliefs! The free rein the mods give the cybernats on this sub is exactly the reason it's so one-sided. But hey, close your eyes and put your hands over your ears and all's actually fine.

&gt;which is reasonable to me considering the topic keeps escalating and more things keep happening

Escalating? Sorry I've obviously missed that. The only escalating happening is inside people's heads. For a large percentage of them, because they want it to. And the result?
