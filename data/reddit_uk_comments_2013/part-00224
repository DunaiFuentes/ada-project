Obviously the likes of Suso, Sterling and Ibe are getting games at the top level with Suso really staring at youth international level and in La Liga. After that there are quite a few big talents in our u21 squad with Yesil, Teixeira, Morgan, McLaughlin all look like they could potentially make it to the first team. Ilori just signed as well is only 20 currently and wisdom on loan is 20 as well. Would love to see Lloyd Jones, Jack Robinson or Conor Coady make it but I think they are a slight notch behind those above. Certainly one of the more impressive out of all is Rossiter starting every game for u21 being 16. In terms of our u18 we have a lot there as well, youngest ever red Sinclair, youngest ever wales player Wilson, Ryan Kent, Sheyi Ojo are all dominating at their levels right now especially Wilson and Kent tearing it up on the wings. Not to mention the two Spaniards from Barca and Valencia! They are very highly rated and I can't wait to see them suit up for us. 

out of all I would hope to say Canos has the most promise coming from La Mestalla but without having seen him and him being so young I would say a tie for me between Suso and Rossiter with Ibe a close 3rd.

true,[deleted],null,null,"In my experience the apparent decline in popularity of Guy Fawkes night can be put down to two mains areas.

Firstly, the apparent removal of organisation away from individuals and on to local councils due to either funding or safety reasons. Growing up in Kent I recall our local bonfire would be organised by locals, perhaps in association with a parish or local club (football, rugby etc), but ultimately by the people. However, the trend these days appears to be that events are almost exclusively organised by local councils, which instantly changes the event. Whilst it shouldn't make a difference the the health &amp; safety steps taken by councils, and honestly I couldn't tell you how they've done it, but seems to take away from the event. Hell, last one I went to in Leeds I can barely even remembering making within sight of a bonfire, and yet I could see lots of funfair rides etc.

Secondly, and as a result of the above I've noticed a trend that bonfires will often not take place on 5th November. It seems that many worry about the profitability of their event, and so choose to move their celebrations from a Tuesday to the proceeding or following Saturday. This year that could mean the 2nd November, which is dangerously close to Halloween. By failing to keep to tradition and keeping the event on the correct day it damages the event.

People get them because they are cheap but in the end you will likely end up spending more on them keeping them running.

This is very general though I'm sure there are some models going about that don't have these issues.  If you do go for one as I say just make sure and research the model thoroughly and know what you are getting into.

Onyewu was such a dominant defender when he was playing at Standard Liege, was drawing plenty of comparisons to Kompany who had previously been the best center back in the league. Ended up having a failed loan to Newcastle, made the move to AC Milan, and has been injured ever since, featuring sporadically for clubs like Sporting Lisbon &amp; Malaga but never in a starting capacity. 

When healthy, Onyewu is a dominant physical presence that could really abuse a lot of the more direct Championship teams and shut them down - but it's unclear if there's been much of a spell since that AC Milan injury where he has been that healthy.

My guess is QPR see this move as a gamble - he probably comes cheap, is a good squad player who can perform well in spots, and there's a chance that if given the right environment to train, he could be playing like the elite centerback he once was... but that is something of a pipe dream, even for USA supporters.",0,1382613501,null,0,false,0,ccyk2rl,t3_1p1g3v,t1_ccyk2rl,t1_ccy684r,null,1429002349,1,false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,1

From: http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-diseases/a-z/bovine-tb/badgers/culling/

What is the evidence for allowing culling of badgers in pilot areas?
The Defra badger cull policy is based on scientific evidence from the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). Using the results of this trial (based on an average of 5 years’ culling plus a 4-year post-cull period); culling over an area of 150km2 could be expected to lead to an average 16% reduction in TB incidence in the local area. This figure was agreed by an independent panel of scientists at a meeting with Professor Bob Watson, then Defra’s Chief Scientific Adviser.

Summary of key conclusions from this meeting
Chief Scientist Ian Boyd and Chief Vet Nigel Gibbens explain the science behind the badger cull (Guardian)
Randomised Badger Culling Trial
The results from the proactive culls in the RBCT suggest that the benefits of culling, ie reductions in incidence of TB in cattle in the culled area, may not be seen for 3-4 years after culling begins but could continue for at least 6 years after culling stops.

After that there were further Acts tightening up gun control following 3 high-profile mass shootings, at Hungerford, Cumbria and Dunblane.

So a large part of the shock following Dunblane was because people had belived that sufficient controls were already in place to prevent the sort of tragedy that had happened in Hungerford.

Third party liability insurance cover will only pay out to a third party if the insured person has been negligent. 

Another example of this is with car insurance and car fires. If someone sets my car on fire in a car park and it destroys your car because you have parked next to me you have to make a claim on your own insurance. I have not been negligent and my insurers are not obliged to indemnify you.

The name derives from the old English for the month it was held ( Ēostur-monath ) which was named after the goddess but who was not actively worshipped when the celebration became Ēostur/Easter.

For further evidence (of lack of pagan origin), you just have to look at the origins of the word used for Easter in Languages outside of English which are generally derived from the latin or hebrew for passover or have more generic meanings like resurrection or great feast.

As for Easter Bunnies, the earliest source for them is in the late 1600's in Germany where they were part of the Easter celebrations. That was long after paganism went out of fashion. There's no evidence of a link between the Easter bunny, painted eggs and paganism (outside of coincidences of these symbols occuring in other religions which is to be expected considering how common both rabbits and eggs are).

How about we make his life more tricky, go-on kick him in the shins, it's revolution, ITS FUN RITE? WE'RE CHANGING LOTS OF THINGS REALLY QUICKLY BECAUSE ITS A GOOD IDEA.

Oh shit... what I forgot is how the banking sector props up a large quantity of our shitty economy (is it 30% or something that silly? I forget.....) so now our tax revenues are down.... borrowing up or cut public service? Which shall we do?

Might I also ask you about how our allies (Europe/US) will react if we go off the deep end? Its not even 50 years since the Tory's/Yanks considered a military coup against a Labour leader. Not only would it fuck up old people but make our country vulnerable to counter-revolt.

* Reset jerry-mandering through rewriting constituent lines using a psuedo-random generator.
* Consider abolishing or somehow reducing the power of political parties the main aim here is to reduce the power of the fucking whip (fuck horse trading).

Well it pretty much *is* subjective.  Something that would put me on my arse might be just a niggle to you and vice-versa.  From my experiences of ATOS medicals it seems that some assessors assume that if someone is taking a high dose of painkillers then they must be effective and can therefore function normally, whereas others assume that they can't.  And sometimes the drugs can cause worse side effects than the actual condition; Drug A masks the pain but causes loss of motor control, or extreme nausea etc.

I'm not sure there is a real answer, if the rules are relaxed there's a chance that people will take the piss, if they are tightened people who genuinely need help are cut off from support.

All major nations need to agree some kind of minimum level of taxation and, more importantly, a principle that everyone should pay taxes somewhere.

Only then can they agree to prohibit the transfer of money to tax havens.

Modern economists seem to reject capital controls, whereby you face a big tax on taking your wealthy out of the country, because it prevents foreign investment.

If major nations were all party to ""group"" capital controls, then you could still take your millions and move to America or Australia with it, or make investments in those countries, without penalty. But you couldn't circumvent the transfer restrictions by wiring your cash to Antigua via a 3rd country.

I'm totally willing to recognise my lack of expertise in this area, so would be glad to learn from anyone who can point out the flaws in my reasoning without being a jerk. 

Right now there's basically nothing we can do to stop rich people taking their money and running (without paying their fair share) without expelling ourselves from the global community of countries which invest in each other.

I'm also interested in addressing the problem of subsidiary companies buying stuff, particularly intellectual property, from their own corporate owners abroad.

If I'm a mechanic then I'm allowed to ""write off"" the price of the oil and spanners that I buy as a cost of doing business. If I work on someone's car and charge them £100, then I deduct the £10 price of the oil, the £10 cost of workshop rent and £1 towards the cost of tools, and I'm only taxed on £79.

The taxman would not tolerate it if my mum or my wife started going down to Halfords, buying oil for £10 per litre and selling it to me for £50 a litre, in order to spread our tax liability. We would be convicted of fraud. 

Why then is Starbucks in Seattle allowed to dictate the licensing cost of the Starbucks logo to Starbucks UK, in order to spread their tax liability? The tax man should be treating these two companies as ""family"" - sure, you can give that money to your mum, but you're going to pay tax on it.

I almost feel like the directors of Starbucks UK should be able to say to Starbucks USA, ""sorry, we can't afford £100,000 per store in franchising fees any more, Costa have offered us a 10 year deal at £80,000 per store, and we're going to be rebranding every Starbucks in the country.

Paxman is, without doubt a ruthless questioner, but I don't feel his interntions are to show up his guests. He will challenge and question ruthlessly, but this is not to form an intellectual battle between himself and his guest (note: guest, not opponent), but to give them an arena to present their argument in the most conclusive way possible. Just because it seems like a battle when a guest is unable to stand up to questioning, it does not mean this is the journalistic intention Paxman started out with. 

Whilst most interviewers would have been happy with the weak content that Brand was offering up early on, Paxman pushed him for solid answers. This gave Brand the opportunity to truly flesh out his opinions and prove that he does know what he is talking about, and I am sure both Paxman and Brand went home delighted with how it went, because the viewer got the clearest view into the topic of discussion as possible.

Many of countries have communities that are so widely and roundly reviled, the prejudice is so ingrained in the wider population, that dissenting voices are rarely even heard. Very few will even accept that they are being prejudiced, because they feel so justified in their beliefs. It becomes an echo chamber of hatred, where anyone who is challenged on their beliefs can usually rattle off endless anecdotes about all the awful things the community does, how their lifestyle is somehow inherently immoral, how it is only sustainable at the expense of wider, normal society.

That's because none of us can predict the future.

If we look at history then rising wealth inequality (not to mention falling social mobility) would seem to make civil unrest inevitable.

That's what's always happened in the past, and that's the background to many historical revolutions.

The trend of rising wealth inequality combined with falling social mobility is now established over about 3 decades.

That's what's happened in this country - poor people have got poorer (relatively, which is what's important), rich people have got richer, and fewer kids born on council estates have become successful. 

These statements are based on measurable and provable metrics - they're not just my opinion. If you're a kid whose parents were poor and you're now doing well for yourself, then I'm pleased for you, but you're the exception.

I doubt if it's possible to predict whether serious disturbance in the status quo will happen in the next 5 years or the next 20. 

I personally think that another two decades of rising inequality will be enough to cause a crisis.

That's just my gut feeling, and it may not be a *rioting in the streets, hang all the politicians* kind of crisis, it may just be a major turn in our social narrative  about what is ""fair"", a wider belief that ""those rich bastards should pay more taxes"" and the political establishment embracing an belief system which emphasises social equality. 

No-one has all the answers. It may surprise some of the readers of this subreddit to hear that I don't have all the answers, and would guess that Brand would say the same thing of himself. Brand is paid to write for a magazine which publishes articles on political and social subjects, he's not supposed to have all the answers right now, and it's not his job to agree with you, either.

When a team ""parks the bus"" they effectively play 4 centre backs with the wide midfielders as full backs. That's the extreme end of sacrificing midfield control for defensive security.

We've conceded two open play goals since we switched formation, both from very long shots, at least one of which was a goalkeeping mistake. The three at the back means teams *can* get between our defense and midfield, but if they do they still have a lot of work to do to get in behind that defence, as one defender can come out to press and the other two cover passing angles. Whereas getting between our midfield and defence against two centre halves is much more threatening.

If you play a dedicated deep midfielder along with a back three you don't have enough presence higher up the field to press, its just a numbers thing. And if you can't press you have to sit deep.

true,BowesKnows,null,null,"""I am angry, we need a revolution,""

These were the words shouted by Russell Brand during his Newsnight interview by Russell Brand and they'd be more typical of the script of 'Braveheart 2' than any recent political debate but isn't this what political debate should be? It's exactly what this country needs. A call to arms, a call to wake the fuck up.

I actually thought Brand struggled through the first half of his Newsnight interview, he seemed to be coming up short on a lot of Paxman's difficult questions (though Paxman himself, for somebody so enamoured with their own importance, offered nothing of note on anything, as usual.) I thought Brand faltered midway through a couple of responses and was looking a little shaky in the face of this humour-free, impassive questioning. Then however, something magical happened, Paxman pissed Brand off. Paxman was playing his usual part of taking himself too seriously and a definite change could be seen in Russell's face with the realisation that Paxman was merely promoting the sort of hierarchy he was arguing against. Then he woke up and got worked up and launched into his impassioned speech on what needed to change and why, and it was excellent; well thought out, well researched, personal (to Paxman at least) and thoroughly thought provoking.

This is typical of Brand's television appearances, a man who is, after all is said and done, a comedian. He often begins with a silly, joking demeanour that can be mistaken for not taking the subject matter too seriously. I often hear Brand detractors referencing his tendency to mention his drug addiction. I would argue that this is something that makes him who he is, why wouldn't he mention it? It's much better than us finding out Cameron once had a whiff of a spliff when he was at uni and it being another pseudo-scandal. Speaking of which, the other anti-Brand argument is that the Andrew Sachs scandal proves that Brand's rhetoric is just another form of self-publicity.

What utter nonsense. I listened to that Sachs thing the week the podcast came out, (I await the inevitable accusation of being a Brand RA-RA) and nobody batted an eyelid; it was two weeks later that the whole furore started up because somebody from the Daily Mail finally caught wind of it. Completely ridiculous and exactly the kind of lazy, sensationalist 'journalism' that allows these real crimes to be swept under the carpet and go on largely ignored. The week the country was swept up in a fortnight old telephone call, the government under investigation by the EU for 'irregularities' in the award of funding for regional growth projects, remember? No? Exactly. What you remember is that Russell Brand made an evil, vile attack on a national treasure. Shame! Shame on Russell Brand! Direct all your hate at Russell Brand!

So why shouldn't we take this man's views seriously? They pull at the core of everything it is to be human. Why should we be dictated to by archaic monolithic structures that pander to the needs of corporations and toss the people the scraps in the form of hush-money shares from the sale of the Royal Mail? Why should we be told what we can and can't consume? Why should it be dictated to us how much we can and can't drink? Why should we pay massive taxes for systems that are broken whilst multi-billion pound companies pay none? And why would we pour our already stretched resources into criminalising drug-addicts rather than doing the human thing and helping them? One of those former drug-addicts, might be just who we need lead this country out of the pit of corruption it's drowning in. I don't mean the former druggy with a perfectly tailored suit and a private education, I mean one with fabulous hair and silly jeans who grew up like you and me, in the real world, with real problems and a growing sense that something needs to change and that thing is the current system of governance. It doesn't matter who you vote for, the government always gets in.

Opening goal against Crystal Palace doesn't happen without his ball carrying (no one else available in our squad can do this).

Second goal against Newcastle is set up by interplay with Suarez.

People criticise his performances by saying he's not a number 10. He isn't, true, but teams don't necessarily need a number 10, especially with two strikers who are ""9.5s"" (thanks Brendan).

1) Brand is fucking charismatic, don't get me wrong, but he isn't giving us proposing anything new. Actually, it's not that it's nothing new, more that he's simply giving us nothing to go on. The history of socialism is incredibly interesting: from the Utopian Socialists and the anarchists, to Marx and Marxism, to Leninism and Stalinism, and then to modern Socialism, the Labour party, New Labour... My point being: Socialism has generally been in decline. It also demonstrates a clear move away from 'revolutionary Socialism' towards 'Gradualism'. But maybe that trend can be reversed? Who knows. I'm happy to be convinced! But Brand offers us no reason to think so. He is just saying 'there will be a revolution!' Why? How do we know? What kind of revolution - Popular, Bolshevik? This is just his conviction talking. And because he is a persuasive speaker, it sounds good. But there's nothing *there*.

2) Rhetorically, anybody can do this. Anybody can make a list of bad things happening in the world. Or things they don't like about out political and social situation. Ironically, if you listen to politicians' speeches, often they do exactly the same thing. Define a problem, or better yet, a whole string of problems, then what you propose sounds better than the alternative. Nevertheless, I agree with Brand about some of these problems. But that doesn't get us anywhere. He isn't suggesting anything. He isn't posing anything.

The media still rants on and on about the Winter of Discontent, factitious industrial relations and so on, but that was so much less harmful to most people's interests than what is happening today.

So what you're saying is that we need to find a way of gaining status that isn't related to material wealth? Impossible!

Actually, while it's pretty common for people to protest and say that such a thing is impossible, Reddit's karma system seems to offer a suitably worthless incentive in exchange for people voluntarily generating vast amounts of value by commenting. If you ask me, people are mostly just so entrenched in the current money-in-exchange-for-job way of thinking that they just can't imagine things being any different. Most people, I'm sure, probably don't enjoy the current system very much, but they aren't sufficiently convinced that an alternative is even possible.

If we take the karma example further, we can see that while it's pretty easy to exploit, with all the novelty accounts and pun threads and so on, it ultimately doesn't gain anyone anything of value. As a status-giving system, it's great. But what would happen if karma were transferrable? It would suddenly gain actual value as a currency, and we'd be right back to the current problem.

I'm not suggesting we replace money with karma, but if we were looking for a system to replace our current one we could do worse than look at  Reddit's system and get some inspiration from it.",0,1382628360,null,0,false,0,ccyo3x5,t3_1p2zb1,t1_ccyo3x5,t1_ccyimqy,null,1429000468,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Also, the final against Stuttgart and the Super Cup against Real Madrid which we won. I was in Spain for that one with a Chelsea top. Was awkward, in Leon at the time and I remember getting funny looks from people. I cried.

Strangely enough my most vivid early memories were the two games against Tromso in the Cup Winners Cup.. Remember at the time we lost, and there was an ABSOLUTE fuck ton of snow. Watched that game since, was mad. Link for curious, only a minute long http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyQNKTJDVs4
Then we won the 2nd leg 7-1. That was my first ever game, went with my Dad. Some guy standing next to us called me a lucky charm apparently.

I think that same season I had a chance to go to the training ground. May have been a season before. Can't remember a lot but I've got a few pictures with some players, I've framed my picture with Di Matteo haha, can take a picture if people care enough. I remember meeting Di Matteo/Zola and Vialli (I think), all were as nice as you'd expect. I THINK Terry waved at me (Was rather young so I'm unsure.

Any further votes get transferred to the second choice candidate on the ballot. The question I have is, how do they decide who's vote gets transferred?  
  
An example scenario would be that Party A has 25,999 votes in the bank, and the next two ballots are counted. Both list Party A as their preferred #1 choice. However, one ballot chooses Party B as it's second choice, and the other ballot picks Party C as it's second choice. Only one of these ballots gets counted towards Party A's quota of 26,000, and the other will get transferred. But who decides which ballot is transferred? The choice has an implication for which of Party B or Party C will benefit from the transferred vote.

That sounds good in theory, but if you've ever been the victim of police injustice (me - not really - but my grandfather certainly was, repeatedly) you may find that just doesn't work in practice.

For example, the first thing the IPCC will do is try to convince you to accept a ""quick resolution"" where the police judge themselves. They don't tell you that if you accept that, you can't change your mind later.

Of course there's always a private prosecution, if you can find a solicitor who'll take it on. That mostly means one of a few firms with specialists, which makes things impractical.

Not a problem if you can afford a barrister, of course.

true,NesquikMike,null,null,"&gt;My point was why was this the case? If left wing ideas are presented neutrally, the majority of the country agrees with them, the reality is, that they never are presented neutrally. They're presented with a hugely prejudicial context.

I don't know if the majority of the country would agree with them, but I'll leave that as I can't really argue that they wouldn't. However, yes left wing arguments can be presented badly such as by the Daily Mail, but so can right wing ideas by The Guardian or the Independent. Also in the reverse left and right wing publications also make their ideology look appealing through rhetoric, both sides are guilty of framing debates. 

&gt;Depends on the revolution proposed and the surrounding economic circumstances. People know their lives are getting shittier, they're just conditioned to blame the government rather than the wealthy, whereas any objective analysis of - say - the global financial crisis, clearly points the finger at the latter.

Lives aren't getting shitter they're getting better. Think about all sorts of progress that have been made in things like health, science and entertainment. Today you may have a smaller proportion of your income as disposable but there is so much you can do gratuitously that you don't even notice. If you really thought about it I'm sure you would come to the conclusion that you would prefer to be alive today than at any other point in history. What is rising is inequality, which I agree is bad. 

I think if you were to go out into the street and ask Mr. and Mrs. Bloggs who they blame for a lot of the faults in society they would blame the wealthy. They'd blame government too I'm sure. But I would hardly say it's a conditioning, more a lack of education, Government and rich people being intangible leviathans which are very easy to blame without much thought.

The global financial crisis cannot be objectively blamed on just a massive generalisation of ""wealthy"" people, you wouldn't blame David Beckham for the crisis would you. I think you should revise what you said here to the financial crisis was caused by a subset of *individuals* who are wealthy, wealthy people typically being in positions with control of lots of capital; you wouldn't stand for this sort of generalisation about Muslims or women, would you? Say that and I may even agree with you. But, it could also be easily argued that it was government's failure to set laws that would prevent the moral hazards which have led to the crisis. It's not a clear cut issue.

Some members of the Taliban fought with the Mujahideen (a catch-all term for those who fought against the Soviets) but so did many members of the Afghan National Army and the disparate warlord factions which caused the formation of the Taliban.

It's disingenuous to state that the Taliban are merely defending their homes. Prior to the 2001 invasion the Taliban were in the process of invading northern and central Afghanistan and perpetrating ethnic cleansing against the various ethnic and religious minorities who inhabit that area of the country. The Taliban do not necessarily subscribe to an Afghan identity either, they are much more likely to consider themselves Pashtun in common with their kin who live in the Western parts of Pakistan.

With the likes of Sturridge, Suarez and Johnson playing, just keeping possession and moving the ball around in attacking positions is going to make things happen, and that's something Allen does very well.

That their opinion when it came to something as **ambiguous** as a ""god"", carried more weight than someone who wasn't an expert in Maths. This is simply wrong. 

Also you've gone from:

&gt; Britain planned to build a **Taliban training camp for 2,000 fighters** in southern Afghanistan, as part of a top-secret deal to make them swap sides...The camp would also have provided **vocational training, including farming and irrigation techniques**, to offer people a viable alternative to growing opium.

&gt; But the Afghan government took issue with **plans to provide military training**, to turn the insurgents into a defence force.
Afghan government staff also claimed the “EU peace-builders” had handed over **mobile phones, laptops and airtime credit** to insurgents. They said the memory stick revealed plans to train the Taliban to use **secure satellite phones**, so they could communicate directly with UK officials.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/revealed-british-plan-to-build-training-camp-for-taliban-fighters-in-afghanistan-777671.html

&gt; Nato forces mistakenly **supplied food, water and arms to Taliban forces** in southern Afghanistan, officials today admitted.
Containers destined for local police forces were **dropped from a helicopter into a Taliban-controlled area** of Zabul province.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/18/nato.afghanistan

&gt; MI6′s meetings with the Taliban took place **up to half a dozen times** at houses on the outskirts of Lashkah Gah and in villages in the Upper Gereshk valley, to the north-east of Helmand’s main town. The compounds were **surrounded by a force of British infantry** providing a security cordon.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1573687/Britain-in-secret-talks-with-the-Taliban.html

&gt; In August 2007, the presidents of Afghanistan and Tajikistan walked side by side with the U.S. commerce secretary across a new **$37 million concrete bridge** that the Army Corps of Engineers designed to link two of Central Asia’s poorest countries.

&gt; Today, the bridge across the muddy waters of the Panj River is carrying much more than vegetables and timber: It’s **paved the way for drug traffickers to transport larger loads of Afghan heroin and opium** to Central Asia and beyond to Russia and Western Europe.

And secondly, it's because I want to leave Beligum. Belgium is nice enough if you only look skin deep but it's far from great. I have some issues with how the politics are going (and have always been going) but I also fear that the plans that are currently on the table will destroy Belgium. We have somewhat of the highest taxes in the world and don't get all that much back in return (we're nearly in last place when it comes to taxes paid/services received). The only reason companies put up with it is because we have Antwerp, and we have an amazing school system. Now they are going to change (read: destroy) this school system and that means that in 15 years, when the new generation graduates, they will not have had the same level of schooling we had. I'm afraid that we will lose our position of relative wealth and prosperity and shit is really going to hit the fan then. 

Now this is far from the only problem I have with the politics (you may know that there are some serious struggles between the Flemish and Walloons) but it was the final nail in the coffin.

true,ppphhh,null,null,"I don't think you need anything physical to buy a car, other than a driver's license. Technically you can buy a car without one. I don't know if a Belgian licence is valid here, I assume so but you should check.
   

When you buy the car you should get a registriation document with it (a V5 I think) which you put your details on then send to the DVLA to inform them you now own it. You *should* also get a service history book with the car, detailing what mechanical work has been done to it. I'm not sure if this is vital though.

  You will also need insurance *before* you drive the car anywhere. As an immigrant this might be expensive for you, I'm not sure. If you're under 25 it will probably be quite high anyway, I'd look into it before you move. You also need to tax and MOT the vehicle before you drive it. A tax disc looks like [this](http://lrcook.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/pd2676506.jpg) and is displayed in the front window, if there's not one you can buy it online. An MOT is a roadworthiness test done once a year, you should get a document with the car about this. If it hasn't been done the *only* place you can drive is a garage to get the MOT done, and you need to have an appointment booked.

As for actually buying, try [autotrader](http://www.autotrader.co.uk/) and ebay, they're the biggest websites for used vehicles I believe. Lots of car dealerships will use both to advertise so it's not just buying from people direct.

I think all of the above is true but please everyone correct me if it's not. OP you should check online to be sure. If you wander into a dealership and ask about the technicalities of buying a car in the UK they can probably explain it to you better than anyone, especially if you make it look like you're buying a car from them.",0,1382635951,null,0,false,0,ccyr7e8,t3_1p4pso,t1_ccyr7e8,t1_ccypujn,null,1428998953,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

Second hand car dealers are easy to find. 

When buying a car you need to ensure that you have the Vehicle Registration document that you send back to the DVLA to get the carpet in your name. It is a good idea to check that the car is not stolen or has outstanding finance on it which you can do by texting the registration to a service like [mycarcheck](https://www.mycarcheck.com/?gclid=CPaH4ND-r7oCFfHItAod32AAiw). 

One issue that people run into is that we have a lot of ANPR cameras in the UK, I have no idea if you have these in Belgium ). If you pass one they automatically check for things like insurance, so you need insurance before you even drive it home. If you are found to be driving without insurance you will loose the car there and then and have to prove you have insurance before you can collect it(and pay the storage fee) as well as this you will receive points on your licence.

- Without wanting to jump on the anti-Naughton bandwagon...Naughton was again looking pretty dodgy (and he wasn't even playing out of position)

- Lennon seemed to have a lot of the ball but there was never any end result.

Positives:

- Those moments when Sheriff were hard pressing, but Spurs didn't give a fuck and patiently kept posession.

I just did some maths assuming Honda is 7m out and hits it at 100km/h.  So if Joe just waits to react until Honda has struck the ball that is 0.252 seconds for him to read the flight of the ball and react to it.

Joe has to make some kind of decision based on Honda's body language (looks to me like Hart is expecting Honda to put it high), but then Honda doesn't even hit it where he's aiming for.  Hart has made his decision to stay on his feet and is beginning to raise his hands up (and see if you agree, but it looks like he's preparing to jump upwards) when he sees that the ball isn't going up, it going down, and manages (in those 0.252 seconds) to adjust his footing to get a block on it.",0,1382638928,null,0,false,0,ccysgkm,t3_1p4jy9,t1_ccysgkm,t1_ccyrhj2,null,1428998368,7,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,7

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;yes left wing arguments can be presented badly such as by the Daily Mail, but so can right wing ideas by The Guardian or the Independent.

Left wing ideas are mostly presented badly by the Guardian and Independent, neither of which are left wing.  The Guardian plays to a liberal intelligentsia chatterati, and mostly promotes progressive liberalish Keynesianism.  The Indie is very patchy on its political stance and is owned by Alexander Lebedev, the world's 358th richest individual, who is certainly no lover of the left (whether or not he's actually as dodgy personally, politically and commercially as some allege).

&gt;Also in the reverse left and right wing publications also make their ideology look appealing through rhetoric, both sides are guilty of framing debates. 

But the point you're missing is that there is no left wing media, the vast majority of papers are of the right, populist, conservative and ""economic"", with a few centrist (Labour/LibDem) supporting publications (Guardian, Indie, Mirror).  Where are the well-funded left wing papers calling for socialism and exploring issues from a socialist perspective?  The Morning Star?  Really?  The debate is framed by what's on the agenda, and these days, barely anything vaguely left is.

&gt;Lives aren't getting shitter they're getting better. Think about all sorts of progress that have been made in things like health, science and entertainment.

Technology and cheap energy.  The latter is probably not going to be with us for much longer unless we radically rethink, in which case the former will slow down its progress markedly.

&gt;Today you may have a smaller proportion of your income as disposable

That's a key point.  We can buy more cheap plastic tat than ever, but we can't afford to own our roof, eat well, travel to our place of work and stay warm.  Not so long ago, these problems were considered well on the way to being solved in the UK.

&gt;What is rising is inequality, which I agree is bad. 

It's not only generically ""bad"" but it affects everything, since it ramps the price of anything scarce out of reach of the relatively poor, even if they have ""more"" money than they did a decade or a century ago.

&gt;Government and rich people being intangible leviathans which are very easy to blame without much thought.

Was that a deliberate choice of word, have you read Hobbes' Leviathan?

&gt;The global financial crisis cannot be objectively blamed on just a massive generalisation of ""wealthy"" people, you wouldn't blame David Beckham for the crisis would you.

Not specifically no, but I'd bet he had a hand in it.  The problem is overaccumulation.  When too small a class of people have too great a proportion of the wealth, they struggle to find places to deploy it.  That's where destructive bubbles come from.  The financial crisis arose from a variety of property fuck ups in the US, together with a ballooning of derivatives.  We still have fuck knows how many trillions of bad debts and poisonous 'assets"" swirling around the financial system (despite the unprecedented bailouts globally) which will eventually come back to bite us, the Eurozone is a basketcase to safeguard French and German banks, whilst trillions more have been safehoused offshore by the modern day highway men and women.

&gt;it was government's failure to set laws that would prevent the moral hazards which have led to the crisis. It's not a clear cut issue.

To a degree I agree, but then generally those who say it's the government's fault for not regulating are the first to beg special cases for ""de""regulation (different regulation), and to tell us how disastrous it would be to let the too big to fail banks go under.  Since we did bail them out, they are bigger and more failure prone than ever.

&gt;Such as?

If you mean internationally, then obviously both French (for all its flaws) and American (based on the French) revolutions brought new and exciting opportunities.  There are many other examples but they're the most salient to us.  If you mean in the UK, we've had nothing on such a scale, but our history is littered with peasant revolts and local and regional rebellions which changed the nature of out governance and without which you would enjoy nearly so many rights as you do today - they shrugged off feudalism and gave us capitalism for one!  Read any decent radical history of the UK, I can give you a few pointers if you like.

People assume that time is a strict progression from cause to effect, but actually from  a non-linear, non-subjective view point it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey wimey, stuff (The Doctor (10))

The universe has to move forward. Pain and loss, they define us as much as love or happiness. Whether its a world or a relationship, everything has its time and everything ends. (Sarah Jane Smith)

Nobody important? Blimey, that's amazing. You know that in 900 years of time and space I've never met anyone who wasn't important before. (The Doctor (11))

The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don't always soften the bad things, but vice-versa, the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.  (The Doctor (11))

The universe is big, its vast and complicated and ridiculous. And sometimes, very rarely, impossible things just happen and we call them miracles. (The Doctor (11))

You know the very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common: They don't alter their views to fit the facts; they alter the facts to fit their views (The Doctor (4)) 

One day, I shall come back. Yes, I shall come back. Until then, there must be no regrets, no tears, no anxieties. Just go forward in all your beliefs and prove to me that I am not mistaken in mine. (The Doctor (1))

Additionally you could never go wrong with simple things like 

Doctor Who? (literally everyone.)

- [a list of more acts of those brave Taliban bravely defending the proud people of Afghanistan from education, security, bodily integrity and life](http://lubpak.com/archives/5150) but here are some highlights

- “Among the accounts of mutilations, beatings and arbitrary executions there was evidence of a new abomination: the torture of children. An unknown number of infants were savagely beaten during the Islamic militia’s 14-month occupation of Taloqan, the former headquarters of the Alliance, usually for the supposed crimes of their parents.” (Source: The Times [U.K.], 11/13/01) 

- When a Taliban raid discovered a woman running an informal school in her apartment, they beat the children; threw her down a flight of stairs causing her to break her leg; and then imprisoned her. They threatened to publicly stone her family if she didn’t sign a declaration of loyalty to the Taliban and its laws. 

- In August 1998, the Taliban captured Mazar-I-Sharif. There were reports that between 2,000 and 5,000 men, women and children — mostly ethnic Hazara civilians — were massacred by the Taliban after the takeover of Mazar-I-Sharif. During the massacre, the Taliban forces carried out a systematic search for male members for the ethnic Hazara, Tajik, and Uzbek communities in the city. Human Rights Watch estimates that scores, perhaps hundreds, of Hazara men and boys were summarily executed. There were also reports that women and girls were raped and abducted during the Taliban takeover of the city. 

- I see your point, they really are just defending their country aren't they. 

- But lets be sure -

- [the Taliban launched an attack on Mazar-i Sharif. Of 1500 defenders only 100 survived the engagement. Once in control the Taliban began to kill people indiscriminately. At first shooting people in the street, they soon began to target Hazaras. Women were raped, and thousands of people were locked in containers and left to suffocate. This ethnic cleansing left an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 dead.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban#Massacre_campaigns)



I don't believe you can think they are defending their home, I don't think you can say we shouldn't be intervening.

 It would be like thinking it was wrong to send the police in to a house where the Husband was routinely raping and beating the wife, refusing to let her leave the house, torturing and killing the children, and if the armed police came, he would use them as human shields and suicide bombers. And what's more, he would think he was morally justified to do so, and to encourage others to do so. 

Killing an unarmed injured combatant is morally wrong. I completely understand why they did it, and I'd gladly admit that if I was in that situation under those pressures with my friends body parts hanging from a tree, I may not have acted any differently. I believe they should be tried as it is a crime, they should be found guilty if that is the correct decision, but any jury should factor in exceptional circumstances for a lenient sentence. I don't believe it would be in the service of our society to sentence these men as full cold blooded murderers. I don't think they should apologise to anyone for what they've apparently done, certainly not to the Taliban. If they are found guilty, they should acknowledge they have done something illegal and accept and serve any punishment given. They should not be made arch-villains by a sensationalist press, that would be disgraceful.

- The drums starting as we zoom in on Curtis at the end adds to the feeling of motion towards inevitability.

- In a way, the whole sequence of events in this scene is representative of things and people coming in and out of our lives. Things change, and it's hard for us to get comfortable with that. It's easy to say goodbye if we know that we'll see someone again, but adding the finality of 'this is really the end' makes it almost unbearable.

&gt; i've never fully understood the motivation of companies that run these schemes, but that doesn't necessarily matter.

From the wiki on SIP schemes, but as you say it really does not matter.

""For the company a SIP provides a number of advantages. Employees with a vested interest in the success and performance of a company are more motivated to work as their investment is based upon the performance of the company. SIP's are also an extremely effective tool for staff retention within a company as participants are only liable to pay tax on shares acquired in the last 5 years and will only be eligible for Matching shares if they stay with the company for 3 years after the purchase of Partnership shares. Increasing employee retention in this way results in less expenditure for the company on overheads such as recruitment and the training of new recruits.
Companies running a SIP are also able to take advantage of Corporation tax relief for a variety of reasons including amongst others, the costs incurred putting the scheme in place &amp; subsequent running costs including funding for maintenance of a trust.""

As for who he scores against, there are only a few teams we're actually competing with for the title. That's at best 6 games a season for him to score ""big"" goals. Regardless of what anyone says, there's still 32 other games for him to score in and I'd argue that none of those are goals we don't need. Goals are goals, and that's what we want from our striker.

true,NesquikMike,null,null,"&gt;Left wing ideas are mostly presented badly by the Guardian and Independent, neither of which are left wing. The Guardian plays to a liberal intelligentsia chatterati, and mostly promotes progressive liberalish Keynesianism. The Indie is very patchy on its political stance and is owned by Alexander Lebedev, the world's 358th richest individual, who is certainly no lover of the left (whether or not he's actually as dodgy personally, politically and commercially as some allege).

You're right about the Guardian, that's exactly the problem I have with it. I think it does cater to more left-wing views too, but you're right in that is it's key audience. I think we just have different goal posts here. I would call the Guardian liberals &amp; the Independent left-wing, but you don't which is fair enough given your position.

&gt;We can buy more cheap plastic tat than ever, but we can't afford to own our roof, eat well, travel to our place of work and stay warm. Not so long ago, these problems were considered well on the way to being solved in the UK.

I think a lot of people (not all) are too easily convinced by flashy marketing tools and would be able to live a lot more comfortably if they weren't so keen to have an iPhone. Not everyone can enjoy unfettered consumption and a comfortable living. 

&gt;Was that a deliberate choice of word, have you read Hobbes' Leviathan?

I've not read it, it wasn't deliberate. I was struggling to think of a cleverer way to say big and uncontrollable. Leviathan was the only thing that came to my head so I went with it. 

&gt;Not specifically no, but I'd bet he had a hand in it.

I can't see any way Beckham had a hand in the financial crisis, he could have put his money with some financial advisor who speculated on derivatives I guess but that's not really Beckham's fault. I can't believe he would know how the financial system works. He was probably just offered a product ""give me your money and I will get you a good return"". Forgive me, for me Beckham can do no evil. 

&gt;The financial crisis arose from a variety of property fuck ups in the US, together with a ballooning of derivatives.

I still think the financial crisis is a lot more unclear than that. There were a great deal of factors that contributed, and economists still ponder over the cause today. 

&gt;If you mean internationally, then obviously both French (for all its flaws) and American (based on the French) revolutions brought new and exciting opportunities. 

You meant British didn't you? You were replying to my comment on how the British don't do revolutions. 

&gt;If you mean in the UK, we've had nothing on such a scale, but our history is littered with peasant revolts and local and regional rebellions which changed the nature of out governance and without which you would enjoy nearly so many rights as you do today - they shrugged off feudalism and gave us capitalism for one!

But these weren't revolutions, Britain has never had a holistic revolution in which a completely new system was implemented. The system has evolved and been refined, but there's never been a revolution. The system is too entrenched and you can never hope to overhaul it, and a good thing you couldn't too. Yes good things have come out of the system but that's the strength of the system it preserves our inherited rights. The danger of revolution is that it discards these rights, give me slow progress over revolution any day. That isn't to say I disapprove of radicalism, I'm very grateful of radicalism, as you said I should be, for bettering the system. I support radicalism today if I think it's warranted to better the system, but never too overthrow the system.

&gt;Only if you assume revolution is something bloody and violent.

If you want absolute accuracy it's a worthwhile investment, but that doesn't detract from what the Wand Company managed to do whilst still keeping it very affordable.

&gt;History also shows us that as inequality goes above a certain point, revolutions, of whatever kind, tend to follow. So rising concentration of wealth through increases in technology may hasten political change.

That is correct, but capitalist have learned this as well and realize that its in their best interest to keep the living standards of a population just high enough to prevent sufficient motivation to cause a revolution, to elaborate, the large welfare polices implemented in America happened during the cold war for a reason, to prevent people from getting any ideas that alternatives to capitalism may be superior. The USSR also had a lot of propaganda highlighting racial discrimination in America, which the US government knew were true, so in response the US government attempted to address such problems.

The current dismantling of welfare systems in America and the UK are happening because they are no longer needed, with the fall of communism there is no longer an ideological enemy to capitalism.

And lets not forget about the government using scape goats, like the situation in Russia with discrimination against gays.

True, but a government is capable of shutting down the internet no problem, and then what?

&gt;the internet IS going to revolutionise education, it is just a matter of when. And a radically improved education system will lead to a much more informed populace, and eventual political reform.

I completely agree here, the internet was instrumental in helping me get interested and informed on politics, however at the same time the internet allows the spread of misinformation even more effectively as well.

true,gomez12,null,null,"&gt;With coding there's a lot more abstract and / or analytical approach involved. There can be many ways of going about making something work - perhaps plumbing has some similarities - but coding does take a certain creativity to create something from nothing. 

I appreciate that, and I know it isn't easy. But it's still a bit of a stretch to say that it can benefit all children or future adults. I'd be happy for courses to be offered at school or college, but compulsory.. no.

I also agree that it has decent career potential. Though from what I've heard there are plenty of IT graduates - most of them are just rubbish.

As for sport - it wasn't so much the sport itself but the benefits it brings. If people can argue that coding makes you logical and creative, sport should encourage teamwork, not to mention keeping you fit, offsetting diabetes, and even improving academic performance in all other subjects. (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24608813)

There are so many things which should be included in the curriculum - more sport, finance lessons (like how to get loans, understanding mortgages and interest, operating a bank account, how to budget etc), cooking classes, nutrition lesson and many many other life skills.

* Fracking while obtaining natural gas also allows about 3.6-7.9% of the methane to escape into the atmosphere during the process. As methane is 23 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide this raises issues about its effect on the climate. This rate of methane escape has been found to be on the rise faster than anticipated and is twice that of conventional gas.

* Many of the chemicals used in fracking (the cocktails of chemicals used are unregulated in the sates) have been found to cause adverse health effects in humans as well as have the potential to cause great harm to the environment. These chemicals can also contaminate the groundwater which millions of people rely on for drinking water, not to mention the environmental effect this might have.

* Waste water that is returned to the surface and stored in pits also contains said chemicals, some of which have been linked to leukemia in children.

* Water can be contaminated with radioactive substances, in the states this has worked its way into the river systems.

Yes, but it's extremely hard to find a unifying point that **all** sects of Christianity believe either.  There are atheist sects of Christianity. There are sects that don't believe Jesus was God.  There are sects that focus more on Jesus's mother than they do on Jesus. 

And even within the sects there is little agreement.  Something like only 1% Catholics actually believe the core dogma as stated by the Catholic church.

The tech embodied in Concorde is *militarily* obsolete, because military needs have gone in a different direction from sheer raw long-haul supersonic cruising speed -- the focus is on agility and stealth. Also, the tech embodied in Concorde dates to the late 1960s; it's obsolete the way the Saturn V is obsolete. But at the time it was a technological marvel.

I thought that the gas extraction took place so far below the water table that it could not permeate into it? 

Do we not have heavier regulation than the states with regard to the use of chemicals etc, especially when pumping into the ground. 

Children should not be swimming in pits full of chemical waste and is there anything to say that the levels of radioactive substances are significant enough to cause damage. 

I'm sorry but I don't believe that if done properly fracking will have as large an impact on any of the other forms of fossil fuel extraction. It actually seems to have a lot smaller impact than mining. 

I don't believe that gas is the only answer but it is a much better alternative to coal plants and, if we don't extract it here then we will continue to buy from Russia etc is that ok because it's not in the UK? Renewables have a place in the future but personally I think nuclear should provide the majority of our power alongside gas/coal and renewables

Normally you might not even notice being redirected through IWF caches to view legal images, in fact it might even be faster.

At around the same time, cloudflare had issues, so for those who were using ISPs that are signed up to use the IWF, the IWF's proxy software displayed a technical error message which referred to a DNS failure - which was in fact a correct error message.

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"For 5 million, I'd gamble on him. The problem then becomes, how do we accommodate our strikers?

Let's say we hold onto Suarez. Then we pair him with Sturridge whenever possible, but obviously there will be injuries, suspensions, etc. So then we have Aspas, Guidetti, and Borini all eventually on the bench. If we line up with a front three, then those two plus an additional wide man, but then we need to add Sterling, maybe Ibe, maybe Moses if he stays, so the competition changes from 5 (SAS, Aspas, Borini, Guidetti) for 2 to 8 (The previous 5 plus Ibe, Moses, and Sterling) for 3, which is still a lot.

Second scenario. Suarez leaves. This means we restructure the team. It's unlikely that we find a like-for-like replacement for Suarez, but at the same time, we can't sell him and NOT replace him. However, losing Suarez does (ironically) free us up tactically. At the moment, we can't afford to NOT play SAS together when they're both able, because of their ability and chemistry.

If we opt for a front 3, with a Sturridge as a lone striker, we're going to want to invest in real (or at least inverted) wingers. Moses would be great, but Borini and Aspas are not going to cut it as wingers over a season, even as backups to Moses and Sterling.

If we stay with a front 2, then we'll have to buy a new marquee striker, since Sturridge + Aspas/Borini/Guidetti is much less intimidating than Sturridge + Suarez. If we bring in a new striker, then we have the same situation as before, with 5 strikers for 2 spots, with very obvious favorites.

Aspas doesn't like not being the big fish in the small pond, and Borini will probably not get a shout for us again, unfortunately, so how we proceed will certainly be interesting to see.",0,1382650847,null,0,false,0,ccyxf8d,t3_1p57ze,t1_ccyxf8d,t3_1p57ze,null,1428996052,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

You can't start a scientific debate, then changed your mind because of emotional ties to the subject and make me out to be some kind of monster.

This isn't a pissing contest as to whom is more emotionally invested in their respective subjects. Though I will say may grandmother is an ECT patient who a few months back took an overdose on her prescription pain medication, opening the door to your nans house to find her semi-concious in a pool of her own vomit and then putting her in the recovery position and calling an ambulance isn't particularly fun, she's now on a psychiatric ward.

My dad hasn't told me much about his depression, but I know he was on medication for it after he divorced my mum and then again after he split with my step mum.

I've got a blooming co-morbid disorder along with my depression that's going nicely.  I wont go into any more detail about myself than I already have.


But for you both to be as childish as you were, I find that not only ridiculous, but also extremely disrespectful. None of us, as far as I am aware are qualified in any medical sciences, so next time you feel like starting a debate with me, let me know if you're going to abandon it one post in and then make me out to be some kind of evil person.

If you go to the (*proper*) south west, you need to have a genuine Cornish pasty, jam &amp; clotted cream on scones, and at least one pint of cloudy cider (getting lost in the countryside and buying a few grubby-looking bottles from a random farm is the best thing to do, they're staggeringly good and normally quite strong!). Having said all that, doing Cornwall in 3 days might be a stretch (though just FYI, there is a sleeper service between Paddington and Penzance which stops through Devon and Cornwall), and it is 110% worth it! If you were me, I'd get a sleeper out &amp; work your way back up, Bristol is 2 hours from the capital, and if you happen to be going from Heathrow the connection is dead simple.

I accept there are very limited and specific scenarios where a person's face needs to be visible so they can be identified, when being prescribed medicine, when going through passport control at a border, when giving evidence in a court room ... but a public street is NOT such a space. 

The argument that always gets banded about is that women are 'forced' to wear Islamic clothing by patriarchal husbands and male relatives, well, that may be true in some instances, but assuming it's always the case takes away from the autonomy of Muslim women and their ability to make their own life decisions.

I have known secular men and women be in relationships with controlling partners who controlled what they wore, where they went, who they spoke to and so forth. I don't see a moral distinction between a woman being pressured to wear a burqa 'to look modest' and a woman being pressured to wear a mini skirt 'to look sexy'. 

The answer to tackling oppression and domestic abuse where it occurs is not to attack a specific culture or a specific piece of clothing, the answer is to work towards making EVERYONE, whether they be a Somali woman or a Scouse man, aware of their rights under the law within this country and to ensure that people from all walks of life feel comfortable and confident in seeking help from the police or other services if there are problems at home. 

A ban on the burqa will just mean those women who are enduring abusive relationships or family dynamics will be kept at home, a far, far better approach for tackling oppression when it occurs is to empower people and to build trust between ethnic communities and the wider community so people know where and how to seek help should they need it.

Real life is real life, and mine is pretty good, all things considered, there's quite a bit more doing chores by hand than I'd like, but robot-butler probably wouldn't understand the subtle but vital differences in tea preference anyway. It's the idea that somehow, somewhere, in a parallel universe, there might be a whole new world and set of rules to discover, not because I actually want to go out and discover them, but because imagining they're out there makes the universe feel big, and me feel small and insignificant, which is something I take an odd sort of comfort in. The universe is vast and unknown, and whatever I do doesn't really matter.

From a more academic point of view, of course, even the most outlandish fiction tells us a lot about ourselves.

Science fiction tells us about our hopes and fears for the future; the plot of *The War of the Worlds*, for example, is that aliens come from Mars in a hostile invasion of Earth. What *The War of the Worlds* is *about*, considering its publication 120 odd years ago, is the optimism of looking out toward the stars from our newly industrialised world and hoping, or fearing, that we are not alone and that others may have achieved more than us. Closer to home, it's about the very real fear of invasion, not by aliens, but by entirely terrestrial foreign powers.

Fantasy fiction almost always involves a very definite struggle between good and evil. There are often two opposing sides, both with powers far beyond those of the general population. We know, ultimately, that those with power will often corrupt, and use it to their own advantage, at the expense of everybody else. But there are also those who will use their powers to protect those who cannot protect themselves. Not only is this power play present in our wider society, but we also struggle with it every day in ourselves; if Gandalf, Vimes, Peter Grant and even Harry flipping Potter can manage it, so can we.

Crime fiction teaches us about justice, horror teaches us caution, romance allows us to go on with the vital belief that we will be loved, and so on and so forth.

Fiction is, in a way, about stepping back from reality so that we can learn more about it. Also there's dragons, you can't go wrong with a nice dragon.",0,1382654542,null,0,false,0,ccyyu2u,t3_1p5czq,t1_ccyyu2u,t1_ccyy73y,null,1428995321,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

No sorry, i looked and i couldn't find a comparison.

&gt; I thought that the gas extraction took place so far below the water table that it could not permeate into it?

Nope, the EPA did a review of this (i'm sure others have also) and found that both the chemicals and methane contaminated the groundwater.

&gt; Do we not have heavier regulation than the states with regard to the use of chemicals etc, especially when pumping into the ground.

While we do have pre-existing regulations controlling water quality etc (such as the EU Water Framework Directive) permits are still available to pump chemicals into the ground.

&gt; Children should not be swimming in pits full of chemical waste and is there anything to say that the levels of radioactive substances are significant enough to cause damage.

Haha, true, but the damage was not from swimming in it. It was from indirect contact through gases and substances leaching into the local environment. Not until it happens no, ethical committees aren't great fans of testing on humans :)

&gt; I'm sorry but I don't believe that if done properly fracking will have as large an impact on any of the other forms of fossil fuel extraction. It actually seems to have a lot smaller impact than mining.

I don't think it will either, i was referring to renewable, which do not use fossil fuels. One effect it could have is due to excess supply of natural gas it could essentially undercut coal, thus promoting the closure of coal plants. That however is just conjecture.

Whether or not it has a more significant effect than mining could be contested. At present when mines are made the company running them commits to restore the land at their own cost to at least the state it was before they broke ground, normally at the guidance of an environmental consultant. Much the same happens with landfill sites. Fracking does not make any accommodations for this, once the groundwater is contaminated there is very little that can be done to change it. If rivers become contaminated as a result they are not obligated to fix them.

&gt; I don't believe that gas is the only answer but it is a much better alternative to coal plants and, if we don't extract it here then we will continue to buy from Russia etc is that ok because it's not in the UK? Renewables have a place in the future but personally I think nuclear should provide the majority of our power alongside gas/coal and renewables up until fusion becomes a realistic option.

Natural gas is definitely better than coal, the contentious issue is how that gas is obtained. While Russia do use fracking we can control what we want our environment to be like, we can't control theirs. Just because they choose to accept any damage to it that doesn't mean we should do the same.

As for nuclear the main issue is cost, it is astronomically expensive to build, maintain and decommission as well as taking a long time to start up. Coal has to go and fast if we have any hope of stemming runaway climate change, might be tough but that is the reality. Renewables are the way forward, they just lack funding due to the massive amount of lobbying against them and the UK governments current hatred for all things green.

I have no objections to hair covering, loose robes, or men in white dresses (though it does look ridiculous). But I do strongly object to a face covering - regardless of whether it is on a ""muslim woman"" (in quotes because who really knows who is underneath? You can't make assumptions), a teenage kid in a balaclava, or a motorcyclist who has failed to remove his helmet at a petrol station.

One doesn't have to ""like"" face coverings to have ""respect for other cultures and religions"". It's just a fact that, in this particular case, foreign culture is incompatible with historical British culture. And there's no shame in being proud of your own culture.

I don't know about you but I don't need to see someone's face to regard them as fully human. You have to make an extra effort to communicate if you can't read emotions, but that's true of this conversation we are having right now. The fact that something makes you a bit uncomfortable is not a reason to go taking rights away from other people.   

Why would a person in an abusive domestic situation be more likely to seek help if wider society forces them to dress a certain way? Why is a controlling society virtuous if a controlling partner or parent is not? Has the veil ban in France lead to any rise whatsoever in the number of people seeking help? Or has it led to more distrust and distance between communities? 

If you ban the veil you turn it in to a symbol of resistance to a controlling State, you make it relevant to the Muslim women who would not normally have any cultural ties to it, it's not usually worn by Egyptian women but when there were tensions there between secular and religious groups they started wearing it in much greater numbers. 

In most cities in the UK this is a virtual non-issue, there are a few places where veils are becoming more common, yet we are still only talking about a small minority within a minority, to make a huge deal out of it by making it a matter of law is totally disproportionate. We already have clear laws around domestic abuse and when a person must make themselves identifiable. 

The balaclava argument is redundant, I am free to wear one if I wish, if I go out for Halloween I can wear a Halloween mask, no one is going to suggest I'm being 'dehumanised' if I do so. 

Your use of words like 'indoctrination' really suggests that you have an agenda here, they may have been brought up in a certain culture, but so have the Jews, Sikhs and Catholics in this country, so have the 2nd generation atheists, if you want to give individuals the freedom of religious choice and conscience that you claim to want you don't start by criminalising them for their current beliefs, if you see a person as a victim you don't make THEM the criminal under the law. 

In the bad old days crack downs on illegal Prostitution and trafficking involved punishing the people who were being exploited, now the police go after the clients, the pimps and the gang masters. 

That's how you tackle abusive behaviour, you punish the perpetrator, not the victim, and you accept that people make free choices that must be respected unless there is an absolutely compelling reason to doubt their autonomy or to consider their choices damaging to wider society. 

My inability to see a woman's face as she walks past me on the street doesn't make the criteria. 

As to the hiding abuse argument -well you can hit a person anywhere, a person in jeans and a long sleeve jumper might be covered in bruises for all you know, the answer is to have services available for people when they need to seek help.

He does not have a great RANGE of passing. He does not play those fizzing passes into feet like Carrick, he doesn't switch the play like Huddlestone, and he doesn't spray those balls down the channels with the outside of his foot like Modric. 

When he drops deep and gets on the ball he does not really tend to make much happen IMO. He runs around a lot and plays very simple passes, which is nice, but we have players who do both of those things better.

Holtby has also been inconsistent about where he sees his best position. He's said deeper but he's also said he likes playing in the hole. His passing style just makes no sense for a deeper role IMO. 

You're right to point out he doesn't have the greatest first touch so he goes missing against teams which press him well, but he's still decent at drifting into space and getting on the ball.

Naughts and Vlad were both pretty hopeless positionally or in Naught's case 1v1 at times in the first half. The vast majority of the danger Sheriff were creating was coming right at those two players. I honestly think that's why Vlad was moved out to right back rather than just shift Jan to left back--we wanted to deal with their left-sided player better.

I just don't think he was at his best in the first half today. He seemed more secure strangely enough moving to the left, because I guess their right-sided player wasn't as dangerous. 

That said, I think Naughton is a good player to have in the squad. He can do a job on the right side most of the time even in the Premier League, and he can handle playing left back in a pinch or in a cup game. 

We rotate / get injuries enough that he gets plenty of matches and he doesn't seem to bitch about anything. He's a likable guy.

true,Film-Noir-Detective,mcgann,McGann,"I personally prefer RTD to Moffat as a showrunner. In my mind, RTD wrote better characters and companions than Moffat, as well as having more solid seasons in general. I think Moffat has some great ideas, he gave us the Weeping Angels and the crack in S5 is second only to S3's Mr. Saxon in terms of best story arc. However, he squanders his great ideas (ie. THAT scene from Flesh and Stone), and in the series's after S5, makes his arcs too short (Clara), or too long (ugh, River). I also felt that his characters were very stale, Amy and Rory were basically static as character for the whole of S6b and S7a, and my enjoyment if River Song's character is inversely proportional to the number of episodes she's in. I feel Moffat fills his arcs and seasons with a whole ton of crazy ideas, but that causes us to forget why we loved him so much as a writer in the first place. In seasons filled with crazy things happening with time and innovative monsters, his monsters and ideas become par-for-the-course, no longer being jumping out at us for being memorable. I feel RTD managed to put enough ""normal"" in his stories (ie. trips to companions' homes) that the great ideas and scripts (ie. most of Moffat's) were memorable. Moffat tenure would be better suited if he had more of those things that brought us back down to earth. Oh, and don't get me started on his over-hyping of things, where every episode and it's mother is going to ""change the show forever"" or ""be the most important point in the Doctor's life"".

If you can't, then they'll help out. But if you can't learn a subject when your lecturer is a *world leader* in the subject, it's not generally the lecturer's fault.

Nottingham and Sheffield are very good at medicine, so if you want a doctorate in mending monkeys rather than because you've produced original research, that's probably the place to go. Sheffield's got an okay reputation in (ugh) Chemistry.

true,syntax,null,null,"&gt; But if you can't learn a subject when your lecturer is a world leader in the subject, it's not generally the lecturer's fault.

Actually, I'd disagree on that point (and I've worked with many professors who are world leaders).

Just because someone is good at pushing the bounds of mankinds knowledge; (or more cynically - getting people to fund them pushing at the bounds of knowledge) does not inherently make them good at teaching.  

Consider Maxwell's book, where he introduces the equations of electromagnetism.  Ever read it?  It's terrible; it took other people who were much better educators to struggle through that, to make that accessible, before the fruits of his research really started to come through.

The above needs to be tempered with one important point: the best person to learn from is someone who is _both_ at the leading edge of research, and a good teacher.  But if you're selecting for only one of those attributes, it's not apparent to me that research expertise is more important than teaching, at undergraduate (and even taught postgrad in some cases) [0].

It is often noted that those at the cutting edge can often fail to give a grounding in the basics to students; as they've forgotten (or possibly even outright skipped) what it was like to _not_ know them, and thus are less able to identify the root problem that a student is having.  Many professors are able to escape that trap - and many are living examples of it.

If you want to maintain that Imperial is a 'better' place to study, you should be citing matters about teaching and learning there; not about it's research.

Meanwhile I think Moffat's doing a lot more to play with the story, to tell stories with fully rounded characters, while having the absolute most reverence for the past show. He is a die-hard Who fan, and it shows. 

Under his leadership we've also received some of Who's best episodes from other writers, including Neil Gaiman with ""The Doctor's Wife."" And I can never not feel my heart torn in two when I watch ""Vincent and The Doctor"" Easily one of my absolute favorite stories.

It's not as rare in terms of number of staff; as you would percieve as an undergraduate.

Probably, I use left to mean anti-hierarchy and anti-capitalist.

&gt;I think a lot of people (not all) are too easily convinced by flashy marketing tools and would be able to live a lot more comfortably if they weren't so keen to have an iPhone. Not everyone can enjoy unfettered consumption and a comfortable living. 

I agree the power of marketing is a problem, but what I was attempting to touch on was how gadgets and other items manufactured in the developing world are artificially low cost because of the neo-colonial structures of global capitalism, whilst all the non-discretionary spending which people need to make for their survival and well-being has become a greater and greater share of their income (housing costs, food costs, transport costs, fuel costs).

&gt;I can't see any way Beckham had a hand in the financial crisis, he could have put his money with some financial advisor who speculated on derivatives I guess but that's not really Beckham's fault.

This was pretty much what I was meaning.  When I said ""had a hand in"", I wasn't really implying blame or moral responsibility so much as causality.  There was more and more cash washing around at the ""top"" with fewer and fewer profitable places to put it.

If you fall out of form, there should be a player there eager to step in and take your spot - someone with enough quality to take that spot from you if he works hard enough - I think that's Mourinho wants to happen in as many positions as possible, it seems to make everyone work that much harder, if you get the balance just right - and Mourinho seems to be really good at figuring out that balance.

So yeah, a long winded agreement :)  Imagine how good of a form De Bruyne would have to be to break into the first team the way we've been playing - he's not that far I don't think, but he's still quite not there, or else he'd be getting more starts.  It's dangerous - but I have faith in Mourinho that this will push De Bruyne to play at levels he's capable of, but just hasn't reached yet.

true,TheJedibugs,null,null,"This is from the FAQ on the Wand company's website: ""we had to make some slight detail changes in order to make it possible to manufacture the sonic screwdriver and make it affordable for the widest possible number of fans.  Sharp-eyed 10th Dr. experts might notice the following tiny differences:

Emitter dome:
The sonic screwdriver remotes light-up Blue tip is made from a blue, self colored, injection molded acrylic. The prop emitter dome was made in clear acrylic painting blue on the inside. Although the color is a close match to the prop during its time on-screen the props paint degraded and by the end of filming, had a very patchy appearance.

Emitter head:
The sonic screwdriver remote emitter head has been made by a multistage process were aerospace grade aluminum is first extruded to create the longitudinal shapes and then machine by computer-controlled lathe and milling machines create the iconic cage shape. The original prop was machined by hand, resulting in some slight asymmetry. Also due to heavy use, the original prop's emitter head has acquired accidental damage in the form of nicks and scratches. 

Clear Tube:
The sonic screwdriver remote's clear tube is made from injection molded poly carbonate. The injection molding process requires that the tube's inner core has a slight taper and a perfectly smooth surface, so that the part can be removed from the molds during the manufacturing process. The original prop's tube was made by drilling a hole through the middle of a rod of acrylic, resulting in a slightly distressed inner surface. Residual stresses in micro cracks on the surface have over time, eventually lead to larger visible cracks and even small voids, giving the surface a crazed, translucent look.

Main Body:
The original props main body was turned from aluminum and the craquelure effect was created using multiple layers of paint with different trying rates. As such, this process is completely random and there is no way to replicated using paint, as each service pattern would be unique. In order to get as close as possible to the original craquelure effect, the original prop surface texture was painstakingly copied, line by line, and engraved on the inside of the injection mold tool used to create the sonic screwdriver remote control's main body in engineering grade ABS. While we have carefully copied the surface texture of the original prop, due to the limitations of the injection molding process and the method of creating a pattern on the inside of the mold, there are slight differences between the sonic screwdriver remote control in the original prop's surface finish. The main body of David Tennant screen used prop is attached to the sonic screwdriver structure by three screws. On the original prop, these are painted to match the main body color. For the sonic screwdriver remote control, these screws are not necessary and so have been omitted from the design.

Slider:
In the original prop there is a small aluminum block the front end of the slider track which is painted with the craquelure effect. To help with the assembly and to fix the orientation of the main body with respect to the extending portion, in the sonic screwdriver remote control this block is not a separate piece, but it's part of the lower castellated ring and is not painted. Due to internal construction differences, the slider track on the sonic screwdriver remote control is slightly shorter than the track on the real prop.
The sonic screwdriver remote control's slider pad button incorporates the light plate so they can indicate charge status. On the original prop, the button does not light up.

End Cap:
The original prop's and End cap is turned on a lathe and glued into position. The sonic screwdriver remote controls removable and Is molded, house is a strong new Denian magnet and also conceals the USB charging socket.""

So there you have it. A laundry-list of inaccuracies from the manufacturer's website. The teeth are also off, as the representative from the company stated in a public forum (but apparently did not update the FAQ with that info). None of those issues listed above are present on the CT replica. 
In essence, Laser scanning gave them an excellent starting point and allowed them to create what is, by far, the most accurate sonic ever put out by a licensee, but there were manufacturing trade-offs needed to cram all the functionality into something that was designed to hold no more than a battery and an LED. 
And, man, I really don't want to get into a whole thing about how possible it is for CT to have gotten his hands on the actual sonic. I admit that it seems super-unlikely. But, like Proto-Kun, I have seen the proof first hand. He got it. And a lot more besides. A LOT more. But it doesn't matter if you believe me or not. It doesn't even matter if I totally changed your mind so that you think CT's is worth the $400 (it is, by the way)... Because you can't have one anyway. They're sold out.

All of these do fantastic work, and they're comparatively large and well-funded charities. As such they might not be able to accept a donation if you insist that it gets used for a specific purpose (large charities rarely have enough staff to ensure that such requests are definitely adhered to).

So you might want to consider any of the thousands of local charities that do similar work. Most towns or city neighourhoods have small charities helping the families of ill children, or vulnerable pensioners, and so on, and actually a £140 donation to them would probably be far more important than to one of the national multi-million pound organisations above (which I repeat do do some fantastic work).

One of the big problems with 'flu, is that it's a family of viruses, hence the need to be vaccinated regularly, so you don't get a total immunity anyway, though from what I read, it does help make things less severe if you do get one of the ones that you're not directly vaccinated against.

But I have reasons listed for why each episode should be watched, so you can decide which you might want to skip if you don't have time for all of them. I've left out some really good episodes, on order to give you (mostly) ones that will give you the broad-strokes necessary to be ready for the 50th. Though, there are also some big changes left out, so you'll still feel the need to go back and watch more to fill in the gaps. Have fun!

*""Rose"": Necessary to introduce the Doctor. 
*""Dalek"": introduces the Doctor's most famous adversaries. 
*""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"": Apart from being one of the overall best stories, this two-parter introduces an important recurring character and reveals some important insight into the Doctor's character. 
*""Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways"": Not the greatest two-parter, but it's needed to introduce the concept of Regeneration. And Eccleston is great in it. 
*""The Christmas Invasion"": Introduces the 10th doctor. 
*""School Reunion"": Good episode that delves into some Doctor Who history in an accessible way. 
*""The Girl in the Fireplace"": Just. So. GOOD. 
*""Blink"": Not negotiable. Watch it. 
*""Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead"": Apart from being excellent, it introduces a character *who becomes very central to future seasons. 
*""Midnight"": Creepy, dark and utterly wonderful. 
*""The Waters of Mars"": Very good, shows what happens when the Doctor starts to believe his own hype. 
*I am skipping over Tennant's regeneration story here, as it involves too much back story. You'll come back to it later, when you watch all the episodes (it will happen).
*""The 11th Hour"": Meet the 11th Doctor and his new companion. 
*""Vincent and the Doctor"": Van Gough, Bill Nighy, and you'll need a box of tissues. 
*""The Lodger"": just a very solid episode. 
*""The Doctor's Wife"": Neil Gaiman! Also, very excellent episode. 
*""The girl who waited"": Good character builder
*""Asylum of the Daleks"": introduces a future companion. Ish. 
*""The Angels Take Manhattan"": it's not perfect, but it's a key moment for The Doctor. 
*""The Snowmen"": new companion, plus some fun sometime-companions. 
*""Cold War"": Re-introduction of a classic villain in a very good way. 
*""The Name of the Doctor"": The most recent episode, leads straight into the 50th.

true,NesquikMike,null,null,"&gt;what I was attempting to touch on was how gadgets and other items manufactured in the developing world are artificially low cost because of the neo-colonial structures of global capitalism

I agree with you that;s a problem

&gt;There was more and more cash washing around at the ""top"" with fewer and fewer profitable places to put it.

They were very profitable for a while at least, and the financial system was doing its job before the crash came along. It was funding economic growth for the UK. Which I'm sure you would agree was a good thing. I don't think they were aware of the faults in the financial system at the time, they were trying to make a buck. How did they do this? By investing money which ultimately goes to businesses and mortgages. I just think you seem to want to blame the financial class for the crisis, but ultimately I think no one is to blame they had created a huge uncontrollable monster. But this is humanity we make errors we can't control everything, which is another reason why I'm suspicious of revolution.

&gt;So we never moved from feudalism to mercantile capitalism to industrial capitalism to financial capitalism?

Those were economic evolutions, I know they are called revolutions but the actual process is an evolution and not a revolution. There is no single event that changes everything all at once. A factory opens it's profitable, another one opens and so on... It's evolution at an accelerated pace. Also I was referring to governmental revolutions which is what I assumed these conversations were about.

&gt;What about the Bloodless Revolution of 1688, the People Power Revolution which ousted Marcos of the Philippines, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, and on, and on and on.

Ok these are certainly bloodless revolutions, but I think you're missing the nuance of my point. These revolutions did not lead to a desired society, there was a power vacuum in which awful things happen in as groups battles for power.

&gt;For example ""The main threat to political stability and the success of Czechoslovakia’s shift to democracy was likely to come from ethnic conflicts between the Czechs and the Slovaks, which resurfaced in the post-Communist period.""

Also I wouldn't call the revolution of 1688 a revolution in governance, they overthrew the monarch and brought in a new one, and started the move towards the parliamentary system we have today. The monarchy remained which still had the most power, the system of governance wasn't revolutionarily changed. 

How many revolutions have we had and we still have not hit on the right system, most of them end in violence, why should we put our trust in a revolution?",0,1382690542,null,0,false,0,ccz9czi,t3_1p2zb1,t1_ccz9czi,t1_ccz4o3o,null,1428990192,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Obviously not every copper is corrupt, of course, and it's a damn shame that the current moral crisis within the police (as a whole) is reflecting on the decent individual officers who are doing a good job.  And this is all the more reason for something to be done to root out the bad cops.

The Home Secretary is also supposed to be beefing up the IPCC, which I think would help.  I don't know whose bright idea it was to let the police investigate themselves in certain cases, but it obviously doesn't work.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I just think you seem to want to blame the financial class for the crisis, but ultimately I think no one is to blame they had created a huge uncontrollable monster. But this is humanity we make errors we can't control everything

See, here we really differ.  You're prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt and talk of errors and accidents, I hear of them betting against the investments they were selling to their clients whilst calling them toxic shit privately, and all the many other acts of malfeasance by institutions and individuals (from money laundering, through the LIBOR fraud, to the mis-selling scandals and the blatant racism in mortgage arrangements), and I think they knew exactly what they were doing.  And yet none of them have yet been convicted of anything (we just might get a bit of joy over LIBOR), although they've destroyed millions of jobs, trashed economies, screwed up people's lives and retirements, damaged the prospects of a generation and, in fact, killed countless thousands, or perhaps millions of people.  If you've not seen it and you want a quick peak behind the curtain, you should watch [this](http://vimeo.com/27292661), which is about the best documentary on the crisis to date.

&gt;How many revolutions have we had and we still have not hit on the right system, most of them end in violence, why should we put our trust in a revolution?

I'm not saying we should - necessarily - but it's a crucial option when change by other means has been taken off the table.  And arguably it has.  Also, just to address the matter of violence for a second, I wonder the extent to which you see the casual daily violence of the current system, the drip drip drip of deaths it causes and lives it destroys?  People always see the bloody fury of revolution, but they are usually blind to the relentless cold blooded murder of the decades and centuries which preceded it.  Did you notice those thousands, even millions of deaths caused by the financial crisis, or were they largely invisible to you?  Revolutions can bring incredible gains even when the don't achieve all or indeed any of their objectives, and, if they are successful and endure, the narrative about them slowly morphs over time and history is rewritten to sanitise them and make them seem less revolutionary.  When they fail or do not endure, the horrors are exposed and exaggerated by their opponents.  Who notices or cares that Mao's revolution in China coincided with dramatic improvements in life expectancy, or that India's early experiments with capitalism resulted in excess famine deaths such that in less than a decade they had surpassed those during China's great famine?",0,1382692099,null,0,false,0,ccz9k69,t3_1p2zb1,t1_ccz9k69,t1_ccz9czi,null,1428990098,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I don't think there needs to be one. Look at the riots in London. There was no political force behind them, but I would say it is clear that inequality was a key cause. Similarly look at occupy, there is no real universal philosophical political agreement in the movement, except that massive inequality is bad. Now, the riots were swiftly controlled, and many would argue occupy has not achieved anything at all. But both such events have sparked the debate about political and economic systems primarily *after* they started. If inequality gets significantly worse, then events like this would be bigger and more mainstream, which would eventually lead to some kind of revolution.

&gt;government is capable of shutting down the internet no problem, and then what?

Experience is shown that this is a VERY bad idea for governments to do. Look at Egypt and Syria. Especially in places where internet use is a well established part of culture. The internet (while it can be a force for organising and political activism) is a force for apathy. And it has become a core part of people's social lives.

My brother was a Man U fan and he always picked them in FIFA 05. The game would automatically pick their rivals on kick-off mode, and that was Liverpool. Soon enough I heard that they won a champions league cup. Unfortunately, I was too young (12) to know how important that was.

Eventually, I got to know the players' names, and call them out and brag about how I had Mascherano and Alonso and Torres and Gerrard and Kuyt. Soon after, I went to University, and learned other people liked football and played fifa a lot. So I started keeping score of news and results. I was so happy when we got 2nd, then was heartbroken to see Liverpool fall to 7th(!). I began watching a bit, but the shitty football they played did not please me enough to get hooked. What *did* start me watching every game was the 11/12 season with Kenny in charge. The fact that we played so much better football, plus that we won the Carling Cup and got to the FA Cup final had me hooked.

Doesn't think the car will amount to anything back before Ford and co.

That average person now has control over the purse strings of any innovative endeavour in a socialist world. The free market (as in being free to pursue your own ends, not being free from regulation, law and tax) is absolutely vital for driving innovation.

I'm in favour of the time just being the actual fucking time and if people need to get up earlier or later to make the best of the day then they do. Set the clocks to be the actual time and then work out the work/school day from there. Don't decide well farmers have to get up at four in the summer but it'd be nicer if that was five so we'll change the fucking clocks. But then kids will have to go to school in the dark so let put them right again for the winter. No. Just let the farmers get up at four (like many other shift workers do) and set the school day in an area so they go to/return from school in the light for as much of the year as possible.

This almost made sense when agriculture was the main industry, and they were pretty much the only people (of any status who had to work wierd hours). But now so many people work unsocial hours for all sorts of reasons. It's stupid and only done for historical (not even traditional) reasons.

Stick with winter time. Let kids go to school around 9 and return around 3 for maximum light times. Let the rest of us deal with it and plan our days around what need to be done.",0,1382697632,null,0,false,0,ccza8jn,t3_1p5d8j,t1_ccza8jn,t1_ccz4frc,null,1428989783,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

But does that mean you'd not want to ask what some British food that you've only heard of before actually is before deciding whether you want to try it?

Even if you think you know what a sausage is, I strongly recommend you ask before even thinking about eating a British one. Or better still, don't - just don't eat the sausage. But having learned the term ""Yorkshire Pudding"" in school and seen a photo doesn't mean you know what one is.

There are a lot of benefits to this kind of system, mainly it allows us to see what someone is like actually within the job rather than just someone who interviews well and if they turn out to be useless then their hours can be reduced to their contracted hours, effectively sacking them but without having to go through all the legally required stuff like written warnings etc.

There are also benefits to the employee, such as if you're contracted to only 6 hours then technically if you don't want to work more hours on a given week for any reason then they cannot make you work more than 6 as anything more is voluntary on your part.

That being said, I would recommend giving the job a few weeks, try hard to be a model employee and sometime mid-November I would approach your boss or line manager and ask if your basic contract hours could be raised to give you more stability. That way you find out where you stand, if they are unwilling to raise your contracted hours then it shows you are prob gonna be doing a lot less hours post xmas.

Also check your contract as most places with a low hour contract will give you holiday entitlement based on your average hours worked rather than your contract but some will stipulate that your holiday entitlement is linked pro rata to your hours

It seems the growth is driven by construction (which is not necessarily a bad thing), probably partially because of the government extending credit to allowing people to borrow to buy - remember that nobody will build a house unless they can make a healthy profit on it, and land is near enough costless to hold, which means that it's the government *guaranteeing* the price inflation of property, to ensure the profit thresholds are met.

People's living standards are still being pressured due to inflation &amp; price increases, and barometers here and there like retail spending, are a bit worrying.

I disagree about spoiled votes.

Not turning up is simply too easily dismissed as a lack of will to participate.

The gas processing plants don't have to be near the well-heads, so you might be able to find existing landscapes that already have service roads and carrying capacity for small well-heads. Farms, forestry commision sites and scattered villages may already have roads and infrastructure ideal for well-heads (but not the initial fracking site and gas processor). 

The well-heads themselves don't have to be ugly tin sheds, they might choose to use traditional (or mock-traditional) [ barn designs](http://www.wealddown.co.uk/Buildings/Focus-on-working-buildings).

Thats why there was a protest at Balcombe, the initial test site was small, but it would end with most of the surrounding woodlands being felled to put service roads in to the well heads, as well as the processing plant, with no consideration for the landscape. 

There are also environmental considerations, a lot of the methane makes it into the atmosphere.

France just dipped back into recession and other than Germany noone has seriously implemented any economic reforms, the whole Eurozone looks just like Britain in the late 70's / early 80's. Even Spain and Ireland for all their suffering and austerity have barely implemented any real reforms, and then you have to look at the structural nature of the Eurozone itself, which is just FUBAR.

* only take about 5 mins each, maybe 10 if you need to do the ablutions as well;

* require only enough floor space for a person to kneel down and put their head on the floor. Anywhere but the bog is fine;

* would need to be done maximum of 3 times during a normal working day.

Also, men must do the Friday midday one in a Mosque (or, at least, with a few mates). But these are usually organized to coincide with typical lunch breaks.

So that's at most 30 minutes off the job per day. But even this upper bound is only in midwinter, and some of it can be done in the lunch break. A Muslim should therefore be no more troublesome an employee than a smoker.

A possible problem come from the fact that the more religious Muslims like to do optional additional prayers and/or like to do their prayers in a Mosque. That would make everything longer, but they still might try to pass it off as part of their religion (and hence any employer who tries to stop them is intolerant).

I once shared an office with a guy who would just pray next to his desk every now and again. No-one cared.

Now the funny thing is the only way the above would be less ""harmful"" is if the harm wasn't in our enemies and terrorist knowing what was being done but in the public knowing about, or more realistically being able to have a public debate. 

We know for the whole super injunction thing that the only result from stopping the press from reporting something in this day and age is that every knowing what is the press can't report but are unable to publicly talk about it. Not being able to have a public debate about something of huge national significance that every one is aware of is just mind bogglingly insane.

I saw him at the Cheltenham Lit Festival as well, and he did a talk about Doctor Who and Sherlock, and he's crazy about his work and all things Who. I know it sounds weird because it should be obvious, but he is the ultimate Doctor Who megafan. He was talking about how he has to ration his intake of lost Troughton episodes otherwise it would just consume his day.

On the other hand people here like you are saying nonsense like he cant play certain passes like balls played through to someones feet and through balls for someone to run onto which of course makes no sense as the technique and ability involved are the exact same.

Many people have this image of Holtby as this dog who just runs around and  do not have the foresight to picture him playing a deeper role with more moderation based on their gut instincts.

If Torres plays a great game against City, we can believe he is regaining form and confidence. If he, however, plays a dreadful match and misses some great opportunities I think his confidence will drop below zero again and that is something we really don't want atm.

The pressure on Torres has been immense over the last two-three years. That pressure will only go away if he performs in EVERY game. His name is Torres and that fact will always be connected with the £50m price-tag that came along with him. He came here, knowing that everyone had huge expectations. Not fulfilling those will always bring negativity around him.

I really do hope he performs well, but I think it is a huge risk to let him start, because if he doesn't perform, he will get the criticism again, which will tear his confidence apart. 

He's just unlucky, everything he does will always be overrated. If it's something bad, but acceptable, it will be told as if it was the worst ever. If he did something good, they exaggerate by saying he's the old Torres. (I'm talking about media especially here.) 

Ofcourse I have respect for Torres and in my opinion he really used to be one of the best strikers in the world and is now still a better striker, but he is so dependent on confidence.

&gt; 
&gt; I've heard that women are less likely to go to commit violent crimes. It's usually for things like shoplifting to feed a drug habit and therefore should really be rehabilitated rather than punished, which is the justification for giving them more lenient sentences.

For the same crime, yes, for a first time offence and for the same repeatable offence. In every category. 

* Women shoplifters are less likely than comparable males to receive a prison sentence.

* Among repeat offenders women are less likely to receive a custodial sentence.

* Women first-time offenders are significantly less likely than equivalent men to receive a prison sentence for a drug offence

Nah all he said is he'd be fine with Holtby being a CM along side a holding/ball winning player like Sandro.  Read over your replies, that's where you called someone out.

Someone said Alonso, Carrick etc. are much better than Holtby

So yeah, ultimately your disagreeing with people (which in itself isn't wrong) but you are spinning it as people are objectively wrong.  And, nah, they aren't.  Funny enough this is all coming from a big Holtby fan.

Did the suffragettes / civil rights campaigners / trade unions and other forces not achieve powerful change not through the ballot box but through other means? 

If the fact that more than 40% of people in the UK do not vote is not already evidence that the current system is a palpable failure. It's also interesting to note which groups don't vote. Is it also fair for you to impose your narrow view of democracy on people with anarchistic beliefs? Frankly, I do not care for how the mainstream describes people who do not vote. These people from big business to media to politicians have all serially discredited themselves to such an extent that I have no desire to share in their vision of continued abuse and exploitation of the weak and powerless. 

Despite our philosophical differences, you can see why someone who would only vote for a genuinely radical option (could consider the greens) does not feel it necessary to go and waste my time in support of a system I find to be utterly contemptible when my vote will be lost anyway.
