You'll notice in that discussion that we purposely avoided discussing the numbers, and much more of players involved in the system and their tendencies.

Hazard can provide width on both wings.  So could Schurrle or Moses if you wanted (as mentioned by RandomPotato), then I guess you'd want to call it a 4-3-3 again.  Maybe we want to play narrow, maybe we don't.  This system provides those options.

""Lampard can't cover""- good thing he has Ramires.  ""Ramires can't pass""- good thing he has Lampard.  And it's not only Lampard and Ramires that would fit in this system.  Oscar and De Bruyne and van Ginkel all could as well, all players who can pass and cover.  It's clearly evident that there will be plenty of rotation, and plenty of rotation is required.

Our FBs already play way up the field when we're in possession/attacking, now they would get caught out even less because of the 3-man midfield providing cover.  Cole and Azpi are practically wingbacks anyways.

You seem to have mostly ignored the tactical benefits (both attacking variation and defensive stability) that we've mentioned and just called it narrow which I deem as shallow analysis.

Let's say a hospital administrator, planning how much money he needs for next year, makes an estimate based on the number of emergency admissions he expects, the number of scheduled admissions, the number of childbirths, etc etc.

If those figures are in the right ballpark then the budget requirements should be about right. But if for any reason the figures are wildly wrong (let's say, for example, there's been a long-lasting recession meaning far more people are requesting medical treatment of some kind) then the budget is going to be way out and the hospital will overspend.

Back burner is what I said, not deny.

Ultimately though, if there is X amount of cash available then that is the limit of what can be paid for, and yes, it might mean using slightly cheaper drugs, or delaying expensive operations for social conditions until cheaper therapies have been explored.

For example, I am on medication myself, and every few years they ""upgrade"" to the latest bestest pills -- even though in practice, there is minimal medical benefit.

OK, I kinda like the minimal improvements, but is the cost worth it?

I am not actually that sure it always is.

These are the sorts of questions we should be asking -- for example, is it really worth paying 20% extra for pills that deliver just 1% of improvement?

true,EveryGoodNameIsGone,mcgann,McGann,"The way the series was broadcast, one season was made up of 5 or 6 stories, and each story was 4 to 6 episodes (on average, of course).

As each story is roughly feature length, they are pretty much all released as individual sets.

So, for example, here's how Season 1 is released:

&gt; DVD 1: *Doctor Who: The Beginning* box set (first 3 stories, total of 13 episodes)
&gt; 
&gt; DVD 2: *The Keys of Marinus* (story #5 [#4 is missing], total of 6 episodes)
&gt; 
&gt; DVD 3: *The Aztecs* (story #6, total of 4 episodes)
&gt; 
&gt; DVD 4: *The Sensorites* (story #7, total of 6 episodes)
&gt; 
&gt; DVD 5: *The Reign of Terror* (story #8, total of 6 episodes, 2 of which are animated reconstructions)

So the first season is split over 5 different DVD releases, each titled for the story arc included within, except for the 13-episdoe ""Beginning"" set (includes *An Unearthly Child*, *The Daleks*, and *The Edge of Destruction*).

Basically, you just have to have a list of what order the stories go in (Wikipedia!), realized that you may have to skip the lost episodes or watch their reconstructions on YouTube, and get them one by one.

No season sets yet, sadly. With two exceptions:

&gt; Season 16 - DVD set *The Key to Time* (6 stories, 26 episodes, one long story arc)

&gt; Season 23 - DVD set *The Trial of a Time Lord* (4 stories, 14 episodes, one long story arc)

There are other box sets that include multiple stories, but they're usually not consecutive stories (for example, a bunch of Dalek stories from various seasons in one set).

 Most changes in medication are evidence based. Without knowing the details of your condition,  I can't elaborate further but most prescribers don't change medication 'just because'. NICE evaluate effectiveness vs cost to suggest appropriate treatments for complex conditions. Now,  there is probably some room for debate about this process and the role of pharmaceutical companies in healthcare decisions but that isn't what we are talking about. 

In any case,  prescription costs aren't shouldered by hospitals once you are back in the community so you wouldn't save much money that way. 

Expensive surgeries are bring in more money because CCGs get charged by the hospital for them. You could stop expensive specialist treatments but only select hospitals do them and they are probably factored in to the budget due to return they bring in. Other expensive surgery is usually life saving emergency treatment or cancer removal and preventing that is ethically troubling and political suicide. 

Ultimately NICE do evaluate what treatments are affordable and appropriate for different conditions and make recommendations that all (most?) centres follow. http://www.nice.org.uk if you want to read more,  it's reasonably understandable to the layman.

They both thought he was too young at the time. Fleming just saw the adult Bond in him somehow. It was during on of the first plays he ever did, Fleming was actually there, saw him on stage. 

I think I first read about it later in an article done about the time he did A Lion In Winter, the film. It was mentioned in an interview he did for that again. They were talking about that play and then about his role in the film too. I didn't read about it on the internet. I was doing the play and I was reading up on the film and I came across it. He mentioned it at the time in an interview for the film and the person doing the interview confirmed that. It wasn't just hearsay. 

But that's why he thought he was too young. He was. Way too young, but later he was pulled out as a choice for Bond because of what Fleming supposedly said. I'm not sure if he met and told Dalton or if Dalton was told later, I'd have to find it again, but I do remember him being very young and very humble in that interview about it, saying he was flattered and that he felt he was too young.

I looked up his IMDB but there is so much stuff there I can't remember what play it was. I wish I could. Might be able to find that interview in the library again or something. But I doubt it's online. You're talking a long, long time ago. I was barely born myself then. If I had not been reading press clips about LIW I probably wouldn't have ever seen that. But I did. It was in there. Fleming saw him and liked him and thought he'd make a great Bond, someday, but the key word there was someday. Not right then.

Of course science is not wholly broken, but I suspect you and I would disagree on the health and fundamental reliability of such things as the peer review system.  Here's an [interesting starting point](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) on that one aspect.

I take your point about scientists not being systematically more or less courageous than any other person.  Still, I feel that, given our privileged position of spending public money on research, we actually do have a duty to be more morally courageous than the average person, at least as regards our areas of professional expertise.  

Yes, it's only a relatively small group of scientists who set out to be actively fraudulent.  In my experience it's the great mass of scientists in the middle, though, who for reasons of career expediency will twist their research interests towards whatever buzzwords the government and the funding bodies (i.e., the gatekeepers of money) say are the big questions of the day.  To me, that has an absolutely pernicious effect and means that scientific independence is now a myth in this country.

On the particular issue of drugs policy, scientists have been writing sensible reports about the relative dangers/safety of different drugs since almost the beginnings of drug prohibition.  I'm saddened by the negligible cumulative effect of these reports, but I don't regard writing these reports as fundamentally dishonest.  My comment was in reply to the ""We need more scientists in politics, not less"" comment.  In my experiences with the UK scientific community, I meet relatively few scientists in senior positions who seem well suited to this kind of ""philosopher king"" role.

I was watching a lecture by a physicist currently working in the field of cancer research earlier, and he was claiming that up to 80% of the research is bunk, and that most of the expensive modern drugs, if they work at all, barely extend life (days, weeks, or at most months).  I know that such time is very precious for people with their families, but it comes at a high cost - $150k per year say.

To do a touch-and-go you really do need a runway*, and it's important to have a real runway for visual references in a realistic go-around as well. Most airports are happy to let you do this as long as they're not too busy at the time - in particular, I've heard that many towered airports count each touch-and-go landing as a 'movement', which in turn determines how much funding they get. If you're doing pattern work, you can rack up these movements quite quickly - so the pilots get training, the ATC towers get funding, and everyone wins.

All children are expected to progress at the same rate, and, if they don’t, this is explained as the fault of poor teaching. Many teachers are being set up to fail their performance management criteria under the OFSTED schools inspectors, and teachers as a whole are facing a future stuck on low pay.

Definitely try Pickard Properties - voted Best Landlord by the Student's Union 2 years in a row, and they're a great landlord all around. Been with them 2 years and have had no problems.

I definitely agree with avoiding Parklane Properties - and Samara, too (they were ripping their tenants off for utilities readings, and were taken to court)

In terms of areas, Hyde Park is close to the University and full of student housing. It is probably between £65 to £80 a week, but beware - the rate of burglary is very high. Avoid Cardigan Road if you can.

Headingley is a mile away, but buses are only £1 to University. It's a buzzing student area with its own little centre of shops and restaurants - most letting agents are based here.

Woodhouse is a cheaper alternative and still within walking distance (I live here!) but has a reputation for high crime rates - Meanwood is a bit further away and is mainly home to Leeds Met students (I would avoid it if you can)

The City Centre (LS1/LS2) is very expensive.

Clarence Dock area is close to the city centre, and about a 30 minute walk from the University. The flats here are very nice and you definitely pay for what you get. It's also right next to the Royal Armoury Museum which is amazing!

Burley is another area to look into it and about a 30 minute walk away from the University. It tends to be cheaper, but this is generally shown in the quality of the housing.

You won't have a problem finding accommodation, but it may take a little longer to find something truly quality. However, looking in September is good because letting agents want to let it out for the year and by this point will be desperate to lease it, so there is a lot of bargaining room.

If you need housing advice, or want your contract checking, you can contact Student Advice at Leeds University Union. I work with these guys and they really are fab!

As u/ox_ mentioned, most employees are just happy to slog it out on minimum wage, and have little motivation - if you only realistically sell one item a week, your commission is so tiny it's not worth it. Most people can't take the abuse and rejection so become quite nice on the phone, knowing they won't get the sale, 

Notice how, apart from Nev, all the ""assistant team leaders"" or whatever tend to be in their early 20's?

That's because the only people who do well in the call centre business tend to rise to management really fast, and thus they have all the authority of a manager but none of the maturity, wisdom, and tact that an older, more experience manager might have. 

Call centres are sort of self-fulfilling prophecy - anyone decent or motivated either gets out there fast or gets promoted to manage at team, there's nothing in between. Thus, basically all outbound call centre staff will always be clueless, useless and lazy.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"What you suggesting in your free flowing formation is not feasible. You are already giving the two AM, presumably Mata and Hazard a lot of freedom, now you want them to be able to switch in the middle of the game? If they switch to a 4-3-3 in the middle of the game, they will have to track back. Now, how will the CMs know where they will go and where to cover? Telepathy? Radio? Smoke signals? 

The weakness of a the Christmas, as it should be obvious are the wings. The majority of the teams today play a 4-2-3-1, which plays on the wings. 

What makes Mata and Hazard great together is when they have space to operate. Putting them in a narrow field would just end up stifling them. This also makes it very easy for the opposing team to mark them as all they have to do is crowd the middle. This also takes away one of hazards greatest attribute, his pace. 

As far as Lampard goes, not being to cover is important. With the two AMs not tracking back, and with the fullbacks attacking, he needs to be able to cover some ground. He is no longer capable of doing so. The same with Cole, he would have to move up way more often. Can you really imagine him doing so at his age?

As much as I like Mikel, I shudder to think of him as the CDM without much help. 

KDB is an AM, really bad defensively. See above.

Van Ginkel, he could actually be a very good box to box, in fact, I believe it is his best role. But, he is young and inexperienced.

That leaves Oscar and Ramires. These are the only two that I can see working. 

I really didn't think that I would need to explain why playing narrow is no longer feasible. Nobody does except for Italy, for some reason Italy has been resistant to change. Even the man that made the christmas tree famous has went away with it. 

The problem with Chelsea is that they have great AMs, its just they they don't really compliment each other. 

Mata: Can't play anywhere but the CAM

Oscar: Best suited as a CAM, but, forced to play another position

Hazard: The most talented of the trio, wants to play behind the striker, probably should. But, forced to play in the wings. 

Now, that should be pretty clear on who the problem is. Mata has been great and he isn't going anywhere. With that said, Chelsea is forced to play a certain way when he is around. As much as I hate to say it, if I had to pick two of the three, I would pick Hazard and Oscar. And like Mata the most of the 3.

If Mata is playing, the only real logical choices are either a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-4-1-1.  Does it mean that he can't play as a winger? Of course he can, he played as a winger in Spain. It's just that he is really bad at it and will never develop as one (he lacks pace).

The 4-2-3-1 gives the most flexibility on who they can field when Mata is playing. Oscar can either play in the back or as a winger. Not his best roles roles, but loads better than Mata playing out of position. Hazard is obviously a winger. This leaves either a winger Moses/Shurrle/KDB or a CM Ramires/Van Ginkel/Mikel/Romeu. I can't pair Oscar with Lampard or KDB. It's about, which guy would suck less playing out of position. And that is Oscar. 

If Mata isn't playing, they can either go 4-2-3-1, 4-3-3, or even 4-4-2(I've always like the idea of having two forwards). But, even then, it just makes too much sense to stick with the 4-2-3-1. They have so many interchangeable parts and Chelsea just lacks a destroyer in the midfield.

You must contact 3, and ask for a copy of the terms and conditions from when you took out your contract. Then compare it to the latest at the link. If they are different, and they didn't contact you to say they were changing, then they have most likely voided the contract I think.

Even though scientists represent the most unbiased, truthful, fact-based opinions on any subject they are called upon to comment, they still don't have the power to force politicians to act on their recommendations or the public respect that they deserve. I don't understand how you can blame scientists for that?

What do you mean by saying that so many scientists are ""twisting research""?

If by that, you mean that scientists research only the subjects that they have funding to research, I don't understand how you can possibly see that as unreasonable. Nothing comes for free and scientists need to eat. We're already paid much less than private company employees and city workers. All the greedy ones have already left to consultancies and banks. The only people left behind who become researchers are those with the passion for the subject. You want them to pay for their own research too?

If you're suggesting that most scientists fit their research to the required conclusions rather than the other way round, then I am very sad, because that's not what I have witnessed so far in my career. Show me evidence of this assertion you have made that a ""great mass of scientists"" are compromising their research for career expediency.

I would genuinely like to hear what has made you so cynical and jaded about British scientific research. Perhaps you have actually ascended to much higher positions than I have (which isn't difficult, I am very low), so you have met some unsavoury characters on the borders between science and politics?

It would be good for me to hear what experiences you have drawn your opinions from. Perhaps you are right, and the higher up the ladder you go, the more political and bullshit it becomes.

- Marquinhos

- Zouma
- Mangala

I think if we are going to go for any of them try to snatch up Marquinhos first, this guy is a real talent. Then if not we should wait til next summer or winter transfer window and go for broke with Mangala. He might have a hefty price tag but what we will be paying for is a EXTREMELY athletic player very tough and hard to beat. He is a very soild CB and has the potential to become one of the best. Plus its Porto, Mourinho's old club. He is practically a legend their so we have a added bonus when it comes to negotiating.

There are some lovely quotes in the [full ruling](http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/56.html), though, particularly from Lord Hoffmann, who agreed with the ruling but for different reasons, with some strong words on how Parliament was giving into terrorism by passing these sorts of laws.

------
Adding to remove any ambiguity, the quote is:

&gt; In my opinion, [a broad power of indefinite detention] in any form is not compatible with our constitution. The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these. That is the true measure of what terrorism may achieve. It is for Parliament to decide whether to give the terrorists such a victory.

Parliament had passed a law that amounted to a derogation from parts of the ECHR on the grounds that there was a ""public emergency threatening the life of the nation."" This allowed them to ignore the rules against indefinite detention.

Most of the court felt that there was an emergency, but that the measure was disproportionate and not strictly necessary - this was obvious from the fact that it only applied to foreign people (the argument being along the lines that if these extreme measures weren't needed for British citizens, how could they be needed for foreigners). But Lord Hoffmann went further, arguing that the threat of terrorist attacks, while bad, did not threaten the life of the nation, so there was no public emergency.

&gt; This is a nation which has been tested in adversity, which has survived physical destruction and catastrophic loss of life. I do not underestimate the ability of fanatical groups of terrorists to kill and destroy, but they do not threaten the life of the nation. Whether we would survive Hitler hung in the balance, but there is no doubt that we shall survive Al-Qaeda.

He felt that eroding freedoms and fundamental rights (such as to not be detained without trial) were far greater threats to the country than any terrorist or terrorist group.

The way they sacked  Kenny and the fiasco of last summer's transfer window didn't help but since the decision to redevelop Anfield and the signs of genuine movement on that as well has endeared them to most fans. They have spent big, while trimming the wage bill of overpaid and under performing players.  Again there were a few mistakes like letting Dirk and Maxi go for peanuts. 

The appointment of Rodgers looks more and more like a stroke of genius. The team is playing some excellent stuff we've a lot of youngsters coming through and getting a chance. 

That said there are still some reservations but once the Anfield redevelopment starts and we start seeing Liverpool go for and pay for the really big players (think Cavani or Falcao) as well as challenging not just for 4th but 1st, those will disappear.

* Nearly two thirds of LGB students have been targeted by homophobic bullying, ranging from verbal abuse, to cyber bullying, and even death threats.

* Over half of LGB students have skipped school due to bullying, with 70% saying that their school work has been affected by the bullying.

Terry is a shadow of the player he once was. Cahill is good depth but too reactive a defender to partner effectively with Luiz. Ivanovic is probably the best of the rest but still has a tendency to switch off and also covers RB. 

Kalas probably isn't ready to be the full-time partner to Luiz and it seems like we're pushing Ake for more of a midfield role. Ditto Omeruo. They all have potential but they're not the imperious sort of CB that we need to truly shore up the defensive frailties from which we suffered last season. Wouldn't mind an older player coming in for a few years as the next generation learn their trade and rotate into the first team - but I don't see us challenging on all fronts with our current roster of centre backs.

If they switch to a 4-3-3 in the middle of the game, they will have to track back. Now, how will the CMs know where they will go and where to cover? Telepathy? Radio? Smoke signals?

What?  I'm not telling Mata and Hazard to change anything.  I was saying if you bring Schurrle or Moses on for Hazard or Mata that would provide more natural width as they tend to play closer to the touchline.  Hazard plays everywhere in the attacking third, I'm not sure how you haven't noticed that by now if you've watched him at all.  He likes to interchange and make runs off those interchanges, whether those runs are inside or out, he can do it.  He works so well with Mata and Oscar because they are also great in tight spaces and can pick out a pass.

&gt;The weakness of a the Christmas, as it should be obvious are the wings. The majority of the teams today play a 4-2-3-1, which plays on the wings.

I don't give two shits about other teams, I'm talking about our team thanks.  If the wings are weak than that is because of the players you've picked, *again*, not about the numbers on a screen.  I'm saying the wings would not be weak because of Hazard, our already attacking fullbacks who now can be more lethal on overlaps, and from runs made from midfield by one or two of our now free advanced CMs.  And again, bring on Schurrle or Moses if you want to stretch the opposition more.

&gt;What makes Mata and Hazard great together is when they have space to operate. Putting them in a narrow field would just end up stifling them. This also makes it very easy for the opposing team to mark them as all they have to do is crowd the middle. This also takes away one of hazards greatest attribute, his pace.

Well I still don't know why the field is so narrow, pretty sure it will be the same size regardless.  In this system the two have the ENTIRE ATTACKING THIRD to operate.  They have all the space in the world to work their magic without having to worry about tracking back the opposing FBs.  Remember how potent our attack was under Di Matteo, yeah this would be the same thing.  This does nothing to take away Hazard's pace, it'd be the same for him in either system.

&gt;As far as Lampard goes, not being to cover is important. With the two AMs not tracking back, and with the fullbacks attacking, he needs to be able to cover some ground. He is no longer capable of doing so. The same with Cole, he would have to move up way more often. Can you really imagine him doing so at his age?

I don't think you're understanding how the rotation would work to cover player's forward movements.  Not everyone is going to be bombing forward at once.  I also disagree that neither of them are capable of covering, seeing as they had to do far more covering in the system we played last year.  A 3-man midfield can *only* remove some of that strain.

&gt;As much as I like Mikel, I shudder to think of him as the CDM without much help.

What?  He would have help in front of him.  The advanced CMs track runners, the CDM sweeps and intercepts and tracks when transitioning to defense, all of which Mikel is perfectly capable of.

&gt;KDB is an AM, really bad defensively. See above.

Nope.  De Bruyne played in a 3-man midfield both with Belgium and Werder Bremen.  He's more than capable of tracking back and getting a foot in occasionally which is all that would be required of him in this role.  Genk fans have confirmed with me that his best role is ad advanced CM.  His passing and vision would be wasted on the wings, he should be in the heart of our midfield springing attacks.

&gt;Van Ginkel, he could actually be a very good box to box, in fact, I believe it is his best role. But, he is young and inexperienced.

So?  He has to play regardless so him being young and inexperienced (over 100 appearances with Vitesse, mind) doesn't make a difference.  I envision him playing as Essien did in this system, although he can seemingly do anything in midfield.

Oscar would play a similar role as De Bruyne.

You're highly overstating where each player ""wants"" to play and ignoring the tendencies of where they do play.  Yes Mata is not a winger and is best in the center of the pitch where he can drop to collect balls and interchange.  Hazard I've already talked about.

I like how you've mentioned all the issues with a 2-man midfield pairing for me.  Like grollcool is saying down there, Mata is the only one who is not perfect for this system, but he is far more than capable of playing with it, we are absolutely not forced to play a certain way with him.  You just have to understand the roles and tendencies of all the players around him and mesh them.

INGREDIENTS

For the custard:

4 egg yolks

25g (1oz) golden caster sugar

1 dessertspoon cornflour

425ml (15fl oz) whipping cream

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

For the filling:

6 trifle sponges

2 tablespoons seedless

raspberry jam

150ml (5fl oz) Sercial Madeira (or dry sherry)

275g (9¾oz) frozen raspberries

1 dessertspoon golden

caster sugar

2 medium-sized bananas

For the topping:

275ml (9¼fl oz) whipping cream

50g (1¾oz) toasted flaked almonds

You will need a 1.75 litre (3 pint)glass bowl.

METHOD

It's best to start this with the filling, so slice the sponges in half lengthways, spread one half with jam and place the original half back on top. 

Cut each one into three mini sandwiches and place these sideways up in the bowl (they should all fit into a single layer). Now stab them with a small knife and carefully and slowly pour the Madeira over all of them. Then leave on one side so the sponges absorb the liquid – tip the bowl from time to time to make sure there are no pools of liquid in the bowl. 

Now make the custard.

First whisk the cornflour, egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl. Then heat the cream in a small saucepan and, when it comes up to simmering point, pour it on to the egg mixture, whisking as you pour. Now quickly pour the whole lot back into the saucepan, add the vanilla and whisk over a medium heat until it just begins to bubble and thicken (don't worry, it won't curdle – if it does look at all grainy, it will become smooth again when whisked off the heat). Pour it back into the bowl and leave to cool. 

The raspberries should be placed in a saucepan straight from the freezer, together with the sugar. Then cook them over a gentle heat, stirring them around only until they have collapsed and defrosted and the juices start to run. This will take about 5 minutes, then let them cool.

To assemble the trifle, tip the bowl from side to side to make sure all the Madeira has soaked into the sponges, then peel and slice the bananas. Strain off any excess juice from the raspberries. 

Then scatter them over the sponges, followed by the bananas. 

Now pour the custard all over. Finally, whip the cream till thick, spoon it over and spread it around, and scatter the almonds all over. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and chill until needed.

Because, rightly, we don't allow our government to sent people to places where they will have their human rights breached. That's kind of the point of human rights, they are to be protected against foreign governments and our own. 

Also don't try and hide behind the statement that you're '[criticising] fundamentalist Islam and Muslims' because that's not what your doing. No-one here want to give that prick a inch of freedom if we can help it. You, however, are criticising European and British human rights legislation. Forget the context because the consequences of getting rid of that legislation will apply to all situations in the future so your reasons should also be independent of context. So if you want you can justify why we should not give a shit about human rights without mentioning this case where your happy for it to apply to Brits and Europeans as well as terrorists (because it will) then go ahead. I don't think it's possible. I'm not going to call you racist but I am going to say that you fail to see the value of human rights because yours are not threatened and you are blinded by your completely understandable and justifiable dislike for Quatada. You need to look beyond that and understand that his human rights are your human rights. If the government wanted to deport you to Syrian or somewhere else you would have the defence of the same law as Quatada but if it were to be taken away, yes, Quatada would go but you would be equally fucked. We should have some integrity and protect human rights not in order to protect Quatada but to protect ourselves. 

A solution to this cock up was available and Theresa May has found it finally. The court did not prevent the extradition altogether but simply stated it had to be done in a certain way. Theresa May refused and kept trying to avoid the court's suggestion and kept being blocked by ECHR and UK judges. Finally she has agreed to do what the courts said she should do all along at the cost of over a million pounds to us.

As per http://corporate.sky.com/documents/pdf/20c24d2e1c62406594e1a79de5f917db/BSkyB_and_SSSL_Published_Price_list Sky deems that BBC1 and 2 equate to almost £5 million in charges. Unfortunately what the hell the ""platform contribution charge"" is and why the BBC or any channel needs to pay it seems to be a bit of a secret. From what I can read it is a carryover from when digital TV was new and Sky used the money to pay for free boxes and all that advertising.

&gt; The BBC aren't happy with this arrangement and think if any money is changing hands it should be the other way. 

I don't remember reading this and I'm not sure why it would be justified. Sky do not get any revenue from the BBC's presence - they are free to air channels that are available regardless of whether you have a subscription or not. The people that consume the content already pay the BBC in the form of the licence fee. I don't see how that is much different than paying £10 a month for BT Sport, directly to BT, and then being able to watch it via Sky.

The only channels that get paid by Sky are ones that agree to encryption and are part of a subscription. The BBC will obviously be unable to agree to that. 

It is worth noting that there are approx 20 million TV licences issued and 10 million Sky customers. Presumably a large percentage use that Sky hardware to watch or record the BBC, so it wouldn't be in anyone's interests if the BBC were to stop paying Sky.

Why not? The only broadcaster they don't really pay for is Virgin Media (I think they are not allowed to charge, they are required as part of their cable licence to retransmit for free). They fund Freesat (and pay Freesat's own EPG fees for the BBC channels), they pay private companies such as Arqiva who own and manage the UK's transmitter network to broadcast the BBC for Freeview.

&gt; I just think it's outrageous that any company has to pay to appear on Sky's EPG.

It costs money to run. Why shouldn't the channel owners, who get a benefit from being on it, pay for it? As I say, Freesat charges EPG fees too - and the BBC owns it - so Sky wouldn't be the only ones in the wrong.

The BBC is there as a convenience for people who own Sky hardware like you or me. Sky doesn't directly profit from it as they can't charge for it (you can watch the BBC via a Sky box without a subscription). We already pay for the BBC in our licence fees, they should be available for me to watch in the way I choose to watch TV.

The EPG fees themselves seem quite reasonable. It's the other fees that Sky tack on (such as the ""platform contribution charge"" which equates to £5 million for BBC 1 and 2) which seem extortionate and that appears to be what the BBC is complaining about.",0,1373137032,null,0,false,0,cax4pa8,t3_1hp4no,t1_cax4pa8,t1_cax4mw4,null,1430563374,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If you've seen him play, you'd see that his link up play is not good. Its not underrated at all. Gomez just stays on the defenders back until he gets a ball played through to him. He is clumsy and isn't a very good passer. There is a reason Bayern won nothing with him up front the past two years, then dominated everything they played in this past year. There is also a reason he has been ousted from the German national team. 

We need a more complete player at Spurs. We don't have the quality players to supply him the balls he needs.

That doesn't help when some people won't be able to watch on Freeview - some people don't have an aerial and possibly not a Freeview TV.

As I said I think a cable service like Virgin has to carry it for free anyway. But if you set up a new satellite service, sure, the BBC wouldn't have to pay you. 

But the BBC has a duty to be platform neutral and denying or disadvantaging probably half of their customer base (based on 20 million licences and 10 million Sky customers) is quite a significant jump away from that.

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"Okay, so yes, Chels, City, and United are better than we are up front.  But I think it's pretty much accepted that they are top 3, and below them is competition for 4th.

No, Sterling and Ibe will not fire us to top four.  But that is not the point!  The point is they will be there to fill in when they need to.  That is what depth is.

Downing is above average.  He is not top quality, and he is not quite starter quality for a top 4 team, but he is much better than people make him out to be.  Moreover, the point is, again, *depth*.  Not that every one of our forward players is a worldbeater.  Downing is a good squad player.  A good squad player.  Depth.  Squad.  Not first team.  Reliable.  Filling in when he needs.  Turning in solid performances.  He won't fire us to the top, but he'll be there to give us a platform from which Suarez, Sturridge, etc. will fire us up the table.

If Suarez leaves, we'll deal with that.  But he's still very much a Liverpool player, and will be unless and until we decide to sell.  If Coutinho is poached, we'll deal with that.  But that is not how the team looks right now.

To reiterate my point about depth: look at Chicharito, or Welbeck.  You don't expect them to fire United to the top, but United finishes on top partly because they are there, and they are very good options to fill in when they need to.  They have roles, which are important, which they fill.  Their role is not to lead the team, or to get a bajillion fuckton of goals; their role is to provide a solid, stable foundation from which United can build an unstoppable charge to the top.  They help do that.

This is what depth is.  Depth is important for teams competing in the PL these days.  We had shit depth last year, especially in the fall and especially up top.  This year we have enough depth, and enough talent in that depth legitimately to challenge for top four.",0,1373147250,null,0,false,0,cax7omg,t3_1hrfcj,t1_cax7omg,t1_cax7i4w,null,1430561970,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

Adam Johnson was good for some things but often times he only made an impact in games we already had won. In all appearances vs bigger teams he would completely disappear. Johnson always looked To shoot before creating for others. How did his quest for regular English football by tranafering to Sunderland turn out? 

Now, I'm not saying Sinclair couldn't have been a good replacement. He never got te chances to be. He would always be brought on late in the game if he even played at all. Maybe the coaches knew more than I did in that sense but I felt he should have gotten more chances. 

Other than on field stuff, Adam also had off field activities he frequently partook in. He was known as a partyer and was known to prefer a round of beers over training.

true,CrimsonTideBlueMoon,1970crest,,"Johnson's is a bit of a strange case.  I'm happy that he is getting regular playing time at Sunderland and I fully expect him to assist Jozy Altidore in some goals next season.  As far as MC is concerned, he was a bit of a mixed bag.  Alot of people, rightly, point out that his impact really came when we were already winning and to an extent this is true, particularly in 2011-2012.  For large parts of 2010-2011, however, he was a regular starter and, while there were not bundles of goals he was always mixing it up over on the right wing.  

Ultimately, Mancini's system really only used fullbacks to add width and I think Milner is a perfect example of this: he technically plays on the wing, but he continually roams towards the center midfield is more a workhorse than a pure 'winger'.  

As far as Scott Sinclair, I've been a fan since he was a Swansea and think he deserves one more shot.  It's true that he had some mistakes when he did play but when you haven't played in 2 months it can happen.  He plays on the opposite wing as Navas so that won't hurt his chances but he does need to establish himself.  

One final note: wingers are an interesting breed and unless you're talking about the likes of Ronaldo or maybe Ribery, should *not* be valued solely in goals.  Navas didn't have that many goals last season for Sevilla but look how many times he set up Negredo.  Same for Johnson, countless times from 2010-2012 he would set up Balotelli.


tl;dr: Johnson was a good asset and Navas will be as well to add width, give Sinclair one more shot, don't judge wingers by their goals alone.",0,1373152353,null,0,false,0,cax94fv,t3_1hrq81,t1_cax94fv,t3_1hrq81,null,1430561291,8,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,8

The fact is that we were fine with him right up until the point where it suddenly became apparent that the foreign invaders into Muslim lands that he advocated the killing of would be British, at which point we decided to ignore the rule of law, detained him without charge or trial, and used the media to turn him into a hate figure.

Agent suggests that we approach the third party to negotiate first. This explains SD's constant admission that there has been no approach from LFC. In the meantime BD start to negotiate with SD direct, hence there has been more press coverage and information about this side of the story, whilst only whispers and unconfirmed rumours about LFC involvement. 

The problem is that we have started to rein in our spending on agent's fees, as we were (I seem to remember - might be wrong) 2nd or 3rd highest spenders on these over the past couple of years. This would go some way to explain the Aspas agent drama that unfolded during his transfer, I suspect we had a hand in the decision to use other agents to do the deal...

So now we are at a point where some news agencies (SSN) are reporting that the agent will not let us talk to HM; not to mention the two accepted bids.  So now we are in a position where we must rely on an agent that knows that we will slice his fee as much as possible, and he knows how to get his bread buttered...

Are you seriously saying something like that? Did you even *see* Name of the Doctor? Did you get blackout drunk in your pre-finale marathon and miss it or something? Go find a clip *anywhere* you can of the beginning of the episode. You know, the part where it's revealed to us that Jenna Louise Coleman, who is currently 27 years old, appeared as a background character at her current age in episodes from the 60's, 70's, and early 80's.

Unless you're about to tell me that JLC is *literally* a time traveler and parts of those actual episodes were originally run through a perception filter, it was definitely possible for John Hurt to fall between Two and Three, or be a side effect of the watcher regeneration that was Four and Five, or come about as a side effect of the Invasion of Time, or even be before Hartnell. Those are just some things I pulled out of my ass to try and prove this point to you, they seriously had the entirety of the show to pull from. They could have done **literally anything** with John Hurt. He could've came from *anywhere* in the entire history of The Doctor. The Time War is a massive cop out, it's too obvious and they aren't going to deliver on it. The Time War is to the 50th as the TARDIS is to Journey to the Center of the TARDIS. Nothing they show us is going to beat what I imagine.

Same with the Le Fondre rumour - it seems to me that Twitter has gone into a frenzy over wind-up merchants with little basis for their rumours. I just don't understand why Reading would let such an obviously important striker go when they are under no pressure to sell.

I am hoping that it's a winger, as that is the position McDermott has been looking for players in since the season finished. McDermott stressed how long he'd been after him and how important signing him would be, so I'm wondering if we've finally made progress on Rowe. Then again, knowing Fry and MacAnthony, we would have probably heard about it by now if that were the case.

Maybe it will be something unexpected like Billy Sharp or Albert Adomah, two players I would love to have at Leeds, although I heard a rumour (nothing solid, mind) that Adomah may have been the player whose deal McDermott pulled the plug on.

Look at Xabi Alonso, he is far from a CDM. But, he has a Khaderia to cover him. The same with Bayern, Schweinsteiger and Martinez. With Dormund, you have Gundogan who is box to box and Bender who is the DM. The only time you would actually have two CDMs is when you are trying to hold a lead.

&gt;some e-cigarettes are incredibly healthy with few long term health effects on the smoker

Simply isn't true. No nicotine containing product is healthy. Harm _reduction_ is the key here. They are simply much LESS harmful than tobacco cigarettes to the primary user.

&gt;and other e-cigarettes are more unhealthy than normal cigarettes and the vapour coming out contains more nicotine by a factor or tens for the other secondary people who don't smoke or vapour to breath in.

This is completely untrue. No tested e-cigarette liquid has been found to be more than 5% AS DANGEROUS as a normal tobacco cigarette, even the poor quality controlled batch made Chinese liquids that represent as it were the lowest common denominator in terms of safety and quality. Cardiologists best estimates to their damage were recently refined thanks to new studies, from 1-5% to 0.1-1% as dangerous for yourself or others as tobacco cigarettes.

The Centre for Air Resources Engineering and Science at Clarkson University in Potsdam, NY, for example, [ran a study in 2012 which showed there were 0 tangible effects from second hand e-cigarette vapor](http://www.liberty-flights.co.uk/blog/index.php/new-e-cigarette-study-shows-no-risk-from-environmental-vapor-exposure/), the traces of nicotine present in the resulting vapor were so small to be classified as trace amounts.

Another study led by Cardiologist Dr. Konstantinos Farsalinos and [published in the journal Inhalation Toxicology](http://www.ecigadvanced.com/blog/study-no-evidence-electronic-cigarettes-cause-cell-damage-death/) showed that vapor from 20 out of 21 e-liquids caused no cell damage or death in the first instance, following logically that it would do bystanders no harm in the second instance either - again - unlike regular tobacco cigarettes.

Please, don't believe the FUD. E-cigarettes are not harmless to the user. Nicotine is still a toxic substance however it's been up to the user to accept that risk with tobacco cigarettes for over 100 years and e-cigarettes should not be treated any differently. That said, claiming without any backup sources that they are ""more unhealthy than normal cigarettes and the vapour coming out contains more nicotine by a factor or tens"" is completely and demonstrably false.",0,1373156454,null,0,false,0,caxa9dp,t3_1hqw86,t1_caxa9dp,t1_cawzi7k,null,1430560755,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"Oh, you're one of those people. Atheist therefore master logician with PHD in common sense. Here are my opinions on the NHS to clear things up. 

It's a socialist concept pioneered post war when the nation was at its weakest and everyone needed a leg up. Along with the welfare system it is beautiful in its inception. Free healthcare for all, payments distributed amongst those who could afford it. 

However since then the 80's happened (read: Thatcherite economics) and the country became much more interested in looking after themselves and not the wider community. The old mend and make do mentality was cast aside in favour of wanting the best of everything and wanting it now. It became ingrained in the nations psyche. If she could Thatcher would have completely privatised healthcare in this country, thankfully because of how unpopular that would have been it would be political suicide. 

It is now trying to be run like a business, cutting costs and corners at every possible turn laying off front line services such as nurses to save the large paycheques of the top brass. This has left us with a situation of too many chiefs and not enough Indians essentially resulting in the lumbering bureaucratic beast we have today. It is ineffective and unreliable leaving inadequate amounts of beds and no-one to treat them. 

It would appear your solution is to go more right wing and privatise all healthcare, this leaves us with a few very large problems. The majority of the populous could not afford, certainly not in this economic climate, to drop a few grand on getting a broken arm fixed. So what do they do in that situation? They leave it. Strap it up with some wood and hope it turns out ok. But this can leave people with debilitating issues in many cases incapable of working which would mean they can no longer contribute to the system. 

My solution is to be more left wing. You start with an ideal and work out how much that's going to cost. And then you implement it, finding ways to improve the numbers and training of front life staff and cutting back on red tape, beauracracy, and middle managers. 

The issue with pretty much all public spending is one of phrasing. The Tory government thinks ""cost"" whereas what they should be thinking is ""investment"". This extends to education as well and before privatisation transport and the national grid. I could go on.

&gt;He's me, there's only me here, that's the point, let's get back...I said that he was me, I never said that he was the Doctor.

Clara points out that there were eleven faces. But there's twelve incarnations of the man known as the Doctor, so if John Hurt is still the same Doctor as Eight, then who's this other Doctor? The Valeyard hasn't happened yet, and there would be some missing incarnations if he was there. 

But McGann's Eight still has to be the Doctor, as evidenced by his appearance as the Doctor in Human Nature (as a drawing), The Eleventh Hour (as an Atraxi projection, also there was only the Doctors we know so far as the Doctor, no missing Doctors here), The Next Doctor (as a projection, Nightmare in Silver (as a flashback inside the Doctor's head, no missing Doctors here), The Name of the Doctor (running past Clara in the beginning, and possibly in the Doctor's timestream running past her), and finally, The Lodger.

In the Lodger, The Doctor projects his past into Craig's head, which *shows McGann as the Eighth Doctor*. The Doctor still considers McGann as the Doctor, but not John Hurt, so John Hurt can't be Eight. There has never been an indication of any missing Doctors.

But what if there was a missing Doctor before Hartnell? Doubt it, there was never any indication of him outside of the mind-dueling scene in The Brain of Morbius, and that would mean there are around eight pre-Hartnell Doctors, making the grand total (minus McGann) of Doctors 18, but if there were 18 Doctors then Clara would have seen 18 Doctors.",0,1373165609,null,0,false,0,caxcwh2,t3_1hqy2w,t1_caxcwh2,t1_caxccbo,null,1430559438,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Pjanic likes to play from a little deeper (I love him, he's really good, but he does not offer tye same qualities going forward as Micky and never will).

Ben arfa attacks with pace, plays direct, and has a decent eye for goal. He is a huge threat got ng forward on his day. But he doesn't offer much defensively (Micky can play all through midfield if needed) and his consistency + injury issues are scary.

a) Mkhitaryan is on a relatively low wage at the moment. He has no issue with not showing up to training and taking a fine, his contract is old and his cancellation clause is low. I'd estimate based on that he would be on about 20k a week.

b) LFC will outbid Dortmund in wages. England is also now friendlier to players from a tax perspective.

And a bonus part c:

c) the Mkhitaryan deal is being portrayed in the football media as LFC's primary transfer target. FSG would be crazy to let this deal drop over a matter of a few million euros if only because they need to restore faith with supporters after te Dempsey saga last summer. It seems we are 2-3M short with our budget, I think FSG will make that up.

This deal has too much momentum now to not happen, as can be seen now by our response to the Dortmund bid being accepted. This is LFC demonstrating intent in the transfer market.

The other positive point is that it seems LFC has a deal in place with the player, we tapped him up and attempted to force Shakhtar to deal on our terms. Dortmund said they have yet to speak to the player.

Not to get hopes up again, but I would not bet against Liverpool signing Mkhitaryan at this point, my opinion has been consistent throughout, even with the Dortmund bid being accepted.

true,Haurian,England,Kent - '10 XJ6 Diversion,"&gt;1.Due to me being 23 after passing I can only ride up to 46bhp (??) Up until March - can the bike mentioned be restricted to thar?

Under the now not-so-new licensing rules, once you obtain the A2 licence there is no automatic removal of the restriction. You'll have to retake the Mod 1 and 2 on a 600cc in order to upgrade to the unlimited A licence. There is normally a 2 year wait from gaining the A2 licence until you can take the tests to upgrade, but as you are turning 24 in March you should have no issues taking it then if you wish.  
Note that the test fees themselves will amount to £90, plus the bike hire/training if required.

And no, the CBR600 (F or RR) cannot be restricted to comply with an A2 licence.

&gt;2.Is the CBR600RR a suitable first bike? 

Not really. The RR is usually understood to mean ""Race Replica"". It's essentially a road-legal version of a race bike. For reference, the CBR600RR has won [7 of the last 10 years of the Supersport World Championship.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersport_World_Championship#Supersport_World_Champions)  
In your situation, I'd go get an ER-5 or 6, slap a restrictor on it, and ride that for a couple years. It'll have plenty of go for the road. If you're desperate for the supersport look, consider the CBR250 or Ninja 250/300, or even the new CB500 series if you want to shell out for a new bike.",0,1373175554,null,0,false,0,caxfse8,t3_1hqy14,t1_caxfse8,t3_1hqy14,null,1430558078,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2

Some counter points:

There is no Canadian model of healthcare, all the provinces do it differently. I only have experience of Ontario, but there it is very similar to the NHS. The insurance is all provided through the government, and there is only one option. 

There seems to be very little competition in the French health insurance market, you profession dictates which of the health plan you join. Also more than 80% of the population is covered by a single plan.

What do you mean ""allow people to choose their doctors?"" in my experience you can do that currently.

Your suggestion relies on ""an effective form of regulation"" what is that form, and how do you propose preventing regulatory capture?

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;It seems as though the meaning of left wing/right wing changes over time.

That's certainly true, and it's not really a simple linear concept.  It originates from the French revolution and the seating arrangements in the French parliament, when the monarchists sat on the right and the republicans on the left.  As the republicans became more radical, it became the place where the socialists and those anarchists who had anything to do with the parliament sat.  Broadly speaking, at its outset then, right wing meant pro hierarchy and left wing meant anti hierarchy.

&gt;As far as I was aware, left wing/right wing was simply the economic scale, and authoritarian/liberal was measured on a separate social scale.

That's a more modern innovation by online groups like political compass etc., to find a space for right wing US style ""libertarianism"".  The original European libertarians were predominantly of the left.  I don't really see how you can be right wing and against hierarchies, but that's the paradoxical position that people on the Internet who call themselves ""anarcho""-capitalists like to adopt, although I've never met one in nearly thirty years of real life activism.

The simple way I tell if someone is (or at least is claiming to be) left or right wing is to ask them if they are anti-capitalist.  If they're not, they are right wing.",0,1373181829,null,0,1373186837,0,caxh6xj,t3_1hr9z5,t1_caxh6xj,t1_caxh2ti,null,1430557416,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I am going too, for my first overseas trip (I'm from Australia) and therefore my first experience seeing spurs. So excited. I wonder if I am pushing my luck to want to see Paulinho play his first game as well! Fingers crossed for a Man City final, I wouldn't mind seeing Silva, Aguero, Toure et al in action.  &amp;#12494;( &amp;#94;_&amp;#94;&amp;#12494;)

I started with the chest piece and went from there.  The cross in the centre of the chest I did first and worked out.  I made the torso as a seperate piece and the back as another one.  

The helmet was a pain to get right.  I modelled it off the original 2006 cyberman and also the ironman helmet you can get online.  I actually made the iron man helmet to help get my head around the concept.

The legs and arms are still under construction but I want to redo the forearms.  My wife made a skin suit out of lycra for underneath so anything gaps and seams in the outfit there will be silver

One tip about paint is use pva glue to seal the foam as it is porous and needs to be sealed otherwise the silver goes matte.

I have lots on my instagram feed search for hastag #cyberman or #supanova

This is what I will be wearing to Supanova in Brisbane in November

EDIT: Original 2006 Cyberman as in modern era not 60's version.  The would just mean gumboots and a silver suit :D

Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than a hundred and forty-five millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all.

true,IRONic__MAN,lfc68,,"You know what? You're right. I was looking at quality more than depth, but the more I think about it we do have pretty impressive depth up front. I suppose I was just looking at the quality of the starters as apposed to how many different decent options we have if one or two of those starters can't play for some reason.

Ill have to disagree on Chicharito though, the guy is a goal machine. Also disagree on having enough depth to challenge the top 4, we may have enough attacking depth but we look a lot weaker in other areas in terms of quality, and we still only have 1 game winner. HM would have changed that which is why he's such a big disappointment. Even if Suarez stays I still see us having the same problem as last year; battering teams but not being able to find a way through and drawing too many games.

I still stand by needing to sell Downing though, he was playing well towards the end of last year, but I feel he was playing at his absolute maximum, and even then he was still only okay.

News is current affairs. Having a major tennis grand-slam being played in the UK is a current affair, a pretty important one (sporting-wise). 13 million people in the UK saw the Murray semi-final, which means that at least a quarter of people in the UK are tennis fans, or at least interested in the British contingent. Therefore, surely it is justified that there is a representative amount of coverage? 

And again, I reiterate the fact that Wimbledon is only on for two weeks of the year. This is a miniscule amount of coverage, considering that the schedules of the main channels are plagued relentlessly by reality TV shows, soaps and other rubbish. However, I understand that some people like watching it. Therefore, I just don't watch or listen to anything which doesn't interest me. It's quite simple. 

Personally, I think you should be more annoyed that year-round, celebrities are paraded on supposed 'current affairs' programmes to do a plug or a vapid, self-serving interview. This occurs regularly, usually to the detriment of covering a true 'current affair', like the current turmoil in Egypt and Brazil. 

Perhaps you should be directing your energies towards that, rather than choosing to raise your own preferences over the viewing habits of millions of people for a two-week long tennis tournament.

I never said the UK holds more credence...

He plays in the Premier League, on Sky sports he gets all the recognition a little girl could ask for, such as yourself. In the FA Cup run, he received more attention than Aguero, because he had more impact than Aguero. But you know why AGUERO gets recognition, because hes a FUCKING GREAT PLAYER AND IT IS PURE SPECULATION WHEN PEOPLE DECIDE WHO IS BETTER. 

If you say Hazard is better than Mata, I wouldn't then go and say. ""Fuck man Mata is sooo underrated and try and look like a footballing genius.

It is not fact when you read in an article that if they think someone is better, the are always going to be better, that is speculating based on speculating, something which you say is pointless. 

Also why do you think Spanish fans would say they prefer Aguero? 
Didn't play for Barcelona or Real Madrid and banged in the goals for a team most people see as the underdog against Real Madrid.  75 goals in 175 games for Athletico madrid. 35 goals in 64 games for Aguero and he won the League for City with a solo effort, can see why some people would mention him above Toure...

Toure, played for Barcelona, a team many dislike in the spanish League, there for 3 years and only played 74 games for them, scoring 4 and not really making a major impact.

Now if you want some industry insight, I.e. what people think about Yaya Toure in the Manchester City dressing room... I could happily provide that. But you may know more than me or take it out of context.

For example I and another driver both at agency rates in a hire wagon were sent in a HGV tractor unit from Hull to Felixstowe to pick up a trailer full of bananas to go to a processor at Bolton. It isn't a journey one driver has enough time to do legally in a day and the deadline meant no stopping so that is why they paid for two drivers.

It had to be done in one go as it was a replacement trailer for a load that had been rejected because it was a few degrees over temperature and the processors were billing for downtime. We had to check the trailer temperature log when we got it and phone a manager of the suppliers at home at midnight to let them know it was OK before taking it up to Bolton.

Really, Telegraph, really?  Can you not even get the single important detail in the story correct?

It was not a gas that fermented, it would have been the chutney that fermented, producing gas, which then built up enough pressure to cause the problem.

Secondly, the container _wasn't_ the glass jar.  If it had been, then the fridge would have contained the glass fragments.  As is outlined at the bottom of the article, the gas built up inside the _fridge_, therefore the jar for the chutney wasn't sealed.

Additionally, what corporate machinery are you referring to? It just seems like a buzz-word to me. Wimbledon has been in the public domain for over a century, and is rightly held as one of the UK's primary sporting events. It is plainly obvious when a topic is mentioned or featured for purely commercial reasons, and Wimbledon is not one of them. It is simply a very popular event, which millions of people wish to watch and learn about.

2)    2 percent of people surveyed said they had fallen victim to a scam when privately renting.

on and on and on it goes. 

1.    Let and Run: Where con artists break into empty properties and then rent them out as their own and unsuspecting tenants hand over large sums of money as a deposit and rent, at which point the con artists disappear.  


2.    Duped into Debt: Where extortionate amounts of money are taken for hidden costs without the tenant knowing e.g. fees for a tenancy inspection which they then ‘conveniently’ forget to inform tenants of, immediately putting people in arrears.  

3.    Receipt Rip Off: A con artist will ask for money to be wired as a sign of good faith that a tenant is committed to letting a property. The landlord will ask that funds are wired to the tenant’s friend or relative to demonstrate that they can afford the property.  They ask for proof of receipt and then withdraw the funds using the transfer details.

true,showmethefever,flair8,,"Sell:

Parker for 2-3 million, hopefully to a EPL side instead of QPR. I love Parker and rate him as a leader, but his form has dipped and I do not see him as a player for a top four club. However, he should be able to play for a mid table side and I wish him the best.

Huddlestone for 8-10 million. It may seem like a bit much, but we do not need to sell him. He is still capable of breaking into our team and he is not old and English. His passing tears apart most clubs and he would be very successful in a Fulham-like setting. I would not mind if we kept him though.

Defoe for 8-10 million. Yes, he is aging, but he is English and a proven goalscorer and I certainly think that Levy can get some good money for him (consider the Crouch/Palacios to Stoke for around 16m, 2 years ago). If he is willing to be a squad player and a sub, I'd love to keep him, but nobody should blame him if he wants to leave for first team football.

Dempsey for around 5-6 million would be good business. He is not top four quality, as much as I love him and I don't want to see him take a lesser role at the expense of the USMNT. We have better players and can sign another, younger attacking player to take his place.

BAE for 6-8 million to a French club is a transfer I could see happening. People love his tweets, but I hate his mindless long balls and inconsistent defending. I think we can do much better at LB.

Livermore for 5-6 million would be decent business. He is still young enough to have a chance at our team and I wouldn't mind seeing him stay or being loaned out. However, he has been on a lot of loan spells and has spent a lot of time on the bench, so I would not blame him if he wanted to go look for regular first team football. 

Buy:

David Villa for the rumored 8-10 million would be our best signing of all time. He is world class and can play across the front three. Put him in front of Bale's creativity and Lennon's crosses and defenders won't know what to do. Imagine having to deal with both Bale and Villa; it would be a very difficult task. People like to say he is injury prone, but that is a flat out lie considering that he has only had one major injury, which he has recovered from, and that is much different than being injury prone. Also, age is not a factor for him, considering that pace has never been his game and that finishing is his specialty. 

Mario Gomez is reportedly priced around 15 million and should be our #1 target after finishing up the David Villa deal. Gomez is only 27 and is a world class finisher. We have plenty of creative players to put behind him and I think he would provide at least 15 goals for us, if not plenty more.

Loic Remy should be available for a very cheap fee and is somebody we should consider. He can play on the wing and upfront and is very fast and can finish with both his foot and head. He would be great cover and competition for Lennon. He is the player that should take over Dempsey's role, considering he is better and probably the same price. However, his rape charges are very serious and he should only be contacted if he is cleared or we have very good reason that he would be cleared.

Christian Eriksen is reportedly available for around 14 million. He will be an international superstar and worth three times this much in a couple of years. Not to mention, I think he is ready to perform in the Premier League now. Holtby and Siggy need playing time, but Holtby can drop back into the midfield and Siggy can play across the attacking front, other than striker. This move would add great depth without taking away playing time.

Toby Alderwiereld would cost less than Vertonghen in my opinion and offer much needed cover, especially with rising doubts over Kaboul's knee. Another thing to consider is that Dawson had a great year, but is not getting any younger and probably won't be as consistent next year. It's a decent amount of money for a 5th CB, but he would provide competition to Dawson, Kaboul and Caulker, even if not all of our fans rate him. I would not mind this signing.

A LB for less than 8 million would be nice; however, I'm not really sure who we'd sign. 

Who not to buy:

Leandro Damiao is too average and too expensive. Also, after the last few windows, if you still want him, then what have you been paying attention to? Fuck him, his agents and his club. He had a potentially good thing signing with us and a very real possibility of Champions League. Now he is being linked to Southampton, which would be a great signing for them, but an obvious and hilarious step down for him considering the rumors surrounding him for the last couple of years.

Christian Benteke is too expensive and too risky. Yes, he scored a lot of goals last year, but if you want him, you don't understand how this club works. He has only had one year, as successful as it was, in the Premier League and Villa probably won't drop below 20 million. We could definitely spend that money on Gomez, who is internationally proven and apart of one of the better club teams of my lifetime. Benteke is far too risky, considering the proven players we could get for less. ",0,1373197326,null,0,false,0,caxjatf,t3_1hsc04,t1_caxjatf,t3_1hsc04,null,1430556423,14,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,14

true,tankosaurus,,Captain Cook,"I know it's only early days but I'm really liking this diamond formation. Other than that I think a 433 would also suit, but that's been the general concensus for a while now I think, and maybe even a 4231 but who knows yet.

We haven't see much of the defense from these highlights so I can't really comment on them too much so I'll just stick to the attack.

Strikers: We have a few, that's for sure, but I think we need at least one more. I'm hoping for LeFondre (sharp to reading is reported, that'll free him up). Currently we have Smityh (target man), Poleon (poacher), and Hunt and McCormack (complete forwards, basically they just work their socks off for the rest of the attack) Luke Varney is also a forward, but I'm not whether or not he'll be a st or a winger. He's great at heading too, so mayber he'll be rotated with smith.

With regards to the diamond set up, I'm guessing either McCormack or Hunt will be most of the time employed behind the strikers, maybe tonge too, but as I said it's early days, but McCormack did play in the hole a couple of times under McDermott last season, so it's a possibility (this also means we can justify having another striker brought in).

With the wide men I think we definately need some good wingers. Some pacey one with good crossing ability to feed in some balls to Smith so he can attempt to head it in, or at least knock it down for his striker partner to finish off. If we get in some good winger i'm hoping Smith can turn into a Becchio Like character like when we had Gradel and Snodgrass in to smash in those crosses.

Can't say much about the defensive midfielder spot, but it'll either be filler by Austin, Green or Brown imo, at maybe even by Murphy, who'll most likely be deep playmaker rather than a defensive mid, hence why I think a 4231 could work out aswell.

I'm sure you could get involved and that's fun. There's also the Black County museum. Birmingham Nature Centre and the Botanic Garden are pretty cool if you like the outdoors. Even grabbing a book and hanging in the botanic garden might be cool. Have you been to the Thinktank Science Museum? It's pretty neat and though indoors, I think it's a real gem in the city.

Lichfield is a cool day trip, just to see the cathedral and get some dirty sandwiches. Also, the Outdoor Cinema is going on at Brindley Place next week: [info here](http://www.brindleyplace.com/event/brindleyplace-outdoor-film-festival/). Some things are cheesy, and geared to family, but the Goonies and Indiana Jones might be cool. Shrek is love, Shrek is life, too, but you know.

There are a few different festivals going on, like Moseley Folk Festival (ends today, though) and Espirito Brum. Have you checked out Brumyumyum in King's Heath? Birmingham Fest begins soon and that might be worth giving a look at, too. 

Is there anything you're really into, specifically? There's a few five a side teams you could probably sign up for. They might be full up, but you could hop in as a reserve, maybe? What about going for a run along the canals and stopping off in some of the quirky little teahouses and cafes rather than the big chains? 

This is all pretty generic, but if you have any specific interests, shout them out and I'm sure we can all narrow down some really fun things to do.",0,1373198573,null,0,false,0,caxjg92,t3_1hpyjr,t1_caxjg92,t3_1hpyjr,null,1430556352,5,false,brum,t5_2rdjk,5

Perhaps some sort of patient advocate service would be a better solution. When you are ill it can be difficult to fight your case. Having an expert fighting in your corner would be very helpful.

I see what you mean about choosing hospitals, there are usually only a few in each area. I don't see how insurance would change that though. Where would the money to build and staff competing hospitals come from?

All the attempts thus far have been by dirt poor mostly agrarian economies in the developing world.  Even Russia was a feudalist shitpile which had been devasted by war pre-communism, was immediately attacked by a united capitalist war engine post revolution (including former allies like us and the US), was wracked by civil war and then became the punching bag for European fascism, which it largely saved the world from, and that was about the most serious attempt at communism to date.  

It didn't succeed, they paid an awful price, but they did industrialise in decades as opposed to the capitalist West which took centuries.  Even Lenin knew it was just a holding pattern, waiting for the real communist revolution to take place in an advanced Western nation, but that never happened, and eventually a nation of people who had worked so hard could see no light at the end of the tunnel, they knew the West was delivering more in the way of consumer goodies which they wanted, they were caught up in an arms race which was bankrupting them, they were constantly under attack by proxy, the country was riven by internal political difficulty and it all collapsed under its own weight.  

However, it's interesting that today a large percentage of those who lived under ""communism"" (the old Eastern bloc version of ""socialism"" anyway) are nostalgic for it and want something like an improved version of it, with much more freedom and less brutality no doubt, back.

No, I was starting from the easily-verfied observation of the quality being better, with 3D making set-pieces (like the car/ bird chase in TinTin) spectacular. You then replied by summarising it into 'a gimmick', when it's easily demonstrable with only one or two movies that it's not (something that, I'm sorry to tell you, is not down to a matter of opinion. You may as well say that all CD system ever made were rubbish because you heard it once on an ALBA £20 car stereo).

&gt;3D is a superficial gimmick that has been introduced and failed through lack of interest and then reintroduced

So you're suggesting that the technology hasn't been refined or improved in any way at all? This is the sort of thing that gives away exactly how much of it you've seen.

&gt;It's no more compelling now than it was when we all laughed at Jaws 3D with glasses given away free with cornflakes. 

I grew up with that round of movies, and I hated the popup-book effect, all that front/middle/background nonsense. From your comments, that would appear to be the last time you actually saw it - but you appear to be talking about the green/red setup for regular TV, which is so far removed from the subject we're discussing that you're suggesting a DJ's turntable will sound appalling because the original wind-up gramaphone wasn't very good.

Since the statistics they provide don't really backup what they are saying - because little comparison is made to similar surveys at that age in previous generations. So when they say ""*less* hedonistic, *less* individualistic"" it seems they are drawing a comparison without actually comparing any data.

I am curious to see what becomes of the current 18-30yr old generation though. For the soon-to-retire 58 year old austerity is just a word they hear on the TV. But youngsters know exactly what austerity means - as they have largely born the brunt of it socially (though perhaps not economically). The prolonged nature of this recession also means that for many youngsters austerity will be pretty much the only political-ideology they have known. I often wonder what effect that will have on them politically and socially -- but i'm not sure this guardian piece really gets to the bottom of it. They just draw the inferences they want with a small amount of data that doesn't even include a rural component.

&gt;While the status of supply and demand is considered from the perspective of technologies in use today, the deployment of advanced reactors and fuel cycle technologies *can* also positively affect the long-term availability of uranium, *conceivably* extending the time horizon of the currently defined resource base to thousands of years.

Basically they're saying they have no clue. Its a complete pipe dream. And anyone who really thinks there is sufficient uranium to allow nuclear power to economically replace coal, oil and gas is living in lala land. Solar and wind are reliable, known technologies. Magical nuclear reactors that have drastically reduced uranium consumption are not and betting on them is just silly. Even if they did become efficient they will never be able to supply any more than 10% of the world's electricity economically for more than 50 years.

All we would be doing is passing on the problem to the next generation.

Or better put:

&gt;European Commission
The European Commission said in 2001 that at the current level of uranium consumption, known uranium resources would last 42 years. When added to military and secondary sources, the resources could be stretched to 72 years. Yet this rate of usage assumes that nuclear power continues to provide only a fraction of the world’s energy supply. *If electric capacity were increased six-fold, then the 72-year supply would last just 12 years*.

There, in 1991, a rare right-wing government passed a law that allowed new schools to be established by parents, teachers, charities and businesses, in competition with existing state-run ones. Not only did the reform create new, higher-performing schools, it also spurred improvements in old institutions forced to compete for pupils.

The answer is you can't. You just have to look and see if the oncoming traffic begins to enter the junction when your light turns green.

I take it your from a engineering or science background and have very little understanding of economics or geopolitics.

&gt;To say we can't implement emerging nuclear over the coming decades is in my view just as silly as claiming that we couldn't create effective tidal technology or more efficient wind turbines.

Tidal is at the moment unproven but as an investment it is many times more practical and sensible than nuclear power. Wind power is a mature technology. And the eggs in our basket are natural gas, solar, wind and tidal. Nuclear power is simply uneconomical and unpractical.

&gt;but don't write something off simply because you don't understand it.

I'm writing it off because it's impractical to rely on an untested, untried technology that is as likely to fail to pan out as it is to become useful while you are, for some reason, writing off already tried and test wind and solar power. All investment into more efficient nuclear power will do is delay by a decade or two the inevitable switch to wind/solar/tidal and create a raft of resource based problems such as the French have in west Africa.

&gt;Well, that's assuming we don't find a solution

We do have a solution. Its called wind, geothermal, solar and tidal. If you are honestly suggesting we invest in extremely expensive nuclear power stations that in the hope that the uranium supply problem will somehow resolve itself then I think you may be an idiot.

&gt; may alter measured resource figures markedly.

They wont.

&gt;Well, I'm not convinced. Changes in costs, technology, further exploration, may alter measured resource figures markedly. If push comes to shove and I'm wrong there's always the option to be ridiculously uneconomic since uranium itself is abundant if not necessarily cheap to extract.

So instead of using renewables you want electricity to be extravagantly expensive? I think you may not actually know what you're talking about.

&gt;Yes, and look at how much uranium resources we've found since then. From 2003 to 2005 we saw an increase of 50% of the reasonable assured reserves recoverable

Which still means nothing because Uranium is still a limited resource. All those extra tonnes mean is it will last 20 years, not 12.

I am not so sure about that. According to chairman Joachim Watzke Dortmund is going to increase their wage budget by 40% next season and has already decreased their squad size, so I assume BVB has some wiggle room for wages. 

&gt; the Mkhitaryan deal is being portrayed in the football media as LFC's primary transfer target. FSG would be crazy to let this deal drop over a matter of a few million euros if only because they need to restore faith with supporters after te Dempsey saga last summer. It seems we are 2-3M short with our budget, I think FSG will make that up.

The same goes for Dortmund. He is their primary target to replace Götze and they also need to restore the fans and stockholders' confidence after Götze's departure.

Yaya is an interesting blend of strength and power with finesse and technique that is very hard to come by especially with enough defensive discipline to play effectively deeper. Yaya's allround ability causes man city many tactical difficulties because they're never sure whether to play him in an anchoring mikel role or a marauding lampard role as part of their central 2 (sort of). Personally I see Yaya's main asset that we lack as being the strength. Mikel has never been a bruising DM and if we don't have battling tracking back wingers we really need a bruising defender/defensive midfielder. Obviously that's troublesome for us tactically as Mikel is our anchor and Lampard our marauder but De Rossi is probably the best available(ish) CM/DM we could get anywhere. He'd be capable of doing either role, not in the exact same way as Lampard or Mikel and not in the same way as Yaya as he would probably look to pass more quickly than Yaya's Bulldozing.

De Rossi would walk into any premier league central midfield. It seems strange how the PL has gone from being the centre for strong players to having much less, even the defenders. Although perhaps that's a reffing thing rather than a player thing, a digression nevertheless.

As for the youth they have the potential but it's down to the coaching, with Jose it will probably improve but we've not been very good at making players bulk up when they join us from other leagues or from youth. McEachran was meant to be defensively orientated a tad like Wilshere but he's tiny and really needs to bulk, although I'm not sure how it might impact on his agility.

true,shakawhenthewallsfel,lfc12,,"I really think the club holds all the power here, if it's willing to play hardball. I don't believe there's any way Suarez could literally force a transfer, and if he threatens to go on strike, well...who is that worse for, him or the club? How much is Real Madrid going to want him after he's spent a season not playing *anywhere?* LFC has other strikers, but Suarez is going to make himself a pariah if he goes from biting a guy to going on strike, and he'll also be a pariah that hasn't played in half a year by the winter transfer window. 

If I were BR, I'd seriously consider keeping him on regardless of anything and everything he says and does, simply because I think that at the end of the day, although they both have quite a bit to lose, Suarez has more to lose (the prime years of his career) than the club does (50 m or so). I also don't believe he'd actually be capable of going on strike -- the man clearly has a visceral, deep need to score goals on a weekly basis. He can't do that from the bench. He might pout for a game or two, but ultimately I think between playing for LFC and not playing, he's going to decide the former is the lesser of the two evils. 

That said, if it's possible to replace what he brings to the team somehow with the money from selling him, then I'd say sell him if he's truly insistent on leaving (and if any of the teams he likes are actually interested in him, which I'm not convinced they are) just because of the damage drama like this could do to team morale, and the distraction it could become. But who would we buy with that money that's going to score 30 goals a year that's actually available? I have no idea. Perhaps two players who can each bring 15 goals is more realistic, but I'm still not sure where that's coming from. 

Ultimately, I hope he decides on its own that it's in his best interest to stick around at least for another year. If at the end of this upcoming season we don't have CL football, then we might have to sell him. But I'm hoping that won't be an issue.

edit: I do think the ""kit modeling"" bit is nonsense, though. Suarez was one of the models for the home strip, and they're clearly switching players up a bit for each one. Sturridge wasn't a model for the away or third strip either, does that mean he's leaving too?

Well, having been physically assaulted by women a couple of times in my younger years, I'm certainly not denying it happens.  But we've no evidence at all that Nigella is violent, so that's pure speculation.  We know Saatchi is, because we've seen evidence with our own eyes.

It's not idiotic to work from the evidence we have.

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"There are problems with the policy of buying youth and selling on; one is the discomfort we feel as we get used to becoming a 'selling club' but let's not talk about that now. 

The other is that you have to bootstrap the process with a balanced squad. Rodgers inherited a team with a few top drawer veterans, a lot of promising young players, and a bit of a quality vacuum in between. As the veterans retire, we are in danger of finding ourselves with a squad of 18–22-year olds with no experience.

Alan Hansen was right when he said ""you don't win anything with kids""; the MAn Utd team that allegedly proved him wrong featured Schmeichel, Cantona, McClair, May, Keane and Cole amongst others: experience in every department.

We desperately need an older forward to help the likes of Sterling and Borini develop their trades, and Xabi's experience would be an amazing asset to the likes of Allen and Henderson, who are still relatively young, as well as whatever 18-year-olds come in. Players like Coutinho will be better players (with, I guess, better resale value) if they have a couple of years training with Alonso, Gerrard and Suarez than they would just from playing in an inexperienced team.

If we buy in the experience we need right now, then in the future it should be self-renewing. And if we buy in experience at the level of Alonso and (I wish) Villa then that's the level our young players will be aspiring to. I'm sure the owners understand this.

You have visitors? What were they trying to sell you?

&gt;There's not many men who're actually attractive

Your visitor was right. See above.

&gt;I'd have to say you would be distinctly fashionable

How you drew that conclusion from the above is a bit mind-boggling, but okay. I'm no hipster sort. I just like nice things. And shiny things. And especially nice, shiny things.

&gt;I have noticed that as you get further south the general aesthetics of people improves on average

Most people are beautiful inside. Except my former Northern mother-in-law. 

&gt;I think we'd think you looked a bit funny mind

Wouldn't be the first time. I used to own neon orange jeans, and in my youth, even wore *double denim.*

&gt;The other day I saw a bloke in a cap with a cagoul tied around his waist

Tourist

&gt;and another with denim jeans and jacket and a blue suede cowboy hat

I approve of the blue suede, I wonder what /u/fidelcabro has to say on the matter though, being the King of Hats.

&gt;The '90's are alive and kicking

Yay, I get to repeat that decade of complete drama all over again. Actually, can I not?

&gt;We also of course can't stop coughing up black tar from all the smog, multiple injuries from collisions from being unable to see through all this constant mist too! It's hazardous. ;)

Serves you right for not looking after your canaries. I have no sympathy.

Yes, they are very moorish (and contain many small horses, iirc).

People turn to less mainstream politics in a crisis (coughUKIPcough)and that gives people who have pretty awful views a chance to use this blink of influence to use the people's anger for their own gains.

He had decent enough form early on, but it really just served to hide how poor he was at just about every other aspect of his position.  Even when Ade is invisible, he's often getting some touches, he's just not doing anything with them.  I'd take him getting the ball and passing it back over Defoe handing the other side a goal kick any day.

With Ade on there, we are a better team nine times out of ten, because instead of taking away chances from others, he's simply not getting them himself.

Not that odd, at all. Have you looked at the Birmingham and Black Country Wildlife Trust? I mention it because they have some cool classes, not sure how much, but they also accept, and desperately want, [volunteers](http://www.bbcwildlife.org.uk/volunteer). There's a bat and moth night coming up in August and it's a fiver to experience something amazing. The archaeology dig may of interest, too, and it's free. Uns. That'll get you out there. Both are great opportunities to take photographs, too.

I am sure you know about the Birmingham Bulls, then? You could check out their games. They're actively looking for people 16-19 to join the juniors, so you could give that a go, too. Might be fun? 

Have you ever been up to [Plantasia](http://www.visitplantasia.co.uk/) in Atherstone? It's about £6 to get in, but it has heaps to do. I know money might be tight, from looking at your posts, but it could be cool? Not sure how hard or easy it is to access from public transport, but the mazes look neat. The IKON gallery is free on the first Saturday of the month, too, so if you haven't been there in a while it might be cool. 

Have you looked at what the MAC has on for art? The [Unfinished Art Workshop](http://www.macarts.co.uk/event/va93--the-unfinished-artist-workshop-) looks super cool. I have friends who LOVE the MAC for meeting new people and practicing different hobbies. MAC summer sessions are free and pretty cool, if you want to hang out outside and listen to tunes. 

Have you spent any time at [The Public](http://www.thepublic.com/)? Most of it is free, messing with exhibition is encouraged, and they put on some cool events. It's out in West Brom, but is easy to get to on public transport. 

I hope some of this is helpful xx

I know Birmingham can sometimes feel like crap, but I genuinely, thoroughly, completely love it. If I was around, I'd meet up with you and hang out at some of the places, but alas: I'm in Estonia. There is a lot to do, I promise, and a lot of it is free. I didn't work for a few months and it was depressing being stuck in my flat, but just getting outside on a bike, or even walking and getting lost, it made me feel a lot better. It's easy to dismiss Brum, really, but it's actually a lovely city with a lot of culture and heritage. If you get out of the gritty centre and into the greater area, there are so many lovely parks and off-the-beaten track abbeys, historic homes, and nature spots. Most of which are begging to be photographed or drawn. :) I think I saw you want to improve your drawing skills; well, seriously, spend what you have on a good sketchpad and a good set of pencils and draw everything around the city.

&gt;  Andy Murray won his first Wimbledon title and ended __Britain's__ 77-year wait for a men's champion with a clinical victory over world number one Novak Djokovic.

&gt; The __Scot__, 26, converted his fourth championship point in a dramatic final game to win 6-4 7-5 6-4 and claim his second major title. 

[2012 (loser)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/18757207)

&gt;  Andy Murray's bid to win Wimbledon was ended by Roger Federer as the Swiss claimed a record-equalling seventh SW19 triumph and 17th Grand Slam title.

&gt; Murray, 25, was aiming to become the first __British__ man since Fred Perry in 1936 to lift a major singles trophy. 

&gt; Murray was reeled in from 40-0, Federer moving to deuce when the __Scot__ took a heavy tumble at the net,

No big surprise to see the BBC carefully balanced.

&gt; Andy Murray became the first __British__ male to win the Wimbledon singles title in 77 years after a thrilling straight-sets victory over Novak Djokovic. 

&gt; The 26-year-old __Scot__ asked Wimbledon referee Andrew Jarrett for permission to go up to his box in the stands

&gt; Against an inspired Federer, Murray snatched the first set, but could not claim the victory that so many __British__ sports fans were praying for. 

Surely the Torygraph loves the anti-Scot angle... Ctrl+f ""scot"", nope.  So much for being a Scot when he loses, huh?

&gt; Andy Murray wins Wimbledon with emphatic victory over Novak Djokovic.  __Scot__ triumphs in three sets after three and a half hours

&gt;  Andy Murray became the first __British__ man to win the Wimbledon title since 1936 with a stunning 6-4, 7-5, 6-4 victory over world No 1, Novak Djokovic.

[2012 (loser)](http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/08/andy-murray-wimbledon-roger-federer)

&gt; The __Scot__ could not have tried harder, the Swiss can rarely have played better, especially at the end. 

Only one I've found that refers to losing Murray as only Scottish, but arguably balanced as they primarily referred to winning Murray as a Scot too.

__Mirror__

[2013 (winner)](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/tennis/andy-murray-wins-wimbledon-britains-2036191)

&gt; The __Brit__ produced the performance of his career so far to power past Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-4 6-4 to triumph on Centre Court

Huge difference in these subheads, right?

&gt; does anyone doubt that Murray is also a magnificent player? In any other era he would surely have ended a drought of __British__ male singles champions at Wimbledon

&gt; on another break point, the 25-year-old __Scot__ brought the rally to a halt by sending a backhand long.

They really do stick to a single adjective depending on the result, don't they?

Am I the only one here who isn't sipping the Lucas Koolaid? I love Lucas but he's not who he used to be physically - I hope I'm wrong, but honestly worth a consideration. 

We need someone in addition to Sturridge and Suarez who can bag goals consistently. I can't count on Borini [yet], so maybe we add more talent or we'll be surprised with Aspas/Sterling/Ibe ?

Bottom line I just don't want us to be sitting there at the 11th hour with cash in hand from a Suarez exit and only pricey-unproven talent in mind (reminiscent of Carroll deal with Torres leaving).
