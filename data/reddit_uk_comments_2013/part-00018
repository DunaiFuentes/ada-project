The BBC on the other hand doesn't have breaks and as such is able to focus on developing the narrative without interruption.

true,ShartyMcPeePants,lfc87,null,"OK guys a lot has been said here, and everyone is right:  Our team played like utter shit today.  There was a lack of effort for about the first 60 minutes until the reality sunk in that we were about to lose to a fuckin League 1 side.  With that said, its always up to the players to give the effort and play to the best of their abilities, so they are most at fault here IMO.  However, I think Rodgers got his tactics horribly wrong today.  We only had 2 natural midfielders on for the majority of the game in Henderson and Allen with 4 attacking (basically all strikers) players. 

 As a team who wants to play ""death by football,"" we were completely unable to keep possession with only 2 midfielders. It wasn't until Gerrard and Downing came on where we actually looked like a real team.  Sure Gerrard was brilliant, but I believe it was more the presence of having a 3 man midfield that got things clicking.  We were able to hold onto the ball and pass with meaning.  Thats when we started playing team football, but it was just too late at that point.  I admit that I was excited seeing the team sheet and noticing we had 4 attacking players on the pitch.  I too was thinking another 5-0 game.  But it simply doesn't work like that.  Rodgers set the team to fail today, and Oldham took advantage and capitalized where it counted.  They deserved every bit of that victory and I sure hope they can replicate this performance against the blues.  

Bottom Line:  We can't expect to play possession football with a 4-2-4 formation and expect to win.  Not to ManU, not to Arsenal, and apparently not to League 1 Oldham either.

The din of fan outrage was such that it almost drowned out announcements of new action figures, soundtracks, special edition DVDs and other delicious morsels.
But controversy and action figure portfolios aside, this week also marks an interview with Paul Scoones, Doctor Who historian and author of “The Comic Strip Companion: 1964-1979″ which chronicles decades of Doctor Who comic strips. Scoones is also well known for his deep production knowledge, expressed through the medium of subtitles on Doctor WHo DVDs. Steven spent the better part of an hour delving deep into Scoones work with him, and now we bring that interview to you.

3) Does it make sense? If I have a boy aged 9 and a girl aged 7, I will need an extra room for them next year, since they can only share a room up until aged 10. So, I either play by the rules and downsize now, and upsize next year, or I suffer the financial consequences for a year.

true,widgetas,pink,Will Grow Beard For Food,"Small note: Why did they mention helmets (twice)? There's nothing 'wrong' with cycling without a helmet - it's certainly not illegal even if inadvisable - and particularly that shouldn't be a concern for a driver. In some quarters there seems to be attribution of blame or fault to a cyclist because they don't have head gear on. Very odd, particularly when it is going to have little to no bearing on what caused an accident.

Having said that, I do always cycle with one and, similar to not having a seat belt on, I feel unsafe without one, but I'd say muttering about a cyclist not wearing a helmet is the same as muttering about someone not having an airbag in their car. It was somewhat befuddling to see the way the media picked up Wiggins' helmet opinion (upon which he was misquoted anyway) after the cyclist death during the Olympics: befuddling because the cyclist had his torso crushed and his helmet did precisely nothing to save him from the weight of a bus.

Personally I'm more concerned about the blase attitude some cyclists have with regard to their clothing: cycling with long loose-ish trousers (actually, riding exactly like he does on his first day!) or skirt/dress that'll get caught in a chain and cause a tumble.

true,hexapodium,null,null,"Efficiency savings for free schools are at best marginal and at worst an outright lie - they fall outside of the LEA structure and thus lose the (much more substantial) central purchasing and management savings for service provision, particularly for things which have high overheads or are relatively important but small-scale provisions. IT services (student-facing and administrative both), cleaning and building services, accounting, in some LEAs catering, musical instrument tuition, etc etc are all in this category, and the move to academies has led to substantial cost increases and quality downgrades in the services which can't be cut, and cutting of ""optional"" services (things like school music) entirely in academies which weren't in an optimal position to switch over. The particularly galling thing about this is that schools were *always* free to cut loose from LEA contracts if it made sense to do so: I attended a school which did so for catering and building services (both fairly frequently run in-house in general), and I know administrators for one which also ran their own IT infrastructure. However, LEA partnership meant that the latter could still use the LEA service contract for their administrative software (which is a de-facto monopoly because of OFSTED requirements) and support, which otherwise would have seen a vast cost rise. Both schools used LEA-backed and administrated music tuition.

Both schools in question have since become academies (and were in a good position to do so), and both have since made heavy cuts to things like music, and the last I heard, they were spending substantially more on their IT services (these are the areas I occasionally talk about over a pint). 

In short, the ""efficiency"" savings that are offered by academy structuring have already been realised just about everywhere they were cost-effective, under the old organisational structure. All the rollout of pervasive academies has done is compelled schools to independently purchase services where it made more sense to contract through the LEA, while gutting LEAs of funding and thus harming those schools which don't become academies and still depend on economies of scale and LEA central purchasing. Coincidentally, these schools are often the ones needing the most attention and support, and running closest to the financial wire. Forced ""academisation"" is just another attack on schools which don't look like Gove's dream of a 1950s-style education sector.

* 2011+ VW Passat 2.0 TDI
* Skoda Superb Mk3 1.6 TDI
* Subaru Legacy AWD TD
* Seat Exeo TDI
* Audi A4 2.0 TDI
* Citroen C5 VTR
* Vauxhall Vectra 1.9 DTI
* Vauxhall Insignia 2.0 TD
* BMW 316D/320 Efficient Dynamics
* Mercedes C180D

The smaller the car (Focus, Octavia, etc), the more I'd suggest going for an estate. All of those can be picked up for under £13,000 (for the more prestige ones, you'll have to look a little older, such as 08, 58 07 and 57 plates), which is about £65 a week over 5 years, which is less than what you'd pay for a car rented through the taxi firm.

Cars like Seat Alhambra, ford Galaxy, Vauxhall Zafira? Not worth it IMHO

Whichever car you get, get the newest, lowest mileage one you can afford. it'll work out better in the long run, as less will go wrong with it.

Auto or manual? Well, the auto is a bit more expensive to run, but theres no clutch, and if you have a taxi for anything over 3 or 4 years, you WILL replace the clutch at least once. 1,000 miles of town driving a week puts a lot of strain on those clutch plates. My next car will be an auto.

Diesel or LPG? Well, LPG is cheaper, but some diesels can run on veggie oil, which can be picked up for about 70p/litre at certain chinese wholesalers if you look hard enough. Not that I do that. And diesels return higher MPG.

Why no Fords there? because from experience, I've driven petrol cars that are more efficient than diesel Fords. Their 2.0 diesel can pull, and is pretty quick, but is also very thirsty.

I don't know where you live, but I'm currently looking at buying a second car and using my current one as a ""settle"" car to rent to drivers, I can provide block insurance through my policy. If you're local enough to me, we should talk further ;)

Just remember, whatever car you choose, there will be days when you're sat in it for well over 12 hours. Comfort over style any day.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There are two *legal* points to it.

The first is that it elevates gay partnerships (i.e. civil partnerships) to the same legal and 'social' status as marriage. For a lot of people who are gay I imagine the normality of being a married couple is socially better than a CP. 

The second, and legally far more important development is that it **consolidates** gay marriage into the same framework as heterosexual marriage.

What that means in beauracratic practice is that any changes to marital rights between straight couples automatically translates to mirrored rights for gay ones. You may have noticed reading the bill that apart from section 1, the rest of the act is amending or clarifying other acts that have not **defined** marriage, but have presumed it to be heterosexual.

This (and, deliciously, I wonder how many Tory MPs know this) creates an absolutely resounding legal statement to the ECHR. The court has for a long time made it clear that the **definition** of whether marriage applies to gay couples or not is **not at all** an ECHR equality issue.

However, it has also made it clear, albeit obiter, that once a state gives equal status to marriage, it can no longer differentially discriminate between rights afforded to gay couples or straight ones.

An example by way of comparison would be:

The UK allows only Christian Marriages, and non-christian 'unions'. Marriages have several tax benefits, along with rights of audience at hospital visits between spouses/partners.

Non-christian unions enjoy none of these.


**If the ECHR** allows a state to exercise a policy discretion on what things are allowed to be called marriage, and accepts that common faith in Christ is one of those (that would never happen, but run with it), then it is **perfectly legal** to discriminate against non-christian unions.

**The above changes irrevocably when the state defines a non-marital union as a marital union going forwards**.

true,forearmy,null,null,"Apparently the courts have ruled that adultery specifically requires the penetration of a vagina by a penis.  Everything else we usually consider adultery comes under ""unreasonable behaviour"" for the purposes of divorce, and I don't think it makes any practical difference.  Consummation requires the same sex act (you can get an annulment if the marriage wasn't consummated, but I don't think annulment is any different to divorce in practice, and apparently there are no recent cases of this happening anyway).

The thing that has really annoyed me in all of the discussion about same-sex marriage is that people keep assuming that everyone is a healthy, stereotypical example of their gender.  The impossibility of consummation for same-sex couples is something that the opponents of same-sex marriage have kept pointing out... but then, there are almost certainly cisgender heterosexual couples with disabilities or other characteristics that make consummation impossible.  There are definitely plenty of trans and intersex people who could not have penis-in-vagina sex with a typical member of the opposite gender, even though they would be able to marry them.",0,1359329435,null,0,false,0,c84o25l,t3_17d5pz,t1_c84o25l,t1_c84mw1c,null,1431100288,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

He never holds shots -he always needs to parry it down to take the sting out of it then catch the bounce. Dreadful at coming to crosses- not only at making the decision to come but execution is usually poor too. 

He's also prone to those stupid mistakes like that one today. 

I absolutely never feel comfortable when he's in goals and I don't know many pool fans who do. I was at anfield on Saturday for the norwhich game and the general consensus around me felt the same. 

Coates was also poor today, no doubt, but we shouldn't have had to go chasing that game today because of silly little mistakes made from a ball that wasn't even a threat.

Jones was our third choice keeper last season, he was a fringe third choice keeper at Middlesborough when we bought him. He has been in the Premier League for 12 years but only made 60 appearances in that time - most of those out on loan at championship clubs. Middlesborough sent him to *five* different clubs in that period in order to try and see him out yet none of them picked him up or played him as more than a backup. These are *championship* clubs. 

He was never good enough for a Premier League team with top 4 ambitions, he has never been good enough to start for any Premier League team, he didn't cut it as a starter in the Championship. He is our third-choice keeper, a safety. He never was either, he fell into starting for Liverpool again because of Doni's complex situation. It is rare that third-choice keepers get starts. 

I couldn't help but roll my eyes at the threads about making Jones the first-choice. Seriously, are we watching the same player?

Each new technology speeds up the creation of new technologies. Brunel's part was when he made transport easy. This enabled all kinds of scientists &amp; engineers to meet regularly and to also correspond relatively quickly with each other via mail trains &amp; shipping. It is this speed that determines the speed of ""progress"". Things were still slow though, a scientist would work on something in isolation then share it with the world through research papers. These would be circulated and responded to. The biggest thing holding back ""progress"" was the communication cycles, at this point they were measured in weeks &amp; months. 

The next big step was the telegraph and later telephone/fax. This further reduced the time between cycles but it was limited due to it's 1-to-1 nature. Someone could immediately query a minor detail but responding to it would require a personal effort from all involved. A unknown scientist in a small unheard of country might not feel able to directly contact one of the ""giants"" despite their great idea. The history of science is full of these missed opportunities, where communication between two people at the right time would have advanced us decades ahead. See Penicillin for example.  

The WWW changes everything. A scientist can muse about a topic on a research site and be directed instantly to related work by every other person in the field. They can share ideas instantly and get near instant feedback. The communication cycle is now down to ""minutes"". Everything now runs at ""internet speed"". Things like open-source software would have been unimaginable in Brunel's day. The current level of potential collaboration isn't even comparable to the past. You have a device in your pocket that already comes close to allowing you searchable access to the entire scope of human knowledge *and* it provides ways in which anyone anywhere on the planet can contribute to it. All forms of human progress benefit immensely from this. It will one day help cure cancer, come up with clean energy as well as free millions from repressive governments. The genie is out the bottle and one day you'll be boring your grandchildren about how you were there when it all started.

I'll link you to the comment I made to explain that but also adress your other concerns in this comment.  

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/17cfq6/antisemitism_jews_and_the_uk/c84e3d6

&gt;The way it reads to me is not that he is condemning all Jews, just the behaviour of the state of Israel towards the Palestinians has some parallels with the early persecution of the Jews by the Nazis.

It's not simply drawing the parallel, but saying ""they of all people should know better"".  This is anti-semitic for the reasons outlined in the linked comment.

&gt;On the founding of Liberia would it have been racist to draw similar parallels should the new state instigated slavery of some pre existing population in the area?

An analogous example would be if an african american man ran a sugar farm with low paid, non-slave, workers not kept in particularly good condition like many other white men did but unlike the white men got an enormous amount of criticism because ""he should have learned his lesson about poor working conditions because his ancestors were worked to death growing sugar"".  Some people criticising him call him the new slave-driver.

This would be racist because 

1. He's getting a disproportionate amount of criticism simply because of his race.

2. The fact people are saying he should have learned his lesson attempts to give moral meaning to the senseless greedy working to death of his ancestors - justifying it.  This is not inherently racist (although pretty shitty) but there is a pattern of people trying to justify the enslavement of the blacks in a racist way so the two sorts of shittiness are well associated.

3. The ""learned his lesson"" comments imply either that his entire race either needed to learn their lesson (i.e. the entire race was morally deficient - racist) or they should be held to a higher standard than other races and now when that race fails to meet that standard can be sanctimoniously attacked (i.e. justifying attacks based on race - racist)

4. The implicit support/explicit validation of the arguments of those who compare him to ""slave-drivers"" - not necessarily racist but again supporting and taking the side of those who are.

5. The diminishment of the crime committed against his race.  Running a sugar farm, admittedly unethically, by low-paid workers is not in the same category as the systematic enslavement and subjugation of a race, and drawing the parallels in an attempt to overemphasise the evils of the first for rhetorical reasons necessarily lessens the evils of the second.  Playing down the evils of the subjugation of blacks is racist.",0,1359333364,null,0,1359415513,0,c84p8xl,t3_17cfq6,t1_c84p8xl,t1_c84ocdl,null,1431100864,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Apparently, for many couples in civil partnerships, this means that if one of them dies, their spouse will inherit a significantly smaller portion of their pension than if they had been married.

*So should you ever find yourself needing to take a penalty in the World Cup finals, what's the best approach? Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt, the team behind the wildly successful bestseller Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything, explore this problem in a recent podcast, as well as in an article in the Times of London.

Their findings draw on an academic paper published in the American Economic Review, entitled ""Testing Mixed-Stragegy Equilibria When Players Are Heterogeneous: The Case of Penalty Kicks in Soccer."" Now, I tried reading this article and it's as hard to get through as that unwatchable 0-0 draw between England and Algeria, especially given that I've forgotten what little calculus I ever knew. But the conclusions, as explained by Levitt and Dubner, are fascinating and counterintuitive.

Best way to score from the penalty spot? Hit the ball straight down the middle, since the goalkeeper has to commit to diving one way or the other before the ball is kicked to have a chance of stopping it, and no self-respecting keeper is just going to stand there. However, despite the likelihood of success, the researchers found kicks down the middle are relatively rare, compared with penalty kicks aimed at the corners of the goal. Why? Levitt and Dubner theorize that while the reward is greatest, so is the risk of being embarrassed in front of millions of people. If you hit the crossbar like Ghana's Asamoah Gyan did against Uruguay, or the keeper makes a full stretch save as happened to Oscar Cardozo, it's a heroic failure; hit the ball straight at the goalkeeper who saves it and you look merely inept.*

That's not Rodgers' fault, and he can rightly feel disappointed in how poor Skrtel played.

Also, how do you expect the youngsters to develop experience if not through games like this? The young players always talk about wanting an opportunity and breaking into the first team, and then when they get this chance they show zero willingness to fight and do the dirty work.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Realistically, we as a nation face a tough choice to make and we have to make it soon. It's why this EU referendum will be interesting.

Currently, the youth of Romania &amp; Bulgaria see bleak prospect in their home countries. Much like urban migration during the industrial revolution, people are moving to where there are jobs. This produces strain on Britain, Germany and France taking on more people.

If we wish to stop immigration, we need to invest in their home countries to provide them jobs. This is essentially what the European parliment do; they redistribute our wealth and an unproportiknate amount goes to the poorer nations of the EU. Here's the catch - we didn't sign up to that. We signed up to a free market in Europe, and more and more the European Parliment is devoting resources to saving the Euro instead of paying attention to the markets.

The EU has an issue because every country is still operating with itself in mind. Peugeot recently told the French government that it was 5 times cheaper to produce cars in Romania. Great! The Romanians have jobs, the french companies make money and the EU works well. However, the French government wanted votes, and allowing a large company to leave your country and take jobs elsewhere will lose you many votes. The provide subsidies, benefits etc. To these companies to keep them in their countries and subsequently slow investment in the poorer EU countries.

Politicking? There's been a great many efforts in that regard that have made it to the frontpage this month alone. No disdain for those submissions obviously. Thanks for repeating my raison d'etre - and if you manage to get beyond the mock outrage perhaps you'll begin to see my point:

What I am pointing out is the complete silence of this vociferous no-longer-taking-any-shit middle ground when it comes to *tangible* threats to peace here that don't involve shaking their fists metaphorically at those scummy loyalist chavs, etc. 

And I'm accusing the self declared middle ground of being largely made up of two groups:

- NIMBYs who think the height of the Troubles were about being stuck a traffic jam for an hour, and couldn't be less animated when actual violence presents itself a few miles down the motorway/doesn't involve them being inconvenienced.

- Outraged and intolerant nationalism which is happy to hijack the above's disdain for the much-publicised loyalist protests and throw barely disguised cheap sectarian jibs into the mix in the name of 'peace'.

Both groups are relatively silent on the ongoing campaign of terror being waged against our politically-hampered police service. One predictably so, and one because their head's so far up their arse quite frankly.

If you call any of that gloating/deflecting discussion you couldn't be more wrong. I want the real discussion to start because there's been precious little of it so far. When this incident occurred what was the #1 submission as voted by the politicos on here? A post  where redditors were leaping to the defence of a terrorist group accused of criminality!

true,TyrannosuarezRex,null,null,"Well the commentator is an idiot.  We don't play at all like Swansea did under BR and he's changed the tactics a lot to fit the players at this club.

We were having trouble scoring so he's been working on playing with Sturridge and Suarez which sometimes basically makes us a 4-4-2.  He's played 3 at the back at times to neutralize other teams.

ManU also plays the ball on the ground more than through the air and everyone and their mother knows that they'll try to get their wingers to the endline and cross it back on the ground.  The thing is that they have the players to pull it off and they've been playing that way for YEARS.  A few months into a huge switch in playing philosophy and we suddenly expect to look like Barca.

I want to add to this:  Barca doesn't drastically change their approach game to game.  ManU doesn't, Madrid doesn't, Bayern doesn't, etc.  What they do is have a style and when need be they can make a couple changes if chasing a goal.  This is no different than us right now (and I'd argue we change tactics more so than them).  One bad game where the other team scores on half of their chances doesn't mean that suddenly our tactics are terrible and obvious.  No one was saying that after the 5-0 win.  This game is what it is, a shit display against a team that we underestimated.",0,1359345556,null,0,1359348416,0,c84t38h,t3_17dz51,t1_c84t38h,t1_c84p6ql,null,1431103161,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

I thought Wisdom was our best defender against Oldham, for what it's worth - Skrtel looked much more like the newly signed recruit from Zenit than the player of the year from last season. 

You're right about the leadership point, and it's something I made elsewhere. But Agger needs a break, and that same lack of leadership from Skrtel has seen Carragher take his first-team spot - and at Carragher's age, you can't expect him to play against Oldham then be fine in 3 days' time for Arsenal. In this case, I don't think it's about questioning Rodgers' selection, but questioning the players he's selected - why can't Skrtel show more leadership and authority as a 27/28-year-old centre-back for Liverpool? Why should Coates need help against a strong, physical centre-forward? If it was someone with pace, you can understand Coates being ill-suited, but this is the one type of striker he shouldn't need help handling.

You're right that the leadership only arrived with Gerrard, but how long can we rely on Gerrard &amp; Carragher to be the spine of this side? None of the young players who played against Oldham showed half the hunger of a young Gerrard or Carragher - and if that's setting the standard too high, then let's say they showed even less desire and determination to earn a spot than Jay Spearing.

Yeah, ultimately it comes down to a severe lack of squad depth - in an ideal squad, those two are our 3rd choice fullbacks today (Wisdom behind Johnson &amp; Kelly, Robinson behind Enrique &amp; the 2nd-choice-full-back we don't have).",0,1359347357,null,0,false,0,c84tmye,t3_17dx62,t1_c84tmye,t1_c84sw43,null,1431103861,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I agree with you wholeheartedly and I wished unionism as a whole regained the subtlety 
and confidence that it once had in declaring itself happy with the Irish component of our identity. The Troubles shouldn't be allowed to leave a permanent mark in that regard. I suspect the increasing signs of Northern Irishness breaking out in the general public will quicken that process of reattachment and rediscovery.

To answer your initial question, I personally view anything sourced from the British Isles as of British origin to some degree. Gaels/Normans/Carribean/Indian/etc you can divide as much as you want but they're all components of a rich and shared cultural story.

Personally I think high and in the corner, as Ballack did a few years back is the best. Low and to the corner and through the middle are save able positions for the goalkeeper. High and to the corner is never savable. 

Edit: did not see your complaint about levitt and dubner. Like I said, read the article itself..

Old-Old-Amy could have had all this happen to her in her timeline, but instead OOA (then young Amy) is taken rather than left.

(The main point is established, but what I'm about to type goes further in depth with series 7 spoilers) Actually, OOA would only have stopped existing (I believe) when the Doctor is no longer able to go back for Amy and Rory after they are sent back in time by the Angels. As the option to replace  Old-Old-Amy for young Amy is no longer around, OOA would cease to exist.

Skrtel can't do that. When the going gets tough players revert to their true selves. Hes not naturally inclined to lead vocally, so he didn't. I didn't see this game as a chance to prove himself, but now that you mention Carra taking his place, his inclusion makes more sense. It was still a bad move. I can't imagine any of that back line is feeling any sort of confidence at the moment. 

I think you might be underestimating experience. Especially against Smith, who is huge. Coates was caught in headlights for much of the match. He really could have used Reina or Carra or Agger yelling bloody murder at him. The crowd was passionate and the opposition was pumped up, it was never going to be easy. he needs more playing time and this game showed it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;What I am saying is there is a constant ""responsibility creep"" as people add more and more functions to the state that used to be the responsibility of family. It's self fulfilling because the more the state does the more they need to take from workers.

Have a read about this stuff where the paying of Council tax and Housing benefit directly to people, rather than landlords is going to increase defaulting as people won't be able to budget.

I find it amazing that people cannot take responsibility for paying their own rent/council tax when the money is given to them directly. I don't know where the fault lies but if you can't do that what hope is there?

&gt;In a survey by the federation, which represents housing associations including some of Britain's biggest landlords, the majority of tenants said they would struggle to prioritise saving money for rent over food and other day-to-day costs.

If these were the first times that Jones had made those mistakes, then it wouldn't be an issue and I'd agree that it's hasty to make snap judgments. But Jones has faffed around with crosses several times this season, and this is the second time we've conceded a goal directly because of it (the first being Everton; I won't count Young Boys because he was fouled in the process). 

Combine that with the facts that: 

- Our back four as a whole aren't the best at defending crosses, making it more imperative to have a keeper that can handle them

- Our style of play involves building from the back, so you need a keeper that can distribute from the back rather than just kick it long

- Jones' shot-stopping is good but not so good as to compensate for the above flaws (De Gea, for example, is just as inept with aerial balls, but a much much better distributor and shot stopper so he gets away with it to a degree; he's also younger, giving him more time to learn &amp; develop). I'm not saying Jones should be De Gea, but I'm just pointing out how Jones' strengths don't sufficiently outweigh his weaknesses.

And you get an accurate enough set of reasons why Jones should never be the Liverpool no.1 keeper.

Cutting corporation tax does nothing to increase demand, and low demand in an economy means businesses have no real incentives to come here if there's few people to sell to.

I think this is an interesting perspective and I can definitely see how you could arrive at that conclusion. As an economic layman I believe the purpose of driving forward with spending is to increase confidence in the market. 

When you take the 'balance the books' approach to the economy by slashing spending and increasing taxes until total in &gt; total out, you will fundamentally reduce the total in until somebody ends your reforms. Reducing the total in, even under the premise of economic stability doesn't do much to increase confidence in the market and encourage spending by others.

true,sync0pate,uk,West Mids,"&gt;I don't think the government could ever seriously convince people to pay taxes they are not legally obligated to pay

OK, so tax avoidance (the legal one), isn't just getting advice on your tax to make sure you're only paying the taxes that are designed to apply to you, it is (legally) setting up bizarre financial arrangements, offshore holding companies, corporations, etc to make use of loopholes that were never intended to apply to you.

The government could easily close these loopholes should they wish to.

Not so long ago there was a tax loophole (I'm fuzzy on the details, but it was popular in my industry while it lasted), but a lot of workers could declare themselves self-employed (whilst *really* they were employed) and they and the company they worked for could avoid a bunch of tax. The government introduced measures to stop this, and now if you're self employed you have to be working for more than one client etc to prevent this loophole from being abused.

Of course a lot of the loopholes that are left in existence now are only applicable to or used by people who are very wealthy, such as those in power, so unsurprisingly the government is less keen to close them down.

Also, while tax avoidance is legal to the letter of the law, it completely contradicts the spirit of the law, it is ""getting off on a technicality"".

I'm both a cyclist and a motorist.  I started ""hating"" cyclists when I met an arrogant bunch of load-mouthed tossers on bikes doing one of those ""reclaim the road"" protests.  As much as I support their goals, I didn't appreciate their methods or general anti-car (verging on Luddite) stance.  I was in a car therefore I was scum and had no right to be able to continue my journey (despite the fact that I had no choice in the matter and would much rather have spent the afternoon messing about on my bike than being stuck in cyclist-induced gridlock). 

Of course, I don't really ""hate"" cyclists, quite the opposite.  But perhaps it gives you an insight into how we've got into this ""motorist vs cyclist"" spat.  When a pro-cycling person such as myself is turned off by the antics of the hard-core cycle brigade, then I can only imagine what it's doing to those who worship at the altar of Jeremy Clarkson.  

Similarly, when someone like Clarkson is a figurehead for motorists, it's easy to see why they get a bad name too.  As usual, it's the extremists that shout the loudest and seek to polarise people's views.

If we stay in the EU it *has* to be with the view towards a real move to democratic Federalisation rather than the slightly unilateral federalisation we have now.  A lot of the problems EU sceptics have with the current system would be addressed in a USA style EU state system. They of course still wouldn't want it because the core issue here is that they are clinging to the an idea of an identity that I feel is outdated. 

We are done as our own major power and if we insist on a rose tinted view of our self's that makes it seem like we have hope of influence in the world out side the EU power block we are deluded. My feeling is that the next 100 years is going to be a powder keg and any one not in a major block is risking being crushed between them when they clash.

If the worst doesn't happen I also believe that we can do more as part of a fully fledged EU than we can on our own. The core values of the EU are worth protecting and exporting in to the world and they are values that we all commonly share.

What people need to understand is that being part of a United Sates of Europe does not have to come with the sublimation of our current state identity. We can both be British and European as they are not a mutually exclusive scale. Just look to the USA, people have both a National and a Sate identity and they can be both equally important (or not) to the people who hold them.

She said that she's never been made to feel so insignificant and small in her life. The people processing her application were very condescending. It costs a lot of money to apply for citizenship, fill out tonnes of forms, and you have to pay for the test book and the test.

She studied really hard and got 100%. They've asked her to come back and help reshape future tests.

She told them to go jump.

I'm no manager but when managers take blame the players almost get a free pass and feel minimal responsibility. But when managers pass the blame downward, at worse it demands more from the players - which isn't a bad thing. Where the manager is clearly at fault, the players will known and it will be dealt with internally and he is fired or passed on.

By identifying the weaknesses in the performance and not talking about taking blame - he did the most efficient thing which benefited the team.

true,ezekielziggy,eng-sussex,Sussex,"""There is no point being in public life unless you seek, as honestly as you can, to address the big problems facing the country and make a stand for policies you genuinely believe will make society better, free from outdated dogma. This is the lesson I learned from my two political mentors, Roy Jenkins and Tony Blair, with both of whom I worked closely and admired greatly, not only for their political skills but for their enduring values and their courage as progressive reformers and leaders. Tony Blair’s motto was “the best policy is the best politics,” and I can’t think of a better one.

So forgive me if I am not all motherhood-and-apple-pie this evening. I want, if I may, to tackle two of the biggest challenges which face us in education today.
The first challenge is not simply to reduce the number of underperforming comprehensives – where we have made reasonable progress in the last decade – but to eradicate them entirely, replacing them with successful all-ability academies.

The second challenge is to forge a new settlement between state and private education in England.

I put these two challenges together because they go together. It is my view, after 20 years of engagement with schools of all types, that England will never have a truly world class education system until state and private schools are part of a common national endeavour to develop the talents of all young people to the full and build a “one nation” society instead of the “them and us” of the past.

My experience as a reformer has also taught me that almost all the best solutions to big challenges are simple. Complexity comes in trying to avoid or qualify the simple solution because it is unpalatable. You of course need to be simple and right, not simple and wrong; and a good deal of research and experience – and where appropriate, piloting of policy – needs to go into getting to the right simple solution. Simple doesn’t mean simplistic. Nor does simple mean easy. It means getting to the heart of the problem, and making the fundamental change which makes a fundamental difference.

So just as the challenge is simple – how to unite state and private schools in a common endeavour – I believe the solution is also simple. Every successful private school, and private school foundation, should sponsor an academy or academies, in place of existing underperforming comprehensives. They should do this alongside their existing fee-paying school or schools, turning themselves into federations of private and state schools, following the lead of a growing number of private schools and their foundations which have done precisely this and would not think of going back, including Dulwich, Wellington, the Haberdashers, the Mercers, the Girls Day School Trust, the City of London Corporation and the King Edward VI Foundation in Birmingham.

And by sponsoring academies I don’t just mean advice and assistance, the loan of playing fields and the odd teacher, etc. I mean the private school or foundation taking complete responsibility for the governance and leadership of an academy or academies, and staking their reputation on their success as they currently do on the success of their fee-paying schools.

For the private sector, I set this totally apart from the opening up of more places in existing private schools to those who can’t pay the fees. This is a good thing for private schools to do to make themselves less socially exclusive, but it does nothing to create more good schools, let alone to breach the educational Berlin Wall between private and state education.

To leaders in the state sector, I put this forward as a complementary – not an alternative – policy to the brilliant job that so many successful state school leaders and organisations are doing in establishing academies. We need many more good academy sponsors from all successful parts of the education system – state schools, private schools, universities, and educational foundations – and we need them to learn from each other and collaborate.

I want to develop the argument for this new state-private settlement in some depth, because the forces against progress are deeply entrenched in both the state and the private sectors of education, mirroring prejudices on the Left and Right of politics which go back decades if not generations.

Over the entire second half of the 20th century, these prejudices made it exceptionally hard to do more than fiddle around at the margins of state-private partnership. This, in turn, bred a deep fatalism which is with us still. Everyone knows that the status quo is terrible – rigid separation between most of the nation’s most privileged and powerful schools and the rest. Yet no-one has a credible plan or will to do much about it except say how bad it is, why it’s someone else’s fault, and why it will never change because, well, this is England, it’s deep and cultural, and it all began with Henry VIII. It’s the same fatalism which greeted gridlock in central London before the congestion charge, hospital waiting lists before patients’ rights, and rain stopping play at Wimbledon before the roof.

The call now is for activists not fatalists. The future doesn’t have to be like the past. There is no reason whatever why the Berlin Wall between the state and private sectors of English education cannot be brought down fairly quickly, if every private school and private school foundation sponsors an academy or academies, running independent schools in the state-funded as well as the fee-paying sectors, immersed in promoting excellent education for the least well-off as well as the best-off in society, and progressively combining the best of both.

To develop the argument, let me say more at the outset about underperforming comprehensives on the one hand, and private education on the other, before addressing the fundamental relationship between the two.

On underperforming schools, we still have far too many of them. Where they are not improving rapidly, every year, they should be replaced by academies. My ambition from the moment that academies started to prove themselves successful was to replace the entire bottom half of the comprehensive system with academies, unless the schools were improving rapidly. I didn’t put it quite like this at the time, not wanting to be burned in effigy by my admirers in the Anti-Academies Alliance even more frequently outside Sanctuary Buildings, but I don’t think my direction of travel was much of a secret.

By academies, I of course mean “sponsored academies.” The whole purpose of academies, in respect of underperforming schools, is completely to replace existing governance and local authority control with new independent sponsors, untainted by past failure, who demonstrate the capacity and ambition to create excellent all- ability schools. For this, a large number of outstanding sponsors are needed, able to manage perhaps a thousand more secondary academies.

Let me say therefore that I entirely support the Government’s decision to raise the floor of minimum performance – the proportion of pupils in a school gaining five or more good GCSESs including English and maths – from 35% to 40% per cent next year, and then to 50% in 2015. Michael Gove was absolutely right to say, a fortnight ago, that “there is no reason, if we work together, that by the end of this parliament every young person in the country can’t be educated in a school where at least half the students reach this basic academic standard.”

I also welcome Liz Sidwell’s appointment as Schools Commissioner to help bring this about. From her years leading the Haberdashers’ academy federation, no-one knows better than Liz how to bring sponsored academies into being, and how to harness their potential to drive the fundamental reinvention of secondary education in areas where comprehensives have basically failed in the past. She also knows a thing or two from the Haberdashers about state/private partnership in academies.

This is a moral cause. But it is also an economic imperative. As Michael Gove also pointed out, 80 per cent of students in Singapore already get above a similar threshold of five O levels including English and maths (they still sit Cambridge board O levels in Singapore). It was visits to schools in Singapore, Finland, Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2007, where I saw not only near uniformly high standards but also a relentless drive to raise them still further, that transformed my thinking on the scale of the task we face in England. I gave a lecture shortly afterwards suggesting that we needed by 2020 to become an “80 per cent” education system – by which I meant at least 80 per cent of 16 year-olds reaching a basic baccalaureate standard. At the moment we are at just over 50 per cent. But we can’t really wait until 2020 to be as good as Singapore and Finland today, so it is not incremental change but step change that is needed.

I say this in full recognition of the great progress that has been made in recent years by headteachers and teachers nationwide, all the more impressive when one considers the state of the education system only a generation ago.

Fifteen years ago, a staggering half – half – of all comprehensives weren’t even getting a third of their pupils above the five good GCSE level including English and maths. This wasn’t entirely surprising when two-thirds of 11 year-olds, in the first national SATs tests in 1995, were found not to be reaching an adequate standard in the three Rs.

I still shudder to think of my visit to a comprehensive in Sunderland a few years ago where the previous summer only fifteen 16-year-olds had got to the five good GCSE level including English and maths, and a local authority official said to me: “Lord Adonis, you need to understand that they used to leave here, go down the hill, and turn left to go into the shipyards, or turn right to go down the mines, but now there aren’t any jobs so they might as well walk straight into the sea.” That school is now closed and replaced by an academy sponsored by the University of Sunderland and a local hi-tech company.

It was on visits like this that I also came to understand why things were so bad, because of the secondary-modern antecedents of so many comprehensives, including that one. When people talked of the comprehensive revolution, this was in fact a misnomer. Across most of the country there was no comprehensive revolution, just a continuation of the secondary moderns. In the early 1960s there were 3,700 secondary moderns and only 1,200 grammar schools. One way and another more than a quarter of the grammar schools stood apart from the comprehensive reform, including most of the most prestigious and successful grammar schools which went private rather than be abolished. So across most of the country, comprehensives were simply the former secondary moderns with a new sign outside, and a few prefab buildings or portacabins to accommodate the raising of the school leaving age to 16 in 1972.

As for what this meant, the single most depressing but revealing book I read when trying to get to grips with the nature of our educational crisis was a 1967 study of the secondary modern school by David Hargreaves, who most of you know for his inspiring writing and his stint as head of the national qualifications and curriculum agency a decade ago. It was the fruit of a year which David, then a young researcher, spent at a secondary modern in Salford Docks. He described the secondary modern as pretty standard for a working class community in the mid-Sixties. In one key respect – the school had new buildings – it was better than standard. Yet the description of the school is unremittingly grim. Most of the boys at the school took no external exams at all and gained no qualifications whatsoever. Only a minority even in the top stream of the school were even entered for a local school leaving certificate, for which cheating was widespread among staff and pupils. The new national CSE exam was coming in – a much inferior form of O-level – but there was no encouragement from the headteacher or most of the teachers for even the brightest pupils to stay at school beyond the minimum leaving age of 15 to take it. As for O- levels, Hargreaves wrote:

Only one member of staff felt strongly that even the best boys, in the top stream, were of sufficient ability to take O-level; most of the other teachers of the higher streams took the view that … to enter them for O-level would be to mislead the pupils with hopes of academic success beyond their powers. There is also little doubt that some of these teachers were reluctant to teach to O-level since they had never done so and were uneasy about their competence to do so.

As for the wider ethos of the school:

Lessons and exams were treated with contempt by most of the boys. … For many of the teachers and most of the pupils life at the school was a necessary evil. Life was directed towards a reduction of potential conflict by a minimal imposition of demands one upon the other. If the upper streams passed their [school leaving] exam and the lower streams did not riot, the school was for most teachers succeeding.

By this yardstick, even the worst comprehensives in the 1990s were an improvement.

Understanding the past made me all the more alive to the immensity of the challenge to overcome it, a challenge of community transformation as much as educational reform. But it also made – and makes – me all the more radical in seeking solutions which measure up to the immensity of the challenge. Hence academies.

So we are making progress, but there is so much further to go. For example, half of the city of Birmingham’s 75 secondary schools – half – are still not achieving five good GCSEs including English and maths for half their pupils. Birmingham boasts some of the best private and state schools in the country, yet it still has a long tail of seriously underperforming schools. It should be no surprise that Birmingham’s unemployment is twice the national average; that its workforce skill levels are among the lowest in the country; and that it still only has seven sponsored academies open or in the pipeline. And I could tell a similar story about many other parts of the country.

Now let me turn to the private sector.

The debate about private education in England encompasses two different private sectors. There is the private profit-making sector. And there is the private charitable sector.

There is a growing debate as to whether we should follow Sweden and parts of the United States, among others, and allow private profit-making companies to run state-funded schools. I am opposed to this. When Minister, I said to the private profit-making companies wanting to set up in England that they should sponsor academies philanthropically, and if they could demonstrate great success, then they might be able to make a case. None has yet done so.

true,ezekielziggy,eng-sussex,Sussex,"It is true that in the much-cited case of Sweden, commercial operators have been a major force behind free schools. But I would make two comments about this. First, the experience has been problematic. Sweden has faced a number of recent scandals around profit-taking from commercially-run state funded schools. The Swedish education minister recently announced an enquiry into how free schools which fail to meet accepted standards can be prevented from taking out profits.

Secondly, the position in England is fundamentally different. When Sweden embarked on free schools, it had a weak private charitable school sector. England, by contrast, has one of the largest, and possibly the very strongest private charitable school sector in the world. Both of our major churches are large-scale school sponsors, in the private and the state sectors; and the great majority of our private schools – and all of the historic private school foundations which dominate the private school elite – are historic charities. The private sector which can make a big difference to English state education isn’t the private commercial sector but the private charitable sector. We need to focus on the whale not the minnow.

Let’s look first at the statistics. Dwell not on the seven per cent of school age pupils who go to private schools, which is the most misleading of the stats. More revealing is the 18 per cent of full-time students over the age of 16 who are at private schools. The one in three of A grades in A-level physics, chemistry and history which go to private school students, earning them a similar proportion of places in most Russell Group universities and half of all places at Oxford and Cambridge.

Stop there for a moment: that’s 8,000 ex-private school students at Oxbridge, compared to a mere 130 students at Oxbridge who, at school, were eligible for free school meals. So 130 Oxbridge students are drawn from the poorest 13% of secondary school pupils, while 8,000 – sixty times as many – are drawn from the most privileged seven per cent. No surprise then, those Sutton Trust reports which tell us that three in four judges, two in three top barristers, and half of leading company chief executives, solicitors, journalists and politicians were educated at private schools. Sport, drama, TV, and both pop and classical music are also largely dominated by the private schools.

England in 2011 is governed by a Prime Minister educated at Eton, a Deputy Prime Minister from Westminster, a Chancellor from St Paul’s. Charterhouse, Rugby, Radley, Wellington and Cheltenham Ladies College are all in the Cabinet too, along with a second from Westminster; almost all of them children of very wealthy parents. We do indeed have a coalition government – a coalition between Eton and Westminster. It is only a slightly broader coalition which funds, manages and entertains the country too.

Seen in this way – the dominance of a privately educated elite over the social, economic and political life of this country – you realise why it is so important, if we are ever to be one nation, to have the people who run the private schools, and who teach in and attend these schools, engaged institutionally and intimately with state education too.

Let me also say a word about the teaching profession. Back in the 1970s, the pupil:teacher ratio in private schools wasn’t much different than in state schools. Now, on the back of fees which have doubled in real terms in a little over twenty years, the private school ratio is about half that in state schools. 14 per cent of the nation’s teachers are in private schools, and a far higher proportion of teachers with better and higher degrees. Moreover, a recent report by the Centre for the Economics of Education notes that by far the single largest source of new teachers in private schools is experienced teachers in state schools, whereas traffic the other way is minimal. To put this in perspective, the excellent Teach First scheme, which as a Minister I did everything in my power to promote (including signing very large cheques) because of its significance in strengthening the link between the top universities and the state teaching profession, will this year recruit 800 graduates into state schools. A great achievement. Yet according to Centre for the Economics of Education data for 2006, there was a net recruitment – after transfers the other way – of 1,400 experienced teachers from state schools into private schools in that year alone.

How did it all come to be like this? Like the secondary modern antecedents of the comprehensives, the Victorian antecedents of today’s private schools are highly illuminating. Historians of education talk a lot about Gladstone’s 1870 Education Act, which essentially started state education. But equally significant were Gladstone’s 1869 and 1873 Endowed Schools Acts, which essentially turned the great public schools – and many of the newer grammar schools – previously run in a rackety way by Crown, church or local appointees, into a Victorian equivalent of academies, with new independent governing foundations to control their assets, management and leadership. This Victorian academy status greatly strengthened the private schools as institutions, but their fees, and the conservative use of their charitable assets by their new governing bodies, kept most of them largely closed to all but the upper and upper middle classes, and they remained so as the state secondary system developed in the decades after the 1902 Balfour Education Act.

There was a moment, at the end of the Second World War, when history might have taken a different turn. An official report, published in 1944 on the day Eisenhower reviewed his bridgehead in Normandy, said the social division between private and state schools “made far more difficult the task of those who looked towards a breaking down of those hard-drawn class distinctions within society.” Churchill himself, visiting his alma mater of Harrow, talked to the boys of “broadening the intake and the public schools becoming more and more based on aspiring youth in every class of the nation.”

But it didn’t happen. Sixty-six years after the war, the only significant changes to the private school system are that it is larger, richer, and its average educational attainment has risen to among the highest in the world.
This is because during the whole period since the war, Labour and Tory governments alike have adopted a simple one word policy in respect of private schools: isolationism.

On the Labour side, ideological antipathy to fee-paying education, and later also to selective education, bred hostility. But the social and legal position of the private schools, plus – ironically – the personal educational preferences of Labour leaders from Attlee to Wilson, kept at bay any attack beyond the rhetorical, except for the withdrawal of state funding schemes for small numbers of pupils to attend private schools, which the 1974 Labour government did in respect of the direct-grant scheme introduced by Butler in 1944, and the 1997 Labour government did in respect of the Assisted Places Scheme introduced by Margaret Thatcher in 1980.

I particularly treasure Roy Jenkins’s exchange with Harold Wilson when turning down Wilson’s offer to become Education Secretary in 1965. In his memoirs Roy doesn’t say why he turned the job down: he told me it was because he regarded Education as a second order department and he had no idea of a constructive education policy to pursue, itself a telling commentary on the state and status of education at the time. But here is his exchange with Wilson, as recorded in his memoirs. “Looking for an excuse [to decline the job], I said that all three of our children were at fee-paying schools and that this surely was an obstacle to being Minister of Education in a Labour government. Wilson brushed this aside as being of no importance. “So were mine,” he said.”

Under Tony Blair – Durham Cathedral School, Fettes, St John’s College Oxford – any undermining of the private schools was equally out of the question. Instead there was friendly waffle about mutual respect; and some committees and minor partnership projects which did not a lot. That is, until academies, of which more hereafter.

On the Tory side, there was an equal and opposite isolationism. Partly this was a matter of letting sleeping dogs lie. Most Tory ministers and MPs went to private schools and sent their children to them. So long as Labour kept the dogs off, they had no desire to court controversy by proposing any expanded role for the private sector. On the Tory left, epitomised by the Etonian Sir Edward Boyle, education minister under Macmillan and Douglas-Home, two more Etonians, there was also a dose of patrician guilt and support for comprehensivisation, provided it didn’t affect the private schools.

However, for the Tory mainstream, the major concern was about dilution. The dominant view was “more means worse”: the view that there were only a small, and pretty fixed, number of “good” schools, mostly existing private schools and the remaining grammar schools, and they needed to be preserved in aspic. This secured, the only safe and politically viable Tory reform in respect of private schools was to open up a tiny number of places in private day schools to children with poorer parents. Hence the assisted places scheme which with much fanfare paid private school fees for 30,000 children out of a private school sector of 500,000 children and a state school sector of more than 8 million. Not so much an education policy as escapology.

So much for the politicians. The leaders of state and private schools were – and many of them remain – similarly isolationist. It was an article of faith among the leaders of the comprehensive movement that private schools were not only socially divisive but also, in respect of educational practice, largely irrelevant. This remains a pronounced view, even among some of my friends who run academies. They say, to paraphrase: “what can that lot who just spoon feed the children of the rich ever know about education in Hackney and Knowsley.” As for the heads of the private schools, many of them have been only too eager to agree, when the suggestion is made that they might manage state-funded academies. Pressed further, they often say it’s not about ordinary children versus privileged children but about non-selective schools versus selective schools, a view put to me recently by the chair of governors of one of our great public boarding schools, which I found richly ironic, given that until recently his school was basically an all-ability comprehensive for the rich and titled.

This mutual isolationism didn’t matter much until now, because there was no opportunity for systematic and deep engagement between the two sectors. Now it matters a lot, because before us, if we seize it, is a simple, radical and workable agenda to end the isolationism of the past. It is for every successful private school and private school foundation to sponsor an academy or academies, and transform themselves into state-private school federations.

The arguments of principle are manifold and manifest. We will never build a one nation society unless we eradicate failing schools and systematically leverage our most powerful social leaders and our best educational institutions in the service of the wider community. That means many more good schools, replacing underperforming comprehensives community by community. Academies – independent state schools – are now proven as the successful institutional means of harnessing our most powerful social leaders and best educational institutions in the management of new schools. So we need many more such academies.

Successful private schools ought to be prominent among the sponsors for the next wave of academies. Everything about academies is in the DNA of the successful private school: independence, excellence, innovation, social mission. And the benefit is not only to the wider community, it is also to the private schools themselves, whose mission is enlarged, whose relative isolation is ended, and whose social engagement, beyond the families of the better-off, is transformed.

Let me deal with some of the concerns. To those on the Left, and in the state and academy sectors, who see private schools as an irrelevance, I hope I have said enough about their huge footprint in almost every national elite to show why the isolationism of the past cannot continue if opportunity is to be for the many not the few.

To those in the private schools, and their governing bodies, who are reluctant to embrace academies, I appeal both to their professionalism and to their moral and charitable missions. It was excusable to stand apart from state-funded education when the state and its leaders did not want you engaged in the first place. But that is the isolationist politics of the past. The politics of the present and the future is that the nation seeks your engagement in setting up new independent state-funded academies in a way which does not compromise your independence, and which renews for the 21st century your essential moral and charitable purposes.

Let me say a few more words about these charitable purposes. William of Wykeham established Winchester for the education mainly of poor scholars, and only a minority of “noble commoners”. Henry VI set up Eton for poor scholars. Charterhouse was established by Sir Thomas Sutton, the wealthiest commoner in England, for – yes, more poor scholars. Elizabeth I endowed Westminster School for the same purpose; to this day it is an integral part of Westminster Abbey, its governing body chaired by the Dean of Westminster appointed by The Queen. John Lyon set up Harrow in 1572 as a free grammar school for the education of boys of the parish of Harrow, and the parish objected strongly when the Endowed Schools Act removed this obligation. I could go on and on, but you get the gist. The governors of these great educational charities should look honestly to their charitable purposes. If they do, I believe it is hard for them to conclude that a few more bursaries here and there are enough, when they could be running new schools serving the very missions for which their assets were intended in the first place.

As for the idea that these great schools are not capable of making a success of academies with more challenging pupil intakes, this is a comic proposition. The Governing Body of Eton is chaired by my distinguished colleague in the Lords, and former Minister, William Waldegrave. Its members include three professors, three knights, five PhDs, and the former Private Secretary to the Prince of Wales. The Dean of Westminster, who chairs Westminster School’s Governing Body, is my good friend John Hall, the former chief education officer of the Church of England, who was the driving force behind the C of E’s decision to set up more than 30 academies. His fellow governors include the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, two professors, two canons, two knights, one baron and one dame.

Every public school governing body in the country is a catalogue of the very great and the very good, including eminent business and educational leaders. The idea that these organisations, if they have the will to do so, cannot command the resources and the expertise needed to run a successful school or schools in less advantaged areas – well, if that were true, then England would indeed be Greece, about to default on its whole society not just its government borrowing.

But there is no need to argue only by assertion. Just look at those who are taking a lead, and see the movement for change which is gathering pace. Dulwich is successfully sponsoring an academy in Sheppey. Wellington is successfully sponsoring an academy in Wiltshire. The King Edward VI Foundation is successfully sponsoring an academy in Birmingham, alongside its two private schools and five state grammar schools. All of these academies replace failing comprehensives. The Girls Day School Trust has converted two of its outstanding private schools, in Liverpool and Birkenhead, into state academies.

Three of the most impressive academy chains – built up by the Mercers Company, the Haberdashers Company, and the City of London Corporation – have grown out of the management of historic private schools, leveraging this educational expertise and experience to establish chains of academies alongside.

true,ezekielziggy,eng-sussex,Sussex,"The City Corporation, historic sponsors of the City of London Schools for Boys and Girls, and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, now sponsors three academies in its neighbouring boroughs on Islington, Southwark and Hackney. David Levin, the headmaster of the City of London School for Boys, and this year’s Chairman of the Headmasters’ Conference, in a highly constructive speech last week in Guildhall, suggested that fellow HMC schools might start sponsoring primary-level academies. I welcome this, but why stop at primary academies? HMC schools are secondary schools; it is secondary education they know best and where they can make most difference. Never go for the smaller reform option simply because it is smaller, is another of my maxims.

The Mercers, historic managers of St Paul’s Girls and St Paul’s Boys Schools, now sponsor an academy nearby in West London, and a chain of academies growing out of the Mercers’ outstandingly successful Thomas Telford School – one of the original City Technology Colleges – in Telford.
The Haberdashers, with their historic private schools in Elstree and Monmouth, now have two clusters of successful academies, one in Lewisham and the other in Telford. A fortnight ago I spoke at the Haberdashers’ Annual Education Dinner in their magnificent new livery company hall next to Barts, alongside the Earl of Wessex, a Haberdasher. The heads and many of the governors and staff of the Haberdashers academies and the private schools were there, discussing their work together and their plans for the future. Each year all new pupils from all the schools visit Haberdashers Hall. For an eleven year old, it must be a truly awe-inspiring experience.

A month ago I was at Wellington Academy in Wiltshire, speaking alongside Anthony Seldon, the Master of Wellington College, at a joint conference of the staff of both Wellington College and Wellington Academy. The academy has a boarding house, a Combined Cadet Force, an emphasis on service, academic excellence and holistic development, all traits of Wellington College.

Anthony told the story of how Wellington came to take on the academy project. Wellington College was founded in the 1850s as the memorial for the Duke of Wellington, to provide free education for military orphans in the wake of the Crimean War. The school is proud of its traditions and to this day offers fee support for children who have lost parents in the service of their country. But they are now only a small proportion of the intake.

The governors of the college decided to sponsor an academy to strengthen this original social mission. They deliberately took over a failing school in Tidworth, close to the Tidworth military garrison on Salisbury Plain, to reflect the college’s traditions and expertise. The academy takes up to half its pupils from military families. High levels of mobility are an obvious fact of life for children in military families, so the boarding option is particularly important.

With vision and leadership, there could be hundreds more academies sponsored by private school foundations, changing the face of education in this country for the better. Now is the time to act.

While I was helping to pioneer academies, two pieces of historic wisdom often came to mind. The first was Machiavelli. “It must be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new system,” he famously wrote. “For the initiator has the enmity of all who would profit by the preservation of the old institutions and merely lukewarm defenders in those who should gain by the new ones.”
He must have been writing about the reform of English education, I used to think. Fortunately, the success of academies is now pretty clear. The new system is there. It just needs to be scaled up.

However, equally compelling to me, as a reformer, are Churchill’s words on the opening of the new chamber of the House of Commons in 1950, replacing the one bombed by Hitler. “We mould our institutions and they mould us,” he said.

Institutions shape societies, and educational institutions do so perhaps more than any others outside the family.

Last Friday I visited the Petchey Academy, one of the five new academies in Hackney. Its sponsor, Jack Petchey, is one of the greatest East End businessmen and philanthropists of recent decades and his academy – hoping to get above the 80 per cent GCSE level in its first GCSE results this year – is inspirational is so many ways. The academy isn’t just about exam results, it is about education for character, for community and for citizenship. They do it brilliantly in one of the most deprived inner-city communities in the country. They were particularly keen I should see their debating teams from Years 10 and 11 debate before the whole of their two year groups. The debaters were articulate and well-prepared, just like in all those private school debating societies.

But the motion they were debating was as follows: “This House would abolish the private schools.” It was carried two to one. All the old arguments were there. Unfairness. Privilege. Elitism. Afterwards I asked the girl who had led the charge whether she had ever visited a private school. “Of course not,” she said. “Why would they want to have anything to do with anyone from around here?”

Why indeed. It is time to bury the past and build a better future. """,0,1359376634,null,0,false,0,c84yjch,t3_17fc2s,t1_c84yjch,t1_c84yjbi,null,1431106284,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Bild is definitely yellow press in Germany and most of their articles are shite and targeted for let's say a more blue collar audience. Having said that, they are always spot on when it comes to soccer news especially German soccer news.
They were the first to know that Magath was going to be sacked by Schalke
called the Martinez deal
same thing for Guardiola
this list can go on and on...
Their reporters have the best network and everybody is willing to talk to their editors and reporters. So if Bild says the deal is closed you can be certain that the deal is closed.

Sparrow Tattoo Meaning
Before we take a look at the different combinations and the sparrow tattoo meaning associated with each of them, let’s take a look at the simple sparrow tattoo meaning. Basically, a sparrow tattoo is associated with freedom, undying love and commitment to a single person. Loyalty, sacrifice and bonding are some other emotions that are associated with a sparrow tattoo. You would find that all these things are associated with most sparrow tattoos and you need to keep these in mind. Now, apart from these sparrow tattoo meanings, there are some other sparrow tattoo meanings that are associated with different tattoo designs. You would find that a sparrow tattoo that is made on the arm of a person signifies that the person values freedom over everything else. A person with a sparrow tattoo on his arm means that he is bound by no rules, and is the master of his own destiny. This sparrow tattoo meaning is particularly applicable to mafia bosses that have been known to endorse such sparrow tattoos.

My wife had to take this test as part of her visa application, and there were questions like:

* What is the average pocket money given to children in the UK?
* In what year were women given the right to vote?
* What percentage of children lives with both birth parents?
* A new born baby should be registered with The Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths within ______ weeks
* What percentage of the population live in Wales?
* After the Second World War where did British textile and engineering firms send agents to find workers?
* Which is the largest police force?
* When did the European Union originate?
* True/False? Civil servants can on occasion be pushed into open support for party policies they think to be either impractical or incompatible with other policies

Now imagine the current situation, where Gideon has ""got his fangs"" into the economy. Has his policies made the economy only shrink by say 0.5% each year? In which case they might be considered a success. Or have they caused the economy to shrink by 1.5% each year?

true,ChemicallyBlind,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"Personally season 6 was my favorite of all the new seasons. Season 5 had a few issues which i didnt like, Time of Angels and Flesh and Stone were easily the best episodes of the season. I didnt really like the finale, in fact the only finale i have liked so far is season 6s' but i digress. 

Victory of the daleks was disappointing and the whole 'we can stop you from self-destructing by getting you to remember all those memories planted in our head' really pissed me off, the fact that the daleks keep hesitating to exterminate the doctor when there is ample opportunity pissed me off too. 

The lodger was a a great episode and James Cordon does a fantastic job, Cold Blood annoyed me as i greatly dislike the new silurians design and its a plot that already been done before. 

Overall not really impressed by season 5, the whole 'love prevails over all' thing is getting tired. That being said the doctor who is redeemed in the season 6, i loved it. it has the best ending to date and i love the psychology involved in some of the episodes, i like the twists too and im really excited for season 7. 

In short, its entirely your own opinion but yes it does get better. 

Ill be honest im not surprised that your post was down voted, how dare you voice your own opinion (in a sickening sarcastic tone). I often find that many people on this thread are not true whovians because alot of them have not seen the original series and think that doctor who is a series that is immune to skepticism in a weird allegory for religion.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"I apologise if you got the impression that I was making a general negative statement about cyclists, but that wasn't my intention.  I was specifically addressing the question of where the hate comes from.

&gt; ""I'm a cyclist but..."" I always ask them to quantify that statement.

I ride a bicycle.  I don't claim to be a professional cyclist, cycling commuter or dedicated amateur.  I ""just"" ride a bike every now and then.  I believe that's sufficient to qualify me as a cyclist.

Similarly, I ""just"" drive a car.  I am not a professional driver or car enthusiast of any kind. I work from home and commute in my slippers.  I'd still call myself a motorist.

You are free to call me something else if my terminology bothers you.

&gt; The problem is ignorance, which you also are exhibiting.

No, you've completely missed the point.  I'm not saying that was typical behaviour of Critical Mass or any other cyclist.  I'm making the point that it's a few extremists, the hard-core anti-car mob that I happened to bump into on one side, and the equally loud-mouthed petrol-heads like Clarkson on the other, that are the source of the ""thinking behind hating cyclists"" (and vice versa) that mountainfall was wondering about.

&gt; They did not take your ""rights"" away.

With respect, you weren't there so you have no idea what unpleasantness transpired from both cyclists and motorist (by definition, people on bicycles and people in cars, respectively).  This wasn't a peaceful CM protest, it was more like a roque anti-car flying squad trying to cause as much disruption as possible. I had a man on a bike leaning through my open car window, practically spitting with rage and shouting obscenities for no other reason than the fact that I was driving a car.  But I'm well aware of the fact that he and his crowd weren't representative of pro-cycling groups or cyclists in general.  Nor do I think that motorists are represented by the tiny minority of drivers who target innocent cyclists simply because of *their* chosen mode of transport in that particular day.

No, but that will end up being a benefit for London.  When the difference in time between a commute to Manchester and London is only a few minutes, but the difference in pay is significant, it starts making a lot of sense.

As to that venture capital firm, I would assume that all the benefits of London are going to remain constant (recognition, heart of government, other corporate HQ's and so on) and at that point you no-longer need a branch office somewhere outside of London.. Sure cheaper office space will help for some but.. meh.

The example given this morning was Italy, where the same cases were presented (for Seville and Milan?), but the benefit ended up being largely in Milans favour..

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; As I thought, I would call you a rare recreational cyclist with very little empathy with someone who is forced to interact with motor vehicles on a regular basis.

Very little direct experience, yes, but that's not to say that I don't empathise with your predicament.

&gt; If you were a regular commuter cyclist you would know this to be false. Hate and dangerous driving comes at me everyday I cycle, unless that happens to be 4am when there are no cars about.

I stand corrected.

&gt; I have to ask the question what did you do?

If you mean what I had done to provoke him, nothing.  I spent half an hour sitting in a traffic jam before I creeped into the fray.  I don't know how it had escalated, but there was a lot of shouting and taunting going on by both cyclists and motorists.  The police were there trying to break it all up and get everything moving again.  I had my young kids in the car so I had no intention of getting involved in any kind of altercation but had it thrust upon me. 

As I said previously, I don't think this was Critical Mass, but more a rogue bunch of anti-car militant greenies who were just looking to stir up some trouble.  Although, to be honest, I didn't see any banners, T-shirts, or whatever saying what group they were supposedly representing so I have no idea.  It was about 10 years ago in Richmond Park, for what it's worth.  

I have no explanation for the idiots in cars who deliberately target cyclists and I'm surprised to hear that it's as common as you say it is.  Ignorance and stupidity I can understand but deliberately endangering people's lives is another thing altogether.  I despair of the human race some times.

Hopefully we get the Coutinho deal done pretty quickly, appart from Suarez we lack creativity and he really looks like he could add to the team. I mean he's got 92 dribbling on FIFA, same dribbling stat as Ronaldo. 

As for Ince I don't know what to think of it. 8 million seams like a lot of money, and we already have a lot of wingers/attackers anyway. Personally I'd like it if BR looked into non English wingers a I mean there's a lot of cheap talent out there. Any thoughts on this?

Unfortunately, the UK has not been influential enough to plunge the world into a recession since before WW2; so I must say pinning the blame on the Labour party is an exaggeration on your behalf.

Furthermore, claiming any particular politician is full of shit is an exercise in futility. We already know they're full of shit, and most of us realise that the opposition usually attacks the policies of the ruling party without offering solutions.

Labour promises to increase spending on the poor, to stop dismantling the Welfare state and to end privatisation of the NHS. Whether they will actually do it remains to be seen, but this naturally appeals to the working classes; as to many people the fate of the economy is irrelevant as long as they can survive the recession without going hungry.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; No, but that will end up being a benefit for London. When the difference in time between a commute to Manchester and London is only a few minutes, but the difference in pay is significant, it starts making a lot of sense.

I don't get that. There are hardly any intermediate stations, in general to commute to London using this route you have to go through Manchester, Birmingham, or wherever. Clearly commuting times won't be made equal.

&gt; As to that venture capital firm, I would assume that all the benefits of London are going to remain constant (recognition, heart of government, other corporate HQ's and so on) and at that point you no-longer need a branch office somewhere outside of London.. Sure cheaper office space will help for some but.. meh.

I was talking about two different cases there. The first case is a venture capital firm, which by definition is trying to invest in outside businesses, so their primary desire is to have quick transport links to potential investment opportunities. These opportunities will often be locked to a particular area, by a cluster of expertise, or by pre-existing facilities and equipment. For instance, a venture capital firm which specializes in medical devices might want to invest in a company like RSLSteeper (http://bebionic.com/about_us). If you assume ten minutes at each end, to get to that business, in an industrial estate on the outskirts of Leeds, this reduces door to door central London travel time from 2h 40m to 1h 50m, and central Birmingham travel time from 2h 20m to 1h 20m.

The second case is a business which wishes to set up some a semi-independent subsidiary section of the company. [This is the sort of travel time in central London](http://www.mysociety.org/2007/more-travel-maps/SW1P4DR_20km_contours_800.png), you can see that if your office is near Euston, a subsidiary business in Birmingham will take as long to get to as one in West Kensington.",0,1359393985,null,0,false,0,c852dr9,t3_17f2si,t1_c852dr9,t1_c851oid,null,1431108187,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

It is interesting to see that these have not yet taken any effect, and to my mind that demonstrates the inertia in public spending particularly on big projects.

So yes, the figures bear out the falling capital expenditure, but that could still represent the misguided changes made in 2010 with a lag from the further announced changes.

As a serving soldier and officer deploying back to Helmand in less than a week, on the whole I am pleased that this change is may well be coming about. The biggest concern I have is about standards. Currently within in the British Armed Forces there are two separate physical standards, one for each gender. They are also scaled relating to age. For example, the basic physical fitness test more challenging if you are a man, than if you are a woman, but the standards are lower for a 30 year old than for a 20 year old.
It is this difference in standards that, as a commander on the ground, I am most concerned about. As an infantry platoon commander on the ground in Afghanistan, I had no problems with females in my platoon (such as medics) provided that they were as physically fit as the remainder of the platoon. Similarly I had no problems with males in the platoon, provided they were as physically fit as the remainder of the platoon. Unfortunately, this wasn't always the case, and I can think of one example where the quick reaction force didn't get to a casualty as quickly as they could have done because the medic in the platoon physically wasn't able to cover the ground as fast as the rest of the platoon, and was in rag order when they did finally get there. It doesn't make a difference if the medic was female or male, it was the objective physical ability that made the difference.
At RMAS (Royal Military Academy Sandhurst) I was in the same company as the girls' platoon. Some of the girls would have made excellent infantry platoon commanders. Most of the blokes wouldn't have, but the girls didn't get the opportunity. The less capable men were weeded out and rightly so. It should have been the less capable officers were weeded out. But the girls had lower physical standards than the men, and this is not right.
My feelings can be summed up as follows: when the brown stuff hits the whirly thing, I couldn't give a rat's arse if the person treating and evacuating a casualty to the HLS has got tits or not. I care about whether they can do their job. If a soldier is going to struggle conducting some of the rigorous physical effort that being a combat infanteer involves, such as carrying a stretcher through irrigation ditches and up hills, then I do not want them as a combat infanteer. I do not care if they are a man or a woman.
If I'm honest, I don't think that age should alter the physical standards either; any variation in standard (if indeed any is required) should relate purely to the role you carry out not what size or shape you are. It is also worth noting that standards are also scaled according to role, for example the basic standard shooting tests are harder if you are in the infantry than if you are in a supporting corps. I firmly believe in the Armed Forces being selective, elitist and based on merit. Doing the job that we do, we should only accept the best people for a given role, regardless of whether they are male or female.
TL;DR: women in the armed forces (regardless of role) should meet the same standards as men.",0,1359394537,null,0,false,0,c852k56,t3_17b9ri,t1_c852k56,t3_17b9ri,null,1431108277,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,darkotter,null,null,"(Emma student here) The accomodation in Emma is (apart from Old Court, which is a special case) split between shared and not shared - you will always have a bedroom to yourself, but you will share bathroom and (very basic) kitchen facilities. There are a few exceptions to this, some (more expensive) rooms have their own bathrooms (although you will not have one of these in first year). Old Court is much more shared than other parts of the accomodation (although people in Old Court still have separate bedrooms), but no-one has to stay in Old Court, it is only by choice (and actually very popular).

As for choosing who to share with, you will be able to do this through the balloting system in later years, but for first year it is pot luck. My advice would be to not worry about this - wherever your friend is in college they will not be too far to visit, and you will meet lots of nice people wherever you are living. It's also good practice for making friends with the people in your department I guess, which I thoroughly recommend as it will make things easier. All first year accomodation is in the main part of college itself (some people stay in outside properties later, particularly in second year), so everyone will be quite close by.

If you're wondering what to expect of your room itself, it will have a bed, a desk, and a small fridge. Other than that, they are quite variable, some of the first year rooms are fairly large and even have separate sleeping and lounge-like areas, replete with a sofa, but don't expect this. I am told however, by friends who have visitied from other universities, that all of the 6 rooms I have stayed in so far have been huge compared to accomodation at other universities, so I think it's safe to say they are all reasonably sized.

I guess you can't use ""what ifs"" to say we're better than we are, but we were the best team in those game. Everton especially stung since it was a clear goal disallowed at the death. 

Overall, I'm happier in our place here now than last season. I'd rather beat the teams we're 'supposed to beat' and at least be equal to the teams above us (ie draws) or put up a good show. The constant inconsistencies are what drives me nuts. I never know where to put my expectations. We'll beat Chelsea and lose at home to a bottom ten team the next week. Putting up a good show against the best is great, but if we can't take care of business on the other ends it doesn't do much for us.

With inprovement in players and system the losses (City, Everton) can turn into wins and losses like Arsenal and United can hopefully turn into at least draws. As long as our current form against bottom ten teams can stabilize as it is now, we can focus on getting business done on the top half. Keep in mind that early on this season we had a ton of kinks to work out at the same time we played a lot of the top teams.

Thankfully my school got a slice of Gordon Browns school rebuilding funds. The Huts were demolished and they built a brand new building. Also since the school is near Heathrow Airport they made it airplane noise proof so none of the kids today have to go through that miserable experience.

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;Why is it that I always hear non-Londoners complain about the amount of spending London gets?

I'm not complaining about the spending London gets, it's about how we prioritise spending and about the fact that there are huge issues in other areas, that, if they were dealt with would reduce the amount of subsidy needed.

We are in a position where it is cheaper to travel around London than it is to do the same in many other areas, that depresses local economies.  We focus government in London and the city is in London, which means that for many companies and organisations, there is little point in moving outside of London.  And of course that huge concentration of people requires services and goods and so on.

If we can replicate that to some degree outside of London, or at least see investment to make it easier to do so,  it will mean that the UK as a whole does better. At the moment we see the reverse (or rather a disjointed approach), investment and regeneration, followed by a withdrawal of it, that causes huge problems. 

&gt;We get shafted to much and all everyone does is complain about how much we get.

I'm not sure London gets shafted as such, or at least comparably. But there are issues with the housing that should be addressable (and indeed would be if places like Birmingham and Manchester lived up to their full potential).  I'd also add that some movement (like the attempts to regionalise the civil service and move bits of the BBC to salford) are steps in the right direction, but you still have huge problems, it costs a fortune to travel by bus in Manchester, transport isn't well integrated, the same goes for Sheffield, services outside of the absolute centre aren't as regular as they should be and there is little investment (Oh and of course the whole structure of Tfl is massively better, but denied to the regions post privatisation...) 

Anyway, it shouldn't be about 'punishing' London, but we do need to take into account the differences in the various economies and try to mitigate the impact as best as possible.  ",0,1359396873,null,0,false,0,c853ahd,t3_17f2si,t1_c853ahd,t1_c8531yp,null,1431108616,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There were a few shots that I wasn't too impressed with... like the blurring of everything just for the title card, which I thought was unnecessary... And there was a part where the focus was on the tea cup yet you're pulling the tea jar -where the action is, and that was still out of the range of the depth of field. I felt like that should be well within it.

There's also something about the sound that didn't really sit right with me, the only one that I didn't exactly like was just the humming of the boiling kettle. Because you used different shots with their original sound, it changes frequencies (loudness? volume? you get my drift). I think this is where some folley work could be good where the kettle boiling sound would be uniformed throughout because you add it on after. Also I thought the snap of the kettle switch when it finished boiling could've been a bit louder or something to give more umph.

I like how everything is colour coordinated though - the pink jars and kettle, white polkadotted mug and cupcake themed mat/tin. Nice attention to detail with these. I would suggest doing some colour balancing and bumping up the saturation and contrast just to make it look more pristine, as I'd imagine your kitchen doesnt have amazing studio quality lighting.

All in all, its a nice idea, but was too long to wait for a punch line. the music was a nice choice -very 'british'.

You got the feeling that nobody really knew what they were doing.

I'm sure some people will say that I don't like those episodes because I was grieving the loss of Ten but I disagree. I just think that most of the early episodes of Season 5 are stupid.

true,abw,guildford,Guildford,"Write to Anne Milton?  What a good idea!  Thanks to http://www.writetothem.com/, I can do that right now.  

Here's the letter I sent.

**Dear Anne Milton,**

I recently came across a rather lurid flier from the ""Campaign For Marriage"" urging me to write to you. A copy of it can be seen here:

http://i.imgur.com/PnyBPkD.jpg

I did feel compelled to write, but to tell you that I fully support reforms to marriage and believe in equality for all people regardless of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, the football team they support, the music they listen to, or their preferred biscuit for dunking in a cup of tea. 

I have the greatest of respect for people wishing to live by their their own beliefs and those that don't agree with same-sex marriage will of course be free to abstain from it - after all, no-one has the right to force them to marry someone of a gender that they are fundamentally incompatible with. So let's extend the same right to all. Those that do wish to marry their loved ones should be able to do so, regardless of gender, without interference from a bigoted and intolerant minority who mistakenly believe that they have the right to act as moral guardians for us all. 

Yours sincerely,

[abw]

2. I'll give you that and fair play to the trade union concerned. However, a [quick search](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=psni+bomb&amp;src=typd) on Twitter reveals none of the withering condemnation and ridicule of IRA attempts on the lives of police officers from amongst the public at large relative to the mania surrounding 'oplockdown' or whatever other nonsense is being spread about flags this week. Similarly so with the members of this subreddit.

&gt;You have a short/ selective memory and are looking for a double standard that's not actually there.

I've just backed up my opinion with the relevant links showing a very clear inbalance of reporting. If the organisers were attempting to put *any* public pressure on militant republicans then as evidenced above they failed to do so. Are they happy with the way their message became a flag of convenience for the media's thirst for wall-to-wall riot coverage? Certainly too, the twitter echo chamber surrounding said rally didn't appear to give any backing to the belief that this was about anything other than reclaiming the city from flag protestors.

The outward displays of public determination to end serious and targeted terrorism, based on the anecdotal but quite substantial evidence above is token at best compared with relative OCD levels over road diversions or the riots.

true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"Bicycles have things called gears and many people, even now, commute a good 20 miles each way.  Keeping a bicycle in a small house is quite easy, there are plenty of wall/ceiling storage solutions available.  Easier, in fact, than finding somewhere to park a car.  Cheaper too, even folding bikes - massively cheaper than owning a car.

I get the feeling you're just repeating the same excuses used on the continent before cycling became popular there.  Half the population of England and Wales commute less than 5km to work.  68% less than 10km.  83% less than 20km.  All perfectly reasonable distances to cycle; in fact, to anyone who's cycled for a few months, all piss easy distances.

What's their excuse for clogging up the roads with their vehicles?  Sure, a minority will need their car to carry heavy equipment, but only a minority.  The answer is that a good percentage of them are put off cycling by stories of it being ""unsafe"".  Build facilities they feel safe using, and they'll use them.

It's no different to the ""build more roads and more cars will come"" line.  Build proper, continental-style cycling facilities and you'll soon see them chock-full of cyclists.

It was brilliant - they had a mandate (record turnouts in elections), and the university listened, and it was overall very impressive. This trend seems to be continuing and was recognised last year when they won student union of the year.

If only all student unions could be like that - it is actually quite astounding what they can achieve, on a local level at least, when they put their minds to it.

true,yeebles,uk,Hertfordshire,"Well, I feel the infrastructure, although costly at the time, should lead to improved economic growth. Also the fact that it links areas which have have higher levels of poverty than the South East it should also aid in a better income distribution.

So assuming that the new infrastructure should benefit economic growth and distribution I believe that through various processes such as the Economic Multiplier that overall the UK should be better off.

Also rail has less negative externalities such as pollution compared to road and air maybe even improving the nation in that sense.

I think the trouble is that we often use the mentality if it doesn't benefit me directly then it has no benefits.

Plus, I imagine HS2 will ease the load of existing lines leading to possibly better service on the trains of the older network (London Midland trains at peak times are the worst!). Maybe the competition will even stop the never ending many price increases?

Plus I imagine it may improve some journeys for yourself. If going from a between London and Birmingham place you could get a train to Birmingham then navigate the many platforms of Birmingham New Street and hop all aboard the HS2 to Manchester/Leeds/Sheffield/wherever else they extend it to. 

It's not a perfect project but I feel it will improve the country. I feel people in my area fail to see the bigger picture, but that is what it is like over in rural areas. Plus spending on infrastructure according to some schools of thought are perfect to get out of economic recession to growth.

1b) The Doctor claimed it was his...  but as we all know... Rule #1 could apply!

2b) I don't think there would be...  mainly because David and Billie are both happy to have moved on to other things...

2c) Mainly because she had made a life for herself on that parallel universe, and no longer belonged in ours.

I suppose they're young, but given the squad depth we already had it would have been far better to put the fees/wages of Garcia, Sinclair and Rodwell toward someone who can really make a difference. 

Another striker would only hurt FFP when fans and players alike are already upset at Dzeko's lack of playing time given his form.

It would be better to wait until the summer for three reasons: 1) if we get a new manager, they will necessarily shake up the squad and won't have more new signings to deal with 2) we won't pay over the odds 3) if we do sell, we can get a better price for Dzeko and put that toward Cavani or Falcao.

The only exception would be if we could get Modric for a rock bottom price. Beyond that, we should wait for the summer to gauge possible striking options, and bring in another creative MF (Isco) while giving him time to adapt to the new team.

Finally, I hope we aren't given Prince-Boateng - especially as it would cut into Milner's playing time and he's been finally getting the games he deserves. ",0,1359413056,null,0,false,0,c858xle,t3_17fied,t1_c858xle,t3_17fied,null,1431111277,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

From what I've seen, and this could just be my bias, I really really think Mata will play his best years at the Bridge.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I applaud scientists moving into public debate in this, but his opinion is something which frustrates me, and something I've discussed a couple of times with fellow students. There are two issues here. First, the actual competence of the research council to do this job, and the effectiveness of the systems which they've set up to do it. I can't comment on that, and the video doesn't talk much about it. Second, as the video talks about at length, the degree to which we should be spending money on pure research or applied research. 

Pure research is absolutely vital, as he says it expands the domain of human knowledge, and lays the foundations for long-term applications which can revolutionarize society and hugely improve living standards. But his entire thesis is based on the idea that there's nothing else, that you do early stage research, and then leave it to industry. He is essentially dismissing the idea of all publicly funded applied research, which is the idea that you concentrate on areas of study which are close to application in the real world, and commercialization. The truth is, you have research which is very long term, and very uncertain, and you have industrial research which is close to market, and you have all levels in between. It's nonsense to say that the government should only fund the very earliest stages, and that anything further is a subsidy to industry. 

This attitude has a long and storied tradition. The first synthetic dye was invented in Britain, by William Perkins, and he commercialized it. The British had a 'gentleman amateur' attitude towards science, and no public money went into further research. In contrast, the German state poured money into the area, developed superior dyes which put Perkins out of business, and laid the foundation for their extraordinary dominance in industrial chemistry which continues to this day. Likewise, the Lithium Ion battery was also invented in Britain, but we had no industrial expertise in the area, and invested no money, and Japan now dominates the market. Similarly, MRI scanners. Pure research is like planting the seeds in an orchard, they will bear fruit, but we do not live in a closed domain, but rather in a global commons of ideas, and any government and/or company can take that idea and profit from it; if you wish to avoid starving, you can't solely plant trees for other people, you must also sometimes pick the fruit.

true,harryyeah,null,null,"If the other creditors are serious about getting their money back they can go to court and obtain an order placing the company into either liquidation or administration. I would say that a liquidation appears more likely based on your comments, unless the company has some assets/business that would it (now run by the insolvency practitioner rather than the directors) be able to sell for more if they're still trading. A liquidation normally realises assets on a piecemeal basis, if there are any.

If the assets are realised for an amount roughly equal to the cost of selling them plus the cost of putting a cheque for £1 in the post to each creditor then you might get something.  The cost of selling assets includes the insolvency practitioner's fees. After that there are a few classes of creditors you need to worry about. Amount owed and time the debt was incurred is not important in a formal insolvency. For debts that can be sufficiently proved (invoices, emails, bank statements etc.), they will be part of the unsecured creditor class. This class receives the pool of cash left over after paying the creditors with charges (either mortgages over property or general charges over total or subset of assets). Banks will almost always have a charge but if the other creditors are traders then it is unlikely they'll outrank you. Unpaid employee wages outrank unsecured creditors too. Each unsecured creditor is treated equally, receiving the same fixed percentage of their proved debt. 

In respect of the directors, the insolvency practitioner must submit a report to the department of business, innovation and skills on the conduct of directors. This covers wrongful trading (eg. Trading while insolvent) and preference payments (eg. Paying off their friend who lent them money before going bust), but the practitioner lacks a serious incentive to do this properly when dealing with very small companies.

Keep your eyes peeled for companies house notices that an insolvency practitioner has been appointed, then submit your claim. They send out updates to creditors and then cheques once the job is done.

true,Unicross,null,null,"For once my area of speciality! I work in insurance. A few tips:

1. The cheapest is not always the best, be sure to read through the small print to make sure you're getting the right cover you need, if its not right for you, you're paying for some pointless paper.

2. Don't ever under insure yourself. Your contents cover is there for anything that isn't nailed down. If you turn your home upside down, everything that falls out needs covering. Insurers use what's known as an average clause. Say the value of your contents overall was £50,000. You insure for £20,000 (40% of the real value), your washing machine breaks and causes £10,000 of damage, the insurer is allowed to pay out £4,000 (40% of the claim) as you were shown to be under insurers at the time you took the policy out. In some cases the insurer won't have to pay out a penny.

3. Double and triple check your excesses. Most insurers will have a minimum compulsory excess of £100. Adding a voluntary excess of £150 on top of that to save £20 over the 12 months the policy runs is not worth it, as in the event of any claim you have to find the first £250! Also you will usually have higher excesses for escape of water (burst pipe / broken dishwasher, usually minimum £250) and subsidence (minimum £1000). 

4. Double and triple check your charges. This is where most companies will sting you. You legally have 14 days to cancel, but they can still charge an administration fee and any additional products may be charged at full price (not governed the same) after 14 days I've known some unscrupulous companies not refund a penny. Companies can and will charge for any amendments, reprints, etc.

5. If you can afford it, don't go on installments. Again some companies will charge ridiculous amounts (I've seen up to 40% APR with a £20 initial fer) for the pleasure of you paying by direct debit. You will also be charged for ant returned payments (standard is £20, I've seen £50!). Also, being on installments gives the company the right to auto renew your policy, paying in full will force you to shop around each year.

6. Blanket policies (Buildings UP TO £1million, contents UP TO £250,000) will usually have very restrictive terms on what is covered (i.e. cash in home up to £150 max, etc) see point 1, be very careful before buying one of these.

7. Banks are usually the worst for insurers, they usually tie people in with the mortgage for the first year and give the impression you need to stay with them. You do NOT have to insure with your bank if your mortgage is with them, they just need to know you have buildings cover in place for the correct amount, if they tell you anything else its bullshit.

8. Insurance is pretty much just betting, the only thing is the risk is all your belongings and them a microscopic bit if their bottom line, which they will fight tooth and nail over. Catalogue any items over the value of £1000, photograph them and receipts and keep them in a fireproof / waterproof box or at another location (relative's home or safety deposit box), this will make any claim you make go through much quicker.

9. If you have accidental damage cover or additional products make sure they're right for you and you can't buy them cheaper elsewhere. You will usually get a basic level of accidental damage cover (high value electrical items, read tv, and your porcelains, read toilet and sink). You don't usually need enhanced unless you'll be pouring paint on a carpet or putting a hammer through a wall any time soon. Additional products like Home Emergency cover should not cost you over £25, insurers will mark these up as they get a bigger cut if sold with home insurance. 

10. Comparison sites are good for checking ball park figures but you'll rarely get the best deal as the cover will usually lack in a some area or the ancillary products / installment costs will be humongous. They will also have to do a credit check each time you put your details in (the more comparison sites you use, the more checks get made which can have an adverse affect on your score in some situations). 

I would recommend calling a broking agency, even if you just get a quote, they will take you through a range of questions which will force you to think about what you need to cover. My rule of thumb is think about your contents (even your clothes count) and multiply by 1.25 so you don't underinsure (see point 2).

The above poster was correct about the Angel Hotel, we had our department ball there and it was awesome. It might be a bit expensive though, so you might be better off staying at the Etap or something cheaper around town. The cheapest alternative is to live in Cardiff University student housing at a discounted rate since it'll be empty; that will help you gain a greater understanding of what residential neighbourhoods are like (they advertise this EVERY SUMMER, so if you want to know more PM me and I'll send you a link!) 

My advice is to walk around and sample things, but understand that you won't really know shit till you are living here for a longer term. You won't learn a lot about the history of Wales by walking around in Cardiff on most nights; use your time here to take train journeys to various towns and see the historical sights there in addition to exploring Cardiff. You'll also meet more ""Welsh people"" (speakers and natives) this way.

Whether or not Israel or Jews anywhere in the world are victims of antisemitism is entirely irrelevant to the fact that Israel is behaving unconscionably and must be held to account.

Let's be very careful that we do not play into the hands of those who would benefit from such diversions and shout so loudly that no other things are heard.

true,erythro,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;I absolutely made no such argument.

Any implications that you have made such an argument were accidental, I can assure you.  This whole piece and comment thread have been about that argument and how it is anti-semitic.  When you are saying their behaviour is indefensible whether Israel meets the raised standard or not, you are moving on to change the subject to whether Israel's behaviour is bad or not.  I am happy for that discussion to continue, but just to keep the tendril of the conversation attached to what the subject previously was, I repeated a plea not to use the anti-semitic argument whilst discussion the subject you changed the conversation to.

So I didn't mean to imply you actually used the argument, and I only mentioned it so that you did not completely change the subject.

&gt;Whether or not Israel or Jews anywhere in the world are victims of antisemitism is entirely irrelevant to the fact that Israel is behaving unconscionably and must be held to account.

Agreed, those statements are not connected, as I was saying above.

&gt;Antisemitism is a very powerful word and it would be very easy to use it to obfuscate other issues.

Agreed again - however the fact you are mentioning that at all does contain the implication that you may have felt I was doing that.  Is that the case?  I felt I stated pretty clearly why I felt that argument was anti-semitic.  If Israel's behaviour is truly as terrible as you say, then my objection to genuinely anti-semitic arguments should not impede or obfuscate the discussion, should it?

&gt;Let's be very careful that we do not play into the hands of those who would benefit from such diversions and shout so loudly that no other things are heard.

Very well.  But of course we can do that without tolerating anti-semitism, can't we?

&gt;While we try to stop a few people being antisemitic, must we ignore all other criticisms of Israel?

Of course not!  I hope I never implied that.

&gt;Finally, ""putting my words in scare quotes"" repeatedly is a rather unpleasant technique.

Maybe you can help me here.  I find myself using quotation marks where I am not quoting anyone, simply to refer to a set phrase without confusion.  What I find myself using the quotation marks is to corner off a phrase so that people know it is the subject of what I am saying.

For example:

&gt;&gt;Fine - then drop the ""they of all should know after the holocaust"" argument

No one actually said that in any discussion, but it's a phrase that refers to and identifies the argument.  Without quotation marks it reads

&gt;&gt;Fine - then drop the they of all should know after the holocaust argument

Where does the phrase begin and end?  What exactly would I be referring to here?  Personally, I'd find myself using the same vocal tones I'd use for quoting here, which is perhaps why I find myself using that punctuation.  I think I am trying to collapse all those words into a single adjective, where none exists, so am using quotation marks to signal that.

Anyway, if there is some official way of doing this, that you know of and can let me know, that would be much appreciated.  I don't want to mislead people.",0,1359419354,null,0,false,0,c85b1xf,t3_17cfq6,t1_c85b1xf,t1_c85aij1,null,1431112474,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If you're struggling with Hartnell, skip ahead to something else. I would suggest something from Tom Baker. 
You can always come back to the Hartnell stories another time. The next story after The Edge of Destruction is Marco Polo, a seven episode story which doesn't exist anymore, so if you're finding Hartnell a struggle now, Soundtracks or reconstructions will defiantly be a struggle, so you'll probably skip anyway (although an easier 30min cut down version is available on the Edge of Destruction disc)

I don't know that I would suggest jumping to Troughton straight away though, the pacing is not that different from Hartnells episodes and not a lot of it survives.

But it's plain for everyone to see that an accusation of antisemitism is an extremely effective tool for removing an opponent's credibility and shutting down the argument.

Which is of course not to say that you are doing this at all, but it has happened so often in the past that everyone is extremely defensive any time antisemitism is brought up.

Scare quotes are a common technique where one will put quotation marks around part of someone's quotation, often unnecessary or redundant because of the context, to imply that there is some subtext or hidden meaning in the words. Compare:

&gt;The vicar was heard to remark that the boys were only helping him clean out the storage room

vs
&gt;The vicar was heard to remark that the boys were ""only"" helping him clean out the storage room

You can see that by drawing attention to the word 'only' I imply that the vicar is being untruthful.

It sounds like it wasn't your intention after all, but quoting my words twice in such a fashion effectively implied that I was suggesting more than the face-value of the sentence.

It can be quite difficult to selectively quote someone like that *without* implying anything. But perhaps instead you might like to try italics instead of quotation marks:

true,packersfan65,null,null,"Science is a shit job and nobody should do it.

The career structure is terrible. In the english speaking world it is now just about impossible to find any kind of salaried job till your mid to late thirties. Good luck getting a mortgage or supporting a family on that. Postdocs force you to move location (sometimes country) every few years if you have any kind of ambition. And after that, permanent jobs are just about impossible to get.

Writing research grants essentially consists of lying and hoping you can publish something afterwards. 

The publication system fucking sucks. Greedy publishers gleefully rip the taxpayer off by making them pay for research twice - once when they pay for the research, and again for their own universities to read their own research. And the public can't read about it anyway. For taxpayer research to be stuck behind paywalls in the 21st century is obscene. Scientists go along with this because they're too cowardly to challenge this obviously shit system. 

Scientific peer review is a joke. I have yet to hear how 3 randomly chosen people deciding to give the thumbs-up to a paper because it cites them or they had a good breakfast that day, magically makes that paper worth sharing with the public. Look, sharing research with the rest of the world should be the easiest fucking thing on earth. Put it online. Allow links and comments from named people. That's it. Even fucking Reddit is better than what passes for exchange of information among scientists.

The career incentives for fraud in science are enormous. The cases of known falsification of research are, I'm convinced, just the tip of the iceberg. Talk to any research group and they'll tell you, those *other* groups X, Y and Z, their papers just can't be trusted... the problem is that *nobody publishes replication studies*. Because everyone's too busy worrying about their own career ladders in order to worry about what's actually true.

Worst of all, science fucks over smart people who should be contributing usefully to humanity. PhD's are basically McDonald's jobs that amount to paying bright young people far less than they're worth in order for them to get a piece of paper.  PhD's now amount to a pyramid scheme. As for the argument that PhD's train people for other jobs, the opportunity cost is appalling. You do not need to spend 3 to 4 years of your life (in the USA, a horrifying 7 years) studying why mice have curly pubes in order to be a competent researcher. 

I went to university with many people who were dazzlingly smart, idealistic, bold, keen, tenacious. They're all out of science now, mostly trying to make it in the business world with no helpful experience from their PhD's or research jobs, having, honestly, wasted about five years of their lives.

Tell everyone you're Canadian? I kid, I kid. 

The usual touristy places in Cardiff are great, the view from the castle (weather permitting) is glorious. There are smaller less touristy places too, like [Clwb Ifor Bach](http://www.clwb.net/eng/) (which is a small multistory music venue and club). Whatever music you're into, you should be able to find something to rock/chill out to. Cardiff's a lovely city for the most part, and while there are a few rough areas (as with any city), you'll almost certainly be fine. The night life in Cardiff (and in Newport) is a lot of fun. 

Relatively near to Cardiff is [Castell Coch](http://www.wales360.co.uk/castell_coch/), which I'm told I should go see. 

If you're a Doctor Who/Torchwood fan, the Doctor Who museum is supposed to be a must.

More random advice would be ""bring american candy"", because while I personally think most of it is inedible rubbish, some (lunatics) consider it a delicacy and it's damned expensive over here.

But if they're genuinely doing a hide-down / phoenix company - so if they've stripped the assets of a dying company to pump into a new one so the old one has no assets to claim against, Companies House et al will be interested as they're cracking down on that (I think it's already illegal, especially if you can prove it's being done with malice). If the old company actually fully went bust I'm surprised they haven't had some judgement that stops them trading under a similar (enough) name to use the old website/branding, too. Breaking that might put them on dodgy ground but you'd have to take advice there.

If the old company's still up somehow, not officially declared insolvent that's a bit... odd. And probably wrong, and something again you can get advice on.

If they're not a limited company, you can probably pursue action against the directors personally, depending on the circumstance, as they don't have the limited liability protection of a LTD.

true,The-Darkest-Knight,num19,,"So today Lewis Holtby's deal has been done and dusted and he'll be with us end of January. Splendid. But after reading through all the comments on here, I'm a little shocked about how some people are setting up the team and how they think it's going to happen. Sure, we'll all entitled to our opinion, and this is mine, and you might not agree with it but I've got decent logic behind all of this.

First of all, we have Lloris in goal. No one disagrees. Secondly, Spurs need a back four. We absolutely cannot function with three center backs in the form of Vertonghen+Dawson+Walker/Caulker at the moment, primary reason being that Dawson and Caulker aren't nippy center backs and neither is Vertonghen and Walker is really not dependable as a defender no matter how much pace he has. We simply can't lug all of that responsibility onto him. If we play with 3 CB's, we are going to leak goals. Even if we do get Kaboul, it might be worth a thought to have Dawson+Vertonghen+Kaboul playing as 3 CB's, but I don't think AvB is going to leave out Benny and Walker from regular starting spots. Spurs need four at the back for defensive solidity.

Secondly, going up, you have to remember two things.

1. Please forget about this Sigurdsson craze. There's another thread on here that we had after the FA Cup and pretty much everyone agreed that Siggy is not working out. He has been giving ample chances to shine, but he hasn't. He's been given enough starts in the FA Cup and the Europa League, but he has not taken them. The season is 60-65% done and he's failed each time. So please, FORGET ABOUT SIGGY. I'm fairly certain that he's going to be either sold in the summer, or he's going to go for a season long loan to another club next season.

2. The second point is about Dempsey. I know that the American population of /r/coys loves him, but he was on the bench when Ade+Defoe were starting (which was disastrous) but that tells us about AvB's rating of Dempsey. Sure, he's got important goals for us and he's got great positioning, but he's not in the form he was in with Fulham last season even though he's playing the same position and getting enough chances. I like Dempsey, but I think when the whole squad is fit, he won't be in the first eleven.

3. Holtby. Levy would not have bought Holtby in January simply to have him on the bench (as someone suggested). If AvB had told him hey, I need another player on the bench for some quality, let's spend money on Holtby now, Levy would have said fuck no and make do with the squad you have now, develop someone for a position. 100% certain that AvB said that we need Holtby in the first eleven to glue things together, which is why Levy agreed. That's the only way Levy (LEVY!) is going to spend money even though he's getting something for free later.

4. That brings me to my formation. The back four and GK are obvious, given what I said about the defence. Sandro is out, Parker is trying to find his form and he's three times the player Huddlestone and Livermore are combined, so Parker is a definite in that middle of the park for cutting out counter attacks and for throwing in a tackle.

5. Dembele is our most important player. If you don't agree with that, you haven't been watching Spurs games. Lennon and Bale are magnificent on the wings, but for the ball to get to them and for them to create a chance, it's been up to Dembele+Parker or Dembele+Sandro earlier to win balls, keep possession, keep circulation and get things moving. We've been pathetic without Dembele, and he's just so important.

6. There's no way Lennon or Bale are going to be on the bench, I'm not even going to throw in an argument for them.

7. Now. Up top. No matter how much I curse Defoe for being a selfish twat who shoots on sight, that's exactly what we needed against Leeds in the FA Cup. I'm positive that if Defoe had started he would have got at least one goal and had taken 20 shots, 10 to test the keeper. Defoe is the choice right now since Ade is at the ACN, when he gets back, there might be circulation. But for now, it's Defoe.

8. Finally, I know a lot of you said Sigurdsson/Dempsey/Holtby behind Defoe, but I've made a choice. The wisest one to make given the logic in the preceding points. Holtby is the key to our season ending well. He's great at short passes, long passes, shots, runs into the box and AvB is going to develop him over 2-3 games as THE man for us. Remember how I said February is the most important month for Spurs? Well, Holtby coming in just to ensure that the important month goes well. I can see him playing 1-2's with Defoe to get him a shot on goal, taking a shot from outside the box himself, opening up the defence and sliding the ball to Lennon and Bale through on the wings or at goal. He's going to be the pivot around who the attack is going to be built. And who will support him? Dembele. I see both of them coming up, keeping Parker at the back, playing passes to one another and getting that final ball into the box for someone to lash out at.

Why can't Siggy or Dempsey do this? Because they've tried, and it hasn't worked. No matter what you might say, they lack the vision for that final ball, they don't have the ability or pace to get defences worked up the way Holtby does.

That's my starting XI, and I think that's the best Spurs XI we have till the end of the season.",0,1359427973,null,0,false,0,c85dv63,t3_17h031,t1_c85dv63,t3_17h031,null,1431113988,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

I wonder how a man-tracking pressing system like Biesla's would work in the EPL. I don't think the league is as direct as it once was and it could work against some teams (Swansea, Liverpool) and not others (Stoke, other traditional English sides). Biesla's idea was to break up the tempo against Barca, which is critical to their style of play. Rodgers' Liverpool is similar in nature and a disruptive pressing defense should work well against them.

true,A_Rolling_Baneling,num26,,"I really doubt Siggy gets sold in the summer. He's young and still has time to develop. Also you pointed out that Dembélé is the most important part of our team, which I agree with. If he's to get injured, our other CMs can't fill his role in the team at all. I think Siggy could slot in there far better than Jake or THudd, who really can only back up Scotty. And Carroll's too young to be relied on like that. Therefore I think Siggy still has a role to play in our squad short term, and will likely be kept long term due to his age and skills. Also Siggy's looked decent at RM, a position where we only have Lennon and him as ready options. Also I think we keep on Dempsey for the depth at CAM/LM/RM/ST (I also think we should try him as well as our U21s at ST this February on rotation with Defoe during EL matches/last 20 min of matches) because squad rotation is good (I'm looking at you Harry) and because we have shitty options there with the temporary departure of Falqué and the youth of Townsend.
