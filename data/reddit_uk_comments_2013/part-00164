I believe it was the Olympiacos game that two of the goals were scored because Lucas broke up the opposition play and set up the chances to get to the final third. He sits in front of the defenders, so he's the first line in defense and the first one to start up the play. The day Gerrard retires(God forbid), I'm 100% sure that Lucas will take the VC position with Agger as Captain.

But in the US players have a LOT of leeway, but not in moving to other clubs, rather their leeway is in NOT moving to other clubs.  So owners are often stuck with players on absurd salaries and just have to eat it.

Joy! The system works.

But they you have to wonder, if you pick a random group of 30 or so men aged 18-30 anywhere in the UK, what are the chances you find some terrorism related material? I know if you raided my families house and seized the computer ten years ago you'd find troubling terrorism related material (because I looked at copied of Al Qaiedas manifesto once to see what they actually wanted and was... surprised), bomb making info (my brother was a tool and downloaded the anarchists cookbook which I shouted at him for assuming that we would be put on some government watchlist) and military training material (Because my other brother was interested in airsoft and paintball at the time and the whole military doctrine for the US army can be googled as it turns out).

Skrtel isn't a great fit in the system, and there are a lot of rumors of him leaving. Coates has hardly played, and it doesn't seem like the boss rates him anyway. Wisdom and Kelly can both play there, but have zero experience in the league as a CB.

I pretty much speak for all LFC fans when I say that Coutinho is the star we all have our eyes on.

I doubt it'll change your mind, but I can't agree re minimum wage because, well, in any economy in a state of recession/recovery there is going to be high unemployment, i.e high demand and low supply of jobs, meaning the price of labour will go down.

But on the 'poor' side of the massive rich-poor gap this country suffers from, that means that the cost of labour will drop below the actual cost of living, but these people would still work for half as much as they need to live - because it's better than working for nothing, *but that doesn't make it right*, just because they *will* work for that much, doesn't mean they aren't being taken advantage of.

I believe there are a lot of policies that they have that I'm not sold on, but at the same time they do bring up issues that no one is willing to address as they fear from being called racist.  No matter what the outcome of such a decision is, issues such as immigration / etc need to be talked about fairly and not just dismissed as racism or similar.

Our standing with the EU DOES need to be discussed, many of their laws do not translate well into the UK like it may in other countries and should not be integrated.  At the same time, close ties and open borders with other EU countries is a good thing.  Many who migrate to the UK would not have the same opportunities at home and they should be given the chance.

The main issue with this is that it leaves us with a surplus of unskilled workers, and thus often a lack of jobs, with the increase of automation also being another major factor.  People need to be able to learn new skills to find new employment, but I mainly see this as an attitude issue in many cases rather than a lack of learning resources.

&gt; But this new image couldn't conceal MI5's incompetence for long.

&gt; Because at the very same time that everyone was talking excitedly about completely invented moles, MI5 missed the real moles at the heart of the intelligence services - even though they were completely obvious, and almost screaming to be noticed.

&gt; Michael Bettaney worked in counter-espionage in MI5. He had been recruited when he was at Oxford university - where he had been an admirer of Adolf Hitler and had a habit of singing the Nazi Party anthem in local pubs.

&gt; MI5 did a thorough check on him - called positive vetting - and decided he was fine. Perfect MI5 material. Bettaney was then sent off to Northern Ireland to fight terrorism where he was wounded by a car bomb. He then had a horrible experience. Hidden in a cupboard he had to watch in silence as one of his informants was shot through the kneecaps boy other terrorists.

&gt; Bettaney came back to London a changed man. He decided that MI5 was both corrupt and incompetent. He started drinking heavily and told his colleagues loudly that he was no longer a fascist - but he had become a communist.

&gt; So MI5 decided to promote him. He was positively vetted again - found to be perfect MI5 material, and sent to the Russian desk.

&gt; Bettaney became more and more unstable. In October 1982 he was convicted of being drunk and disorderly. The next week he was convicted for fare-dodging. Finally MI5 did begin to notice - and two separate inquiries were set up to look into Bettaney's behaviour. But each was unaware of the other's existence.

&gt; Neither of them noticed that he had been stealing a huge amount of MI5 top secret documents and stashing them at his home. Bettaney was only caught when he took some of the best of these secrets and tried to stuff them into the letter box of the Second Secretary of the Russian Embassy - Mr Gouk.

&gt; Mr Gouk was so confused by this that, instead of passing them on to the KGB, he went round to MI5 and gave them back, and told them where they had come from. MI5 arrested Bettaney and he was put on trial.",0,1376069537,null,0,false,0,cbkck02,t3_1k0tln,t1_cbkck02,t3_1k0tln,null,1429887755,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Mignolet

Johnson/Toure/Agger/Enrique

Gerrard/Lucas

Asaps/Henderson/Coutinho

Sturridge

- well balanced team with a good bit of pace and youth, but not the most clinical in front of net though. Can have the tendency to look like world beaters one minute and then fall apart the next. Consistency will decide the season

- defenders that are all comfortable with the ball at their feet and can all make a run forward if need be. A big issue is how we defend set pieces though. I can't begin to count how many points we have dropped the last two years because of set pieces

- Fans will be looking at how Wisdom and Kelly develop this year. Both have played at CB and RB and seem very promising. Wisdom has looked stout at CB over the summer, and Kelly pushed Johnson to the left and Enrique out of the lineup before going down with yet another injury last season

- Borini is a huge question mark for a lot of us. Good energy and positioning but pretty rough with his first touch and finishing. He needs to prove himself this season

- a full season with a healthy Joe Allen will prove a lot of his ""he only pass sideways"" critics wrong. Him and Henderson are both very versatile and can cover multiple roles in the middle of the pitch

- Ibe and Sterling will both be fun to watch. At only 17 and 18 years old, they bring a ton of pace and energy to the side. Sterling needs to work on his final product (recurring theme with this team) but I can see Ibe having a much bigger impact than Sterling had last year, mainly because less will be asked of him

- year 2 of the Brendan Rodgers Experience. Definite progress has been made, but the big question is, has it been enough to keep up with the Big 3, Spurs, and Arsenal. Will tactical adeptness and team chemistry beat out big money? Hmmm maybe not this year, but next?

- a successful season for the club would be to win either the League or FA Cup and to stay within striking distance of the top four all year. I wouldn't be too disappointed with a 5-6 finish, but we must show improvement and that we are closing the gap between us and the top of the table",0,1376069613,null,0,1376071299,0,cbkcl4u,t3_1k19uj,t1_cbkcl4u,t3_1k19uj,null,1429887739,28,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,28

--------------------- Mignolet ------------------------

--------------- Lucas ----- Gerrard ------------------

----- Sterling ----- Coutinho ----- Aspas -----

----------------------- Sturridge ---------------------

-----------------------------------------------------
And with subs: 

Jones

Kelly

Skrtel

Allen

Henderson

Alberto 

Borini

-------------------------------------------------

We also have the likes of Ibe, Downing, Coates, Wisdom et al. to provide depth to the squad. Rodgers will continue his quick pass and move style this season, with the attack being centered on our boy wonder Coutinho. 

Aspas and Alberto, the new Spanish boys, both look quite skillful and have good positioning. While Alberto is a more of a direct and passing player, Aspas is more technical and skillful, and has scored in almost all of our pre-season games thus far. 

Coutinho continues to impress - this guy is just who we need to lift our hopes up and spur the attack. His pre-season performances thus far have been very, very good, and as I said earlier, he is the centrepiece of our attack, his fluid ball movement and pinpoint passing helping to form a great partnership with Sturridge; who due to injuries has just recently gotten back to training. I'm confident they can continue on last season's success. 

Allen looks to be having a return to form, with a particularly good performance in Gerrard's testimonial. After his dip last year, his passing seems to be as good as ever, and adds great depth to our midfield, proving a good replacement for Lucas. Henderson, on the other hand, seems to emulate Captain Fantastic, with his great attitude and desire to win. I can see him becoming a future captain if he continues like this, and, like Gerrard, can provide good balls to our attack, and is a good tackler. 

Defense is our weakest point thus far - we do have Coates and Skrtel to cover for our back four, but with their future's uncertain, Wisdom and Kelly, two good youth defenders, seem to be our safest bet. Kelly seems more trained to lead and shout, so is looking to become a good CB, while Wisdom covers our flanks better, and seems better as a RB. 

Then we have Borini, Assaidi and Downing, who also provide depth to the attack. Downing and Assaidi look set to be leaving however, and Borini hasn't been all that confident in front of goal thus far. I have no worries that he won't improve, but time will tell I guess. I feel he'll be used as an impact player in Rodger's squad. 

Ibe and Sterling have really impressed me this season - especially Ibe, who despite being 17, managed to put in a good game in front of 95,000 fans at Melbourne. The competition between him and Sterling this season is going to be interesting to watch, with both constantly trying to out do another, while having to play together as a unit. With these two leading Rodger's emphasis on youth, I have no problems about the future development of our squad. 

However, with the likes of City and Chelsea spending big money on overseas talent, I do worry about how we're going to compete for top 4 against the mega bucks. Highlighted by the recent Suarez debacle, it's going to be hard for us to attract talent without the safety of CL football. I feel we've actually done quite well this window, with Alberto, Aspas, Mignolet and Toure coming in. However, we need a marquee signing, a first XI player to make us a top 4 side. It's been frustrating being linked with Mhkitar-whatever, Papa, and Alderweid, with all these transfers falling short. Hopefully we can sign either Cisssoko, Papa, or Costa, but I'm not getting my hopes up. 

I think we'll finish either 5th or 6th this season, with Tottenham reaching fourth place, seeing as I've been quite impressed with their transfers thus far, and Arsenal falling short of signing (almost) anyone. Suarez could make or break our season - if he makes an apology, I'll be more accepting than most of the red fans in accepting him back into the squad. If he tries hard, and scores against Arsenal, then I'll be happy.

He doesn't have great pace and despite being a decent sized kid he isn't very good in the air.  He just isn't quite ready for Spurs.....i really hope i am wrong but he really has mid-table talent written all over him from what i have seen, a guy like Gary Hooper or Fletcher that seem to put up gaudy stats but you could never see doing well on a top team.  I think at a bare minimum i would prefer to see Kane on loan to a lower table PL team so we could see what he can do in the PL on a semi-regular basis without sacrificing quality at the striker slot in a chase for CL.

I am actually torn on who i would prefer to see go from JD or Ade.  JD only seems to light it up in the first half of a season and never seems to have mastered the offside rule but when he is on he is a ruthless finisher.  Ade when he is on form can be fantastic, but when he is off form or doesn't feel like playing he is just a waste on the field and last season about 2/3 of his appearances he just wasn't worth having out there.  Then there is his career history of being complete rubbish after he signs a contract.  But he can just be so damn good at times.  JD you know what you are getting for better or worse, Ade you don't but there is a huge upside.

I had thought the same as you that JD is a good impact sub but was reading the other day that statistically he is really not, something like 100+ career appearances as a sub with 10 goals for Spurs (still haven't been able to find the actual stats though)...last season he had 15 goals and 3 assists...yet he had 8 appearances with 1 goal and 0 assists as a sub. so he didn't do much last year coming off the bench for us.",0,1376069870,null,0,false,0,cbkcp0m,t3_1k167t,t1_cbkcp0m,t1_cbkbqaj,null,1429887689,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,EveryGoodNameIsGone,mcgann,McGann,"There are no ""season"" sets of classic *Who*, with two exceptions (seasons 16 and 23). Each season is comprised of stories that are usually 4-6 episodes in length (shortest is 1, longest is 12 unless you consider season 23 to be a single story), so each individual story is roughly movie-length as a whole. Because of this, the DVD releases are generally limited to a single story, sometimes two or three.

Also note that the BBC erased many tapes in the 1970s in order to reuse them/make room in their archives. Because of this, 106 episodes remain lost to this day, and as such there are a few stories from seasons 1-6 that no longer exist. Some DVD releases have animated versions of missing episodes to fill in the gaps.

There are also fan-made reconstructions that you can watch (the audio tracks for every episode exist, so fans have taken those audio tracks and placed still images over them to ""reconstruct"" the episodes), and the BBC has released the audio tracks as ""audiobook"" style CDs, with some of the original actors narrating action when there is no dialogue. (There are also some fan-made recons that use these audio tracks instead of, say, Loose Cannon, who uses the original, narration-free tracks, using scrolling text instead where necessary.)

The recons can be a chore to sit through, but if you can do it I recommend it. I did, and while it took me ages to get through the first six seasons, I think it was worth it.

I'm assuming you're in the US - I'm going to link you to Amazon.com listings for each story that has been released (there's only one or two that aren't on DVD yet) - THESE ARE REGION 1 (USA) NTSC RELEASES, NOT REGION 2 (PAL) RELEASES, WHICH IS THE ORIGINAL FORMAT OF THE SERIES:

(Also note that if there is an updated ""special edition"" release of a story, that's the one I'm linking to, as they usually have superior-quality video/audio restorations, particularly in the eras of the first three Doctors.)

No, they were not.  I was making a point.  I did not misrepresent what you had said.

&gt;You're trying to say that zero-hour contracts are unsupportable on the exact same basis as child labour is unsupportable.

No, you missed the point entirely.  Obviously, adults on zero hours contracts are not children.  So, it was blatantly not a direct comparison, as you claim it to be.  My comment was only to show that the same reasoning you used could have been used for child labour.  So, clearly, the reasoning is flawed.  

As workers are paid less, demands falls and the economy shrinks.

&gt;Apparently you're oblivious to that fact that these contracts have been growing as demand has slowly been increasing, and now appears to be growing more quickly.

Citation?

&gt;Further, demand doesn't necessarily have to drop as average incomes drop.

So, you do agree that it usually does and that lower wages should harm the economy?

&gt;Demand can come from other areas.

Like?

&gt;It's an unfortate side-effect of the economic policy that has been pursued by the government that average income has dropped since the recession, I have a feeling we'll see it rebound in the not-too-distant future though.

Why?  All indicators are that, if anything, we're heading towards lower wages, lower average standard of living and higher inequality.

Since the recession?  Wage have been suppressed since the 70s.

&gt;Zero-hour contracts do not necessarily imply 84% of people on these contracts think they regularly get enough hours, 86% think that they earn enough. That means around 0.3%-0.4% of the UK work force are financial unstable because of the contracts, these contracts are not the evil.

38% of part time workers on zero hours contracts think they're not getting enough hours.  14% think they don't get enough hours to provide a basic standard of living (above poverty).  This is not a good trend given how rapidly and widely these contracts have spread.  They also prevent people from finding alternative work.  Which is far worse and blatantly against the ideals of capitalism.

&gt;Protections should be introduced to prevent their abuse

Like what and how?

&gt;With that in, you concede that underemployment is better than unemployment.

Well, it depends of what the situation is.  If unemployment means you lose your home, then yes.  But, that's like saying getting kicked in the face is better than being stabbed.

&gt;These contracts reduce unemployment, mostly by creating employment though a small number are underemployed.

Citation?  How do you know these contracts aren't just replacing the conventional contracts?

&gt;One, it's only through employment that we can hope to pay for these benefits.

It's actually through taxes and taxes take various forms, not just income tax.  There's taxes on investments for example.

&gt;Two, France has a lower income than the UK and more generous benefits, it's not to do with a lack of 'bad' jobs that their poverty level is lower. It's easy to have a smaller percentage of people below an arbitrary percentage line when that absolute values being compared are so different.

[France has a higher quality of life than the UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-of-life_Index).  That is a meaningful statistic.  Average income is not, because it doesn't take into account the cost of living, taxes, etc.  A better statistic for comparison is the [purchasing power partity index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity), here also, France is ahead of the UK.

&gt;Oh I agree, and it's a goal best achieved by creating an environment where they can provide that quality of life for themselves rather than

Rather than what?

&gt;That model has been in place for well over a decade, it was in place when we saw the huge advances throughout the 00s and 90s. If it's so calamaitous, why did standards improve so much?

Debt, which hasn't exactly worked out very well.  We've hit a global economic crisis, the likes of which haven't been seen since the great depression, and you think we've never had it so good?

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"The thing is...none of our spending indicates that we are selling Bale just making the team stronger with smart moves.

Say we had Â£50m in the transfer kitty, we signed the following players

Soldado (Â£27m), Paulinho (Â£17m), Chadli (Â£6m) and Cappy (Â£9m) for a total of Â£60m

We have sold 2 players (Dempsey and Caulker) for a total of Â£15m.

That means we have spent Â£45m this summer so far and that is assuming we paid Â£27m for Soldado when we actually didn't pay all of the fee up front.  Of our signings Capoue, Chadli and PAulinho are likely to retain sell-on value, Soldado probably won't but striker was a glaring need to splurging for that slot is forgivable.

Then consider we are rumored to be moving Parker and Thudd who between transfer fees and salary could net an additional Â£10m, throw into the mix the other rumored out goings of BAE, Ade or JD, Naughton, Townsend etc and we actually could end up with a tidy sum of cash.

Now, Willian is of course going to be rumored with us because AVB likes him and wanted him and Anzhi are having a fire sale so its good copy for the media.  Unlikely that we are actually in for him though. Even if we are it doesn't mean that we are automatically selling Bale (i agree if we were to sign Willian i don't think it is a good sign though), remember we made more money off TV last season than Chelsea and i would wager that Levy and Lewis would like that to continue and we are going to push for CL.  This is a season where 3 top teams have changed managers and the fourth so far has done nothing to improve their team which finished 1 point ahead of us last season.  Just as reasonable to think that Levy and Lewis knowing that we finished with a record number of points just out of CL and with the top teams transitioning have decided to go for the throat and really chase the CL slot this season (especially with FFP coming into effect next year) provided the signings make sense it is the time to spend.",0,1376072075,null,0,false,0,cbkdmr8,t3_1k1bvh,t1_cbkdmr8,t3_1k1bvh,null,1429887252,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8

true,timhm,eng-kent,Kent,"&gt;House prices go up as well as down. Would I see a tax rebate if my property lost value?

No, you would pay less tax especially considering the fact that LVT is levied against the value of the undeveloped land, not the house/whatever that's built upon it. You'd also likely be better off in general because LVT usually replaces a significant part of income tax.

&gt;Would this replace the stamp duty which is already a massive tax on property?

Yes, absolutely.

&gt;And what about other appreciating assets? My mum collects antiques, should we tax those?

The reasoning behind a LVT is to pay society for exclusive use of a social asset (land) and encourage productive endeavour over asset hoarding and rentier behaviour. For example, if a tube station is built nearby your land would most likely appreciate massively, yet society (who paid for the tube station) gets little. A more relevant example might be the rise of buy to let, which has enriched few at the expense of many renters and first time buyers.

Instead of expecting immediate results from our new manager like in the previous season we would allow Brendan to assemble his team, make changes to the formation and playing style, sell players he consider to be a bad fit, experiment with our youth players and make sure we finished in an acceptable place in the table. 

Now the real test comes, he's had his transition phase he's brought in a number of young players to help boost the team and so far he's getting the best out of them receiving a lot of praise for bringing Coutinho and Sturridge into the side, while others have shown a lot of promise in the preseason leaving fans wondering just what else they are capable of. Although we're fielding a young side they and we as a team have a lot of potential, if we can correct the defensive mistakes that cost us last season and the kids can handle the pressure then we have a real good chance of becoming one of the most dangerous young and developing sides in the premier league.

A lot of Liverpool fans see a lot of similar philosophical qualities between BR and Bill Shankly, hopefully he can bring us similar success.

Whatever happens BR will be remembered for re-encouraging Liverpool's youth player revolution. 

-----------------------------------------

When I say developing I mean it from a potential standpoint, BR transfer policy was to buy young and relatively cheap, he's managed to do that so far with great results! the players in the pre season looked to fit in and we have gone 6 games undefeated only conceding one. All the 'developing' players i talk about are under 23 years of age yet already have a lot of talent, if they continue to progress at the rate then in a few years they may become the power house BR is trying to build..most liverpool fans are aware of our youth/young player plan but i imagine others are not so.

A problem that he faces now is getting them to continue to develop at this rate and handle the pressures and stresses of playing in big games, or keeping their heads up when they are down, something that young players develop over the years that these players may still be lacking.",0,1376072997,null,0,1376073674,0,cbke0px,t3_1k19uj,t1_cbke0px,t3_1k19uj,null,1429887072,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

That said, if you're wanting corrections - I can given you a few for bits of North Lancashire/Cumbria.

Trains still run on the Leeds-Morecambe line between Settle Junction and Wennington Junction - the current line branches off after Wennington towards Carnforth (with the Lancaster branch defunct). 

At Lancaster - the defunct NWR line from Wennington went through Lancaster Green Ayre and split - [with one route curving into Lancaster Castle (the only remaining Lancaster station) and one going towards Morecambe](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ithl4CW-KDs/Tnh9OqRAlAI/AAAAAAAAMZk/OL3sdVowVYs/s1600/Lancaster_%2526_Morecambe_Carnforth_RJD_14.jpg) - the line is still there the other side of Torrisholme Junction. 

On the Ingleton line - it's ""Middleton on Lune"" (not Lone), and the line joins the WCML at (now closed) Tebay station rather than after it as in your map.

The SD&amp;LUR goes over Stainmore Summit (not Stanmore). Also, you might make it clearer around Kirkby Stephen by rejigging it to realign your Settle-Carlisle line to cross just West of Kirkby Stephen East as well as at Appleby. 

At Penrith, it's gone a bit wrong - you could add the [CKPR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockermouth,_Keswick_and_Penrith_Railway) to the West, and there wasn't a triangle at Clifton Moor. [This map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Penrith%2C_Clifton_%26_Tebay_Appleby_RJD_058.jpg) is a good guide - the red LNWR is the only surviving line, now the WCML.

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"&gt;&gt; House prices go up as well as down. Would I see a tax rebate if my property lost value?

&gt; No, you would pay less tax especially considering the fact that LVT is levied against the value of the undeveloped land, not the house/whatever that's built upon it. You'd also likely be better off in general because LVT usually replaces a significant part of income tax.

If LVT is levied against undeveloped land would this mean that flat owners or those without any external grounds would be free of this tax? If so is that really fair?

&gt;&gt; Would this replace the stamp duty which is already a massive tax on property?

&gt; Yes, absolutely.

good to hear. the website mentioned it would replace existing taxes but wasn't specific on which.

&gt;&gt; And what about other appreciating assets? My mum collects antiques, should we tax those?

&gt; The reasoning behind a LVT is to pay society for exclusive use of a social asset (land) and encourage productive endeavour over asset hoarding and rentier behaviour. For example, if a tube station is built nearby your land would most likely appreciate massively, yet society (who paid for the tube station) gets little. A more relevant example might be the rise of buy to let, which has enriched few at the expense of many renters and first time buyers.

Looking at your example surely the benefit of the new tube station only comes at selling the property. You seem to be suggesting that LVT would increase because this tube station was built (correct me if I'm wrong). Say a pensioner has lived in a house for a long time near the site of the new tube station. Is it fair to tax them higher? They may never sell the house and see an financial benefit from the new tube station, but they'll be paying a higher LVT just because someone decided to build it near them.",0,1376073296,null,0,false,0,cbke58c,t3_1k0y7p,t1_cbke58c,t1_cbkdvs1,null,1429887012,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

How are they being taken advantage off? I keep hearing that but no one ever explains what they mean by exploitation. People are poor, so they value money more than a wealthier person does. While they would be willing to accept less for their labour, [the market requires that they be paid in accordance with it's value.](http://mises.org/daily/5934/)

And yes, the cost of labour may drop below the cost of living. But what makes you think the cost of living is fixed? If the purchasing power of the poor goes down then it will become profitable to supply lower priced goods and services. 

In a recession then yes, people will become unemployed. Why then is it better to make it harder for the lower skilled to enter the employment market? With no minimum wage the price the low skilled workers can sell their labour will go down and reach a lower limit (Due to the recession). With a minimum wage that lower limit still exists but if, for any individual, it falls below a pre-set level then they are forbidden from selling there labour. That individual now cannot work whereas if there was no minimum wage s/he could. Now they must live off other peoples hard work (welfare) rather than off his/here own; rather than being a productive member of society they are now a drag.

- He has been mysteriously injured for the whole of pre-season more or less, and when that injury heals, guess what, he has a foot injury now.

- No where, not once, amongst all of the rumours, AVB getting frustrated, the worry from the fans or the aggrevation in general has Bale even so much as tweeted ""I am staying at Tottenham, and have no desire to play for Madrid this season"".

- In fact, he hasn't said a word since the rumoured 85m+ bid/offer came in.

His head has been turned, of course it has. As much as we hate them, Real Madrid have come calling along with their huge pay packet and the opportunity to compete for the Champions League. 

The situation is pretty much this: He would *like* to go to Madrid, but he isn't exactly going to do a Modric or be ""distraught"" as the papers put it if he is playing for Spurs next season. If the price is right, as absurdly high as reported, and Madrid can stump up the cash (not credit), then I have no doubt they will allow him to leave.

I don't want Bale to leave, I'm very excited at what our squad could achieve next season with him AND our new additions. I know AVB has said he isnt for sale multiple times, but he doesn't run the club. It is what it is. 

What we can hope for is that if he plays the opening game, our chances of him staying are high. I don't think the club will be silly enough to allow our season to start and then significantly weaken ourselves by selling him 2-3 games in.

&gt; NI21 is a civic unionist party, as opposed to a political unionist party. It's the first I've seen in my lifetime. It will attract votes providing it gets recognition, or a chance to be recognised (re: speaking rights[1] )

I'm not speaking for all nationalists, but as someone living in west Belfast, i can tell you that i dont know a single SF or SDLP voter that would vote for Basil. Nor would they give their support to a party that labels itself as unionist, be it 'civic' or 'political' (whatever that means). Take a look at the Alliance party, they received less than 200 votes in the last West Belfast election.

I'd argue that it's perfectly reasonable not to trust a garage that has failed so spectacularly to be competent enough to complete the repairs. There's also nothing in the article to suggest that they even offered to make any further repairs. The judge dropped the ball on this one in my opinion.

Also, fuck the garage for being prepared to work up a Â£34,000 legal bill rather than just offer to pay the Â£25,000 for the repairs.

true,Frosstbyte,null,null,"10 was far more melodramatic in many ways than 11, but I think overall showed a greater range of characterization, emotion, and investment in his companions and the world.  The ways Rose and Donna (Donna especially) parted with 10 were big, earned, emotional moments, despite the fact that they each only had one season with him, and which resonate every time I watch those episodes.  I can't begin to say the same for the Ponds or, even worse, River Song.

Matt Smith has been an amazing actor to watch grow and he has truly embodied Moffat's vision of the Doctor as a madman with a box.  I have no doubt Smith will go on to do some amazing work in the future, and I'm glad we have a long career to look forward to.  The **problem**, however, is that the Doctor **isn't** just a madman with a box.  He doesn't (or at least hasn't always) lie all the time.  So having the past three series premised on, essentially, those two facts, has left a lot of anti-hero murkiness churning in the corners, and has changed the style and scope of the show dramatically.

RTD's run is far from perfect television, but there is a strong sense of morality and grand adventure that runs through even the bleakest episodes, when 9 and 10 are at their darkest and angriest.  The conflicts that 9 and 10 faced in their season finales compared to the conflicts faced by 11 in his season finales tell you everything about the difference in scope.  9 and 10 fought grand wars against insurmountable odds and with the help of companions, ingenuity, and a little luck, managed to save themselves and the universe, but at the cost of, usually, at least one companion, and sometimes themselves.

On the other hand, 11's conflicts have been intensely personal.  The pandorica sequence is much more a story about Amy being the special-est girl in the whole wide universe who can literally restart the galaxy with her memories, Rory being (admittedly really awesome) as the Last Centurion, and the Doctor being lost forever than it is a story about saving the world and humanity/the universe from destruction.  The Wedding of River Song, too, is much more a personal story about the Doctor's growth and his love life and solving the mysteries from ""The Impossible Astronaut"" than it has any big picture stakes.  To say nothing for ""The Name of the Doctor"", which is little more than a prequel/set up episode for the 50th anniversary special, and, again, is all about a Companion saving the Doctor personally, as opposed to the Doctor pulling the world together with a team to save the earth/the universe/etc.

I don't mind quiet, personal episodes, but I think the show focuses too much on them and on mysteries (who is River Song, who is Clara, why is Amy Pond so special, is the Doctor dead, etc.), at the expense of the Doctor being the best of us, and showing us what that can mean.",0,1376074429,null,0,false,0,cbkemix,t3_1k0n9s,t1_cbkemix,t3_1k0n9s,null,1429886788,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

As for banning the Niqab, I'm not sure it's a bad thing; I think people forget sometimes that this is the UK, and that multiculturalism means adapting to the culture of the country - the niqab is not a part of ours. In addition to that, when you consider that not two months ago, a man who did nothing but serve his country was butchered in the street, I don't think it's such a bad thing to make people a little more identifiable; there's absolutely no reason why these women can't reasonably be asked to adjust to a simple request to wear a hijab, so that we *know* that the people concealed under these clothes are who they say they are.

And please. Before you even *consider* quoting something like cultural diversity or religious right at me, bear in mind that I find niqabs more oppressive, and more detrimental to gender equality than *any* porn site or act of misogyny. The women who wear these robes are *entirely* subservient to the patriarch of their household.

It's possible that more lost episodes from Seasons 1-6 may be discovered, and if that happens they'll be released on DVD as well. Some more still may be animated in the future and be released that way.  But as it currently stands, that's everything.

I was legitimately, completely, 100% convinced that she was dead.

I had just started watching the show, I wasn't sure quite how companions worked, and I knew that 9 was regenerating at the end of the season so I thought maybe he'd be getting a new companion. So I actually believed when she was zapped by the Anne Droid that she was gone for good.

I was shocked, along with the Doctor. And sad. As they pulled him away with that horrified look on his face, I was right there with him, and as he sat emotionlessly there in that cell, I felt the same way. What did anything matter anymore, if Rose was dead? And then as Jack explained what he'd discovered, the realization dawned on me, as it did the Doctor, that Rose was still alive. And it was all brilliantly done and is still one of my favorite moments of the show.

And then Rose got a lot more annoying in season 2 and I didn't really care about her anymore (except for Doomsday, which still somehow managed to be devastating).",0,1376076819,null,0,false,0,cbkfll6,t3_1k1jvg,t1_cbkfll6,t3_1k1jvg,null,1429886334,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  If I were to drive it would cost me Â£24 in petrol in a saloon-type car.

This isn't the full cost of driving, though. There's the cost of the car, insurance, MOT, tax, maintenance, and the cost of getting your driving licence. These might not be things you have to pay every time you make a journey, but if you want to make a comparison it is important since they all have to be paid for before you get in the car. Just as you might include the cost of a railcard into the train price.

&gt; I will not delve too far into the world of train delays but I would challenge to say that the majority of train journeys you have undertaken recently have not been in some way delayed. Unfortunately I do no have to lie for dramatic effect when I say that I cannot remember taking a train journey unencumbered by delays, the reasons for which range from the banal (waiting for a free platform) to the idiotic (commuter train stuck behind a freight train).

Personally I can say that the majority of the trains I get are pretty much on time (within a few minutes of the timetable, in either direction). I commute regularly so use a lot of trains. Mostly First Great Western from Cornwall, Devon and Berkshire.

&gt; The trains that I have used in Europe had more than sufficient legroom, the tray tables were a useful size, each seat had its own power socket, they were faster and even one in Sweden was powered exclusively by renewable sources of energy. A trip abroad would highlight to you the inferiority of the stock used on British railways and the woeful inadequacy of the system as a whole.

Apart from renewable energy, I get all of this in the UK. I mostly use First Great Western and their HSTs give me all of that even in standard class. Compare this to, say, CrossCountry which has at-seat power (one socket per two seats though) but no legroom and terrible seat-trays that you can struggle to use a netbook with. FGW use heavily refurbished 1980s era trains, and they can do all of that.

I hope you're not comparing commuter trains in the UK to intercity class trains in Sweden.

We get some of your news, orders of magnitude more than you get of ours, but its almost all political. There are a lot of stereotypes about stupid americans who have no basic services and are fat and eat terrible food, and have no knowledge of the outside world and are crazy religious etc... While some of these are true I think most are not particularly the lazy-based ones, most people actually do a lot more stuff, particularly outdoor things like camping and fishing. 

The US is diverse but not as much as americans think it is, and certainly not as much as Europe (I mean try finding 1 similarity between Turkey and Norway). Also there is way more diversity within countries in Europe than there is within states.

Personally I couldn't live in the US long term, the dominance of capitalism worries me, the complete lack of employee rights (i.e. sacking someone without sustained gross negligence is impossible in Europe) and the demonisation of unions, the lack of holidays, the lack of maternity and paternity leave, the lack of paid sick leave, the health system is a joke, the culture around suing is unhealthy and the gun control (or complete lack of) is irresponsible and dangerous.

However, its a great country to visit or live in short term.

No, but you're talking about the HRA being repealed as something that's solely on the UKIP agenda; I'm merely pointing out that it *clearly* isn't the case, and I personally believe that repealing such an act could conceivably be the first step towards Britain obtaining a constitution that doesn't favour the monarchy, and the monarchy alone.

&gt;Firstly, countries don't have feelings, but more importantly are we talking about the same person that was deported despite the HRA still existing? Right.

Oh right. I see we've entered into the ""being literal just to be facetious"" portion of our debate. The man supported, and very probably sponsored terrorism in a country whose people sheltered him, fed him, clothed him and kept him healthy whenever he required a doctor. 

&gt;Ours? I'm not part of ""your"" culture I don't have an ""us"" and ""them"" binary mentality. You don't get to say what is and isn't acceptable cultural phenomenon, and that's a good thing because if it were left to the likes of you and you preferred party we'd be blowing smoke up royal arses, perpetuating colonialism, and polishing ""Golden Balls"". The real cultural artifact that needs to go is the Great British sense of righteous supremacy.

Well maybe you *should* - the problem with the UK today is that we don't expect people who come to this country to properly integrate, which is why we have a number of people that can't even speak English, and create a false economy by sending any money they earn on UK soil home. What's so terribly wrong with adopting the philosophy that both Germany and France have - if you live in the country, you adhere to to the rules and customs of the host country, including having the common courtesy of learning the language. I speak German because I lived in Germany; I speak French because I visited France many times, and I learned rudimentary Arabic and even Serbian because I went to those countries and didn't expect them to bend over backwards to accommodate *me* - why is it so absurd to expect the same in the UK?

This has nothing to do with British supremacy, but this has *plenty* to do with (for example) Middle Eastern culture being largely incompatible with the philosophies and ideals of a western culture such as the U.K.

&gt;Yeah, yeah, and we are saving the womenz from the evil Talibans as well. What you said is so brazenly chauvinist and pseudo-feminism it's unreal: ""the problem with these women is that they just need telling what to do!"". I'll tell you the real problem with immigration: abusers like the UK and the US make places in the world so inhabitable either by war or economic exploitation that people become migrants. If you don't like sand niggers moving in to ""your"" country perhaps fight against militarism.

Speaking from the point of view of ex-military personnel; I never agreed with Iraq. I never agreed with Afghanistan, and in my 36 years of life, I've never seen a conflict that was ever *truly* justifiable except Bosnia. I wish to Hades himself that in every example of incursions into the Middle East, we'd left well enough alone. This has nothing to do with the Taliban, but I'm actually fairly certain that you're not from a generation that remembers the fear and terror that the IRA wrought upon the U.K. - The damage caused by such people in Omagh, in Warrington, in Birmingham, London and in Belfast on a daily basis in the name of religion and ""unification"". 

Bullshit. It was never about religion, and it was never about Unification - it was about blood for blood; revenge, pure and simple, and the scars are left on the backs of people like myself who got to see first hand the kind of psychological and physical damage that campaigns of terror can inflict on the innocent, and people doing nothing more than *trying to keep the peace*.

I would rather *die* than see that kind of terror and Bloodshed return to *any* street, let alone my own, and if a requirement to live in relative security is to ask Muslim women to wear a hijab as opposed to a niqab, I *completely* support such a policy. It's easy for kids to say that it's unfair, but for the life of me, I'd rather they bitch and gripe about the deprivation of someone's religious right than experience a bomb explosion again in my lifetime in *my* homeland.

The Niqab is a prime example of just how different Arabic and Muslim ideology is to ours; I haven't suggested for a moment that it's backwards, but you know damned well that if we treated a Caucasian, English Christian family raised women in the manner that reports often tell us that Muslim society teaches us thanks to Sharia law, there'd be bloody uproar in the streets - nothing more, and nothing less. I have no doubt that there are good Muslims in the United Kingdom that *want* to meet in the middle road, but the people who point blank refuse to do so often are the same people that tell us that women wearing niqabs are a fundamental right.",0,1376079205,null,0,1376079481,0,cbkgk3r,t3_1k0qub,t1_cbkgk3r,t1_cbkfys4,null,1429885887,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"&gt; If LVT is levied against undeveloped land would this mean that flat owners or those without any external grounds would be free of this tax? If so is that really fair?

LVT is levied against the value of the land 'as though it were undeveloped'. You get taxed the same if you leave it rot, turn it into a scabby car park, built a sing floor cottage on it, or built Canary Warf upon it.

The tax is payment to the rest of society for having exclusive rights to use a very (or not so) valuable piece of land.

If you want to buy up vacant parcels and park them for 25 years while the rest of the community lay gas mains, bus routes, shops and schools then sell up when people are dying to use your land to built desirable housing, that's fine - LVT makes sure you've been paying society for your wasteful use of land.

In your example of the archetype poor old pensioner, there are two things to consider;

1) As land becomes more valuable because of the improvements the community build around it, it is almost inevitable more people will want (and need) to live there. As more people want to live in an area, this will manifest itself in the refurbishment and construction of higher-density residencies. While your pensioner is living in his fully detached single-floor bungalow, the properties around him are being turned into apartments. He is in effect blocking the use of the land for more productive use (housing more people), and as result he should pay for that privilege.

2) LVT is mostly an academic theory, and like all other taxes work arounds should be in place for those without the immediate money to pay the tax (for example putting liens against the cash sale value of a property in the future).

He came here from the DRC aged 10 and has now been in the United Kingdom for more than half of his life. The First-tier Tribunal found that he still enjoyed family life with his mother and two younger siblings who
are now aged 7 and 3 years respectively, both born here in the United Kingdom. They found as a fact that the appellant had some ties with relatives in the DRC but no higher than some extended family members, but the appellant has had no contact with them. 

&gt;It was accepted that the appellant has been in the United Kingdom lawfully for almost the whole of his stay. He came here on 9 April 2002 and claimed asylum the following day aged 10 and was granted extended leave to remain and from that, ILR. [1]

Honestly, deporting someone under those circumstances strikes me as unnecessary (maybe for a more heinous crime I would reconsider), and I'd be disappointed if we felt the need to deport him rather than just dealing with him in our criminal justice system.

**Our expectations** at the start of the transfer window was a comforable 4th place finish, and higher points than last year.

**Our expectations** will not change despite how well/bad the transfer window goes.

**Our expectations** are not the same as our **realistic chances.**

I don't think we will reach our expectations this year *at the moment* but this can all change. After all there is a third of the transfer window remaining.

However my point was nothing about what I feel Arsenal can achieve this year, it's about what our standards and expectations are this year compared to yours &amp; Spurs and this season we expect more success than you do.

I wasn't talking about our chances for what I think we'll achieve this year.

Please don't call me deluded because on July 1st 90% of Arsenal fans had the same expectations for this year. Don't call me wrong, because I'm telling you nothing but fact, not opinion. Our expectations this season will always stay the same. Whether or not we'll achieve them this season is a completely different matter.

I was born and raised in the Swansea area but now live in Canada and this is how I follow the team.

The Swans Player is a paid subscription service from their website that shows exclusive videos covering Swansea, however so far this season they've been uploading them to Youtube for free.  Hopefully they'll continue to do this as they've been posting highlights and goals from all the games so far.  Great to catch up on if you missed the whole game but who knows, maybe they wont be allowed to do it with PL games.

Men don't really get sexualised to the same extent. If they were no-one would bat an eyelid about seeing dicks in magaiznes all the time or even dick outlines.

Its not necessarily guys' FAULT so to speak but, we're at the stage as a society where its normal to see women wearing not much clothes, having legs and tits out, and in compromising poses and not for men.

I don't know. There's not enough about consent and ways of treating people fairly taught in sex education I think. I don't think violent porn should be a thing especially after having seen some because it glorifies the idea that the women don't have to enjoy it or that they can get to enjoy being treated roughly as a norm which when not accompanied by any education saying 'porn =/= real life' isn't great.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The diatribe railing against May is just a red herring. You invoked the HRA to protect the rights of a charlatan who would do away with the HRA. On one level that is hilarious but on another its totally depressing. Your point is also immediately refuted because he was successfully extradited, so you are either deliberately misleading or ignorant: you pick.

No, the problem here is that you're getting stuck on a singular point; you stated that Nigel Farage was dangerous because he wanted to abolish the HRA, and I simply pointed out that Theresa May wants the same; how is one any less dangerous than the other?

&gt;Well, no it's not actually because there is no such thing as ""Muslim"" ideology but ideologies. There's too much to unpick in your post really, like the ex-militant that felt so strongly negative about the Iraq war that he/she still went there, ""middle of the road"" fallacy, appeal to experience (not old enough), appeal to fear (bombings), appeal to nationalism (""my homeland"").

&gt;It's the biggest con of the last decade that we are under threat, we are not, at least not from islamo-fascism. The threat is raging inequality, fascism, and colonialism spurred on by the likes of Assange, Milliband and Cameron.

&gt;I've said enough on this, it takes a fool indeed to believe Farage is any true opposition.


It must be really, really comfortable to be you. You get to sit there behind your keyboard, moralising and judging, and yet the first time you want protection, you'll call on the civil and military services to intervene, because that's they're job. They're just soldiers. They're there to die, right? And my point about you being old enough is *entirely* relevant, because *you've never grown up with fear*.

In fact, the last part of your vitriol just shows how batshit insane you actually are; How the hell is Assange the bad guy? The man has done more to unveil clandestine operations that are *truly* detrimental to world peace than Edward Snowden did in a single day; the man gave the world a platform with which they can sneak behind the curtain for crying out loud. I agree that there is massive inequality, and I don't like it any more than you do; I promise, I really don't. As someone who saw Apartheid end and the Berlin wall come down, I don't think we've come far enough.

Farage, whether you like him or not, calls Cameron on his Bullshit on a daily basis, and provides counter arguments. I may not agree with most of his policies, but someone who does that to someone who apparently is so ready to introduce the concept of state sponsored censorship *can't possibly* be a bad thing.",0,1376080912,null,0,false,0,cbkh7zz,t3_1k0qub,t1_cbkh7zz,t1_cbkgzph,null,1429885577,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

no really it wasn't. The numbers in the conspiracy theory you link to just don't add up, I'll have to quote my response from six months ago when the 'Brown saves the world by manipulating the gold price' theory was last posted, because I can't figure out how to link to it via Alien Blue:

""gold was at $282 on 07/05/99 when the sale was announced, the lowest point before that being $273 in August 98, then you have to go back to the late 70's to get a lower price. I don't keep much data on gold, never traded it, but it doesn't seem like it spent more than 30-40 days below $282 from 1979 to the sale announcement in 1999. So the price was 3.2% above a 20 year low prior to the announcement, falling to $253 shortly after.

Anyone short two tonnes (64300 ounces) of gold the day before the sale was announced was down around $580,000 at most, assuming they'd shorted at the very bottom of the market. That's the kind of sum banks consider a rounding error, not a threat to their solvency.""

Plus set pictures have revealed that 10's Tardis was used for filming, so unless they officially acknowledge the deleted scene where 10 gives 10.2 a piece of the Tardis to grow his own, it makes more sense to have a past incarnation rather than a current incarnation. 

But that's just a personal opinion!

Certainly deserves to be locked up if he is guilty, so of course it is right that he was arrested when he came back to the UK. Probably not worth chasing him to the other side of the world, but certainly arrest him if he is daft enough to come home.

Nothing to make a song and dance about, though. Unless you are trying to distract the public from the fact that you intend to do fuck all about corporate avoidance.

Sony will quite happily charge you somewhere between 2x - 5x the cost of the TV for all the parts you'd need to assemble it.   The remote control alone (and lets be honest a universal doesn't do everything the puka one does) may itself cost Â£70+  which a store would have to add their markup too. 

Which is fine except you can buy a whole new TV for not a lot more than Â£70 (depending on size, delivery vs take home, etc.).   This is the reason why all those TV &amp; Video repair places went out of business in the late 90's and also remember that it's Sony/Philips/etc setting the base price for these parts:  they don't want you fixing the old one. 

As to ebaying spares &amp; repairs units (which I'm assuming you were intimating) I don't think your average person on the street would like trying to fix their TV themselves, it's true that in these days of LED's and LCD's that you don't have the flyback transformer but you do still have a 240v AC power supply inside the chassis and it won't be in a nice neat little box either.

You think it's unfair for the LibDems to be held to account?  They made substantial election promises and unsurprisingly to anyone went back on them.  To add insult to injury it turns out that when you scratch the surface of the LibDem yellow you find an oddly familiar shade of blue.

The LibDem get all the flack they deserve because at some point they forgot they weren't the bloody Tories, perhaps if they'd of actually kept the Tories on a bit of a tighter lead rather than going true blue and joining them in butt fucking the general populace people might not be so harsh on them.

true,generic_human_1979,null,null,"&gt; The idea that everyone should want to be on the house market is based on the assumption that the value of housing will generally rise faster than inflation / wages: otherwise investing money in housing is less profitable than putting that money in a bank account or shares.

Actually, most people will never be able to afford more than one home, so it's only a practical investment in that it won't leave them at the mercy of a landlord later in life when they're on a fixed retirement income... it's not really sensible to sell a house you live in. Any capital tied up in the property is only available in situations you hope never come about, such as if you have to sell it to move into a nursing home, or if you lose all your savings or other investments. For the vast majority, owning your own home offers security, not a financial investment they'll see any serious gains in. A land value tax as you describe will help people on the minimum wage, but only by fucking over many people who are only marginally better off, and some even worse (like pensioners).

&gt;The tunnel was originally opened as a single bore in 1897 by the then Prince of Wales, as a major transport project to improve commerce and trade in London's East End, and supported a mix of foot, cycle, horse-drawn and vehicular traffic. By the 1930s, capacity was becoming inadequate, and consequently a second bore opened in 1967, handling southbound traffic while the earlier 19th century tunnel handled northbound.

4 lanes of traffic are critical to traffic flowing in to London from the M25.  If that tunnel closes for any reason what-so-ever then for every 20min it's closed the tailback on the M25 grows 2 miles. 

Why doesn't London have a better traffic management system?  Because after the Germans had finished being, as it turned out, somewhat helpful in demolishing the city and blasting occasional holes in roads and railways we went full retard.  We rebuilt it exactly as it was before.   With the exact same capacity it had before because no nobody was ever going to own their own cars.

The only episode where Amy got some spunk was ""The Girl who Waited"", and in the end the gritty, fantastic, amazing old-Amy said that she'd rather be a young fool in love. He just sabotaged River, who's a great character, but could have been so much more amazing ! Her secret weapon is a fucking lipstick, how isn't *that* sexist ?
Just look at what he says himself in interviews (http://www.scotsman.com/news/time-lad-scores-with-sex-and-daleks-1-1394833) : ""Thereâs this issue youâre not allowed to discuss: that women are needy. Men can go for longer, more happily, without women. Thatâs the truth. We donât, as little boys, play at being married - we try to avoid it for as long as possible. Meanwhile women are out there hunting for husbands."" Together with ""women are needy"" and ""thereâs a huge, unfortunate lack of respect for anything male"".
Come on, guys, this is 2013 ! I'm 28, single, and only one of my friends is married with kids, although many others are in relationships. Just, what decade does he live in ? 1950s ?
That guy turned Amy Pond, who could have been a respectable companion just like the others before, into bloody fan service ! Said it himself : ""And thereâs a moment with two Amy Ponds in it. If youâre a red-blooded male surely thatâs enough! Youâve got Amy Pond flirting with herself.""
He also used the Mystical Pregnancy trope, 

As for racist... I'll skip the obvious absence of non-white companions since Mickey and Martha, *and* the white-washing of secondary characters (apart from the odd black CIA-man) compared to what RTD had given us. I won't even get into how they got the two of them to end up in a relationship. Rita ? What a stereotype, never got any depth, just skirts, smile, and oh look a colored girl, see, I use them too !
""Journey to the center of the TARDIS"", OK, 3 black guys just piling up stereotypes on African-American : loud, bullies, violent, not much thinking... Melody Pond also reinforces that stereotype : stealing a car and etc. Melody was kinda kickass, but keep in mind she was the *evil* River, and she just happened to be black ! The reverse would have been non-conformist, but know, they had to stick to clichÃ©s.
He is also downright despicable the way he portrays Strax, Eleven has no respect for him, always makes him the butt of some stupid joke, while Ten was all about how the Sontarans are kinda awesome.
""The Rings of Akhaten"" are just so full of neocolonialism and exotic fascination it makes me sick. There's no respect in the script for that civilization, just the Doctor calling their religion bullshit. 

And that's what makes me mad. I so love that show, and Moffat *does* know how to write a story, ""Name of the Doctor"" is just so well put, ""Girl in the Fireplace"", too... But he limits himself by falling back on easy narrative tropes, and, worse, he limits the Doctor, his witty wisdom and overexcited sensibility. And Matt Smith isn't that bad : he brings a much-needed humility to the character after Tennant's reckless flamboyancy. But he can only play what he's asked to.

The Cult were fucking atrocious at Sonisphere 2010. I was really disappointed ... I've liked The Cult since my aunt introduced me to their music when I was in my early teens.

Imagine you bought a house for Â£100,000. In 10 years the value of it is Â£150,000. You decide to sell it. The taxman says ""that's Â£50,000 profit! I'll tax that Â£50K at 28%!"". You then get Â£136,000 to buy a new house with.

Only trouble is, all the other houses went up in value too and the cheapest house available outside of that is Â£140,000.

A medium term buyer only gets a steep financial penalty that discourages them from moving (and makes it incredibly difficult to upsize if they're forming a family). What about someone who's been in a house for 15-20 years, has seen it go from Â£50,000 to Â£200,000? They're pretty much completely trapped, especially if they're now too old to get a mortgage.

The number of houses worth millions is tiny compared to those not worth millions so it really doesn't affect the averages as much as you believe it does. A 2 bedroom flat in the village I live in costs around Â£175,000.

&gt; your mum clearly hasnt paid enough if she can waste money on antiques, and what is absurd is your mother living a better lifestyle than is needed or even comfortable when there are hard working people who can barely make ends meet let alone put anyhting aside for their future, if she has any money left over for inheritance then she had more than she needed, and frankly it helps the economy and wealth redistribution to force inheritees to sell up. personally I'd tax 90% on inheritance but then I'm borderline communist so yeah

Wasting money on something that appreciates in value? Oh yes, much better she spends it on holidays and gadgets like I do so that she can't be accused of wasting it by having something to show for it.

You make it sound like she didn't work hard in order to earn the money she did. It seems like a rather strange envy you have for people who do better than you.

I don't see how it helps the economy to force people to sell up and put any extra money they have into the state. If anything it would dissuade people from actually trying to achieve more if they don't have anything at the end. You do realise that those who earn more pay more tax as well?

Have you ever lived in a communist country? I have and really it's not the utopia you might think it is.

The SNP are able to present themselves as a viable party without any reference to independence - in fact, lots of people who voted for them at the last Scottish Parliament elections are opposed to independence - simply because they're now the only 'mature' left of centre party operating in Scotland. 

Scottish Labour is viewed with deep suspicion since they consistently toe the unpopular London party line and seem to have given up fighting the Conservatives on most issues. The Conservatives themselves are almost legendary in Scotland, and the direction of public services in England (which don't affect Scotland since, for instance, the NHS is a wholly devolved system here) gives every other party a giant stick to beat them with and scream about the 'Nasty Party at it again.'

The Lib Dems are done, frankly. There isn't a constituency of unaffiliated young professionals 'for good things and against bad things' in Scotland to form their core, so their support has almost always been based on Students north of the border. I don't think further explanation is necessary there.

The Greens and Socialists both appeal to small demographics and have some degree of overlap with the SNP, but both are considered anti-establishment choices to one degree or another, so they don't seriously impinge on the left-wing vote.


Back in England, UKIP without the Europe issue to beat are essentially just Conservatives who thought the 'Nasty Party' had the right idea, and given the number of parties now trying to crowd into the centre-right it's unlikely they could sustain themselves as a serious party if the Europe issue is settled convincingly.",0,1376087686,null,0,false,0,cbkjnpo,t3_1k0qub,t1_cbkjnpo,t1_cbkajqk,null,1429884429,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

1. Where did river get the sonic? In the 50th? Because that mini-episode didn't really tell us much besides the fact that we're confirmed that the 11th Doctor is the last doctor she sees before she goes to the library. If that's the case, did 11 gift her one of her own? Or did he modify his because he was regenerating and give it to her? 

2. Donna has two kids when she's locked in the computer. River has three, who the hell is the third kid? Because two are the same kids that Donna had and the third one doesn't look familiar.

3. Was there a connection between Clara and River before she got saved in the hard-drive or after? I gotsta know!

4. Why does River still try to sync up diaries AFTER she finds out she's talking to ""The Donna"" and thus she's dealing with 10? Before he knew her?

true,Fyenwyw,welsh,Wales,"If you blindfolded someone a put them on a train and a coach they would be able to tell because trains have a better ride quality and intercity has on board catering facilities as well as first class. Road maintenance and energy efficiency is also an issue as there is far greater friction from a rubber tyre on a tarmac road than there is with steel wheels on steel wheels as well and road maintenance would be extremely expensive as HGV's and Coach's cause the vast majority of road damage which with the current system is subsidised by cars. This can only be partially brought down by using a concrete roadway which takes weeks to set and is detrimental to passenger comfort. Railways are significantly cheaper to maintain for heavy traffic as this is what they were originally purpose built for. I expect you get this argument from comparisons of BRT's to lightrail where BRT still comes up slightly short and is best measured on a case by case basis as one doesn't beat the other in all situations.

Rolling stock costs more initially but with an 8 car hst you need 6 coachs just to move economy class this requires 6 drivers and 6 prime movers and using 6 is incredibly inefficient when the same job can be done with 2 or even better 1 locomotive on electrified lines. For freight the business case is even worse as one Class 66 can haul 19 containers or 75 ton coal wagons which would require 19 lorries.

Although, morally, it is without doubt a person using cannabis is not harming anyone, and most likely not harming themselves either, and very often helping people with various medical conditions, laws stipulated by Government are enforced by pigs such as yourself (even if you do 'let the odd yoof go' - very kind of you, by the way) and upheld by Court.

No legal avenue exists to rescind this law. Any attempts have been thrown out by Court, which is the adjudicator of the Government's laws. The only means by which the witch-hunt against drug users may be ended is by Parliamentary vote.

So until such time as Parliament gets around to deciding dope smokers aren't to be criminalized - which would fall in line with current scientific evidence - countless cannabis users are hounded by the State.

The State is embodied by the pigs in the first instance (that's you, ""Officer"".)

Should I decide to smoke cannabis, I would want to do so without the interference of the pigs. To this end, I might very well like to not be carted off by the Peeler Pigs to a sham court and be tried by a Judge dishing out Government law - all with no regard for sensibility or ""common sense"".

In this scenario, the sensible thing to do might very well be to accept the punishment the State has to offer (albeit with no victim capable of being produced). Pigs roll up, armed with Tasers and batons, capturing hardened criminals like the Jamaican reggae fan or the first year university student.

Personally, I would prefer to arm myself and blast every one of the State's menacing aggressors to kingdom come. Fight fire with fire. Unfortunately, that would upset a lot of people, so I may have to ditch that idea.

I suggest you ditch your pig clothing too, and find a job where you don't have to subject innocent members of the public to irrational laws created by idiots in Parliament.",0,1376095806,null,0,false,0,cbkmbcz,t3_1i28kw,t1_cbkmbcz,t1_cb18vjv,null,1429883190,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

It absolutely blows my mind that anyone besides the terminally naive or power-crazy could possibly think that our government faces too many checks and balances. Here's a brief summary I've written previously of why we need the ECHR - feel free to copy and paste it if this bollocks comes up again.

--------------

The European Convention of Human Rights is so named because it sets down a series of minimal requirements that European states have agreed to be necessary for a fair and democratic society. Each of the specific rights it sets down is extremely reasonable and difficult to dispute.

Here are some of the rights infringements that the ECHR has prevented in the UK:-

* Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)
* Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)
* You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)
* It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK) (*Although it would appear not nearly enough...*)
* You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)
* The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)
* Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)
* The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)
* Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)
* Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)
* Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)
* Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).
* Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)
* If you're arrested and acquitted, the government cannot arbitrarily hold onto your DNA, which could never have been obtained were you not wrongly accused (S &amp; Marper vs UK)

The crucial thing to bear in mind here is that *in every single instance* the government claimed their behaviour was justified and defended its illegality. If we merely had a domestic Bill of Rights, there would be no external check to prevent it being modified whenever it inconveniences the government.

-----------------

As for the two main 'case studies' against the ECHR:-

1. The prisoner voting right has been hugely overblown by politicians. The ECHR simply requires proportionality, and no blanket policies - that is, there must be a *possibility* of *certain* prisoners voting (e.g. if you're in prison for 2 weeks on a petty offence, you shouldn't be denied the right to vote).

2. The Abu Qatada issue is incredibly sketchy. It only became an issue because the government was unable to scrape together enough evidence to convict him under our very broad limitations to freedom of speech, even though he would seem to fall within them. [It's been speculated that this is because evidence was ubtained under torture](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/i-represented-abu-hamza-in-his-extradition-proceedings-why-is-he-being-tried-in-america-8205879.html). It is *not* so unreasonable that somebody who has not been convicted of any crime can't just be deported to a regime known to use torture - imagine how easy such a power would be to abuse.

It's also worth remembering that the ECHR is totally separate from the EU and the ECJ, which are the bodies which impose economic requirements like fishing quotas.

&gt;""We cannot go on with a situation where people who are a threat to our national security, or who come to Britain and commit serious crimes, are able to cite their human rights when they are clearly wholly unconcerned for the human rights of others.""


Yet again, they are going with the spiel of 'foreigners and terrorists'. 

One of the main contributors towards the anti Human Rights Act movement was the Abu Qatarda case. Now, a lot of newspapers, other media sources, and politicians made it out that we should be able to send him back to Jordan, but the HRA was stopping us. Now, why exactly were we stopped? It was because in Jordan, he was at risk of being tried on evidence gained from torture. Is this the sort of society we want, where we can send people off for unfair trials just because we don't like them? Is this justice? I don't think so. 

But 'rabble rabble bloody foreigners send them home', right.

And, another interesting part:

&gt;are able to cite their human rights when they are clearly wholly unconcerned for the human rights of others

Isn't justice supposed to be blind? Should we judge people by a different rule book just because of their social believes? As soon as you start saying stuff like this, you aren't looking for justice, you're looking for revenge. 'You don't believe in human rights so I won't respect yours'. 

I'm really worried about this talk of changing the HRA. Yes, there are flaws, but I'm worried the government would abuse it, and use it as an opportunity to give people unfair trials and send people away to torture or death. This is a government who has removed workers rights, and has reduced the amount of legal aid people can get. Do we really want them to messing around with our Human Rights as well?

The deportation argument came to the fore because of the strange limbo that certain suspects were in. Foreign nationals who could not be deported because they would either be in fatal danger or at risk of being tortured or subject to trial where evidence was obtained by torture. The main idea to drive home here is that Britain does not want to lock up dangerous people here when it can do it elsewhere. But it was Strasbourg in Chahal v UK that extended the Art. 3 right to freedom from torture or inhuman or degrading treatment to include a ban on deportation to a state where the deportee could be at risk of torture. Basically, those who want to repeal the HRA want to do so because they don't like outsiders deciding on domestic issues. They can't object too much to the ECHR because it was drafted mostly by Brits!

But if they believe his development will not be hampered significantly by playing with the U21s and the occasional first team game, then it makes sense to have him become club-trained ASAP.

Let's say we had loaned him out this season and he progressed well.  What if next season there still wasn't a place for him in the first team?  He's now outgrown the U21s for sure so he'd have to be loaned again.  Rinse, repeat for one more season.  Now they're stuck having to make the decision to keep him and have him not play much at all as a 20 year old or loan him again and there goes his club/country-trained status.  There are too many variables going on to not make this decision now.

Right now, he can still progress in the U21 league.  After this season he's achieved his club-trained status and we are free to loan him out the next one or two seasons without having to worry.

They have shown numerous times in the last decade that they've changed and become far more interventionist. The president of the supreme court spoke out openly of his dislike for closed material procedure (now enacted in Justice and Security Act 2013). The judges would not allow any Bill of Rights to be used and abused the the government. They haven't got the power to explicitly repeal sovereign Acts of Parliament but they can interpret them and read down provisions. Also, a Bill of Rights laid down by Parliament would be on the same hierarchical footing as any other Act whereas now the ECHR is international law and in essence one level higher.

 The HRA is good now because it does effectively (or not depending on who you believe) give the courts this power. Any Act that is incompatible with the rights listed in HRA from the ECHR cannot be quashed but the judges can issue a declaration of incompatibility and refer it back to Parliament. The pressure is then on the UK to do something or face fines from the Council of Europe. 

Also, the rights in the Convention aren't what concerns the Tories, it's the ability of Strasbourg, an external foreign court, to rule on domestic issues and overrule domestic decisions. It's pure nationalism which, I don't think at least, has a place where human rights are concerned. They are universal.

The following **includes** oil/gas revenue

* [UK is 20th - 22nd globally](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita) (depending on who you ask)

The following  **excludes** oil/gas revenue

* Scotland's GDP/capita is Â£23.4k approx, 2nd highest in UK after London/SE

The above figure is based on approx [20-21k GVA](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-accounts/regional-gross-value-added--income-approach-/december-2012/stb-regional-gva-2011.html) + some additional data from national accounts and the labour force survey to calculate GDP. This figure is not, and as far as I'm aware has never been, in dispute.

* **Scotland's GDP/capita (without oil) is already about the size of France or Japan**

It's slightly lower than the UK average even though we're the second highest GDP/capita region in the UK because London is so much higher than the other regions (Â£35k approx). This pretty much tells you all you need to know straight away. It tells you Scotland is already a wealthy country and is more than capable of looking after itself.

If you throw in oil/gas revenues Scotland shoots above the UK, France, Japan and into the *top 10* globally for GDP/capita. Yes oil/gas doesn't last forever but so what, theres at least 50 years left and that's a great chunk of cash to invest in the future. And then when it runs out, we'll still be a wealthy nation anyway, a classic win/win.

**warning, impending loss of temper and rant, apologies up front**

&gt;but I'm not convinced that our nation has the financial ability to go it alone.

So can Scotland afford to be independent? of course we fucking can, the very suggestion that we couldn't was moronic to start with. We're already wealthier or as wealthy as many other successful, thriving and vibrant nations. When faced with the simple facts above, ask yourself why did you question the possibility in the first place? The answer to that is of course because the doubt was placed in your mind. Nobody walks through Edinburgh thinking, fuck me if it wasn't for all the Westminster money this place would fall apart. No, the doubt is being placed in your mind by a carefully orchestrated campaign of misinformation.

Only a propaganda machine would try to tell a nation that is already very wealthy, having oil revenue on top of that would be a *bad* thing; yet almost daily we are told by the anti-independence campaign that oil is running out and the price is volatile, so your better leaving us to deal with all that oil. So fucking what? Having oil is better than not having it, end of fucking discussion.


**Banks**

We're often told by the anti-independence campaign that an independent scotland couldn't afford to bail out the ""Scottish"" banks like the Bank of England and treasury did. 

First of all that's utter bullshit, the bailout from the UK was circa Â£125b, which is less than Scotland's GDP so it wouldn't be pretty but it *could* have been done. It never would have come to it though, ever, and heres why below,

This part is always glossed over, the banks would have been bailed out regardless because it's only their head offices that are Scottish, their investment banking and general fuckwittery divisions are licenced, based and regulated in London. If their headquarters were in Antarctica they would still have been bailed out because 90% of their transactions and business was done in London, 80% of their high street banking done in England.

Third, and this is the real fucking doozy that Darling and Osborne will **never** tell you about. The Bank of England and the Treasury actually couldn't afford the bailout anyway, why?, because the full bailout is much, much bigger. Lets take RBS and HBOS, the [full RBS and HBOS bailout required to keep them afloat was approximately $915 billion](http://www.scribd.com/doc/60553686/GAO-Fed-Investigation#outer_page_144). Yes you read that correct, that's an eye watering sum of money. Almost a trillion dollars. But we're not done yet. Remember we were told by Darling/Treasury that Barclays didn't need a bailout? Yep, you guessed it, utter horseshit. Check the table above, Barclays needed the biggest bailout of them all.

So that's RBS/HBOS $916b + Barclays $868b = $1.78 trillion = **Â£838 billion**

You think the treasury and BoE had 800 billion and change lying around to bail out the banks? Of course not, the NY Federal Reserve to the rescue. But remember the thing about where the banks operate and why they get bailed out there? So that's why anything from Darling's, Osborne, Moore's mouth on banks and bailouts is almost always utter horseshit.

Lastly, if we're so much better together, why they fuck are they calling them Scottish banks and not British banks? Barclays was *fucked* but was it ever referred to as an English bank? No of course not, Barclays was the British bank that didn't need a bailout, well not from us anyway cos the treasury couldn't afford it ;)


**Financial Sector**

Well this is the end of my rant cos there's no whisky left. The anti-independence campaign and Michael Moore and the Treasury have been trying to say that Scotland has too much reliance on it's Financial sector, it's too high a percentage of overall GDP, and that's a bad thing. Forgetting that that's a bit hypocritical because *their* financial sector fucked us all I would go off on another rant about the differences between the London casino banking and Scottish life assurance, asset management and so on but I'm too drunk. I hope theres someone from one of the Edinburgh financial firms reading this, I'd love to hear their thoughts on how much of a supposed liability their company is to Scotland's finances ;)

Instead I'll just say that [Michael Moore can shut the fuck up and go and argue the point with Luxumbourg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita)

Glasgow, our largest city, has the lowest life expectancy in Europe, 1/4 children living in poverty, in some areas 50% of the children are living in poverty. **That is not ok** and 50 years of successive Labour/Tory westminster governments have failed to fix that.

Europes largest concentration of weapons of mass destruction is parked 30 miles from our largest city. **That is not ok**.

Tony Blair took us into an illegal war in Iraq despite over 1 million UK citizens marching against it. 85% of Scottish MP's voted against the Iraq war and we still got dragged into it anyway. Do you know the international legal term for the leaders of nations who wage war illegally? It's **war criminal**. Over 100,000 Iraqi men, women and children are *dead* because of that illegal war. **That is not ok**

There are over 800 *unelected* members of the House of Lords, these men and women decide how our lives will be governed, they decide who will be prosecuted as a criminal, they change and create our laws all the time and *none of them* were voted for by the UK public. Worse, they can do this until they die, and even worse than that (how could it be) some of them get to pass this privilege on to their children. **That is not ok**.

You can't be mad at Suarez for wanting to play Champions League football, but you can be mad at how badly he has handled himself in the situation.  He's acted like a child, which when you think about it, is the core problem with all his behavior issues.  At the same time though I honestly think part of what makes him one of the most talented players in the world on the pitch is his very child like approach to the game, coupled with the size, speed, and experience of an exceptionally trained adult athlete.  He's tireless on the pitch because he enjoys every second of it.  Every detail of the competition is in his mind a whole new game for him to explore and win.  The big problem for Suarez is that his skill on the pitch has led to him getting his way off the pitch many, many times when he shouldn't have.  I think the best thing that could have happened to him, that he's not getting his way now, and in a way his football is being denied him.  I wouldn't be surprised if half the reason he wasn't angling for a move to La Liga was to get out of the rest of his six match ban with the FA and get on the pitch sooner. He's not a bad apple.  Just a spoiled kid who needs a bit of discipline, and I think BR has shown himself capable of providing that discipline.  Because Suarez communicates on the level of a kid and because of other cultural barriers he's often misunderstood, and I think he's just come to expect it and decided he's not going to bother trying to make the situation any better.

Getting a really good heat gun, flow solder rig and the various odds and ends you'd need to replace the chip are going to be much bigger problems than cracking the case.  Considering just how much fake stuff is now in various channels you might need several attempts just to secure a legit and working chip; so you could well be replacing it 3 - 4 times just to fix the same fault properly.

In stuff that's sealed (like the iPhone) you can't even realistically let Joe Public loose to replace the battery.

That is, there's a systematic bias.  Just a simple example of this, men and women use drugs at about the same rate (according to self report use surveys), men are slightly but not substantially more likely to experience problems with addiction (according to data from treatment services, which are about 3/2 or 2/1 from memory), however arrests rates for possession over-represent men at a ratio of something like 8:1.  This is largely because (young, minority) men are far more likely to be stopped and searched than (old, white) females.  We all know about targeting, we all understand that police focus on known offenders and what they believe, sometimes with a scientific basis, sometimes not, are the primary offending groups, but here you have an unintended consequence which wrecks lives unnecessarily.  And that's just one small example of the wider issue of [the politics of policing](http://www.wsm.ie/c/anarchism-policing-law).",0,1376108105,null,0,false,0,cbkq4nd,t3_1jyeih,t1_cbkq4nd,t1_cbkenao,null,1429881410,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That said, the FIRST MATCH I witnessed was the 2006 FA cup final. It was like fate. More could be said, but anyway: I put my bid in with BR.

I'm going to espouse a somewhat unpopular opinion here: Between Benitez and BR, BR is the superior manager.

Rafa was excellent, a fantastic tactician, but I felt that at times, he was almost fanatical about his views towards the game, unyielding in his approach, too adamant on a single, brilliant strategy at times. So much so, that if a team had us figured out (which incidentally, I felt was the case after the second season with Torres), it was only the individual brilliance of Torres and Gerrard that would win us a match. Granted, I know much more about football tactics and strategies now, but I still knew when we were over-reliant on a few players. When Torres was injured and N'gog was covering, I had the feeling Rafa was too rigid to adapt play to the players he had at hand. I feel like a truly masterful manager would be able to adapt his play to the players that he has to work with.

Which is where BR takes the cake.

There has been tons written about BR's philosophy and system of play, but one thing that strikes me is the *adaptability* of his tactics. Our back line was shaky and he didn't quite have the players at his disposal to fully adopt his philosophy... so instead of forcing his players to become something they're not, he tweaked it. Instead of a high-pressing possession game with a 4-3-3, we adopted more of a deep-lying 4-2-3-1, utilizing Sturridge's pace to set off tremendous counter-attacks and direct, penetrating plays. He recognizes different strengths in different players and has the testicular fortitude to play them in positions to bring out their best. And once he has a full chess set to play with, I'm positive that BR will create something special.

So a summarizing **TL;DR:** Benitez was a great tactician, but too rigid. If a single piece were missing from his puzzle, his system could fall apart. BR displays a lot more flexibility that you need in the modern game. For me, BR takes the cake.",0,1376110214,null,0,false,0,cbkqq62,t3_1k2chp,t1_cbkqq62,t3_1k2chp,null,1429881059,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,kopking08,null,null,"I think I've never been behind a manager as much as I was KD. I became a fan (of football and LFC in general) the year Rafa was appointed. But despite the success we had under him and the chances at winning the Prem, I never felt a connection to him. He always seemed a distant figure. Both to the fans and to the players. His man management never impressed me and thats something I rate a manager for to a high degree. Recruitment is often out of the hands of the manager, but handling the players is what you're known for. I never felt Rafa got the most out of the squad. Even when we got 2nd, it felt like it was solely on the back of Gerrard and Torres. 

I didn't see Kenny's more successful years, but if his recent spell was only an echo of that success, it was obvious the effect he had on the club and the supporters. I went into every match ready for a battle. Behind the players, the manager, and the club. You could feel the players respect for Dalglish. You felt like they were fighting for him at times.

He picked up the club in a rotten spell and it would have been an insurmountable task for nearly any manager who wasn't given time. He got us to two cup finals and that, to me, was a massive achievement. It created excitement in an otherwise dull season.

But at the end of the day its been BR (and FSG for that matter) that have me believing there is a sustainable model in place to move forward. We've been off the plot for so long now. We don't have oil money. But I don't want it. And Brendan seems to have become invested in the ethos of the club that he doesn't need it. 

Money makes everything easier. But it certainly doesn't allow for the same satisfaction in victory. Brendan has shown up at a time that our investment into our youth team is finally starting to show dividends. How can we forget that for years we had hardly a single youth product come into the squad and challenge for a place? Now they're doing so. 

I, for one, have never felt so good about our direction. If Brendan can avoid some of the tactical mishaps (and misplacement of confidence in certain players in certain formations) of this past season, I can see us moving full steam ahead.

true,Samjez,mccoy,McCoy,"So, Doctor Who is a show that's been on forever (at least it feels like it...) It is, to date, the longest running Science-fiction program. This year marks it's 50th anniversary. Simply put, Doctor who is about an alien called ""**The Doctor**"" who can travel all of time and space, with his spaceship called the TARDIS. (It's an acronym for *Time and relative dimensions in space*) He usually has humans as ""companions"" that help him on his travels, as well as tools such as a ""Sonic Screwdriver"" that helps him in a pinch. There is a plot, but with the concept of time travel it can get a bit messy. Not to worry through, as most episodes you are able to drop in and understand what's going on; one episode you could be on a distant planet interacting with aliens, and the next episode he could be pulling shenanigans in the past with Shakespeare and the like. 


Eventually, the actors who play the Doctor either get tired of playing the roll, or BBC fires them, or *hell*, a meteor falls on them killing them instantly. The show compensates for this by subsequently killing off the Doctor. But fear not, fellow TV watcher! The BBC have ever so cleverly devised something called ""**regeneration**"". Since our Doctor friend is an alien, he has this special trick. If he dies by radiation, or by being shot, or anything really, every cell in his body changes to the point where he is a new man, with a new personality and everything! Don't be fooled, he's still the doctor, he's just... different. It's how they keep the show running for so long, and with different actors.


Doctor Who is usually classified into two sub catagories. ""Classic Who"" Which had it's run between 1963-1989, and ""NuWho/New Who"" Which started up again in the year 2005 after a nasty Hiatus. Most people talk about NuWho, But there's always people who love the classics. 

So, there's two options that everyone considers when jumping into the series. 

**Option 1: Rose (2005)**

I see a good 60% of people say that the best place to start is at the beginning of the NuWho series. This Season (series) Starts off with the Ninth Doctor; he is played by Christopher Eccleston. Starting here gives you a little bit more backstory to work with (although you don't need much for a while...) This version of the Doctor is much darker then normal, so if you are into that... I should also mention that the CGI is, well... for the longest time Doctor Who's budget has probably been some sort of Jam jar filled with bills and coins and the staff always take beer money out of it. It's that bad. If you can handle that thing, this isn't a bad place to start.


**Option 2: The Eleventh Hour (2010)**

Choosing this option gives us our current and 11th Doctor, Matt Smith. This Doctor's personality is incredibly childish, it gives us more a whimsical vibe then ever before. The CGI is a bit better, there's a new main writer, and it's a little bit more user friendly in general. Starting with this episode, however, gives you a little bit less backstory of who the Doctor actually is. You also miss out on the fabulous 10th Doctor (played by David Tennant) although you can also watch out of order... Kinda like the Doctor's timeline. We have seen nothing of the new 12th Doctor, Peter Capaldi.

**TL;DR: Doctor Who is a Science Fiction that's been running a while, and the two best options for entering the series and understanding what's going on are [Rose](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0562992/) and [The Eleventh hour](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1577256/).**

true,Mik0ri,mcgann,McGann,"It's stated a couple times in the old series that ""a Time Lord only gets 13 lives"". Multiple stories with The Master as the villain are centered around the fact that he already used all his natural regenerations and is now stretching his life out in some obscene biology-warping manner. 

However, canon is loose in the Whoniverse, and the limit was never explored in depth. We were never told whether it was a biological limit or a law the Time Lords enforced, for example. As some media says Rassilon invented regeneration, it is possible both are true. It is also not fully explained how ""regeneration energy"" works - whether the end of your energy signals your last life, whether using it for extra things wastes your lives, whether you can get more, etc. 

The Time Lords ""brought [The Master] back"" to fight in the Time War, and he regenerated again after that, despite having no lives left before these events. This implies the Time Lords had some capacity to ""hand out"" regenerations, but ambiguity surrounds these events and the Time War in general. 

Many people believe that due to certain events in the Doctor's past, and due to the fact that the BBC has no apparent intention of ending the show, that the Doctor has in fact beaten the limit and can regenerate infinite times, or a significantly larger number of times. 

Popular extension theories include:

1. The Doctor's resurrection in *Let's Kill Hitler* transferred enough regeneration energy to him that he now has ""extra"" - assuming the energy works this way and that it wasn't all needed just to resurrect him. 

2. Now the Time Lords are dead, the limit is no longer enforced. 

3. Events during the Time War gave him extra - either the Time Lords gave him extra regens so he'd be a better soldier, or he stole/""inherited"" them. ",0,1376112017,null,0,1376113086,0,cbkr83b,t3_1k2h1c,t1_cbkr83b,t1_cbkonqd,null,1429880827,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Anyway, so; look: even the librarian I flirt with when I go to St. Paul has shown me the word EMBARGO on the computerized book lookup/preorder/advance status system, running on some old green-screen mainframe or midrange server. For some reason, we're supposed to be able to get new titles about high-technology from say, Oxford Press, but *for some reason*, other people studying some of the things I study in other countries outside the United States have a) earlier access to the newest research, b) a huge head-start in setting up other forms of Information Embargos against myself &amp; my countrymen, c) secret alliances have been formed to basically play 'Pickle-In-The-Middle' with books containing information that will either help me fail faster over time ( not necessarily a bad thing ) or will help me fail successfully, in a spectacularly horrific way. Not ruling anything out.

It scares the hell out of me that other countries have lost *so* much faith in the United States that they actually *delay* the release of highly technical or speculative research tomes. Information Embargos are _serious_ business; without access to current state-of-the-art findings of fact in the various sciences, mathematics, bioinformatics, radial chromatography, well, the list goes on &amp; on.

Either way, it doesn't take many of the aforementioned factors to make one feel isolated, alienated, alone, &amp; ignorant. Whether it's because I'm not fluent in Microsoft Foundation Classes &amp; therefore I don't get free Windows NT Internals Bonus DVDs with all sorts of cool 'sonic screwdrivers' included, or because the Navajo &amp; Hopi guys decided I'm not kewl enough to include in their more 'advanced' converstations, is no matter. I'm still going to be trying to catch up to people that are *truly* bi-lingual, tri-lingual, et cetera. Colloquialisms, idiomatic speech, &amp; god only knows *what* else has been developed to enforce Shibboleth Rule, if you catch my drift.

Consider M.A.S.H.'s Radar tapping out a few sentences of Morse code with his pencil to save the entire regiment from being brutally sacrificed.

it is impossible in my view to work so hard that you deserve enough access to rescources that you dont need that you deprive other people of any chance to earn their share. it's precisely because so much money has been saved up by older people and by corporations that people are so hard up for money right now.

no it would discourage people from trying to earn more for doing literally nothing. money should be earned, not appreciated because you lived in a house for a certain amount of time and wont give it up to the next person who wants a place to live unless they gives you more than they can really afford for it.

&gt; those who earn more pay more tax as well?

I love this argument, because 90% of the time the money they are paying tax on has been achieved by exploiting other people in the country in some way, if you take Â£100k as a wage for a company that doesnt have a direct benefit to society, you give Â£40k back in tax, the economy in general is still Â£60k worse off unless you decide to spend that all up quickly. now dont get me wrong if people earn more they deserve more, I just think theres a level where anyone is getting more than they deserve no matter what job they're doing

Your wages have a maximum and a minimum. The maximum is the amount of profit you generate for the employer, the minimum is set by supply and demand.

An employer may desire to pay you below your market rate. However, he would be unable to do so as other employers would simply offer to pay you more. *All* labour is scarce; the supply is fixed (mostly, in reality the supply just changes very slowly). So wages are mostly set by demand: demand goes up, wages go up. Demand goes down, wages go down.

It really shows the lengths you'll go to try to stick the knife at the police every chance you get. Lets ignore the actual story, lets ignore the disorder, instead, lets question the number of police officers injured because that 1 time 5 years ago somebody didn't get the figures right!

Regardless of this, I am not saying that people should *not* have human rights. Of course they should! And I think the rights stated in the human rights act do set a good starting point. I feel that the problem with the current set of rights is that it grants people the right to take advantage of the judicial system and other liberties we have in the UK. 

I know that the cases (as said in the top comment) against the act are more than likely blown out of proportion, but I feel that they do identify a huge weakness. 

The one case I seem to recall is the case of prisoners having the right to donate sperm to their partners whilst in prison. I seem to remember that a convicted murderer arguing his right to donate his sperm to his partner whilst he was serving his life sentence. Now, of course every man and woman *should* be able to reproduce. But under the circumstances of the man in question I feel that some precedent should be set. If you go to prison you should accept there are things you can and cannot do. The case of prisoners having the right to vote I find about difficult - there are times when they should be able to, and times when they shouldn't depending on their offences IMO. My general point here is that no individual sentenced to a term in prison should be deemed to have fewer rights as a human, but they should have fewer *civil* rights as they have been removed from society for a reason.",0,1376129264,null,0,false,0,cbkuabn,t3_1k239g,t1_cbkuabn,t1_cbkmey3,null,1429879398,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"&gt; ridiculous outliers drag any average up. I dont know where you live but Im guessing it's the south? some rich white village isn't typical of the whole country

Oh yes, every village in the south east is just full of rich white folk. You can't move for Bentleys and Rolls down here. Sorry but that's just nonsense. I can safely say where is live is neither rich nor white.

But let's take tower hamlets. Average flat price is Â£332k. That's in the 3% stamp duty threshold. I now welcome you to claim that it's rich or white.

&gt; not holidays or having a decadent retirement give it to a good cause. rich ass antique dealers are not a good cause.

Again you seem to assume that everyone involved is rich. My mum didn't earn a lot of money, but she was very careful what she spent and her hobby was antiques. Unlike my hobbies of photography, travelling and gadgets hers actually return something more than memories and mosquito bites. The idea that she should be rewarded for using her money wisely by having it taken away from her is just bizarre in my opinion. 

It seems to me, maybe I'm mistaken, that to want to dictate what people should spend their money on. That people shouldn't be able to have interests that other people can't afford. Frankly I'm glad I wasn't born in such a country. It would be an economic and intellectual waste ground.

&gt; no it would discourage people from trying to earn more for doing literally nothing. money should be earned, not appreciated because you lived in a house for a certain amount of time and wont give it up to the next person who wants a place to live unless they gives you more than they can really afford for it.

Literally nothing? If we take my mum's antique's hobby then she's spent decades learning the skills to value and find items of interest. She spends time going to auctions and trawling antiques shops. This is all time spent, unless you believe that people's time is valueless then surely she earned whatever returns she makes on her hobby?

If you apply that to houses there is the time spent looking for and buying one, the extra costs associated (other than just house price) which pay people's wages and put money in the economy. But once you have one you have to maintain it. They deteriorate, they need work done to them. Windows need to be replaced, tiles come down, painting has to be done. That's not ""literally nothing"", that's work you have to do yourself or pay someone else to do. The materials and labour that you spend money on is money that goes into the economy. And when the property is sold a stamp duty is paid to the government. If a house increases in value by 10% so will the money the government receives.

The idea that people should have to give up something they own just because someone else wants it is just not something I could agree with and it sounds like we're moving towards the property is theft idea.

&gt; I love this argument, because 90% of the time the money they are paying tax on has been achieved by exploiting other people in the country in some way, if you take Â£100k as a wage for a company that doesnt have a direct benefit to society, you give Â£40k back in tax, the economy in general is still Â£60k worse off unless you decide to spend that all up quickly

That's a pretty strange argument. I'd really need you to explain how exactly 90% of people paying higher taxes have exploited other people in the country in some way. Again the idea that someone earning Â£100k makes the country Â£60k worse off makes no sense to me at all. The state didn't pay their wages. 

For instance I make a good wage paid for by a company that makes money from people ""wasting their money on luxuries they don't need"", from that good wage I pay a fairly large amount of tax. If those people didn't want to spend their money on these things you think they don't need (or weren't allowed as it seems you want) then I wouldn't have my job, therefore I wouldn't be paying a decent sum of tax to the government. How exactly am I not contributing enough and how have I exploited the country?

&gt; now dont get me wrong if people earn more they deserve more, I just think theres a level where anyone is getting more than they deserve no matter what job they're doing

Well where do you draw the line? What is the level that people shouldn't earn more than? 

Don't get me wrong, I also think people get paid too much. In my opinion footballers aren't worth 50k a week. But if that's what the market is willing to pay then that's life. I just choose not to fund their life styles by not buying over priced football tickets and subscribing to sky sports.

The excitement comes from the fact that the Moyesiah left last year and honestly we owe him everything. He changed us from relegation battlers to what a lot of Evertonians feel are now 'the best of the rest'. With Davey at the helm we knew where we'd finish (5th-8th) and how we'd play. 

While it seems like it can be ungrateful I think towards the back end of last year a decent amount of Evertonians felt like we were stuck in a rut. We knew that without a drastic change in terms of money or style of play we can't climb into 4th. We'd beat most teams at home but against the top 4 and Liverpool we'd play for a draw from the get go and it honestly became frustrating as we could beat them at home. The only time in memory where we tried to win away was at Man Utd in the 4-4 draw and we came so close to a win.

This is where Bobby Martin comes in. Great style of play (which isn't that much of a drastic change despite what some people think about Moyes' tactics), more attacking flair and more tactical flexibility mean excitement. The fact he turned down the job at Liverpool a couple years ago is also a bonus. Unfortunately his defensive record is shit at Wigan. Like proper shit. Whether that's because of him or the players he had is still undecided but is terrifying to us. We've done a complete 180 from Moyes.

We all know it will be a transitional year for us, we just don't know where we're going for the first time in 11 years. It could be the start of another great dynasty or we could go back to the dark ages of relegation battlers. We just know its gonna be fun.",0,1376132031,null,0,false,0,cbkulkl,t3_1k2zk6,t1_cbkulkl,t3_1k2zk6,null,1429879253,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5

That's true. But there's no way he'd get more experience playing for the U21s when he has undoubtedly got the ability and potential to be playing in the PL, perfectly suited for a club like Fulham/West Brom etc.

Plus there's the fact that he can actually be loaned out (twice IIRC) and still count as club trained. 

&gt;  He's now outgrown the U21s for sure so he'd have to be loaned again. 

I personally believe that's happened already. He should be getting more experience at a higher level - he's shown he's ready to move up from the U21s last season in the Europa League and for his national Dutch side. He has got a staggering amount of potential and I can't help but feel it's being slightly hindered by staying another full season for the U21s.

please tell me what collecting overpriced junk does to help anyone?

&gt;That people shouldn't be able to have interests that other people can't afford.

yes, I do think people should not be able to do things other people cant afford despite other people working just as hard. that very concept makes me want to vomit. as for ""intellectual wasteground"" that's how I see the current system, where you are able to work is based upon education and not actual talent or being able to do the damn job. just because some people had affluent parents who could afford to send their kids to a decent school that teaches how to pass exams they get the higher paid work, thousands of brilliant minds are going to waste because nobody will give them half a chance. 

&gt;Literally nothing?

ok not literally, nothing of any use to anyone. a selfish effort that to my mind is undeserving of reward because it drives up prices and makes it that much harder for new buyers. yes I'll admit in many cases I do subscribe to the property is theft Idea. I mean two people work just as hard, and regardless of whether its a good person one person deserves better stuff than the other. I dont see that as fair.

&gt;That's a pretty strange argument. I'd really need you to explain how exactly 90% of people paying higher taxes have exploited other people in the country in some way.

they contribute to a system where they get out more than they put in, someone working just as hard in a lower position get's lost. not fair IMO, the very act of earning the money deprives other people of the chance to earn it. and theres a lot of industries that I don't see adding any real benefit to anyone, and just exploit a need people have by holding back necessary rescources for more money than they deserve for it.

&gt;Well where do you draw the line?

the line can be drawn when people arent stuck working around 50 hours a week and still being on the breadline with no chance to save a penny for their own future. 

&gt;if that's what the market is willing to pay then that's life
and that's the problem here, the market is the key driver of inequality in this day and age. I dont think it's good enough to say ""that's life"" when there are so many people in this country struggling to make ends meet, and so many more people around the world struggling to get enough to eat.

now I'll admit here ive argued more extreme arguments than the viewed just because I enjoy a debate and I do kind of agree with a lot of what you are saying. it's just very difficult not to get lost in the minutiae of exactly what's fair and what's not and I'd say thats how such a bad system like capitalism seemingly works best in practice because it is simplicity of ""grab what you can by any means you can"" 

I'm going to read your reply to this and leave it at that because I could literally argue all day and all night about these issues. You have given me a lot to consider so thanks for not just saying ""lol you're wrong idiot"" and have a nice day.

Everybody knows about the managerial situation, Moyes having left after more than a decade to take the Man Utd job. I'm not entirely sure Martinez is the right man (the defensive record of his Wigan side is pretty concerning), but out of those realistically available he was my first choice. He's got a tough job to follow Moyes after everything he did for us, but as I said, I'm cautiously optimistic that he'll do well. We should see more attractive football at the very least. Judging on Martinez's past, a 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 seems likely, with an emphasis on building attacks by passing it out from the back. Where we finish is going to depend to a large extent on how quickly the team can adapt to the new style, and whether or not we can retain the defensive solidity Moyes instilled while playing under Martinez. 

The other big aspect is obviously the squad. There have been a lot of rumours about Fellaini and Baines, but so far they're still here and don't seem to be trying to force transfers, which is a good sign. But I'll be much happier when the transfer window closes and they're still here. I hink we could afford to lose Fellaini, although it'd be disappointing; Baines on the other hand is indispensable. Mirallas and Pienaar seem like players who should fit very nicely into the front 3, plus the new signings of KonÃ© and (on-loan) Deulofeu. Jelavic has scored a few in pre-season, so hopefully once the season starts we'll see something closer to his first 6 months than last season. Anichebe seems to be perhaps the first choice for the central role, though, judging by pre-season line-ups. I'm a big fan of Anichebe's build-up/hold-up play, but he needs to be more reliable in front of goal. 

There are two other signings, Alcaraz (from Wigan) and Robles (who was on loan at Wigan last year). I find it a bit concerning when a new manager comes along and straight away brings players from his old club, but I think they're all justifiable deals. KonÃ© and Robles both address issues where we were lacking depth and look to be decent players based on their performances last year. I'm less certain about Alcaraz, given his injury record, but I'm happy to give the benefit of the doubt for now. There's also John Stones, not technically a new signing (he joined us in January), but he's been playing regularly (and apparently very well) in our friendlies so far; it seems likely he'll be much more involved than he was last season.",0,1376134240,null,0,false,0,cbkuut0,t3_1k2zk6,t1_cbkuut0,t3_1k2zk6,null,1429879133,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5

Again, what you are describing *is* an investment.

I wouldn't say aspiring home-owners are greedy, simply that they are making the most prudent financial decision. The problem is that the housing you are accumulating and passing down to your children, is land being taken away from other people's children. Say you have a house, and have two children. Both of them become home owners as well, and then you die and they receive your first house. Will they sell that house off for cash, or will they let it out to others?

You could argue that this is what has happened to the middle-class in recent years: those who have been able to get and stay on the housing market have become quite secure and graduated to the upper classes.

true,thejayarr,crest2,Paul Rideout's Glorious Forehead,"Current situation:

Things are pretty good. New manager, new era, and while there's bound to be a transitional period, I think most Evertonians have taken to Roberto Martinez quite well. There's still some lingering concerns about the possible defensive problems that might come from most of our backroom staff being replaced by ex-Wigan coaches, but our defence is experienced enough that it shouldn't be too big of a deal.

Players:

* Leighton Baines. Everybody loves Leighton Baines. [He's bloody brilliant](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/07/02/article-0-1A9FCDCF000005DC-550_634x507.jpg).
* Marouane Fellaini. Possibly not as important to the team as outsiders might suspect, even if he was our top scorer last season. Still, he's somewhat talismanic (just *look* at the guy), but the side could survive without him. Infinitely more replaceable than Baines. He'd be a rubbish signing for Man Utd, though.
* Kevin Mirallas. Showed a lot last season when he was fit, even when forced by Moyes to play against his natural game and do a lot of defensive leg work. Exactly the kind of player that could really flourish under Martinez.
* Ross Barkley. Long been heralded as the new great white hope for Everton, he's not really had that much of a chance up to now due to Moyes' utter distrust of young players (and a serious leg break when he was 16). Expect him to get more of a look in this year, and hopefully he'll look like the player we all want him to be.
* Nikica Jelavic. Great in his first season, famously shite in his second. He probably won't have to do so much running around after defenders under Martinez, so we're all hopeful that he'll find his form again. 
* Arouna Kone. Exists. Hasn't done anything of note in our friendlies. Nobody's quite sure that he's worth the Â£5m we spent on him.


Formation:

Anybody's guess, really. After years of David Moyes' occasionally dour pragmatism, we've used a few different adaptable systems this pre-season, which the players seem to have taken to quite well.

Things to know:

* Founded in 1878 under the name St. Domingo's FC (which certain Everton hipsters still use as an affectionate nickname). The original club in Liverpool.
* A club of real history, but everybody knows things have been tough since the heydays of the 1980s - our last trophies came in 1995. We owe David Moyes a lot for turning the club around after the disaster that was Walter Smith (and the less said about Howard Kendall's third and final reign as manager, the better), but it was clear to all that Davey took us as far as he could.
* Interesting, but possibly untrue fact - Martinez is only our 16th full-time manager since the end of World War 2.
* Everybody hates that stupid badge. We've been promised a say in what the next one will look like.
* Goodison Park is brilliant. [Just look at it.](http://www.grandoldteam.com/background/Everton3.jpg) Who cares it it's falling to bits and doesn't make us any money.",0,1376134411,null,0,1376134597,0,cbkuvit,t3_1k2zk6,t1_cbkuvit,t3_1k2zk6,null,1429879124,4,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,4

Counties or islands have no precedent to appeal for independence. The idea of a nation being in total control of it's affairs and having a written constitution for the rights of it's people isn't an unusual one. Any movement that takes place in, for example Aberdeen or the islands, to be annexed, will most likely get as much traction as the movements for independence do in Cornwall and Texas. That's not to say however that in an independent Scotland local areas won't be granted greater control over their affairs, perhaps with mayors or governors, such as in America.

I think we'll change formations a lot this year between a 4-5-1/4-3-3 and a 3-5-2/5-3-2 depending on the opposition. Alcaraz is injured (shocker) and Heitinga could leave so starting with 3 CB's is out of the question for the opener unless this Alderweireld rumour is true.

Barkley will get more playing time this year under Martinez as for all of his positives Moyes hated youth over experience (see the inept Neville starting CM over Barkley on numerous occasions).

Saying that Deulofeu won't play as much as people expect barring injuries to starters as Pienaar and Mirallas are just better and I can't see Kone starting from the beginning of the season as he's looked terrible in pre season.

Whether Fellaini is still here is a question as most of us are pretty sure Baines won't leave as that would be suicide for a new manager at Goodison as Baines is our God.

Not many of us are that bothered if Fellaini leaves as long as we get decent money as he's replaceable and can't pass for shit so he may struggle under Martinez's possession style.

A successful season for the club would be to finish top half and have a decent run in a cup as we do love a good cup run at Goodison.

true,Apwnalypse,null,null,"&gt; Actually, most people will never be able to afford more than one home, so it's only a practical investment in that it won't leave them at the mercy of a landlord later in life when they're on a fixed retirement income... it's not really sensible to sell a house you live in.

I would argue that the solution there is better right for tenants, and better enforcement of those rights, which is something most of us would agree we need anyway. After that, is does become a purely financial matter. If you're saving for your retirement, it *should* be a better idea to put that money into a pension, or care scheme, shouldn't it?

As for the tax burden falling predominantly on the middle classes and pensioners, I would remind you of the often quoted statistics that the [richest 10% of households control 40% of the wealth](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/03/richest-10-uk-households-40-per-cent-wealth-ons). Since this tax is levied proportionately, using those figures 40% of revenue would come from the super wealthy (in a form, unlike income tax, that is impossible to dodge). That's not even counting the huge tracts of land owned by supermarkets and landbanks, which are another large chunk of the land.

There's a load of grants being handed out by Broadband UK (BDUK, which is part funded by the government and the BBC licence fee!) to upgrade areas to fibre.  However the whole thing has been badly managed, it was first delayed by an EU subsidy investigation and than by a bad system.  With the result the only people getting grants and still looking for new areas is BT.

Than you have this ridiculous thing where BT and Virgin roll out fast broadband where the other one has first. So if Virgin decides to upgrade your local speeds first, BT wont be too far behind.  So you either have 2 providers of fast broadband or none.

On Infinity all the other providers are moaning that the difference between the price they get charged by BT Wholesale and the price that BT Retail charges are so similar that they can't compete.  Which is why there's hardly any FTTC providers.  Sky does do 40 meg but the last time I checked they didn't do 80 meg.  And some of the prices quoted by other providers are just insane e.g. Â£250 per month and a 500GB limit.

true,captainlavender,smith,Smith,"I have no problem with anecdotal examples, unless they are specifically of rare things happening, which this is not. But I would say the politics of this situation are not so straightforward. I would draw the comparison to the n-word. On the surface analysis, people (white people) see the facts that black people are allowed to use the word to each other, yet when a white person says it, it's rude. And from that they take the idea that black people there have a right they do not. But it's only seems that way because of what it represents -- when a black person says the word, it contains none of the connotations of a white person deciding it is appropriate to say. We have so much buried racism in our society that, usually, the n-word is the leak before the dam bursts. A person who say the n-word may really be threatening -- or they may just be threatening because they see no problem using dehumanizing slurs, and that is hard to deal with with a straight face. Like how a friend who can call you fatso, but not a stranger. 

In the same way, telling a man to stop drooling over some chick isn't really very mean. Few men would be hurt by it. many would shrug it off without a second thought. So why can't you say the same to women? Because drooling over guys is something women are only just now learning how to do. It's only in very recent years that the stigma of women expressing attraction for a man is being lessened. We're like overenthuiastic freshman who binge drink and go nuts at all the parties, jsut because we can, and we almost can't believe we're allowed to say stuff like that. I never watched Sex in the City, but IMO it changed the kinds of things women are allowed to say. I grew up learning that a lady doesn't talk about sexy men in a mixed group -- even among other women I have difficulty expressing whether I find a man attractive. And I didn't grow up in the south. I'm talking east coast liberals, here. This is what girls grow up learning. ""He's so dreamy"" is okay. ""Love that ass"" is rude. ""I want him to kiss me"" is okay. ""I'd like to fuck him"" is not.

And yes, as I mentioned, this movie (several of Hugh Jackman's movies, actually) are among the minority of films that have more male nudity than female nudity in an attempt to market male sex appeal. But it's still the vast, vast minority (think about the stir magic Mike made when it came out.... how many countless movies about women stripping have there been over the years, and nobody bats an eye?).

&gt;Video games and comic books come in for endless criticism whenever male fans get a bit of fanservice

This is straight up disingenuous. The level of female nudity in anime and video games, unless you avoid most subgenres, is literally inescapable. And I've tried. I could go further into how objectification makes women excluded and makes them less likely to speak or share their thoughts ([it has been proven](http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2010/01/12/how-sexual-objectification-silences-women-the-male-glance/)) or how unbearably depressing it is to try to just play a fun game and get barraged with tits and asses, or how it's all especially insulting since nearly every single video game protagonist is male (feministing has her famous/infamous video series tropes vs. women in which she points out that making women hostages or damsels in distress has arguably *increased* in recent years), or how it feels to live in a culture where your sex -- your sex specifically -- has been [defined by their beauty](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/07/26/why-your-brain-sees-men-as-people-and-women-as-body-parts/) and their husbands (or wives, in the theoretical case) for hundreds of years, or how women are still evaluated based on their bodies no matter if they're Angelina or Madame Curie (how many times have you heard people talk about how ugly Eleanor Roosevelt was? How many times have you heard anyone notice how ugly Winston Churchill was?), or how it feels when you play a video game or read a comic book and characters of your gender are all dressed like [this](http://fernacular.tumblr.com/post/17814450235/welcome-to-if-male-superhero-costumes-were) while the characters of the other gender get to dress like [this](http://www.themarysue.com/fully-clothed-superhero/#0).

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; but a very large amount of people don't like the kind of hostile foreign cultures we have been nurturing in this nation. 

Very large amount? Apart from a minority of Muslims (which people always mean when they are talking about 'hostile foreign cultures'), name me a culture within this country that is hostile towards the UK. There is not a very large amount of these people, because if there was, there would be a lot more violence. 

&gt;If you dislike the anti immigrant right wing ideals, as I'm assuming you do, you'd do well to begin proposing alternatives to dealing with the problems these people are causing, because the reactions that some people have are understandable.

I don't know what you would suggest as an alternative. What is British culture? We have been invaded by the Romans in the 1st century AD, the Viking in the 7th and 8th century, the Normans on the 11th century, and then our empire was partially built upon the work of foreign cultures in British India and Africa, and less so on slaves and then their descendants in the West Indies and Caribbean. There is no 'British culture', and when most people talk about it, they just mean 'white', 'Christian', and 'has a British accent'. 

So, what are we supposed to do? Send everyone who isn't white and Christian to a foreign country (I'd say home, but what is home when they and their parents were born in the UK)? Make everyone who isn't stop doing things their culture has previously done, like Chinese New Year, or Diwali? I don't think there is anything we can do apart from a mass deportation of anyone who's culture we don't like, which sounds very totalitarian. 

I agree with what Maajid Nawaz, a member of the think tank Quilliam says. A lot of British youth are frustrated. With a lot of non-Muslim youths, we see this push them towards gangs and anti-social behaviour (lots of drinking and stuff). However, because there is a militant section of Islam within the world, with a small minority in the UK, we see some British Muslims pushed towards extremism. It isn't a problem just with Muslims, or the Muslim culture, it is a wider problem within Britain, but the media like to paint it as just a Muslim problem, and so do many politicians.

&gt;Preaching from your moral high horse will not change the way the average man in the street feels about these kind of things

I think the question you have to ask is 'why does the average man think this way'? Personally, I think it has a lot to do with certain parts of the media, as well as politicians, making the issue seem bigger than it is. The papers do this partially to sell papers (controversy sells), and partially because of their own political believes (more so with largely political papers like the Daily Mail, less so with papers like The Sun). For the same reason that people think there is more crime now than in the past, when the media push an issue in a biased and non-impartial way, people will perceive the issue as being a bigger problem that it actually is.

Now, politicians keep up this rhetoric because it gives them votes. They can exaggerate a problem, then 'solve' this problem they have basically made up in order to get more popularity and votes. This is exactly the same as what Cameron is doing with the Internet Filters. You would expect politicians to take the moral high ground and not pander to exaggerations and lies, but as we've seen, the bottom line is that politicians care about votes, and will say and do anything to get them (a good example of this is within Labour, where every main Labour politician has essentially said Brown was acting like a tyrant before the election, so it is not their fault that anything wrong happened). 

This is a problem that the politicians have basically made for themselves, and now they have to face the consequences of a society which is more divided. The issue is, however, that they don't care, as long as they get votes it doesn't matter.

I did not say that women are not objectified in the media, only that their objectification comes in for a level of widespread criticism that is not matched by the minuscule level of criticism objectification of men comes in for. 

There was no fuss about Magic Mike, not really. There's not going to be any fuss about Wolverine, there certainly wasn't in his last movie where he's naked for a good ten minutes of the film. Not compared to the decade of fuss Tomb Raider has generated. When Lara Croft got a redesign for her last game people were still pulling out the tape measure and still angry about the size of her breasts. 

If you think that's not true, come to r/startrek and join in the weekly (often more frequent) thread on Alice Eve and her underwear, a scene Damon Lindelof has *apologised* for. Two seconds of underwear becomes the most discussed aspect of the film. 

As I've repeatedly tried to make clear, I do not want to shame anyone for having a sex drive. That goes for men and women. That's not my point here. If you want to fuck Hugh Jackman I don't blame you because he's a fucking good looking guy. My only point is that to suggest that objectification of women does not come in for criticism is utterly false.

Teresa May thought that looked too much like hard work and gave up pretty quickly. She tried to force it though the courts to which the ECHR and 3/5 of the British courts including the immigration commission denied her request for fear of torture. It's worth pointing out that it was not only the ECHR they were breaching here. The UN convention against torture would also have made the UK complicit in torture has Qatada been tortured in Jordan.

Eventually May admitted defeat and asked Jordan in stronger terms not to use torture evidence or to torture him. They agreed and the ECHR and the British courts were happy to let him go. The whole time May blamed the ECHR (conveniently leaving out the part where a majority of British courts also ruled against her) and now we, British citizens, face losing our rights because Teresa May and David Cameron are still trying to keep up the facade that it wasn't their fault it dragged on so long.

We're one of only two debt free teams in the league (the other being Swansea).

In the last 4 seasons we've rocketed, promotions from League 1 and the Championship, and finished 12th then 11th in the BPL. Despite being tipped by many ""experts"" as being the team most likely to go down.

Last year our youth beat Chelsea to win the FA Youth Cup in what most would consider an upset, considering how much some of the ""big"" teams spend on youngsters. 

The FA Youth Cup was an amazing experience, for how many of our supporters got behind the youth squad. Carrow Road attendance was 21,595 which was more than Stamford Bridge, despite them having more supporters and a larger stadium.

This season, the general mood is of excitement. We have a lot of new players. The club has been able to spend without living beyond its means thanks to strict financial control from the board and the new TV money from the league. Whilst trying not to daydream too much, I think many of us are secretly hoping to crack the top 10.

The actress has said she'd come back if they asked her to, and I think it would be a shame if they didn't sieze the opportunity to have a live link between the anniversary special and the first episode.

I'm hopeful, because the last season had three references to her, which is more than they normally do. She was mentioned in the Rings of Akhaten, we heard an echo of her voice in Journey to the Centre of the Tardis, and we saw a glimpse of her during the opening to The Name of the Doctor.

There's also the docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time, which could help to introduce new fans to the original characters and the people who played them. Plus: 

[50th Anniversary Spoiler/Rumour](#s ""There will be scenes in locations from the first episode. They've done that before for other anniversaries and not included her, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed. At the very least, I hope the Doctor will be reminded of her and talk about her a bit. Maybe the scenes will be set in 1963, and they'll get the young actress from the docudrama to play the younger version. The Doctor might have to avoid messing up his own timeline."")

One reason I'd like to see it happen is because some parts of the fanbase have been hostile to the romantic arcs. I think they might be more open to the show exploring a familial relationship. It would be way to show off other sides of the Doctor's character without upsetting the squeamish.

Peter Capaldi could just about pass for a grandfather, and the young actress from the docudrama could play the granddaughter if they wanted her young. Or maybe they'll have her regenerate so she can put her own spin on the role.

I saw the leaked trailer for the docudrama and the young actress has just about perfected the mannerisms and laugh. There was a bit at the beginning where you hear dialogue from the first episode, and it took me a second to realise that it was the new cast doing the same lines.

Everyone has skeletons in the closet. Once you start kicking up a fuss then suddenly nobody except Antarctica is good enough to host an Olympics.

So you either have you ask yourselves whether you want to scrap international sport altogether and go back to the days of cold war back and forth boycotts. I bet most Britons would be ""outraged"" if countries boycotted the London olympics, or even discussed it, because of all the various crimes Britain has committed (and not 200 years ago, like right now).

""Weird-looking aliens and broad humor"" sounds like he would enjoy the Slitheen episodes. The thing is, there are very few episodes of the seasons 1-4, in which nobody dies. So if that's generally upsetting for your son, it could be problematic. 

Since Moffat has taken over however, the show has become a little more kid-friendly in general, at least with regards to violence, cruelty and death (although there still is some really hard-hitting stuff to be found). 

Some suggestions, if deaths are allowed: 

- Aliens of London/World War Three
- The Christmas Invasion
- Army of Ghosts/Doomsday
- Planet of the Dead (that one has pretty creepy human-size flies, they're friendly though)

Recommendations without deaths (although I don't remember them all in detail, so I'm not absolutely certain):

- Smith and Jones
- Partners in Crime
- The Doctor's Daughter

Stuff from the Moffat era (which I suspect, he will enjoy more. I do too by the way.)

- The Eleventh Hour
- Vincent and the Doctor (just wonderful, invisible monster + van Gogh, so it's also a lesson in art history)
- The Lodger (very funny with a few creepy bits in between)
- The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang
- A Christmas Carol 
- Closing Time (very funny as well)
- Dinosaurs on a Spaceship (Hell yeah!)
- The Power of Three

I don't have kids, so I find it generally a bit difficult to recommend this stuff. I think this list is somewhat suitable for a little kid, but be careful.

I honestly could not disagree more. Ba is pretty much useless at hold up play, he can't dribble, and he falls over far too much when put under pressure. Torres can provide crosses/through balls, he is a better passer than Lukaku or Ba. Lukaku is good at hold up play/flick ons, which is something Ba is also bad at for some reason. Ba is a pure finisher. He's a good finisher, but it's like we're playing with 10 men the rest of the time. My toon-supporting mate agrees, he was the same when he was there. He much prefers Cisse because Cisse gets involved in the build up whereas Ba does fuck all

He hasn't been tested as a lone striker - most times at West Brom he had a strike partner. And even when he was used as a lone striker, he was usually used as an outlet  to run in behind defenses rather than a target man (holding up play and bringing others in). And this next point has been brought up quite a few times - Lukaku had lots of space to run into while at West Brom because teams didn't defend deep against them. However, at Chelsea, most teams defend deep so our forwards aren't afforded much space to operate in.

I'd love for Lukaku to hit the ground running and instantly find success in the team. If he doesn't, at least we have a couple other decent options to fill in until Lukaku is ready.",0,1376147389,null,0,false,0,cbkx7t9,t3_1k2t98,t1_cbkx7t9,t1_cbktnp2,null,1429878031,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

I'm referring to what Dalglish and Carra have said.  Carra goes into his perceptions of what it means in depth in his autobiography.  He uses a quote from Sir John Smith, a former LFC chairman, to embody it:

""We're a very, very modest club at Liverpool.  We don't talk.  We don't boast. But we're very professional.""

Further, Carra goes on to describe it by saying it is keeping disturbances in house and that Liverpool has always ""handled a crisis with dignity.""

I agree with you that it is tough to pin down exactly what it means, and that it is indeed used erroneously to describe everything the club does, but there are a lot of influential Liverpool FC figures who have defined what they think it means.

I think the style of play bit is very general, but it refers to pass and move, for me.  So, a continental style instead of the typical English method of bashing it forward.   Perhaps it's more helpful to think of ""The Liverpool Way"" as a philosophy that Liverpool does things a certain way that is not predicated on what others do but instead on the club's own traditions.",0,1376149918,null,0,1376150921,0,cbkxwkq,t3_1k3b1g,t1_cbkxwkq,t1_cbkxqt2,null,1429877710,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Just as you might include the cost of a railcard into the train price.

Many people will have a car anyway even if they mainly use public transport, because even the best public transport won't be as flexible as a private car (needing to go to a hospital or vet at night, or visit a relative in a very rural location, for example).

I bring all this up because it seems that there can't be much more regrettable than the spoiler above and yet Hurt's Doctor seems to be the biggest secret he has.

true,TehWhiteSamurai,present,Mata&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,"For me its a couple things. 
1 we already have 3 quality strikers at the moment. Yes Torres is struggling, but id rather support him and hopefully watch him succeed than to see Rooney come in and take away his chance. We signed him for a reason so work on it instead of spending even more money. 

2 I personally hate it when a bpl player switches to another bpl team. Yes I am well aware that as a club we do that a lot (ie: Torres from liverpool, Ba from Newcastle) and that's one of the problems I have with our current ownership. When RVP moved to Man U I lost a lot of respect for him. Yes the move worked for him and he won the league but I personally like to see loyalty now a days instead of it being about money. That's what makes Giggs, Lampard, Terry, Gerrard, and others so special. 

So id rather see Rooney challenge RVP over there and earn his spot instead of coming to us and stealing the show from some of our players that are fighting for a spot already. But thats just me...

Seriously, if you think the composer determines the *direction* of the music, you're dead wrong.  The composer does what he's told, and the person doing the telling in the case of Who is the showrunner.

The reason why people find it easier to draw the line in the sand over LGBT issues is because they affect people we know. The whole point of the LGBT/Stonewall movement, up until this point, has been the idea that if we're 'out and proud' people who otherwise would be apathetic will know gay people and when anti-gay legislation or other oppressive aparatus is put forward they'll stop and be able to put a friend or family member's face to it and begin to care.

People are terrible like that, but that's the way it goes. Pressure groups kicked up a fuss when China held the Olympics (anyone remember the photograph at that protest where someone had written 'Would we have let Hitler host the Olympic games' unironically?).

There isn't a boycott and I'm not aware of anyone seriously suggesting it (Mr Fry suggested moving it, which isn't the same thing).

I live in Cornwall most of the time. I have a car because the buses are useless/expensive and to take the train anywhere requires me to use a very inflexible train service (the village has a station, the first train of the day towards the mainline is 11am) or bus/drive to the nearby town that is on the mainline. A lot of the time I end up driving to the town and getting on there.

I have also lived in Reading. I didn't own a car at the time - the bus system was really very good and I lived close enough to be able to walk to the town centre at any time of day. I saw no need to own one when public transport was acceptable. Train services were pretty good too.

Going to the hospital or the vets isn't really a justification for owning a car, unless you have very deep pockets it's a one-in-a-million time that you might need one and in which case the cost of a couple of taxis is far less than owning a car, just in case.

None of this changes the fact that it is not fair to compare the cost of petrol with the entire cost of getting the train. It might be the preferred way to do it so that the train seems a lot more expensive but that doesn't make it correct.

The cable companies that built the networks that are part of Virgin, only did it where they think it would be profitable. It's not unreasonable to suggest that BT are only following them because it's profitable for them too.

I can actually agree with BT getting it - you only have to look at the likes of Digital Region in Yorkshire, which isn't making money and the choice of ISPs is really limited.

At least if BT rolls it out, there's the guarantee that you're not stuck with a few ISPs.

&gt; Sky does do 40 meg but the last time I checked they didn't do 80 meg. And some of the prices quoted by other providers are just insane e.g. Â£250 per month and a 500GB limit.

I have 80Mbit from an ISP that isn't BT. We pay something like 40 quid a month, but it is a reputable ISP. 300GB between 8am and 8pm and unmetered evenings/weekends.

2. the you of the next generation will have to work even harder than you and earn a damnsight more money to enjoy a pension that is half what you have

I get that you think you have earned all this money and deserve it but frankly living that far beyond your needs is actively making life more and more difficult for the next generation.

Yes, I do agree that moving the Olympics or boycotting them is the wrong way to go. But that doesn't mean it is wrong for a man concerned about gay rights to call for it. When there is an opportunity to shine a light on human right violations it is never wrong to do so. Things like Fry's open letter bring these issues into the public eye, it gives people an opportunity to see and learn about human rights violations around the world that they may have been blind to before. As a straight male I never really found myself looking into how Russia's stance on homosexuals has been affecting them and I am grateful to Stephen Fry for bringing my attention to it. I am also hopeful that some of our athletes will make small public gestures of their own, not just to show their solidarity but to help more people look into the effects that these homophobic laws and attitudes are having.

As for those who say ""sport is separate from politics"", they will never cease to make me facepalm. The Olympics, and sport, does have political goals and influences. Just a look at olympic.org and you can see them exacting there influence in environmental issues, equality, promoting peace, development and using sport as the bases for all these areas. Read the Olympic charter and try and tell me politics is seperate http://www.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf . You can even see major political moves both through and from sport that have contributed to progress. From Mandela wearing the green and gold to support the SA rugby team to the black power stance taken in the 1968 Olympics have gone down in history as both great sporting and political moments.

The Olympics has a big power in bringing citizens of countries together when they otherwise would not even think about each other (even if it is just through a TV). Sport is not an overall solution and it will not provide a magic fix but it does have great political influence in the minds of all those who watch. A man or woman who hates isn't going to be swayed from hate but those who aren't aware can be made so. Politics can no more be separated from education, banks and shops, roads and transport or minimum wage and taxes than it can be from sport.

In other words: No there is not going to be a boycott or a change in location , not it is not silly for someone with an interest in gay rights to call for one when it is not going to happen or not for the best for it to happen. No, politics is not separate from anything, even sport, but there are bigger downsides to burning bridges than building them.

P.S. Sorry for the long ramble, just getting annoyed at the many posts I see whenever this topic is raised that try and say that ""politics is separate from sport"" or that ""Fry should keep his nose out"".

Superficial indeed. I don't think a player's appearance should really come into question.

Additionally, I don't really think the Ba comparison is fair because Rooney is a significantly better player than him - this is backed up by the huge amount of goals and assists he's put in at his time at United.

The fundamental reason for signing him is who scores goals. He's good at it. Very good at it. I personally can't see why you wouldn't want him in the squad - if anything, it would add to Lukaku's development, learning from one of the best strikers in the world. The only major downside is his initial cost and wages. Anything over 35m and I'd prefer to see a younger striker come in.

Try picking on somebody for the colour of their skin in a school and there's going to be trouble.

Do the same because someone's ginger and the school couldn't care less.

Sorry for the whole ""check your privilege"" thing but if you weren't ginger at that age, you couldn't possibly understand what the fuss is about.  I felt isolated throughout my whole school life, which left me very socially awkward for years after.  I got terrible grades, despite knowing the subjects well because I just didn't want to do anything for a bunch of teachers who were complicit in my bullying on nearly every occasion.

Sad people cry, then generally feel better about it. Sadness also tends to come in waves. Depressed people tend to cry less and don't get relief from their low mood and this tends to go on for a bloody long time with little or no fluctuation in mood.

Then 4 years working in the Middle East and a further 16 years working in Europe and South East Asia - all the time saving every last cent I could, living with my wifes folks and covering all the bills ... once I'd saved enough I bought land and then BUILT my own house, again to save on contractor costs.

My house was worth 20% more than what I expended the second it was finished. Unfortunately it's been standing empty for two years because we haven't yet saved the money for all the furniture and interiors.

Because after all that shit, if I dare to capitalize on my OWN success and hardwork by buying a second place to rent out and make some bang, I'm the greedy one ? Seriously, fuck you.

true,kyhadley,null,null,"&gt;That's true. But there's no way he'd get more experience playing for the U21s when he has undoubtedly got the ability and potential to be playing in the PL, perfectly suited for a club like Fulham/West Brom etc.

The U21s are actually set to play quite a few games this season in multiple competitions, 31 IIRC.  I think that plus a handful of Cup games is a good amount of experience.  Also I think being able to train and develop a player yourself is an advantage over loaning.

He has the potential for the Premier League, but I'm not so sure that he does have that ability yet.  To be honest I bet the crux of this decision was that there weren't any PL offers for him so they decided it was best to keep him instead of loan him below the PL or outside of England.

&gt;Plus there's the fact that he can actually be loaned out (twice IIRC) and still count as club trained. 

This was the point I was trying to counter most in my previous comment.  It's true that he can still be loaned twice and qualify as club-trained.  But by doing so you run the risk of either having him miss out on being club-trained or spend a year with us as a 20-year old and not play as much.  While right now it is still arguable whether he has outgrown the U21s, it definitely won't be next season (regardless of if he was loaned or not).  

So it makes sense to keep him now while he can still progress with the U21s (gaining his club-trained status) than loan him out now, have him return and then feel like we definitely can't keep him for the next one or two seasons (that was what ""rinse, repeat"" was referring to).

So option 1: have him play with the U21s despite the possibility he could play at a higher level, qualify as club-trained, loan him out freely (Europe becomes an easier option as well in this scenario) the next one or two seasons  
option 2: loan him now, keep/loan the next season (will he be ready to stay then?), keep/loan the season after (will we keep him and have harm is development even worse than we may be doing now so that he qualifies or loan him and lose the club-trained status?)

I think you may be underestimating the value of having him become club-trained and he's already so close to it that I think it makes a lot of sense to have him qualify ASAP.

&gt;It has worked in the past, is working right now and will continue into the future - for example: Courtois/KDB.

Yeah I'm not arguing against loaning out players.  Those two never could have qualified as club/nation-trained so it was an obviously easier decision.",0,1376154679,null,0,false,0,cbkzba2,t3_1k1p90,t1_cbkzba2,t1_cbkuome,null,1429876982,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,Kesuke,null,null,"The trouble is the violence is perpetrated by entire communities - so going and arresting half the men aged 20-35 from a single impoversihed estate in Northern Ireland like the aftermath of the 2011 London Riots just stokes tensions even more... because if those men are from the loyalist protestant community their fellow protestants will accuse police of being lax on catholic nationalists commiting similar offences... or vice versa if they arrest catholic nationalists then the police get accused of heavy handed supression and intimidation of the catholics.

It strikes me that the problem stems from the fact that social violence has just become so fundamentally ingrained in the culture of certain communities in Northern Ireland that it will be very difficult to change. These parades/protests aren't just an isolated event like the 2011 London Riots... its a sort of bizarre social-cultural event in Northern Ireland, sort of like a big extended family wedding or a wake. Whole communities party and drink all day, then towards the evening the younger ones go off and exchange glass bottles and kicks with the police. It's a sort of social institution and right of passage.

Thankfully, at least the decomissioning of weapons after the Good Friday Agreement (coupled with the fact it is now harder for paramilitaries to aquire weapons in a post-september 11 world) has meant the violence has not translated into a significant loss of life like it did in the 1980s.",0,1376154760,null,0,false,0,cbkzc90,t3_1k2xe4,t1_cbkzc90,t1_cbkuol4,null,1429876969,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

&gt; an appreciating asset you did no actual work to apppreciate

You seem to be missing the 30 years I HAVE WORKED to gain the money to buy that asset. It didn't fall off a fucking Magic Money Tree, or get given to me at the inaugural meeting of the ""Fuck the Next Generation Club"", it WAS FUCKING EARNED ALREADY.

I don't know why this is such a hard concept for you to understand. 23 is your age, and not your IQ I presume ? Work hard, save money, buy things with money, and occasionally sell them for more money. You know, they way the world has worked since money was invented.

Do you seriously camp outside the supermarket, and accuse them of being greedy for putting a markup on the food they sell ? Do you blockade your bank because they have the gall to pay people interest on their money ? How exactly do you think economics works ? Do you understand the concept of wealth generation ?

Or do you think we should all live in identical grey boxes, with identical grey furniture, celebrating the fact the no one strives, no one attempts to better themselves, for fear some poor cunt might get upset or depressed because he doesn't have the same shit ?

&gt; and demanding to get more money than you put in out of your house

And here is where the logic really goes to fuck. If I DON'T sell my house, I continue to live in it. It doesn't increase the pool of houses, it doesn't magically become available for anyone ELSE to live in. Because it belongs to me, you dumb fuckwit, not some kibbutz-style shared ownership concept you seem to think actually exists.

The problem is that there is not enough new cheap housing being built. This is a fact. The problem is NOT that people buy something, and then expect it to increase in value. Why would anyone buy something, knowing it's going to be worth LESS ? You might have money to piss away, the rest of us want to see our assets increase in value. Not much, not to become overnight billionaires ... just enough to be sure the 30 years of hard work we put in already doesn't amount to being worth fuck all when we can no longer work, and there's no Social Security money left to pay us a pension.

But it's perfectly arguable that he'd be getting this at a lower ranked PL club or a higher ranked Championship side - all of greater significance than U21 level.

&gt; not so sure that he does have that ability yet.

Seriously? He's been fantastic when he's played for us and his numerous outings last year in the Europa League and PL substantiate this. He looked calm on the ball and played as a valuable part of the team. He certainly has the ability in my books.

&gt; spend a year with us as a 20-year old and not play as much.

I see what your saying but I respectfully disagree. By loaning him out he's always developing - with every single match. It's true that he might not come back straight into the side, but that's completely fine. He gets loaned out again. There isn't a problem doing this because then we really do see if he's a first team player or not. We don't harm his development at all because he's consistently playing at the right challenge and level for himself.

Perhaps I'm underestimating the value of having him club-trained. That might be right. But it's true that he's getting club trained being loaned away to another side so I don't particularly see the problem here. He should be playing at the level he's capable of and right now I believe he's way above U21 standard and should be gaining experience at a higher level - still allowing him to gain the club trained status which is likely to become more of an issue in a few years time.",0,1376155566,null,0,false,0,cbkzlgl,t3_1k1p90,t1_cbkzlgl,t1_cbkzba2,null,1429876849,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

&gt; On Monday the government slipped out the news that private insurer Bupa was approved to access England's ""sensitive or identifiable"" patient data, housed centrally by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). It is now among four private firms that have passed the government's vetting procedures.

&gt; The charging structure for ""bespoke patient-level extracts"" was revealed when HSCIC put up a ""cost calculator"" to work out how much prospective customers would pay for sensitive hospital data. **The ""indicative fee"" for a full set of 20 years' inpatient data was about Â£8,000 including Â£140 to make the records identifiable.**

These are the two likeliest pairings I see, and that is assuming we run the 4-2-2-2. It was certainly interesting how they switched to the 4-2-3-1 after Eddie went out.

true,kyhadley,null,null,"I don't disagree at all that he would develop more with not the U21s, but I don't think it would be that significant at this stage of his career.  Also don't forget to count in any senior appearances he might (likely will) make, those are of greater significance than any loan ones would be.

He may be there, but I would still like to see a few more outings which he should get this season.  It could be that other Premier League clubs also want to see a few more solid outings so maybe some senior apps can boost his chances of a PL loan next season.

&gt;It's true that he might not come back straight into the side, but that's completely fine. He gets loaned out again. 

But this is what I think poses the problem.  If we loan him out now we run a *tremendous* risk of him not playing 1 season with Chelsea before he turns 21 (that's what he needs to become club-trained, if he goes to another club it doesn't count so ""it's true that he's getting club trained being loaned away to another side so I don't particularly see the problem here"" isn't quite accurate) and I think that would be very poor management as he only needs that one more season.

So if we loaned him now we would have to be going through this whole argument again next season, and then potentially again the season after.  See what I'm saying?

If we keep him now, then the next two (or less) seasons we can loan him *anywhere* in Europe to a club that fits him perfectly without any reservations.  Just like De Bruyne and Courtois.

I get that he is probably too good for the U21s but I think that will be offset by senior appearances, and I get a loan spell may be ideal for his development but I don't think a season with the U21s will really hold him back much (he is still 18).

Who they are, where they are, what they like/dislike, when they go to work, when they're more likely to be home, what their phone numbers are, your e-mail addresses (even the private one only your family know about) and a full medical history. 

It means a company could in fact know every dirty little secret you wouldn't necessarily want them to know and they'll then act on it.  Just because you like wearing a corset and petticoats when the wife's away doesn't mean you want a Vollers catalogue randomly coming through the door.

A cold winter night. Having left a friend's house, I was walking home. A pig drives past in his blues and twos, spots me and swerves over onto the pavement. He winds down his window and the pig shouts at me: ""Oy you! what's your name?""

Not a good way to start a conversation. After telling the pig that I didn't wish to speak with someone so rude, pigman threatened to arrest me.

However, what you've said makes perfect sense and is quite probably what the club likely intends to do. To be honest, it's a signficantly better option than what I've suggested but I've always held the firm belief that players develop much quicker at a younger age so it's crucial to get the experience in then, rather than at a later stage so I guess that's why we probably don't share the same opinion.

Anyway, you've changed my opinion so I guess I should congratulate you for that... Nathan Ake is my favourite prospect so I'm really looking forward to seeing what comes of him.

true,wish0r,lfc12,,"On the match today:

I am a bit disappointed with the end result. Performance wise we were heads and shoulders above Celtic's B team but we couldn't score any goals. I am, however, also a bit glad that we lost this last preseason game so people (especially the players) realise that we still have a long long way to go. 

For me, Enrique and Downing are nowhere near first team quality. LB for me is a position that needs improving as soon as possible. The other position we need to strengthen is the right forward one where Downing is currently playing. I always thought that Aspas could play there but Rodgers decided to sub him off for Sturridge, for whatever reason, so I guess he won't be part of the front 3.
Also it shows that we still lack quality players if we need to play a front three of Henderson - Sturridge - Ibe (as at the end of the match). 

The last thing I want to add concerning the match: we seem to be playing a slightly different midfield formation as compared to last season where Gerrard and Lucas were both ahead of our defense. Now only Lucas holds that position and Gerrard and Allen are ahead of him. I think this formation does not work quite as well with our current squad. Gerrard simply is not good enough anymore to play there. A better solution would be Allen and Coutinho ahead of Lucas. Playing Coutinho on the left wing is a traversty in itself in my opinion which you can see really well, especially when you rewatch the match today after Henderson came on and took Coutinho's place with him moving to the middle.

To sum up: we are a long way off Top 4 and while I really love FSG and Henry, I dislike him stating that the League Cup, FA Cup and Top 4 finish are our goals because that is simply not possible. If we want to finish in the Top 4, we need to give Rodgers more money. Remember that Costa bid of 21m that Atletico rejected? If we really want the player, offer 30m.

No of course we're not. There's no guarantee on these things. However, the chances are that we will improve with a very good striker. And that's a very good chance.

The thing is with your second sentence - that could be applied to any footballer in the world. Nothing is certain and nothing is guaranteed. Chances are, with a great player like Rooney (although *personally* dislikeable to certain people which becomes entirely irrelevant when he starts scoring), we will only improve as a team and we will have a much better shot at winning the league.

Logically, there would be no reason for the high council to grant so many regenerations if they could keep other time lords on a tighter leash. It would make more sense if they had one at a time, and had to beg or barter for extras. 

Obviously that would prevent them from going rogue for too long, which would interfere with the entire concept of the show. But if they didn't do that, it would take a lot of silly rationalising and fudging to not make the time lords look ineffectual.

If there was a biological limit then it would make them more interesting characters, especially if extensions had a terrible price (taking the regenerations of another). Whether we're talking willing sacrifice or violent theft, it has the greater potential for drama without requiring illogical and unbelievable acts on the part of the time lords.

I really don't see the writers ignoring the limit. It's such an interesting concept that it's managed to lodge itself in the public's perception of the show, regardless of contradictions.

The classic show contradicted itself several times, but the consensus hasn't changed. A few years ago, RTD wrote in the guardian newspaper that they were scrapping the limit, but the consensus hasn't changed. In the Sarah Jane Adventures, the Doctor himself said he had hundreds of regenerations, but the consensus hasn't changed.

All of their attempts to dislodge the idea from the public's consciousness have failed, because nobody cares what's easy for the writers. People like the concept, which is why the question has been asked for decades now. When RTD took the revived show to the US, one of the first questions he was asked by an American journalist was what would happen when the Doctor runs out of lives.

It wasn't until the secession of the plebs (arguably the worlds first general strike) that they had any power at all. Also wealth in that part of Roman history was harder to come by.

By the time just before the empire both classes were incredibly rich, plebs had a long standing veto on the senate via the tribune and one of the consuls had to be a pleb. Also plebs and patricians could marry, something that was illegal when the republic was formed.

Henderson is a more complete player, you're right, but we don't necessarily need ""complete"" players so long as everyone fills their role.  Sturridge and Lucas and Aspas aren't really ""complete"" players, but we need them and we need to start them because they fill important roles.

Hendo is being given some competition for a starting place, not being ousted from the squad.  It's good for both him and Allen, and they're both professional as hell about it- they know the deal.

It is detrimental to the squad that we play *Hendo* on the wing.  I don't mind Coutinho on the wing, personally.  Of course he's better in the center, but he has the trickery to do well on the wing and the intelligence and skills to come inside when he can.  Hendo is not great on the wing, and isn't quite smart enough to move into the middle of the field and back out to the wing very smoothly.  It's just not in his DNA- he's a CM.

My 2 cents.  I think Hendo is a very good player and will be an anchor with the squad for seasons to come.  But I think Allen has the potential to become much better.

Coutinho and Enrique on the left side did not work today. Coutinho drops back and cuts to the center so much, and Enrique was just awful, which meant we had no attack on the left side. 

I said it in the match thread, but I have no idea what Downing was doing. Seemed like he was playing RM and letting Johnson simultaneously be RW and RB. That was just weird. Downing did provide the pass that Coutinho should have finished.

Our finishing has been poor lately. Sturridge was about the only one who didn't shoot it right at the keeper today. Had a lot of shots hit the post last game too.

For the positives, Mignolet did well. I feel good with him in net, certainly better than with Jones. Toure seems to be the stand out signing, but he is a very experienced defender playing against lower quality teams. Have to see how he does against PL teams. Coutinho, obviously. Lucas has been incredible, really need him to stay injury free. And I thought Sturridge did well for just coming back from injury. Ibe also did really well when he came on.

Given that Sturridge played on the wings once or maybe twice last season, he's not going there either.

That leaves two players to start on the RW and then provide cover for either wing, as I imagine Coutinho will be spending more of his time out there than in the centre, if pre-season is anything to go by.

Imagine the following scenario: I am the owner of a block of flats (and for the purposes of this model, none of my tenants can enter or leave, and have to live here). Imagine however, if instead of charging my tenants rent, I simply take a % of their income and tenants simply buy flats from one another. Very quickly, the wealthier tenants would begin buying up the flats of poorer residents, and rent them back to them. Population also increases in this time, increasing demand. Very quickly, rents will skyrocket, making the flat-owners incredibly wealthy, and the poorer residents will become ever more impoverished. Eventually, I the landlord, would be forced to begin handing out cash to the poorer residents just to help them pay the rent and stop the whole system collapsing into anarchy. I achieve this by increasing income taxes, lowering everyone's productivity.

And that is exactly what has happened in the UK, and how housing benefit has come about. You'd never run a block of flats like this, so why do we run the country this way? The problem in this scenario was not that I started giving cash to people to keep them in their homes, but that I didn't charge rent in the first place.",0,1376160434,null,0,false,0,cbl14q9,t3_1k0y7p,t1_cbl14q9,t1_cbkvogo,null,1429876134,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,wish0r,lfc12,,"I am a bit disappointed with the end result. Performance wise we were heads and shoulders above Celtic's B team but we couldn't score any goals. I am, however, also a bit glad that we lost this last preseason game so people (especially the players) realise that we still have a long long way to go.

For me, Enrique and Downing are nowhere near first team quality. LB for me is a position that needs improving as soon as possible. The other position we need to strengthen is the right forward one where Downing is currently playing. I always thought that Aspas could play there but Rodgers decided to sub him off for Sturridge, for whatever reason, so I guess he won't be part of the front 3. Also it shows that we still lack quality players if we need to play a front three of Henderson - Sturridge - Ibe (as at the end of the match).

The last thing I want to add concerning the match: we seem to be playing a slightly different midfield formation as compared to last season where Gerrard and Lucas were both ahead of our defense. Now only Lucas holds that position and Gerrard and Allen are ahead of him. I think this formation does not work quite as well with our current squad. Gerrard simply is not good enough anymore to play there. A better solution would be Allen and Coutinho ahead of Lucas. Playing Coutinho on the left wing is a traversty in itself in my opinion which you can see really well, especially when you rewatch the match today after Henderson came on and took Coutinho's place with him moving to the middle.

To sum up: we are a long way off Top 4 and while I really love FSG and Henry, I dislike him stating that the League Cup, FA Cup and Top 4 finish are our goals because that is simply not possible. If we want to finish in the Top 4, we need to give Rodgers more money. Remember that Costa bid of 21m that Atletico rejected? If we really want the player, offer 30m. Otherwise we are in for another Top6-7 season. ",0,1376161306,null,0,false,0,cbl1ede,t3_1k3mic,t1_cbl1ede,t3_1k3mic,null,1429876008,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

1. Trident would be removed. When and how is not what you would be voting for, as those decisions are something that both the Scottish and rUK governments would need to agree to (they can't just be rolled over the border).

2. The vast majority of it, yes. The UK's maritime border is divided into areas covered by Scottish Law and areas covered by English Law. The Scottish portion is the shaded area in [this image](http://cdn.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/6937858-1.jpg). Most of the oil fields (red) fall within the Scottish sector, most of the gas fields (green) fall within the English sector.

3. The NHS in Scotland is a separate organisation from the NHS in England; things like free prescriptions in Scotland arise simple because the NHS here has decided to spend money differently than in England. We would have to live within our means, but it seems plausible to think that most of the things that have happened in Scotland since devolution would continue.

Actually resolving those, in the sense of finalising them, is not something that could be done before a referendum - aside from NHS Scotland, the other two would require negotiation between the Scottish and rUK governments.

true,timhm,eng-kent,Kent,"I agree, it is a very sweeping statement. I still believe that many people would still keep a car in the face of very good public transport, simply because it's usually significantly more convenient. Although as your example shows, it depends on what journeys they expect to make, your personal situation (families will be more likely to keep cars than single people, as the cost of a car journey per person goes down with more people), and how much of a financial burden running a car would be to you (students for example may well forgo this).

You're right, it's not completely fair to compare just the cost of petrol with the cost of a train ticket, but I believe it's a reasonably close one, without having to figure out how to factor in one off costs (which go down for each journey) like MoTs and train subsidies.

**Contracted hours scenario:**

I work 20 hours per week part time and I hold a contract. The contract defines minimum hours and when I work. I cannot be given less hours, my work is guaranteed and even though it doesn't pay all the bills, it does pay most of them. 

Because I can rely on that money and know exactly when I am working I can arrange other work around these hours. While the situation is less than optimal it is manageable with a second job.

If my employer asks if I can work outside of these hours and the timing conflicts with the necessary second job, I can say no because my hours are guaranteed. As such my job is safe and I can still pay the rent.

**Zero Hours scenario:**

I work 20 hours per week part time on a zero hours contract. This contract has no minimum hours and does not define when I work. Even though it doesn't pay all the bills, it does pay most of them but my hours can be reduced or changed at any time for any reason, non-compliance guarantees less hours.

Because I cannot rely on that money and know exactly when I am working it is difficult to arrange other work around my hours. The situation is far from optimal but I still have to manage with a second job.

If my employer asks if I can work different hours and the timing conflicts with a necessary second job, I cannot say no because I am contractually obliged to comply, I can try to explain the situation but my inability to work whenever asked may mean my hours will be reduced to the point where I can no longer afford to continue. 

Or... I have to give up my second job to ensure I keep the first, even though my new/extra hours cannot cover the shortfall. As such my job is *not safe* and I can no longer pay the rent, bills and council tax without benefits.

I understand about playing time because even though they won the league he didn't play nearly as much as he wanted to. If that is the main case then I understand a move to another club, and youre right it does show courage to move when you know some fans wont like it. im not saying I don't respect RVP, I understand why he moved to Man U and obviously it paid off and I still respect him and rooney, they are both amazing players. I just lose respect when they do it for money, I never claimed that RVP did it for money, what I was trying to say is I lost respect for him because he was treated like a god at Arsenal, and instead of helping a club that did so much for him try to get a trophy, he left for his own desires. there is nothing wrong with perusing your own goals that's not what im saying, what im saying is that it felt like it was a stab in the back to the club. Like I said, I like to see loyalty now a days. ie: Garreth Bale, yes he moved from south Hampton but he is making a name for himself at Spurs and instead of going to Madrid for one of the biggest deals ever (where they would probably be favorites for CL, and yes I realize he wouldn't play that much) he is staying at spurs who has yet to be in elite European competition with him. so if its about playing time I completely understand, that was probably a deciding factor for bale as well, but does he have a better chance of getting hardware here than there?...tough question",0,1376166228,null,0,false,0,cbl2up2,t3_1k3c78,t1_cbl2up2,t1_cbkyeq8,null,1429875330,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,Quis_Custodiet,null,null,"So let me explain how the system at the hospital where I work operates, and why that's valuable in terms of patient care outweighing (in my mind) the potential loss of anonymity.

Every current inpatient is listed on the system by their location in the hospital. Anyone with access to the system can theoretically see the diagnosis, observations, prescriptions, lab results, personal info etc. of any inpatient. The system is essentially a database of all current inpatients, requiring a username and password login on an individual basis. 

So yeah, I understand that from a privacy standpoint that sounds scary, but hear me out.

What it means is that anyone in the hospital can access their data, and that's a *good thing*.

What it means is that if a specialist is in theatre, or on another ward, then than can instantly review the history of a patient in decline. Specialist nurses, the resus outreach team, specialist doctors, a ward about to accept or discharge a patient elsewhere in the hospital, prescribing pharmacists and consultant psychologists have easy and immediate access to information which enables them to make the best choices in terms of patient outcome.

It also means that there is a double record of everything that happens - paper and electronic to reinforce the guarantee of continuity of care.

Here's the kicker though, the thing which makes me support it. This system is audited *constantly.* If access is deemed inappropriate, then the staff member in question has a case to answer. Nurses and doctors have been dismissed from the trust and one referred to the NMC for inappropriate access to records of people they knew or VIP patients. There is a trail, it is enforced, and there are safeguards in place. What's more, this is the norm in patient data. 

Frankly, I'd be astounded if there was anything more than either isolated examples of total data for specific patients, or anonymised data on a large scale, except for where those companies provide direct care, and it is agents of the company who have transient and discrete access to the data.

He's completely right about the House of Lords, the entire chamber has been made a mockery of by political appointments. It isn't anything against Laurence herself, just that I don't think peerages should be handed out to commoners like this. Since the Parliament Act the House of Lords has become nothing more than a rubber stamp and that frustrates me quite a bit, I could go on forever about the importance of two independent chambers but I'll leave it at that.

He's right about immigration too, being born in the UK may make you British on paper but it doesn't make you British at heart. Being British is about culture and if you grow up in a multicultural area in which you are mostly segregated from British culture it is hard for you to fully identify as British or for other people to accept you as British. Go to Germany and see the Turkish communities, or to France and see the Algerian communities, you can't tell me those people are as German or French as the ethnic Germans or French.

He's probably wrong about his views on the Second World War, it's not like isolationism would be a defence forever, but these ""what if"" scenarios get ridiculous after a while. It gets to a point where there's no point in arguing what could have happened and just get on with what did happen.

The British policy towards Rhodesia was one of the most shameful episodes in recent British history. The Rhodesian people who were in many cases ethnically British (although most were actually black African), who were very pro-British and who sacrificed a lot during both world wars were completely betrayed by socialist idealism. Ian Smith warned of what would happen if the ZANU were allowed to win power. Sometimes you have to accept a compromise in the interests of a nation and in Rhodesia that would have been to keep white minority rule for at least 20 more years. But again, what happened happened and there's no point arguing over that now. Lets just hope Mugabe isn't around for much longer.

Now because I'm straight and don't have AIDS this wouldn't have been a problem either way. But if I had been, and the company could do some reverse engineering on my medical records, I could have been in trouble.

Fast forward to the 1990s when I tried to get critical illness insurance and was turned down due to a previous condition. Now move to Holland, where insurers aren't allowed to ask about previous conditions. But if they *can* get access to your health records...

Chadli was fairly quiet IMO. He drifted in a lot from the left and remained central almost the whole game.

Soldado on the score sheet was great. He stepped up to take the penalty straight away grabbing the ball which was really good to see.

Sandro and Kaboul both back from injury today which was great. Both were quiet other than a few attempted headers from Kaboul from corners.

Walker and Lennon linked up nicely with some great passing football.

Controversial one, but I'd consider dropping Gerrard for Allen.

you earned the money the house was worth when you bought it, you sure as hell didnt earn the apreciated value

how do I think economics works? it doesnt. this inequality is evidence of that. I understand the basic consept of wealth generation, it goes something like:con everyone else out of their money for a ""service"" they dont need or want. moving money around so that you get more and everyone else gets less is not wealth generation

I dont care about ""doesnt have the same shit"", it just makes me sick that some people are living a life of decadent luxury they dont need while others who work just as hard if not harder cant make ends meet. that's not remotely fair so I dont know how it can be justified

so continue to live in your one house, just don't act like you have some moral highground when you buy another you don't need and demand more money than you paid for it, and if you do move out and sell up I dont think you should be able to get more than you paid for it. i know it belongs to you, but why do you deserve your life more than other people working just as hard. you dont. so stop acting like you are in the right because your actions are fucking my generations shit up as we speak and you have no justification as to why you deserve it more than another.

Im not saying it should be worth less muppet, im saying it should be worth what you paid for it plus inflation, any more gain on that is just greed pure and simple

we wouldnt need new cheap housing built if the previous cheap housing didnt become more expensive despite being the same houses.

true,RomanAbramovich,RU,russia,"We bought Marin before we won the Champions League at the end of 11-12 season for Â£7m. At Â£7m he was a cheap player (for us) who was known to have potential but was quite an injury risk. We then went on to win the CL which granted us Â£Â£Â£ and a good name. That summer we signed Oscar (an attacking midfielder) for ~Â£20m and Hazard (a winger/attacking midfielder) for ~Â£32m. They were both big money signings, and one could question if we could have signed them had we not won the CL.

The problem was that they play similar positions to Marin, which meant that realistically he didn't have a place in the team. Couple that with his injures throughout the season and you find that Marin never had a chance to shine.

So what do we do? We could:

A) Keep Marin as backup this season

B) Loan him out to let him get playing time at another club and re-assess his ability at the end of the season (either sell or keep)

C) Sell him now and probably make a loss but at least get him off the books

We went with B. The truth is, he isn't *currently* as good as the rest as our midfield options, so he never stood a chance as a starter, but maybe with the chance to start at another club he could shine and develop into a better player, either to play for us next season, or sell for a profit/breakeven.

Did I cover what you wanted to know?

(Edit: missed an l in midfielder)

All they ever said was ""the next Doctor"". 

This obviously refers to the persona and not the character. As such, it's entirely possible for Hurt to be the next incarnation and that Smith's successor will therefore be ""the next Doctor"". 

Not only does this fit with the Valeyard thingy (who therefore breaks the promise of being the Doctor), it will still accomplish something similar as to what people thought was going on: Moffat trying to rush towards the regeneration limit so he can solve it.

Additionally, 10, 11 and Hurt are spoken of as to be a trinity. Now, I don't really see how 8.5 or earlier incarnations would fit in the picture of a trinity. 10, 11 and (not) 12 on the other hand?

Another reason is if there is some primal urge that we dislike being watched? Maybe it makes us feel hunted or pursued, but as stated, these recordings aren't being viewed most of the time.

true,Kinjuru,cnty-england,England,"The point of Zero hour is to dynamically adjust your workforce to meet demand as it expands and contracts. Only employing the most people at the busiest times means a company can save a lot of money during the quiet times, charge less for its product and be extremely competitive. 

There doesn't seem to be much wrong with this on the surface, it sounds great and you would be right, it is great for banks and some shareholders, just not so much for everyone else.

You see the problem is that other companies in order to be competitive also need to adopt these zero hour contracts in order to compete and survive. Employing more people perhaps but at vastly reduced hours. Now you have a situation where you have a considerable number of people with considerably less spending power. As a result, other industries start to feel the squeeze.

The answer of course is easy, Zero hours contracts everywhere. So now we have *even more* people earning less, spending less and paying less in taxes.

Profits start to suffer and businesses start to falter especially in industries that have no direct bearing in peoples immediate survival. 

The point is that while Zero hour contracts lead to short term gains the mid to long term prognosis is not a favourable one. All they do  is defer our problems rather than deal with them.

The point is, society is not perfect but we should be trying to make things better for ourselves not worse. Increasing the ways in which we exploit the next guy will not lead to anything good, not for you, not for me and especially not for our children.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As for a non-white doctor I don't think it is a good idea, the thing is I don't care about the colour at all, but it just wouldn't be the same. Moreover, whenever I encounter this kind of controversial subject on equality (wether it is on racism or gender equality, etc), I reverse the situation in my head. Try imagining the same situation, but with a black doctor for example. 11 black doctors for 50 years and suddenly a white doctor. Now that would be weird. Furthermore, this situation reminds me of the french government (I'm french it's the first example that came to my mind), who gives better subventions to political parties who have 50% male 50% female, for so called ""equality"". No. That is that is not how equality works. You don't employ someone because of their gender, and you don't cast people because they are non-white! The only thing you should be looking for is talent.
To finish with, a woman doctor would be a disaster. The character of the Doctor, though very flexible, must keep certain characteristics with each regenerations. So far those have been, male white Doctor with a unique outfit, and sometimes a catchphrase (I have only watched season 1 and the beginning of season 2 of the classic series, so I can't speak for all of them, please forgive my ignorance in the matter), now we all agree a regeneration is always a big deal, I mean we lose this marvellous (once again, can't speak for all of them) Doctor, and this stranger thinks he can just walk in and BE the Doctor ? So much change, as much as we understand the concept, it is important for the Doctor to remain the same character in our minds to keep a few landmarks. Change these few basic characteristics and the Doctor will stop being a character and start becoming a concept. Now, I may be new in this fandom, but I can't beleive for one second this is what the whovians want the show to become. Finally, I can also give a technical reason for why a different gender is a bad idea. As we all know, Doctor Who is famous in many different countries, the title ""the Doctor"" has consequently been translated in many languages, if not for the dubbed version, at least for subtitles. As you may know your ""the"" which concerns both genders in English, can turn into, 2, or even 3 different words with other languages. Therefore, a change of gender would make ""le Docteur"" very weird because ""le"" isn't usually used to designate females in French, and would actually turn ""der Doktor"" into ""die Doktorin"" in German, which means that in several languages the name of the Doctor would change along with his (her?) gender. I am not personally concerned with this problem because I watch the show in English but I can see how that could become a problem for a lot of people.

And who are we preaching to? If most Russians don't know about the LGBT issues in their country, they're living under a rock. Yet the majority of Russians aren't speaking out against it, and LGBT rallies are attacked continually, with LGBT people being kidnapped and tortured by ordinary, non-government affiliated Russians all the time, and the results posted online with no real outcry from the Russian public.

O2 apparently do not have roaming charges between north and south, based on:

If a relatively significant country like the UK took a stance and boycotted the Olympics, it would certainly make major news headlines and tarnish Russia's reputation further, along with said-headlines raising awareness throughout the world. People who would be looking forward to the Olympics would be annoyed at the disruption and further entertainment events might avoid Russia in future for fear of a similar disruption occurring.

If there's an overwhelming public interest in having a right of way over private land, for instance to create pathways between towns and villages, or alongside major rivers or the coastline, local authorities should have the power to step in, and create them.
