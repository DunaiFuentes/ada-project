true,DerkhaDerkha,null,null,"&gt;there has got to be an element of ""we're ripping you off because we can"" in it all

Insurance is a form of gambling. Insurers calculate a price and hope that they 'win'. A quick Google shows[ they lost £2bn in 2010](http://www.insurancedaily.co.uk/2011/06/18/motor-insurance-underwriting-losses-exceed-2bn/). They lost 20p for every £1 paid in premium.

Notice how keen they are to sell breakdown/accidental death or other add-ons? Yup, they're pretty much all profit and keep these companies afloat.

We have a very competitive market in the UK. There are plenty of companies who don't want young drivers and give stupidly high quotes. There are plenty of others who are happy to gamble and take on young drivers. They're all trying to undercut each other whilst still making a profit (an actuary/gambler earns a nice salary ... [£40-£55k for a newly qualified one](http://www.prospects.ac.uk/actuary_salary.htm))

My point is this - insurance companies aren't making money out of young people ... if anything, the older people won't miss £50 here or there. No, insurance companies hate young drivers because a small percentage fuck it up for everyone else.

The government is somewhat restricted by what they can do. They can't stop young drivers driving 2 litre turbos without a lawsuit from certain manufacturers. They can restrict times (penalises night workers) and passenger numbers (penalises young families) ... otherwise they just have to let premiums skyrocket.

Uncertainty about the future is not a good enough reason for keeping a nuclear deterrent.

Even ""crazy"" leaders like Ahmadinejad and Kim Jong-un are not insane, they know the consequences that the use of nuclear weapons would bring. We are adequately protected from nuclear threats already, our own deterrent is simply a nostalgic throwback to a past where we were once powerful and important.

I think the real reason that our politicians (or at least the mainstream ones, god knows what UKIP think...) are unwilling to give up Trident is that they fear we will lose our seat on the UN Security Council. And even if that is a possibility, that should not be our priority. At any rate, the Security Council badly needs reforming - the 5 permanent members are based on the great powers from the end of WWII.

And how exactly would that happen without a second strike capability? You expect some other country to open its self up for attack to protect an already destroyed and now politically and economically useless United Kingdom? 

Not going to happen. 

Honestly, I don't foresee anything like that happening either but I realise that just because **I** can't foresee things happening doesn't mean they won't. 

Pakistan and India are a couple of nuclear powers who are still quite hostile towards each other. 

Iran is seemingly interested in getting a nuclear weapon with Israel hating on that idea pretty hard.

Then there's China and Japans little disputes including a rise of nationalism in China which is never a good sign. 

Then there's NK just recently detonating nuclear bombs and seemingly trying to scare SK. Okay, they don't have anything approaching a deliverable nuclear weapon right now, but what about in 20 years time?

There's lots of stuff that can go wrong. We've had 65 odd years of peace but to just assume that will last is dangerous. 

Also, it's worth noting that there's a very strong argument to be made that the reason for that 65 odd years of peace is because we developed nuclear weapons.

The adult-themed mannerisms were only added in the quiz to amuse the guests who were kids during Blobby's prime but who are now adults themselves. This of course went over Jack's head.

Note that this probably was pretty much Mr Blobby's going-away performance: They got out the old wrinkled costume one more time, and it probably wouldn't last another time after that, so unless they make a new one, that's probably gonna be it.

The usual line given when things are privatised is that a private for-profit company will run a more efficient service, and so offer a better value for money. 

This contract is worth £1.6 billion, so I assume this is significantly less than the current cost. 

Another 'benefit' of privatisation is that new kit can be bought. In this case, new Sikorsky S-92s and AgustaWestland 189s helicopters will be brought into service. The current SeaKings apparently need 30 minutes of servicing for every hour of flight time, which seems terribly inefficient. 

The main argument against privatisation is that a for-profit company worries about their profit margin, whereas a state run service is more concerned about the quality of service. 

The profit margin may lead to corners being cut leading to a lower standard of service. In this case that may mean the safety of casualties and crew. 

I live in Snowdonia and this time of year the mountains are full of idiots who need rescuing. The local mountain rescue teams are volunteers, and they work closely with the RAF at Valley in getting people swiftly off the mountain and to hospital. I'm worried that the relationship between the two will not be as strong and the service will suffer. Hopefully I'll be proved wrong but that remains to be seen.

To remain in power, the Conservatives are going to have to increase their number of MPs, because the Liberal Democrats will lose a few seats to Labour and/or the SNP. No government has managed this for decades upon decades.

Further, the Conservative Party has not won an election for over 20 years. It's already lost its appeal to voters, demonstrated by its failure to win in 2010 when it faced a hugely unpopular and tired government. It's not going to magically regain this appeal in an era when it's failed on the economy, failed on the NHS, failed on education, failed on defence, failed on the environment, failed on business and failed on welfare reform.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Also, from my experience with private school kids, they are imbued with more confidence by the system they go through

This is more important than any other factor. 

Oxbridge do not massively discriminate against public / private schoolers because they're elitist. Public / private schoolers simply tend to do better at interview because comprehensive schools don't facilitate the building of interview skills.

The vast majority of public school kids are articulate and confident. That's because (beyond knowing that htey're at a top institution), they're talked to by adults, in 1 on 1 settings, from a very early age. They're treated like adults. 

This means in a 2 on 1 interview at oxbridge, they're better able to express themselves and 'pushback' (which for most oxbridge interviews it he key factor they want to see you do). 

I went to a grammar school and the thing that helped me most for interviews wasn't interview coaching (which they didn't do anyway) but rather the small extended history and politics sessions where students debated in small groups against teachers. That confidence in being able to talk to adults was, as you note, a key factor in my interview I feel. 

To its credit, oxbridge is trying to remedy this by creating various initiatives that let state schoolers get that confidence building experience.  Unfortunately so long as most schools see interview skills as something that only 1 or 2 candidates in their school need, it won't develop.

In short, state schools that don't have a track record of good academics and oxbridge admissions get given a huge amount of leeway in terms of grade. Oxbridge wants more state schoolers. They're not willing to compromise on student quality and may occasionally err on the side of caution (though not always, read the article), but they're more than willing to give state school students a boost to overcome deficiencies in the schools they went to. 


Edit:

In particular this quote:

&gt;The phrase ""a good school"" comes up repeatedly in the tutors' discussions. It is used most frequently about private and grammar schools, but also some comprehensive schools, and has a double meaning. ""A good school"" is a high-performing one. It is a school that knows what Cambridge requires, where the school reference is delivered in the terms the university is looking for – the key phrases are ones that emphasise superlative performance compared with their age group: ""He [or she] is best in … he is top of …"" But when a candidate comes from ""a good school"" they are also cut less slack. Of one applicant from ""a good school"", a bemused tutor says: ""The thing that didn't sit with me is, his [predicted] A* is in further maths, but he couldn't do his arithmetic.""",0,1364339140,null,0,1364339396,0,c9307q2,t3_1b1j2v,t1_c9307q2,t1_c92yypz,null,1431713214,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"Spot on, Sir.  I do wish that successive governments would stop fucking about with these Departments.

Back in 2005, The Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise were working just fine.  Gordon Brown decided to merge them into HM Revenue and Customs, with the loss of thousands of jobs and enormous cuts to their budget.  The result?  A catastrophic Government department whose failures are legion, with tales of ridiculous waiting times on the phone and, most recently, the announced closure of all enquiry centres.

A year after the merger, it was decided to carve off a segment of HMRC into SOCA (the Serious Organised Crime Agency) together with bits of the National Crime Squad, NCIS, NHTCU and bits of the Immigration Service.

Three years after the merger, it was decided to remove the detection function of HMRC and merge it with the Border and Immigration Agency to form UKBA.  This department too has been woefully underfunded and given stretching targets that it simply cannot meet.

I can't speak to SOCA's performance, but take a look at how badly HMRC and UKBA are doing.  This government (and the last) seem to have a penchant for cutting, merging, rearranging, re-cutting and re-merging these agencies and departments, creating utter fucking havoc at every turn.

The end result is invariably a worse service to the customers, astonishing demoralising of staff, and very little in the way of positives results.  I believe the most appropriate word to describe it is 'Clusterfuck'.",0,1364362664,null,0,false,0,c937tch,t3_1b1j4c,t1_c937tch,t1_c92raza,null,1431716847,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He's been credited with doing the most (along with Rafa) to change the locker room attitude. He's been at the top and he knows what it's like to win and the attitude that's necessary, and I think he's done a lot to instill that in our younger players.

For the most part, he's been fairly solid this season. He was great for us in past seasons too (he also single-handedly saved our CL run with that goal-line clearance against Milan).

However, he's made a few highly visible, highly costly mistakes this season. Do I think he could put in a good shift? Of course. But I wouldn't rely on him for long stretches anymore. Despite all that though, were he to stay, our CB lineup for next season would likely be Vertonghen, Dawson/Kaboul, Caulker, and Gallas. Look at the 4th/5th choice CB's in other clubs. United have probably the best depth in CB, and their 5th choice seems to be Phil Jones, who I don't think is much more solid than Gallas. Man City don't even have a fifth choice CB, their fourth choice would appear to be Touré, who suffers from a lot of the same issues that Gallas does. On to Chelsea, their first four are Luiz, Terry, Cahill, and Ivanovic. Their fifth choice is Nathan Ake, an 18 year old with a whopping one substitute appearance. Arsenal's fourth choice is Squillaci. I don't think I need to comment on that. 

Were he to stay on as a coach or something like that, I'd be okay with it, he has a wealth of experience (sorry) our youngsters could benefit from. But at the moment I think it would benefit us more to have Caulker move ahead of Gallas on the depth chart. 

So tl;dr: We could do worse than having him as our fourth/fifth choice CB. Much worse.",0,1364362783,null,0,false,0,c937ucj,t3_1b30u8,t1_c937ucj,t3_1b30u8,null,1431716859,18,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,18

The list is in alphabetical order (fadas skew that a little but I imagine it's attributed to the letter's unicode number).

The question is worded as is because I realise votes can be determined at a local election by who is running and the quality of candidate rather than which party and so this seemed better than 'Who would you vote for next election?'

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"There are already some excellent answers here, but I just thought I'd weigh in on what Alonso and Vidal's true central midfield roles are.

First off, Xabi is a deep-lying playmaker, not really a CDM.  He used to line up alongside true CDM tacklers and ball-winners in Sissoko, and then more effectively Mascherano.  Alonso's range of passing was/is phenomenal, and he has the ability to accurately start a break or attacking move with one pass of 10 or 40 yards.  That is a great mix for center midfield because you have a player who will win the ball back quickly, or intercept a pass, and then a player they can instantly play the ball to who can kickstart the attack--and in some cases completely link defense to the forwards.  We are seeing a very similar partnership now with Gerrard and Lucas, but we haven't quite seen it on Alonso-Mascherano levels due to Lucas's slight dip in form since his injury and Gerrard still fully settling in to a more reserved role in attack.

Vidal, on the other hand, is a true box-to-box midfielder and has the ability to do it all, really.  He is quick and strong and can tackle well.  He also gets forward and has a knack for goals--his goals per match for Juventus (where he's blossomed into this role) is .25, the same as Gerrard's for Liverpool, for instance, and better than Yaya Toure's, who is considered the proto-typical example of a box-to-box mid.

In short, Lucas is just another type of holding central midfielder, and it isn't really fair to compare him to two other top central mids who play in different roles, but the same positions.",0,1364372605,null,0,false,0,c939g6g,t3_1b23yx,t1_c939g6g,t3_1b23yx,null,1431717698,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3
true,Legionary,eng-yorkshire,Yorks.,"You say they haven't lost their appeal but I'd simply say again: the Conservative Party has not won a general election in the United Kingdom for 20 years. It couldn't even win against a government that was utterly exhausted, which had a leader the public hated and blamed for the recession, in circumstances which should've seen the Tories sweep to a crushing victory.

Instead they failed to gain an overall majority and had to compromise their legislative agenda by entering a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. That's not winning an election. It's losing one -- and it's what the Tories are now adept at.

The Conservatives have a problem because their core voters tend to cluster together in affluent and rural areas in the south of England. That's not a bias in the FPTP system, it's simple population demographics.

The older you get, the harder it will be to go back to full-time education if that's what you really want to do. Why? Because then you get obligations, you start to feel like you can't afford to walk away from earning a steady wage, and employers keep wanting ""Young, energetic graduates"", so you begin to wonder if it's even worth it.

Let me lay this out right now: *It is worth it*. Doors you can't even imagine right now will be arbitrarily closed to you in the future without a degree. Next time there's a recession? CVs without degrees are the first to hit the bin, because it's a fast, lazy way to cut out 9/10ths of the applicants. Struck by the crazy urge in your mid-30's to take a year or two away from it all and go teach English in another country? Most want you to have a degree. You only ever noticed the doors which are closed, never the ones which are open.

Yes, people make it without degrees. Aggressive go-getters don't need no steenking degrees. Good for them! They've got balls of steel, and they ain't gonna let anything get in their way. Their passion and brilliance drives them... And they are a very small minority. Don't compare yourself to them, because these guys make *everyone* feel like an underachiever.

Take the Foundation Degree. It's one year. That's all. A-Levels are two (unless you find a college which offers accelerated A-Levels, but they are few and far between because colleges are a business, and they don't earn as much having you for 34 weeks instead of 68). One year, you'll already be at the university of your choice, and you can start getting the hell on with where you *want* to go.

Speak to the CAB, or to whoever is in control of your debt management plan. Find out what it will take to get that either put on hold, or paid off sooner. Find out whether, if you are already on debt management, whether you can take out a student loan. Look at every possible way you can do this.

A friend of mine went to University straight after school. He essentially screwed about, and turned a three-year degree into a five-year playtime. He finally finished, with *five years' debt* for a three-year degree. He's just turned 34 and only now finished paying that debt off. For the love of fudge, work your tits off if you get to uni - you don't need to be haemorrhaging money like that.

true,ThePolack,null,null,"Honestly, all I've ever heard is bad things about the job centre. The best ways to find jobs (in my experience) are to A) apply directly - either find the advert on a job hunting website and track down the company that's hiring or B) know someone who can pass on your CV or whose name you can mention in your cover letter.
Learn everything there is to learn about the company - their website will generally give you a decent knowledge of what they stand for and the kind of attitude you will need to have to work there. If not, research more - wikipedia, call their customer services and chat to someone. Learn what they are like. Tailor your CV to reflect this.

After you've emailed your CV follow up with another email or phone call if you've not heard back in a day or two. Ask for feedback if they reject you. Take this on board.

If it's not a money issue (and from your post it sounds more like a morale issue) - get bar work, cafe jobs, McDonalds. Swallow your pride. I worked in a bar for a year when I first moved to London. It sucked but it got me out of bed, got me a supervisor job, a customer service award and a shit load of confidence talking to people.

Yes.

&gt; As I am sure you are aware, you are supposed to ""give way to traffic coming from the right"". That is, giving way to me.

Correct, that doesn't mean you can carry on regardless if you see the other idiot ignoring that rule. Unless you actually enjoy filling out insurance forms ?

&gt; I would argue that the other driver is in the wrong, as demonstrated by them having to do a rather sudden application of the brakes and skidding over the white line.

Yes, they are in the wrong - but if you hit them, so are you ! Two wrongs don't make a right, on the road or anywhere else. If you are behind someone approaching a roundabout obviously way too fast, you ease off and put some distance between you, ANTICIPATING (there's that word again), that he'll probably be anchoring up pretty damn soon.

What you DON'T do is stay up his arse right until the last second, and then complain that he slammed his anchors on and you didn't have time to react.

This is what I'm trying to get across .. anticipation is always better than reaction, and once you have more experience you'll understand this.

Find something that you're interested in and find out what you need to do to work in that field. Get to know people in that field, interact with them on forums, twitter, social networks etc. and see what their views are of what you need to do to get a job in that field. You may find after talking to some of them that it's not for you. Fine, you've just dodged a bullet.

Nobody gives a shit about your A Levels by the time you're on your third job or have a few years of work behind you. It's the mindset that counts.

Keep paying off the debt management plan and keep the night warden job in the meantime. It might be soul destroying but you need to keep going and pay that shit off, otherwise you'll be in a far worse position. Stay off the sauce or at least keep it reasonable and you'll do fine.

 With the decline of heavy industry in the North of Britain in the there were a huge number of working class men made redundant. In Aberdeen the demographic is fairly different, those working in oil are much more mobile (both socially and geographically) with Aberdeen acting as a hub for engineering graduates and those who have worked in the oil industry previously in the middle east, Texas etc. 

I'd also wager there are a lot less people employed in the oil industry currently than there ever were in the coal mines for example, so them becoming unemployed would be less devastating to communities.

Also, there's a concerted drive towards renewable energy at places like the Nigg energy park and the Pentland Firth.

I think it's worth mentioning that you've raised a valid point with regards to how the end of North Sea Oil will effect Scotland, but they're surely just as valid with regards a Scotland still part of the UK as an independent Scotland?

You can have what you like delivered to them, if it's large they would appreciate you giving them an email or text to let them know, or if you are not going to be collecting your shit for a while, likewise. 

As to notifications, you can receive a notification via text or email. The notification will say literally ""You have a new package waiting for you at MBE {Location}"" ...{Location} being replaced with whatever branch of MBE your box is at.

The notification will also give you a link to your account on a piece of software called MyDigitalDoorman:

http://www.mydigitaldoorman.com/

It is used by MBE to log each individual package that comes in. You'll be given an account when you sign up, and each package that comes in addressed to you will be logged on the website. Your account will list what type of mailbox you have, what your last packages (delivered and you've taken it) were over the last 30 days and what your current (delivered but they are waiting for you to take it) packages are. The detail for each package won't be too much, but will list what type of package it is (box/letter/parcel/package), if it has any special requirements (needs to be signed for/is being hold in the back room if it's large etc), when it came in, when you took it and who (which store assistant) took the package from the delivery guy in the first place.

They accept any and all parcels, from any courier. If you are getting something delivered from the US or internationally and you are required to pay the courier postage, they will however do one of two things 1) refuse it or 2) pay it for you and require you to pay them when you pick it up.

Agitated crowd turn on Minister

We that sign this letter acknowledge our responsibility for the damage that was done to the bombing school's buildings on September 7th.
Since the intention to build the Llyn Bombing School was announced, we, and several leaders of public life in Wales did everything we could to stop the English government from placing in Llyn an establishment that endangers all culture and traditions in one of the Welshest areas of Wales. But despite all this, despite sending letters and protestations from hundereds of religious and secular societies throughout Wales, despite thousands of Llyn constituents signing a petition begging to stop the villainy. Still the English Government refused to even accept delegation from Wales to discuss the issue. Peaceful and legal methods failed to win for Wales even common courtesy from the English government.
Therefore, to draw attention to this immoral abuse of the Welsh Nation's certain and natural rights, we used this method, the only method left to us by a government that insults the Welsh Nation.
Yours, in the bond of Wales.

Doctor Who is a great show, but it still exists within the realm of todays media. Even though the show has done a great job breaking down some social taboos (though Moffet is decidedly less interested in this than RTD), it doesn't exactly take risks.

http://www.clear-uk.org/tax-regulate/

A recent report suggests the UK economy could gain over £6 Billion from the legalisation - this isn't science fiction, it could be done with a government with big enough balls.

However I cannot have any sympathy for police, not just because of the law (they have no choice to uphold) basically puts them at war with the citizens of this country. 

The reason I can have no sympathy is because the police chiefs got involved in politics and demanded that Brown reclassify cannabis back to class C during his 'leadership'

Dear JE Jones,

I enclose now a copy of a letter that I will take with me tonight to the police office in Pwllheli along with an English translation of my own doing.
I'm sorry I couldn't let youknow of the intention revealed in the letter beforehand, but if I did that doubtless I would put the Office of the National Party in danger and suspicion. Therefore, Valentine and I and DJ kept the entire thing a secret between us until this hour.
But I'm quietly confident that in our operation tonight we are doing what is a responsibility and a necessity for us for the country that we gave our best days trying to defend and raise and free.
Since it's necessary that some people suffer over Wales, we commanded the honour of being amongst the first.
I will telephone in the morning if I am allowed to, from Pwllheli's police station.

Regards, with some urgency

The bus services were a farce. They were slow as hell stopping at all the old station sites negating any advantages of having a bus and were extremely unpopular because of how inconvenient they were especially compared to their lost rail service.
Bustitution was a failure and all those bus services were themselves withdrawn within two years.

Frankly the Beeching report was about closing railways rather than making the network profitable which it failed to do.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"I feel sorry for you that you didn't get enough support coming to Oxford :( it's a shame but it's an issue of secondary schools needing to nurture their best students for their future, not to just try to even the playing field. Like you said, the structure and culture ends up discriminating against anyone who is ""too smart"" and this needs to change, but it's up to the schools and government to do this.

People have to understand that the purpose of universities are not to fight against social inequality, they are there to find the smartest and most talented young people in subjects and nurture them into highly educated and valuable adults for society.

I know that oxford bends over backwards to support poorer schools, trying to encourage the best students to apply whatever their background. I myself have been involved in mentoring programmes to give application, personal statement and interview advise as well as general encouragement to smart students from under achieving schools. But we can only do so much!

I have also been involved with Oxford applications and interviews and I can tell you that with the paper application, your background will be taken into account when considering your grades and personal statement (which is worth very little since all the statements are pretty much the same - since I was but a twinkle in my father's eye, I have always been interested in X...).

However, once the applicants arrive for interview, they are truly on their own. I believe that when it comes face to face, the tutors care very little about background, they care only about your intelligence. But don't panic! Because it's not a test of your knowledge so much as it is a test of your problem solving skills (in the sciences anyway). True, there is obviously a difference when you are drilled beforehand and confident, but really, if you're smart and show potential, you will make it.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"I feel sorry for you that you didn't get enough support coming to Oxford :( it's a shame but it's an issue of secondary schools needing to nurture their best students for their future, not to just try to even the playing field. Like you said, the structure and culture ends up discriminating against anyone who is ""too smart"" and this needs to change, but it's up to the schools and government to do this.

People have to understand that the purpose of universities are not to fight against social inequality, they are there to find the smartest and most talented young people in subjects and nurture them into highly educated and valuable adults for society.

I know that oxford bends over backwards to support poorer schools, trying to encourage the best students to apply whatever their background. I myself have been involved in mentoring programmes to give application, personal statement and interview advise as well as general encouragement to smart students from under achieving schools. But we can only do so much!

I have also been involved with Oxford applications and interviews and I can tell you that with the paper application, your background will be taken into account when considering your grades and personal statement (which is worth very little since all the statements are pretty much the same - since I was but a twinkle in my father's eye, I have always been interested in X...).

However, once the applicants arrive for interview, they are truly on their own. I believe that when it comes face to face, the tutors care very little about background, they care only about your intelligence. But don't panic! Because it's not a test of your knowledge so much as it is a test of your problem solving skills (in the sciences anyway). True, there is obviously a difference when you are drilled beforehand and confident, but really, if you're smart and show potential, you will make it.

true,GwalstawdIeithoedd,null,null,"Mr John Saunders Lewis is the leader of the National Party, and son to the late Rev. Lodwig Lewis, minister MC Seacombe, and grandson to the Rev. Dr. Owen Thomas, Liverpool.
Mr Saunders Lewis was born in Liscard, and was educated at Liverpool University. He is a lecturer of Welsh at Swansea University, a literary critic, and the author of titles on matters of interest to Wales.
In 1931's general election, he stood as an independent candidate for the University of Wales, but was defeated by the National Liberals.

The Rev. Lewis E Valentine is the minister at the Welsh Baptists church in Llandudno, and has been a member of the National Party for years.
He stood as the Party representative in Arfon in the 1929 General Election, but was defeated. He was a student at Bangor University when the war broke. He joined the army and served in France. Afterwards, he finished his course at university, where he was President of the Students Representative Council. He married in 1925 in Llandudno, to the daughter of the late Mr William jones and Mrs Jones, Ormonde, Pen y Gogarth, her the granddaughter of Rice Edwards, Bala who is said to be the original of Rhys Lewis in Daniel Owen's novel.

Mr DJ Williams is a native of Cardigan, and he is known as the author of novels and stories about old characters. His wife is sister to the Rev. William Evans (Wil Ifan), Bridgend.
Mr Williams has been a teacher in Fishguard County School for around 20 years. Until last year he was an English teacher at the school, and then was appointed as a Welsh teacher.
'DJ' as he is known to those who know him, was a popular man in Fishguard and a staunch Eisteddfod-goer. He was a member of the Fishguard National Eisteddfod Executive Committee, and has presided, led and judged in a plethora of smaller Eisteddfods.

The place for the bombing school is slightly to the north of the road leading from Pwllheli to Llanbedrog - some two miles from the town. It is not near Porth Neigwl, and it came to prominence recently because of the Air Force's intent to build a bombing school in Llyn. It was intended to build a place for the Airmen to live, and a place to keep the aeroplanes in Penyberth. The targets to aim at with the bombs will be in Porth Neigwl itself, and a few small huts for the watchmen. When I visited Penyberth a few hours after the fire was discovered, there were only a few workers there. Some of them were employed by the Air Force's authorities to build a road from the main road, through the fields, to the camp itself. The fire did not disrupt their work - they are workers under the Air Force administration's control. Having reached the camp we met with one of the officers....[cuts off here]

true,PeaSouper,english,American/Canadian Expat,"Note that this number is before taxes and NI.  After taxes, he'll really only have about £2,650 of that left to spend on a house.  

This sort of opinion might not be popular around here, but that's really not that unreasonable for an expat package for a top executive.  As part of my expat package, I get an allowance of about £1k per week for a house, and I'm just a lowly IT guy, not the goddamned head of the Bank of England.  

Why are these sorts of things reasonable?  When you want a professional from another country to do a job here in the UK or anywhere else, you need to make it worthwhile for them to leave their life in their home country.  You need to ensure them that they will not endure a decrease in their standard of living by expatriating.  If you don't offer that, why would they leave?

Unfortunately for the UK, and London in particular, the cost of living here is ridiculously high, particularly where housing is involved.  My £1000 p.w. allowance, which may seem ridiculously outsized to some people, allows me to live in a house that's... about the same size as the house I lived in back in Texas.  (I bought that house in Texas for about £120,000 by the way.)  

Same deal with Mark Carney.  He's the head of the Bank of Canada right now.  I'm sure he lives a very good life in Ottawa, in a house much larger than the 3 bedroom place that I had in Texas and have here in London.  I don't see how you're going to convince a guy like that to move to London without a similar (but obviously much richer) arrangement.

&gt; My point is that we've thrown in our lot with an industry which, if needs must, could uproot and move.

This is the case for essentially any modern industry.

&gt;Many of our graduates go to the city - 2 friends of mine are qualified engineers working as insurance brokers. They come from an ever shrinking pool of science graduates (around 15%).

This is a problem with the way we teach people that all degrees are created equal, and also an issue with a lack of preferential funding for STEM degrees.

&gt;When you contrast this with China (around 50%)

Most Chinese degrees aren't worth the paper they're printed on - we have nothing to fear from Chinese innovation at this point, their primary way of ""innovating"" currently is just to copy or steal American or European tech. They're at the stage of Japan in the 1950's but with far less morality.

Perhaps.

1. Do an access course at college. This is just a part time course which earns you a qualification to attend University. This is probably the easiest way to get into Uni. I know a couple of people who have received conditional offers this year to attend Uni doing this type of course.

2. Open University course. Depending on what course you want to do, this is a good option as you can keep working and not financially cripple yourself going to Uni.

true,PeaSouper,english,American/Canadian Expat,"Firstly, that doesn't sound like an ""attack"" - I appreciate the response.

Of course no one reasonably expects that the housing costs in Texas will be anywhere near the housing costs in London.  In general, if someone is contemplating a move on their from the US to Europe, they should expect to seriously downsize their standard of living.  Everything is just way more expensive here, but particularly housing.  

However, the expat situation is a bit different.  Organization expatriate employees (or hire a foreign person but offer an expat package) when they can't find anyone local to fill a need, and when they envisage the role being filled by the foreign employee on a temporary basis.  Often that foreign employee isn't willing to drastically lower their standard of living, so if the cost makes sense, the expat package is offered.  

&gt; The important hiring point should be 'what would it take to get a person who could do this job', rather than 'what would it take to hire Mark Carney from Canada'. 

Absolutely. Hiring foreigners is expensive. Visa costs, relocation, and all that is before any housing allowance. But sometimes it's the most cost effective thing to do. I'm not saying that's the case here - while a local hire would have surely been far cheaper, I really can't comment on whether or not they could have found someone with the skill set of Mark Carney to do this job, at the price of a local hire.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Most of London Underground is in fact above ground, especially true on the Met. There are no ""fast / slow"" lines on the Met's underground sections, and no kinking because there's not a lot of sun down there either.

It's still only a problem which happens when we have unusually hot weather and in the mets case is exacerbated by the high use of the line.

&gt;The bus services were a farce. Because Beeching's report wasn't fully implemented.

As for wingers, Snodgrass has been class, but Pilks has been below-par for long periods this summer, and Bennett doesn't quite seem Prem class, so it makes sense to sign a decent left sided winger at least. Redmond or Robson-Kanu perhaps, although I still think Kamara can do a job wide-left.

Nothing unusual about that, however they can only do it if you have dual nationality, they cannot leave someone stateless.

That's something I'm not sure about, however Jacqui Smith did bar Geert Wilders from entering the UK (which was subsequently overturned rather than ruled illegal), and there are provisions for EU member states deporting EU citizens if they represent a threat to public order, public security or public health. 

&gt; Where can we send them? What if they would face torture or illegal imprisonment at their home country? Can we guarantee that if we send them somewhere else, they will not be sent back to their home country

true,davidpbrown,null,null,"If Bitcoin succeeds, it will be in large part due to that government has not provided a stable currency.

As an aside: There are good reasons for the mistakes that were made; that naivety perhaps was inevitable from overcooking the chance to pull money forward in leveraging and some parts of the world would overdo that and some would overproduce and some will be middle of the road - the UK in a prime position to abuse its position and take the short term lazy option there.

Communication of knowledge, however its chewed by the media, can only help people better understand the world and the options available to them. There is no good reason for the Government to fear Bitcoin - hell,  locking pound to bitcoin would be a interesting fast track fix for our problems - good olde reality check in full. We have a certain amount of trauma to go through, to fix what was actioned over the last decades. We have then also a long way to go to correct people's understanding of their place in society; the role of Government; and key issues of sustainability, and quality of life. So, getting people to think about Bitcoin's potential can only be good for us all by helping move our understanding of reality forward.

When the US dollar collapses; which could happen very rapidly, having some alt option providing a flexibility could be very useful to the US. Other currencies like the GBP perhaps can plough on through but the US dollar might leave less than no confidence in its future stability. So, for the US, it's impt Bitcoin does work or that there is an easy alternate option that is integrated to a greater wealth worldwide - that integration then providing stability back to a wrecked US economy perhaps. For those in debt, currencies need to be devalued and debt's repaid as much as is practical but the dollar .. I don't know.. to me looks like a crash and burn disaster. Japan also - how has that economy not crashed.. consensus perhaps but that might only hold for a while.

Currency = idea = confidence = stability. Perhaps it doesn't matter what the currency is, so much as there is a fair distribution of it. With .gov having shown themselves untrustworthy and with Bitcoin not needing a potentially incompetent oversight from .gov et banksters, maybe it's a better option for the People regardless of what 'they' show they can do to fix the mess now?

Defence is where we have problems.  Skrtel has lost it (or can't be bothered, not sure which).  Carra is retiring.  Boss doesn't fancy Coates.  Not even 100% certain of Agger's greatness after the season we have had, and we are all agreed that Reina has at times been woeful.  Considerable investment needed along the backline with cover at leftback needed too.  That's 3 to 4 players needed which will only be prt-funded by player sales and the removal of Carra's salary.  Add in a right winger, take into account that funds may be limited to 20 or 30m GBP on top of player sales and there's no money to squander on a part of the squad that's already got plenty of depth, if not quite the strength we would like.

Ultimately, what all this is about right now, is that Xabi, like a number of Madrid players, is waiting to see what happens in the summer with Mourinho, who will be his successor, what other players come and go.  Mourinho creates such an intense bond with his players, asks so much loyalty that the club will not be the same after he goes.  Think Inter after he left.  Rafa walked into the toughest job in world football right at that exact moment in time. And on that subject, what if Rafa succeeds Mourinho again (unlikey now I admit)?  This is the man that Xabi is convinced tried to run him out of Liverpool, for all that Rafa says it was H&amp;G that forced his hand.  
Xabi is keeping his options open I think and this saga will run, but lets not get carried away, the likelihood of his return is slim.  
A final factor is wages.  At his age, this is his last big contract.

&gt;The '8,200-strong petition' was in the main signed before the proposal was released so should be deemed invalid. Lots of people I know signed it when they were told the store would be a huge Tesco four times the size of the one actually proposed by Asda. Furthermore they were told it would include destruction of the swimming baths and other such scare stories. There is also a large section of Marple that would like the Asda and, of course, a new and much needed college. Much of the MIA campaign seems hypocritical. Many MIA supporters themselves are happy to use large supermarkets in neighbouring towns and clog up the roads there. They speak of the effect on local shops yet are happy with a store the same size being built on Marple's main car park! Some local traders have been perplexed by these plans! The traffic here would be just as bad. It was always thought that Asda would be turned down at first. Let's hope their real campaign to appeal starts now. Good luck to Asda.

I think it would, overall, be nefast to the show. No matter who would pick up the role would be scrutinized by default because it would be...well, weird.

We've always known the Doctor to be male. For fifty years now, even. 1200 years... To suddenly become female, I mean, what?

**If** they decide to do this then they need to give it a proper explanation and not just ""because randomness"", imo. 

The Doctor exhibits a lot of ""neutral"" qualities, so in that sense he doesn't really have a ""gender"" per se, although he seems to strongly prefer women in a romantic sense and pretty much all of his non-""neutral"" qualities are male oriented.

That actually brings up another issue. Would she still prefer women if the Doctor was a woman? Is it being straight (mostly) that's part of his persona or is it preferring women? Would he suddenly prefer male companions?

Not to mention the issue of River. How would that relationship transform between them? (if she's even around by then).

i don't think youth automatically precludes an actor from playing a convincing doctor; i just would like to see the character played by someone older, who can project an air of authority. it's much more difficult for a younger actor to do that, which is why the sort of naif that smith portrays plays to his strengths as an actor. however, there aren't many new directions in which a younger actor than smith could take the role.

I don't think FPTP is a great system but I'm doing Politics A Level at the moment and it seems to me that a large amount of the problem is self-inflicted. These two parties only have large amounts of power because people vote for them. If nobody voted for them, if people actually voted for the parties that really represented their views, then neither Labour or Conservative would be powerful anymore and the problem would be solved.

Plus, just because the party you voted for doesn't get to power doesn't mean that your vote was wasted, it just means your choice was not the rest of the people's choice.",0,1364422618,null,0,false,0,c93n0uu,t3_1b2bg7,t1_c93n0uu,t1_c93mxxz,null,1431724435,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; I see what you're saying, but surely the only reason these two parties are the only ones with a ""serious chance of winning"" are that way is because you and others think that way?

This is entirely true, but you have to play the game you are given. Part of the idea behind AV was that it would mitigate this. You could vote for who you really wanted in with your first vote, then vote against whoever you didn't want in with your second vote. 

&gt; I don't think FPTP is a great system but I'm doing Politics A Level at the moment and it seems to me that a large amount of the problem is self-inflicted. These two parties only have large amounts of power because people vote for them. If nobody voted for them, if people actually voted for the parties that really represented their views, then neither Labour or Conservative would be powerful anymore and the problem would be solved.

Politics is about pragmatism a lot of the time. I think Labour and the Tories would still get a lot of votes if we switched to PR, because a lot of the other parties don't actually offer serious programs for change (on the basis they won't get in). You can't expect people not to vote tactically, because the likelihood is that other people will. It's much like the [Prisoner's Dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). Maybe if you started all the parties from scratch and banned election forecasts then people wouldn't so readily, but this is the way the game works. If you want a different result you have to change the rules. 

&gt; Plus, just because the party you voted for doesn't get to power doesn't mean that your vote was wasted, it just means your choice was not the rest of the people's choice.

Protest votes are in my opinion of limited use. The Lib Dems and UKIP have managed to build up enough support to both cause the main parties trouble, but the other parties below that have negligible influence over British politics. There's only so much one can do without seats. 

If we take a simple left-right spectrum, and your views are on the extreme left, you have a choice. Either vote for an extreme left party that best represents your view, or vote for the centre-left party that actually has a chance of getting the seat. In FTFP the best choice is to vote for the centre-left party. Even though they aren't as you'd like them to be, voting them into power creates a society that is closer to your ideals than not voting for them and increasing the likelihood that the centre-right party gets in. Tactical voting is entirely rational given the circumstances. ",0,1364424752,null,0,false,0,c93nrsk,t3_1b2bg7,t1_c93nrsk,t1_c93n0uu,null,1431724756,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

However, despite Rusty's commitment and desire, I think Whittaker would be my first choice RB, so I wouldn't want to be forced into moving him in the event of injury to Garrido, so another LB would be nice. I think Ryan Bennett was forced to play there against West Ham in January when Garrido and Whittaker were out, and whilst I didn't watch it, apparently he did ok, but nothing special.

We still need to sign Garrido on a permanent deal too! We keep being linked to Curtis Davies of Birmingham too, and they're very short on money, so a deal there wouldn't surprise me, for maybe £2-3m or so.

At DM, Johnson has been consistently very good at breaking play up, and playing the simple ball, but that's his limit. I've only once this season see him play a ball over the top, he just doesn't have the creativity to make chances from deep. Earlier this season, Tettey did the same defensive job, but was also comfortable carrying the ball forward from deep, and he has a wicked shot on him, his passing was better too. I'm hoping him carrying an injury was the only reason that stopped. I agree Howson is better played further forward, so think we need some genuine competition in this area.

Sure, he pings some shockers off, but he tends to land a decent ball down the channels. I think with Fox no longer getting in the team, Johsnon is trying to provide those wider passes. He's nowhere near as good as Fox, but he has certainly improved on last season.

LB is just an area that needs sorting. I agree Whits is probably going to be the first choice RB. That's harsh on Martin, who has been fantastic, but he is a bit slower, not quite as neat and I have to say, his tackling could be improved on. I still think he'll be the first choice defender on the bench, and could even be that decent cover at CB. Back to the LB, with Garrido just on a loan (Though I suspect we'll get him permanently in the summer) and our only other LB being Tierney, who has pretty much not featured this season, You'd think another LB would be on the list.

I come from a little village in north England and it was a bit of a shock for me- where I come from, almost everyone speaks with the same accent.

There are also student societies for most areas of the world, so you could find friends who speak your language easily enough, I guess.

Oooh.... automatic ticket machines? Tbh, you'll find situations like that in any large-ish city- people immigrate and accents vary, it's how things work. 

I didn't know that Edinburgh did foundation courses. There are other universities in the city that probably do (Napier/QMU/Heriot Watt) but I don't know much about them. I always got the impression that they filled in any 'gaps' in education- so it's worth it if there's a gap to fill.
