If we switched to a 3-1-2-2-2 we could fit all 3:

Miglolet

Toure-Sktrel-Sakho

Lucas

Hendo-Gerrard

Coutinho-Moses (whilst Coutinho's out play Sterling/Ibe/Aspas)

SAS

This also means we can play Allen as well as the others in an attacking position.


EDIT: I saw the formation line up as

------22

--4--37--17

------21

----14-8

10-------12

-----7-15

And yes we'd have little to no width but if we want our best midfielders there and Gerrard we'd have to sacrifice somewhere. Personally I think we either play Gerrard #10 or drop him for Hendo in the current 3-4-1-2

I'm a UKip supporter and would quite happily personally send a non UK citizen back to wherever they come from if they are bleeding, as the NATIONAL health service is just for us, just to put this comment in perspective. I am not a user who follows the hivemind here at all.

Now, if they charge us to use the NHS, I'd quite happily join any rioting and even endorse it. We will never be a nation where people die because they don't have enough money to live. I'd die for this country and contrary to popular belief (on reddit) believe it's one of, if not the best country in the world. 

I respect the police, understand the implications of places like the congo and what no 'law enforcement' means for the people, which is utter lawlessness and a complete breakdown of civilisation. Whenever anybody says 'scum', I explain how they aren't and that that attitude is an ideological sheep attitude and they need to think about it properly. 

However if we're rioting because our government is going to let people DIE FOR NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY TO LIVE, you'd be with us or against us.

We'll march with people of all ages, colours, backgrounds and wealth, the whole nation would rise against this. 

I support restructuring, cutting costs, making it more efficient. But you can NEVER charge for it. This is the one issue that ties the nation together. 

I'd volunteer first in a draft and give my life for this country, as would many other men of principle. These would not be riots that are about shit hole communities with idiots in them who are unhappy with their lives (which also needs addressing and I believe UKip could do this too as they aren't afraid to have to be politically correct), these would be riots that would never die down until people can live regardless of wealth.

Instructions like that are there for a reason. On both Windows and Linux one can manually restart services either via a GUI or with things like powershell or command line. However, getting a receptionist to remember what cryptically named service has to be restarted with what command isn't going to happen. A reboot is easier because it's a simple action one can repeat without any real training, and will fix problems with poorly coded apps or services that fail without a trouble ticket being raised (which usually have a 3-4 hour SLA for 1st response, let alone resolution).

I agree about the numbering being logical in some cases but I'm not sure what number we would pick given our location.  Nothing would fit logically so you might as well pick one out of a hat. I myself quite like No 36.  Not because there are 35 other buildings in the area but its kinda a nice number that rolls of the tongue easily.  

The problem with numbering buildings in some rural areas is there is no cohesive plot system or defined start and end to the area.  A numbering system works well on a designed estate or on a road that has a name with a defined start and end - but on in an area that has had 600 years of fairly random organic development, in practice it be just as confusing as a house name.  

As an aside, how would you deal with properties that for the last few hundred years have never had a number?  Would you change the name that's marked on an OS map to a number?

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"Up until recently I don't think there's been a real problem with EU citizens claiming benefits in the UK. Our benefits are fairly meagre and the residence test stops people turning up and claiming without contributing. 

The Greek situation may have changed that. I know a Greek family who just sold up, bought an old car, and travelled across Europe to the UK. One of the parents has managed to find work, so they are already better off than if they had stayed in Greece. On an individual basis I have tremendous admiration for them: they have shown a huge amount of courage, effort and determination.

But multiply that by tens of thousands, and we may end up with a huge number of Greek families arriving in the UK, some unable to find work, most ineligible for benefits. Either we let them beg on the streets and go hungry, or we offer some emergency assistance. If we offer assistance we encourage more people to come over. 

My feeling is that as fellow Europeans and EU members we have to do our bit, but it's not a complete no brainer. 

There might be a similar sort of movement when the restrictions are removed from Romania. But until the crash, Romania had a strong and rapidly growing economy, and it's still growing at 2.2%.  Unemployment is 7.3 percent which is much better than the EU average of around 11% and slightly better than the UK. They will soon be prosperous enough that it won't be very attractive to travel on spec to the UK.

If it can be proven that the pornographic website being paid is hosting Child Porn or Beastiality for example then there are ALREADY LAWS which prevent payment.

The censorship of the press is like the censorship of the internet in what the government is attempting to do with the press reform bill.

Plus anyone who uses the internet can disprove the notion that the internet is just about pornography that they use to scare the old people other uniformed users.

They tried to use the same argument back in the 90s. What we got back then was a filter that filters out extreme content (child porn etc) by a vigilante group called the IWF. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Watch_Foundation 

Its not run by the government, its run by volunteers that already filter out sites on their judgement and its been here since the 90's. This alone is a travesty for free speech because although they claim to just filter out sick material no one knows what they actually filter because they never publish a list.

Oh and this isn't in the future its been here since the 90s on dial-up, and you pay for it because 'The IWF is an incorporated charity, limited by guarantee, and largely funded by voluntary contributions from UK communications service providers, including ISPs, mobile phone operators, Internet trade associations, search engines, hardware manufacturers, and software providers. It also receives funding from the Association for Payment Clearing Services and the European Union'.

Famous incidents of overzealous blocking (copied from the wikipedia article posted earlier)

Sex stories

On 26 July 2007, UK tabloid newspaper The Daily Star reported that it had discovered an online text story about British (adult) pop group Girls Aloud that it described as ""a chilling story detailing each singer's gory death in scenes that could be straight out of a horror movie"", characterizing its author as ""a vile internet psycho"" and ""a cyber-sicko"". The news story said that The Daily Star had reported the content of the hosting website, ""Kristen Archives"" (a subsite of the ASSTR archive), to the IWF, and that the IWF had traced the site to the US. It also claimed that Interpol had been notified to help track down the site's operators and the writer of the story. An IWF spokesperson was reported as saying that since the site was hosted in the US, it fell outside the organization's remit, but that they were aware of the site. The spokesperson added that the site also contained ""child abuse fantasy stories"" and that they had passed on details of it to the British police.[36]

The story, entitled ""Girls (Scream) Aloud"",[37] had been posted from within the jurisdiction of the UK on a website hosted in the US. Although submitted under a pseudonym, the posting included a traceable email address. Officers from Scotland Yard’s Obscene Publications Unit decided to take action over the story after consulting the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), and on 25 September 2008 it was announced that the author, Darryn Walker, was to be prosecuted for the online publication of material that the police and the CPS believed was obscene. It was the first such prosecution for written material in nearly two decades, and was expected to have a significant impact on the future regulation of the Internet in the UK.[38]

Walker appeared in court on 22 October 2008 to face charges of ""publishing an obscene article contrary to Section 2(1) of the Obscene Publications Act 1959"". He was granted unconditional bail, and his case was initially set for trial on 16 March 2009.[39] However, at a directions hearing in January, the defendant made it known that given the seriousness of the case he would be represented by a QC (Queen's Counsel), following which the Crown Prosecution Service gave notice of its intention to similarly employ a QC, and the trial was postponed to 29 June 2009.

He appeared at Newcastle Crown Court on 29 June 2009 but the case was abandoned on what was supposed to be the first day of the trial, following the introduction of evidence from an IT expert. The CPS said that it had originally charged Walker as it believed that the story in question could be ""easily accessed"" by young fans of Girls Aloud. However, the IT expert showed that the article could only be located by those specifically searching for such material. A spokesperson for the CPS said that the prosecution was unable to provide sufficient evidence to contradict this new evidence and therefore took the decision that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. Judge Esmond Faulks, presiding, returned a formal verdict of not guilty to the charge of ""publishing an obscene article"".[40]

On 5 December 2008, the IWF system started blacklisting a Wikipedia article covering the Scorpions' 1976 album Virgin Killer, and an image of its original LP cover art which appeared on that article. Users of some major ISPs, including BT, Vodafone, Virgin Media/Tesco.net, Be/O2, EasyNet/UK Online/Sky Broadband, PlusNet, Demon, and TalkTalk (Opal Telecom), were unable to access the filtered content. Although controversial, the album and image are still available, both through Internet shopping sites and from physical shops. The image had been reported to the IWF by a reader, and the IWF determined that it could be seen as potentially illegal. The IWF estimated the block affected 95% of British residential users.[41][42] The IWF has since rescinded the block,[43][44] issuing the following statement:[45]
“ 	[...] the image in question is potentially in breach of the Protection of Children Act 1978. However, the IWF Board has today (9 December 2008) considered these findings and the contextual issues involved in this specific case and, in light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability, the decision has been taken to remove this webpage from our list. 	”

Additionally, many UK Internet users were unable to edit Wikipedia pages unless registered and logged in with Wikipedia.[46] This is reported to be due to the single blacklisted article causing all Wikipedia traffic from ISPs using the system to be routed through a transparent proxy server. Wikipedia distinguishes unlogged-in users from each other by their IP address, so interpreted all unlogged-in users from a particular ISP as a single user editing massively from the proxy address, which triggered Wikipedia's anti-abuse mechanism, blocking them.[47]

On 14 January 2009 some UK users reported that all of the 85 billion pages of the Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) had been blocked, although the IWF's policy is to block only individual offending webpages, not whole domains.[48] According to IWF chief executive Peter Robbins this was due to a ""technical hitch"".[49] Because the Internet Archive's web site contained URLs on the IWF's blacklist, requests sent there from Demon Internet carried a particular header, which clashed with the Internet Archive's internal mechanism to convert web links when serving archived versions of web pages.[35] The actual blocked URL which had caused the incident never became publicly known.[35]

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"There is a difference though, there is no competition in a lot of the sectors which the governments have privatised over the years. There is literally no competition in water, for example, so they can charge silly money without you having a choice of moving to a different company. It's the same with trains, where they can't have more than one company running on one line, meaning they also have a monopoly over that service. 

Also, it often leads to a lower level of service. Let's say the government spends £100 on prisons in the UK. To save money, they privatise the prisons and give a big contract to G4S, who the government only give £90. However, G4S also want to make a profit on the job, so they skim £10 off the top, meaning we only have £80 to look after the prisons. The argument against this is that it breeds competition and efficiency, but when companies have a monopoly on that service, there is no need to evolve. I think cases such as at HMP Oakwood, Britain's largest privately run prison, show this. 

At the end of the day, the main aim of these big businesses is to make money, and this often, if not always comes at the expense of the people at the bottom.

Under the current proposals, the taxpayer pays for the plant and trains the staff, the taxpayer subsidies the service provision, the taxpayer underwrites any losses, but somehow space is made for a private supplier to cream off a profit. 

With a fully private system, suppliers would have to earn their profits by delivering a good quality and efficient service.

This makes 14 ""Doctors"" that have existed using regeneration which is already illegal in the ""Regeneration Continuity"" that most Whovians have continuously brought up.

My best guess is the 50th Anniversary which deals with the Time War will involve the revelation that The Hurt Doctor will have stolen more regenerations or had been given by the High Council more regenerations and kept it a secret. Much to the same deal The Master received when he was given more regenerations. The additional detail of revealing that The Doctor cannot give the regenerations back and must keep them will easily solve this issue. They don't ever have to specify a definitive number of how many The Hurt Doctor received just that he got more.

-Tactically very astute and not afraid to change things around or experiment. 

-We can see he learnt from the S'hampton game where what he used didn't work. 

-He also has the capacity to change his mind about players (Shelvey seemed to be a bit of a project for him, but was big enough to see it wasn't really working). 

-Handled 'Suarezgate' outstandingly with John Henry. 

-Not afraid to give the likes of Sterling, Ibe, Suso, Sama and Wisdom a go. He obviously rates them and gives them a go, for good or for worse but i would rather he did it than didnt. 

-He has a plan which is more than can be said for our last 2 managers. 




Cons:

-I feel he has good man management skills but i am concerned that he couldn't get the most out a player like Nuri Sahin.

-Since he has become manager we have won very few games from behind and i sort of question his ability to 'throw the kitchen sink' at a team. No plan B i guess.

-I also feel Carroll could have been a great player for the club but wasn't really given the opportunity. But seeing as Sturridge is doing as good as he is and Carroll is terminally injured, i don't really care.

true,shnookumsmuffin,null,null,"I posted a similar list on another person's thread, but I thought I'd post it to you too, because I wanted to include pubs/eats which sometimes get over looked. :)

 Some cool pubs:
 Boda (Cozy, art on the walls)   
The Pond (SO many beers, out of the way, near a cinema/shopping centre)   
The Secret Arcade (about 100 kinds of vodka, unusual place)   
Canny Man's (Awesome decor, walls are covered in antiques, really nice atmosphere)
The Jinglin' Geordie (Very small and down one of Edinburgh's most iconic tiny alleyways, live music sometimes)   
Bar Soba (Really cool decor, cocktails, food, music.)  
 I mention those pubs because they are good ones which don't seem to get mentioned here.

 Food!
The Mosque Kitchen (Cheapest curry in Edinburgh, the outdoors seating is very hidden away in the middle of town, you eat with plastic cutlery and you'll never be hungry again.)  
Frisky (For froyo!)  
 Eteaket (Super cutesy tea place with loads of kind of tea and cakes/sandwiches. Your girlfriend might love it and you might not.)  
 Tex Mex (Hidden away place does reasonably-sized tex mex and they make their own range of hot sauce!)   
Los Cardos/Illegal Jacks (Both also for amazing burritos!)  
 Espy (Right on Portobello beach, big portions and it's a pub too.)  
Hard Rock Cafe (Giant portions. and milkshakes)  
Red Box Noodle Bar (Amazing place to get a box of noodles with your choice of noodle, meat, sauce etc.)  
 Mary's Milk Bar (Best ice cream ever with unusual flavours)  
The Zulu Lounge (Fantastic food and milkshakes with an African theme. In Morningside which is quite nice for food/shopping anyway.)  


Stuff to do
 Climb Arthurs Seat (If that appeals...)  
Arcades in Portobello (If you want to waste money/play pool)  
Visit Greyfriars Graveyard (It's pretty awesome)  
Ocean Terminal (Huge shopping centre/cinema, out of the centre of town)  
 Butterfly World (Great place to go to see butterflies up close, and snakes)  
Visit the Botanic Gardens/Newhailes House (Outdoorsy places to go)  
Roslin Glen/Roslin Chapel (Super famous historic chapel with paid entry, and for free the most BEAUTIFUL Roslin Glen, a long bus ride but worth the trip if you love nature)   
 Surgeon's Hall Museum (A pretty creepy museum, probably not 100% tourist-free)  
 Museum of Childhood (Again likely to contain some tourists, but it's a small, sweet museum with toys + games from throughout the ages.)  
 Climb the Scott Monument (Right in the centre of town, it'll be tall and probably very windy!)  
 Walk the Water of Leith (A wonderful, very long walk along the water. You'll want to plan your route.)

Tactically I don't know if anything is necessarily comming together or we've had a run of either shit or uninterested opponents but he prefers tactics involving players like Coutinho and Sturridge over Carroll and Downing so any change of direction was progress.

His transfer dealings have been mixed but overall positive though there's a question about how much they are his choice anyway. 

As many unsuccessful signings have been made as successful ones but there haven't been any big money failures (except maybe Allen) and there have been 2 superbargins in Sturridge and Coutinho.

What I do like about him is that he has been ruthless in getting rid of anyone he doesn't rate or that doesn't work out. I enjoyed that he didn't hedge his bets and give Carrol a chance. You're shit? You are gone. Players he has signed have been gone in a season when they didn't kick on.

* Hurt Doctor is actually The Valeyard, plucked out of the Matrix by The Time Lords to fight in the Time War.
* Hurt Doctor Valeyard was the one who actually used the moment to destroy the Time Lords
* The Doctor, fearing that he is destined to become The Valeyard/Hurt Doctor at some point, has always blamed himself and held himself responsible for the atrocities committed in the Time War.
* The Doctor is able to go break the time lock via his own timestream and go back into The Time War with Clara, encounters 10 along the way somehow, yada yada etc.
* The Doctors encounter the mysterious time lady in her own timeline right after the events of End of Time, who turns out to be either Susan or Romana or somebody from the past considering this is the 50th anniversary episode.
* The time lady convinces what's left of the council to grant the Doctor unlimited regenerations (probably against The Doctor's wishes) in order to negate the creation of The Hurt Doctor/Valeyard.  Since The Valeyard's reason for being evil was to expand his existence and steal 6's remaining regenerations, giving The Doctor infinite regenerations pretty much negates the reason for Hurt Doctor Valeyard's existence so he zaps out of the universe.  
* With The Valeyard no longer existing because of The Doctor's new unlimited regenerations, the moment is never used, the Time Lords are never destroyed, wibbly wobbly timey wimey, The Time Lords and Gallifrey are back.

In the not so distant past, he was sacked at Reading. The foundations were perfectly laid out for him at Swansea so I was worried about how well he'd be able to undertake a complete overhaul at Liverpool.

He seems like an extremely well rounded manager and as someone who worked his way up through the ranks starting from the very bottom as a manager, he is clearly a hard working and dedicated man.

Talking about how well rounded he is as a manager. He speaks well in the media, not just in a general sense, he defends the club well and has used the media a few times to give players a kick up the arse.

His tactical pragmatism has been very encouraging, we started last season with ""death-by-football"" and it wasn't working, we weren't making fast enough progress but after switching to a more direct attacking style with less impetus on retaining possession, our performances and form have improved and with consistency too.

It seems that Rodgers has set us up so whatever the situation, we can switch things around to accommodate injuries or form. We've recently seen a switch to 3-5-2 after we were hit by injuries and playing poorly (or not playing great football), despite winning.

Rodgers seems to have a trick up his sleeve for any problem we face.

If there are any negatives then transfers would be one, though it's impossible to say how much of a say that Rodgers has and the signings of Mignolet, Toure, Sakho, Coutinho and Sturridge have all been inspired, so it's hard to grumble too much.

Our cup runs (ha!) have been poor and after going out against Utd at Old Trafford in the league cup, I really want us to have a good go at the FA cup and hopefully add an eighth to our collection. 

To summarise, it's best to say that all those doubts and worries I had when he first joined, have been pretty much completely alleviated. The real judgement will come at the end of this season though.

Last season was about sorting the squad out, getting everyone singing from the same hymn sheet. It was a transitional season. We were brilliant in the second half, played beautiful football and we look like we're carrying on that form.

Now we expect something tangible, a trophy or a top four finish would show real progress and give Rodgers something concrete to define our progress under him.",0,1381712644,null,0,false,0,ccr547s,t3_1odrvj,t1_ccr547s,t3_1odrvj,null,1429141028,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

He brought in old ""familiar faces"" like Allen and Borini, even if neither has perhaps done enough to justify their price tag.

He made a number of bonehead errors in team selection last season that most fans could see a mile away. This was often due to an improper inclusion of Allen, which falls under the purview of a manager trying to force their own signings into the team to the detriment of the club. That said, these ""errors"" are also often the result of a new manager trying to put his style onto a club before the pieces are in place to fulfill that style.

In my opinion Rodgers has managed to keep us performing at and above where we were before he arrived. People underestimate just how difficult this period of transition is and for Rodgers to have handled it as he has says a lot.

I think he's earned a contract extension. We're performing, playing attractive football (fairly often) and developing a youthful core that can fill out our squad for the next decade.

So the cliché is broadly true - there's only one race, the human race.  However, it's churlish to deny the very real _experience_ of race, as people share similar life experiences, to which others who don't are often blind.  That's why people who never have to experience the daily grind of racist attitudes and discrimination are so quick to claim it doesn't exist (in Britain, the police, the work environment, our company etc.).  They are so immersed in their White privilege it isn't visible to them, but it advantages them every day in every way.  Of course, there are affluent Blacks, Asians, Chinese, etc., there are racist Blacks, Asians, Chinese etc. (indeed, some other cultures are highly racist), and there can be acts of discrimination against White people. But to talk about the loss of certain aspects of White privilege in our increasingly globalist culture as some sort of structural racism is laughable, and will be met with derision by most people with experience of genuine racism, and rightly so.

On the topic, if White boys from poor backgrounds are genuinely underperforming in schools, then it's right that attention be focused on them, although I suspect that it's more indicative of their class position, and perhaps a gender issue (the manner in which boys learn best), than anything else.  If the claim is merely the reactionary idea that we should be targeting the 'default' rather than supporting those who have traditionally been excluded from accessing the best of what society has to offer, then it is just that - reactionary - and an attempt to bolster White privilege.

While Martha rallies Earth to restore the Doctor to his Tenant incarnation via psychic powers over the Archangel network, it's never explicitly stated that the the regeneration count has also been restored.  So depending on how you count, after the psychic reset Tenant could still potentially count as the first incarnation of the Doctor since technically he didn't regenerate from ""Gandalf"" back to Tenant - thus the first regeneration after that would be from Tenant to Smith, so plenty of room for 11 more regenerations.  Or least until some other convenient way comes up to extend it another way (such as the Master getting more regenerations from the Time Lords).

I have worked with organisations like this in the past and this is one of the main problems they face; accusations of exclusion that result from either simple misunderstanding, lack of knowledge and in some cases malice.

The point of organisations like this is to focus on those who are already marginalised groups, not to serve them exclusively. It says so on the sites FAQ even. They would simply aim to attract groups who ordinarily would either be at some disadvantage or, exactly like you're doing now, interpret exclusivity where there is none. Watch the video testimonial.

true,Boiiing,null,null,"If you already have shares or funds inside an existing S&amp;S ISA wrapper, you can often transfer them to another provider's S&amp;S ISA - although this is more hassle for the two providers than just doing a cash transfer, so there will often be an admin fee. Not all providers let you hold every type of asset so sometimes you can't do it and instead have to sell the assets for cash (still under the wrapper) and transfer that cash to a new S&amp;S ISA provider and buy things from scratch inside his wrapper instead.

But your issue is that you can't ""transfer those shares under the tax-free wrapper"" because your RM shares are not under a tax free wrapper. They are just shares that you bought off the government in the outside world, and currently unwrapped. New subscriptions to ISA wrappers can only be made in cash, as there are limits to how much you can subscribe in a year and so they can take money off your debit card for an exact amount of pounds and pence but they can't accept other assets , like shares, whose value changes by the second. 

If you have any shares or funds out in the unwrapped real world outside an ISA that you want to put in an ISA, you have to sell the shares, get cash, and subscribe cash to the ISA. This is not specific to RM or any particular ISA provider, it is the government rule.

Many platforms will let you have shares and funds in the same ISA. TD Direct Investing, Hargreaves Lansdown, Charles Stanley Direct, Sippdeal, Best Invest - there are loads. They have different fee structures so some are better than others depending exactly what mix of shares versus funds you hold, and what particular funds you want to hold. For example Hargreaves Lansdown charge 0.5% p.a. to hold shares, and sometimes the funds they offer are the more expensive versions with a small amount of management fee rebated to you, while another provider would let you buy the 'clean' version of the fund with a lower management fee in the first place.

Of course, now you know that you need to sell the RM shares outside the wrapper in order to get the cash to buy them inside a wrapper, it might change your attitude to them. 

You paid £750 for the shares but you will get ~£1000 cash. If you put £1000 cash into an ISA wrapper and are about to re-buy the shares for £1000...  out of all the thousands of companies and funds (providing millions of investment combinations available to you) why the hell would you buy shares in a single company that has just gone up by 30% to its current fair market value? Surely someone like you with only £2000 of other investments should be investing in a mix of funds, providing diversification into lots of underlying companies around the world, rather than trying to pick a UK mail business and hoping that will go up in value instead of down.

Nearly all 'first time shareholders' profiting from the RM flotation should be cashing in their shares and putting the money to a sensible use (whether that's spending in their daily lives, or investing in investment funds), rather than holding the RM shares hoping for a rise in value and a few pounds of dividends if the staff don't strike too often. Of course RM might be a fine business to hold if it is only 0.5% of your portfolio. In your case, you seem to be overexposed to that one company at the expense of getting exposure to all the other companies in the world.",0,1381733797,null,0,false,0,ccrbdiy,t3_1oat78,t1_ccrbdiy,t3_1oat78,null,1429138025,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Did you even read it properly or were you simply too ready to be enraged that parsing the sentence for meaning took a back seat to engineering offence? Where in there does the Dr himself bring up ""research showing genetics as a possible reason for white boys""?

In fact where is any of the research aimed at white boys at all?

The linked story is [right there on the page!](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10200429/GCSE-results-influenced-by-childrens-genes-not-teaching.html) It explores the link between the parents results and intelligence level and those of the children. Race isn't even a factor in the study, yet somehow you've made it so.

You know minority groups would rather *not* have to be marginalised groups too right? We'd really like to enjoy life without stark reminders we're slightly different. This new effort to compete in the oppression Olympics that's in full swing is just dumb. Stop this shit.

From the very top comment to this one, upvoted and until now, many hours later, unchallenged, it's as if you're all coveting the struggle. There's nothing noble about being victim.

true,binlargin,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt; Race is largely a social construct as the poly-genetic variability which contributes most of the characteristics by which we stereotype 'racial groups' is often higher within these than across them.

I'm sorry but that smells far too much like a politically correct soundbite for it to true. It's a really clever weapon in a meme-war against racism which allows the one true narrative to attack anyone who even acknowledges race, snubbing all racial arguments before they even begin. I'm all for equality, but only fools believe their own propaganda. Let's not be fools.

Genetic variability within a group is the wrong thing to measure. Race is a social construct if and only if the ability to recognise racial features is itself socially constructed. Nobody denies that there's such a thing as family resemblance, race can be described as a higher order family resemblance which is selected not on genes but on their phenotypes.",0,1381736980,null,0,false,0,ccrbw9d,t3_1odgl5,t1_ccrbw9d,t1_ccr5jdj,null,1429137782,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

**Smith is 11, Capaldi is 12, and River Gave Doctor Extras.**

River Very pointedly indicated that the Doctor using his regeneration energy to heal her wrists were stupid, and since she transferred all of hers over to him... It could be that he is living off of her energies. 

River having only ever used 2 Regens, From Melody&gt; Mels&gt; River, means she had 10 left to give. If The Doctor actually did use up one then that means he has 9 others to live off of.


**Tennant is 10, MetaCrisis Doctor is 11, Smith is 12**

It was glossed over, but he did say he transferred his regen energy into the hand. so there it goes. one life in a jar, waiting to be Doctor Donna'ed.

Which might make Capaldi the Valeyard...

**We're counting wrong**

If the list is accurate

Birth 

1. Hartnell Regen 1
2. Troughton Regen 2
3. Pertwee Regen 3
4. Baker Regen4
5. Davison Regen 5
6. Baker Regen 6
7. McCoy Regen7
8. McGann Regen 8
9. Eccleston Regen 9
10. Tennant Regen 10
11. Smith Regen 11
12. Capaldi. Regen 12
13. ???

Death

Then there have clearly been 12 Doctors, but what if a Time Lord can live 13 lives. You don't need a Regeneration to start a Time Lords life. SO That's Life 1 Hartnell. After Each death, 1 of the 12 packets is used. which means by the end of Capaldi, the Doctor has only one regen left. This seems like the kind of simple world play moffat would go for.

**Capaldi is the original, Hartnel was the second life, Matt is actually 12**

The key wording here is who the Doctor is in title. Not his Birth Name but what his name means to him. He clearly distinguishes The new Doctor as not fit for the title, so maybe his Running, his mission, his Morale Certainty stems from the fact that he started out a monster and he has been trying to rectify past sins.

With that in place, then Maybe some Higglety pigglety Timey wimey logic could be utilized to get the Doctor knew lives. Because the Twist would be Big enough to allow the Audience to go with it.


**Same as before but Capaldi is back to being Number 12**

I like to think What the Doctor saw in the Time Vortex was his last incarnation. They discussed in the last Christmas special for Ten, that all time lord children are made to look into the schism, for reasons. Hence The Master going crazy, and the Doctor Running. 

What if the Doctor saw Capaldi, and knew from the beginning what he would become, and he spend his whole life running from fate and destiny, running to make up for what he would become, because he knew it would become a fixed point. 

He's Running in hopes of getting away from his Future, he is running in hope of changing his fate Think about that as you remember all the Doctors Crazy moments regarding being a lord of Time, the Time Lord Victorious, Understanding how to rewrite time, considering his ability to wipe out the Daleks, his desperate horror of destroying everyone in the Time war. It might have been a slow dawning realization that it was all continually happening.

**Lost Regen**

Time war Doctor is missing, we never got to see that Regen. So The obvious, what if McGann never Technically regened to Eckelston. What if some weird space time Kerfuffle occurred, and the doctor had his body modified some how, or Aged into Eckelston. Meaning Smith is 10.

**Something from the Original series**

It's possible, just maybe, that Moffat is remembering something from a long time ago in the original playthrough  of the series, that was super obscure, and brushed past, and is doing this as a nod to the original fans, but I find that doubtful because that would alienate a lot of the new fan base who would not be able to sit through the original series.

**Retcon this Puppy post haste**

It's possible, and Moffat is known for trying to pull the wool over peoples eyes, Sometimes successfully, so maybe he will write something in to fix it. Would be cheap.

Something to do with Changing the laws of the universe, or rewriting history Flashpoint Style. So Maybe we will end up with a New 52 of the Doctor Who brand. IF DC comics could do it then why not the show.


**For the Record:**

I do not count Ten regrowing his hand again as a use of a new Regen. If anything it is similar to Romana Changing her Appearance continually by choice as she regenerated, and the Doctor is just take advantage of the timing. River does the same thing.

I do not count what Matt Smith said in the Vent Chute during the Sarah Jane Adventures, he was only in two episodes of note so you guys can find that one, who don't know.

true,Yurilovescats,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"I don't like our current penal system - I think many people end up in jail due to bad circumstances, mental illness or even because they feel they have nowhere else to go (the re-offending rates seem to indicate this... far too many people go back to prison once they've been released). I'd rather we had a system heavily tilted towards rehabilitation, education and integrating people back into society rather than heavily tilted towards punishment - as in the long run that will be better for us all. 

However, there does need to be accountability. For every abused person in jail, there are many more abused people who avoid committing crime. I don't think telling them that it's okay, it's not their fault and that they can blame others for their situation is going to do them any favours at all; people can only function in society when they take responsibility for their own choices.

I also dislike the way this has been gendered - there's absolutely no need for it (men can be abused just as much as women) and Vicky Pryce just comes across as a vindictive misandrist to be honest.

Also, I'd like to share one of my favourite (true!) stories...

Many moons ago I was on a train going from York to Bristol... I was very bored until we got to Peterbrough station and this... how to say? 'rough' looking woman got on bored and sat in the same four-seat block I was in. I ignored her (like you do..) but when the drinks trolly came round she purchased a number of beers and offered one to me saying 'I'm celebrating... will you join me?'. It was about 11 in the morning, but seeing as I was on my eventual way to Glastonbury, I didn't refuse. So we drank her beer and got talking... turned out she had been released from prison that morning, had been given a few hundred quid (from which she'd got her ticket and beer) and was on her way back home. She was in such a good mood it was a really nice conversation, right up until the point I was drunk enough to ask her what she had been in for.... ""oh"" she said, ""I burnt a bloke's dick off with an iron... yeah, I thought he was a pedophile... turns out I was wrong but fuck him anyway right!?""

Which FTR is exactly the opposite of how I'd always thought they'd be. I though they were supposed to have this polite humble culture. Nope, not a chance. They're the polar opposite. 

One story, I was running this Chinese night in the venue ( I refused to work them after a few of these nights. )

Anyway, they'd brought in over a thousand Bento boxes for everyone to sample. Now traditionally if you've been running around all day for the organisers making sure they had the perfect evening you also get to eat with them. It's also written into the contract that this happens if they're supplying catering for the evening. 

So, as I hadn't been able to get out of the venue all day to eat I grabbed one of these Bento boxes and started eating it on the go.  This Chinese girl literally grabbed it out of my hand, shouted ""NOT FOR YOU!!"" smashed it on the floor in front of me then jumped on it. 

I was like, what the fuck? 

Then she started talking down at me like an animal: Do this NOW, do that NOW, you MUST do it this way, this has NOT been done. All FTR stuff the organisers were supposed to take care of, not me. I was there basically for any technical problems. 

The last straw came at about 7pm and I'd had enough. I just looked at her, smiled and said: You know what love, fuck you. And fuck your attitude. 

I told one of the security I'd be on radio after that and disappeared into my office for the night. To read a book. 

I have a load more of these stories from working there too, this wasn't an isolated incident.

Can you describe what you mean, by ""on average""?

By average, do you mean different pay for same job?
Or do you mean, all pay men make in the whole UK vs all pay women make in the whole UK?

The difference isn't discrimination, it's choice. We're both from Scotland, right? I work in the oil industry. It's 99% men. There are incentives there for women, but the overwhelming reason women do not go into it is because of choice. They don't want to work the long hours (12 hour shifts, 6am - 6pm) 14 days in a row with no days off. They see flying to an offshore platform as a risk they are unwilling to take. They don't want to sacrifice their social life. 

Overall, men work in industries which pay more and they make sacrifices for it. Women choose to have families and that means they have to work part-time jobs to be flexible. Most part time jobs are minimum wage. More men choose to work overtime than women too. If you extrapolate that for the whole country, you can see men *on average* being paid more.

It's choice, not discrimination.

I am merely saying its not that much more unsafe than plenty of the road systems we put in place for cyclists.  I mean look at this: http://goo.gl/maps/623pV  That pavement is a shared cyclepath.  Look at how that junction has been designed.  People will be doing 60mph on that road (often more, because it is so straight people speed n all that).  You basically have quite a few points that if you follow the path, can not be seen by cars at different stages of using that junction.

I find it best to ignore the cycle path and use the road for that reason.  However some motorists have the attitude that if there is a path nearby, you should be on it.  Even if its overgrown, has pedestrians who appear to not know its a cycle path.  If you do say 24mph, which is what I am for on the flat on a trek like that, it is rather dangerous.

On the whole I prefer using dual carriageways, but as both a driver and a cyclist, I know full well that junctions are a real death trap.  Compare this with the continent, and not, not Netherlands, that's too easy: http://goo.gl/maps/Vg3Rw  But Belgium.  Look how the cycle provision is in an area which has fewer people turning across it (by being in the middle), where junctions are required they are not made perpendicular by angled so visibility is almost guaranteed.

Interesting that you should say that as I do know the difference between fractions and decimals. Obviously you can't measure something like 1/3 or 1/7 using decimals with the exact same *theoretical* accuracy. 

But what accuracy do you need? If a pint is a pint, then anything else isn't a pint - if you're going to argue about accuracy.

If modern pint glasses are calibrated with metric equipment, where is your pint?

Interestingly a pint is standardised to ~~473.176473mL~~  568.261485mL (exactly, for UK pint). So, technically, it is possible draw an exact pint using metric equipment but I highly doubt a pint glass manufacturer is able to achieve such accuracy.

The pint is no longer a pint.

I think you step into dangerous territory when you talk about women provoking violence against them, as you'd need to be very clear in what circumstances provoked violence is justified, excused or even mitigated.  Under the last government, we moved away from the French idea of ""la crime passionnel"", and made changes in the law on provocation to exclude sexual infidelity.  More recently, the judiciary have arguably sought [to sneak the defence back in again](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/cases/R-v-Clinton-2012.php) (case details so possibly NSFW/L), and have been [criticised for this](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2061558).  It's also now possible for people to claim loss of control without it having to be sudden, which was argued to be important for women in ongoing domestic violence scenarios where they acted violently when their partner was incapacitated.

I'm not sure entirely where I stand on all this, because there clearly are cases on both sides where men who kill women in circumstances where they are utterly humiliated, or women who kill  sleeping or drunk abusers who have been vicious to them over extended periods and of whom they are terrified and who they are terrified to leave, which scream provocation/loss of control and most people can feel genuine sympathy.  However, there are other extremes where men kill women who leave them as a form of pathological jealousy/control or with a dog-in-the-manager sense of if I can't have her no one will, or women take cold revenge on men who have slighted them in some way and claim loss of control with a very ambiguous and sketchy history of abuse, or where abuse has been mutual and there doesn't appear to be much in the way of fear.

My father is a politocal assylum seeker and we have been involved in much that verifies the attitude that I hold. Have you ever had people claiming to be from a group associated with the government come to your home and make threats against everyone's well being? 

Im not some conspiritard, im describing what has happenned. You see, for a lot of the population things seem different too. Many citizens have not had the same positive view of the country as you due to their experiences.  

The internet sites are universal and have shown up on banned domains in a few other countries too. Not all. But you dont care. I know that. 

But evidence is a political tool thrown around these days. Do they actually have concrete evidence asaad gassed his own people?  Do they have evidence that as many people are killed in a war etc? Just because it comes from a government or news channel doesnt make it true. So why dont you go and source check bbc news? Why? Because they make claims without any of the actual evidence on show for you.

Im not trying to be high and mighty. Im trying to suggest that maybe people should be apprehensive about what they hear. Be it from me, uk government or AP. 

But none of this changes the fact that you disnt understand what algorithmic filtering is.  It is the use of scripts to basically tailor someone's online viewing experience through selective processes carried out by a machine.

A lot of major developments that have defined key aspects of the current game industry are because of Liverpool/Merseyside and most notably Psygnosis.

Manic Miner on the Spectrum was written in the building in which I now live on Old Hall Street. Birkenhead was home to Odin and Thor Software (who even released a game called Stairways, based on the now-closed rock club of the same name). Mike Singleton, who wrote Lords of Midnight and many other pioneering games was from Wallasey.

From the ashes of Imagine rose Psygnosis (where I worked for 7 years). We got bought by Sony to be part of the launch of the original Playstation. As a publisher, we were responsible for the support and development of many small developers that became large studios. Bizarre Creations (F1 series, Project Gotham, Blur), Reflections (Driver), DMA Design (Lemmings through to GTA5), Traveller's Tales (Lego stuff). We internally were responsible for Wipeout, Destruction Derby, Colony Wars and many other successful games and franchises. The Psygnosis office in the U.S. became the main office for Sony Computer Entertainment America. Ian Hetherington, who was one of the founders, went on to be a founder of Evolution Studios in Warrington (WRC Rally and Motorstorm series) and Realtime Worlds (creators of massive failure APB).

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"I live in the lower half of Queens park ( you could have said a few years ago on the wrong side of the tracks )  I'm seeing the area become more gentrified by the day. A couple of years ago the house I live in ( split into three large flats ) was occupied by a Jamaican Rasta musician ( renting ) who became a good friend and a chavy girl with two kids ( also renting ) on the bottom floor. 

The landlady recently sold these two flats for over £1/2 mill each and forced out the renting tenants. The Rasta guy was gutted, I totally miss having him around.  We now have a couple who work in the City on the middle floor and a guy who works in advertising as a creative director on the bottom. Personally I don't like these people, they're dull. I especially don't like their dull, hoity toity, pretentious friends either. 

The whole street is changing too, you can tell by the cars parked outside ( this street now has its fair share of BMW's, Mercs and the odd Ferrari )  and also be the sheer amount of building work going on.


Also the whole area around us is being gentrified too and it's spreading up to Kilburn and Kensal Rise. The area back down towards Notting Hill went a long time ago, the prices there are now astronomical. 

I'm just lucky that the girl and I own this place ( she bought it in the 90's )  there's no way we'd be able to afford the rents around here any more. You're basically fucked if you want to buy here now and you don't come from money. 

London is definitely changing, you have this inner core of serious money and everything else is being pushed outwards. 

What I can't work out though is where the hell all this money is coming from? I mean we're being told we're in a recession and a time of austerity.

This has been further pressured by the Integrated Transformation Fund (ITF) drawing out another £4 billion of NHS funding and transferring it to local authority control under the Health and Wellbeing Boards.  See http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/180713-item12.pdf.

It's widely recognised that the ITF monies are a bung to make up for the cuts to social services that local authorities have had to implement.  Those cuts have consequently impacted on the whole Acute service by an increase in delayed discharges from the acute/mental health setting due to no social care package being available in a timely manner.  No social care package means the patients stay on the ward, blocking further admissions and 'backing up' the system all the way through to the A&amp;E door.  See http://www.socialcareworker.co/2013/08/15/reaction-to-integration-transformation-fund-guidance/.  Those delayed discharges were the main driver behind the issues earlier this summer regarding A&amp;E performance and are expected to severely impact this winter during the already high activity winter pressures period.

As such, we are already upping the money we transfer to social care to try and prop that system up - the ITF will just be another hit to the funds available to the local NHS.  It's all cumulative - we don't get increases in total health budgets in line with inflation, we have ever increasing pressures on the amount of savings we have to make, we need to throw money at non NHS systems to keep them running safely and to mitigate their impact on the NHS and now we're facing an overhaul of the way the whole NHS is funded starting in 2014/15.  It's death by a thousand paper cuts.

Following Andrew Lansleys policy to change the way the regional NHS is funded from a historical formula based on public health data supported deprivation, physical and mental health need and age, it was suggested to switch to an entirely age based formula this financial year.  Luckily this did not happen, as the impact across the country would have been huge.  See http://careers.bmj.com/careers/advice/view-article.html?id=20014083.  However, it has just been announced (uh, internally at least) that this new Lansley formula will be in place for 2014/15 onwards, resulting in huge cuts (we're talking 20% swings) away from inner city and northern towns and increases to areas with an older population (which just happen to be core conservative areas).

Our hope at the moment is that it's staggered over some years to allow us all to adjust - at a cross London meeting recently, it was stated that if this was implemented at once, we'd need to close every 3rd London Ambulance Service (LAS) station immediately (at a time when LAS is already approaching the dangerously understaffed level and is under measures via the Care Quality Commission).  The largest London hospitals would need to either severely cut their services or close - and there's little to no chance that any would still be able to afford their expensive PFI premises anymore.  Camden specifically were looking at a £80m local cut to their budget, which would mean they would need to stop all services at UCLH, probably closing the hospital.",0,1381753641,null,0,false,0,ccre03x,t3_1ocv5u,t1_ccre03x,t1_ccqwjm6,null,1429136803,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,gusset25,welsh,Wales,"i've been a government lawyer who has advised on employment law in situations such as this.

in my opinion, the employee could have expected an informal warning or a written warning, probably not a final written warning. this wasn't a case of resigning or facing the sack. it was probably a case of the employee thinking ""fuck this, it's all gone a bit silly. i want out of this rubbish part-time job if they're going to be dicks about it"".

from the HR point of view, if it was a parent complaint, as some have speculated, HR tend to take it more seriously. I say HR, they tend to give the final say to the managers on the ground (in the offices) as long as the outcome isn't so severe that HR think they'd lose a tribunal claim.

It may not have been a parent complaint; managers do drive-rounds and occasionally managers and HR staff see things as they drive to the shops and so on.

As to the rights and wrongs of the case, lawyers (who advise HR, who advise managers, who sack lollipop people) tend to be risk-averse. HR tend to create long policies, because it makes them feel indispensable and because there's a feeling that in a tribunal situation it helps if you can show a judge that you regarded a behaviour as unacceptable, as if he's unable to exercise common sense. 

Where there is an issue of safety to service-users, everyone tends to over-react, because of the risk of press criticism sometimes forgetting, as here, the opposite possibility - that of press ridicule.

Managers themselves feel reluctant to turn a blind eye to safety issues, in case they themselves are disciplined for doing so.

Once there is a 'safety issue', it's like saying paedophile', in that no-one asks 'really? is this a real risk or a theoretical one?' and the disciplinary train cranks into gear by knee-jerk reaction.

And from my point of view, the lawyer's thinking that if his attention was elsewhere and there were to be an accident, then all the relevant facts will come out and be raked over at court and there would be a needless dispute, the truth of which would be impossible to get at, with thepossibility that the council would have to accept a few grand's worth of contribution to a personal injury claim and deal with the attendant legal fees. if you apply a cost-benefit analysis to that, even though the cost (risk) is small and the outcome medium, it is cost-free to avoid it, by asking the employee to stop doing it.

if advising the council's HR team, my own approach would have been to tell HR to get the manager to stop the practice and to circulate a message to other lollipop people in case it was more widespread. if i were the decision-maker at the council, i'd let the practice continue.",0,1381753999,null,0,false,0,ccre2f6,t3_1oeyfl,t1_ccre2f6,t3_1oeyfl,null,1429136769,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

You aren't too intelligent if this a point you are trying to make.

In fact I made it easy for you by expanding on that  just a few words later:

&gt;have to compete with the private sector they must pay market rates to their top execs to ensure they can a) attract these guys to the job and b) keep them there long enough to make a difference.

Which is to say, if they don't pay market rates then they don't get the top executives which have the experience and ability to actually do these jobs. It's quite simple.

&gt;Is it not the case that top salaries simply attract the greedy rather than the competent?

I warn you, there is an intimidating learning curve when getting into the jargon of these things, it makes much more sense when you hold one in your hands and can see how it works. DON'T BE PUT OFF. The community is one of the best things about vaping, ask questions and people will be nice. 

Throat hit is funny, it really depends which e-liquid (the stuff that goes in the chamber, produces the vapour which carries the flavour). Some have hits as strong as ciggies and some don't. 

Flavour-wise, there are countless e-liquids. You couldn't vape them all if you tried. I've had 6 bottles thus far. Three non-tobacco flavours and three tobacco flavours. Of the non-tobacco I really liked [Hadouken by Fuzion](http://innovapours.co.uk/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=27&amp;product_id=109) which was like having a really nice smooth menthol hit. Lovely. 

I will say now that tobacco flavours aren't like the real thing, but you can get some lovely ones. I really love Grizwalds' Old Holby, which seems to have actual Holborn tobacco as a flavouring. 

 there are some physical shops which specialize in vaping, if you're in London, I can advise you on where to go and you can go in and try it out, BUT they often have poor quality liquids with a heavy markup. Be a discerning buyer. 

One other note - health. There are no long term studies on the effects of these things. I *choose* to take the view it's more healthy than smoking but there may be other health issues associated. Do not blindly follow people that say ""it's only water vapour"" or that ""it can't be bad for you for the following poorly researched reasons"".

This is getting farther from 1, not closer. It's not fractions we are discussing it's averages, if an average is always increasing it must either reach it's limit or infinity if there is no limit. Even in your example where you keep halving the previous fraction, it would eventually have to reach a fraction where you couldn't fit all the numbers on to the page, and onwards to an infinite number.

Edit:I misread your comment, I thought it was a list of fractions you were showing.

It protects but also limits their right to keep and bear arms:

A ""militia"" in the lingo of the period meant ""every able bodied man."" So a modern day translation of the 2nd is:   

&gt; ""For the security of a free state, the right to keep and bear firearms shall be regulated but not infringed.""   

I always enjoy how 1/3 of Americans seem to completely ignore the ""well regulated"" part of their own constitution. The whole sentence doesn't even make sense if you think the word ""militia"" means ""a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army in an emergency"" as per our current usage of the word.     

The supreme court have said on multiple occasions that the US government have the right to regulate but not infringe on gun ownership (otherwise the USG would have no legal authority to stop anyone buying guns, even criminals).    

That's all anyone can ask for really, keep guns available but regulate the fuck out of them. Waiting periods, background checks, mental health checks, justifications for larger magazines and more powerful weapons. It is right there in the constitution.

As long as more hours means some more money they will work those hours. Unless tax reaches 100% with is obviously ridiculous. 

Even a fair playing-field will give rise to income disparity, that is right and proper.

There should be a gap, but it should be smaller.

For sure, environmentalism and wildlife preservation are very new to this part of the world, and don't have a strong purchase at an individual level, though it's improving.  Up until fairly recently, most people were much more concerned with the basics of living and didn't have much spare psychic energy for caring for the planet.  Animals either worked (ratting, guarding, laying eggs etc.) or were for eating. The whole Chinese medicine thing is unfortunately very strong too, though there have been moves to protect endangered species and start addressing issues of cruelty like bear liver bile for medicine when there are perfectly good alternatives.

&gt;I don't consider tours like that to be good value.

They can certainly have a sting in the tail.

&gt;It's cheap, yes, and it's technically a holiday, but you're being led around on a leash rather than being able to experience the country for yourself.

As I say, there are ways round this, and I've done it myself when it looked like good value.  I took a tour to Cuba and cut the tour dead as soon as we'd been transferred to the hotel.  They invited us to a couple of things, but once we'd fallen off the radar, they basically left us alone, and we got a 10 day holiday in Cuba with flights and accommodation for a hundred and odd quid!  When I've been 100% independent, it's frankly impossible to do it so cheaply, even if you use every trick you can.  You can also let the tour group bit take care of the obvious ""sights"" much more efficiently without headaches and then do your own thing.

&gt;If I was Chinese I'd rather pop over to South Korea if I was going to be stuck shopping than fly all the way to Australia.

This article and the comments from the NHS Confederation are more about the type of commissioning and health need that the NHS needs to re-define. 
The Independent’s title is **inaccurate**. 

Considering most of the article is based on content from the NHS Confederation and the 2015 Challenge; the Confed’s quoted comments are about change of commissioning behaviours that the NHS currently operates on.

The health need from the 1960s to now has changed significantly, and I think we can all accept in, general, that people are living longer. As we are living longer there is also an increase in the incidence of long term conditions (LTCs), of which the treatment is costly and puts high demand on the available clinical resources. 

A key point that the NHS Confederation makes is that often much of the NHS budget is spent on hospital care (acute trusts) which provide care such as acute illness and injuries. If the health need is changing (to one that needs to address LTCs), then the NHS should be focusing on the new demand this rather than older hospital based care. 

To give a very rough guide on financial figures, the clinical commissioning group (CCG - the organisation that has responsibility for some of the NHS purse for their little geography of England) has an annual budget £100M. Less than 1% of the budget will be spent on care in a primary care setting (i.e. GPs, Dental, Pharmacy, Optoms). 70-80% will be spent on hospital care, and the rest on prescribing, CHC (Continuing Health Care), and lots of other service areas. 

From the model most of the spending is weighted towards hospital care; the NHS Confederation highlights that this needs to change such that in our model we see greater spending in community providers i.e. GPs, Dental, Pharmacy, Optoms, CHC and joint agreements with organisations such as the local councils (local authorities). 

By funding more care in the community the NHS will be better suited to tackle LTCs and be able to treat for lesser costs compared to treating in a hospital. 

The idea of putting more care (more funds) towards the community is not new. There is currently a widescale consultation going on to figure out how care in the community can be delivered better - [NHS England: A call to action](http://www.england.nhs.uk/2013/07/11/call-to-action). 

I’m more annoyed by the paper putting a misleading title on this.

So what they do is they pretend that they are investigating fraud. They've got no fucking chance of proving fraud in court and in all likelihood the CPS will not proceed on that basis and will offer a downgrade to copyright infringement and a fine if the victim rolls over or dropping the case if they don't.

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"&gt; Next time you're in a pub, try ordering 568ml of beer. See what response you get.

You'd look stupid doing this because it's called ""a pint"", and when I'm in NSW, Australia, I will order a ""schooner"" of beer and not a 375mL of beer.

Not once did I suggest that you should stop calling it a pint, neither did anyone else.

You don't seem to be able to grasp the concept that there is a difference between the *name* of something versus the *measurement* of something. 

You spend pounds, right? Where do you think the name originated? The pound (£) was a troy *pound* of silver coins. When you spend pounds, do you imagine silver being exchanged somewhere?

So a pint of beer is now measured in mL, and a pint of beer is not a unit of measurement. You don't order 1.2 pints of beer, or 0.9 of a pint of beer. You order a pint *glass* full of beer, or a half which is served in a ... half-pint *glass*.

Whether you think of them in pints is irrelevant because pints are no longer used to measure beer in this country. Beer is *served* in a pint glass. 

&gt; not some silly irrelevant metric measure.

Very telling.

true,symbiosychotic,null,null,"My thoughts:

Everything is as we expect it up until we get to Ten's extra regeneration.  This creates Meta-Ten and, as far as the process itself is concerned, has used a regeneration.  Nine directly states that the process had already begun and that he can't just turn it off, so it IS him using a regeneration.  What Ten specifically did was he disposed of the rest of the regeneration process after it healed his specific injuries by funneling the rest of it into his discarded hand.  If he had not done so, the rest of the process would have re-written his persona and body as we would expect it to without him being able to just ""turn it off"".  That was the whole point of finding a way to expel the rest of that energy.

1 -&gt; 2 (Regen 1)
2 -&gt; 3 (Regen 2 - This is debatable, but I don't think he's trying to be tricky with arguing this point, especially when every element of a regeneration as we know it did take place: personality change, drastic appearance change, etc, as well as continuing to identify himself as a new incarnation of ""the Doctor"")
3 -&gt; 4 (Regen 3)
4 - &gt; 5 (Regen 4)
5 -&gt; 6 (Regen 5)
6 -&gt; 7 (Regen 6)
7 -&gt; 8 (Regen 7)

9 -&gt; 10 (Regen 10)
10 beginning the regen process but casting it into his spare hand -&gt; (Regen 11)
10 -&gt; 11 (Regen 12)

There is some debate about possibly including one more incarnation in the older stuff as well that would bump those counts up, but here's what I think Moffat is trying to accomplish.

11 would have been the end of his regenerations as he believes himself to have.  This is why the storyline is so focused on ""killing the doctor"" and how he is looking for a way to escape it that isn't ""find a way to reduce the severity so that he can manage to regenerate"".  When he's dying from River's poison, he specifically throws out the suggestion of regenerating and the TARDIS informs him ""Regeneration has been disabled"".  We immediately assume this is something that the poison has caused but this was a pretty critically disabling situation.  This is a character that has survived one metric-f***load (tm) of radiation through regeneration as well as other very deadly situations, and yet his body's regeneration was shut down by poison?  Sure, it could be some ""super engineered specifically for the Doctor"" poison, but I think its more that River was sent to target that incarnation specifically due to not being able to regenerate, making it a weak point to target.

River solves this by giving him her regenerations, which we've all assumed, but it was subtly done WHEN he had none left, which we mostly hadn't worked into the situation.  If the poison interfered with the body's ability to regenerate, that would apply to her syphoning her regenerations to him (similar to Ten to the hand) as well; so it isn't that the poison prevents regenerating but that he's out of them, thus why her regeneration does work.  That's what was so important about the entire arc; that entire season was about giving him his next set of regenerations because he was out of them.

Furthermore, we now face where the Valeyard fits in and as someone mentioned, Meta-Ten makes a perfect Valeyard.  He already shows an inclination to darkness and the Valeyard specifically targeted the Doctor.  He wasn't just trying to steal regenerations from ""anyone"" but specifically the Doctor (which would fit into Ten's morality - he wasn't causing harm to anyone but himself but was trying to abuse yet another loophole similar to the hand situation).  Meta-Ten as the Valeyard would be doing this directly because he can not regenerate either (directly stated when he was leaving with Rose), which is what prompted the Valeyard to need to steal regenerations.  Storywise, he may (towards the end of that life span) feel its not fair and, like Ten tried multiple times, tries to find a way to continue living.  That is a personality trait Ten holds that the Valeyard shares.  Keep in mind that Ten also forms a bit of a bond with the Master in general which shows a sympathy that could allow Meta-Ten to further develop a relationship with the Master (who later introduces the Valeyard).

Usually when we think of the Valeyard, we assume either that he is a full focus incarnation (in which the show couldn't handle because we can't just focus on an evil Doctor for even one season, not to the length of time it would require) or that all of the Valeyard's adventures happened in some quick situation that only took about five minutes in the primary timeline.

If 11 is the final natural regeneration, Meta-Ten could fit the ""just before the final regeneration"" requirement that becomes the Valeyard.  Capaldi, the 12th Doctor, is going to be the first regeneration into a new set (though technically a few regenerations in due to River using a few).  Remember, ""New Mouth, New Rules"".  Its also possible that 12 inherets some characteristics typical to River as well, meaning New Rules could be loaded point: A new set of regeneration and understanding on where the Doctor goes from here, and him incorporating some more direct tendencies like River uses to handle situations while still playing in the rules of his Doctor identity.",0,1381760143,null,0,1381764481,0,ccrfgd0,t3_1odo1z,t1_ccrfgd0,t3_1odo1z,null,1429136122,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,amaurosisfugax,null,null,"Scotland can be a bit different from England when it comes to religion. For one the national church is Presbyterian (originally Calvinist) and rejected such evil things as bishops/complex ecclesiastical hierarchies that were preserved in the Anglican Church following the break with Rome.

Despite not having any seats in the Lords as the Anglican bishops, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland was the closest thing Scotland had to a Parliament on its own soil between 1707 and 1997, so had quite a significant social role in Scotland until fairly recently. From the outside of both faiths it has always seemed a bit less easygoing than the CofE.

The other aspect of Religion in Scotland is that in certain places (Glasgow and its environs) Sectarianism has been a significant problem and the proximity to Northern Ireland has meant that the Catholic/Protestant bad-blood that has coloured that country's political and cultural discourse was able to set root in Glasgow as well. That sort of ""what team do you support"" interest in religion or the reaction against it is probably the most common sort of religious discussion that I've come across. (Unless you go to the western isles, where some parts are still scandalised that they now have a ferry service on the sabbath)

I would like to add that things have got a lot better (or less visible) over the past couple of decades. The State-Funded Catholic Schools I went to had a prayer at weekly assembly, offered daily mass (no one went), and had Mass on Holy Week, Christmas, the Holidays of Obligation and the School Feast Day. The also had RC RE once/twice a week as opposed to the SQA Religious and Philosophical education. However, this was just part of the normal school year. Apart from that we were teenagers in the 2000s, doing all the usual partying and underage drinking etc. We all knew and hung about with friends who went to the non denominational schools, or non-catholics who went to our school.

So you'd not care to elaborate on the moral justification for a process by which only people who are attracted to high salaries are deemed capable of executing the duties of an executive role?

I'm genuinely not tying to be snide here, but you've not made a point beyond saying that because other people get paid lots, this person should be paid lots.

The way that such a situation has arisen is painfully obvious, but that's not the same as a moral justification. We've all heard the argument you're putting forward many times before, but it's not an argument based on any moral grounds.

If a person can claim a high salary for no reason other than 'because I want it, and I can get it' then that should be the reason put forward. I think trying to justify it on the basis of parity with others is, at best, dishonest from a moral perspective. At worst, it's a form of blackmail.

Inspectors make important policing decisions for beat cops every shift, they have people coming to them for advice on things that they or their sergeant aren't sure on, and are sometimes left in charge on their own of certain policing operations.

I love your optimism and I wish I could share it but a number of statistics stand in our way.

We're *only* seven matches into the season. The season is only, like, 18% complete. I'll wait until the end of the calendar year (which is when we'll have played exactly half of our fixtures) before I start even considering we could have a shot at the title.

Some quick points:

* Remember we've yet to face Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Spurs (which will be massive benchmark matches for us).

* I also took a quick look at the title winners over the last five season and it looks like it took an *average* of 86.8 points to win the title. The lowest amount of points it took to win the league was 80 points ('10/'11).

* So, say it only took an uncharacteristic 80 points to win the league, that means we need to add at least 19 points from our '12/'13 tally of 61 points. (I'm sure there's some trivia that says that this sort of points swing for clubs doesn't happen often).

* In the '11/'12 season, we scraped together 52 points. In '12/'13 we were +9 on points from the previous season. That means in this current season, we need to go *+19* on points (and a quick look at our previous seasons indicates that we've not come close to adding 19 points from the previous season).

* And +19 points is a hard task considering we've struggled to finish with at least 60 points, let alone 70 points, let alone 80 points.

To me, I'm trying a new thing where I'm not obsessing (as I normally do) about table position but instead I'm focusing on steady forward progress. Progress this season - in my opinion - is improving on the previous season and gain at least 70 points (which would be another +9 pt improvement). And then let the chips fall where they may and with the way this season is going, 70 points might be enough to grab that all-important Champions League spot (i.e. a prestigious competition to attract the top players and the money to pay them).

So, those are my thoughts. Again, I love your optimism but I think you need to temper your expectations a bit until we have a larger sample size to base our performance.

A title is always the ambition, of course, but I think one also has to be realistic too. And, ultimately, I think we mustn't get ahead of ourselves.

In an ""X-rated"" 0–0 draw in December 1997, eight players were booked and Leeds had two players – Gary Kelly and Alf-Inge Håland – sent off. Martin Lipton called the match ""a throwback to the worst excesses of the Revie era when the likes of Chopper Harris kicked lumps out of Johnny Giles and Co."" Another 0–0 draw in October 1998 resulted in 12 yellow cards and a red card for Chelsea's Frank Leboeuf. In a 2–0 Leeds win at Stamford Bridge in December 1999, Leeds' Lee Bowyer was booked a minute into the game and Leboeuf was again sent off. A bad tempered League Cup fourth round match in November 2001 – their first cup clash since 1970 – saw Chelsea win 2–0, with Eiður Guðjohnsen scoring a goal while Stephen McPhail was on the ground injured. Graeme Le Saux was later stretchered off after being hit in the face by Alan Smith.



The clubs have not met in the league since Leeds' relegation from the Premier League in the 2003–04 season. Their last meeting took place on 17 May 2004, with Chelsea winning 1–0. The animosity between the clubs has still been expressed in the hostility of Leeds fans to the club being taken over by former Chelsea owner and chairman Ken Bates, and to the appointment of former Chelsea captain Dennis Wise as manager in 2006, resulting in chants like ""Get the Chelsea out of Leeds."" Gus Poyet, another former Chelsea player who served as Wise's assistant at Leeds, later commented that ""The fans didn't want us there because of the rivalry with Chelsea.""



The two were drawn to play each other in the League Cup in December 2012 at Elland Road, which was the first competitive meeting between them in eight years. After a goal by Leeds striker Luciano Becchio which put the West Yorkshire side ahead in the first half, Chelsea responded by scoring five in the second half, with the final score being 5–1 to Chelsea. Due to police concerns over potential crowd trouble, Chelsea were only allocated 3000 tickets rather than the usual 5000. The match drew a gate of 33,816, Leeds' highest attendance for two years.

I honestly don't believe Man U is that talented.  I think that SAF was a brilliant coach and had them playing well above their talent level.  Do you really think there is a gulf in class between us and Man U?  I honestly don't see it.

My point was that they are indeed in transistion, but so are we.  Our starting line up at the beginning of last year was:

--------Reina--------

Kelly Skrtel Agger Johnson

------Lucas Allen

--------Gerrard

---Downing Borini Suarez

Subs: Cole, Carra, jones, Shelvey, Adam, Carroll, Henderson

Since then we have upgraded half our starting lineup and our subs are are better than some of our starters were.


And once again, I'm not saying I EXPECT to win the title, or that our team is as loaded as the teams that spent a billion dollars on their starting lineup.  I said I don't see any reason not believe that we can be competitive until it's proven that we aren't.

true,IBWT_UK_Btc_Exchange,null,null,"&gt;The first fully regulated Bitcoin exchange in the UK

Regulated with everything currently possible.

https://ibwt.co.uk/company/legal

Note: IBWT makes no claim as the '1st' UK exchange, as Intersango and Mtgox were 1st to the UK market.

By 'Unregulated' we define this as;


No registered company.

No registered address.

No business account.

No data protection act 1998 registration.

No tax registration.

No corporation tax registration.



An unregulated business not applying the law and regulations can unfortunately face closure at an instance notice (or relatively heavy tax as an individual).

By 'regulated' we take a view as 'Yes' to all of the above.

There's actually a few other things we're doing as 'icing on the cake' (meaning, not needed, but can be added) with regard to regulation, we'll be able to reveal these in the near future.

Of course if there is another 'regulated' exchange that existed before IWBT we would of course not refer to IBWT as the '1st' and will give credit where credit is due.

We do encourage other exchanges to grow and exist, and hope to provide a working example.

Just 1 Exchange in the UK Market would be a mistake, others are coming, of that we are sure.

*edit: Please note, that our definition of 'regulated' and 'unregulated' is of course open to interpretation (in that it should not be taken as legal or similar advice, and that each business/individual should make the necessary checks themselves to make sure they ARE operating within the law) and that no matter what one person (or organisation) says there will always be a differing opinion.*",0,1381767967,null,0,1381768630,0,ccri39a,t3_1offj5,t1_ccri39a,t1_ccrhont,null,1429134833,2,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,2

true,basilthegay,null,null,"This came up in a thread the other day so I will repeat what I said there. Imagine this, we build a small stadium (5/6k seater) in the city and use it for B, U21 and maybe U18 games if the pitch can take it, maybe we could have the stadium/B team as some kind of self sustaining fan ownership situation. Lets look at the benefits;

* Fans - People who are priced out of Anfield can now afford to go to a game, students, pensioners, unemployed, kids etc. Plus if we could have fan ownership if the worst ever happened (god forbid) and we had something akin to another G+H situation we would at least have something if the worst happened.

* Players - Well obviously the younger players now get a level in between U21 and first team to help them bridge the currently considerable gap between those levels.

* LFC - Gets it's players not ready for first team more thoroughly prepared and even the players who will never make first team get to show there talents at a level they may end up playing at.

* Lower league clubs - League 2 clubs average 4ish thousand home attendance we could beat that easily for a B side, even we take zero away support ,which I would doubt, a competitive game against a Liverpool B or Man Utd B would be a big game for them and would drive home attendance figures for those fixtures. It would make those leagues more competitive and more keenly watched by fans of big clubs who currently know virtually nothing about what happens down there. Also we aren't talking about an extra 20 or 30 league teams here we are talking 4 or 5 maximum, probably not even that.

* City - Gets a an extra few thousand visitors every week and gets to add another potentially lucrative stop on the tourist trail.

For example, I know lots of people who have an opinion on Europe which they have formed from their  upbringing and the media. But of those people who have opinions on Europe, how many have looked, and I mean really looked, at different economic projections for the consequences of withdrawing from the EU. Not many. It seems unwise to make such a decision based upon ideology.

My solution, is not a ideal solution, but it seems to me the solution that minimises the probability of making a decision that leads to a worse outcome for the country as a whole. I would suggest to hire at random 50 of the UK's top economists working in either the academic, private and public sectors, let each of them calculate the losses and gains from following a particular course of action (say, increasing the level of wealth redistribution), take an average of these losses and gains, and make the decision based upon these averages.

An alternative would be to show the average of these calculations to 100 citizens drawn at random, ( selected such that each citizen can demonstrate the mathematical knowledge to understand the numbers and graphs) and let them vote on it after they have seen the numbers.

I have to say I do feel it's a shame, there are several things I do read from you guys that seems to be slightly shrowded behind a bit of secrecy.  You do say you want to be transparent, and encourage competition.  But for example, I did ask Jobe what bank you guys used as you've described them as welcoming and open to your venture.  The response was that I could find out for myself.  I think it would benefit everyone if there was a bit more transparency (and I try to practise what I preach as far as possible myself of course!) as I can't think of a reason why you guys couldn't just tell me and save me some time.

""A hospital trust is said to require ‘special measures’ on quality grounds when serious and systemic failings in relation to quality of care have been identified, and the persons responsible for leading and managing the trust are unable to resolve the problems without intensive support.""

Here is a BBC article briefly summarising the problems at each hospital that details why 11 of them needed special measures, the reasons cited include:

* culture of suboptimal care
* inadequate staffing
* lack of governance
* never events
* poor OOH care
* one hospital which had to immediately close two of it's operating theatres
* etc...

I think he's an undeniably class player. His time in Spain proves this. But he might have been the *wrong* player to buy given our team's complete inability to cross a ball and the fact that our opposition *always* sit very deep. 

As for the Hernandez rumors...I hope they're crap. He's not a bad player, but he has even more limitations than Soldado. 

/r/soccer is composed of many people who don't know shit about any league outside England and tend to overrate Hernandez (and GDS for that matter) so I'm not surprised to see all the comments about Soldado apparently being shit and Hernandez being top class. 

You also have to remember that fans of any other team are just dying to jump on your back about signings not immediately paying off because it rationalizes things and makes them feel good. Many of our fans were doing the exact same thing when Giroud was struggling for patches last season. Hell, many of our fans have already branded Willian a waste of money as well. 

It takes longer than 7 games to judge any signing. Giroud is a good example of a striker taking some time to get acclimated to the league, and Soldado's style of play is even more difficult for teammates to adapt to so I'm not really surprised he hasn't lit it up just yet. 

On the flip side you've seen players like Jelavic and Cisse hailed as genius signings only for them to eventually show the full picture after an initial burst of quality. The ability of a player tends to shine through in the end so I do have faith that Soldado will work out at some point.

Ah, it becomes clear. One of our American cousins has popped in for a visit.

&gt;I just said that pointing out the double standard in the article was not a victim complex as you seemed to be implying

Let's start from the *very* beginning. Let us define Double Standard:

&gt;A double standard is the application of different sets of principles for similar situations

So in this context the Dr, the Professor or the newspaper author, whichever one it becomes expedient for you to blame at any given moment, would have to have hinted that the failure of white boys was in some way a genetic trait. 

The double standard would be the part where ""If it was a discussion on ethnic minority or female students, I highly doubt the inferior genetics arguement would have been allowed"" *is* allowed for white boys. So let us find the bit where indeed the inferior genes of white boys were discussed.

[This is the article in question.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10200429/GCSE-results-influenced-by-childrens-genes-not-teaching.html) Again, and I've stated this many times, nowhere does the race of the students being examined come up. This is a general study of the aptitude of students in Britain, white, black Asian and anything else in between. At no point are actual genetics even looked at! They simply looked at exam results. They presumably compared those against the results of parents. They even compared twins to find a link between genes in a loose way.

So, in summation **A** study was done. It presumably involved ""ethnic minority or female students"" as well as white boys. This was referenced by the author of the article but in no way did he propose it as the reason for white boys failing, as that data simply doesn't exist. But, regardless _momoney decided to have a moan about double standards, that somehow weak genetics were being blamed rather than another study showing that other factors not related to school performance are being looked at by the DfE and you agreed. 

Whine and moan all you want you're stretching to create a narrative where you can be the victim. That's a victim complex my friend.

The only reason I did subs/reserves was because honestly I couldn't fit all the players capable of playing in our starting lineup/subs.  I know that asking a team to improve by 20 points is a large ask, but we aren't the same team either.  Our lineup is lightyears better than it was at the beginning of last year.  If we had the same team and were counting on players maturing ect, I'd agree that +19 is a large ask.  But we are much deeper and more talented than we have been in the past 3 seasons, and when you add our younger players maturing on top of that we have a much more solid team.  I do think we need to shore up two positions to have a realistic chance at winning the league, but seriously, when was the last time you could think ""we are only 2 or 3 players away?""  And with a bit of luck, I think this team is talented enough.

true,Falc7,null,null,"Yes I am happy that the gap is widening, but not because I am heartless. In recent decades, a large amount of poor, unskilled countries have opened up to the world, think China, India ect. Put simply, this dramatically increases the supply of unskilled labour in the world's marketplace. This increased supply of unskilled labour decreases the price (wage) of unskilled labour that existed in the world's equilibrium before China and India ect joined the world's market place, while increasing the wages for unskilled labourers in China. So while in wealthy countries the poor get relatively poorer compared to the rich, it lifts millions of the world's poorest people out of poverty, so overall I am happy with the widening gap. Because I recognise the widening gap to be the result of 'natural forces', I do not feel anger or a sense of unjustness about it.

I also do not believe that large amounts of wealth redistribution is the way forward. Wealth redistribution works like carrying water between two desert towns with a leaky bucket, for every bucket you carry, you can give less than one bucket when you arrive at your destination. My personal preference would be to subsidise the ways in which poor people can help themselves. Make access to higher education and apprenticeships easy, especially for indemand skills. I think programs like the Open University are brilliant for this reason.   Overall I feel people don't realise just how great the set up in this country is, with free education until 18, and student loans for university, job seekers allowance, child benefit.

Now this might be controversial to you, depending on how left wing you are. But I don't think life should be easy on welfare. Welfare should provide just enough for the basics in life + a little bit more. But what should be available (and subsidised) is the opportunity for people to improve their own lives through training and education. Personally, I grew up on benefits, and it was a struggle, which is good, it should be.

&gt;Nearly all 'first time shareholders' profiting from the RM flotation should be cashing in their shares and putting the money to a sensible use (whether that's spending in their daily lives, or investing in investment funds), rather than holding the RM shares hoping for a rise in value and a few pounds of dividends if the staff don't strike too often. 

I honestly didn't have a long game plan for these shares (I bought them on a whim, which I know isn't a sound financial tactic!).  I absolutely wouldn't sell then rebuy Royal Mail to move them into an ISA, I agree.  Where do you think the Royal Mail stock is going to settle?  

&gt;Surely someone like you with only £2000 of other investments should be investing in a mix of funds, providing diversification into lots of underlying companies around the world, rather than trying to pick a UK mail business and hoping that will go up in value instead of down.

Is this the right approach?  I am trying to get into investing, and intend to put more money into it over the next few years.  In your opinion, should I be focusing on funds and not holding some individual stocks myself?

You can show them an amazing episode from later on in the series, but typically the reason that episode is amazing is because it relies on things you learn earlier or it reveals potential spoilers.

Blink is amazing not only because is it a great episode, but it is shown through the eyes of a one-off set of characters. They learn about the Doctor and his powers the same way a new viewer does -- confused and ripped out of their normal lives for an amazing ride. It gives new viewers a taste of what Doctor Who is all about -- science fiction with heart and humor -- that gives them the push they need to get through the first few episodes and become true Whovians without ruining the experience of the earlier story arcs.

You're going to have to explain how one is related to the other.

EDIT: 

I'll explain *my* point of view so you get where I'm coming from. First the above. The accusation was simply false...didn't happen. His worst fear, and one that many upvoted in agreement wasn't happening but he saw it as a valid complaint anyway. What would you call it? The top comment here before he deleted it realising it was too obvious as complete fantasy was the accusation that certain organisations were excluding white people from their events. Again, the group was looking for evidence where white males in particular could all join in and lament the hard lives they lead. The fact neither of the two events even took place didn't stop the massive pity party that ensued.

Now contrast this with the two posts right now on the front page relating to black people being denied flats by estate agents.

The first few comments were quick to find excuses, before swiftly moving on after people actually bothered to read the article and watch the video, to simply blaming Asians for being racist against black people, swiftly moving on to blaming all minority groups for being the most vile racists.

So in summation, white people are apparently the most downtrodden and disenfranchised group in Britain, all while being near incapable of racism themselves all while suffering from the vile racism of ethnic minorities.

It happened almost by accident, I'd always like a few British shows/movies but once the constant stream of US rebroadcasts was gone (along with my cable subscription) and I had to start seeking out good shows to watch I just kind of gravitated away from the familiar. Short, tight series with defined beginnings, middles, and ends, and one off 2 part mini-series trump drawn out repetitive seasons anyday.

There are times where I won't understand some cultural reference or lose a line to an accent but it doesn't really bother me. That said, I can see why those would be bigger problems with a broader audience. I'm talking about trying to take someone who watches Criminal Minds or CSI and give them Luther in it's place. Imagine trying to replace The Big Bang Theory with Peep Show - I suspect that it wouldn't work out.

I assume that most people on this side of the Atlantic who watch a lot of British TV are willing to overlook some small challenges because we know the reward is worth it. Someone who just wants to veg in front of the TV after work and shut their brain off might not be as willing.

On a related note, I surprise myself sometimes with how well I can understand different accents now. Most people here are used to only hearing ""posh"" (ie. Downton Abbey) British accents and I was watching Shameless with a friend of mine a while ago (he was getting into the US remake, I had been watching the original so I wanted him to watch a couple of the original episodes so he could see that it really was a 1:1 copy) and he was like ""I can't understand a word they're saying!"" and I wouldn't even consider it to be exceedingly accent-heavy.

One of my favourites was [Pandora's Box](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aki0-ElB6tQ&amp;feature=youtu.be). I suppose I liked the idea that just one woman could ruin *everything.*

I used to get a fortnightly magazine that came beautifully illustrated and with a tape, full of fairytales, as a kid. 

Some kind soul has put the [entire collection](http://storytellerwebsite.wordpress.com/the-collection/story-teller-1/) on a website, and uploaded not just the tapes but the lovely illustrations too.

Thanks a lot. That's a month of my life that I'll never get back because I now have to listen to the entire collection again! Ah, I must've ripped those tapes to pieces with listens, I recognise almost all of the story names and even the voices narrating them.

What a marvellous find. 

(all fairy tales are warped, listen to Pandora's husband slapping her and calling her stupid in the above link). 

Edit: I'm also currently watching a [TV series, probably written for adults](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843230/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) which mashes up a bunch of fairy tales to make a plot of its own.

true,quenishi,null,null,"&gt; When we viewed the flat three weeks ago, the lighting in the windowless stairwell was broken

If the upkeep of the communal areas is an issue for you, then count it as a mark against. Also estate agents can sometimes lie, so who knows if they actually said anything. Some people are insanely lazy over lightbulbs, but it might be worth trying to talk to current tenants to see if communal upkeep is an issue.

&gt; But the washerdryer machine is second hand

If you get any free stuff when buying a house, it's a bonus. It's highly unlikely you'd get any white goods in a house/flat sale, as the previous occupant has usually taken them with 'em. If you really don't want it, it might be worth asking the owner to get rid of it. My house was lived in by an elderly person who passed on, so I got a fair bit of furniture, but the owners wanted to sell the white goods, so I just bought my own (the prices they were selling at weren't good for 2ndhand). 

&gt; There's nowhere to put the bin bags

There should be somewhere. Even if it's a place that doesn't have wheelie bins, there should be *some* kind of bins outside (ah, the days before wheelie bins). I personally wouldn't settle for ""keep it in yer house"". 

&gt; there is no sprinkler system in the stairwell or the flats.

Stairwell might be classed as a fire-sterile area (i.e. nothing that can combust without a *lot* of persuasion), so wouldn't expect any there.  As someone else said, only time I've seen sprinkler systems is in offices, rather than flats, but fire-sterile areas don't need fire suppression. 

&gt; If there is going to be a keycode for the postman 

Possibly. I wouldn't trust them keycode doors anyway - people let other people through all the damn time, not to mention some end up prone to hawkin' over their code if it isn't regularly changed. Use your own front door as security. They stop random people wandering in and thickies, but if someone wants to get in, they will. 

&gt; plumbed into an outside vent. It isn't. 

Sounds pretty damn useless to me - never had a vent NOT vent from outside, for fairly obvious reasons. Could be an issue, especially depending on flat layout. Or you may have a window that suffices for ventilation. 

&gt; Gas and water metres are located in the basement

If it's just the meters, I wouldn't see it as a great issue, but I would definitely enquire about access to them, just in case you need it. You'll have a stopcock for the water in your flat no doubt, as well as one near the meter. 

&gt; So is being the only external permanent tenant a bad thing?

Nothing that I know of. Can't claim to have any expertise whatsoever on this one. Can't see it being an issue. ",0,1381776283,null,0,false,0,ccrl7uq,t3_1o5fiw,t1_ccrl7uq,t3_1o5fiw,null,1429133374,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

true,alchemeron,null,null,"&gt; I'm talking about trying to take someone who watches Criminal Minds or CSI and give them Luther in it's place. Imagine trying to replace The Big Bang Theory with Peep Show - I suspect that it wouldn't work out.

I'm not a fan of these ultra-broad comparisons.  It's more apt to compare these kinds of off-beat shows with off-beat American shows.  Always Sunny in Philadelphia, for instance.  Both sides of the pond have shows which cater to the lowest common denominator or to narrow/niche audiences... and even then: these terms mean different things due to some natural differences.  An American failure can draw more viewers than a British success.

When I was talking about accents, the intelligibility will naturally come with exposure, but there are cultural differences which are much easier to miss.  The very idea that an accent can be ""posh"" (as opposed to received pronunciation).  That's a cultural idea with class weight that exists in America in a very different way.  The closest thing is the mid-Atlantic accent, but that's really just been an increasingly-rare stage accent.  A southern accent is sometimes connected with a lack of education or being poor, but ""posh"" doesn't have an analogue.

Does Britain have a direct version of ""white trash""?  I don't really know.  I know that Australia has bogans, but it's an imperfect translation of a specific cultural idea.  Even watching Trailer Park Boys there were cultural elements (some exaggerated to juxtapose a comedic effect, I'm sure) that would remind me that the show and its characters were specifically Canadian.  Beyond the named locations and later plot, of course.

Those are the kinds of things which can trip up audiences and keep them from being fully immersed.  If it's one or two small things it's minor.  With every other detail you add, and this can include location or time period, that barrier becomes a little bit more intimidating to a new viewer.",0,1381777087,null,0,1381777595,0,ccrlion,t3_1oex7p,t1_ccrlion,t1_ccrk95p,null,1429133233,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

&gt;In the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe, population-based varicella immunization is not practiced. The rationale is that until the entire population could be immunized, adults who have previously contracted VZV would instead derive benefit from occasional exposure to VZV (from children), which serves as a booster to their immunity to the virus, and may reduce the risk of shingles later on in life. The UK Health Protection Agency states that, while the vaccine is licensed in the UK, there are no plans to introduce it into the routine childhood immunization scheme, although it may be offered to healthcare workers who have no immunity to VZV.

GM has been widely touted for decades as a product that would solve would hunger and increase yields drastically - it has done anything but.

The only thing it has achieved is making a small number of different crops resistant to chemicals pedalled by the same companies selling the seeds, and we are now seeing downfalls even with this approach. 

Golden rice provides a solution to a problem that needn't exist, most worryingly is ample amount of food available that provides the nutrients in the countries where this is a problem, and can be solved by simple education.   

The industry in its desperation has looked for a problem they can potentially assist with to make their industry look better when there are far easier alternatives to the problem. They could even be prolonging the problem by looking to develop a product when education and food alternatives are available now!

It's a long, arduous process which rules out buying them online. Their staff are quite friendly and can help you choose if you're getting stuck - when I've been they were no-nonsense honest and helpful with choosing, no pandering or eggshells.

I choose Specsavers because they're way cheaper than other places. I saw a nice pair in vision express for 150 quid, ended up getting 2 pairs in Specsavers for about 120, cos they always seem to have a 2 for 1 deal.

Regarding lenses though, you should totally get those online. I used a company called ciliary blue, who replaced the scratched lenses (prescription) in my sunglasses that I bought about 8 years ago, and fitted some lenses into my cycling glasses, for peanuts - something like 15 quid for the cycling glasses, and 25 for the tinted ones. So if you have old frames, you can send them in and get new lenses (you can pay a fiver for them to clean them up as well or something if I recall). You don't pay postage, they send you a little box and it took a couple of days tops.

Some highlights:

- The McCanns went directly against strong advice from Portuguese police NOT to publicise Madeleine's eye defect, as it would make her very easily identifiable and drastically increase the chances that her kidnapper would kill her. They even made it part of their awareness campaign. Surely any parent would have their abducted child survive her kidnapping in exchange for a possible delay in finding her.

- Two separate sniffer dogs that found traces of human cadaverine and blood in the apartment were dismissed by the McCanns. Why would they necessarily ignore the possibility that she had been killed in the hotel room?

- Neither of the 2 year old twins woke up after a man supposedly broke into the apartment. Allegations that the McCanns had sedated their children were met with swift and strong denial by their legal team, and they consequently refused to have the twins' blood tested.

- Gerry McCann spoke of future anniversary events to raise awareness only weeks after Madeleine had supposedly been abducted, implying he knew she wasn't coming back.

- There are serious, significant dicrepancies between almost all the 'Tapas 9' eyewitness accounts, including Gerry McCann not mentioning Jane Tanner walking past him when she allegedly saw the kidnapper.

I'm not a tinfoil hat conspiracist in any way, shape or form, but objectively there is something seriously strange about this whole thing.

The conversation I had went something like this:

Him: How is the American war of independence taught in British schools?

Me: It isn't. Britain has a lot of history to teach its children, and the war of independence isn't really a big deal to us, sorry.

Him: So not even AP kids study it?

Me: We don't have an AP programme.

*Downvotes*.

A few kind souls took time out of their day to inform me that Britain must not teach its children about wars it lost.

Oh now this is beginning to grind my gears. Not having a go at you as such, but it's NOT the teams lack of creativity, we have some amazingly creative players. It's simply a case of Soldado making the great runs he's always done, but as the team hasn't been playing together for long the rest of the team don't instinctively know where those runs are.

People don't seem to realize that to split most teams defenses you need to make the pass BEFORE the striker makes his run so the defense doesn't have time to react. This relies on the passer and the striker having an understanding on when and where that run is going to be made. That understanding takes time, especially when before this season half our starting line up had never played for the team before.

You guys need to stop and think about how much player turnover we've just had, and that these guys need to learn how each other play, where they like to make their runs etc.

It will come, but the team is far from ""gelled"" at the moment. Right now we're just relying on the fact we have some brilliant individual players. It probably won't be until after Xmas that we start to see the brilliant team start to show.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"How suprising.... the EU, the institution with the most to lose from percieved benefit tourism, commisions a study that totally debunks that it even exists. Convenient!

Personally I suspect true benefit tourism is pretty limited but never the less does exist (i.e. a ""Abdalwangie Nbzawayo"", a fictional french-via-algeria citizen comes to the UK purely for medical treatment for a longstanding medical issue). But I'm not sure the Torys have ever painted benefit tourism in isolation as a major issue - but rather that the strain that immigrants of **all** types (including economically active EU ones) put on the existing social infrastructure... and there is very little research looking at that because it is so difficult to pin down in numbers.

For example how much does ""Piotr Waschevski"", the polish economic migrant who works as a taxi driver strain the healthcare system?... On the one hand some studies argue that as an economically productive tax payer he is actually a net contributor... but other studies show that as a recipient of substandard medical and dental care in Poland he is more likely to exert greater costs on the NHS.

I would argue that as far as EU immigration goes the real issue boils down to two main things;

* Capital flight - i.e. migrants sending money earnt in the UK to countries outside the UK and the economic impact it has

* The cultural impact of large volumes of migrants (from any destination), particularly when localised into fairly small areas. Not without reason, older British residents find it intimidating when their street is replaced by foreign language speakers with different cultures and customs over the space of just ~5-10 years.

* Man with brown hair, carrying a blonde haired girl wearing clothes matching Maddie's?  In pissing distance of the apartment?  Really does sound like Gerry McCann and the e-fit even looks like him... do the times match up with Gerry being at the table eating?  If it *was* him, what was he doing?  That said, he's such a well known face I'd have thought the Irish witnesses would have recognised him later from the media and there wouldn't be the ambiguity we now have

* I reckon the guy with the sunglasses and the other bald guy in the e-fits might very well be the burglars that targeted the complex around the same time.  Probably just local scumbags taking advantage of tourists and my gut feeling says they weren't involved in Maddie's disappearance

Long story short, they opened up (and transferred me to) a regional office but couldn't attract anyone to work at it. At the same time, head office was short of staff so the people we did have ended up spending most of the time at HQ. I was put in the position where I wasn't allowed to make sales calls because we had no staff available, and even when we did get incoming calls asking us to carry out work we had to turn it down. 

Funnily enough the work the Regional guys were doing was being put against Head Office sales figures so technically my new office was being  made to look like it was losing money. As Sales Manager, I was deemed to be failing in my job so I got put on a gross misconduct rap. My last visit I had to HO, I was given a choice - get fired under that or resign. To be honest, I think they were looking at getting rid of me as a means of cutting costs. I looked it up and it made no difference in claiming benefits if I was fired for gross misconduct or if I resigned, so I took the option of resignation as it gave me a little more money and more free time to find a new job and at least I claim to prospective employers that I'd quit rather than get fired for being ""shit at my job.""

1) The eye defect publicising claim. Got a source for that outside of the conspiracy forums? Funny, I can't find a source from the police saying not to publicise the eye defect. Anyway, the defect is obvious when you see a photo of her. The idea that publicising it would 'drastically increase the chances that her kidnapper would kill her' is laughable.

2) Sniffer dogs finding 'traces of human cadaverine and blood in the apartment'. Ah yes, the dogs *brought in at the request of the McCanns*. Internet detectives always jump on this one, despite the fact that forensic tests were unable to corroborate the dog's find and that the police therefore dismissed it as a common false-positive. Still, I'm sure the conspiracy theorists with no direct access to the evidence know best eh?

3) 'Neither of the 2 year old twins woke up'. Hah. I've vacuumed outside the room of my sleeping 2 year old in the past.

4) 'Gerry McCann spoke of future anniversary event'. Grasping at straws and pretty pathetic. See [here](http://madeleinemythsexposed.pbworks.com/w/page/39078156/Rebuttal%20of%20%22Fact%22%2037) to see how massively out of context this is taking his comments.

5)Discrepancies in the witness accounts. Yes, as there always is.

&gt; I think Occam's Razor is needed here.

'The solution with the fewest assumptions'.

For the conspiracy to be right, Madeleine died violently (remember the blood) at the hands of her parents. The parents then hid her in the wardrobe in their room (then later moved the body to behind the sofa). They then went down for dinner with their friends. One of their friends must have been in on it as he went up to the room to check on the kids at one point. At 10pm they then raised the alarm (clearly hoping the police wouldn't find the body hidden in the wardrobe/sofa). They then waited 28 days until they had hired a new car and then moved the body.

The closest British equivalent is probably a combination of the Roman invasion of Britain, the Norman invasion in 1066 and the English Civil war (and more specifically the execution of King Charles I). Basically, unlike new-world nations most European nations can't really define their current political or cultural identities in a single historical event.

Why? Because using the UK as an example - most have gone through about a dozen such events over a period of ~2500 years...and students theoretically learn about these events on an arguably more objective basis than US or AUS students learn about their respective ""national moments"" because understanding the above explains why our nation works the way it does now - and is in many ways less emotionally charged;

* I.e. if you want to understand why the English language has evolved the way it has you need to understand that the people, culture and language of the British isles evolved away from the original franco-celtic settlers as a result of the Roman invasion, the roman withdrawl and the rise of the Anglo-saxon people, and again around 1000 years later by the Norman invasion

* If you want to understand why the UK has a two-house political system, you need to know about the execution of King Charles I in the 1650s and how it ended the devine right of kings to rule in Gods name. It established instead the system of constitutional monarchy that we still use today.

true,Boiiing,null,null,"&gt;  Do you have any recommendations for providers (beyond the list you gave)? 

I use [TD Direct Investing](http://www.tddirectinvesting.co.uk/choose-an-account/trading-isa/) as my broker for both a non-ISA shares account, and an ISA account which is mostly shares rather than funds. I also use Sippdeal (AJ Bell) for my SIPP which does the same sort of thing (except I happen to be using their pension wrapper rather than an ISA wrapper) with a different fee structure. 

If I was starting out today with an ISA I might use [Charles Stanley Direct](https://www.charles-stanley-direct.co.uk/Why_We_Are_Different/) who have a reasonable price for holding a mixture of funds and shares, until you have about £20k, when some other options might be cheaper (their annual fee is a (low) percentage of your total assets but obviously costs more the more you have). Look for percentage fees if you only have (relatively) few assets and fixed fees if you have lots of assets.

If all I was doing was buying shares and not funds, and I only wanted UK shares (like RM etc), the cheapest option in or outside an ISA wrapper is probably x-o.co.uk, an execution-only no frills broker. But as a newbie you should not be buying shares in individual companies that you really know relatively nothing about (see comment below).

There is a decent comparison of costs of different brokers at http://monevator.com/compare-uk-cheapest-online-brokers/ ; Monevator is a good site overall and although it caters a bit more to the 'passive' investor rather than someone who trades shares or buys actively managed funds, due to the personal philosophy of those that run the site, the people writing there are pretty smart. Lots to keep you reading.

&gt;I absolutely wouldn't sell then rebuy Royal Mail to move them into an ISA, I agree. Where do you think the Royal Mail stock is going to settle?

Exactly, if you had £1000 cash you would not buy RM shares now they have just spiked up 33+%. This tells you that if you have £1000 of RM shares you should not keep them. Where it settles is not relevant, you have just got gifted a free chunk of cash and that same day-one free gain is no longer available. If you want to gamble on it going up or down from here, you can, but you don't know what the odds are. So it is a game that mathematically you shouldn't bother playing. Sell the shares.

&gt;Going forward I think I'd like to have about a 70/30 split between funds and shares picked myself (to practice investing, or something like that).

&gt;Is this the right approach? I am trying to get into investing, and intend to put more money into it over the next few years. In your opinion, should I be focusing on funds and not holding some individual stocks myself? 

Yes to the focusing on funds. A fund is a way of deploying £1000 into 100 companies across multiple geographic markets without getting out of bed and buying £10 worth of each of the 100 companies and paying £10 broker fees to buy each of them and £10 to later sell each of them, requiring each company to triple in value for you to even break even. Why would you want to access multiple companies? Diversification - you don't know which company will perform well or go bust. Why would you want to access multiple markets (USA, UK, Korea, China, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, Brazil)? Diversification, you don't know which country will perfom well or badly compared to your own.

There are different choices in funds with different exposures to different types of companies around the world. There are different strategies - if you buy a UK index fund you effectively put most of your cash in the largest UK companies so that when it says on the news that 'the FTSE 100 went up by 4% last month', your portfolio also went up by 4% because you have 70 quid of your thousand quid in each of HSBC and Royal Dutch Shell oil, and 2 quid in each of William Hill and Tate &amp; Lyle, so your proportions mirror the index and overall your portfolio will move like 'the market'. Whether it is sensible to have over 30x the exposure to oil companies like Shell and BP than you have to sugar and milk companies like Tate or Dairy Crest, is another question entirely. But it is one option. Otherwise you can have an investment trust or a more 'actively managed' fund, where the management fees are higher but someone is making decisions to pursue a particular strategy to try to beat the market. 

Reddit loves passive investing using indexes because it is easy and for Americans it can be tax efficient compared to active managers buying and selling underlying companies all the time. On the main /r/PersonalFinance forum they would tell you to just buy Vanguard index funds (extremely low fees, basic index tracking). Vanguard have a product called 'Lifestrategy' funds which you can get in the UK through the brokers I mentioned above. It is one fund which is a mix of different international indexes so you are not just following UK (your local index) or US (the biggest international one, half the investible world). Blackrock do a similar fund family called 'Consensus'.

The best thing you can do starting out with 3k in your ISA and wanting to get into investing, is spend a couple of percent of it on some books. Sure, best way to learn is by mistakes so you could buy some individual stocks. If they go up you will think it is easy and will learn nothing. If they go down it is an expensive lesson. So go with books.

Standard book recommendation for a UK newbie is [Tim Hale's Smarter Investing](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Smarter-Investing-Simpler-Decisions-Financial/dp/0273785370) ;new edition out this month, old edition now half price on Kindle.

I have that book, he is a huge fan of index investing / passive investing which as mentioned is only one way of doing it. But it's standard issue for a new investor. 

A more balanced approach might be in Andy Bell's new book [DIY investor](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-DIY-Investor-Investments-Financially/dp/129200066X), he owns AJBell which runs Sippdeal, Money AM, Shares mag, and diyinvestor.co.uk. [Preview here](http://www.ajbell.co.uk/DownLoadfiles/diyinvestor_book_cBox.pdf) . I haven't read it but the guy seems smart enough and the preview looks like what you want (i saw a promo link because as mentioned, I use SIPPdeal as one of my brokers/platforms). If you can sell your RM shares at a nice price, you might have enough for a couple of books *and* £250 free profit.

Hope that helps get you started, enjoy. Just don't count on next £250 being as easy as the last ;-)

I'm a 6 foot, twelve and a bit stone 34 year old goth with shaved sides (who isn't brave or daft enough to post a picture on reddit, sorry about that!) and it's been fairly common for people I've met over the years to assume that I'm a dossy bastard. I deal with older, fairly conservative types pretty often for work and I think that most people assume that antiques dealers are going to be of the old boy, red trews and bow tie wearing type. That said, I'm always suited and booted for work and leave my mohawk down, and have only had a couple of problems caused by my look in fifteen years in the business. Both of those were with people who clearly had no intention of selling anyway, having watched too many TV programmes and assuming they could hoodwink someone in the trade. 

That all said, I do still find myself judging people on their looks or my first impressions of them. It's just as common for me to be buying from people who live in poor areas and look like they spend their lives in tracksuits and onesies as it is to be dining at manor houses with the estate owners (which doesn't happen *nearly* as much as I'd like!) I admit that I still have that kneejerk reaction of ""Oh fucking hell, here we go..."" pretty often but more often than not they're just nice people trying to get on with their lives, and I constantly check myself when I feel my hackles go up. 

I suppose I feel that I choose to look the way I do, so fully understand why some people may have an adverse reaction. I still occasionally get shit from drunks- I had a great one a couple of weeks ago when going to meet my girlfriend from the last train, where a group of shitfaced girls in their mid-20s regaled me with a chorus of *""PAL! YOU DRESS LIKE A HOBO! YOOOOU DRESS LIKE A HOOOBOOOO!""* as I was wandering past the pub they were stood outside but I can't say it bothers me- I actually giggled a bit once I was past them. 

That said, I do feel for the kids who are trying to find themselves and end up getting shit for how they dress. I've done some stuff for the [SOPHIE](http://www.sophielancasterfoundation.com/) campaign in the past and have no idea how I'd handle being a teenager in today's internet age. In the mid 90s I'd end up getting shit over my long hair or clothes and either leg it or or get in a fight, then that was pretty much that.

&gt;  When did it become cool to criticise Kate and Gerry McCann? 

When was it anything but? We live in a free country, in a society where it is entirely acceptable to be critical of another's behavior, particularly when that behavior entails leaving three young children on their own in an insecure foreign building.

You seem to think that the criticism leveled towards them is a new phenomena. It's been there since day one. 



&gt; I am of course referring to leaving their daughter Madeleine and her siblings alone in a hotel room while they spent the evening with friends. Not great parenting, sure, but hardly what I'd call abuse...


Well, no, because it's not abuse. It is, however, quite unquestionably extreme negligence.


&gt; I'm sure they regret the decision they made that day every single second of their lives, but here's the thing some people need to get into their heads- YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but it won't alter what's happened - it won't bring Maddie back!

And nor will the deification of the couple. 

&gt; It fucking sickens me how CRUEL some people can be - 6 years on and you STILL blame them? Like you've never made a mistake!?

Seriously? You think that because six years have past, we're supposed to stop blaming them? 

And, yes, everyone makes mistakes. We punish people for their mistakes all the time, particularly when those mistakes cause a serious impact. In the case of Kate and Gerry, their 'mistake' was that of sheer premeditated neglect which resulted in the possible death, or no-one knows what, of their daughter. 


&gt;  These are two BROKEN PEOPLE. They've been to HELL and back - cut them some slack and focus on supporting the investigation and catching the REAL criminals in the picture - THE PEOPLE WHO ABDUCTED MADELEINE!!!

How do you know she was abducted, and they weren't responsible in any way for her disappearance? It's a tragic event, but it needs to be fully investigated, and it hasn't been, because of the sheer pressure all authorities have been placed under by the media and politicians. Do you know the chief investigator published a book detailing why he believed the McCanns were absolutely guilty, which was subsequently banned from sale, while he was banned from making any claims of any kind that contradicted the version of events given by the McCanns?


&gt; And this is to all the mums and dads out there who seem to think it makes you a better parent by criticizing and slagging off Kate and Jerry McCann for a mistake they made six years ago - I hope YOUR children get abducted.

Jesus. You hope some innocent kid gets abducted because their parents harbour a completely harmless opinion? 

&gt; I hope the guilt consumes you. I hope it eats away at your soul piece by piece and tears you apart, and you lie awake at night unable to sleep, beating yourself up about it and thinking what you could have done differently to prevent it. Then, and only then will you TRULY know how it feels!

You're an imbecile.

Effectively we're paying this guy to put people who were in work into the unemployment system. So he's not saving us shit, he's just shuffling people around. Not really a genius move worthy of £170,000 a year.

I call bullshit. Safe hands don't exist. Being a crafty bastard and getting away with shit, now that's a different story. At the end of the day savings generally mean a cut to quality or to humanity.
