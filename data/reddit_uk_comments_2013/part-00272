2. The high line. Does anyone actually see a benefit from this system? Thought about it earlier today and the only positives are A. pressure and B. offside trap. The thing is, pressure doesnt work when the defensive line isnt covering each other. The offside trap doesnt work when the line isnt all on the same page, as we saw today with Naughton and Capoue. Lastly, shockingly obvious how necessary a pacey defender is to the high line. Saw a comment in another thread, ""Dawson or a high line. Pick one"" AVB might be just too rigid with his strategy. 

Let's have a positive outlook on this though. Levy, AVB, and staff ended up where they are through their merits and savvy in the footballing world. Lets hope that both make the right decision regarding the future of Tottenham Hotspur FC.

I am a big college Basketball fan in the US and this is like what happened last year to Kentucky. they won the National championship, the next year they couldn't even make it to the tournament. no one threw hissyfits because they new the team was being remodeled and that they would be better the next year. most of this team has been at WHL for less than 18 months! 18 months! the teams Redknapp had had been together for many years for the most part (a new addition here or there but not the same massive influx).  building a great team takes time, not over night.  the only teams that can build great over night at the teams that can spend 500mil on players.

The numbering doesn't matter, except for those lists that you and I have been making for many years. So I've given you the option of not counting John Hurt numerically - he's the War Doctor.""](http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2013/11/moffat-on-doctor-numbering.html)


also:

Technically, if you really counted it, the David Tennant Doctor is two Doctors, on account of the Meta-Crisis Doctor [grown from the Doctor's severed hand in ""Journey's End""]… It’s not a matter of counting the regenerations, but of counting the faces of the Time Lord that calls himself the Doctor.”

Got that? To qualify as the Doctor you need a different face AND the name. Which means the Warrior Doctor is exempt from classification.

“There’s an anomaly Doctor slotted in somewhere, that’s all. In the script to “The Day of the Doctor,” Matt’s Doctor was called the Eleventh, and David’s was called the Tenth, so the numbering stays exactly the same – and we call Peter Capaldi the Twelfth Doctor.”

Paulinho really shouldn't play behind the striker; he simply doesn't have what it takes to get our attackers involved there and it really hinders any offensive ability for the Spurs. And despite that ref being poor throughout the game, he deserved that red card. 

Chadli was good imo. He constantly worked down the left hand side in the first half to get crosses into the box and although some could've been better, it's something that has been lacking for Spurs. Once he switched to a more central role, I thought he did alright considering Spurs midfield was nonexistent all day. 

Soldado was better today. He looked to get involved more often and did what he could given the service. Unfortunately, there was none in the second half. 

Dembele was poor as well. Time and time again he was dispossessed and didn't seem to play with any energy today. 

Lloris kept us in the game despite his one hiccup with the header. A keeper of his quality doesn't deserve the terrible defense we've been displaying.

Soldado needs support. Townsend is on form and fit. Lamela has potential and needs games. Playing at home, that seems like an obvious selection trio.

Naughton looked intimidated for that whole first half, and Liverpool could clearly see that as they piled it on over that side. Perhaps if Fryers had started, their attack would have been thinned out. Although, saying that, Walker and Capoue were providing no cover for Dawson. So Naughton can be entirely to blame.

Allen may be of a similar pace as Gerrard, but his ability to close down in close quarters and win the ball off with the help of another teammate genuinely disrupted the Spurs midfield. 

Henderson also is growing loads. It was an unbelievable performance by him. He was everywhere and made a number of brilliant passes.


It's a weird moment for our club. Gerrard is our talisman. And we know that Suarez is the real reason we can win matches like this. Not just for his scoring ability, but because he requires a whole defenses attention. And with the movement of Coutinho, Sterling, Hendo and even at times Allen, it was like a hot knife through butter. I think without Suarez in the side we need the verve of Gerrard. But when we've got Suarez we have more verve than we know what to do with.

true,BettySw0ll0cks,UnionFlag,London - Honda VFR800," Hey mate, you've thrown up quite a few questions there so I'll try and give you my advice on what I know and how far I get ;)

Helmets. First up, do NOT buy it online until you learn more about your head size. People chirp about it a LOT but ultimately fit is what you want. This means you need to pony up and go into a shop - fit really is your primary goal but it's worth keeping in mind the SHARP rating (http://sharp.direct.gov.uk/). Be warned though a 5 star rating doesn't inheriently mean it's safe as the tests are somewhat artificial. 

Shoei helmets are highly regarded. Sharks RSR2 (and their other *high* end models are very good). AVG do a nice set of higher end gear (My head seems to only fit the K4 but it's noisy as hell). I'd budget around 250-300 if you can afford it.

As a relatively new rider, avoid open face helmets or ones with joints. They're great but best to get some experience up as they are generally less 'safe' than the closed versions.

Personally I prefer kevlar jeans, my Hood K4s lasted an accident and did very well. They also tend to go well with anything.

Mixing and matching gear is really down to your own vanity. I don't personally give a fuck. Buy complementary colours but when it's pissing it down and you want to throw on your wets - staying dry is key

When you buy leathers and textiles. Buy ones with the zip so they attach to each other. It isn't a pretty sight when your gear pulls apart leaving skin exposed. 

RSR is fairly low end, alpine stars is a the expensive ""brand"". I personally like Dainese. Generally keep an eye out for solid protection on the elbows, knees, hips and has space for a back protector insert. Expect to pay 200-300~ for a decent leather jacket and half that for trousers.",0,1387132338,null,0,false,0,ce2cv2x,t3_1sxues,t1_ce2cv2x,t3_1sxues,null,1428122995,7,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,7

true,seppyk,flair3,,"Excuses: Jan and Vlad are still out.  Danny Rose is slowly getting back to form.  Sandro got subbed out for injury early on which was unfortunate.  These were out of our control.

Pros: Chadli does offer some height and physical presence on the left-side.  I think Walker is still showing maturity and that he hasn't reached the peak of his capabilities yet which is exciting.  

Cons: I had disagreement and a bad feeling as soon as I saw our starting lineup.   My guess is AVB was attempting to shore up the weakened back line by playing Chadli in front of Naughton and play a more defensive minded midfield (Sandro and Dembele) with Paulinho who plays box-to-box.   He was trying to compensate for injuries while attempting to emphasize our perceived defensive strength.   

One major problem is that a lot of our attack (when we had possession) went through Chadli which completely exposed the weakness of Naughton behind him.  Sterling was torching him with pace and relative quality.   Chadli needed to slow it down and play more possession.  Given our injuries and defensive weakness, our attacks should have been more concentrated on the side of Walker and Lennon given their pace.

Paulinho and Dembele were playing with poor work rate.  During the first goal replay, you can see Dawson stopped the through ball, Suarez sprints by 3 Spurs players who are playing without urgency, and gets the goal.   Liverpool's offensive line was causing havoc with their work rate up front.   

What I'd like to see: I'd like to see AVB emphasize more player form/quality than tactics because he has typically gotten it wrong against the better competition in the table.   

1. Play Townsend out left where he has shown better team-play and growth potential.
2. Play Lennon out right when we can expose an opposition's poor defensive pace.  Play Lamela out right when we can't and need more creativity.
3. **Always** play Holtby or Eriksen in CAM to get better work rate and creativity.
4. Play Sandro/Capoue and Paulinho/Dembele at CDM/box-to-box midfield depending on form.
5. If we are weak due to injury or opposing tactics, adjust accordingly rather than play the same stubborn tactics for 75 minutes even when it is shown to not work.

While a shock to the system would probably shake things up, it's not a good long term policy.

Leathers aren't all seasons by any stretch. If it's pissing it down you'll soon regret wearing them but they'll handle some light drizzle (have fun drying it out though). When I started I bought textiles as they are all rounders generally. Depending on your financial situation, aim to get a seperate leather suit when you can afford it.

You could potentially cheat and buy leathers and an overcoat. I do carry a ""kag in the bag"" overcoat on long summer trips just in case but you do look a bit of a pillock (a dry pillock).

Brands are a bit hit and miss, I actually bought the triumph adventure jacket and a pair of Richa cold protect gloves. Brands are once again a bit hit and miss as people generally don't buy loads of them as gear is hardly cheap. 

I'm not aware of any 'Slim fit' textiles - hence why I prefer jeans. Most of the time people can't tell as you're riding. Where possible try a pair on. Just make sure the knee protection sits below your actual knee (2-3"" inches) - when you come off it rides up (trust me on this!).

Okay, buy decent boots. Don't fuck about with work boots (especially if they are steel toe caps!!..).

Thankfully boots are a little easier to buy for, You want something solid which (as a boot should) goes up 1/3 of your shin. When you hit the deck it's your ankles that get the beating. I came off and a car run over me (cheers man!) - the boot protected my foot exceptionally well. The first response team were very impressed with how my gear held up. My boots were 'cheap' £100 quid jobbies - sadly I think they are out of production now.

The way we play really looks like 8 v. 11 on offense and then 3 v. 6 when the opponents counter-attack. It makes for some beautiful sportsmanship coming from Verts, Chiriches and Lloris, but it also leads to them getting injured.

Thusly, we have not D left. Cap is now a CB - if I were him, I'd wave the finger at that deal.

Same with Verts. AVB's tactics landed him at LB - precisely NOT what he wanted.

I am a big college Basketball fan in the US and this is like what happened last year to Kentucky. they won the National championship, the next year they couldn't even make it to the tournament. no one threw hissyfits because they new the team was being remodeled and that they would be better the next year. most of this team has been at WHL for less than 18 months! 18 months! the teams Redknapp had had been together for many years for the most part (a new addition here or there but not the same massive influx).  building a great team takes time, not over night.  the only teams that can build great over night at the teams that can spend 500mil on players.

My issue with squad selection was in offense, not defense.

I would have played this group: 

Lloris; Walker, Capoue, Dawson, Naughton; Sandro, Holtby, Gylfi, Chadli, Soldado, Lennon.

Gylfi is our best offensive player atm. Only one reliably scoring goals. Hasn't featured as a number 10 yet, and needs to. Holtby should have started in CM.

This link also has a quote from Lord Morris in regards to the judgement of what force is deemed reasonably necessary.

&gt;""If there has been an attack so that self defence is reasonably necessary, it will be recognised that a person defending himself cannot weigh to a nicety the exact measure of his defensive action. If the jury thought that that in a moment of unexpected anguish a person attacked had only done what he honestly and instinctively thought necessary, that would be the most potent evidence that only reasonable defensive action had been taken ...""

Also S117 Police and Criminal Evidence Act empowers Police to use ‘reasonable force’ if necessary when exercising the powers conferred to them under that act (except those which require someone other than a police officer’s consent).

AVB hasn't given anyone a reason to give him the benefit of the doubt, the team was very average in attacking last year except for Bale going superhuman, and he has always shown an inability to adjust his tactics based on the flow of the game, and based on the teams strengths. He's had almost a year and a half, and I have yet to see any significant improvement in any facet of our game. If anything we have been regressing over that time, I have yet to see anything to the contrary. Something needs to change, and at this point, it has to be AVB.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;It isn't to do with scale...

Of course it is.  Scale and proportionality are everything.  The fact that a bad thing happens is far less important than the amount that it happens.  People die in car crashes, but we don't ban cars because the overwhelming majority of car journeys end safely.  It would not be an appropriate action to take because of the difference in the scale of the problem and the scale of the solution.  We make people buy insurance and wear seatbelts instead, and ban certain behaviour (such as drinking) while driving because these are more narrowly targeted measures.

A £5 billion cut is around 25% of the total family and child welfare bill.  There is no way that this will only target a problem area.  Eliminating genuine scrounging would be nice, but the fact is that you can't do it without also affecting legitimate benefits recipients.  Any responsible policymaker has to take into account *all* of the effects of the current settlement as well as those of any policy change.

The number of families who have children just to get money out of the state is almost certainly tiny.  And as I've already outlined, there may well be reasons why there may be positive aspects to allowing people to have children they otherwise might not be able to currently afford.  It is in no way a black and white issue, where the mere existence of abusers makes the system as a whole in need of swingeing cuts.  The rate at which a problem occurs is critical in determining the net positive/negative outcome of any policy change.",0,1387135120,null,0,false,0,ce2e4ut,t3_1sxdro,t1_ce2e4ut,t1_ce2abgh,null,1428121389,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,seppyk,flair3,,"I could see Siggy as an alternative to Holtby for certain opposition.  However, I see Siggy more as someone who can fill the spot of Paulinho/Dembele when we are looking for a more offensive-minded lineup.  Dembele tends to be a possession midfielder who makes dribbling runs from time to time.  Paulinho is more box-to-box and a poacher.   Siggy is more of a creative final-third finisher since he has the power to let shots fly and the work rate to make runs into the box.   If we could merge Siggy's offensive capabilities, Paulinho's box-to-box positioning, and Dembele's dribbling, we'd have a complete CM. :)

AVB is very conservative in his offensive approach, so we haven't seen Siggy in the center role often.  If my memory is correct, I think Siggy only played one game at CM this season and it was a Europa match against weaker competition so it is difficult to draw conclusions without seeing more.

Otherwise, he's started at LF and cut into the center space similar to Townsend starting at RF.   It was a claustrophobic in the center final third with Siggy/Soldado/Townsend/Eriksen all vying for tight space.   That's how we lost to West Ham.  In fairness, this result was more due to poor tactics from AVB than the quality of the players on the pitch.

We won't get top 4 this year. We might get a europa spot but not definitely. Best hope for any interesting/exciting football would be a run in either the league cup or europa.

Your analysis of him is unfair and incomplete.  

Bilbao are a team who are severely lacking in squad depth due to their policy. They also had an inexperienced squad. But still he managed.  

Plus top of Liga was not something he could break, Top 2 was impossible and 3-5 had teams which had lots of experience and financial muscle.  

This is why they prioritized Europe. They were also quite unlucky in Liga, their naivety at times led them to concede many goals unnecessarily and thus drop points.  

If he went to your team. He'll have a few thing that will be different.  

Firstly the squad is young AND has experience. It has players from all over the world, its not lacking in depth. The players are the sort which are just ideal for a Bielsa system, athletic and technical and like to play fast.  

Bielsa is also someone who brings discipline, players will not slack under him and nearly everyone who has played under him has enjoyed it.  
Its also a sign on intent to everyone concerned that the club is serious.  



Bielsa is THE single most influential Coach of our modern times. Personally i rate him as greater than someone like Sir Alex because the Global impact that Bielsa has had on the game of football will be felt for decades to come, not just at 1 club in 1 league.

Plenty of Poles still come to UK but at the same time depart from here, meaning their total population will most probably not change drastically any time soon.

I used a utility called [Face-Wizard](http://www.gigabyte.com/MicroSite/121/tech_facewizard.htm), as I have a Gigabyte non-EFI motherboard. These are the steps I took to change my boot screen:

1. On Face-Wizard, click the button above ""ON BOARD"" to load the current BIOS from system
2. Using the [original image](http://i.imgur.com/CvQSuA2.png) from an unknown source, I used GIMP to resize it to 640 by 480 and set its mode to 256 color palette (indexed). I saved it as a BMP as Face-Wizard requires.
3. Click ""Load Image"" and locate the bmp file. The slow scrolling display should eventually tell you if the image is OK (it will look a bit strange on the small display, this is normal).
4. Click ""Auto"" to merge the image into the BIOS file and reflash the BIOS.
5. Restart and enjoy!

Hope this helps!

Edit: Here are links to additional logo/picture changers. I have not used these, so *only try these if you are confident they are for your BIOS/motherboard*. If you have an EFI motherboard, its setup screen may have a simpler process for changing the boot image.

true,BitcoinJobe,,IBWT.co.uk - UK Exchange,"My advice: multiple storage devices in multiple wallets.

(assuming you use IBWT)

1. Once you have your coins, create multiple wallets (I could walk you through this), you have to create the extra wallets for this purpose on your own hard drive.

2. Split your wallets, say, 1 Bitcoin per wallet.

3. Save a copy of each wallet via - USB, CD &amp; paper wallet (you can also create a new email address, make sure no one knows, and email a copy of each wallet to this email, assuming the email provider doesn't delete them).

4. I suggest just doing USB/CD/Paper wallet for highest security (have no online copies).

5. Delete the copies off your hard drive.

Now you should have 3+ copies of each wallet, stored/hidden away for that rainy day.

edit: If you use IBWT and wish to store your coins for long storage, you can email me personally via joeld@ibwt.co.uk and/or phone the office line and I'll make sure you do it nice and safely and correctly.

For what it's worth, as much as I disliked many Spurs fans expressing the idea that ""top 4"" was inevitable at the start of the season, the quality that's in your squad is not debatable. You have fantastic players that, for whatever reason, are not clicking together.

Liverpool's performance was driven mainly by two things, in my opinion. First, Rodgers has been building a philosophy into the squad that is paying off in spades right now. Second -- and I think this is more important today, to be honest -- AVB's tactics were *completely wrong* given the opposition. That was obvious 10 minutes into the game. Far too high a defensive line, too ponderous in the middle, playing far too narrow... The list goes on. It wasn't just that Liverpool were good; your manager set his team up to fail.

All that to one side, I truly hope that Spurs continues to improve as a team, despite this set-back. The investment that the club has made, and the quality of Spurs' history, demand it. And a competitive league is far more interesting - as we're seeing this year.

I was really hoping that Spurs would at least draw today to keep Liverpool off of us, but with someone as inept as AVB in charge, I am not surprised at the result. The pressure will just pile on him and he will go on more rants about how the press is conspiring against him and yadda yadda, same old story.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; I am afraid that you are wrong on a lot of points.

I'm always happy to be corrected!

&gt; The existence of a lender of last resort is essential to prevent bank runs.

I think bank runs are more commonly associated with [fractional reserve banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking) coupled with the introduction of investment banking into what you might think of as a ""normal bank"".

The presence or absence of a central bank is largely irrelevant to that. A bank run is every customer turning up and saying ""I'd like my money now please"" when the Bank has locked up that money in a long-term investment.

Northern Rock is the most recent bank run in the UK - that occurred even with the presence of the BoE.


&gt; Separately from that, the central bank provides daily liquidity and guarantees the payment system.

They certainly do. However the way that daily liquidity is managed is by the BoE buying and selling what are termed ""[eligible collateral](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Pages/money/eligiblecollateral.aspx)"" from other banks.

Valid collateral includes things like gilts from the UK government - or the equivalent from Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, or the US.

Unless you're suggesting that the BoE could somehow prevent Scottish banks from purchasing (say) Canadian gilts, or that the BoE would refuse to buy/sell those assets from Scottish banks, I'm not quite why you believe that would be a problem?

The BoE does indeed operate the UK's payment systems. By far the most important of those are [CHAPS and CREST](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Pages/paymentsystems/default.aspx), both of which are international in nature.

You can see the CHAPs membership list [here](http://www.chapsco.co.uk/membership/current_members/). It includes the Bank of America, Citibank (NA), Danske Bank, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Svenska Handelsbanken, etc.

Again, perhaps the BoE would decide that it would have some kind of self-imposed restriction preventing it from having any dealings whatsoever with Scottish banks.

I think that's a pretty unlikely scenario - the reality seems to be more [positive](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-boe-offers-currency-talks-1-3213208).


&gt; Several countries in the Eurozone are beeing kept afloat by loans from the ECB.

I'm not sure if there are any whose sovereign debt is being backed by the ECB directly; I think most are under the so-called ""troika"" (EC, ECB, and IMF operating in partnership).

Historically the IMF has tended to play that role (hence why I mentioned them for Greece; I should have been clearer, sorry).

The EC/ECB are involved this time round purely because the sovereign debt crisis affected multiple countries within the Eurozone and was large enough that it became a threat to the entire project.


&gt; It does not control the money supply-this is determined by the banking system and central bank has no tools that can control it.

I think you may be incorrect here.

The way the UK money supply works is that the BoE will essentially sell commercial banks whatever value of sterling they like - in essence each bank has an overdraft with the BoE. The money supply is controlled (crudely speaking) by the BoE setting a limit on that overdraft.

Banks are not allowed to borrow whatever they like from the central bank, instead the BoE sets the ""reserve ratio"" that a bank must have (""if you borrow X, you must have this %ge of X available to back it"").

It can also adjust the amount of sterling (and hence its value) by buying/selling bonds, but the overdraft model is a simpler explanation.


I think the basic argument for Scotland being able to use the BoE is that, for better or for worse, banking is international in nature nowadays.

Pretty much every aspect of what you might think of as ""domestic banking"" also has an international dimension, and so I really do not think it would be a great stretch for Scotland and rUK to operate in tandem.

The relationship between the central banks (or national banks, if you prefer) and the ECB is not a perfect analogy (they have official representation within the ECB), but in terms of their day-to-day activities (storing government reserves, cooperating with other international central banks, operating domestic payment systems, etc) they are pretty close.

I suspect that the actual outcome will be something like a 5 or 10 year ""Scottish seat"" on the MPC (if the BoE wanted to ensure it was fully aware of what was happening in Scotland in the short term), or simply the normal process by which central banks cooperate with each other.

That may place the ""Scottish Central Bank"" outside the UK system in theory, in practice perhaps it would simply register itself as a UK bank and operate within the UK's framework but with an additional relationship with the Scottish government and any Scottish-only banks that themselves did not operate within the UK's framework.

I know it may seem ludicrous to think that banks and governments might wish to work towards a constructive solution, rather than taking the kind of scorched-earth policy beloved of /r/unitedkingdom, but it seems like a reasonable approach to me.",0,1387138563,null,0,false,0,ce2fmu5,t3_1suzqs,t1_ce2fmu5,t1_ce2e7b1,null,1428120238,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;We need to move away from fossil fuels.

Agreed!

&gt;We are poisoning ourselves so a few can profit. I realise that renewables don't work yet (I have a physics degree I'm not some eco-nut) but we need to use nuclear power while investing in all the alternatives (fusion, solar etc. whatever) on a scale that makes the Manhattan Project look like pocket change.

Right, but the public won't let us. They hate fossil fuels, but they hate nuclear even more, so they ensure nuclear gets nowhere and as a result they (indirectly, moronically) support the use of coal. They're also supporting coal by objecting to fracking, since shale gas is way more environmentally sound than coal, and that's what it can replace (to a good extent).

Nuclear is a nice idea, it's the environmentally responsible base load energy generation method - however it's expensive, it's scary, and the green/left by and large hates it, so it's not happening.

The best case scenario for our energy generation future, short of the government reforming legislation and forcing through lots of nuclear plants tomorrow (oh how happy that would make me) is to maximise the use of shale gas and North Sea assets to minimise the use of coal in the medium term while renewables are further developed to the point where they can actually be utilised in a serious manner without costing 20 pence per kw/h.",0,1387138741,null,0,false,0,ce2fpr2,t3_1svtpg,t1_ce2fpr2,t1_ce29sgw,null,1428120201,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Off the top of my head I can't remember which thread I am responding to, but I said in one thread and I'll say it here, my favorite hockey team's manager is catching a lot of flak for similar reasons. Albeit he has won championships with them in the past, so he's more proven but at the same time he's had some bad seasons last two years and people are starting to say he should be fired, but he's had to deal with nothing but injuries last two years. And if you would ask anyone from the outside looking in they would still tell you that he's probably one of the best managers in the league.

It was just last year AVB was being touted as one of te best currently and places like PSG and Real Madrid* were supposedly courting him. I think he deserves at least the rest of the season and a fair, and objective review. We lost Bale yes, we made a shit ton signings and everyone says that a lot of times they take time to settle in. Combine that with injuries and almost a whole new team, he's already said before he's building for the future. So i for one am willing to wait this out.

Places to buy in London (I'm in London). Err that's a good question.

Healthy competition benefits us all.

I've always laughed at supporters booing the home side. I remember feeling ashamed when the squad were booed during the Cup match against Barnsley a few years back? (Can't remember exactly) But I'm happy that we're not a ""booing"" club.

While its fine again the bottom teams who sit back, Gerrard just cant play in the centre again big pushing teams, even if it is just Southampton.

I think he should be put further up the field where he doesnt have to run his bollocks off to defend, he's probably the 3rd best finisher on the team and to not have him around the final 3rd at all times seems a bit mad, especially when he has great ability to give a through ball.

&gt; I have already mentioned that I was one of the persons who helped to form Umkhonto. I, and the others who started the organization, did so for two reasons. Firstly, we believed that as a result of Government policy, violence by the African people had become inevitable, and that unless responsible leadership was given to canalize and control the feelings of our people, there would be outbreaks of terrorism which would produce an intensity of bitterness and hostility between the various races of this country which is not produced even by war. Secondly, we felt that without violence there would be no way open to the African people to succeed in their struggle against the principle of white supremacy. All lawful modes of expressing opposition to this principle had been closed by legislation, and we were placed in a position in which we had either to accept a permanent state of inferiority, or to defy the Government. We chose to defy the law. We first broke the law in a way which avoided any recourse to violence; when this form was legislated against, and then the Government resorted to a show of force to crush opposition to its policies, only then did we decide to answer violence with violence.

&gt; But the violence which we chose to adopt was not terrorism. We who formed Umkhonto were all members of the African National Congress, and had behind us the ANC tradition of non-violence and negotiation as a means of solving political disputes. We believe that South Africa belongs to all the people who live in it, and not to one group, be it black or white. We did not want an interracial war, and tried to avoid it to the last minute. If the Court is in doubt about this, it will be seen that the whole history of our organization bears out what I have said, and what I will subsequently say, when I describe the tactics which Umkhonto decided to adopt.",0,1387143088,null,0,false,0,ce2hsrr,t3_1sxlfb,t1_ce2hsrr,t1_ce2h21k,null,1428119228,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

People complained about RTD's gollum-doctor. And I see their point.

But I'm sick of Moffat ending a season with ""the universe blows up, oh, hey, it's a paradox, everything is fine"".

He's a brilliant writer - I want more of what he's good at, and less ""look at me, I'm being cinematic! admire my CGI and bask in my music!""

If anything, the only real difference is ""they seem to have a slightly higher special effects budget"" and the special effects are the least interesting part of the show - to me, at least. Some people would watch ""Doctor Who And The CGI Demo Reel"" and never even want a plot, as long as there's flashing lights that look like a space battle. (To be fair, I would watch that, too. But it wouldn't be my first choice for format for the show.)

As for ""sloppy"" - I might prefer the word ""lazy"", with constantly resolving problems with a mixture of ""the doctor lies"" and ""it's a paradox"". But I can see how the lazy approach with no need for an intelligent and logical solution could be called ""sloppy"".

All it takes is a throwaway line ""guess I need to go plant a memorial gravestone in New York"", and they could have each atom buried in a different star in a different universe, and the whole ""fixed point in time"" issue would be averted.

For example, Soldado last year with Valencia. played a 4-2-3-1, with Jonas, who is less of a poacher and more technically skilled than Soldado, playing behind Soldado. They combined their tally for 37 goals in La Liga. They also played with traditional wingers, as opposed to the favored inverted style AVB prefers to play. Their central midfield focused on creativity, with Ever Banega, Tino Costa and Jonas combining for 13 assists. Their 1st team wingers had 9 assists combined. 

As you can see, Valencia's style and AVB's style differ a lot. AVB likes to play inverted wingers and his midfield prefers defense over creativity. There isn't a CF behind Soldado. If AVB really wants to improve Soldado's play, he should play like this:

Walker-Dawson-Vertonghen-Rose

Eriksen-Paulinho/Sandro

Lennon/Chadli-Siggy/Ade/Holtby/Dembele-Lamela/Townsend

Soldado

Eriksen's creativity is needed in a deeper role, but he should still hold the freedom to make runs forward and take shots outside the box. In the CF role, we need someone with dribbling skills and pace to take on opponents. Right now, I'm leaning towards Dembele, as he played in that role a few times at Fulham and impressed. Adebayor isn't pacy enough and disappears a lot during games, and the CF plays a key role in this formation.

I'm leaning towards Lennon in this formation, since his pace links up well with Walker, however Chadli's is moderately fast and he's an aerial threat. Lamela tends to drift towards the center, but I can see him changing the game more than Townsend. 

The only position I'm unsure about is who plays next to Eriksen and behind Dembele. For one thing, there's Sandro, who is a beast as well all know. However, there is also Paulinho, who is a box to box midfielder and operates similarly to Ever Banega. Holtby or Siggy can also play there, if AVB was to overdose on creativity, but I doubt he'll play them so deep. I would go with Holtby as of now, due to his amazing form recently.

What AVB has to do is find his starting 11 and play them. The only time he should change them is for Cup and Europa matches, as well as injuries. Aside from that, the starting 11 should be the same for every league game.

true,SleepyDustKing,null,null,"The use of force in the first quote you posted is from the section titled 'European Court of Human Rights', referring to use of force that is deadly. The whole section:

&gt; A distinction has been made between the use of force which is intended to be lethal, or as a result of which death occurs, and other uses of force. Article 2 will be invoked whenever death occurs at the hands of the state (or serious injury in a situation where death could have occurred) irrespective of the police contact or type of force or weapon used.

&gt;The European Court has held that this will apply to the use of force which:

&gt; * is intended to result in the death of a person and which has that effect
results in the death of a person and which could have been reasonably foreseen to have that consequence
&gt; * results in serious injury to a person, where death could have occurred.

&gt;In any of the above situations, force can only be used where it is no more than absolutely necessary. Any use of force must be reasonable in the circumstances. This means that:

&gt; * the use of force must be absolutely necessary for a purpose permitted by law, such as self-defence, defence of another, to prevent crime, or to effect a lawful arrest – force should be the last resort
&gt; * the amount of force used must also be reasonable and proportionate and the degree of force used must be the minimum required in the circumstances to achieve the lawful objective, otherwise, it is likely that the use of force will be excessive and unlawful.

Second quotes you've used; I'm not saying the officer acted unlawfully, that was a misunderstanding on my part. But the officer code of practice says that **the least amount of force possible must always be used.**

This was not the case in this instance, or at the very least we cannot be sure reasonable force was used without proper context.

true,Caldariblue,null,null,"I hate to break it to you, but you really don't know as much about the law as you think you do. You keep quoting from a page from the college of policing's public order section which contains this:

&gt;The Criminal Law Act 1967, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and **common law apply to all uses of force by the police** and require that any use of force should be ‘reasonable’ in the circumstances.

Common law, as I've explained to you a few times contains provisions for the use of force in self defence.

It goes on to say that the _degree_ of force used should be minimal. This is referring to a ""use of force continuum"". (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_force (which amusingly also states &gt;In England and Wales the use of (reasonable) force is provided to police and any other person from Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967)).

So no, you've not posted the ""official guidance on use of force"". It does not clearly state the the least amount of force must be used. It does however clearly state that police officers like any person are subject to common law, which does make provisions for them to use reasonable force in their own defence.

You can accept this, or not. You could even pose this as a question to a lawyer. You could actually go so far as to test it (but I advise against this).",0,1387146483,null,0,false,0,ce2jcw9,t3_1sxdnm,t1_ce2jcw9,t1_ce2ipbm,null,1428118501,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Watch out matches, every match, with the exception of this weeks Anzhi win. The players just look utterly bewildered during games, nobody knows that the fuck they are doing.

It's like a jigsaw, you expect to see experimentation and some trial and error to get pieces to fit. Instead we appear to have a guy who gets two pieces to fit, then takes one out, puts another in it's place and tries to use a hammer to get the same result.

Players seem confused as fuck. Last season it was ""Meritocracy"" you play well and you get your spot. How many times this season has a player performed poorly (Townsend for example) and kept their spot. Or come in and played well (Holtby) only to end up on the bench.

I feel like we have gone from one extreme to the other. Redknapp appeard to just photocopy the teamsheet from the previous week, and his tactics were along the lines of ""Go out on the pitch and make football happen."" Now it's AVB who seems to want a different team every week and expects them to go out and act out a football match to a perfect tune.

Now the big, huge question is, how much belief and confidence do the players have in AVB? If the players think ""Fuck yes we can make this guys plan work"" then we have to stick with AVB at least until the end of the season. If they are behind a manager and he gets thrown out things could get a lot worse. If he has lost the dressing room, then unfortunately I think his job goes with it.

I like AVB, honestly I want the guy to succeed. I feel like Chelsea shat on him. I don't think he **HAS** to go though, but I do think he needs to admit he has fucked up, and he needs to put some serious fucking work in to make it right. My concern for him on a personal level is that if he doesn't make a personal change, then his time in football management is up. 

His system worked at Porto, but it has not worked since. usually older managers set in their ways struggle to adapt to changes in the game. AVB is a young guy who should be able to adapt and survive. Nobody in football is going to want to hire that guy who does the same thing at every club and hopes it works somehow.

My biggest concern however is that this is personal, and that he wants to win ""his way"" to prove something to everyone. Essentially as though he absolutely has to prove his way was the right way at Chelsea and that his failure was the fault of everyone else.

So because I disagree with you I am a troll? 

&gt;It's called logical business sense, it's also why many big businesses make you sign a contract that specifically states you cannot work for rival businesses after leaving (go and look into it), you should know this.

So they can't get revenge? Businesses do that so they can't give away trade secrets. It doesn't have anything to do with emotion. 

&gt;AVB was probably given a number of teams to Manage after he left (the same with RDM), and he chose Spurs for obvious reasons (Pay, Rivals, Bale) - He was also pretty pissed at losing the Chelsea position, so again, signing up to the rival team is icing on the cake.

This is not FIFA, you don't leave and then are given 3 different clubs to pick from. He probably didn't receive many offers that he thought were his level except Tottenham, so he chose them. He also wouldn't have had to move much if at all. AVB doesn't seem like the type to have an emotional connection to his club, just look at his interviews about retiring early and leaving football management.

The link absent from your quote (i put it back in) links to a wired story that is just reporting on the Open Rights Group link I already gave you. The one where they said that they put together that list of categories.

The problem is that the ORG tried to work out what a list of filters might look like. However, they gave no evidence that this list came from the government, just that it's what ISPs had already implemented or were thinking of implementing. 

In fact in their article they never even suggest that this list is government mandated. It's just the people who then wrote articles on their list that assumed it was.

I'd love to see a government published list if it exists. But I've never seen one and this is a topic I've been very interested in and have followed extensively.

* Amy came together with the Smith/Moffat reboot to Matt Smith and got an awesome storyline that involved a cute little redheaded girl.

So while I liked her a lot during her time on the show, of course she's the one that least stands out.

Her initial storyline hurt her character even more: falling in love with the Doctor was boring (we start to fear that all companions will do that, isn't it enough that they are always girls?) Although now that I think about it, she then falls *out* of love with him and is the only companion in New Who to decide to go do her own thing, so one could argue she's the most grown-up and independent of them all :)

That is my favourite thing about Martha and something I hope happens more in the future.

My understanding of the law surrounding the use of 'reasonable force' by police. 

&gt;1): Section 117 Police &amp; Criminal Evidence Act (1984) 117 governs the use of force in relation to all PACE powers. allowing the constable to use reasonable force when necessary. ie; reasonable force to Stop &amp; Search and Arrest.

&gt;2): Section 3 Criminal Law act (1967) gives ANYONE the ability to use reasonable force when required in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large

&gt;3): Common Law provides a person a right of self defence - ""A defendant is entitled to use reasonable force to protect himself, others for whom he is responsible and his property. It must be reasonable."" Definition is from Beckford v R (1988)

&gt;4): Human Rights Act (1998) criminalise acts such as torture and ensures a persons right to a private life, therefore it also impacts levels of force.

edit: http://www.policespecials.com/forum/index.php/topic/117788-police-use-of-force/

Understandably, protesters and the police might well comprehend the concept of ‘reasonable force’ differently. A report on the issue:

&gt;A 2009 report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) identifies a lack of clear standards, inconsistent approaches and inappropriate use of powers as key issues in policing protests.  The report expresses concern about the use of force by police, and advocates a full review to ensure that force used is ‘necessary and proportionate’.  This level of concern stems from a lack of consistency and from inadequate regulation and guidance.  Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Guidance manuals ‘lack detail’ on the subject, and while police teaching plans did emphasise the need for proportion and necessity in police responses, ‘explanations of ""proportionate"" varied’.  The report concludes that **‘there is no consistent doctrine articulating the core principles around the police use of force’.  Again, we see that the substantive content of 'reasonable force' varies significantly and apparently arbitrarily**.

&gt;The police have the authority to use force in specified circumstances. Two of the nine principles attributed to Sir Robert Peel address the use of force. The first makes the fundamental statement that “the degree of co-operation of the public that can be secured diminishes  proportionately to the necessity of the  use of physical force”. The second states that **“police use physical force to the  extent necessary to secure observance of  the law or to restore order only when the exercise of persuasion, advice, and warning is found to be insufficient”**

&gt;In summary, Adapting to Protest concluded that there was a lack of clarity around the approach to, and corporate 
oversight of, the use of force in public order policing. Recommendation 10 of Adapting to Protest therefore advocated a review of public order training that addressed the full spectrum of public order activity and incorporated relevant human rights principles and standards on the use of force.

* **Guss Hiddink** - I like Guss, i think we would at least be much more attacking in our approach. Not sure he would be a long term solution but i think he would be entertaining in the short term.

* **Frank De Boer** - Solid manager and a guy who i think is in that area where he would be looking for a step up into a bigger role and a bigger league. I think he would be a very interesting choice if we could buy him out from Ajax. Does have the feeling a tough signing for us at midseason though.

* **Murat Yakin** - Good manager with great tactical awareness, plays some attractive football is bound to make the jump up to a bigger club/league from Basel in the near future. Another one that seems like he would be a tough signing at mid-season.

* **Tim Sherwood** - Obviously knows the club and it has been rumored that Levy has been grooming him to be the future head of the club.  If we were looking for a caretaker and then to chase someone in the summer Sherwood seems like the easy choice, knows the team, knows the players, has Levy's ear and would do whats best for the club if asked to, if handling the the club short term was what he was asked i think he would do it.

Personally, i would love to get Bielsa but i don't know that he would be a great fit for a mid-season change, his system isn't something that is implemented overnight and he does have a reputation for being a bit crazy.

After Bielsa i would look to Yakin and De Boer personally, i think both play good football (with systems that wouldn't take major growing pains to install) and both could be long term solutions.

However i would be prepared for Sherwood for the rest of the season with us chasing a bigger manager in the summer.",0,1387149011,null,0,1387149270,0,ce2kguq,t3_1sylge,t1_ce2kguq,t3_1sylge,null,1428117983,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"Liverpool got a lot of success against Spurs by sending semi-speculative passes beyond the Spurs defence while Suarez was hanging on the blind side of defenders.  This worked so well because of that notorious high defensive line that Lloris used to be so good at covering.  It seemed that Lloris isn't dashing out as quickly as he usually does so Suarez had tons of space to run into.

It was a ruthless attacking display that played on a known weakness of the Spurs set-up, rather than a display of technical superiority.  Spurs didn't carve out any opportunities, but I don't think there's much creativity in their squad - especially with Eriksson out.

Liverpool played to their well crafted plan today and did so exceptionally well, but they can't come to us with the same plan, so I'd be reluctant to put too much stock in today's result.

Maths.  Easy practical choice.  Especially with Economics.  Go to the Career's library and ask them for a copy of the UCAS book.  In it will be a list of university courses and what A-levels they advise to get on the course.  If you want good conditional offers they're going to be looking at your subjects.  Maths is a solid.  I would say that if you can't walk an A at GCSE you shouldn't be doing A level maths.  Harsh  advice, but there it is.  I know people that did, and got through it, but I saw people struggle too.

If you like Geography that much and want to travel, Geography might be seen as a bit of a soft course at uni  but you might want to look at Geology as a mature natural progression.  Lots of scope for travel with that, lots of money to be made too.  Geography might be something they look for at A-level when choosing Geology.  You don't have to go into a geology field.  I know someone who ended up going into brokering with their geology degree - but you can make a career out of travelling and make an absolute packet.  It's petrochemicals and mining and the skill travels well.

If you're going to be thinking of Physics at Uni you'll need Maths.  You'll also need an extra curricular activity which introduces you to girls, because there'll be a rarity on your course.

For drama here is a nice spread of stuff:

Utopia - hard to describe but one of the most visually impressive British shows I've seen

Broadchurch - detective drama set in small seaside town with David Tennant

Cassanova - another one with Tennant but also the now deceased Peter O Toole in an OTT production about the life of Cassanova

The Street - drama following residents in a Manchester street with an all star cast

Life on Mars followed by Ashes to Ashes - you must have heard the plot already

Party Animals - follows a number of twentysomethings working in Westminster

Accused - anthology series about people awaiting their verdict in court. Sean Bean was incredible in his ep!

The Fades - teenage boy is haunted by his disturbing dreams

The Hour - about journalists working in the BBC in the 1950s

In The Flesh - zombies!

And don't discount reality TV/documentaries:

Our War - about British army soldiers in Afghanistan

24 hours in A&amp;E - follows a number of patients as they need emergency care

If you like Masterchef-type shows and baking, there is Great British Bake Off which is very British

Gogglebox - you watch people watching TV. Sounds nuts but it's a cult hit over here.

Educating Yorkshire - documentary about a secondary school in a small town in West Yorkshire

If you look through some uni prospectus', nearly anything Science-based will want Maths, so it definitely helps keep your options open more than Geography will.

Whilst you might not enjoy Maths as much as Geography, or feel the same affinity for it, the overlap with other subjects will help compensate. If you're doing Physics then the Maths mechanics modules will seem very easy, and you'll find the maths skills help make Physics and Chemistry easier. Maths also tends to have larger class sizes so it's easier to find people to work with.

Overall on your choices, Maths+Physics+Chemistry is a fantastic combination, opens up the whole of engineering, chemistry, and even some biological sciences would rather you had A level Chemistry than Biology. If Economics is your thing then doing the subject makes sense, although again it might be worth reading a prospectus for a university course to see if it's required to do degree level Economics.

The problem with our team isn't AVB's starting tactics, nor the players not performing. It's the lack of tactical changes AVB lack when we're not doing well during a game. Every substitutions he's made this and last season is to just bring on a different personnel for a straight swap. No change of formation to counter our opponents's tactics. 

Like I said in previous posts, I don't want us to keep changing managers, but AVB has to learn to be more flexible with his tactics, if his preferred 4-3-3 isn't working, he needs to change it if he wants to hang on to his job. Let's hope the pressure put on him now will make him change the way he thinks and simply going by the books isn't going to work against better teams.

2. Agree but who would you have started instead of him? Everyone was injured.

3. Many would argue that Holtby deserves to play #10. I am one of those people. I have not been impressed with Eriksen, although I agree that he has a lot of potential. 

4. Chadli was good today. Lennon was good last game on the right. Townsend was good last game on the left. 

5. In my opinion, the lack of optimism was due to injuries that forced us to have a weak back line. I thought Dembele, Paulinho, and Sandro would dominate the midfield. 

Perhaps when it comes to pure skill, you are right about Lamela v. Lennon. But Lamela has only had one strong game, and it was against a sub-par team. He did not and has not impressed against any EPL teams. I want him to do well, but it would be wishful thinking to say that he has been doing well thus far. One could argue that he would play better if he was given more minutes, but then people would start complaining that the manager is playing favorites when the others are clearly outperforming him.

No offence, but your understanding of addiction honestly reminds me of something Peter Hitchens said, almost verbatim.

&gt;Taking the drugs that lead to addiction is a choice. The addiction is a result of you deciding to take drugs.

That's a massive over-simplification of a complex problem. For one it's not entirely environmental. Some people are born with a greater potential to pick up a substance abuse problem.

To say people choose to be addicted by taking addictive drugs is to imply that people are aware that they will become addicted (take note here the godawful education children are given about drugs in this county. The blatant scaremongering makes kids think it's a joke and end up not trusting a word of it). Ask any addict and they will tell you they never chose to become addicted. Addiction creeps up on you and rarely can be pinpointed to a specific event.

For me I can see the seeds of addiction all the way back into my childhood. I was not taught how to deal with my emotions and as such picked up what I learned from those around me. People do not choose to not be taught how to deal with their emotions.

&gt;A minority of addicts have mental health problems 

Sorry but what? Literally, what? Addiction is almost entirely a mental health problem. It is a sickness of the mind. It is doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result: It is insanity by definition. You are not going to convince me otherwise on this.

Not only that, it's CERTAINLY not true that a minority of addicts have pre-existing mental health issues. What do you think drives most of us into addiction in the first place?

&gt;they need to want to be helped

This is the one point I agree with you on. And with a baby on the way I certainly agree that some form of institutionalisation was necessary — just not prison! And certainly not THIS prison!

Anyway—as an addict—acknowledging one has an addiction and then getting into a position to deal with it is a challenge that should not be understated in its mind-bending difficulty. I've been through some tough shit in my life, but dealing with my addictive tendencies has by far been the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

Machine. He's never ever really looked at of place, ever.. sure he's made mistake but following my u23 rule he's allowed and supposed to make mistakes in order to learn from them. He made Gerard Deulofeu one of Barcelona's TOP TOP prospects look like a fucking school boy, I love the way he just deny's players on runs like carra used to do, doesnt always chase but when they're coming at him he holds his ground and sends them flying

&gt; Whats he like on the training grounds?

He's like all the other kids that have had a taste of the first team, they're ready at all times to fight to the DEATH if need be, they/he works harder than anyone to prove their worth, he's no exception

&gt; What do you think about his potential or lack of?

true,Mister_Six,eng-middlesex,Middlesex,"To be fair it's not *entirely* the fault of the clubs. I've worked at Emirates, Stanford Bridge, Craven Cottage, and White Hart Lane, all as an agency worker. In my experience, pretty much all the bar, till, cleaning, security, and waiting staff are subcontracted out by the clubs to agencies who then provide workers.  

 Now, usually (in fact pretty much all the time with the small exception, all though not by much, of security) these agencies pay their workers piss poor wages. In fact, most of the agencies will be paid the same amount per worker as the clubs or venues would pay their own staff doing the same job, but once the agency takes their bite out of that paycheque (usually around 50%) the worker is chucked what's left over, usually about minimum wage.  

I remember working at Wembley (I know, not a specific club ground) but another worker in the bar I was at was hired straight through Wembley whereas I was being hired through an agency, and I made a little over half what he did for the day, with me being paid hourly and him on a day rate. You will find this is the case all over.  
My point being, the larger problem is that agencies like this will not only offer their workers jobs only sporadically, but will take out half their paycheques for doing pretty much fuck-all (apart from middle manning).  
I think if these kind of practices were legislated against, either through forcing companies (not just clubs) to hire temps after they have worked for the company for a certain number of days/times, or by forcing companies to expand their HR departments and just hire in staff (doing away with agencies all together) you would see people getting paid a fair amount for what they are doing.  

**TL;DR It's mainly through the use of temporary work agencies that workers in places like this get fucked over on their wages, and whilst technically this is indeed down to the agencies over how much they pay, it is still in the clubs' power to stop using them and hire their own staff and pay a fair wage**",0,1387152917,null,0,false,0,ce2m69k,t3_1sxkcr,t1_ce2m69k,t3_1sxkcr,null,1428117088,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt; It's mind blowing how you think what Google is doing is worse and that the ""security services"" aren't doing much with the data they collect.

As a geek I've long known about ECHELON, Carnivore etc etc so maybe I've just had longer to ""adjust"". I've been measuring every click on the web for about five years, knowing full well that every URL is probably being databased by the UK government. A couple of years ago I was worried that I was being overly paranoid on the last part and in a way I'm ""relived"" that I was right. 

To believe that they are not doing this is naive. It is, as you say, here to stay. The solution to this mess does not involving reigning in GCHQ. Even if you could get political support to do so there would be absolutely zero trust in anything they could do. They could comply fully with new regulations and we'd still not fully believe them. The solution lies in new protocols which eliminate the issues in the first place. We're already seeing this with new messaging platforms and a new way of serving web content will no doubt follow. 

Getting angry about GCHQ is a waste of time. Nothing will change on that front. I prefer to direct my energies into things that can change, such as the third-party resale of this data. 

&gt;  Regardless of if you're a nobody, that's hardly the point. You could be a somebody and if you were, they have a whole lot of information to destroy your character.

For the record I was unofficially warned a few years ago that my house phone was almost certainly bugged as I was renting out a spare room to someone who worked for the SNP. But they have little to destroy my character because I know what they are doing. I know that every click on a porn site is going on my personal record. 

&gt; GCHQ and the NSA are spying on everyone to shape the future and stop dissent. 

Google etc are spying to shape desires. They are in a far more powerful position than GCHQ. They are our gateway to the sum of human knowledge and their ""bubbles"" limit what we see on any topic we look up. Cross border law makes them pretty much accountable to no one. GCHQ wants to control the political activists, google wants to control everyone. That's why they are more dangerous, their control is more direct. 

Furthermore, if you are concerned with people trying to ""shape the future and stop dissent"" then surely the BBC ought to be your number one complaint? If you consider the chain of how ""the establishment"" does influence people (e.g. telling us who to label as ""a regime"") then the vocal arm is probably a better place to start imho. If GCHQ is the eyes then the BBC is the mouth. ",0,1387153389,null,0,false,0,ce2mdpn,t3_1sy3oh,t1_ce2mdpn,t1_ce2kxfq,null,1428116991,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"So....with Bielsa its not a pure ""system"" that he runs per se, he is very tactical, he will change formations as he sees fit. So its not like he will get locked into playing a 4-3-3 no matter what, he will change on the drop of a hat if he thinks it will make a difference.

I have seen a couple people say that Pep Guardiola is a disciple of Bielsa, i think that may be partially true as Guardiola certainly is influenced by Bielsa but he is also clearly influenced by Cruyff and Cruyff's ideas about possession and belief that wingers pace the attack. Then again, Bielsa and Cruyff hold a belief that the midfield setting the tempo with players flowing forward are very much in line with each other.

Bielsa is really known for very. very fluid up tempo attacking football but he isn't locked into a single formation (whereas Cruyff adamantly believes a 4-3-3 is the formation to employ) though he does often utilize a 4-3-3.  He wants to attack he wants people pushing up field. The man is a monster when it comes to details, he apparently lives on game film and is a huge fan of statistical analysis.  You ever wonder how Lamela plays after eating pasta primavera the night before a match while playing a right footed defender while on the road in the rain with a southern wind in the stadium?....Bielsa doesn't, he probably has information on exactly that situation somewhere and he will draw upon it. He may have the game film, hell he may have the game film from 4 different angles and he has probably watched it 3 times from each angle.  This is a guy who's attention to detail makes Mourinho look disinterested in football.  He really may be a certifiable genius in terms of football knowledge.

On the other hand the type of understanding of tactics and roles a player has would be like when we moved from 'Arry to AVB.  It has a learning curve, and it can be steep...very steep.  Players have been known to struggle in learning how to play for him and chafe under his constant attention to detail. The end results can be breath taking, but getting everyone on the same page isn't easy and some players/coaches will struggle mightily to adjust.

Also keep in mind that he is.....er, eccentric?....eccentric may be the easiest way to describe him.  He is known for giving press conferences that rival Fidel Castro speeches in terms of length.  He is completely the type of guy who can easily rub people the wrong way and he isn't afraid to speak his mind. I have also seen it said that since his English isn't great that he may not want to coach in England.

I think if we could get him, it would be worth the risk.  Yes he could drive the players crazy, yes he could infuriate the other coaches, yes he would likely drive our media relations completely mad and yes he would almost certainly be constant fodder for the press and absolutely it could blow up in our face. It could very easily be the type of situation that would go down as a massive mistake. 

But if it clicked....well, if it clicked....it could be something very, very special.

IMO a slightly better solution to blocking would be to just allow everything to pass though, and log everything that would otherwise be filtered, and investigate the accounts that make their way to the top of the most logged list.

But that wouldn't change the main issues; who watches the log/block makers, and who decides what gets someone/some website on that list.

No-one's going to argue against blocking child porn, or jihadist sites with bomb making instructions (as if that isn't the kind of knowledge you can find in a library...) or neo-nazi sites, some might argue against blocking pro-racist or anti-gay sites, some still more might argue against blocking extreme fringe political sites.... somewhere there is a line, but not being able to know where that line is, is a bad thing.

Btw I'm not saying that the *IWF* is doing this, but since the technology exists and is already being used for blocking perfectly tame sites involved in copyright infringement, the discussion on where that line should be drawn is an extremely worthly one.",0,1387157529,null,0,false,0,ce2o779,t3_1sy2jt,t1_ce2o779,t1_ce2mdav,null,1428116142,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Sure, we want to play attacking football, but you just need to watch a City game or two to see that this can be done without a high line. The insistance to stick to it after what happened with City is an example of the stubbornness that is quickly becoming his trademark.

Secondly, part of the reason we are in such bad shape defensibly should fall on AVB's shoulders. The failure to bring in a left back over the summer and loaning out BAE stretched us way too thin when Rose inevitably went down and set of a domino effect of back line injuries. Vertonghen got push out left and was run into the ground which left us with no cover at CB.

Finally, it wasn't just the defense. Don't forget that we didn't get a single shot on goal. We got dominated in the midfield. You would think that with the high line we would at least be able to get the ball into a dangerous position a few times.

I have been a defender of AVB and have been content to be patient through a rocky transition, but the stubbornness today has caused me to start reevaluating that stance.

Why is AVB not culpable when his team plays like shit. This was one of the biggest games of the season, if he can't get his team to come out for this then we have bigger problems than tactical ones. One thing I will give him is that he can't account for Sandro going down early and that's a huge loss. However it was 1-0 at that point and our midfield was playing like shit before that.

&gt; AVB doesn't buy or sell players. Don't try to pretend like he does, because that's the entire reason he's not a ""manager"" he's a ""head coach."" Our failure to secure a LB to replace Benny isn't AVB's fault.

You act like we didn't have a choice with getting rid of Benny. He may not be in charge of transfer dealings, but don't pretend like he doesn't have any influence on them. If AVB had wanted Benny to stay he would have stayed.

&gt; Can you suggest anything to fix our midfield just being abjectly awful? And if not, how is it AVB's fault that they were that awful?

Yes I can. Our midfield selection today was terrible. Chadli, who actually played OK for stretches was a defensively motivated selection. Paulinio and Dembele have shown in the past that they are horrible together. We started the game without a #10 until the Sandro injury forced him to put Holtby on.

true,melihs11,null,null,"woke up, calmed down, and here are my thoughts

AVB's stubbornness, inability to change things around and continuing to use the suicidal tactic that got him fired from Chelsea is going to get him fired from here

Just so many things have been wrong this season, and it all comes down to AVB, and his mis-management.

- let's start with the left back problem. part of avb's style of play and build up is the fullbacks providing balance, width, and support. with this, you have to ensure you have those players, otherwise the balance comes undone, structure goes to shit and there's no attacking support. we had rose and benny, AVB decided to alienate benny and leave us with just Rose, who had only just come back from loan. why let go of benny, for nothing even, he is still in london just plays down the road, leave us with one natural LB? vertonghen can play there yes, but it makes us so much weaker in the centre, and he doesn't look comfortable out there, nor does he like it. he has tried naughton, and that has been a spectacular failure. it has left us exposed, un-balanced, and puts us into trouble more often then not.

- the high line can work very well, but it required a very drilled defence and a midfield to continually press. what went through AVBs mind when he thought it would be a good idea to play a high line against Suarez, Sterling and Coutinho, with Dawson at CB, a DM having to play CB, and a RB having to play LB? it is just suicide and asking to get torn to shreds, which we did.

- his team selection has been horrible. it's fundamental that a team has to have a settled XI, how is this going to help when you chop and change, play holtby one week who plays a blinder, then drop him, play chadli when he's straight back from injury, playing two inverted wingers which weren't working from the first moment they stepped out onto the pitch, suffocating our own midfield, running paulinho into the ground by playing him every minute of every game, saying he rewards players who play well when his mis-use of lamela shows he doesn't, playing defoe upfront on his own in some games when it's been clear for almost 10 years that he can't do that and he will be incredibly ineffective, there's so many to name.

- he tries to bed new guys in slowly, which can be fine, but what he's done to lamela so far has almost destroyed him. he played a blinder against anzhi, was unplayable, he should have been rewarded with a start the following week against newcastle at home, perfect game to give him a start and make him make the right side his own, instead he is thrust back on to the bench, doesn't play a single minute, we lose, and he starts lamela the following week AWAY to manchester city, throwing him in the deep end and telling him to swim. such poor management of our record signing and player who has the potential to be one of the world's best.

- he doesn't tailor his tactics to the players he has at his disposal. he can't. he only knows, and plays 1 style of play. if you don't have the right players available to play the system that you want, then change it up a bit to suit what you have available. you like playing a high line, sure, play it when we have our first defence of walker, vertonghen, kaboul, rose available, don't fucking play it when we have to play capoue at CB, and naughton at LB. he is trying to force this one, rigid style of play on to everyone when it's clear a lot of the player skill sets we have just aren't right for what AVB wants to try to do.

- with all that, going forward, we have absolutely NO build up play. we don't know what to do in the final third. there has been absolutley NO evidence of me seeing just ONE game where everything has clicked and we looked devastating, not once since he has been here. we are slow and pedestrian going forward. of all the goals we have scored, most have come down to individual brilliance, no build up play. since city, we had a decent little run, but look at the goals scored. sandro wondergoal, walker freekick, chiriches wonder goal, holtby wonder goal, o'shea own goal. all down to individual play, no passing between team mates, one two's, crosses being drilled in, through balls being played over. we are a bunch of individuals.

- to those saying we bought heaps of players, they need time etc. etc. we had the SAME problem last season too. most of our goals came from individualism again, only difference was Bale did it more frequently last season so it papered over the cracks. 18 months, and even the players that have been here since AVB was appointed don't look like they have a clue to the way he wants to play. 18 months and even crystal palace can string a pass together in the final third these days. something we have been incapable of since AVB was appointed.

AVB was literally given the keys to WHL. he was given our current squad, minus bale + 100m to build the team he wants, and all he has done is buy a bunch of players and try to force them to play to his system, a system which doesn't suit our strengths, and as a result, we have been spanked 6-0 away to city, 3-0 at home to west ham, and 5-0 at home to liverpool, our worst loss at home since Christian Gross.

it's not going to change. AVB isn't going to miraculously drop his philosophy overnight. if he stays, it's going to be the same shit until we get another shredding, and then Levy will have no choice.",0,1387160577,null,0,false,0,ce2piml,t3_1sxyg9,t1_ce2piml,t3_1sxyg9,null,1428115527,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Look at our bench; a GK, a LB, and 5 attacking midfielders, none of whom would have helped our central midfield in the least; the only player who might have was Holtby, and he came on and didn't make a lick of difference.

And yes, it's AVB's job to get us up for the game, but to be honest, we mostly looked up for the game; but Dembele was lethargic today. He was jogging around from the whistle, not trying to win 50-50 balls, not supporting our wing players, slowing us down enormously. But the only player we had on the bench who could have replaced him was Holtby, who had to come on for Sandro.

Our biggest issues today, as I saw them, were as follows; 1) Our midfield got outworked. Paulinho got no help anywhere from Dembele, who was awful. His lack of effort in midfield gummed us up going forward, and he turned the ball over a LOT in midfield.
2) We got abused on the left. They set up to isolate Naughton and let Sterling/Suarez run at him, and when we rotated to help him, we either didn't rotate down from midfield and take away the square ball back to their midfield, or Capoue just didn't rotate at all.
3) We couldn't get the ball up and attack, for many of the same reasons i've outlined above. But this meant that our makeshift defense had a ton of pressure applied to it. Let's be honest here; Liverpool came out today with the intent to pressure our every touch of the ball, knowing that as thin as we were at the back, we would probably crack under the pressure. We did. But we also played every fit central/defensive player we had today, so I'm not sure how AVB could have done anything differently.",0,1387160688,null,0,false,0,ce2pkej,t3_1syyy6,t1_ce2pkej,t1_ce2pb56,null,1428115504,-2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-2

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"It is worth remembering that the bulk of the UK's railways were built a very long time ago as private enterprises, quite often as purely speculative ventures. Some worked well such as the descison to run the Waterloo-Southampton line via Basingstoke rather than Alton (a far more important town at the time) or Guildford which lead to Basingstoke growing substantially. Others such as the Meon Valley line never really saw much use (the line was actually one of the last built to mainline standards, and it was planned in 1896). When the railways were nationalized after WW2 (which happened because they were hemorrhaging money), it became clear that not all lines were worth electrifying and quite a few were not used enough to justify keeping them open. 

It's also worth remembering that since much of our railway network was built, the population it serves has changed dramatically. People live and work in different places, and rightly or wrongly we've spent the last 50 years or so designing things around car travel. I'm a huge supporter of train travel over car travel, but in order to make the modern railway network viable there are a lot of changes that need to be made. These include building new lines and stations, and unfortunately closing other stations and lines that are no longer needed. Such as this one, which goes to a place that has shut. However, building new lines isn't as simple as it was a century ago, so the costs of doing so are likely to match the absurd costs of HS2.

Being in the celebrations for all the goals but especially goals 3,4,&amp;5 just looked and sounded awesome and I only wish I could have been there.

true,scwol,cnty-uk,Somerset in Scotland,"I'm in first year at university, so this is what I'd do with the goal of university admissions in mind.

Tailor your A Level choices to your intended degree subject. If you're quite keen on studying Geography, take that, but for almost everything else I'd choose Maths. It's looked on favourably for admissions in most subjects. You've said you want to travel and see the world - most degree subjects will allow you to this in some way. You can usually study abroad from any subject, which is a good way to spend a year living in a foreign country without committing to a permanent move and maintaining a strong support network. In terms of travel post-university a language is the obvious choice, maths can offer quite a few opportunities in finance.

Secondly, think long and hard about taking four subjects at all. If you look at University prospectuses, offers are always stated in terms of three grades - four is very rarely necessary, even for top 10 universities. This depends on the record of your school, if you're attending a highly ranked private school then they probably will expect four, but if you're at a state FE College or Sixth Form three is very much the norm.

A fourth A-Level can turn into a liability. Not only have you got a whole extra A-Levels worth of work to do, you've now got less time in which to do the other three. Additionally, universities don't seem to take fourth subjects into account very sympathetically. A\*AA becomes A\*AAA, for example, not A\*ABB or something more reasonable. You can end up in the farcical situation where you would have been accepted with three of your subjects, but because you chose to take a fourth you were rejected.

You don't want to be the one sat there on results day, rejected with A\*AAB, stood next to the person with A\*AA who was accepted to the same course.

Additionally... why bother? Assuming you're in state education you can get into any University (inc. Oxbridge) on pretty much any course with three suitably strong A levels (possibly excluding Medicine, Vet. Med. and Dentistry, and PPE/NatSci at Oxbridge). Even if it wasn't a liability, it's just a pointless extra workload. No A-Level course is that academically fascinating, if you're that interested there's always plenty of reading around the topic you can do to compensate. Your fourth subject will be a burden at best, and a liability at worst.

In case you hadn't guessed, I ended up in clearing because of my fourth subject. Which is another point - clearing really isn't the end of the world, although it will probably be the worst morning of your life.

1. Don't play injured players. Sandro wasn't fit. He shouldn't have started.

2. Put together a midfield that has some creativity in it. The problem isn't just that Liverpool passed well. It's that we passed miserably. The ball would get to either Dembele or Paulinho, and they'd stand around like they had no idea what to do. Why didn't Holtby or Sigurdsson start?

3. Whatever direction AVB has been giving our midfielders didn't appear to work. They had no idea what to do with the ball once they got it. Chadli looked ok for a while on the wing, but would cut inside (as he's supposed to), and Naughton was never behind him. If you KNOW that Naughton's a lousy player who's not good on the attack, why run an inverted winger on his side? Why not put Townsend there, where he'll stay wide and hit in crosses, and run Lamela on the other side, if you must have an inverted winger. If you cut in from the right, you at least have Walker covering for you.

So, while I don't know if those tactics would have saved us today, they certainly would have made a difference. The defense is a problem, but again, AVB refused to make tactical changes based on what he had available to him. 

I really just don't get this kneejerk defense of the guy. We don't look like a 4th place team that's gotten unlucky a couple of times and find ourselves in 6th.

I do believe that he has a long term vision for constructing a team that plays attractive and winning football, and I think he needs time to develop (and buy) the players necessary. I don't think we're in the position of say Chelsea where we can just buy managers until one is good enough, and I think he can lead a title winning side.

You can argue that our back 4 and tactics was the reason we lost today, but it wasn't; our midfield got bossed around, we got unlucky with Sandro's injury, and Paulinho got sent off. We should have gotten another LB, but I can see how we wanted to give Rose a shot and got burned by his injury, at least in the short term. We maybe should have started Fryers, but I don't think it was a forgone conclusion he would play better than Naughton.

Everybody can think of things that are wrong with the team, but frankly most of it's bs and I think we should give the guy whom we've invested in (and happens to be a pretty sharp guy) a chance to right the ship.

I don't know if your board is different, but if it's Edexcel, I cannot understate just how great the official Edexcel Core Mathematics textbooks are. It's not that they're good at teaching (they're not revision guides), but more that they distill all the core information and provide the exercises to help cement the knowledge into memory.

Worked in the past at Porto maybe, but this is not Porto and neither was Chelsea. If he wants to play a high defense then John Terry is certainly not his man. Physically, John Terry would have trouble with that. It isn't about adapting, it's about his body not being able to do it.

I thinking firing him now would be a silly, knee-jerk move, especially considering Spurs are only five points out of first place. Granted, this match was bad for them. But we lost to fucking *Hull* a couple of weeks ago; every team has bad matches every now and then.

Let's mention that Arsenal also scored 3 more than Tottenham, and that even though they conceded 6 they still fought. 

&gt;Man City at home is one of the scariest places to go nowadays, so you can't blame Spurs there.

Since November 2nd only 3 sides have failed to score at City, including CL teams. Those 3 teams are Swansea, Spurs, and Norwich. Even West Brom gave city a run for their money. It is not ""one of the scariest places to go"" by a long shot. 

&gt;You seem like the kind of guy that has knee jerk reactions whenever we have a loss as well.

-6 GD and not having a single shot on target AT HOME after spending 100million+ is knee jerk? Don't make assumptions about me when the evidence is right in front of you. 

&gt;Good players should play well regardless regardless of what their formation is.

And this is why you aren't a manager. You don't understand that some players are physically built to play a certain style of football or that they have certain roles. This isn't something where you can just slot a player into your formation that they aren't used to. Terry had been playing a different style than AVB's for as long as he had been playing, it wasn't his fault for not adapting. 

Using this logic you should be able to tell Messi to be a strong man in the box and simply go for headers. If he can't he must be a bad player.

1. Tone - Moffat set up this ""dark fairytale"" tone when he took over. It really helps Doctor Who stand out as a scifi/fantasy series.

2. Dialogue - Moffat can write the crap out of dialogue. He is utterly brilliant at it in ways that almost no other writer on television has been able to rival in recent years (and that's taking into account the utterly amazing shows that have been on in this new Golden Age of TV like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad). 

It's certainly helped that Matt is fantastic as the Doctor and that all the companions have been great (I was never a Rose fan... though she was awesome in the 50th). 

I definitely understand his shortcomings as a writer (""love conquers all"" is a theme he overuses, but, to be fair, the Doctor's whole thing is ""words win wars"" so it fits tonally). But I think the show, overall, improved quite a bit when he took over as show runner.

1: The executive is unelected. Of course others counteract that they are appointees of elected governments, but that does appear to be flimsy ground- where you'd accept the government appointing say a police chief or general who implements the law, you'd likely never accept them appointing the person who makes it. 

2: The elected body, the European Parliament, does not have legislative initiative- they can't propose laws, merely amend them or debate them in committee.

3: Low voter turnout- heading below the 40% threshold indicates a lack of outcome legitimacy- winning with 40% of 70% of voters already makes people question the democratic validity of a result. Getting 40% of 40% is a different question altogether.

4: Lack of accessibility and transparency- most Europeans don't know their MEP and don't see the inner workings of the EU. Although most people would say that its the people's fault for not working harder to access this information, it is another symptom of legitimacy- if people en masse don't engage with the body, it is a tacit lack of consent.

5: The ability of heads of government to decide the trajectory of the EU. Much of what happens is still pushed by national heads of government- although they are heads of elected governments themselves, it is still limiting to the institution as a democratic body in its own right to have those of another constituency affect its trajectory.

6: The suspension of democracy in Italy and Greece for technocratic heads of government in response to the euro crisis. Mario Monti did a fine job, but it was a terrifying development for western democracy that those outside Italy could determine, even for a prescribed period, the members of its government.

7: The EU supporting Orban's Hungary and accepting its transition away from core democratic principles, and Ponta's violating the Romanian constitution. 

8: In the name of supporting the euro tacitly allowing economic and social instability in Greece, allowing the conditions by which, historically, anti-democratic parties thrive in Europe- hence the advent of Golden Dawn.

9: Ignoring referenda in Ireland and France when it goes against the wishes of the political class.

10: Although as another user noted, ever-closer union was there right from the Treaty of Rome, key constitutional changes have taken place, including the fundamental constitution itself, the name of the organisation, its borders and its hard and soft power. In a democratically accountable nation state these changes would likely have necessitated referenda or a constitutional convention. Imagine if the Faroe Islands and Iceland wanted to join the UK, or if the government decided that the country was to change the shape of its legislature/executive and that we would become a tri-cameral state, or that we were changing the name of the country to marmiteland, or things of that order- in the name of democracy most people would demand an unequivocal referendum.

So I think those are some of the reasons why. They are just jumping-off points, not fully developed arguments, but they are some of the legions of issues that people cite.",0,1387168700,null,0,false,0,ce2swos,t3_1sxeoj,t1_ce2swos,t1_ce2lasa,null,1428113874,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5
true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"&gt; serious plaudits like possibly best player in erevedisie?

Being the best player in the Dutch First Division *is* a serious accolade, but not one Piazon has earned as of yet. Consider the fact that Kevin De Bruyne won Bundesliga Young Player of the Year last season and is riding the at Chelsea.

[I used Hazard as an example because of his CV from Lille, and his individual honours earned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Hazard#Honours). He jumped right into the first team when he came to Chelsea.

&gt; and scoring or assisting at better then 1 per game. 

The season isn't over yet. Let's not jump the shark, consistency matters over the course of the whole season.

The beginning of the season was strange, teams would sit back and let us show of our lack of end product until we eventually got lucky with a penalty so our defense looked awesome. Teams have started to take advantage of our defensive limitations and our end product hasn't gotten any better. As AVB has said, our form in EL has been more impressive and prolific in front of goal, but we aren't really seeing that translate into the Premier League. 

The biggest thing I'm concerned about personally going forward this season is that we've seriously overhauled our side. Spurs have become a core of young players who will possibly never fulfill their potential while playing here, but they've been given a shot. I've seen a lot of the changes AVB has made as building blocks to a very strong, versatile side in coming years. I fear that we underestimated just how much rebuilding we were looking for.

true,HPB,eng-durham,Durham,"&gt; No offence, but your understanding of addiction honestly reminds me of something Peter Hitchens said, almost verbatim.

My understanding of addiction comes from evidence provided first hand by addicts. Perhaps you aren't the sole font of knowledge on this and not all addicts are the same ?

&gt;To say people choose to be addicted by taking addictive drugs 

I don't say this. I say people choose to take drugs. And come on in this day and age people *know* that drugs can lead to addiction. It's naive in the extreme to suggest that all addicts are victims of circumstance whereby they become addicted without their actions contributing to their circumstances.

We're clearly at opposite ends of the spectrum here. You think that addicts who commit crime should be helped in psychiatric hospitals. The end point here is one of addicts being sectioned against their will so that they get the help they need. Are you willing for this to happen - forcing people into mental health hospitals where they don't want to be ?

I think that people need to take responsibility for their own actions. I'm sure you think that addicts are incapable of this. The lady had been sentenced by the court to get regular help from Probation. She chose not to take it. Yet she was lucid enough to be able to commit further crime.

I've been confirmed a number of times (more so privately) privately AND a couple of times publicly by the mods but everynow and then somebody will have a problem because THEY never saw the comment or the verification and so it's '*because i never saw it I dont believe it'* and when I was made a mod I told the other mods everything about myself so I promise you and everybody if i wasnt who i say i was they would have taken me down and out a LOOONG time ago, mind you ive been on the sub almost/maybe 2 years now (*as Elevenreds).. 

I get a lot of where and when but I was verified for being in the [academy in my first AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/10oj01/elevenreds_amaa/c6fieqf?context=3)

Im struggling to find other posts because (1) I cant remember what the titles of the posts were + there are a LOT of comments to dig through as they were made by a mod and not myself (under a different Elevenreds account at the time) (2) the internal search engine is pretty bad and it makes finding things difficult (3) I don't want to publicly show any of my docs, official forms or emails incase somebody uses the information or blabs and the club finds out and then they go trawling through to work out who i am and from the bits of personal info ive given out it wouldnt take them long to figure it out (4) like the mods I get asked SO MANY TIMES a week that I just ignore the questions now..

also I've said a couple of times they used to come on out and say yep, he's cool but because of the amount of times a week they get asked now they just ignore them (you have no idea just how many they get..) they know Im legit and thats all the matters in my mind and their minds at the end of the day, if they didnt believe me or have had me verified a few times they would have banned blocked me a long time ago

The Ice Hockey, Not as good as the hockey you guys have but our team (The Bradford Sabres) are pretty decent. They start the season a fe weeks into term, usually on a Thursday night. It's free to go watch and you can bring in your own alcohol. Keep an eye out if you do go for the bunch of scruffy punks slamming on the plexiglass. That'll be me and my mates. Speaking of punk

The 1in12 club: This is a bit tricky to find but if you ask around you should be able to track it down. It's an anarchist punk bar run collectively by it's members. It has a gig floor, bar, cafe and library. Beers cheap and so are the gigs (which are awesome) it's also cheap to join as a member and have a say in what goes on at the club or even volunteer for the bar if your looking to get some experience under your belt. (plus it doesn't count as working so no possible visa issues, and the £20 bar tab per nights work really helps save money)

As far as food goes: CURRY! it's pretty much all good. Other places of honourable mention would be Oasis for really good burgers (Try the double western burger) or Mystic Pizza next door for some of the best pizza in the city centre. 

As for general tips, I'd say just be careful at night walking around on your own. The city isn't as bad as people make out but that still doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.

A huge tell for AVB's frantic approach was Lamela at the Arsenal game. Now, I think Lamela is awesome, and he's going to be an amazing player once he becomes acclimated. But he had just crossed the channel when AVB, in a desperate final ten minutes threw him on the field to get a miracle.

Maybe Lucas didn't play his best but he did we he needed to do, protecting the back four well and dropping deep between Skrtel and Sahko (New SAS??) to recycle possession. 

Gerrard's injury is unfortunate because of his creation, dangerous set pieces, and mere presence on the pitch but on the other hand Allen now has a chance to prove himself and has done admirably so far. He's gotten better every game and was superb in all aspects against Spurs today. He's playing his preferred position and having the confidence of Lucas behind him has him going forward more and he has looked dangerous. 

Sterling has gotten better every game as well. If it wasn't for a certain Uruguayan, he'd have been my man of the match. He was scintillating when running with the ball and the way he seems to glide at a full sprint is a joy to watch. The critics say he lacks strength but he used his body well today, pressed effectively and always looked to do something positive in position. Can't wait to see what type of player he'll become.

FTFY.  People are going to complain no matter who is running the show.  It is human nature.

Doctor Who is the type of show that leads people to become emotionally vested because by necessity we have to use our imagination to fill in many of the blanks and ambiguities inherent in the production of the show.  Every fan develops their own little Doctor Who universe that they perceive in their own way, and it is natural to get defensive when those perceptions are challenged.

The problem is the diversity of those perceptions.  You can see it even in this subreddit, where everyone can watch the same given episode yet have wildly diverging opinions of what happened and what it means.

Nobody is going to be able to please all of the people all of the time, and the people that disapprove are far more vocal than those who have no issue.

It's testament to the popularity of the show that people would actually care.  Yet regardless of who is running the show, some people will always complain.  The vast majority of fans likely don't care.

true,bustanuttson,null,null,"To be honest this is as big for them as Suarez getting injured. He's the only one who looks like he could compete with Luis for the golden boot this season and he has simply been unstoppable all year. His link-up with Negredo this year has been devastating teams, especially at the Etihad and playing Dzeko/Negredo as a pair is much less scary. The main threat will come from Nasri and Silva, and it's up to Hendo and Allen to close them down quickly and the defense to keep track of their darting runs. We know we can play with them, Lucas always relishes playing against Yaya and raises his game to a new level, allowing the Ivorian little space and frustrating him going forward. 

Their defense is far from what it was under Mancini, with Kompany in and out of the squad all year and Demichelis(sp?), Nastasic, and Lescott look far from convincing. Even if an average game for the City captain is a terrific game for anyone else, he is not yet back to his best. Zabaleta is class, he could play on any team in the world no problem, he's right up there with Baines, Johnson, and Cole, maybe even a step above.

Regardless, with the team in this form and Suarez scoring goals whenever he wants, it should be a cracking match. Let's beat Cardiff first though!

1.  Don't play Paulinho at CAM when he has lousy close control, always takes 1-2 touches too many, frequently mishits passes, and couldn't put a shot on target to save his life.

2.  Don't play a high defensive line against one of the speediest and trickiest attacking trios in the EPL, particularly when you've got one guy as a makeshift CB (Capoue), one guy as a poor makeshift LB (Naughton), and a guy who would struggle to keep pace with Gerrard, let alone Suarez (Dawson).

3.  Don't sell one of your most promising young CBs in Caulker in favour of retaining two older guys who now struggle with pace and fitness in Dawson and Kaboul.

4.  Stop playing 4-2-3-1 when it hasn't once looked convincing in the league this season.

5.  Don't leave out our highest scorer from open play in the EPL (Siggy) and our most unpredictable attacking threat (Townsend) without obvious reason.

100% agree that 15 goals in 14 games isn't great, but it's a positive GD (excluding the big two of course), so it doesn't seem like such a big worry for me. I'm more of an NUFC fan, and even we haven't scored more than 2 in any game, and we've conceded more goals (22) more consistantly. 4-0 on the opening day and have conceded 3 three times. Yet we also have 27 points.

You can't expect to whack a ton of players together and expect instant return. Look at City. August 2008, they get taken over and instantly money starts going out. 08/09 season, 10th place. Following season, they go up to 5th. Then 3rd. Then finally 1st. You just lost your top player, and have replaced him with quite a few. Lamela hardly seems to play, Eriksen was injured, now seemingly your entire centre defence is injured, players are having to play out of position like Capoue. If there's one thing an NUFC fan can tell you, is that injurys can seriously hinder a season.

You mention Fulham. Meulensteen comes in, first game loses to you. Then they beat a middle of the table side Villa, before getting tanked by Everton at the weekend. Even if they are playing a bit better, the results are hardly there so far.

You have a EL winner at the helm, who learned his trade from arguably one of the best current managers around. Who would be a step up that you could get? Just looking at the ""AVB Gone?"" thread, and I'm failing to see any names that could replace him, and do a better job.

Capello is the favourite? England played decent defensive football, but my god were we dreary to watch. On top of that he has the World Cup coming up next summer. De Boer won't leave Ajax mid season, and I would bet Laudrup is exactly the same at Swansea. Tim Sherwood? Would you want to put faith in a guy with no managerial experience, over an EL winner?

AVB's win percentage is not only inflated due to fluky wins, but also thanks to a fellow named Gareth Bale. We got Baled out a dozen times last season. If he hadn't had the best player in the premiership on his team, we would have ended up in like eighth place (if that).  

Is it AVB's fault? Well, take a look at the team: Soldado is a 25 goal scorer in Spain. This season, he can barely put it in the net. Lamela is a 15 goal scorer in Italy. This season, he doesn't even get the start. We have a top flight goalie, one top flight defender (Jan), a top flight fullback (Walker), a top flight DM (Sandro), good midfielders who have been successful elsewhere in Eriksen, Holtby, and Sigurdsson, and yet, we can't score goals.

As I asked alexropo earlier, why are you so bad at scoring goals in the league, but doing considerably better in the EL? What changes? You look so much more comfortable in attack. Surely Anzhi aren't that much worse than say, Cardiff or Sunderland?

I guess there's an argument that maybe too many of the players are coming from overseas, and aren't used to the English game. The Spanish game is much different to ours, so Soldado definitely needs to adapt. Chadli and Eriksen from the Dutch league, a switch that has proved to be unsuccessful on a number of occasions, \*cough\* Afonso Alves. Paulinho from Corinthians, I'm sure any Bayern fan on /r/soccer will tell you buying from Brazil is risky. As for Vlad, I know a decent amount about most leagues, but my knowledge of the Romanian league is akin to my knowledge of fine Venezuelan wines.

I'll be honest, I don't like Bale. Never did. He's a quality player, I just don't like him. But you look at his stats, his best season was undeniably the season under AVB. He brought that out in him. I remember a heat graph from the last 3 seasons for Bale on a pitch, and AVB had him playing a much freer role. He can get the best out of a player, but the player needs to find their feet first. Bale had 5 seasons under Redknapp to get used to the league and everything, Soldado has had 4 months maybe?

I think you ask some interesting questions, but ultimately, stats don't really tell the whole story.  I think most of us are really bothered by the manner of our play more than anything.  If we were scraping wins by one goal and having the odd thrashing, but otherwise playing attractive, enterprising football (as we did under Redknapp), then I think most of us would let AVB off the hook given the young, mostly new squad.

But we're not.  AVB has taken a side that came 4th, 5th and 4th in the previous three campaigns and turned them into a mid-table side that's lucky to be where it is.  Other teams feared us when the season started and played cautiously against us, but now everyone realises we're toothless.  Opposition teams are happy to give us the lion's share of possession because we never do anything meaningful with it.  And yet every time we lose the ball, we're scrambling to cover counter-attacks and look vulnerable at nearly every opportunity.

It was always going to be a hard start to the campaign due to losing Bale at the last minute and having so many new faces.  But AVB has a very strict ideal in terms of formation and tactics that simply isn't suited to the personnel now at his disposal.  He has started with the exact same 4-2-3-1 formation in every EPL game this season even though it's not once looked convincing.

It's fine to take time figuring out your best starting XI and how to best use your players.  Look at Giroud's lacklustre first season last year, and how he's now playing like a totally different man.  But from what I've seen so far, AVB has no ability to react to circumstances or results to coax a good performance.  He was sacked by Chelsea for being too dogmatic and unyielding in his managerial style, and he's going to fall on the same sword here.

I think in some ways he's a victim of having extraordinary success at the first real attempt with a very specific system at Porto, and he now believes that the system was the reason, not the set of players or specific circumstances of that season.  He's been trying to recreate that Porto team at Chelsea and now here with us, but they are totally different teams.

I believe he is a very intelligent, strong-willed man, but just not old or mature enough to know how to man manage.  And that really is a more important attribute than having the best tactical plans in the world.  It's why Ferguson's champions from last season are now playing like shit, and why Di Matteo can take AVB's failures and turn them around to become double trophy winners in the space of the same season.",0,1387177736,null,0,false,0,ce2vsmq,t3_1szi81,t1_ce2vsmq,t3_1szi81,null,1428112523,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

I would wholeheartedly recommend the OU to anyone, the courses are well-written, up to date and interesting. All the courses I've been on have had regular evening tutorial sessions where you have the opportunity to meet up with other students. Depending on the course these were sometimes quite local (at the nearby FE college) but other times quite a bit further away (central London, for example -- I live right at the edge of Greater London). The tutorials were optional but highly recommended, both to increase understanding and to meet others doing the course.

But additional to that the OU has invested heavily in online learning technology, and there are messageboards set up on its own website for every course. This is also a great way to meet other students following the course and we were encouraged to make contact and meet up in person for study support, if that's what we wanted. If it's a popular course there will probably be an unofficial Facebook group as well.

In terms of process it couldn't have been simpler. Sign up on their website and pay the money, then about 4-6 weeks before the course begins the textbooks will arrive in the post. The course pages on the OU website have a study planner telling you what chapters you should be studying each week, and giving you the deadline dates for each assignment (which can usually be submitted online).

I can't answer the bit about employers because I haven't done sufficient modules with the OU to get any bits of paper from them. But I've thoroughly enjoyed every course that I've taken, and learned a lot well, which meant they fulfilled my expectations.

Lacking the final product is painful, but I enjoy the build up. It may not be akin to say, Arsenal, or even Swansea, but I enjoy it. But that's obviously subjective. I also feel you're a bit unlucky to be 7th just down to how many other teams are playing amazingly this season. Everton are playing brilliantly under Martinez, and NUFC have found their form of 2 seasons ago again. Hooray for no injury crisis.

I see people talk about stale tactics, but I had never realised that it was always the same 4-2-3-1. It's a formation I like (however sad that sounds), but if it doesn't work it doesn't work. 

Soldado has certainly been a bit mediocre, but is Defoe any better? I look at the squad, and I can't help but wonder, where exactly are your goals meant to come from? Soldado is the obvious choice, but beyond that? Defoe hasn't scored 20+ since 2010, and 134 (47) isn't mind blowing really. Lamela only has 115 (26) across all competitions. The midfield is certainly capable of scoring, and from range, but not on a constant basis like Ramsey is doing. It seems to me that you're almost putting all your eggs in one basket. Is a striker needed come January?

The biggest problem I foresee if he is sacked, is who comes in? As I said earlier,

&gt;Capello is the favourite? England played decent defensive football, but my god were we dreary to watch. On top of that he has the World Cup coming up next summer. De Boer won't leave Ajax mid season, and I would bet Laudrup is exactly the same at Swansea. Tim Sherwood? Would you want to put faith in a guy with no managerial experience, over an EL winner?

I don't personally believe RDM is the man to do the job either. It felt to me like he was able to lift Chelsea because of who he was, rather than his ability, and that then wore off a bit after the summer.",0,1387178966,null,0,false,0,ce2w39a,t3_1szi81,t1_ce2w39a,t1_ce2vsmq,null,1428112386,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

We drive on the correct side of the road, and are more aggressive as drivers. DO NOT drive round London if you've never driven in the UK before, you will die horribly. (Exaggeration I know, but I'm from the north, driven around London once and swore Id never do It again)

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I think the only thing that may keep AVB in the job a little longer is a lack of an immediate candidate.  I've said many times before Bielsa could be the man for the job... he has a clear vision, works well with hungry, young teams blessed with potential and pace, and is an attacking monster.  He is arguably the most influential manager in world football in the last decade, as Guardiola's Barca were modelled explicitly after Bielsa's teams.  The other candidates being bandied about leave me cold however.  I would love someone like Antonio Conte or Klopp, but there's no way they're going to leave their posts for us.

To answer your first paragraph, there are a lot of teams playing well right now, but it's also the most open league we've seen in a long time.  With Man Utd bottoming out (although I expect them to recover), anyone in the top 10 really can beat anyone else.  Even teams like Man City and Chelsea have lost surprising games.  This season's top four spot is there for the taking, but we keep shooting ourselves in the foot.

And in terms of goals, part of the reason Soldado has looked poor and lost confidence is entirely down to the way AVB has set the team up.  Soldado is an old fashioned penalty box poacher, like Ruud Van Nistelrooy.  He should not be required to set up goals, drop deep, do any defensive work, or roam the wings.  He needs fast, direct service into his feet.  Either sharp, incisive passes through the defence, or crosses to his feet coming from the byline.  But instead, AVB has persisted with two inverted wingers (most often Townsend on the right, and Chadli or Siggy on the left), who necessarily need to cut inside onto their stronger foot.  It only serves to congest the already tight centre of the park, and forces our team into far too many pot shots from outside the box, because there's no room to slip the ball to Soldado.

To get the best out of him, we need fast wingers running to the byline and firing crosses towards the six yard box.  Soldado thrives on those kinds of opportunities, and without them he looks lost.  AVB's current system works best either with a big, bustling centre forward, like Benteke or Negredo (both of whom we pursued well before we landed on Soldado), who can hold up play, knock the ball down to onrushing midfielders, and use his strength and size to create havoc... or with a tricky, fast CF, like Aguero or Suarez.  Those two use their clever positioning, close control and turn of pace to constantly unlock defences.  Soldado unfortunately fits into neither box.

I think Soldado is a good player suffering from a bad system.  A new manager might figure out how to service him, and restore his confidence.  A new manager is necessarily the golden bullet to all of our problems, but I've lost faith in AVB having the answers for now.",0,1387185132,null,0,false,0,ce2x9wf,t3_1szi81,t1_ce2x9wf,t1_ce2w39a,null,1428111833,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5
true,Perihelion_,null,null,"/r/iwantout can help you with specific things necessary to potentially moving, which is far from simple for US citizens or anyone outside of the EU. Visas, employment, etc is a total minefield and one wrong step can see you refused entry, deported or even banned from returning at all for years. Having skills and qualifications that are extremely good, or extremely in demand (as in there's a continental shortage of people with said skills), will help. Finding work with a multinational that has a presence in the UK is a start, but again you'd need to show it's worth their while to get you through all the legal faff and transfer you a UK location. Sorry if it sounds harsh but it's better to know what you'd have to go through than labour under a false idea that it'll be easy.

On accents - just no. Everyone can immediately spot all but the very best fakes, and will find it funny (best case scenario), or condescending and annoying (worst case). If you do come over and end up staying, most people won't mind your accent (By which I mean they will mercilessly insult you for it at every given opportunity, if they're any good mates at all), and you'll pick phrases and stuff up naturally. Much better than trying to force it.

As for cultural titbits, the differences between rhe UK and US, aside from a few things on the political side, are mostly little things. Lots and lots of little things that change dependinh who you ask, where they live, how they grew up, how rich/poor/educated/well travelled/race/ they are, what football club they support, what newspaper they read... You get it. It'd be impossible to draw a nice neat line and say ""this sums up England"" without making a generalisation so broad that it loses all meaning.


 last of all, if/when you finally go for it, good luck! For the most part, despite what it may seem, we're pretty welcoming on the whole, unless you the type to talk on public transport or something.

I was actually taken aback by our midfield domination, I thought that was the one place Spurs would have the edge over us with their big powerful players. The opposite happened, it was men against boys in there, with the Spurs players being taken to school.

His constant well timed runs, passing, link up play, finishing all first rate.

His passing and runs were what impressed me most, of course he's always that tenacious player, but yesterday he took that to the next level. I think his passing came on another level too. There were some beautiful passes, a couple in particular. One curling ball blind pass out to Coutinho which was world class and of course the nutmeg back heel which allowed Suarez to cross for the Flanno goal. If he plays like that every week he'll become a 'top, top, top player.'

Seriously though, I was so happy for him. A well deserved man of the match performance. Long may this form of his continue.",0,1387185751,null,0,1387189161,0,ce2xdgm,t3_1szpbi,t1_ce2xdgm,t3_1szpbi,null,1428111787,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

The police were bang on to remove them from an occupation of a private building, especially when they were preventing people coming and going freely.
No doubt they made them selves look like saints compared to the tirrany of the police officers who came and brutally removed them from what was their god given right (and by that I mean give someone who no count stepped out of line a bit of a slap.) 


From what I've witnessed first hand, student protests are rarely of a worthy cause, more often than not its a bunch of moronic kids 'fighting the power, man.'

But I just can't see it happening. People say that it takes time to build a team, but the problem is that we look worse now than when he took over. I hate his tactics. We play boring, boring football and rarely score goals. He's spent over 100m on attacking players and yet rarely commits to attacking football.

true,zerodius,num9-away,,"This post summarizes my frustrations about misuse of Soldado more articulately than I ever could. I'm a more casual fan and only have started following Tottenham this year. Lots of young, promising new stars joined this team after Bale's departure and I thought this team would be an exciting, attacking football club on most of their outings. Needless to say that it has been very disappointing. 

What's also been irritating about watching this club (in the limited games I have been able to watch, as I am out in Asia and games are often on at  1-2 AM) is that the central midfield disappears completely for long stretches. Whether it be Paulinho, Dembele or Sandro, there are 10-20 minute periods where the ball simply cannot advance through them, either because they are getting so easily dispossessed or forced to push the ball elsewhere because of pressure. This often leads to in errant long passes from the back four, a futile Townsend run or Soldado having to move out of position to receive the ball and therefore putting him far away from the area of the pitch where he has a legitimate chance of scoring. 

The problem isn't that the team doesn't always play well. It's that there are recurring problems that are leading to poor results, yet there have been no noticeable attempts to change things (formation/personnel/whatever else that a manager could try).

When a manager fancies his club to be a contender, drop points to weak teams and get blown out 6-0 or 5-0 to teams you need to beat to be in the running for the top 4, and yet don't even make any visible attempt to shake things up after such colossal failures, it's hard not to wonder whether that manager is deserving of the job. 

I really do hope things improve going forward, and there are still a lot of games left to play. But I honestly don't know how many games AVB has left if things remain the way they are at present.

I think big Sam's first 11 is too predictable. We have great wingers crossing the ball to mediocre strikers that don't fight, and when they do, are not good at finishing. Our defence is shaky without Reidy, and our opposition knows this. Either Tonks or Collins has got to step up and take charge marshalling that back four. We have lost a lot of leadership at the back since Reid's injury. 

I think we need to start Jack Collison on the right instead of Joe Cole and play 4-4-2 instead of 4-2-3-1. If we play Collison and Jarvis as LM and RM instead of LW and RW, we can stick Carlton up top with Rav playing as a second striker in the hole.

true,threesquares,null,null,"Right now I'm working through a BA History degree with the OU and absolutely love it. 

I've completed one module, and I'm doing the (relatively unusual) process of doing my degree full time, i.e. two modules at once rather than one at a time. The OU is designed to be part time, so most other OU students I talk to look rather startled when I tell them I'm doing two modules concurrently, but it's working reasonably well so far. That means it'll take me three years to complete, and most students take 6. 

The sign up process is incredibly simple - you just pick a module, pay your fees or apply for student finance and then that's you registered to start. There's no applications, which is why it's called the Open University. Anyone can do it. I find the age range of students is generally higher, from late twenties through to retired people looking to keep the grey matter moving. 

There are a few different ways to go about qualifications. You can either do the odd module as and when you like, do enough modules in whatever subjects you feel like to qualify for an Open Degree (i.e. you've made up a certain number of credits), or follow a pathway to recieve a particular degree - History in my case, English Literature in yours. You get the flexibility of choosing a wider range of modules in the Open degree, whereas with pathway ones there are certain compulsory modules at each level that you need to take. I've done one compulsory module at level 1 (AA100, the Arts Past and Present, which you would also have to take, and which I loved), working through one at Level 2 (A200, History Medieval to Modern), and I'm doing an optional one at L2 as well (A219, Classical Greece and Rome). 

I have (roughly) monthly assessments for each course called TMAs (Tutor Marked Assignments), which the OU gradually builds from 500 words up to 2500+ words. Some courses have an exam at the end, some have EMAs (End of Module Assignments) which are externally marked. One thing that I do particularly like about the OU is that they gradually build your confidence and academic ability. You start with easy, short assignments and through the course it increases, so by the end you're doing full academic essays with bibliographies and essay plans and they seem as straightforward as the first TMA did. They really, really do support you, especially as most people are coming into the modules with a huge gap between the last time they wrote an academic essay for school and now! 

As /u/buried_treasure said, you do get plenty of contact with other students. There are monthly tutorials in your local area, plus one or two days schools during each course, and online forums both through the OU and Facebook. I find my FB course forum more active and interesting, but it does vary. Your tutor will also get in contact with their email and phone numbers, so you can get in touch at any time to ask them questions. I've actually had friends from brick unis tell me that OU students get more tutor support than they do!

As far as employers go, I think OU degrees are regarded quite highly. Even though anyone can do one, they are academically rigorous and most people do their degree whilst also having other full time commitments like employment and families to work around. It shows you can multi-task, but you *have* to be dedicated to get through it. I don't have any kind of social life at all right now, but I am handing in all my assignments on time and getting quite good marks for them. I also love the courses, and I'm so pleased I signed up to them. Definitely give it a go!

true,ladfrombrad,eng-yorkshire,bradford.reddit.com,"As someone else says here, Opera runs your traffic through their servers with ""Off Road Mode""

&gt;Q: What is Off-Road mode?

&gt;Off-Road mode uses the cloud-based compression technology from the Opera Mini browser. This has some advantages and some drawbacks.

&gt;On slow and unreliable networks, Off-Road mode loads pages significantly faster than the normal browsing mode.
&gt;Data usage is significantly reduced and can be adjusted by changing the image quality setting.
&gt;On slower devices, page rendering and scrolling can be faster.
&gt;Some dynamic website features might not work flawlessly in Off-Road mode due to its architecture.

&gt;Q: Is Off-Road mode secure?

&gt;The traffic between your device and our servers is encrypted when browsing secure webpages. However, the cloud-based compression technology utilized by Off-Road mode needs to have access to the unencrypted version of the webpage in order to compress the data. Therefore, no strict end-to-end encryption between the client and the remote web server is possible.

&gt;If you need full end-to-end encryption, simply disable Off-Road mode in the main menu.

&gt;If you do not trust Opera Software, make sure you do not use Off-Road mode to transmit any kind of sensitive information.

The tutorials were helpful if you were able to attend - they tried to get as close as possible.

Downsides were that unfortunately I don't feel my particular course covered enough of a first year at the Uni I am at now would have done. Cannot speak for other courses. Another was that for projects with other people, you cannot guarantee people will join in at all, and getting hold of them can be hard.

I would recommend OU to anyone really, if you want to work full time (or part time) and get some qualifications.

2 As I have said before, the Bank of England provides liquidity and guarantees to various essential parts of the UK banking system. It does not do that to foreign banks for the obvious reason that they are outside the control of the UK.

3 As you say, an 'independent' Scotland could operate without Scottish banks and everyone could bank offshore (by which I mean the rest of the UK). I am sure the UK banks would take sterling deposits from Scotland. Whether they would lend any money to the Scots (i.e to residents of a foreign country) is less certain.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"Yeah, you are totally right about our midfield.  We have limited ability to move the ball through the centre of the park.

There are a number of issues why I think this is the case.  I think using two defensive CMs (two of Dembele/Paulinho/Capoue/Sandro) who aren't keen distributors is a problem.  They can break up play, but invite pressure too much by slowing passing down and always playing the predictable ball.

I think we also have massive issues with the way we move out of the back.  Nearly every time Lloris gets the ball, he looks to throw it short to a defender.  But too often Walker and whoever is playing on the left push high up the park as though Lloris is going to punt it down field.  He rarely does this.  Instead, he tosses it to one of the CBs, and then you've got two men stranded near our goal with the ball.  With no one in midfield moving to create passing options, they get stuck too many times with no one to pass to other than perhaps one of the CDMs.  It's so monotonous and predictable that teams now know to swarm us as soon as Lloris releases the ball, as fast midfielders can easily surround our 2-3 defensive players with five attackers with lightning speed.  And then we're screwed.

The biggest single issue however is just having a very static midfield.  We have a whole team of players who have very specific roles and instructions within the formation.  Wingers, run up and down the sidelines when you're not cutting inside, CDMs, hold your position, CAM, just walk about a bit, and that's it.

The best modern attacking teams in the EPL all have multiple fast, technically proficient midfielders changing positions at will.  Fluidity is the new gospel, and Man City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal do it brilliantly.  Each one of those sides start multiple creative players who roam between the lines and rotate with each other across the pitch horizontally.  We don't.

We have no player who seeks to position himself consistently between the opposition back line and midfield line, and so there are no good passes through the lines to be made.  Usually Soldado himself ends up drifting out to that zone, which sucks because it means he's then usually boxed in by two big CDMs and two big CBs who easily muscle him off the ball and smother him.  As soon as Eriksen comes back, we need him to position himself in there, and then we need to get him the ball.  I've said a number of times I'd like to see Holtby play in one of our CDM slots, as he has the energy to close attacks down (if not quite the defensive discipline), but more importantly, he has a better range of passing than Sandro, Dembele and Paulinho.  He often tries to play positive balls forward, and if we have true wingers stretching the play wide and Eriksen finding space in the middle, Holtby is the man who could find him.

Instead, at the moment all we seem to do is pass the ball sideways and backwards.  It's slow, predictable, killing our attacks and inviting constant pressure on our defence.",0,1387191560,null,0,false,0,ce2y8bd,t3_1szi81,t1_ce2y8bd,t1_ce2xlmd,null,1428111387,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Mind you that this isn't a regular thing, This happens once in a blue moon. If the store is running low on something or doesn't have anything, the shift manager assesses the stock. Depending on the day of trade and rush, the shift manager notifies all employees (CSR)  and if he's leaving he lets the next shift manager know about the levels of stocks) about the items they have to avoid taking orders for by letting them know that they're out of it.

Saying that, you cannot say no to the person who orders online and already paid in full without the knowledge of stock availabiility. In cases like these the store resorts to purchasing stock from other stores (Dominos) and ultimately if it isn't available, they resort to super markets.

Why doesn't anyone realise that ""children aren't pissed all day"" so why the hell would they be stoned? Personally I believe that there should be a minimum age of 21, not 18 due to avoiding any teenager heavily smoking and becomming a bag head whilst their mind and body is still developing (unless research points out that it has no effect, we need legalisation to have proper research).

At the moment (despite not being able to this weekend, myself) you can ring up a guy, ask for a certain amount and either go round to said guys house or he will drive to yours, you do the deal, no questions asked have a nice chat if you've got a polite and friendly dealer and then go on your way. Dealers don't give a shit about I.D but the government sure as hell will do.

However I get the feeling that the vast majority of redditors are either smokers themselves or are in favour of legalisation, so I get the feeling this comments section is just preaching to the choir.

He was also an important factor in developing Bale into one of the world's best players, even if he left.

I really liked AVB, he was a classy and intelligent bloke who you could see was trying desperately to make things work. But I don't know how much longer I could have watched the football we played under him, truly shocking at times.

I look forward to a manager who can get us playing free-flowing football, but I lament the opportunity we have seemed to miss. There was a period when Rodgers, AVB and Martinez were all up for grabs, and we have appeared to pick the dud. 

In all, I was a big fan of AVB and I wish him nothing but the best. People will talk about knee jerks, but this was not a snap decision.

Firstly, AVB didn't lead us to our best EPL points total last season... Bale did.  AVB did little to earn that position outside of tell the best player we've had since Gazza to do his thing.  We were poor last season, but saved from mid-table mediocrity by some ludicrous goals.

We've only regressed this season.  Bale is a big loss, and yes we've got a new squad, but those excuses can only fly for so long.

We still cannot string more than a handful of meaningful passes together.  Players don't pass and move.  Selections are baffling, rotation is used counter-intuitively.  We've persisted with tactics such as inverted wingers and a high back line, despite them being obvious failings in nearly every game we've played.  Vertonghen has been overused to the point where he's now injured at a crucial juncture.  Paulinho has started every EPL game for us despite making little impact.  Siggy gets dropped despite being our top scorer from open play in the league.

Injuries happen, but AVB didn't know how to get the best out of the players he has.  Even in the midweek Europa thrashing, he uses Townsend on the left to devastating effect in the first half, but then bafflingly switches him the right for the second, where he was anonymous.  AVB had no clue what his best starting XI was, and never seemed to come up with any solutions to the team's glaring problems.

So even taking into account the different number of tobacco vs cannabis smokers in the UK and their different consumption patterns, it's still easy to see that legalised cannabis could easily bring **b**illions of pounds of tax revenue to the economy.  And that's before we even look at the savings from the War on Drugs.

So, although yes we've been spending money we haven't even been spending as much as we're getting in from selling our best and/or useful players. And the players we're getting in can't be just AVBs picks or you've got to ask what on earth Baldini is doing. 

AVB may well not know his best XI but can anyone honestly say they do? We have so many players who can do a job in the final third of the pitch who aren't turning in performances. On paper you can put 8/9 midfielders in the same few positions and no one could really question you.

Going back to transfers sure we did buy Chiriches but why sell Caulker if after a few injuries we have to start playing Defensive Midfielders as Centre Backs. And why let BAE out on loan if we're so equally screwed at Left Back. 

Sure AVB may not always have made the best decisions (Naughton -&gt; Fryers at HT v Liverpool a perfect example - why not just start Fryers there?) and the play hasn't been all that great to watch all season but when you're trying to bed in pretty much an entirely new team I don't think anyone would have got it right immediately.

AVB turned down PSG in the summer to, for the first time in his career, manage a club for back to back seasons and this is how we pay him back? Who on earth are we going to get in now that's going to be better than him? I hear Di Canio is out of a job?!!?

With that said, I have always stood by AVB and supported him, after the Man C defeat and even after yesterday's nightmare which was worse than the 2x yellows Crouch pulled off in CL a few years back. However, I am curious to see what the future has in store for us, whether it is in a few weeks, next season or even after that (remember our young and unadapted squad guys).

The answer to the first question is probably no and the answer to the second question is certainly no.

Firstly, I generally feel that everyone has been rather hoodwinked by AVB's success with a Porto squad that were a lock regardless. 

It become apparent after his time here, that he wasnt yet up to the standard he needed to be. 

This was already made perfectly clear during his time here with us and so Spurs definately knew what they were getting and should really have stuck with him if they had any idea what they were doing by hiring him in the first place. 

Losing to a currently rampant Man City, and Suarez FC weren't completely unexpected results. Look at how badly arsenal were dismantled for long patches. 

The other side to me is, AVB was so stubborn with his tactics to the point of arrogance. 

Everyone talks about the high line defending, which is one part. 

But they haven't scored any goals to negate that either. 

Soldado has been a certified dud in terms of open play goalscoring so far - yet Defoe still could barely get a look in.

Anyone who has worked in a pub over Christmas knows that if you want to take that time off then it needs to be approved weeks, if not months, in advance.

If I was running a pub (and I'll be the first to admit I'm not) then I'd have said no too.

The conversation probably went like this:

Chef, 10 days before Christmas day: Can I take Christmas day off?  
Boss: We're running a special Christmas day menu, we've been taking bookings for weeks, so no  
Chef: I have a family I'd like to spend Christmas day with. Please?  
Boss: You taking that day off would fuck us all over, so it's got to be a no  
Chef: If I can't have that day off then I quit  
Boss: I'm sure I can find someone else to fill in over the holidays...  
Chef: No rly  
Boss: ...

Well that's not a fucking debate at all! Its an utterly ridiculous position, and as usual any debate about immigration is painted as toxic or racist and swept under the rug.

A small steady stream of immigration is a good thing, that is a proven fact. Opening up the borders to the entire labor market of eurozone+ is NOT the same thing for fuck sake. 

Immigration should be subtle and result in integration, not the seismic demographic shifts we have already had in many parts of the country. Most of blue collar jobs where I live only hire poles, and entire neighborhoods seemingly became rental ghettos overnight. 

You can still talk bullshit even if you were a diplomat and have a knighthood. Nobody is saying pull out from the EU entirely or stop trading, we just want reasonable controls in place.

However...

A report by the Policy Exchange in 2010 estimated the total cost to society of smoking to be £13.74 billion, but they included all sorts of things like loss of productivity from people on smoking breaks, forest fires, and so on. I think it's fair to suggest that the report set out to justify increased tobacco taxation and thus tried to paint the worse possible case for smoking.

http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/category/item/smoking-costs-1374-billion-a-year-tobacco-duty-needs-to-rise-to-reflect-this-says-think-tank

http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/cough%20up%20-%20march%2010.pdf

Despite much googling, I can't find the more recent research (end of 2012 if memory serves) which extrapolated these figures, factored in inflation and so on, and arrived at the more reasonable figure of £9 billion being the ""worst possible case"" of the direct cost of smokers to the NHS. At the same time, taxation brought in £12.1, so there was still a net benefit of around £3 billion.

I think it's reasonable to conclude that smokers more than pay for their treatment on the NHS.  You have to argue pretty hard (as the Policy Exchange did) to stack the figures against smokers.  I personally think it's unreasonable to include the cost of cleaning up cigarette butts (the same argument could be made against the ""cost of chewing gum to society"") and disingenuous to include the loss in economic output of smokers once they've died (£4.1 billion).  Smokers not only pay for their NHS treatment, but they're also considerate enough to die younger before they start costing the NHS more money in their old age!

**TL;DR**: Cost to NHS is somewhere **between £5 and £9 billion**.  Tax revenue is **£12.1 billion**.  Conclusion: smokers contribute somewhere **between £3 and £7 billion** after paying for their NHS treatment.",0,1387200060,null,0,false,0,ce2zo9g,t3_1szgx0,t1_ce2zo9g,t1_ce2z7dv,null,1428110649,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

I mean, i told her i can't help it if i'm too sick to work but all she did was repeat the ""if you take an occasional absence before the end of March, your assignment may be ended"". I honestly just stared at her after she said that same sentence 2 or 3 times in response to my ""i'm only human"" and ""i can't control when i get sick"". 2 weeks ago, when the bug was going around, i even came in but ended up puking in the bathroom after lunch (the naff dinners didn't help) and so i took a half day.

It's a joke.

Why should the censorship stop there? Virgin is a big supplier, why shouldn't it block any news site that criticises the running of its trains? 

There should be laws to force IPs to provide access to all information on an equal footing. The dangers of censorship are far greater than those of liberty.

Good post.

UK has done what is necessary avoiding increase in debt and deficit. Once they go over iirc 90% then deep deep trouble. So recovery is going to be long and slow for the UK. But along with population increase it will recover. (Alas, the rate of immigration is a sore point).

Concerning Parliamentary Sovereignty, the EU clearly compromises that. It does not fully. But a new treaty required for Fiscal Union in the EU and more Treaties and binding agreements would almost certainly complete that process.

But I take it as a principle that the governments are not actually practicing democracy with the electorate over this issue and have NEVER DONE SO since 1975. It's really as simple as that.

An eg that is perfectly easy to understand. The Scottish are having THEIR referendum next year. Why them and not the rest of the UK? Of course The Spanish PM? Rajoy does not like that one bit and so the EU intractable politics goes on. Thanks for a good post unlike the tedious tribal behaviour of other posts  that are ""put downs"". It's funny isn't it: The EU is about uniting and it's actually seems to have created more divisiveness?

He has been with the club, he knows the players, he knows the other coaches he knows the trainers and the secretaries.  He has worked with the kids (and by most accounts) fairly successfully. He has Levy's ear.  Just a number of things that seem to line up that would find him in the slot of caretaker.

You might be right on the copying America's lead thing, but it remains to be seen if the US's new attitude to drug policy is a blip or a fait accompli - give it a few years and see what happens when the Republicans get back in.

true,BadBoyFTW,eng-derbyshire,Derbyshire,"&gt;I agree about the failure of abstinence policy, but I don't think that's enough for it to be made legal, even if it obviously should be.

I think it is at least cause to completely rethink the entire policy. I mean it's clear that the concept of ""stop them from getting it"" just doesn't work. End of story. The harm of those substances isn't even relevent, people will take them regardless of the effect or difficulty or punishment. I think that alone is argument enough.

Obviously once you throw in the facts and science behind the argument which show that, particularly for Cannabis, it is safer than tobacco and alcohol the argument is done and dusted. But I still think the former is enough alone to warrant at least a complete shift in thinking.

&gt;You might be right on the copying America's lead thing, but it remains to be seen if the US's new attitude to drug policy is a blip or a fait accompli - give it a few years and see what happens when the Republicans get back in.

A fair point... but I think the trends are going in one direction. And that's towards legalisation. [I mean, look at this.](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/10/19/us/politics/fivethirtyeight-1019-firstpot/fivethirtyeight-1019-firstpot-blog480.png)

Not to mention that in the last big push to legalise in California back in 2011 the poll results were absolutely facinating. Around 80% of those under 50 voted in favour and 90% of those over 50 voted against. That gives the pretty clear image it's a case of ""wait for the old people to die"". 

Ultimately nobody has to even change their opinion for it to become legal, simply the older voters (who were most heavily influenced by the bullshit, which now is not possible) to die and be replaced by new younger voters.

Also a lot of these international legalisation efforts are beginning to yield results giving even more ammunition and dispelling the bullshit propaganda. The legalisation movement is far stronger than ever, and has more ammo and money than ever. It's only a matter of time. And as I said, America is the lynchpin... once they legalize, everywhere else will follow.

Besides anything, it has emerged that he was hired in October and was informed that he has to work every Sunday as it's the kitchen's busiest day. He was sacked for saying he wanted every Sunday off leaving the pub a little bit stuck given his ""head chef"" status.

By law, he will still get a month's pay (unless it was gross misconduct) so he and his little'un will be fine financially for Christmas, so I'm not sure what he's complaining about there.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"you know, i think Sherwood's involvement with the team behind the scenes makes him preferable to Levy/Baldini/etc if we were to look internal.  I have been reading for a couple years how Levy really seems to think Sherwood has future club executive written all over him.  A caretaker role for 1/2 a season would be good experience for someone who down the line Levy thinks may have to make decisions on management moves.

Personally as nice as it would to have a homegrown manager i would rather we go for proven results.  We have had ups and downs this season and if we could get someone who can light a fire under the ass of the team and knows the ins and outs and specifically the potential pitfalls for a high level manager and how to avoid them could keep us in a good situation in terms of the table.

The complete unknowns like Sherwood/Fruend could obviously have a high upside but the down side is huge.  If the team flounders and slides down the season you risk players like Hugo/Jan/Sandro/Walker deciding that maybe the grass is greener elsewhere.  

Someone like Hiddink would be perfect for short term. Well known, well respected, tons of experience, players seem to like playing for him and he already has signed a contract to move on to coach for the Netherlands.  Means you could get a coach who could step in and drive a team for 1/2 a season that would likely be resepected by the players, would stand a good chance of keeping us closer to the upper side of the table and you wouldn't be linked to a long term commitment while you search out a long term replacement.

He drained us of confidence and from the way he conducted his interviews it feels like the team took on his personality.

AVB has been handed two squads with talent, and underachieved at both.  It's time to start re-appraising that miracle Porto year as a bit of red herring.  He may yet turn into a better manager, but he's not there yet.

So, I've no problem with the sacking--clearly, you cannot go about dropping 5 and 6 goals while finding it impossible to score more than 2 in any given match, but I don't get the feeling that any miracle manager is out there to reverse this team.

But if it shocks the lads a bit, and in doing so, allows much needed fluidity and creativity to start forming, then it will be worth it.

The success of taxing it is very debatable. Since people will still be growing and selling it the government is possibly going to suffer more as a result. Growers won't disappear, instead the numbers will likely increase and the government will get no tax from any of them.

true,nefron55,flair1,,"Everyone saying 'Fuck 4-4-2' needs to slow down a second. While a rigid 4-4-2 certainly doesn't fit our needs, there are elements of a 4-4-2 that we need to adopt. We need a player to get close to Soldado. Whether thats a second striker, or an attacking midfielder, he's not getting service because he is physically isolated. Nobody to combine with him. While it may not come in the form of a '2', it may be a '1-1' is required to get the best out of Soldado. Someone in the ilk of Van der Vaart. 

Secondly, traditional wingers. Once Lamela comes on, I would be very happy to return to having inverted wingers. But until that time, I think we will generally be best (read: not for all scenarios) with Lennon on the right and Townsend on the left. I think we need to stick with a 4-5-1 (grouped by field position, not by role) and have one of the 5 stick like glue to Soldado. One of the 5 shields the back 4. and the other drifts between. Far too often we've been caught with 3 or so players in the same position. I think this is partially because a high line compresses the pitch and makes it difficult for central players to find their own space. If we spread the pitch a bit, we can easily get 3 very differentiated central midfielders which I think will help us.

'Fuck 4-4-2' as if its not a VERY popular formation among 99% of world teams (aside from the elite 1%), belies realism and logic and isn't conducive to actual discussion.

I suspect if Paulinho hadn't gotten that red and they'd lost 2-1 or something instead, this would not have happened.

If anyone at all has a serious theological objection to a university which doesn't discriminate, segregate or exclude people on the basis of gender, colour, creed, sexuality, or whatever, then they can surely go elsewhere. The fairest way to handle the problem of people being discriminated against or excluded is to let those who demand such exclusionary practices exclude themselves.

Sure it can. It can have schools of Islamic studies, it can have an Islamic society and it can study and talk about Islam in 1001 different ways, and has done for decades, if not longer, without actually enforcing one or other flavour of religious law.

Villas-Boas enjoyed great success with a high line at Porto - although even there, the high defensive line seemed very risky at times. It’s the defining feature of his coaching style, and while it’s not a flawed tactic in itself, Villas-Boas repeatedly used it in situations where it didn’t suit his own players, and played into the hands of the opposition. That, put simply, is the opposite of the point of tactics…

The damning aspect isn’t the scoreline itself, or even the fact this was so similar to the City defeat. It’s that Villas-Boas he appeared to have learned his lesson from the City game, and changed his strategy accordingly…and then reverted to the high line against the Premier League’s most prolific striker, who loves running in behind defences. Sometimes bad results are unfortunate – you can lose 5-0 if a couple of players have an off-day, or if opponents are particularly clinical with their shooting. But when Villas-Boas’ sides get thrashed, the strategy always plays a huge part, and it’s generally the same issue.",0,1387208025,null,0,false,0,ce31tfw,t3_1t0db1,t1_ce31tfw,t3_1t0db1,null,1428109573,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

You can dissect a million statistics in American football or basketball and develop a strategy, but there were no statistics that would have told him how poorly the continental 4-2-3-1 would work in the prem.

That comes from keen observation, reflection, and proactive planning. We have the players right now. Townsend managed to score an absolute thunderbolt in his first England game because he was released down the center during counter attacking play. Between Paul, Sandro, Dembele, Lennon, Townsend, Holtby, Eriksen and Lamela we have a bunch of incredibly quick midfielders who can do a ton with the ball with limited possession. Sounds like a team that is tailor made for counter attacking play, not possession play.

Try your plan A, but at game 5, you take a look at your results and the limited number of good chances, and you adapt.

&gt;Spurs this season, first 16 games: 26/48 points, 54.17%

&gt;On a more serious note, Spurs seem to have the same problem LFC had a while back. We lost Torres, so we went out and spent big on ~~[a horse](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Horse-Exercise-Ball-Fail.gif)~~ Carroll, but we ended up with a team of 11 individuals. We hired BR, let him get rid of the dead weight and players that didn't fit the style he was trying to implement: Carroll, Downing, Cole, all let go. and now we have SAS and a bunch of promosing youngsters in our ranks. We let BR try strategies (three in the back?) and see what works, and what doesn't, and sure we have missteps (Hull, anyone?) but look at how we reacted when Flanno scored. Try to tell me that that isn't a team that loves each other.

Everything you assume about this guy would apply to them, too. 

If an employee says ""we should have a twitter account"" and then helpfully opens one for his employer, then I don't think any ""transfer of ownership"" is likely to be necessary - it can probably be assumed to belong to the employer from the get go.

If the employee were to helpfully open a twitter account in his employer's name, tweeting once a day for years before slandering or libelling someone on twitter, then the employer would get drawn into the lawsuit, irrespective of any ""transfer of ownership"". The judge would ask ""did you know the employee had created a twitter account for the pub?"" and if the answer was yes then the pub would be considered to have *de facto* appointed the employee as manager of its twitter.

IANAL either, but this case is unlikely to be considered worth prosecuting. The pub's solicitor should write to him saying ""cease using the account immediately and please surrender the password within 7 days"".

Nevertheless, if he had done something to attract police attention, the judge would look at his intent when creating the account - he previously retweeted reviews of the pub, so it clearly originated as the pub's promotional account, and not for some kind of parody or whistleblower purposes.

Sturridge: Yes, absolutely an automatic starter. Suarez is Suarez with or without him, but remember the runs Sturridge was making (and vice versa) to set up Suarez's goals? I think it's definitely worth pulling someone out of midfield, unless (again) the squad maintains the level of play from the first half of the Spurs match and we dominate everyone between now and January. But I doubt they will; honestly, we were getting kind of dominated in the second half (look at the possession stats) until that paulinho red.

Agger: No idea, but he's not going to want to sit on the bench.

Flanno: see who looks better in training once enrique's back. some real competition there is a good thing. But Flanno is still young; young players seem to be more likely to slump out of form sooner or later so my guess is we'll see enrique again soon.

**In general**, let's not get too excited about the Spurs result and throw away all our starters. Yes, we played very well. But let's remember that:

* Spurs back line was decimated by injuries *and* being forced to play a high line that those players really aren't capable of pulling off.

* Spurs were dominating possession in the second half something like **65%-35%** before Paulinho's red card. Of course it was already 2-0 at that point, but there was still half an hour left. Things could easily have gone quite differently if Paulinho hadn't decided to try to puncture Suarez's lungs.

* Everything that happened after that happened against a Spurs team that was down 2-0 and only had ten men, was clearly demoralized, and based on AVB's facial expression and the squad's reaction after the game (i.e. silence) probably knew that it was curtains for their manager.

* It's *one match*. Yeah, it looked fucking *great*, and it has been a while since I enjoyed watching a match that much. But it was still just one match.

I had a particular friend who I would always meet at a certain Nero because it was a halfway point between us, she sent me a Nero mug. Anything sentimental like that is bound to be appreciated and she just went in and explained why she wanted a mug and they gave it to her without charge.

Any time I get a gift that comes with a postcard from London/anywhere in England, I'm left smiling all day and they go on the fridge.

Are you asserting that there are no drug users who are productive members of society? Because that's balderdash. Richard Branson springs readily to mind, for instance.

Even if the average pot-smoker never rose above unskilled minimum-wage labour, that's still more productive than rotting in prison (as the cost of which, borne by the state, is an active loss of net productivity)... hell, even if they spent their whole life on the dole, that's still vastly cheaper for the taxpayer than court, prison, etc.

These are extremes, I feel there's 3 things to note. 


1. The defeat at Hull was (probably) more to do with Rogers than the victory at WHL. Owing much of the success to the players. (baring in mind point 3)


2. Given the contrast of very experienced and very inexperienced players - yet no cup or eu games to test our depth - extreme goods/bads is likely as we're forced to use depth in important games. 

3. Managers effect on teams are so coupled that it's hard to objectify or specify their actions into results. So basically we don't know. 


So to conclude, Rogers is being forced to test a new and contrast squad in a very important phase with little margin for error.

There's a MAJOR difference between been optimistic and saying ""Barca's defence is absolutely rubbish"" or ""I want United to stay in so we can knock them out"" which completely dismisses any chance of either Barcelona or United beating us.

Optimistic is ""we could win if X, Y, Z"" not ""WE'RE GONNA WIN EVERYTHING#! WE'RE THE BEST TEAM EVER!! #CTID #BANTZ #YOLO"".

&gt;You are an analyst, who also treats the rest of the subreddit like they don't know shit.

30 minutes ago you told me that because our defence has been dodgy we should not defend narrow and deep because it's risking a dodgy defence.  But it's tightening it up, this isn't high level football theory or anything here.

You're a med student here's a good example of the level of understanding of what you've just said.  You said that because we have an infection in one arm, instead of treating that arm with caution we should just cut it off and sow it onto the other shoulder.  As somebody who is training in the medical field, would you get frustrated if somebody said this with certainty then later complained that you putting out how ridiculous this is was ""treating people like they don't know shit""?

Everything is always extremes on this place.  You can't just be somebody who is rational, you have to be either a complete insane fan or somebody who obviously ""lacks passion"".  

It's retarded.  We're facing the best team in the world with a core that was the core of the best football team that HAS EVER EXISTED.  You people are treating it like we're going up against Scunthorpe because ""Yay optimism"".

The problem I have is that this specific matter is not something that can be taken more than one way. It's one thing to have varying opinions on things that are not explicitly stated in the show, and to fill in the blanks and resolve plot holes in your own way. It's another thing to completely disregard information that has both been explicitly stated in the show, and has since been reiterated by the show's head writer and producer, who also happens to be the original creator of the character in question.

A large amount of MPs get into politics with a genuine aim to make a difference and really do want to help. If your MP sucks, well I'm sorry for you but you have the power to change it. Campaign against them. Tell others not to vote for them. Write letters to the local newspapers saying how awful they are. Write them a letter saying why you are doing all this. Maybe they will start to listen if their poll percentages drop. At the end of the day, you have control over their job and once you and other people realize you can threaten ""safe seats"", then you can start demanding change. This is the civilised way to protest and contribute to policy. And what do you do if all your candidates are bad? You spoil your vote. That's why it's there. The other parties will still experience poll percentage drop and you send a message.

true,Tbickle,flair1,,"I agree.  I don't know if the problem was a 4-2-3-1 or if it was the style of play that AVB wanted us to put out on the field. We've had great passing and possession stats for most of the season, and that's a reflection of how it was directed for us to play. I never got the impression though that our players ever felt that they had that directive to attack, attack, and attack again.  Look at how Liverpool played yesterday, just throwing men forward. Yes, they scored on a few blocked shots or from odd angles, but that's because they had the directive to constantly push up and attack at all times. I have rarely ever felt that our players did that.

This is not really a bashing of AVB, he had a system he wanted to implement and it works for some teams. Maybe it was our combination of players, maybe we just needed more time, but whatever it was, it didn't work for us. Instead of trying to make our players fit into a mold they are not designed to fit into, I think that we just need to keep the current formation, but just open up the play to better fit what our players do best. We have a fast, passing team that could be very good on the break. If we need to go back to anything, I think it is the system that constantly has the defense on their heels and rushing back. We may miss a lot of shots and take a few risks doing it, but if we keep throwing men forward, feeding the ball into the box, the goals will start coming.",0,1387213697,null,0,false,0,ce33y7j,t3_1t0bvo,t1_ce33y7j,t1_ce31296,null,1428108580,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Agger needs to work his ass off in training and force his way back in. I still think Agger and Sakho may be our best pairing though we are still yet to see it.

Flanno deserves to keep his place until Enrique is back to full fitness then be the first FB off the bench for either RB/LB. Given Johnson's patchy form i'd say he has a shot at dislodging him if he keeps on playing well.

true,devineman,logo,,"Yeah we've been doing quite well.  Plzen was the whipping boy and Bayern's lads looked under developed but we got good results away in Germany and Moscow.

Marcos Lopes and Devante Cole are the joint leading scorers in the whole competition which is impressive given the quality that is on offer.  

Special mention as well to young Glendon who has been really impressive and is one of those players who has took on the challenge of improving.  He's a local lad and his Dad used to play for us way back when but when he was around 16 or so I thought he'd just be another one of those ""released to Hartlepool"" type players.  This past  year or two he has really improved his all round game to where he might have a shot at making the first team squad.  He is 18 now though which means that he needs to start getting some more regular top level football soon but he's showing promise.

Despite a rocky start, I think Vieira's done a good job there.  The team looks much more fluid and ""awake"" than under Lombardo and has a good team spirit now.  They don't exactly play their football like the first team do which is a shame but you can tell they are influenced by it at least.

We have a good chance of going quite far in that competition as we seem to be one of the stand out teams from the group stages.

The 4-2-3-1 working poorly was absolutely the problem, as the 4-2-3-1 is generally coupled with the high line. Having the two players in the anchor position allows for the midfield press and defensive cover that allows the territorial advantage necessary for the high line to maintain its position on the field. 

Formations are not just positions on a field. They indicate the territorial and tactical responsibilities of the positions. I was a huge proponent of the 4-2-3-1 at the beginning of the year, but the moment Rose went injured and Vertonghen (or even worse, a right footed full back) had to go wide, I knew we needed to change to a less rigid defensive philosophy. Without your speedy full back, you lose all of the attacking impetus from half of the pitch. This, by the way, proves the utter madness in loaning out BAE, regardless of the rumored character issues. The full backs are potentially the single most important positions in a 4-2-3-1, and if you look at all of the teams who have used it successfully over the years (Madrid, Dortmund, Manchester City, Bayern), they all have pacy wide full backs who able to cross the ball.

Had AVB adjusted his tactics to a 4-4-1-1 and reigned the fullbacks in a little bit and played outside footed wingers, we might have seen more joy for Soldado (more balls in the box) and less nightmarish defending out of position by our center backs. But, here we are, losing winnable games (Liverpool is very beatable.

The allied forces have been comparably successful in both of those aims for the majority of the country.

Granted, the problem comes when we pretend that we are doing stuff for women and children, as that only lasts as long as we bribe people to ensure it. Plus, it is an exceptionally bad democracy with lots of corruption, bribery and good old fashioned ballot rigging.

We have the second highest goal differential in the league after Man City and they just lost their top scorer for the next month.  We just finished ROUTING a team that was 3 points behind us in the league without our second leading scorer and our captain (who oh by the way leads the team in assists).  We have the best player in the EPL in the best form he has ever been in.  The team is playing for each other as a unit and you can tell by the way they celebrate together that they are all on the same page and willing to fight for each other to win.  Staying focused and not getting ahead of themselves is for the players, as fans we SHOULD be excited about the possibilities of this team and we are still title contenders.  You guys kill me with all the debbie downer BS.  I don't give a damn if a team has better players on paper, that's not what will determine the winner at the end of the year.  And right now we are playing as well as anyone in the league.

And what is the talk about being ""happy with a win at Cardiff""...of course we will be happy with a win.  City away I expect AT BEST a draw, though given their home form they should beat us.  Chelsea away I'd expect a draw, would be thrilled with a win, and would accept a loss.  That said, I don't believe those results affect our final title chances because they are away games against the top 2 teams (outside of us and Arsenal).  You shouldn't really ever expect to win away games against top tier opponents.  Those games aren't what determine if you are a title contender.

You're right that Spurs have a rich tradition of attacking, attractive football. They also have a long tradition of **fucking up and never being consistently good**. Even back in the 60s our double-winning side struggled with consistency and a large part of that is down to this naive philosophy that we need to win pretty.

It's a wonderful idea, but I can't help feeling that AVB was trying to build us into a side that had the grit to win titles. To remove this sado-massochistic infatuation with glorious failure that our club has. And for a short time I genuinely believed he might do it, but not anymore.

It wasn't perfect but it deserved to be played out to it's conclusion before we all decided that it was better in the good old days when we would score 3 and still manage to lose.

true,Evsie,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"&gt;And now it is stated that they expect you to print off emails, letters and screenshots of all your job applications (not everyone can afford a printer, especially not on JSA)

They won't worry about that after you do it once. 

I apply for 100-200 jobs per week, I take the shotgun approach, apply for *everything* remotely suitable, follow up on the ones I really want (normally an email to a recruitment consultant), get a couple of interviews (it is at this point in the process I collapse, I get so nervous pre-interview I end up looking like a moron... working on it).

Every application generates at least one email, normally an auto-response including ""here are some similar jobs you may be interested in"". Those emails from Reed run to 3 pages. Then there's the follow-up emails, the responses to those. In a ""good"" week I generate about 500 emails from job-seeking, running 1-3 pages each. Most weeks it's a couple of hundred.

The week they told me I needed to print everything off I asked if they would accept it on a flash drive, much discussion with managers and a conversation with IT support later, they said no. I told them my printer had no ink and I couldn't spare £45 to refill it, so can I bring them on a flash drive and print them there? Another round of conversations... yes, I could do that. 

Do you want a selection of them or *all* of them? They say all. Are you sure? Yes, we need to see everything. 

Why the hell they can't plug in my flash drive to their systems in case there's a virus on it, but can plug a flash drive into their networked PCs is a mystery, but it's their world, I just visit it. 


So, next signing day I have kept every email, of every application, every response... I arrive an hour early. 

""Hi, I need to use a computer to print off my emails... I'm going to need a LOT of paper."" 

Nice sensible guy behind the desk looks at me, he's one of the JC staff who genuinely seems to care, we've spoken at length a few times before, really nice guy who gets it. Understands that most people aren't happy being there, knows the difference between someone who tries and the few who are happy to live this way... 

""What do you mean by 'a lot'?""

""well, there are 526 emails, most running to three pages, and she said she'd like to see my tracking spreadsheet, that's another 30 odd pages for this month, and..."" 

""sorry, how many emails?"" 

""526""

""at three pages each?""

""not all, but most. So I'm guessing 1500 pages and three sets of cartridges for your inkjet should do it."" 

He knows. He knows I'm making a point, and he's with me... right up to the point where he realises he has responsibility for these supplies, and I'm about to blow £50 in ink and paper to print out a load of stuff nobody is ever going to read. 

""Erm, give me a minute."" 

He heads to the signing area, and talks to my advisor. Oh how I'd have loved to hear that conversation - judging by their body language there was a professional difference of opinion about what constitutes a waste of time and resources and what doesn't. A few minutes later he comes back to his desk.

""Yeah, you don't need to do that this week."" 

I hang around for a while, now ridiculously early for my appointment. Then she keeps me hanging around a while longer, I assume to reassert her power over me. When I sit at the desk she says ""do you have your job search record?"" knowing full well it's on a flash drive in my pocket. 

I take it out and place it on the desk. ""On here there is over 500 emails, and a page of the tracking spreadsheet I use. I arrived early to print it, your colleague told me not to."" 

""Well, I'll just have to take your word for it this time."" 

We do the signing thing, she gives me some jobs off UJM the good ones I've already applied for, and some that aren't remotely relevant), says goodbye. 

""So, erm, for next time... what evidence do you want from me, and in what form would you like it? Last time you said every email, that's apparently impractical, and I do wish to comply with your requests."" 

She hands me the same piece of paper they've been using forever. 

TLDR; there are good advisers and bad ones, try and transfer to a good one if you can, some JCs will allow it, others won't really depends on the manager. ",0,1387218940,null,0,false,0,ce367j6,t3_1t0b1g,t1_ce367j6,t3_1t0b1g,null,1428107525,38,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,38

Edit: Just seen [Berty_Strange's comment](http://www.reddit.com/user/Berty_Strange) and it does look the positions are more like work experience placements lasting a couple of weeks rather than internships as made out.

The reason our attack was so dull was because of too many changes too fast, both in personnel and tactics, added to the pressure the team was in because of not performing, and not because of negative tactics.

In fact, one of the reasons we conceded so much in the Liverpool game was because AVB tried to chase the game by getting in super-offensive mode (when he put Chadli, Townsend and Lennon on with a Holtby Paulinho midfield). This backfired horribly, since Paulinho was sent off and any chance of this working disappeared. This turned an already bad defeat into a thrashing, and might have cost AVB his job.

I think it was a mistake to sack him myself, especially at this point in the season. Let's hope Levy has a good replacement lined up, and that he'll hit the ground running, or we're going to be in a rough situation.
