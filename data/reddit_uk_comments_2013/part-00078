You could grab lunch at the One Square bar &amp; Restaurant at the Sheraton Hotel on Lothian Road. The dinner prices are quite steep but the lunch food served at the bar isn't too bad. Pretty sure booking is required for the restaurant but not sure about the bar. If you're just going for a quick bite it's a nice change ad excellent service plus they specifically advertise that they have a classic british menu. 

If that's a bit too high end for you then there's subway I guess. If you want something more in the middle I would reckon pub lunch is the way to go to be honest. There are plenty of nice wee restaurants but for the most part they are foreign food, quite a lot of italian places. 

Sorry if this isnt very helpful but you'll need to be a bit more specific about what sort of dining experience you are after.

true,daveime,null,null,"It's because they're marketing it more to the US than they are to the local audience now. This whole mid-season hiatus thing is nonsense, and leaves you unfulfilled and wondering, ""is that it for another 6 months"" ?

I also blame the 45 minute format, which sometimes allows for spectacular stories like Blink, but also allows for complete lemons like most of season 6 and 7. There's simply not enough time to tell any story deep enough before they're wrapping it up with a rushed ending and an unsatisfied feeling - one more ""love will save the day"" ending and I'll barf.

Sorry, I grew up on classic, which had season runs of 21 to 24 weeks and essentially only 5 or 6 stories per season. But those stories had time to develop and you understood the situation and characters. It never felt rushed (although sometimes it went the other way, many 6 parters could have been 4 parters).

Meh, I don't know ... it does seem to have gone off the boil, and Matt seems almost morose in his acting these days, like he'd rather be somewhere else (which he's made clear already). Maybe it's the scripts he has to work with, or the direction ... it's pretty much a completely different team than the ones who brought us the first few season.

There's just no oomph anymore. Hide was probably the best one of season 7 to date, and even that they had to add in that last 3 minutes that wasn't necessary.

The draw didn't feel good. And when he scored I didn't celebrate. After the bite was confirmed during the game I was extremely disappointed and the match was hard to watch with him on the pitch. And once he tied it (of course it would end that way and past the extra time of 6 minutes to make things more controversial) I could only laugh at everything on Twitter making fun of him. Hell any game with him in a red shirt from here on in the taunts at him will be even worse and louder sung.

I supported (and still do) with him against Evra. Sure he's dove in the past but 99% of footballers do it. But this I can't support. He's done it in the past and knows his behavior needs to be better. Players and coaches have had talks with him. But none of it gets through. He's a grown man, not a child, and needs to start acting like it. This is something deeply psychological that I don't even understand. And if you've read this up to here you'll know I can't even put it to words since my thoughts are all over the place on it.

So he's been my favorite player to watch since we got him. We need him. Everyone on the club supports him and I hope he can be redeemed.

--------

&gt;Originally from the US

Where abouts, may I ask, I am always interested.

&gt;Technically, I am British (dual citizen, Scottish mum), but I sure don't feel like I am.

You are legally British but not ethnically British. There is quite a difference between those two things. The reason you don't identify as British is simply because you are not. This isn't a negative and you shouldn't feel the need to identify as British, it is not a requirement to live happily in the UK. Ultimately, being American is a lot of what you are and no one, including yourself, should feel that you must be anything else.

&gt;My whole life is here now, and I plan on remaining in the UK permanently

It's nice to know. Give it a few more years and I am sure you will be running back ;)

&gt;I open my mouth... [and] the first question anyone asks is where I'm from

I wouldn't look too far into this really. They are just curious and I, and many others, are always delighted to meet people from other countries which maybe makes us a bit hasty when enquiring about your origin. Think about when you form relationships, you are eventually going to learn where people are from (all my friends know where I am from and I assume the same for you). Your accent just brings that about quicker.

&gt;I open my mouth I'm immediately seen as different

Do people actually treat you differently? I somewhat doubt it. Even if they do, it surely would only be a temporary affair? 

Prehaps your are percieving things differently to what they actually are.

Report back to me on this okay.

&gt;But I can't shake the feeling that I'm an outsider, and always will be.

I honestly think this will come down to you as a person. Hopefully some people who actually fit the critirea of your original question can be more help.

&gt;Is it always going to be like this? Will I ever feel like this is really my home, that I am not an outsider living in someone else's country?

I think this is ultimately down to you as a person and will ultimately decide whether you stay in the UK or not. 

&gt;This may/hopefully be due to the fact that I am still in uni

No they didn't. They spent two episodes leading us to believe she is normal. It's easy to stand there and state it as fact that she's normal once it's been spoilered by the release of info from the finale, but this is Moffat writing for Who. Misdirections and subterfuge are how he works.

&gt; Amy was assumed to be Amy by everyone in the audience.

Yes, but it was hinted that something wasn't right, just not what. They've hinted here that something isn't right with Clara, just not what.

We were also categorically told that the Doctor absolutely *did* die on the beach at the beginning of last season, and it was a fixed point in time and couldn't be rewritten, yet guess what?

&gt;They've now gone to great lakes to tell us that she's totally normal.

Exactly. Subterfuge and misdirection, remember? It is Moffat. You accept that we were deliberately mislead to believe she *was* unusual at the beginning, but refuse to accept that we could be deliberately mislead into thinking she's normal now, at the half-way mark?

&gt;It will be events that make Clara special and explain the conundrum of the times he's run into her and she's died.

true,pbfanatic,null,null,"I agree in that I don't want him to feel left to face the consequences of this alone.  I do want him to understand that this is unacceptable.  At the same time I think he's a bit misunderstood, and while embarrassing, his actions are harmless in terms of actually causing some sort of real injury.  I don't understand why he would do something like this.  I do know he's suffered on the other end of it, and it seems like there is a double standard in how these things are judged.  Take for instance Robert Huth's very clear stamp on his chest, which by comparison is much more dangerous in terms of causing real injury.  There's no outcry in the press for Huth to potentially be asked to leave his club or anything of the sort.  There's a kind of understanding in that situation that the sport is very physical, and that people do things they shouldn't do, and sometimes get away with it, and other times don't.  Again, I'm embarrassed by what he did, but I can understand based on how he's been treated in the past that he may believe that within a football match there is an unofficial physical conflict always going on where you have a certain duty to try and answer every kick the other team gets away with something equal in response as a means of self-defense. Again, what is acceptable in this regard is largely a matter of culture, and I think Suarez's isolation culturally hurts him here.  For instance in American baseball, we have certain traditions where if one member of a team gets hit by a pitch, the pitcher of that team will usually try and retaliate by hitting someone else on the other team.  This is unofficially accepted by all baseball players, but officially it often results in players getting ejected from the game and in extremes cases they may get banned for a few games, but nobody is embarrassed by this behavior, it's accepted as part of the culture of the game.  I think Suarez severely misunderstands the cultural context for these sorts of skirmishes in the European game, and I think if you read a bit about his background and where he comes from that is clear.  I also don't think he understands that what he can get away with in the European game is also very much determined by how good your PR is, and if you've ever seen his interviews you can tell he doesn't really take PR very seriously at all.  He seems very shy about talking to the media and wants to do all his talking on the pitch.  If he was a media darling like a C. Ronaldo or such or G.

true,Footie_Note,flair5,,"I think AVB wants to give Bale that 'next-level' chance to grow as a player, and I don't disagree that he should be able to wander. I am also with you on the point of being able to shut down a winger if an opponent is ready for it, and that has clearly happened previously. I guess I'm just also agreeing with Mrmunchkin when he talks about that kind of free-flow, roaming style of play, which is what I thought Spurs had, inherently. It's about dazzling the opponent with unpredictable movement and passing, because we know we can do that, and the opposition tends to underestimate us.

I guess all I really want to see is Lennon and Bale switch play several times before scoring at will; demonstrate the true glory of our wing power. Because you know the seasons prior were great 'cause 'Arry was playing classic, English 4-4-2 (or 1-1, if you're particular), and a lot of that worked 'cause of the quality of our wingers. It's that kind of pace that makes it happen, which is why I think Bale's amazing drives can produce more fruit when they are on the side, rather than down the center. The center is too easy to choke with players, and it negates a great run like that. Again, keeping in mind that Bale and Vertonghen have done such things this season.

Shit, I'm rambling...

But I remember Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes series being really popular back in the 80s.

There's something about cosy detective fiction that really doesn't hold up well nowadays, at least for me. Every story just has to have a parlor scene where everything is explained. Every story has to have that one forbidden romantic sub-plot. It's almost always the least expected suspect that turns out to be the criminal. In the parlor scene everyone shows up and the villain always goes quietly. Every episode starts with Poirot hobnobbing with ""high society"" and in general almost every episode is a ""lords and ladies problems"" type deal, I'd say at least 50% is about some kind of inheritance. They just have to show Poirots quirks in every episode, and sometimes it gets a bit tired and forced (we know he has OCD, no need to show it 50 times). Cosy detective fiction never has anything that's vicious, and the criminal always seem rather unintelligent with relatively boring motivations. There's rarely any violence.

I always preferred anything Sherlock Holmes and I always thought Arthur Conan Doyle's writing was much, MUCH better. The crimes were much more imaginative and the mysteries were rarely predictable page-turners. It's classic vs pulp almost.

Although I do appreciate David Suchet's depiction of poirot. I do see that the sets are amazing, the costumes, the attention to detail and the overall direction. Sometimes though the overall screenwriting is a complete mess.

My question is though: Why would Suarez do that?
Even after all the previous controversial incidents, you would think Suarez would know better; We can't possibly know.

The only logical explanation i can think of is that he has some kind of personality disorder. Some kind of extreme competitiveness. I think we know Suarez isn't a scumbag who does these things for fun. Outside of the pitch he is a family man. From the pictures, videos and interviews i've seen, he seems like a normal happy guy. We see it when he hangs around with Lucas and Coates, even in training he seems to always be smiling. But when he steps onto that pitch he becomes something else, he will do anything to win. I think that is why he has such an incredible workrate, always running and trying to get that goal, pushing around defenders and that is also what makes him such a sublime player aside from the vision and technical skills he possess. 

Today we saw how his competitiveness got the better of him. In my opinion that handball was an accident. He got pulled in the box and somehow his hand ended up above his head and the ball hit it. You could see his anguish and frustration over possibly having cost his team points. 
And so he did everything he could to get Liverpool back in the game. His first two touches after the penalty failed him, and he became even more frustrated, and then when he got shoved around by Ivanovic, he snapped and bit him. 

Maybe its abit overly dramatic, but its the only logical explanation i can think of. 

Suarez deserves a lengthy ban for what he did, and i think he will get it. I'm hoping the club will be the ones taking action first and then the FA will follow up. 

However, i dont want Suarez to leave the club. I love the way he plays,i think we all do. 

He obviously needs help, i hope he gets it, and comes back stronger next season!

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I've been exceptionally passionate many competitions throughout my life.  Obviously I've never played football at a level even remotely close to Suarez, but playing in state tournament games and stuff, I have played in front of more people than an average highschool match.  I've been insanely frustrated in some of those games too.  I did well enough for myself (earned scholarship offers from a number of school) too, but I wanted to WIN.  In my frustration I've wanted to fucking deck the asshat defender who kept talking trash, or kick the guy who just went in studs up.  Those desires are amplified exponentially when my team wasn't playing well, or we were losing a game I thought we deserved to win.  

However I have never even come close to wanting to BITE someone.  It seems inherently wrong to do that to another person, there's something more disturbing and unsettling about the idea of biting someone instead of punching them.

That said, Suarez better stay, and I hope he stays forever.  He's been so good this season, and he's really made huge strides in his behavior.  I hope that this can get put behind him and he can continue on being the magnificent son of a bitch that we've known and loved this season.  He plays with his heart on his sleeves and his drive is virtually unmatched.  I love him for it, and I support him as a player.  As our player.

true,[deleted],null,null,"#1 - jumpstarted the series. Bit too crotchety, but that was typically the McGuffin needed to leave the security of the TARDIS and go exploring in history.

#2 - hated his outfit. It's one thing to channel Chaplin, another to dress like him. That being said, he had a juxtaposition of youthful soul and aged wisdom every actor after him has given an upnod to.

#3 - one of THE best. Dashing looking, sarcastic when needed, good with the kung-fu and could pilot everything from a motorcycle to a flying car. Dressed the part, had a day job, 0 fucks given about everything else.

#4 - he grew on me. Didn't like him at first. The Goth-Horror seasons he had were some of THE best. Ended up in ""painful torture situation"" bit too many times. Toned down the zaniness, brought a sagacity combined with not taking himself too seriously that referenced #2 without being too too silly.

#5 - Why did they pick an asthmatic with a combover? Dug the outfit, thought he had the right kind of youthful charisma to get the gig - some great eps. 

#6 - Criminally underused. Dressed like he was drug through a remnant shop backwards. Mocked for his weight, he saw the character as a middle aged man starting to teeter towards crankiness and world weariness, they wrote him as a sarcastic angry bastard. They didn't bother to put voice effects on the Daleks and paired him with Mel. Then booted the actor unceremoniously right on the heels of his real life kid dying. When you see what he was trying to accomplish, you respect the man deeply, even though everyone around him was so intent on fucking him up.

#7 - I cringed in horror. Visions of him sqwalking like a parrot in a lifesize cage on ""Vision On"" dressed in a bird costume and all that. But he turned into a sort of celestial chessplayer who had no problems putting his own friends in danger to get a result. An intriguing man with a dark side.  EXCEPT WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT BULLSHIT ENDING TO DRAGONFIRE

#8 - fuck Fox

#9 - Ey up! Ah northerner! Loved the coat, thought it not Doctor-y enough. Didn't see him long enough to truly appreciate his skill and his banter - HATED the love interest with Rose bullshit, but he brought gravitas back. and the new season was awesome enough to give us

#10 - started strong, turned into a gurning self-parody by the end. Nice outfit, cute Scots accent. One of the best, though, even though he's the pancakes version of Doctor Who.

#11 - A very talented actor with an alien face. Starting to get a bit rote in the role, but then again, they're now writing for it, aren't they?

Further, is there any place in the game for leg breaking challenges, refusing to play to force a move, diving and pleading for red cards, or sleeping with teammates' wives? Fuck no.

This was indeed Suarez's second biting incident, but all of the cunt players I listed (and many, many more) have habitual issues too. At least Suarez has attempted to curb his behavior. Has Pepe? Do Robben, Bale or Busquets still dive? Yes. Luis is trying to fix his behavior and this is his first blip this half of the season.

Chelsea fall victim to Suarez's disgraceful villainy
Posted by Phil Lythell
RECOMMEND42TWEET6EMAIL

Andrew Yates/Getty Images
Why referee Kevin Friend and Liverpool's Luis Suarez are smiling in ths photo taken shortly after Suarez appeared to bite Branislav Ivanovic is anyone's guess.
As Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Liverpool on Sunday showed in horrific style, football can be the cruelest of sports. 

For the second time in a week, the Blues were denied their just desserts through another shocking display of refereeing. Last Sunday, it was Chris Foy who saw Sergio Aguero's two-footed stamp on David Luiz only to book the player before turning down one of the clearest penalties you are ever likely to see as Fernando Torres bore down on goal. 

-Suarez again villain &amp; hero in draw 
-Suarez could face discipline 
-Tyler: Takeaways from a manic game 

Sunday, Kevin Friend outdid his colleague by failing to send off two Liverpool players who then combined to score the last-gasp equaliser 40 seconds after the frankly ludicrous six minutes of stoppage time had been completed. 

In the league table of incompetent officials, Friend now sits ignominiously on top of the tree just ahead of the hapless Foy. 

Being well-versed in the scripts that football invariably produces, it was almost inevitable that it would be Luis Suarez who had the last laugh. The despicable Uruguayan would have had the headlines anyway through his disgusting actions midway through the second half, though he made certain of it by netting his 30th goal of the season. 





The football authorities in his native Uruguay have been staunch in their defence of their star striker, claiming that the powers that be in England are pursuing an agenda against him. Quite what excuse they will come up with in an attempt to exonerate Suarez after he sank his teeth into Branislav Ivanovic is anyone's guess. 

What on earth possesses anybody, let alone a professional footballer, to bite another human being? When a player is infuriated, he might usually lash out with a kick or an elbow; at a stretch, a punch or a head butt. 

Biting somebody is not a natural act of retaliation, though the rules of engagement that govern normal people clearly do not apply to Suarez. Don't forget, he already has form in this area having served a seven-game ban for the same reprehensible act while playing for Ajax. The FA must see to it that he doesn't play again this season and Liverpool must surely take internal action. But don't be surprised if his teammates rally around him by wearing 'Pray For Suarez' knickerbockers when they next do their pre-match warm-up. 

Whatever the repercussions for the player, it won't affect Chelsea and will not benefit them whatsoever. The damage had already been done, not just by allowing Suarez to stay on the pitch to head home in the 97th minute, but also by not punishing Daniel Sturridge for an over-the-top challenge on Ryan Bertrand. 

Even the former Chelsea man knew it was bad judging by the way he instantly tended to the left back. Sturridge is not a dirty player, but the challenge was reckless and should have earned him a red card. Had justice been correctly administered -- rather than Friend inexplicably opting to play on -- then he would not have been in the position to send that fateful cross toward Suarez. 

Liverpool should have been down to nine men yet finished with 11. It is difficult enough to play at a red-hot Anfield at the best of times, even harder when acts of assault are ignored by officials. 

In truth, Chelsea were poor in the second half but wrested a lead after conceding to Sturridge just after halftime. However, despite being on the back foot, it would only take someone fiercely partisan to claim that the Blues did not merit the three points. 

Petr Cech made a couple of smart stops though the Chelsea defence was rarely carved open even if the midfield saw little of the ball after the break. Fernando Torres was subdued which made the job all the more difficult without a reliable outlet and the magical trio of Eden Hazard, Juan Mata and Oscar were unable to play their cute triangles in the business area of the field. 

Nevertheless, Chelsea had been the better team in the first half and a few smarter decisions could have seen the 1-0 lead at halftime extended. A slow start was soon dispelled as John Obi Mikel and Ramires broke the play up neatly with the ball being won in advanced areas to allow Chelsea to attack with purpose. 

That balance shifted after the break with the introduction of Sturridge from the bench, though the Blues kept their shape admirably without offering too much of a threat on the Liverpool goal. Their stubbornness should have been rewarded with a win; instead Liverpool's answer to Count Dracula plunged his fangs into Chelsea's quest for Champions League football next season and shamed the sport in the process.

It was something like that anyway. My memory of it is a big bit fuzzy.

On the other hand, New Who explains regeneration as using ""regeneration energy,"" of which a Time Lord apparently only has so much. Apparently, that's how River used most of her regenerations to save the Doctor, something that wouldn't have been possible if it used hormone packets that broke upon use like in Classic Who. And even if that was handwaved, that still wouldn't explain River's ability to regenerate in the first place because of that thing about Rassilon that I mentioned and don't have a source for.

Long story short, regeneration is absolutely *the* most mucked up and retconned thing about New Who, so it doesn't really matter whether or not the Doctor *can* regenerate, because Moffat will think of something.

I mean you had derivatives that repackaged bad debt in such a complex way that it made it look like good debt (In my world that's called a botch job.) You had self interest deregulation of an industry by the very people the regulation was supposed to protect it from in the first place. You had money created on the back of nothing and then gambled to try and make more money from that ""non"" money.  You had entities charging interest on money that never existed in the first place effectively making money from virtual money. The list goes on and on. 

I believe that they - in the financial power houses - always knew that one day this system would collapse because of the unstable foundations it was built on in the first place - it was only a matter of time -  and in the last ten years the people in the know have just been completely on the take before it did collapse. They've bled the well dry and stockpiled the water for themselves. The wealth is still there, it's just been siphoned off. 

I mean when you really look at what's gone on it just makes your fucking head hurt. Those in power have literally got away with daylight robbery and left everyone else to pick up the pieces. Like we somehow caused any of this.

Assuming all the applicants have an equal weighting/value in the eyes of the employer(s), which of course they don't. Some simply fall into dark the valley of unemployment and struggle to get themselves out again, no matter how hard they try.

Some of the hardest hit (and most vulnerable, financially and emotionally) in the current economic climate are the 'working disabled' - those with physical/mental impairments but still able and willing to work.

For a few years now we have all lived beyond our means.

But who really wants to change and make the needed sacrifice? A tiny percentage is the truth. What is more likey to happen is we will be forced to change eventually and we are starting to see the seams come apart now.

But it needs to be a top to bottom change all round. Its a bit like trying to combat national wide corruption. Its not just the policiticians, police, big business. It is systemic and needs to be addressed by all.

I'm buying a new flat (have had to move for job opportunities) in August, and have worked out a budget. Taking out a mortgage of 2/3rds of what the bank was willing to lend me, my mortgage payment is a little under a third of my net income. So far, so good.

However; when you add council tax, gas, electricity, telephone line, broadband, TV licence, factoring charge (it's a flat), and money put aside for maintenance, it's now slightly over half my net income.

When you then add food, clothing, travel, put some money aside for replacing furniture/furnishings, and generally things that there's some limited lee-way on, but not a lot, we're over three quarters of my net income.

So what I'm saying is that I have to provide entertainment (except for the TV, which I covered earlier), holidays, luxuries (TV, computer, etc.) out of the remaining quarter of my income, and also save for unexpected problems. It's under a quarter, so even if I skipped that entire list, I would have one month's contingency fund for every three months I do absolutely nothing fun.

The kicker; I have a rock-solid 11 and a half years employment since I graduated with a CS degree, and have nearly completed a part-time PhD in software engineering. That makes me extremely fortunate in relative terms.

Specifically...

&gt; Bulgarians and Romanians gained the right to visa-free travel to the UK in 2007, when their countries joined the EU. But there were temporary restrictions on the kind of jobs they could take. Employers had to apply for work permits and migrants for an ""accession worker card"". Low-skilled workers were restricted to existing quota schemes in the agricultural and food processing sectors. **These restrictions will be dropped on 1 January. Bulgarians and Romanians will also be entitled to claim the same benefits and NHS care as other EU citizens.**

In the mean time your biggest worry will need to be proving your ability with the English language. I know it sounds daft but I work in recruitment and a big issue for both us and the companies we work for is that if our candidates really struggle with spoken / written English, they'll be at a huge disadvantage even if they are technically skilled for a job. 

Anything you can do to show that you're quite capable in that area would be a good start.

www.indeed.co.uk

Since you are studying economics, you might find www.w4mp.org more useful - it used to be the site for political jobs but because of the quality of applicants and it's (relative) obscurity many think tanks and research organisations post there.

&gt;It doesn't have to be in my field of study. I would take any job that would allow me to pay rent and food until I find a better paid job.

I'm not knowledgeable about Aberdeen, but if you want '*any* job (i.e waiter, store clerk, shelf stacker) then I would consider not mentioning you are a graduate. The reason is, you intend to leave when you find something better - why would they hire you to see you leave in a month? It's a common problem grads face. You'll have to weigh up the pro's/cons of that yourself.

The big supermarkets are usually always looking for extra people (Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, Sainsburys). I would also go door to door around local pubs looking for kitchen or bar work. Take a CV and a strong dose of confidence.

You can also walk up and down a high street or parade of shops and hand out CVs. Make sure you get a UK phone number.

If I were you I would get a http://giffgaff.com/ sim card and a cheapo phone. (You probably already have one I imagine, so just shove a sim in that).

Furthermore, make sure you tailor your CV and personal statement (it's called a cover letter here btw) to each job. Many people forget that. However, for casual work (bar, supermarket etc) you will probably be filling out application forms. Keep your CV and cover letter to jobs you apply for by email.

On that note, many continental CV's like to add photo's - that's a big no-no here.

Following an on street parking dispute with a neighbour, we were reported to the RSPCA for ""never letting the dog outside"".

They visited, which was fair enough. Luckily they arrived while I was acually out walking the dog, and spoke to me as I returned. The official said that the report was ""clearly a lie"" after inspecting the dog for muscle and fat.

A week leter another RSPCA jobsworth turned up. Same report. Same result. 

A week later it hapened again. By this point I was rather rude to the person and informed them that they should try reading records of previous visits. In a slightly less polite way. 

This resulted in my house being watched by someone from the RSPCA in a van for some considerable time. This of course causes some embarrassment with other neighbours (and taking up a precious on street parking space).

3 questions i have with them even putting this story out there....

1) Why would Spurs want him? We have Sandro who is a better holding mid than Song to begin with when healthy (granted we have yet to see how he fairs returning from injury) but we also have 3 other players (4 if you include Mousa) in Parker, Thudd and Jake that could provide short term cover for Sandro while he heals.

2)Why would song want to leave Barca because he isn't getting playing time to come to Spurs and (according to the ""article"") compete with Dembele and Sandro both of whom i would prefer on the pitch over Song.  Song is really good holding mid, but he isn't the play maker that Dembele can be and isn't the midfield destroyer that Sandro (when healthy) is meaning he would move from the Barca bench to the Spurs bench and knowing Spurs he would also need to take a paycut. I don't see that happening.

3) Most importantly....why would Spurs dish out £15m for a holding midfielder when we still need to get a front line striker??.....If you are really in the market for a holding mid you can find one for a hell of alot cheaper than £15m (Wanyama and Ignacio Camacho come to mind), meanwhile a frontline striker (which we have needed for 4 seasons) is going to cost at a minimum of £12m-£16m.  Why would we put our cash into a player (and granted Song is a good player) that we don't have a glaring need for when we still haven't filled the void we have been trying to fill for 4 seasons?

The odd thing is that, in order for those political philosophies to work, it requires a *better standard of behaviour* than our current society and a more complete understanding of how we affect each other. The freedom espoused in these philosophies is not a carte blanche to act or react however you like - it is, rather, a responsibility you willingly take upon yourself to police your own actions rather than allowing the state / society to exert external pressure to do the same. In theory, it allows the social contract to be a fluid, evolving thing based on co-operation and understanding.

Also, if they did pay full rates of tax, they probably wouldn't pay anything, because they'd just leave.

Which is strange, considering anarchist and marxist philosophy is specifically about dealing with the plurality of ideas and conflicting needs. It would be completely unnecessary if everyone had the exact same zeal for the same philosophy. Unfortunately, as we have seen, this creates a space for those to impose their own beliefs, rather than a process by which we come to an agreeable compromise. 


&gt; I'm having a similar dialogue with a friend of mine who is a devout communist. Staunchly supporting North Korea as it is allegedly Marxist.

Wow. Just.. wow.

North Korea is not Marxist. North Korea does not even believe in the Juche philosophy it espouses, as that is used as a rallying cry internally and as external propaganda to make it look like NK believes in self-sufficiency, which it does not.

It is a dependency state in which the leader (any of the Kims) is purposely made into an androgynous parental figure (hence the tunic and fat) and the populace is conditioned to believe that the Korean race is a race of pure, childlike beings who are unable to do wrong and, thus, need a parental figure to take care of them. Interestingly, this Korean race mythos was created by the Japanese when the Korean peninsula was under occupation - they were determined to make the Korean people a Japanese-style fighting force, and so re-worked Japanese myths for Koreans.

It is, therefore, safer to say that the base ideology of NK is Imperial Japanese, and is used to further the aims of three main factions: the cautious military, the supremacist military and The Party who vie for power constantly, using leverage over the Leader.

Historically, the NK approach to Marxism (actually Leninism) is completely ass-about-tit, given that when Russia founded the NK Communist Party, they filled it with uneducated farmers and soldiers and placed it under the auspices of ex-Japanese sympathisers who continued with their work creating The Korean Myth and simply added bits of communist rhetoric to it. For decades, no-one in the NK Communist Party understood or could understand Communist thought because no Communist materials were available in Korean. The USSR authorities were rather bemused by the NK approach, but were happy to let it continue as long as it both appeared to work and appeared to pay lip-service to the ideals of the USSR. In order to appear like NK had contributed to Communist thought, the Juche philosophy was retroactively created and lauded, despite being completely undefined in anything but the most nebulous sense. (As seen in B.R. Myers' 'The Cleanest Race').


&gt; They keep justifying the worst things Stalin did, and that the North Koreans do because it furthered the aims of socialism and resisted the imperialist aggression of the west.

That kind of black and white thinking is despicable. Socialism and even Marxism are laudable goals, but we cannot be blind to the fact that they simply may not work.

Personally, I believe that the world is destined for a form of marxism, simply because we are reaching a state where labour is increasingly automated and, within a few decades, we will have home-based 3D printers (and more) that will definitively place the means of production not just in the hands of 'the people' but in the hands of the individual. Consider the commodification of current digital goods (music, movies, etc) and the ease by which we can copy them - which is just a taste of things to come. In fact, the current outdated approaches to Marxism and Communism do not apply to that sort of technological upheaval, and could seriously threaten it and, therefore, a better life for all. Capitalism's constant drive for efficiency will eventually divorce that particular system from humanity proper (humans, after all, are the biggest inefficiency in capitalism), leading us inexorably towards a form of modified marxism lest we end up with countries with 90% unemployment and massive starvation.

true,soccermocker,num7,,"I don't think buying Song should be a priority for Spurs but here are a couple of thoughts.

Song is really a box-to-box midfielder who plays in the holding role for Barca. The Barca system needs a holding midfielder with technical ability, good vision, disciplined positioning and conservative passing and that is how Song plays. He is capable of doing more though. When he started at Barca, he tried to do too much and that led to his much publicized ""failures"" but in the last few months he seems to have understood the system and done great a job for the team.

Song has good vision, very good short passing and is good at the intricate one-twos that Barca play. Dembele's style is different because he is a clever dribbler and I'm not sure Sandro has the creative ability of Song, so he definitely offers something very different. If AVB wants Spurs to become a team capable of playing their way through the middle of a crowded defence, a player like Song is probably required.

Again, I'm not sure he should be a priority and I agree with you that he wouldn't leave Barca unless he is guaranteed a starting place, but these are just my thoughts on why he might be a target.",0,1366632644,null,0,false,0,c9k7eng,t3_1cupn4,t1_c9k7eng,t1_c9k6f65,null,1431470845,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

No, the truth is that governments want to sell us, the public, a bill of goods -- that they will use their new powers to catch terrorists and child abusers -- the truth is that they will catch only a negligible number more than they would have anyway, and they will be only the most stupid of perpetrators.

Similar, not the same. You'd do 5 highers, but you only do 3 A-levels. If you do advanced highers normally you'll only do 2, because they're the hardest pre-university exams (excluding the IB) available.

&gt;So I take it that there are no equivalency tests through the educational system in the UK like the GED, and one has to take the same exams that secondary school students take upon graudation.

Yes, although they do not have to be taken at school. We have colleges, you would call them community colleges over there, where one can study for highers or A-levels.

However once the highers or A-levels are finished, you do not go into 2nd or 3rd year university, you start at the beginnning. While one can do the first one or two years of a four year degree in a college by doing an HNC or HND and then transferring into a bsc or MA, it's generally considered undesirable because there's a huge step up in difficulty.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"To play...God's advocate?

Isn't their office already established elsewhere and that's why they pay no tax? Ireland or somewhere right?

The only way they could avoid paying the proper sum was by pulling out of the UK market which not only would be a huge publicity disaster for them (""Google pull out of biggest oversees market because it's asked to actually pay tax!"") but would also mean losing about $2.5 billion a year they would normally get. It would never happen. The jobs they have in the UK has little bearing on the money they make from UK business as most of it is ad revenue online which requires only a few employees not in the UK. 

Talking of employees, if we take Schmitt's argument that tax avoidance is fine because the savings are reinvested in jobs. Google uses the money it saves, about [450 million a year,](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/dec/20/google-avoids-450m-corporation-tax) to invest in jobs in the UK, the figure quoted is &gt;2000 so lets give them the benefit of the doubt and say they create double that - 4000 jobs. Also lets say that they only spend half that amount on those 4000 jobs and spend the rest on other helpful investment that didn't create jobs. If you want you can throw in another 1000 jobs created indirectly by this other investment. I'm giving them the best chance to be efficient at creating jobs in the UK. Even so compared to the government, which can attract loads of other private investment to projects it invests in, Google does pretty poorly. From a [few](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/boosting-private-sector-employment-in-england) [government](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/7-million-for-devon-s-growing-firms-to-help-create-400-jobs) [sources](http://news.bis.gov.uk/content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&amp;ReleaseID=421806&amp;SubjectId=2) I've vaguely averaged that the government provided the same amount of money can create or sustain about 44,130 jobs. One passage estimates 127,000 for 450 million but i've found lower figures for small scale projects that bring the average way down. 

Even if that's an overestimation on the part of the government which is perfectly possible, it would have to be by a factor of 10, a level of incompetence I would even put past government ministers, for it not to be true that the government was more efficient at creating jobs than Google. Thing is, IT doesn't have a supply line where as manufacturing and construction jobs do so 1 direct job in construction may create 5 jobs in making the parts for that construction. The government has the choice where to invest and the power to attract broader private investment. 

If Google really cared about the country then they should give the money to the tax man rather than investing it itself as it is clearly much worse at doing so. That's one argument you could make.

It is perfectly reasonable to point out that he is our best player.

 Also ""never put a healthy dog down"" in reality isn't a reason to go to a shelter as healthy is a vague term. Old dogs and unstable/untrained dogs can be classed as unhealthy. Obviously they try to do some work with the mental ones to give them a chance but I don't know of any shelter that will rehome an animal that snaps at humans. 

If anyone reading this is thinking of adopting then morally it's all a much of a muchness, adopt from a kill shelter and you potentially saved a life, no kill and you are helping them keep more dogs for longer. What you should do is just go to the one closest to your house because your new dog will have less time to throw up in your car and not settle if you don't find one that suits you, either go to a different shelter or wait.
 
You need not to be blinded by the sales pitch and blurb, that overly cheerful person wants you to take home an animal and will feed you a whole bag of horse shit to get you to do so and they will do it with a happy grin of their lying lying face.

 For example a fair whack of dogs will state no cats/no children/no other dogs/don't let off lead. I would not get one  with more than one of these notes myself because it indicates that they have not been trained properly, which is fine if you know how to train a dog but the fact is that people get adult dogs from shelters in the first place because they don't want to have to do the puppy thing. 
I know people think ""well I  have no children or other pets so I will be fine"" but I guarantee you that every time you take said dog for a walk they will see one and try and get out of the collar and escape, they see one in a neighbours garden and they will also try to escape. You can also kiss your furniture, carpet, lino and the inside of your car goodbye as if they don't respect you enough to not go for other animals or chase when you say no then they sure as shit won't respect the idea of not chewing your stuff. 

 It's not your fault if you end up having to return a dog like this, and you shouldn't suffer for months with a dog you end up hating - they should never have re homed it without additional training in the first place.

tl:dr that nice lady showing your round is as dodgy as a second hand car dealer, try and read though the bullshit and don't think that saying no will make you a bad person. 

edit: also get it's nuts lopped off asap, go right from the shelter to the vets if you have to.

It's commonly known as MXE around here and while it's been banned from sale it not actually illegal to possess. They got a bit high and where going for a walk when some ass called the police on them and the friend who had the bag on him was thrown in a police car and taken to sober up in a cell. When he had his wits about him again he pointed out to the police that they need to test what he was taken with as it was a legal high systentic and they can't hold or charge him for having it. Now the police, being the dicks they are, did this found out that he was right but then claimed they found traces of cocaine and used that as an excuse to give him caution anyway. Upshot is that if the guy gets found with illegal drugs again he faces some serious trouble.

Now I have some friends who work in a head shop that sells legal highs and I have other friends who take them. Imagine being able to get potent drugs (some type of which you prefer over the illegal counterparts, meow for example is another legal being turned illegal that is now often sought out for it's own sake rather than as a replacement) by simply strolling in to shop, saying hello to your friend and asking for it knowing that you are not going to ruin your life (in one way at lest) by getting a criminal record for having a bit of fun and maybe even scoring a staff discount if the manager is feeling nice. Can you see that maybe a little preferable to dealing with a criminal that, no matter how nice they may seem, are incredibly dangerous people for the most part?    

Either way you are sticking chemicals of dubious origin in your body, one in a 'perfectly' legal manner and the other not. There's all kinds of reasons that the illegals (if you are getting them unstepped on or cut) are less of a risk to your health but if you are already willing to risk taking drugs it's not a huge step to seeing legals as an attractive alternative given that they won't screw you over in legal sense. 

So in a roundabout way we come to this

* Have a pint at the Wellington. It's a cool pub. If you're lucky they might have some of the beer tastings going on. Definitely recommend hitting there up. 
* Hit up a class at the [MAC](http://www.macarts.co.uk/). It's pretty cheap and there's a lot you can do. Most classes are between £4-£10, so it's a lot of fun to just pop in and try new things out.
* It'll cost you maybe about a fiver to take the train out to Lichfield and a good 40 minutes, or so, but it's a nice little journey direct from New Street to a sleepy little town with a gorgeous Cathedral. If you like architecture I'd suggest you give it a go and check it out.

They would only lose $2.5bn if they left the UK entirely. Moving their headquarters makes no difference. I'm fairly sure their European headquarters are in Ireland so they can pay the lower taxes there. They take money from customers in the UK send it to Ireland from the UK and report a loss in the UK and a profit in Ireland. Therefore they have no profits in the UK to pay tax on and only pay tax in Ireland hence they avoid our tax. Just because they have some sort of headquarters in the UK doesn't mean the money will stay here. 

Technically that's totally legal but many people have argued an I kind of feel they're right, that profits made from UK people should be taxed as profits in the UK and should benefit people in the UK via the tax paid on it. Problem is in the EU companies can move capital from country to country freely in order to facilitate trade. That's great provided there is no difference in tax laws to be taken advantage of which of course there is. We need and EU-wide (preferably worldwide move to standardise tax and get rid of tax havens before anything can realistically change. My original point was merely that Eric Schmitt was being a bit of a douche-nozzle by pointing to Google's positive impact as if that makes it fine to avoid the law. No-one can force Google to have a positive impact and he's effectively saying 'You should all be pleased we aren't having a negative impact with the money were not giving you. You'd be helpless either way because were avoiding your law but aren't you pleased were being good'.

* UK are island nations with nuclear deterrent and a good navy. This gives us great protection against climate refugees that should be expected many years down the line. Furthermore they have to work through most of mainland Europe, some of which will also be ok (relative to what it could be).

Plus, Carlisle is chiefly notable for being on the England/Scotland border on the West side, which means the equivalent East coast counterpart would be Berwick, but that's a lot farther North.

Basically people have looked at a map, added two and two together and come up with five.

The driver it would seem got annoyed with the cyclist cycling in the middle of the lane *, tried to squeeze an overtake * which resulted In the cyclists using his horn. This upset the driver so much he assaulted the cyclists.

The driver got a caution and nothing else. He has not been charged, he also apparently lied to the police before he knew there was footage of the assault..but regardless, he only got a caution.

As a result of this there has been a bit of a witch hunt against the driver, and the company he works for ...he is actualy married to the owner of the company even though the owner of the company said he had nothing todo with them (wanting to distance themselves from the driver/negative press). Generally a lot of cyclists are super angry at this.

The police asked the cyclist to remove the video from YouTube which he refused todo, as a result of that the attacker contacted Youtube to remove it, which they did.

This though has back fired for them. The video has been uploaded (apparently) 50 odd times now, and cycling groups world wide have been posting it. 

The company in question is a pet store that has children's activities, some (rightly if u ask me) are questioning them about children safety in light of this assult.

Very bad press for them.

* cyclists have every right to cycle in the middle of the lane, it's a recommended approach when cars/obstacles are to the left. People opening their doors into an oncoming cyclist kill around 15 a year.

true,Justintoxicated,null,null,"&gt;Psychic stuff is a real thing in Doctor Who

Yes but not among humans whom we understand biologically. Psychic powers in humans are a concept of fantasy not science fiction.

&gt; It's apparently fairly standard science (fiction) in Gallifrey

Gallifreyans are not human therefore biologically a shadow of doubt can be cast. Regeneration, multiple hearts, etc.. biologically they a different from humans therefore what is referred to as ""psychic"" (telekinetic is probably the more accurate term) could be explained semi-scientifically with a difference in biology that allows them to process cues (olfactory, electromagnetic, quantum forces, etc) humans cannot pick up. 

&gt;Even in general science fiction psychic communication is sometimes a thing

It all depends on how it is applied, if it's humans of the present day running around with psychic abilities with no mechanical assistance or biological changes it falls into the realm of fantasy, it is tantamount to magic which in general is a cop out and just plain lazy writing. 

&gt;for all science fiction knows it's as possible as time travel

When you place the word ""science"" in front of fiction it suggests that there is a sphere of plausibility, otherwise it is just fantasy and you end up with magical centaurs galloping around looking for wizards. Time travel is  a fact, we are constantly traveling forward in time, while backwards travel is questionable there is enough plausibility for it to be in the realm of science fiction. 

&gt;So I think your rant is wrong

it's a rant, hence it is an opinion. 

My main issue is that lately more and more episodes have had leanings to huxterism, new age pseudoscience, and holisticism. Great science fiction is supposed to theorize on the great possibilities and wonders that can possibly exist in the multiverse and expand our creative horizons, wet the mental palette so that one day someone may realize these possibilities (or dismiss them entirely). When good science fiction starts lending credence to present day charlatanism it loses the wonder evoked by the subtle intangible quality that is remote plausibility, the quality that plays off our desire to advance as a species and uncover the secrets of our universe.

true,Agmedal,null,null,"Chelsea fan here. We don't hate him because he is good or he tied a game we were winning. We respect good players. A small part of me was actually happy when for example Sturridge scored. He had a hard time in Torres' shadow when he was with us and probably would have got a lot more game-time at another club, and so his ""shoot at every touch"" and ""never pass"" mentality could be understood because he had so few opportunities to impress at Chelsea, and needed to make every one count. 

Most Chelsea fans I know have huge respect for Gerrard. We don't hate him because he's good, we respect him because he's good, and more than that he plays with passion for his club and always gives 100%.

No, why we are upset today is i.) the unfairness the game going against us at various points and ii.) the sickening on-field actions of Suarez. 

The unfairness: Be honest, how many of you when ""6 minutes"" flashed up for extra time thought ""yeah, that seems about right for this game""?  The Sturridge ""tackle"" on Bertrand: Okay in real-time maybe a ref might have missed it, but on replay do you really think it was the right decision? If that had happened to one of your players you would have rightly expected a red card. We have had significant decisions go against us at various points in the season, some of them had a huge impact on our season e.g. the first Man U game of the season when we were unbeaten, had won away at Arsenal and Tottenham and could have gone 7 points clear - most neutrals agree that the Torres sending off for ""diving"" reducing us to nine men was bullshit. 

So to be scored against in the 7th minute of a 6 minute extra time by a player who had bitten one of our players, yeah we kinda think that stinks. It's not because he's good (a lot of Chelsea post-game comments were along the lines of why would such a talented player do something like that?) and it's not because he scored, it's because he bit someone, and then scored at the end of a game which went against us, like it seems to have done all season.

The bite: I know a lot of Liverpool fans have condemned his actions so I don't really need to explain this one. Biting is worse than spitting and is just below injuring someone deliberately to take them out of the game. But in addition to that, it's by a guy who has a reputation for being a sketchy player and has actually bitten someone else previously. So that's why we hate him.  

If you had won the game by playing like you did when you bossed our midfield in the first 10-15 minutes, we would have said fair play - heck we even respected QPR when they beat us because we played like shite that day and they wanted it more. But today's game was not left up to just the talent of the two teams. ",0,1366641046,null,0,false,0,c9k9b3o,t3_1ctpyo,t1_c9k9b3o,t1_c9k0qwt,null,1431469949,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Against Man City with a congested midfield, and no natural width Bale was ineffective in the middle and couldn't find any space between the lines (Barry and Toure both sat back as deep-lying playmakers), nor could any of our midfield get enough time on the ball to thread him through. Essentially Bale should of copied Tevez, he was a lot more comfortable playing off the striker and it's no surprise their goal game when Tevez drifted out wide before crossing for Nasri. When Bale did move out wide in the second half he had a lot more influence.

When Defoe and Lennon are fit, it would make perfect sense to start him in this central role. Lennon could hug the touchline whilst Defoe's pace and runs will drag CBs out of position leaving a much larger area for Bale to work in (see Arsenal).

true,poteland,null,null,"&gt;Psychic powers in humans are a concept of fantasy not science fiction.

Again: your premise is wrong just because you decide that psychic powers are outside of the realm of science fiction, which you don't present a good reason to assert.

The TARDIS communicates with humans via a psychic link, the psychic paper alters and perception filters work on humans, in the Torchwood institute (when Rose goes in there with the psychic paper) they mention to have psychic training to withstand minor psychic attacks such as not beeing fooled by the paper. there is nothing to indicate that humans can't be psychics. It's just another element that falls in the ""for all we know impossible technology that is real in the show, explained by sufficiently advance technology"". *Exactly* like the kind of time travel we have in the show, which is not plausible in any way according to our current understanding of the universe.

In the plot of Asimov's foundation (which I think qualifies as science fiction) humans develop psychology to a level where psychic ""powers"" (telepathy, mind control, etc) are possible, this comes obviously after years of research, training and learning, in one of the books though there is a human which is able to use a rough and limited (but powerful) version of their psychic abilities because of a genetic mutation.

So my point is: you are forgetting the ""fiction"" part in ""science fiction"", according to the show psychic stuff is standard and has been for years and not really explained, just as a huge amount of other things, so it's not outside the realm of possible exceptionally advanced science. 

To quote Clarke: 

&gt; Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

and 

&gt; When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.

So don't come telling me that somehow psychic stuff is less plausible that the time vortex, eye of harmony and rebooting the damn universe. It's damn arrogant.

The problem with it as an attitude is that it ignores what you might fear next week; only considering what you fear today.  Governments around the world are not above retrospective laws -- when they apply them, what stops them going through all your past history to see if you have infringed in the past?

What about someone like me, who posts fairly negative things about the government on the Internet?  I'm (like most loud mouths) all talk and no boots; and completely not a threat.  Governments aren't above tracking people who say negative things though; and eventually I could end up on a no-fly list.  For doing nothing more than saying ""I don't trust government"".

I suffer from PTSD, I haven't been outside on my own for over 3 years and when I do it's necessity for things such as doctors appointments and so on. I was called in to one of these meetings for an assessment and I was in a bad way. 

I *was* on my way to recovery, even hoping to get work with a buddy system I was promised to have someone to take me to and from work (which of course never materialised). But i'd had an unfortunate experience in a hospital and this had given me somewhat of a set back when coupled with a recent death of a friend.

The man was outright hostile, he spent most of the time making me do the physical assessments even though I told him straight away that my problem was mental. After it had been done he basically just threw an accusation in my face, ""We would expect that you have gotten over this by now"" I was just in shock, who says that? A medical assessment telling me to just ""get over"" PTSD? So I sat and nodded looking at the floor. ""Well you're too young to be traumatised aren't you, I bet you're at the pub every weekend with your boyfriend"". I just said ""ok"" I didn't know what else to do I was in tears. He said he would cross check my story with my doctor and asked me to sign to agree to that so I did. Then I later found out he sent it to a doctor miles away instead and filled it with lies about my body language, eye contact and so on making it out like I wasn't anxious, he even said ""She was laughing as she spoke about this"" about something, I really gave out a nervous laugh when describing how my clothes were dirty 'cause I was too depressed to keep clean, you know those ones that are barely more than an exhale through your nostrils when you say something embarassing? Just as an idea of how he twisted shit. He said I was maintaining eye contact and shit when I was terrified.

Even now it makes me cry just thinking about how powerless being in that room made me feel. I wanted so much to go to tribunal but I was so scrared after that, they wouldnt accept medical evidence either so I didn't know how to go about it, I didn't even want the money. I would have rejected it if it meant this guy lost his job but I just couldn't face it.

Then I went online and found lots of other people, especially those with PTSD telling the same story, in fact many told of winning at tribunal only to be called into an asessment again at the earliest chance and having to restart the whole process. How damaging that must be for them is heartbreaking. I've been without any money at all for 2 years now, my mother is stretched to the limit having to care for me. It's not good.

This refers to you, once at home, having to change the tape each day following the surgery, as you usually need to remove the shield and pad to apply drops. Surgical tape doesn't stick back down too well after removal, so you can't keep using the original pieces they used.

It's a good idea to obtain it, as they suggest, before you have the surgery in case you can't pop out to the shops after. It's also advisedo buy a pack of cotton wool pads, as they cushion the plastic eye shield.

true,robertpeacock22,null,null,"We set ours to generate the most heat possible and to release the least heat possible, and there was still barely any heat left in them by the time I got home most days. I mean in fairness, this winter was something of an exception. That said, however, there's nothing saying next winter won't be as well.

An additional problem with storage heaters is that they tend to come with a two-tier electricity plan. The whole reason they exist is so that you can leverage the lower-rate overnight tier to make heat, and then during the day you don't need to use the higher-tier rate as much. There are a few problems with this logic though, the first being that even the lower-rate tier is more expensive with gas, the second being that (as in my case) you end up buying a space heater anyway, and the third being that people use a lot more electrical stuff now than ever before, so your laptop, tv, etc. are all running at the higher tier between the hours of ~8AM and ~11PM. And make no mistake, if you're on a two-tier plan the lower tier is cheaper than a regular plan, but the higher tier is definitely more expensive than a regular plan.

The storage heater thing isn't the end of the world, but you will definitely want to consider investing in hot water bottles, fleece sheets, and the like to try and mitigate the cost of them (or to allow you to not use them at all).",0,1366642703,null,0,false,0,c9k9tlw,t3_1cuu3p,t1_c9k9tlw,t1_c9k7frd,null,1431469707,2,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,2

What I hate the most is when people are using a throwaway *and* say nothing about themselves.  What do you expect people to start a conversation with you about?  I actually met my boyfriend on Reddit, and even though he used a new throwaway, he posted a good few long paragraphs about himself.

I feel kind of bad for the guys, but some of them put so little effort in, what do they expect?

&gt;The white van driver isnt doing anything bad by over taking him

Well...in and of itself overtaking a cyclists need never be bad. The issue here was the van did not allow enough space and cut in pretty sharpish. There was no allowance for additional space you should give vulnerable road users (highway code and all that). This is a pretty common occurrence for cyclists though. And it's one (of the many) reason I believe cyclists get a bad rep - Things like this happens, the cyclist gets angry (as you do when when cars speed past you at speed closely and unexpectedly) and the driver often never understands what he's done wrong.

It may seem minor from the perspective of a car (I drive too...) but when you're out and exposed on a bicycle with big metal things zooming past at anywhere from 30-60mph then any close call can feel terrifying. We try to keep situation awareness by glancing behind us as much as possible, but a combination of the wind noise and no rear-view mirror means that cars can suddenly 'appear' in the peripheral vision a lot of the time.

We finally saw him deployed in this role yesterday and he was fantastic. In that right position, he cannot be stopped. Close him down out wide and he cuts inside the fullback, play him to cut inside and he can race down the touchline and pull back to cross on his left. He can create space for himself out wide if he's a threat to cut in and shoot on his left. When he's on the left he's not as much of a threat to cut in because he's obsessed with shooting on his left.

And his mentality now is such that if he is fielded wide out on the left, he essentially won't do it and comes inside anyways. He did with Harry and he did it with AVB and I believe AVB yielded to this reality and fielded him centrally from the start.

A fully fit trio of Lennon on the left, Bale on the right and Defoe in the middle is tantalizing to think about it. All three have great pace, smart movement and two of the three are deadly threats to score and the other is perfectly happy supplying the other two.

With Huddlestone sitting deep the other two centermid spots can be filled by Holtby and Siggy and with Parker, Carroll and Dempsey on the bench AVB has options to change their approach by changing the makeup of the midfield three. Parker to shut the game down, Carroll to get the ball moving quicker when needed and Dempsey to...try really hard? I don't know, I don't care for Dempsey but if Spurs were chasing a match swamping him for a tiring Holtby or Siggy might spark something.
*Somehow forgot about Dembele here, It would be Hudd and Dembele with one of either Siggy or Holtby.

It's a lineup and formation that can work but with the makeup of the squad Lennon, Bale and Defoe have to be fit.

The rest of my family supported spurs, I didn't know why, and I didn't care, YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE!

 I had also gone from being a Montreal Canadiens baby to an Ottawa Senators fan when I moved to the city and was old enough to care. I even remember crying when the sens lost in the playoffs.

Then one day, my heritage started to matter to me... i switched back to my hometown team for hockey, and for the sake of my past  decided to find out why my family supported spurs. As it turns out, my great grandad had actually tried out for the team and had always been a big supporter. When his son (my mom's dad) swam over to Canada to marry my grandma brought his support with him.  Here I am maybe 4-5 years after my 'switch', haven't looked back since.

There is limited potential for producing gas from the disused coal mines of South Wales, and also the possibility of fracking for shale gas in the Vale of Glamorgan, but Wales lacks any great quantities of natural gas. Of course, the UK won't ever be self-sufficient again either,  thanks to the speed at which we ripped through the North Sea reserves. We won't be getting rid of the LNG terminals at Milford Haven any time soon.

I do find it interesting that you think Wales is ""fine as it is"", though. The country has been in an economic slump which has lasted since the First World War; a pretty much unbroken stagnation in our economy which has left us with a GVA per capita which is bumping along at a measly 75% of the UK average ([£15,696 in 2011](https://statswales.wales.gov.uk/Catalogue/Business-Economy-and-Labour-Market/Regional-Accounts/Gross-Value-Added-GDP/GVA-by-Component-WelshNUTS2Areas-Year)).

Sure, it is highly unusual, a tad strange and not exactly pleasant, however, this is contact sport we are talking about in a highly tense game - hardly a surprise that someone occasionally 'loses it'. 

Suarez is a footballer - he is not a politician, not a chess player, not a Buddhist monk and, most importantly, not a role model. He is trained to compete and trained to win. He has a bit of a temperament, to say the least, and occasionally does rather baffling things. We all know this and this event shouldn't really come as a shock. But he's a good footballer, which is why he is as highly regarded as he is. 

He broke a sport's rules and he will be punished accordingly. He has not destroyed the reputation of Liverpool (the city or the club), has not injured anyone and has admitted his mistake. People, including footballers, do far worse things than biting someone in the middle of a tussle.

true,Justintoxicated,null,null,"&gt;Again: your premise is wrong just because you decide that psychic powers are outside of the realm of science fiction.

Actually I stated that humans in the present day unaltered is outside the range of science fiction because it is completely outside the realm of science. 

&gt;In the plot of Asimov's foundation
We're talking Doctor Who science fiction outside the Doctor Who universe is irrelevant to the series unless it is specifically merged into the Doctor Who universe as cannon. 


&gt;there is nothing to indicate that humans can't be psychics

Biology. Legitimate science. Check out James Randi. 

&gt;The TARDIS communicates with humans via a psychic link, the psychic paper alters and perception filters work on humans

As I stated in my previous comment ""without mechanical assistance"", as in the the Tardis is mechanical assistance. 


&gt;they mention to have psychic training to withstand minor psychic attacks such as not being fooled by the paper

""Psychic paper was a blank, white card that had special properties. When shown to a person, it could usually induce them to see whatever the user wished them to see printed on it. However, it proved useless on geniuses such as William Shakespeare."" http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Psychic_paper

1. Psychic paper is basically an illusion trick in which people project onto it. So it's not actually reading anyone's mind. 

2. As a device (foreign technology) it falls under mechanical assistance. 

&gt;So don't come telling me that somehow psychic stuff is less plausible that the time vortex, eye of harmony and rebooting the damn universe

time vortex - essentially an interconnected series of wormholes, plausibly like a subway universe traveling outside the physics which operate in our universe. 

eye of harmony - essentially a black hole

rebooting the universe - actually under M-Theory and mathematical projection there could be infinite universes therefore the ""reboot"" would essentially just be different universe that is exactly the same except for one minute detail. It would just be a very close dimensional shift. 


&gt;because you decided that psychic powers are outside of the realm of science fiction: just as a huge amount of other things, so it's not outside the realm of possible exceptionally advanced science. 

Actually if you read carefully I stated that psychic powers (psychic is of course an umbrella term, like using the term ""transportation"" to describe a specific mode such as driving a car or walking) do fall within science fiction but not within the means of present day humans. I explicitly mentioned mechanical assistance (technology) and biological alteration (other species or evolved humans with organs capable of processing cues we are incapable of, for example sensing and processing neuro-electrical cues or heightened ability detect chemical release (sensing the release of dopamine, adrenaline, serotonin, any chemical occurrence in the brain))  

&gt; humans develop psychology to a level where psychic ""powers"" (telepathy, mind control, etc) are possible, this comes obviously after years of research, training and learning

The key words are psychology and training. He's not relying on magic powers but on reading cues. Also this is set in the future not the 1970's. 

&gt;genetic mutation.

This is where things become muddled. The spontaneous development of psychic powers genetically is impossible. Evolution does not work like that, it is tantamount to a human being born with wings and an iphone for a hand. If he does state ""rough and limited"" it can fall into the realm of plausibility, after all a heightened sense of emotional contagion would fall in that range, even having a greater sense of smell could fall in that realm. The way they presented this girl however falls more in the range of the Oracle of Delphi than the range of Asimov, a man who was versed in legitimate science and very carefully made such conditions to add plausibility and keep things within the range of possible. 

I deal with people who run around calling themselves ""psychics"" or ""empaths"" on a daily basis and watch them prey on and bilk money out of desperate and ignorant people. So I'm not exactly a fan of anything lending credence to their ""mystical energies"" which cannot be scientifically described, measured, or reproduced in a neutral environment.

Just look at Cleverly for United. Sent out on loan, did a job at wigan and came back better. Now united have actually used a player that cares about the club rather than bringing in someone for 5m or so and he's done a good job for them. Over the past few seasons we've had similar situations, and shall continue to in the next few, McEachran probably being the next one who whilst cares about the club may have to seek his football elsewhere. It's frustrating for me, and I'm sure it is likewise for other fans.

Another problem being unless our manager situation stabilises will anyone give the youth a chance? At the expense of youth they want to secure their jobs against demands which even if met can lead you out of a job anyway.

Plates would be too small on a bike frame to over any real help

Cyclists are like pedestrians in the eyes of the law. If a cyclist does something illegal and skips the scene it's no different than if a pedestrian did it. Pedestrians don't have registration plates, same applies to cyclists.

Plates are used on cars because of the danger they pose. They are in all effect heavy machinery that cause 2k deaths and around 50k injuries per year. Bikes kills around 2 people a year (not sure of injury figures) and as a result is seen as a very very low priority when it comes to danger. Then I suppose cost/value of stolen is also a concern. Most bikes are relatively cheap.

Also...kids. I'm not sure adding a costly addition of a number plate would help kids cycle. Nor would it encourage any cycling which unlike most driving has multiple positives for society.

It has been tried before in other nations. The only nation it's remained in is Japan. All other nations abolished it when it became clear the cost outweighed the benefits.


It has been discussed many times, and like helmet compulsion it never gets anywhere.

There is a large population of ethnic minorities and as such more people from those racial groups are going to be stopped and searched. The Met also released data that showed that victims and witnesses most commonly reported the suspect as being black. Whilst the Met has made no comment on that officially I believe that it is most likely going to be an economic factor rather than racial. That is to say that ethnic minorities make up a significant proportion of society's poor.

Generally most won't do stops without some kind of reason for doing it.

Think of it like heating up a pan on a stove. The doctor hooks up the tardis to that eye shard and charges it. The girl makes the psychic connection and creates the wormhole. At this point the pan is fully heated and time is synced up. 

The woman is saved, and the wormhole closes; aka the stove is unplugged. The pan is still hot, and it wouldn't take much to get it back to full tempature. But as it is still cooling down, the connection is still there, holding the universes in sync, but it is slowly losing power. 

The psychic then opens the connection again, but she doesn't need the power of the tardis, since the pan is already heated up. She is just trying to fry an egg on the residual heat. The tardis then flies through the wormhole, grabs the doctor and they escape back through the wormhole before it closes again.

You're correct about Hillsborough being a cop out, but IMO Suarez has done just about everything he should have done after the match. While it in no way makes his actions any more acceptable, at least he immediately owned up to his actions and apologized to Ivanovic, who (very graciously) accepted.

Possibly the **only** good thing I can say about Suarez in this whole incident is that he at least isn't trying to sugar-coat this or hide from his vile actions.

I'm still disgusted, but it at least gives you *some* hope that the man has some humanity left. 

I think we'll see if there's still a chance for Suarez to salvage himself and his career in the next few months. He's said the right words, now it's time to speak with his actions.

This cyclist is pretty self-entitled if you ask me...I ride with a camera myself but this guy seems to be looking for trouble.

Having the horn to beep at somebody AFTER the incident? Rookie mistake. A horn is to alert others of your presence. The van driver is aware of your presence, he just doesn't care. Beeping at him is a sign of aggression and a key indicator that you're looking for confrontation. For this you have every right to report him for dangerous driving, but beeping AFTER the fact? That is just a sure way to initiate a confrontation.

Also shaking his head at the other motorist gives a sense of self-entitlement that I'm not liking. If somebody isn't the best driver in the world and they require a second attempt at parallel parking, what right do you have to shake your head in disapproval? Again, negative body language which can initiate a confrontation.

The fact is once something has happened...keep your cool.

You have it on video, so why escalate the situation? If you get angry and enraged at one event, you may not see the next one coming and it could be fatal. (For example cycling straight across an intersection whilst the van driver is giving chase).

This was reckless behavior by both the van driver and the cyclist.

Once you give up your privacy like this you will never get it back. And the uses for such data will grow and grow. That is inevitable. I don't trust my government to run a system like this nor do I trust the private sector. Do you know how many breaches of data happen in the private sector? ALL the bloody time.

I've got a personal example where my car got towed away by Tower Hamlets council. When I got to the car storage I had a bunch of my personal documentation, drivers license, some utility bills etc.. All scanned by an employee of a 3rd party company who had a contract to run the system, all to be uploaded to some server somewhere possibly to be skimmed by some minimum wage IT worker in fucking god knows where. Given how these contracts work they could have a processing company offshore who also have access to do the data entry.

This. As a driver i used to fire off a BEEP when some fucker cut me up or something.

Bike or not beeping at wankers after they've been wankers will get you into fights. It's not right and it's not fair that they can get away with driving like cunts.

Anyway the guy in the video clearly doesn't think any of the following rules apply to him -

**Rule 147:**

Be considerate. Be careful of and considerate towards all types of road users, especially those requiring extra care (see Rule 204). 

You should

* try to be understanding if other road users cause problems; they may be inexperienced or not know the area well

* **not allow yourself to become agitated or involved if someone is behaving badly on the road. This will only make the situation worse. Pull over, calm down and, when you feel relaxed, continue your journey**

* slow down and hold back if a road user pulls out into your path at a junction. Allow them to get clear. **Do not over-react by driving too close behind to intimidate them**

**Rule 152:**

Residential streets. 

* You should drive slowly and carefully on streets where there are likely to be pedestrians, cyclists and parked cars. In some areas a 20 mph (32 km/h) maximum speed limit may be in force. Look out for

* **cyclists** and motorcyclists.

**Rule 160:** 

Once moving you should

* be aware of other road users, **especially cycles** and motorcycles who may be filtering through the traffic. These are more difficult to see than larger vehicles and their riders are particularly vulnerable. **Give them plenty of room**, especially if you are driving a long vehicle or towing a trailer

**Rule 163**

Overtake only when it is safe and legal to do so. You should

* not get too close to the vehicle you intend to overtake

* move quickly past the vehicle you are overtaking, once you have started to overtake. Allow plenty of room. Move back to the left as soon as you can but **do not cut in**

* give motorcyclists, cyclists and horse riders **at least** as much room as you would when overtaking a car (see Rules 211 to 213 and 214 to 215). 

**Rule 167**

**DO NOT** overtake where you might come into conflict with other road users. For example

* where the road narrows

**Rule 212**

When passing motorcyclists and cyclists, **give them plenty of room** (see Rules 162 to 167). If they look over their shoulder it could mean that they intend to pull out, turn right or change direction. Give them time and space to do so.

Oh and while it's not in the highway code I'm pretty sure assault is covered in the law elsewhere...

If we want to get really pedantic about the rules, rule 169 applies if you are **driving** a large or slow moving vehicle. You don't drive a bicycle, you ride it...

[2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_st29mlQwU)


In both of these cases the ball was just a useful convenience in their attacks on the other players. While what Suarez did was disgusting, to suggest that it is worse than either of these is crazy.

In Suarez' case he knew he wasnt going to cause lasting damage to his victim, but just seriously piss him off. It may have been the red mist setting in or it may have been a ridiculous ploy to win a penalty, but either way it's not something that could end anyone's career, apart from his own perhaps.

*Edit: Just for good measure, here's a [Muscat tackle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iSNw6N5EtM) which quite possibly tops the lot.

true,KopOut,lfc68,null,"Alright, the first tackle (by Cantona) is the only one that I can understand why people view it as worse than a bite. I can understand it because he attacks the player from behind, and has no chance of getting the ball which all point to intent, AND I understand that in principle that action is much more dangerous injury-wise (in most cases) than a bite would be.

BUT, he did take a player off the ball, and ended a scoring threat (albeit against the rules) so while I know what his intent was and it is deplorable, it is still part of the action of the game. He was red carded and sent off as the rules dictate etc.

The other two tackles, while awful and certainly meriting red cards are from in front of a player and ostensibly involve an attack on the ball or could be construed that way by some. For that reason I don't think it is as bad as a bite.

It is very hard to describe because it makes it sound like I am okay with the tackles you link to (which I am in not in anyway), but however nuts it may sound you can make a partial case for why they would occur, and could occur naturally in the game (Cantona, admittedly, being a huge stretch). 

In other words, I can think of a thousand ways a person could kick someone in the thigh with their studs in the game, or fly over a ball and clear the legs of an attacker or hit someone with studs in the back of the leg and not mean it, while I can't think of a single scenario in the course of a match where a player would accidentally find his teeth wrapped around a chunk of another players body and bite down on it.",1,1366658251,null,0,false,0,c9kfbpu,t3_1cv7tk,t1_c9kfbpu,t1_c9kew41,null,1431467041,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

&gt;He's a bigger scumbag than el Haj diouf

I can't really comment on this, since this was before my time as a football fan. Suarez is an absolute prick and has done some miserable things on the pitch. But I still believe that Suarez is still actually a good person off the pitch. Everything I've ever heard or seen of him agrees with this, he's a gentle and kind person and a great family man. 

The problem is that he can be a fucking lunatic when he's on the pitch.

Thanks for your respectful opinion and this discussion. I guess I'm just not quite willing to write off Suarez as a person or a footballer yet. IMO, Liverpool should punish him harshly - on top of whatever the FA does - but should not ostracize him. Suarez gives his heart and soul to the club on the pitch, and he should never walk alone. 

I'm willing to forgive, under the right circumstances, but I don't think we should ever forget, trivialize, or otherwise rationalize what he did yesterday. It was despicable and a stain on Suarez and LFC, and something that has no place in football. 

I think LFC should suspend him for an additional 3-5 games without pay on top of the FA's actions. But I also believe Suarez *can* control his anger and become a better person from this. I'll admit some selfish motivations - I don't want to see my club lose it's best, most exiting player. But I also think Suarez is more than just the sum of his worst moments. He's a sublime footballer, plays with passion and always gives his best, he's loyal and fierce, and he never gives up. Off the pitch he's generous, kind, gentle, and he loves his wife and kids. The optimist in me has to believe the good in him can overcome the bad, but he's officially run of out of chances to grow up. 

Gary Neville actually just had some excellent [commentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=AC7Q-rR-l4Y) on this matter that sums up my feelings nicely. He's fucked up, massively, and deserves punishment and ridicule.

I'm not quite sure if I'm correct there - will we still be British if independence happens? I'm not too bothered though as it's just a wind up.

Anyone who takes their nationality so seriously needs to have the piss taken out of them. Likewise any Scot who hates the English so much they won't admit to being British needs it rubbed in their face as often as possible.

Equality is great and should be the default, I think, but there are still two distinct genders with their differences and to treat each gender exactly the same in every situation isn't right to me. I'm not saying that men and women should be treated differently all of the time, but take the paternity leave thing. To me it makes more sense for the mother to be afforded more time than the father because the mother is just naturally much more well equipped to keep the baby healthy and alive, because e's a big cuddly food dispenser. Father's should definitely be allowed time off in the early stages but should be expected to return to work sooner than the mother; because looking after a baby of a few months is hard as hell. I only feel that way because it'd be better for the kid and everybody concerned, not from a particularly male perspective. The only thing I can think of is rape allegations, and how stacked they are in the woman's favour, but even with only these two issues it hardly requires an entire torch-burning mob to campaign all the time for it.

However, having lived and learned I can say I don't beep, shout or scream when something goes down.

A friend of mine (on motorcycles) often parks in front of the 'offender', gets off his bike and intimidates them. I mean, he does it in a friendly was such as walking over and pointing at the mirrors...No vulgar language or violence intended.

However, I know this is just a way to cause trouble, and so I just let it go and hope the driver has learnt from it. Life is too short to go around feeling all high and mighty because you scorned somebody for making a mistake, especially with the risks involved.

Your analogy, of the rape victim...

It would be more accurate to say beeping at the van, is the equivalent of the rape victim showing the offender her tits and explaining how he can't have them...just enraging him more.

Now she wouldn't 'deserve' to be raped, as nobody 'deserves' to be raped...however she would have encouraged the act by provoking a reaction where the sensible thing would be to leave the potential offender alone ASAP.

Again to clarify, the van driver was 100% wrong to assault the cyclist, however he was not 100% to blame. I've 100% certainty he would have drove on and forgotten about the cyclist within 30 seconds if he hadn't beeped. But he had to beep.

I see your point about his skills being wasted as an anchor, but in our midfield it's a very important role.

Against packed defenses and for variety, his sense of when to get forward is invaluable, but I'd like to see Dembele playing with the same freedom and confidence he had when beside Sandro.  

I also agree on the Vidal comparison, but Vidal doesn't play as the deepest midfielder.

did you know there are places like [Citizens Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice.htm) which can help you with benefits and things ? 
also you can write to your local MP for help - http://www.writetothem.com/ - they might be able to get the benefits agencies to sort things out.

You'd probably enjoy S1E6 *Dalek*. It's darker, more serious, life and limb on the line. In fact, you'll find that while Series (or Season) One has a lot of camp, it probably gets darker than most of the rest of Doctor Who.

Further episodes of Series One I'd recommend: *The Empty Child*/*The Doctor Dances* (S1E9-10), *Boom Town* (S1,E11), and *Bad Wolf*/*Parting of the Ways* (S1,E12-13).

I'd also suggest *The Impossible Planet*/*The Satan Pit* (S2,E8-9), as it has a bit of a Firefly-esque flair (nothing too overt, though). 

But it seems what you're really looking for is Torchwood, Doctor Who's more serious and adult spinoff. In many ways it is to Doctor Who what DS9 was to TNG, although they are certainly more sexual.

If you're looking to get into Torchwood, I suggest beginning at the start of Season Two and working your way towards the *superb* ""Children of Earth"" season-long story.

Make of this what you will, I'm not condoning, or advocating this...

Iv heard two stores recently where girls have been stopped on the pavement by police. When questioned why, they express concern about the safety of the road. At this point the policemen has to make a judgment, and can let them off of the fine/offence and give them a verbal warning or give them an on the spot fine.

I have no idea if this is true, but I do suspect there is an element of truth to it. Only because I know that if someone feels their life is in threat self preservation can supersede the Highway Code, in much the same way as a car might mount a curb to avoid another vehicle. 

Regarding cycling on the path in general though. It's strange how its become totally acceptable to park on the pavement...I mean, they had to get on the pavement somehow.

What is a genuine issue with pavements though is is shared paths and bad signage, or abrupt endings to cycle Lanes. 

Here's another second hand fact (or not) I read - you know those advanced cycle boxes? Well, if you see a car in one by law it's seen as jumping a light as carries a £35 fine. The interesting thing about it is a few cyclists got together and under the freedom of information act asked police forces how many cars has been fined (over the previous year I'm guessing).

In any case though your mum may want to give up hairdressing, or more to a different place where she's directly employed. I always advise self employed people they need to earn at least an extra 1/3rd to make up for being self employed. 

Your mum is working 40 hours a week, and should earn 247.6 per week, at the minimum wage. Self employed to make up for the lack of benefits she should be earning 321.88, roughly. Any less and she should look for full time employment on minimum wage.

City beat all the top teams this season, which means we should've been more than capable to beat the ones further town the table.

No, what lost us the title this year was bad mentality. After last season this was my biggest concern, because you could kind of see it on the squad. These are players who are professional, but to some extent a bit cocky. I don't think anyone from the United squad would dare to go out on the pitch in the same sense as City did at times this season, and that's a shame. Mancini needs time to get respect from his own players, and he needs to make it absolutely clear that failure is not an option. I'm happy about a strong position in the leauge, but it's sad to know it could have been a lot better.

If we opened the door to EU residents being able to come here and get their incomes topped up by tax credits as soon as they arrived, because they were working as a ""self employed"" person, essentially being paid well under minimum wage then we'd have a big, big problem.

That's why I think the benefits system must be designed to prevent people like your mum being able to claim tax credits. I am guessing of course, but it makes sense.

As far as I can gather the system is designed to make sure that people who come here have to be able to support themselves at least initially before turning to tax credit top-ups, which I feel were designed to get the extant population working, rather than attract immigrants.

true,heggory,logo,,"I don't see why this got downvoted, you make a good point. We had a lot of performances where we just seemed slack and where we could have and should have easily picked up points where we didn't. Perfect example was the Spurs game. We looked great the first half, but we took our foot off the gas. It's evident enough in our W-D-L record this season. Up until yesterday, we had the exact same amount of losses as United, but 5 more draws. We were easily the better side when it came to the bigger club matches, but United were just better over the course of the season. My guess is the only reason you got downvoted is for what you said about United players never going out with the same mentality we had in some games. I don't entirely agree either, considering there were plenty of games where they probably should have dropped points but were fortunate to do so such as the 3-4 win against Reading where they managed three points despite conceding three to the worst team in the league. Van Persie was definitely not a 1-man team type figure, he just came up with a lot of clutch goals throughout the season to bag United 3 points. We needed our strikers to do exactly what he did, but unfortunately they couldn't provide that. Aguero, Tevez, and Dzeko were all slow to start getting into good goal scoring form, and unfortunately as much as I like Dzeko, his hasn't improved much, but he also hasn't gotten much playing team recently either. Each of them were HUGE for us last season and they just weren't up to that level this season. Our midfield definitely needs stengthening as well. Barry has had good performances here and there but not consistently. With Rodwell constantly out with injury, Garcia mostly being uninfluential, Nasri being inconsistent, and Yaya missing a big portion of the season with the ACON, our midfield struggled and thankfully Kompany, Nastasic, Clichy, and Zabaleta turned up huge on defense. Nastasic and Zabaleta have easily been our best defenders all season, and hopefully Kompany will get back to full form because his display against Spurs was pretty poor. If we can get back into the type of form we were in last season next year, I have no doubts that we'll take the title back, especially if we manage to bring in good players over the summer.",1,1366673118,null,0,1366673315,0,c9kktri,t3_1cw305,t1_c9kktri,t1_c9kk4d9,null,1431464378,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

true,Crommy,eng-essex,Essex,"PFI is essentially a tool that has been used to get large capital projects ""off the books"", thus balancing budgets for whatever government pursues it.

Say you want to build a new hospital, and it'll cost £300 million. £300 million is a hard sale for a government, that's a lot of money from the NHS budget to cough up in one go. If instead you pay £10 million per annum for the next 30 years (plus **a lot** of interest, on top of inflation), well, that's a figure that's a lot more manageable from this year's budget. It could be the difference between balancing the budget and overspending, and, politically, overspending is risking your career.

Unfortunately the terms of these PFI contracts are so heavily favoured towards the private investor, the public sector pays more and still saddles all the risk. £300 million is a lot of money for a private investor to invest with, and they're going to want a pretty hefty guaranteed profit. They can demand such heavy interest on the public repayments of said investment because the government pushing for the deal is desperate to not spend that £300 million all in one go. The PFI contract has still heaped all the risk on the public sector due to this contract **and** the public sector ends up paying a lot more over the length of the contract than they would have done upfront.

Want to know why the South London NHS Healthcare Trust went bust? It was because there PFI repayments were huge. So huge in fact, they could no longer keep up. Yes, it turns out the budgeting for repayments also turns out to be terrible.

So PFI schemes do get private investment (although hilariously in 2009, the government actually gave loans to private firms in order to invest in PFI (yes, that means giving the private sector public funds so they could then be paid by the public sector for what they did with those funds, adding profit and management fees into the mix)), but the public is in a lose-lose (spending and risk) situation. But hey, at least the government didn't overspend too much this year. Their ministers might even get re-elected.

All she says is that he should go back to his own country, which isn't racist.

To start off: yeah, you're probably right regarding why I was being downvoted at first. There are times when the United players don't play to the best of their ability, and I'm sorry for not making my point clear enough. I was kind of trying to say that *if* they didn't perform then they'd really hear it, and pick themselves up quickly, or else they'd be out of the team.

I totally agree with you on our defence. Massive credit to that back four! Zaba has become a role model for all footballers by playing the game the way it should be played. With commitment, honesty, respect and whole-hearted effort. Nastasic too has had a great debut season, and credit to Mancini for introducing him in the manner that he did. Kompany has, as we all know, been unlucky with injuries, but has still conveyed himself in an impressive way. Our little French leftie has without doubt evolved a lot as a footballer since arriving at City, and it's great to see him wear the shirt with a sense of pride.

It's easy to look back on last summers transfer window and blame that a lot for the outcome of this season. And yeah, it might possibly have mattered quite a lot. A team aiming to become the best in the world just can't do that by recruiting players like Sinclair, Rodwell and Garcia. All in all they've been mediocre, and that's just not enough. It's not an 11 man team's effort. Hopefully at least Sinclair, Kolo and Lescott can go to some other big teams in the summer.

He knows he could use Clara as a hostage to get the Doctor's name out of him, but he also knows that the Doctor has to have an intense feeling of responsibility towards her for him to give something like that up. His plan is not only to get the Doctor to care about Clara by making him feel responsible for her deaths, but to make the doctor interested in finding out more about her which would lead the doctor (somehow, I haven't figured that out yet) to the GI. The Faux Claras are meant to make the Doctor care and be interested in Clara, thus making her a high stakes hostage for the Doctor.

As for the Dalek thing, I thought that the security only turned them into those half-human half-Dalek things, although I could be wrong. Anyways, the GI has a faux Clara (I love this term, thank you for it) land there so the Doctor can meet her and gain his respect (she did help him through a horde of insane Daleks) without actually having to see what she looks like. If he didn't do that an the Doctor had seen what she looked like, then the Doctor would have investigated the 19th century Clara and realized she was a copy.

Also, as to how the GI knew what would happen on the planet, he is the Great Intelligence after all. I'd be more surprised if he didn't know what was going on.

Finally, my theory as to how the GI can travel throughout time is due to the fact that he has no body of his own, and thus would not be harmed by traveling through time without a machine. He's appeared in episodes in the classic series placed after the snowmen and before the Bells, and if he lived in a linear style, he would have prepared for the Doctor when he met him in his 2nd incarnation. However, he did not prepare or know about the Doctor before hand although he would have met him in the snowmen before he met the 2nd Doctor.

Hope this answers your questions. It is just a theory though, and it is a bit far from perfect.",0,1366675858,null,0,false,0,c9klsvn,t3_1ctkii,t1_c9klsvn,t1_c9kevku,null,1431463919,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,calgil,judoon,Judoon,"As I've said elsewhere and others have said, a lot of the ghostly effects were not explained when it was decided it wasn't really a ghost, and the episode capitulated on itself with the mechanics of the pocket universe. Doctor Who is a smart show with smart writers that don't need to make such glaring errors.

That said, I thought this was the most enjoyable show so far. In the last two I thought Clara was a forgettable piece of the furniture, but in this one I respected her a bit more. The 'we're just ghosts to you, aren't we?' seemed to come from nowhere and the episode was all the better for it. Her questioning the Doctor, perhaps distrusting him, might be something that sets her apart from all previous companions. Rose, Amy and Donna were all too trusting - Clara is not. And rightfully so, to be honest - the Doctor is treating her like a puzzle to be solved, not a person. 

Back to the 'we're all just ghosts to you' thing - I enjoyed the dark implications here, something I haven't really considered before. Everytime the Doctor moves forward a good while in time, everyone in that previous time dies - or they become 'dead', as they've technically been dead for a while. If he's in 2001 London, Amy is alive and well somewhere...fastforward 300 years to whatever's happening in Cardiff at the time, and in that instant of time travel, Amy crumples into dust in the ground. So essentially all the people in the universe that he has been close to, they ARE constantly dying. In a way, causing the universe to relive their death again. Oddly unsettling thought.

And you meet them and you think, ‘Not bad, they’re okay,’ and then when you get to know them… Their face just sort of becomes them, like their personality’s written all over it, and they just – they turn into something so beautiful.

To say the only vested interest an ex-UVF terrorist had was peace and the poor is laughable. He was the political front for a paramilitary force. That he might have come across as dead on or whatever is no substitute for being a good role model. 

He may have seen the error of his ways (that's what prisons generally do to criminals) but the stuff I read from nationalists who regularly blow smoke up his now gone arse are more telling of their own psychological weaknesses: the existence of an elected UVF terrorist made them feel better about voting SF.

In terms of comparing terrorists yes he was likely the best of a bad bunch but to say he put 'social and economic issues first' unlike exclusively democratic politicians is again an opinion without evidence: David Ervine never had an executive role in a government. His opinions were never tested.

Ervine was as fond of rhetoric as any other elected representative: He just chose a different language and could tell a story better. None of that changed working class lives - it just gave them a figurehead that douchebag forum members couldn't easily churn out crap memes about. Still, maybe that's the sum total of today's instademocracy.

I spent time several years ago with his brother Brian and like his brother he was likeable, could tell a story and seemed to have the gift of making those around him feel at ease.

true,Syrae,tardis,TARDIS,"No, yeah, I totally agree. I'm honestly somewhat annoyed that it's so overplayed in the genre, but at this point I doubt there's much you can do to erase that kind of trope shorthand for why we want to have our protagonists succeed. 

Moffat definitely has this thing about timey-wimey stuff. Even his stories in RTD's era had a big chunk of that. Doctor Who historically certainly had a fair amount of ""we can't let [badguy] destroy [time]!"" as well.
 
Personally, I'm liking the Clara arc more than his previous Moffat meta arcs if only because it doesn't seem so in your face as some of the prior arcs have been. I mean, yeah, every episode it's all, ""SHE IS IMPOSSIBLE!"", but it's not nearly as annoying as killing off the Doctor in the first episode or crack in the wall everywhere. 

I do miss the subtlety of RTD's hint drops (the Vote Saxon posters or the Bad Wolf references) that gave us a meta thread without actually making us wade through a blatant mystery that we wouldn't see the answer to for months.

Now that I think about it, the meta story lines in Supernatural don't bother me this much, but that may be because there's actually *progress* made on them in most episodes whereas Moffat sets up something then just keeps reminding you about it for a season and *maybe* tosses you some new info ever 3-4 episodes. If he didn't constantly smack me around the head with things, I might not mind as much.

Regardless, I've already got a list of probable writers (and a favorite) I'd love to see take over the helm at some point.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I think Doctor Who's intense diversity effectively makes it many different shows strung together with the same name and characters and themes.

The actor, the location, the style, the sets. All of these things change to the point where it's almost a completely new show each and every iteration.

The feel you get from Troughton's era is very, very distinct to Pertwee's or Baker's or Davison's, and so you don't necessarily need to have seen them all to be a fan of one and be a fan of the Doctor and the show.

I think that there's an *enormous* richness to Classic Who that's *definitely* worth exploring, but I'm not so elitist to look down my nose at people who've only seen New Who and claim they aren't even Whovians.

_________

As for entering into Classic Who, I have a few suggestions:

First: Pace yourself. Classic Who was not designed for bingeing. You aren't meant to devour entire serials back-to-back-to-back. You need to mosey along, let episodes digest, take your time.

Second: Don't view it the same way you do New Who. With New Who (like most modern television) the idea is for you to view it like an event, like something happening right before your eyes that you happen to be witnessing.   
Don't watch Classic Who in this manner. Instead, think of it more like sitting in on a theater. You're watching a performance playing on a massive stage, enjoy it through that lens and you'll have a much better time.

Third: There are a few ideal starting points. As a general rule-of-thumb, episodes that introduce companions are generally good gateways.

* *An Unearthly Child*. No better place to begin than the beginning, but be warned: It is a very old serial and is quite dry at stretches.

* *Spearhead From Space*: The introduction of the Third Doctor and companion Liz Shaw

* *Terror of the Autons*: The introduction of companion Jo Grant, the Autons, and the Master

* *The Time Warrior*: The introduction of the incomparable Sarah Jane, Sontarans, and the word ""Gallifrey"". This marks the dwindling of Pertwee's era and a segue into Baker's

* *The Face of Evil*: Introduction of companion Leela

* *The Ribos Operation*: Introduction of companion Romana, beginning of the Key to Time storyarc (one of the best pieces of Classic Who, in my humble opinion)

* *The Keeper of Traken*: The introduction of companion Nyssa, the dwindling of Baker's era and transition into Davison's

* *Dragonfire*: The introduction of companion Ace (whose dynamic with the Doctor is just, well... aces).",0,1366678929,null,0,false,0,c9kmwo1,t3_1cwib7,t1_c9kmwo1,t3_1cwib7,null,1431463398,31,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,31

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"Yeah, I think that pretty much hits the nail on the head. We are, objectively speaking, probably the best team in England right now, and if we could be bothered, could probably beat any other team in the country in a given game, but too often this season it looked as though we couldn't be bothered. 

I will say that getting RvP and Hazard would probably have secured enough extra goals to secure the title, but we should have been able to win it easily even without their assistance. It's not like the acquisition of Van Persie made United a better side than us. I mean, if you look at United's squad, the only players who would get regular first team play in our squad would be Rooney, Vidic, and RvP. The rest of the squad wouldn't look too out of place in a Newcastle or Stoke shirt. Yes we fell well short of united in goal differential, and while RvP definitely played a part in United's surpassing us, it should aslo be noted that we fell well short of last years GD as well, which I believe was well in excess of United's at present, although I'd have to check. Some of this is due to Aguero being injured for more games than would be ideal, and selling Balo may have contributed too, but ultimately I think it is as much an attitude thing as any.

We were able to beat them last year when they were racked by injury (Vidic out the entire season, Rooney here and there) and had comparatively little attacking edge. This year they beat us when we had similar issues (Silva, Aguero, and Kompany being injured, and Balo being sold), so I think that shows that the two teams are really quite closely matched, but they beat us by more than we beat them, and the reason for that has to be attitude. 

Even with our star-studded squad, we were unable to secure the necessary victories to retain the title, and I attribute a lot of that to a lax attitude after last years win. The squad was aware of how good they could be and just assumed that that quality would secure the title, rather than actively trying to win it. I think losing it this year will be enough of a shock that next year we'll have more of an idea of what's required, but I wouldn't be surprised to see some players lose motivation before this season is over, which is dangerous, since we still have the FA cup to play for.

true,michael2l,null,null,"I think Neville does a good job of putting this in context.  I'm horribly embarrassed about what Suarez did as a Liverpool supporter, but at the same time there isn't one part of me that thinks of him as a bad person that I wouldn't want on my club.  He really hits the nail on the head about why this is so shocking to us, while noting that Suarez is from a much different culture.  I think Suarez has grown up playing a lot of football at a street level where there is no ref around to defend you from injury, and especially if you are smaller than other players you need to make sure you defend yourself on a certain level.  I don't think he's being malicious, but when the red mist descends for him I honestly think he becomes that little kid on the street again trying to defend himself against bigger players who's lives he's been making miserable all day with his skill and competitiveness.  You can see there's a very child-like quality to both the positive and negative sides of his play on the pitch and he needs to grow up and understand the aspects of that which aren't acceptable, and I think he will.  Again, though I think Suarez is misunderstood by his cultural isolation in this respect.  Think back to Huth's stamp on Suarez's chest, for which he doesn't even receive a ban or any sort of real public outcry even though it's 100% more dangerous in terms of actually causing real injury to another player.  And the reason Huth gets away with it is because unofficially there is a certain understanding that the English game is very physically aggressive relative to other leagues around the world, and that players will do as much of this as they can, and while we don't condone it we do accept it on some level.  Suarez fails to understand the cultural reasons for why Huth can get away with what he did and why he can't.

* Tackle, get the ball and give it to Dembele. (If not Dembele, the closest player who had the ability to make the game, like Bale - Sigurdsson - Lennon)

* Jump for the aerial balls coming into the box and actually have an aerial presence to head them away defensively.

* Get in there for offensive corners and make a nuisance because of his height and have a tall player mark him, therefore taking away the focus from Jan, Dawson, Ade, Bale.


While not doing the following (which is good):

* Try and be a creative midfielder.

* Driving forward with the ball and therefore making Dembele sit back to cover.


Yeah - he's obviously a better fit with someone like Dembele around and Sandro understood that very well. Next year with him in defensive midfield and with Kaboul around as well (even though Dawson + Vertonghen is LOVE) our defense should potentially be VERY good. Benny showed some drive and some regaining of confidence with his performance against City (dodging players, faking them, making the odd interception and being tight on players) and if Walker can add some positioning into his defensive play he will be one of the best right backs in the world.

That's right, I said best right backs. He has a good shot on him, he has great height, good physical presence and that pace...",0,1366691192,null,0,false,0,c9kr8kc,t3_1cv9km,t1_c9kr8kc,t3_1cv9km,null,1431461357,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,eoz,null,null,"You can rent a place fairly central for ~£600, which would leave your budget a little tight but it's doable. With housemates you can probably get it down to £300-£350.  Be warned: if you live with non-students then the household will be liable for council tax and you should ensure that your housemates don't expect you to split it with them if you move in to such a place - it could run you to another £30-£40 a month.

I'd suggest living within walking distance of uni - it's a very walkable city and you'll save time and money on busses.  The cost of travel cards will run you to £35 or more per month, so remember to factor that in if you don't live centrally.  The busses are really good, though a little dear.  The tram will not be ready for another couple of years yet.  Having a bike is awesome though!

Edinburgh flats tend to be old with high ceilings and single glazing, and winter can get cold, so you could be in for a shock with energy costs. New builds in good locations are less common, and in 7 years in Edinburgh I never went for one because we found old places that we liked better.  The older places are spacious, light and beautiful!

I'd recommend living somewhere in the south side - Newington, Marchmont, Bruntsfield, Nicholson Street/Clerk Street, Toll Cross, that kind of area.  If you're within easy walk of George Square you'll have an easier time getting friends to come over and you're more likely to go out - I was in Morningside for three years and it was a great area, and not even that far out, but I definitely socialised less as a consequence.
