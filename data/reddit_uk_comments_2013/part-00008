One more option at CM - particularly one with such a strong existing record in the PL - would be valuable indeed.

Compared to the price tag for Benat, I'd bit off Madrid's arm for a deal like this. Might try a lower loan fee, but suppose it would still have to be quite robust for Madrid to accept.

It's custom artwork. Used for a tattoo. Doesn't matter if it's just a few lines in a general box shape or not. Tattoos are personal.

Tattoo art is very customized to you, and odds are it's going to require revision to make it exactly what you want. And then it's going to go to the tattoo artist who is going to say the same thing and revise a little more so it works on your skin. I would advise talking to a tattoo artist. They may not be Whovian, but if you show them a picture of the TARDIS and a general idea, they can probably get you what you want. They're artists after all, it's in the name. It's what they do. And as you know, tattoos (good ones) aren't cheap. They're well worth it in quality, despite me having none, you can tell when something's been done meticulously. A tattoo artist uses skin and ink as their mediums of choice, whereas most artists you will find on reddit will be exclusively sticking with paper or a computer screen-an entirely different beast.

Had you left out the tattoo bit, I'm sure you would have had some more people pouncing on it to draw it. I certainly would have. But any time I've drawn flash art, it's not cheap for me (I'm not a digital artist), and even then it's probably got to be retooled by the tattoo artist because of sizing issues with what part of your body you want it on, and your own skin and what they feel will look best as it ages and heals. Especially with you wanting something minimalistic, not that line art tattoos aren't popular by any means, but nuances that happen with hand drawn, or even digital art, aren't going to be entirely possible with a tattoo and you'll still need to talk with them anyway to get it just right for you. 

I didn't mean to turn this into a long post-just kind of happened. I'm sorry!

Like others have said in here, the Doctor being the last Time Lord is such a crucial part of not only his character (as shown in countless episodes by both Nine, Ten and Eleven) but also of the show and the universe itself. Many phenomena are explained by the extinction of the Time Lords, such as time being in flux, alternate dimensions, various rampaging monsters etc.

Go back and watch Colin Baker's Trial of a Time Lord arc. They're easily one of the worst parts of the show. They're boring, obstructive for the sake of being obstructive, aggravating, and as ancient and learned as they are, they're duller than a bag of pebbles. 

Plus, the ""last of his kind"" facet added to the New Series Doctors has been overwhelmingly crucial to their characterization, as mentioned elsewhere here. That's something he has to live with, and it undermines the past several seasons if it got magically undone. He'd be arguably happier (or freaked out of his damn mind, note ""The End of Time"") but then he'd rebel against them like he did when he was younger (or trying to outright destroy them AGAIN) which would throw his character arc back light years.

true,The-Darkest-Knight,num19,,"Good summary from OP, just adding a few points of my own:

* Mbia got away with a lot, he should have been on a yellow in the first 20 minutes and that would have killed his game off, he would have been sent off before the half even ended had he continued that way but the ref just let him be. Dembele is strong on the ball, but when someone the size of Yaya Toure or Mbia are going to ""physically barrage"" him, he won't be able to take it, he's not 6'6"" and 200lbs after all. I think after the first few times Dembele should have stayed clear of Mbia and not tried to take him on. He had a bad game, he's allowed one since he hasn't had a bad game EVER in a Spurs shirt.

* Ade was horrible. I like him a lot, but he was just terrible. He didn't GET on the ball, he waited for it to come to him, it kept getting pinched from him and he just didn't show the eagerness to prove himself like he did last year. 

* Another thing that stood out was the lack of crosses into the QPR box, apart from corners and free kicks, did we get any aerial balls into QPR's box for Ade to attack? Could someone get me a stat, I don't remember seeing any. Here's where I think Benny would have been great. Naughton is quick and he's good and all, but Benny would have been pretty good against a side like QPR, he is a little more creative and whips in some delicious crosses as well.

* I thought Lennon was below par as well, sadly. One of his less inspired performances, but then again he didn't get any space.

* Bale and Defoe tried, so for once I'm not going to get after Defoe. :P

* Apart from that, SuperJan and Dawson were absolutely stellar. I'll take the point, but I really hope we get 3 when United visit next week. COYS.",0,1358052103,null,0,false,0,c7vz1ax,t3_16g2ue,t1_c7vz1ax,t3_16g2ue,null,1430943654,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Why the word cis? Quite simple, which makes a nice change in etymology: cis [is a Latin word for on the same side of](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cis#Latin). Trans [is a Latin word for on the opposite side of](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trans#Latin). That is where the trans in ""transgender"" comes from, and the term cisgender too. As a term of art, [it is used with similar meanings in chemistry, for the make up of molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cis%E2%80%93trans_isomerism).

So trans and cis come from pretty neutral Latin roots, and are a pretty neutral shorthand for either being psychologically and physically the same gender, or having a mismatch between the two. Abbreviations of neutral, factual terms.

To see cis and trans as hate speech is ridiculous, of itself, unless people can show some extra venom behind the word (as with the word homo, somewhat, in English, but strangely not in French). I've not seen such venom with cis (and perhaps she has; I won't say she hasn't), but I have definitely seen venom behind usage of the word trans. But I'll add that I've not even seen _much_ insult behind the word trans; much more often, people make derivatives such as ""trannie"" to use with pejorative intent.

**tl;dr** Just because two words sound alike she's decided it's a term of abuse? That's idiocy.

Edit: another parallel came to mind; staircase wit and all that. Hetero and homo; of those, only homo ever really had any pejorative usage and even that seems (as far as I can tell) to be fading. But when homosexuals decide to insult heterosexuals, they usually invent a new insult, such as the word ""breeder"".

He's never been prolific for Spain and when partnered up he tended to fade and allow Villa to take the chances, he scored important goals now and then but the relative infrequency of International games, and the overall quality of Spain's midfielders meant once again, not a whole lot of pressure to win.
At Chelsea he was exposed to a whole new reality. Competition to perform. He simply wasn't up to it initially (due to injury) and that stumble was simply not tolerated - now the pressure has reached a critical point, fans (old and new) are for the first time not really cheering him on.

These rumours have been treated much like the rumours about Jimmy Savile before he was exposed. Everyone has kind of heard them but nobody thinks there is much too it. 

Then look what came out about Jimmy Savile. There are reports from over 450 alleged victims yet none of it came out while he was alive? And now we have reports from two of his alleged victims that he wore a hooded robe, and chanted 'hail satan' while others stood around as he raped and abused one in a candle-lit basement of a hospital he boarded in (unusually). Another was a prostitute at a sex party and reports a similar set-up. No, I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss it as silly. I had thought the Savile rumours as silly.

edit:I'm not saying that Jimmy Savile actually worshipped satan which enabled him to do the things he did but it's not impossible to imagine a group of high members of society using the vestiges of 'Satanism' as a device while they practised debauchery (see the hellfire club link above for example). The article reports two unrelated women with similar encounters with Savile. I don't know why I'm being downvoted for saying this. I suppose you would have downvoted me if I had said it's not impossible to believe Savile might be a paedo 1 year ago with as many as 450 notches on his bed post.

some details about the image:

1. this was quick photoshopping, so forgive the quality.
2. i think either the liverbird or crest ought to sit in the top left permanently. i love the liverbird, so i chose that. it should sit directly above the middle of ""you'll never walk alone""
3. the rotating photo should be moved to the sidebar. i put it over the top of the current picture (crest). however, it could be moved to the very top of the sidebar, above the pre-match-post links. personally, i think it works better where it is now.
4. i added a photo caption to the image, so that newer fans or other visitors know what the image is about.

finally, i'm a mod over at /r/lotr and i designed their subreddit theme. if you're a lord of the rings or tolkien fan, you should wander over and read some threads.

Sahin can be slow at times which is why I like playing Allen there instead (he's gone anyway). Gerrard still is an excellent CAM in FIFA at least, monster shots. Suarez makes phenomenal attacking runs on the right, and can dribble well, while Assaidi provides a lot of trickery down that left side. In fact really like Assaidi there, though if I change things up I'll usually swap him for Sterling or even Borini. Sturridge gives that extra punch at the striker role, and I feel that's where he fits best.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"That's right, in theory he is a free transfer for any club willing to take him. That is the reason why I didn't believe the Galatasaray rumor - they would be out of their minds to offer £12M for him.

Financially what we would be looking at is making him the top paid player at £140-150k per week, a 4 year contract, and a signon bonus of around £5-6M. IF you divide that out over the 4 years it works out to be a net of £9M per season

The Andy Carroll deal (yes, I know, I know) was a net of £11M p.a, our squad average is around £6M - £9M isn't super unreasonable.

In terms of transfer budget, I am concerned that we only have £3M left (£15M - £12M for Sturridge). On the wages front we cleared £25M last season. This season we added £130k per week (Sturridge, Assaidi, Borini and Allen) and cut around £240k (Carroll, Cole, Spearing, Sahin) - which is a net of £110k which is £5.7M

Add that to the £3M from the transfer budget and it gets you to £8.7M, which is about what we need for Sneijder. It would leave nothing for Ince, but we could then do that deal in the summer. That is not even mentioning how much we have trimmed the wage bill over 2 years ago. We are the only club in the top 6 where the wage bill has shrunk. New TV deal next year means we could easily grow the wage bill back up to old levels and still not extend revenue/wage % 

The types of deals that are squad restricting, such as moving Downing on and bringing Ince in, are more suited for the summer. The winter transfer window is much more suited for reinforcements, such as bringing in Sneijder (or somebody else, as in the case with Sturridge), to strengthen. Its why I am starting to think that this may actually make sense

As a side point, we have always had 4 players on top tier deals. At the moment we only have Gerrard, Johnson and Suarez on top-tier deals. There is room for one more.

Another point: I think Sneijder may accept less than what Inter were trying to cut him down to. His relationship with that club is dead, he won't play for them again. He now has to move to whoever is offering him the most or closest. He can regret not just taking the Inter pay cut, but it is too late for that now (he can also dwell on not accepting the United deal which would have made him a top 5 highest paid player in the world). He has also been out of the game for too long and needs to re-establish himself. Luckily he is young enough to do a 4 year deal and then in the midst of that go back and do a large pension plan deal that will take him into his 30s

If you've got skills, it's not as much of a problem, but in a recession the low paid jobs tend to disappear as the people who got made redundant take the remaining jobs.

I'd recommend London to anyone who moved to the UK as a young person. You've got everything at your doorstep. But, yes, the cost of housing there is extortionate. Most Australians tend to get a big house, slightly out of London, and they all share the expenses. Maybe look for an expat share household to move in to?

I've also done some talks at secondary schools that have more chemicals and equipment around called 'Life, the Universe, and Chemistry' which is usually about an hour and a half to two hours. Depending, and I bounce around through the history of the Universe throwing in all the science we know along the way.

&gt; He earns £80,000 a week. He should know better. He should set an example to kids. That’s what we expect of our footballers. The rewards they receive demand a level of behaviour.

&gt; That’s what many people would say and, on one level, I’ve no argument. When I was given my first contract, the youth team coach, Eric Harrison, told me: ‘You’re a Manchester United player now.’ The implication is that certain standards are expected. And as you grow older, you realise that you’re a United player for life — your attitudes and behaviour will always be scrutinised and questioned.

&gt; But what I will never accept is people making a direct link between the amount of money you earn and your behaviour, as though a new, £80,000-a-week contract will automatically bring a certain level of responsibility.

&gt; Your character isn’t formed by your bank balance. It is developed over 20 years of growing up through different experiences — some good, some bad — through parenting and upbringing. And a £4million-a-year contract won’t change that overnight.

&gt; And as I’ve watched the debate on Luis Suarez gather momentum, I detect a rush to judge a footballer, to castigate him without any thought to how different his life experiences are.

&gt; Though Suarez is 25, he has been in England for only two years. He’s still adjusting. This is a kid who grew up playing football on the streets in Uruguay, who has experiences and a background completely different from anyone reading this newspaper. Those are the years in which character is formed. Then you’re thrust into a global game with expectations of behaviour and certain rules and  regulations which maybe didn’t exist when you were learning your football.

&gt; In most professions, you build a career over time, making your mistakes in obscurity when you’re young before getting financial rewards. Who doesn’t know someone young who has been disciplined or sacked for misjudging a situation in an office? Usually it comes early in a career and most learn from it. In football it’s the other way round: the money and status comes when you’re young and the maturity comes afterwards.

&gt; That’s why I think there are such strong feelings about Suarez. Opposition fans despise him and he would be a nasty little player to go up against. I know that if I was up against him at Old Trafford today, there would be a confrontation. One of us would put in an over-the-top tackle or an elbow. At best, there would be a shouting match at some point because he’s the kind of player who takes the fight to you.
But I’ll tell you something else: he’s exactly the kind of player you would want in your team. And, as a fan, you would love to see him on your side.

&gt; Liverpool fans sing: ‘We all dream of a team of Carraghers.’ But now they could just as well chant about a team full of players like Suarez, a fighter who will chase down the ball, one of the most skilful players in the  Premier League, and a player who this season has had more touches in the opposition’s penalty area than anyone in the top flight.

&gt; I understand why some people will never like him. The racial abuse he directed at Patrice Evra is totally unacceptable in England, whatever he says about what passes for acceptable language in Uruguay. But he has served his punishment for a big mistake.

&gt; But the supposed cheating, the diving, the lack of sportsmanship? For me, it hardly merits the discussion time we give it. I haven’t got a problem with the handball against Mansfield other than that it was a poor decision that went against a non-League club and might have cost them a much-needed replay. But I’ve never heard the word cheat used so cheaply as in recent weeks by former players and pundits. Cheating, for me, is doping, cheating is match-fixing, despicable actions which undermine the whole essence of sport.

&gt; A handball or a foul on a player bearing down on goal is part of the game. It’s covered in the rules.  You take your penalty — be it a sending-off or a free-kick — and get on with the game. Everyone in sport knows that. It’s a harsh environment, where not everything turns out fairly, just as in everyday life. What happened against Mansfield was an injustice. But it wasn’t cheating.

&gt; When I look at Suarez I see one hell of a footballer, a player whose name you can be sure will be dominating United’s preparations. This is no show-pony. This is a player who doesn’t know when he’s beaten.  In that respect he’s better than Fernando Torres, who you feel  might get despondent when things aren’t going well. Not Suarez. He’d be in your face, scrapping every minute of the game, even if all hope was lost.

&gt; Liverpool are going through a difficult time and I’m sure their fans will feel he represents the club’s spirit on the pitch, almost in the way that Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard do. He might have learnt his football on the streets of Salto and Montevideo, but you could almost imagine him having grown up around Anfield, between those back-to-back terraced houses, such is his commitment to his team’s cause. And they will also know that Liverpool will have to add a few more players like him if he is to stay at the club for the long term.

&gt; Suarez has made mistakes and had moments he will regret. But then I’ve had a few of those, especially in this match, incidents for which I was fined and missed matches. It’s right that the authorities punish you when you do step out of line. And slowly you learn to temper your behaviour and mature. And, at 25, Suarez is reaching the point when he does need to make sure there are fewer and fewer controversial moments.

&gt; Today, he could do well to look at his direct opponent. Robin van Persie is the best striker in the country. Most people would regard him as a very good professional. Last year he was the overwhelming choice for both Professional Footballers’  Association Player of the Year and Footballer of the Year.

&gt; But when he was a 20-year-old at Feyenoord he had a controversial reputation. His coach, Bert van  Marwijk, called him ‘uncontrollable’. He had an on-pitch argument with the star player, Pierre van  Hooijdonk. Now Van Persie’s 29 and all that has changed.

&gt; It took time to develop into the model professional. But you are dealing with a human being with a unique set of experiences and motivations, not a robot. And if Suarez can do the same, he has the potential to be a great player.",0,1358070511,null,0,false,0,c7w2qap,t3_16heu1,t1_c7w2qap,t3_16heu1,null,1430945460,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

Then, we decided that we wanted to terminate Sahin's loan - he wasn't recalled by Madrid, we wished to end the loan. Madrid were OK with this only if another club would take Sahin up, and that other club turned out to be Dortmund.

But say Dortmund were only willing to pay 60k/pw of his wages; who pays the 20k/pw difference between his Dortmund &amp; Liverpool wages? 

Most likely, us; we're the ones who sought to terminate the loan, and Madrid could have made it a condition of transferring the loan to Dortmund that Liverpool pay any difference in wages so that Madrid continue to only contribute 40k/pw as they initially had.

I'm not saying this is definitely what happened; maybe we aren't subsidising his wages, either because Dortmund are paying the same amount as us, or because Madrid didn't make that condition I suggested above.

This time last year, my food budget was £40 per month. It remained that way for five months, mostly because I wanted to see if it was possible. It was, albeit with the need to think ahead and buy appropriately.

The aim this year was to do it again - only for the majority of the year. £40 - £50 per month, throw the rest into a savings account etc.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to start - I've had to delay it to February [something someone on welfare wouldn't have the luxury of, I'm well aware].

But in reference to the above quote?

* 1KG Bananas: .68.
* Ten Oranges - £1.00.
* 750G Spring Onions - £1.00.
* 750G Mixed Dried Fruit - £1.00

Those are just the ones I know off the top of my head, because I buy 'em on a regular basis. Healthy eating doesn't have to be expensive.

**Edit:** I should also point out a few things:

* Just because I can happily live on a food budget of £40 / £50 a month, doesn't mean everyone can. Different people have different calorific needs. I can happily live on 1L of soup for days at at time - cheap [averages out to 32 - 25p per Litre depending on the ingredients] and not that many calories.

Seeing as this comes up far too frequently, the following refutes your superficial view on the comparison of both Rory’s and Amy’s experiences as those who have waited.

It is not simply a case of 36 years v. 2000 years, in this respect, numbers actually mean very little. Firstly, Amy is left behind through no choice or fault of her own. In comparison, Rory chose to wait as a penance for killing Amy, he wanted to protect her, yes, but when you consider the Pandorica is meant to hold the Doctor, it’s probably pretty secure.

Amy is left in isolation for those 36 years with no human or alien contact, with daily battles to stay alive. She changed enormously during those years, how many times must she have had depressive moments in which she considers giving up and letting the handbots put her to sleep? But no, every day she fought to live – 13140 days of fighting.

In comparison, yes, Rory fought to protect the Pandorica. But it was not every day, he was not under constant threat for his life. He was able to protect the Pandorica simply by being there as a presence and even just persuading people to leave it alone. Furthermore, during his time he was able to socialise with other people, he travelled the world, he fought alongside historical figures, he had a *life* that did not revolve around just staying alive.

Rory knew what would happen at the end of his waiting – he’d already seen the Doctor in his fez, he knew Amy survived, heck, in a way he even knew he would survive. Amy however didn’t, she was stuck waiting for the Doctor who has already continually abandoned her (and abandonment as a child is a difficult thing to forget). She didn’t know what would happen and whether she would ever see Rory again. When Young Amy sees Future Amy, you can see the memories start to form, Time is rarely circular in the Whoniverse, and we cannot assume that Future Amy actually previously experienced that conversation.

Ageing: Amy aged. She grew old without the husband she loves and is suddenly confronted him in his young glory. The embarrassment, shame and anger she must be feeling towards the Doctor depriving them of the best years of her life. And she is angry at the Doctor – not Rory – because he hides away in his TARDIS and doesn’t face what has happened.

Rory however didn’t age. Yes, there was a threat of death and not healing, but the passage of time was never an issue. He knew he would be physically young when Amy awoke, and in a sense it didn’t matter because his goal was the future, it was to waste time.

The section of the Act it's amending is [here](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/section/47). It's not terribly easy to read, though.

The Government announced their intention to make this change a few months ago, and I remember discussing it at the time. The key thing to note is that this does not affect the criminal charges which employers are liable for if they breach H&amp;S regulation - these are the main teeth that the H&amp;S system has. It only affects the way civil damages are awarded.

The best explanation I've found is in the Government's [impact assessment](http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/12-1219-strict-liability-health-safety-at-work-impact) on the matter:

&gt; The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 is underpinned by the principle of ‘reasonable practicability’.  In some health and safety regulations, including those arising from EU law, the duty imposed is a strict one and no defence of having done what was ‘reasonably practicable’ is available.  In such cases this means an employer can be held liable to pay damages to an injured employee despite having taken all reasonable steps to protect them.

Based on this, and my experience with H&amp;S law, this seems pretty reasonable. I don't think UK H&amp;S law is overbearing, and one of the reasons behind that is the concept of reasonable practicability.

OK, I've digested the impact assessment a bit more and now I think I understand what's going on here.

What this amendment does is removes the ability for employees to sue their employers for damages under H&amp;S law. This sounds pretty drastic! But actually what happens is that the liability of employers falls back onto the common law [duty of care](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care).

In my (non-legal) opinion, duty of care is pretty good - it has a huge body of eminently sensible case law backing it up. Any court considering whether an employer has breached their duty of care will consider H&amp;S law as best practice.

I would encourage people to read the entirety of the [impact assessment](http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/12-1219-strict-liability-health-safety-at-work-impact) before they make their minds up on this.

Bullshit. Jumping through pointless hoops like ""back to work"" classes run by for-profit organisations helps nobody. Signing on and showing you've looked for work is a fair enough requirement, however.

While on benefits (for illness, in my case) you are treated pretty badly by the generally uncaring JobCentre staff. Even explicitly asking for help and telling them what you think you need results in nothing being done.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;To turn it the other way round, employers are currently liable for damages when an employee is injured even if there's nothing they could possibly have done to prevent it. I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask someone to prove there's been negligence.

Only if there was a ""reasonably practicable solution"" that wasn't being implemented. The whole point of the health and safety at work act is to protect employees. Making them provide additional evidence, on top of the fact that they have been harmed, is not in the best interests of the employee so it is unnecessary.

&gt;In terms of civil liability (i.e. compensation), this has never been something which the HSE adjudicates on. The courts will always decide matters of civil liability.

I've only skimmed the summary on the page for the poll but if it is true that the employee will have to provide proof of negligence, this is weakening the employee's position. At the moment, the fact that an accident has happened is often enough evidence, effectively.

true,pharao007,null,null,"Only one perspective in that article. Coming to UK I have learned many strange (for me) things. For example:

* many people don't bother making at home their second breakfast. Buying food at restaurant, cafe, sandwich shop or even prepared sandwiches in Tesco is far more expensive than preparing them at home. When people say they don't have time... sorry, how long does it take to make a sandwich?
* Regular weekly friends meeting and pub drinking. Spending money on drinks in a pub is really expensive. If you have spare time you can meet with a friend and even have a drink (for example at home, buying beer earlier in supermarket) but very often it looks like that if a person doesn't go to a pub at least once a week it is a real tragedy!

One more thing, they guy said he would only work for 18 hours. Come on, this is a part time job, so I presume he would eventually found a solid 40h per week!

true,Russss,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; Only if there was a ""reasonably practicable solution"" that wasn't being implemented. The whole point of the health and safety at work act is to protect employees. Making them provide additional evidence, on top of the fact that they have been harmed, is not in the best interests of the employee so it is unnecessary.

I'm not sure you quite understand the current ""strict liability"" part of the legislation. The problem is that ""reasonably practicable"" doesn't come into it. In some (although not all) cases the employer is liable for civil damages even if there *isn't* a reasonably practicable solution (i.e. if they've done everything right). An example from the Löfstedt report:

&gt; Mr Stark, a postman, was injured when the 
front brake of his bicycle, supplied by the Post Office, snapped and he 
was thrown over the handle bars.  It was found that the defect that 
caused the brake to snap could not have been detected.  The court was 
asked to consider whether the Post Office had breached its statutory 
duty under regulation 6 of the Provision and Use of Work Equipment 
Regulations 1992 that ‘every employer shall ensure that work equipment 
is maintained in an efficient state, in efficient working order and in good 
repair’.  The court found the duty had not been breached as the duty 
required a reasonable level of maintenance and the Post Office had 
done their best to maintain the bicycle and check for faults.
&gt;
&gt; However, the Court of Appeal overturned this decision and ruled, in light 
of UK case law, that where an employer ‘shall ensure’ the duty imposed 
is a strict one and since the brake snapped the employer was in breach 
and consequently liable to pay compensation.

It is of course weakening the employee's position slightly (and purely because of this, the government will be accused of being in the pockets of businesses), but I do not think it's unreasonable to ask an employee to prove that there was negligence before being awarded damages.",0,1358082948,null,0,false,0,c7w40ia,t3_16hjef,t1_c7w40ia,t1_c7w3xku,null,1430946116,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Paying out on a loan for a stove from an organisation that will advance credit to a person on low wages is beyond the budget (£4 a week is not a lot until you consider it is over 10% of your budget, and if you miss a payment!) and then you end up paying twice the cost of the stove. 

Apparently the housing trust used to have funds to underwrite a programme that rented out white goods but this was removed by the (labour) government as a cost saving measure.

&gt; It shall be the duty of every employer to ensure, **so far as is reasonably practicable**, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees.

The Stark v Post Office case wasn't under that general duty, but under the specific duty (then in the 1992 Regulations, now in the [1998 Regulations](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/2306/regulation/5/made)) to ""ensure that work equipment is maintained in an efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair."" Given that, using the Stark case to argue against removing the ability to bring a claim under the general duty is misleading.

So then you have to ask the question of whether or not employers *should* be liable for their employees' safety? The EU and previous UK governments seemed to think they should be for a couple of reasons; firstly we want to encourage employers to look after their employees, and secondly employers are required to have insurance - meaning that they are going to be able to pay.

The alternative to strict liability is that an employee is injured during the course of their employment, the insurance company then gets into a long court case to argue that the employer wasn't really at fault - which just wastes everyone's time (except the PI lawyers and their expert witnesses).

&gt; “The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

&gt; Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

&gt; But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

&gt; This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”

― Terry Pratchett, Terry Pratchett's Men at Arms 

Just like any other sections of society the people that live around me (and this is not the poorest area in the UK but it is well within the bottom 1/3) do, at times, make poor choices it just that the consequences for that lack of judgment is far more if you do not have resources to support yourself.  I help out at a local drop in centre to help people that are facing financial hardship and it has been very noticeable over the time I have been there that I am seeing more people that are employed asking for help.  

I do see people that made silly choices but they are the minority (and tend to be young kids that have come out of the care system). ",0,1358089334,null,0,false,0,c7w4wlb,t3_16hici,t1_c7w4wlb,t1_c7w4lq3,null,1430946544,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

It's all well and good just jumping on whatever the latest liberal fad to come around is in a desperate effort to prove who is the most ""tolerant"" but unlike most of you I have actually known and been friends with transgender people and while I have to accept that they may not represent the entire community I can tell you for a fact that they were extremely histrionic and over dramatic people. They no longer care about work or what they can contribute to society, everything becomes about them and their ""issues"".

They lash out at their families, friends and those closest to them because no one is ever supportive or understanding enough. Their transgenderism becomes their entire lives and if they don't get adequate validation for their increasingly attention seeking behavior you will be labeled under the category of people who ""don't try to understand"" them.

true,Russss,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; Given that, using the Stark case to argue against removing the ability to bring a claim under the general duty is misleading.

You're right; it does seem a bit like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. 

I'm not familiar enough with the law to know whether moving all these compensation claims from H&amp;S law to the duty of care will actually make much of a difference.

The impact assessment does give a decent explanation of why they decided to do it this way, but thinking about it a bit more, it does seem a fairly significant change.

&gt; So then you have to ask the question of whether or not employers should be liable for their employees' safety?

I think this is a strawman. The most significant part of H&amp;S legislation as far as employers are concerned is always going to be the criminal part, which is unchanged by this amendment.

I think the key question here is that if there's an essentially blameless fault, then who should pay? Now I'm not so sure.",0,1358090329,null,0,false,0,c7w52mo,t3_16hjef,t1_c7w52mo,t1_c7w4jcd,null,1430946589,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,willyleaks,null,null,"Reasonable force is subjective. It's also dependent on the ability of the victim to reason it. Amusingly, those with more ability to reason are able to legally use more force as a consequence. You might argue that it is not up to you to decide reasonable force, but you do have to present your argument to those who do have to decide so what you give them is important. Many people also over look the time constraint, your actions have to be reasonable within a few seconds window, not within the windows of hours and dozens of people attempting to reason the best course of action in a court or a discussion on reddit.

If someone tries to mug me I instantly go for the kill. For example, if there is a brick within arms reach I pick it up and hit them on the head as hard as possible with as much force as possible. Unlike in the movies, it actually is not possible to know exactly how much force you need to knock someone out versus killing them. You can easily reason that using anything less than maximum force might have put your life in danger as it might not have been enough. It would also be the first thing that comes to mind that would definitely work. There is no law that says you must hand over your wallet or run away. If you had an absolutely guaranteed escape route it might factor in but otherwise its not an option you are legally compelled to take, so long as the assailant is able to reasonably give chase. If the mugger dies that is self defence and you're fine, as long as you're not too stupid to be able to justify and reason your actions. If it turns out you only knocked the person out but you still kept hitting them with the brick that would be considered excessive force. Because the mugger is the aggressor, you have the right to use more force than the mugger to survive. The aggressor's rights to survive are instantly forfeit in a battle where his survival threatens yours (or threatens significant injury to you such as disease, brain damage, loss of limb, sight, etc). These things don't have to be explicitly threatened either. A mugger is a rogue unpredictable agent (like a dangerous animal), so you can justify your right to prevent him from even being able to put you in a situation of vulnerability where he might pose a threat to life and limb. For example, if someone tries to kidnap you, they are breaking the rules of society already to a significant degree and you then can't say they wont break other major rules (rape, murder, assault) so you may defend yourself then in the reasonable believe that otherwise allowing yourself to be subdued may result in serious harm to yourself.

There are murkier scenarios but in the case of mugging it is fairly clear cut. As soon as that mugger makes his threat, his life is in considerable danger and the law does not protect him from that. At best, if he kills you while you are attacking him in fear of his own life it might end up being mitigated from murder to man slaughter. A lot of people assume that reasonable force means equal force but this is not strictly true. You usually just have to look at each case one by one. If a mugger threatens you with his fists and you stab him, assuming you have a legal reason for possessing a knife that is often justifiable even though not an equal amount of force. In your situation, I would stab the mugger in the jugular. This would be perfectly acceptable. On the other hand if the mugger is a 10 year old unarmed child and you're a big strong adult, using a knife for defence at all other than to threaten and scare the child would be considered excessive. The defender is permitted to use disproportionate force, as long as it can reasonably be justified as necessary or reasonable in mitigating the risk to himself or imprecise due to the limited time in which to decide what action to take.",0,1358090393,null,0,1358093999,0,c7w532h,t3_16ggg0,t1_c7w532h,t1_c7vvfw9,null,1430946592,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That was what I was trying to express in the last part; the policy position previously has been that the employer should pay on the grounds that they have insurance and are likely to have more money anyway than the employee - particularly in the industries prone to serious accidents. The courts have reflected this by making claims under normal employer's liability/negligence slightly easier (particularly with cases involving asbestos and lung diseases).

I don't know how much of a difference switching all civil claims to common law negligence will make (I haven't read the impact assessment; this isn't an area of law I work on) but I imagine it could make claims a bit more costly and time-consuming as there will be extra steps to argue (i.e. that a duty of care exists, and what that standard of care is); it may make it harder for these claims to be brought (which, I imagine, is the point).",0,1358091848,null,0,false,0,c7w5d2s,t3_16hjef,t1_c7w5d2s,t1_c7w52mo,null,1430946700,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

1) Really liking Sturridge. He has that extra oomph we needed up front. Good awareness to pounce on de Gea's spill. More importantly I want to point attention to his tracking back, which was great, as well as a one on one situation he had with Ferdinand. That ability to make a little bit of space after picking up a pass on the edge of the box is fantastic and what we need. 

2) Our defense really started picking up their game. Aside from the slip for the set piece (there wasn't much we could do against van Persie's goal) they were solid as shit. Winning balls, circulating possession, staying alive under pressure. Great second half for Skagger. 

3) Good subs by BR. Lucas was on a yellow, and Allen had a poor first half but in the second he proceeded to definitely pick up his game. Hendo and Allen competing for that holding role which is good. And Gerrard did beautifully, playing deeper and coming up every now and then to nick the ball. 

4) Lucas needs to improve on his passing and distribution if he is to play that defensive role paired with Gerrard. He didn't do a good enough job circulating play and relieving pressure from the defense. 

5) Our players, particularly defense, were brave today. They constantly tried to play out from the back, even when being wackily pressured by United. We slipped up, have the ball away, but the strength of possession football is STICKING to it even when being pressed. At one point the commentator complained about our style, saying how he didn't understand why we didn't just boot it up. But really, he didn't understand the importance of playing out from back. 

6) Hope! We looked revitalized and dangerous in the second half. Our team kept possession well, defended well, and got in the box. Once we gel more, we will learn to create better chances and not resort to shooting from distance (and losing possession).

Allen is really...frustrating. Offers nothing defensively or offensively and has been doing so for a few months now.

Stevie G and Lucas didn't have a good games today but didn't do too badly either.

Sterling was awful. Looked clueless out there. Don't know why some people are hating on Downing, i thought he was the only player along with Suarez who actually took the game to United in the first half. His crosses didn't go anywhere but at least he looked dangerous and was able to send a few crosses in.

Suarez/Sturridge looked really good together. The only positive highlight of the game.

Borini and Hendo performed okay when they came on.


Overall, disappointed but not surprised. Going in the game, sterling and allen have been disappointing for a while and without suarez and gerrard to provide the magic, we looked out of ideas in the first half. Skrtel and Agger were at fault for both goals but they haven't been the most solid defenders.

In the second half after 2-0 manchester looked to defend their lead so our defence was a lot less vulnerable despite the substitution of lucas for sturridge. With sturridge supporting suarez, we looked immensely better going forward and looked even better when sterling came off for borini.

Overall, sterling and allen continue to disappoint. Until we have players who can perform consistently in every position, we're going to be stuck in mid-table for a while.

United gambled on being able to hold their high press and pounce on mistakes.  They capitalized and won the match because of it.  (I thought RVP would score again as well)

Wisdom and Sterling are extremely talents, but young.  Amateur mistakes can cost you huge in matches like today.  Downing had a great run of form up until today.  Allen has been well rested recently and should have been back on form.  Sturridge is new and might now gel perfectly, especially against a talented side as united.  Same goes for the long missing Borini.  Hendo I didn't quite understand.

Second half was great and exciting.  I was reminded why I love Gerrard so much, and I am excited about the upcoming run of matches.",0,1358092032,null,0,false,0,c7w5egt,t3_16hs5z,t1_c7w5egt,t3_16hs5z,null,1430946719,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Gotze is a monster and has been tearing up defenses single-handedly. There are theoretically better options than Lewandowski, but as long as he's pounding in more goals than games he's appeared in each season, I'm not replacing him. He was my first transfer.

Bench: 

Prus (Polish GK with ovr. 75 who I signed for 2.6 mil (euros) and is on 10k a week)

Jose Enrique

M'Bia

Sahin (was a starter until I signed Wilshere in the last window)

Casemiro (quick Brazilian DM, ovr. 85. I use him as a defender against teams with lots of pace, as Hummels only gets to 78 pace)

Cazorla (switches with Krasic based on opposition; Cazorla is more skilled, Krasic is infinetely faster and crosses better)

Leandro (fastest player I have other than Santon and Krasic, CF/ST/winger, ovr. 82)

There definitely still needs work with the Suarez - Sturridge partnership in terms of understanding each other positionally, but there were some good moments between the two. 

MOTM - Sturridge. I know it's kind of an easy pick since he's the goal scorer, but the game changed when he was introduced. Our attacks were suddenly for fluid, we started getting shots on goal, and eventually, we got that goal. 9/10

Suarez - First half we were trying to force him the ball, which lead to nothing. Second half was a little better, held onto possesion a couple times in the final third that lead to some chances. Good performance. 8/10 

Sterling - I hate to be tough on him, and I try to keep in mind that he's an 18 year old playing against Man U today, but he wasn't good enough. Ran at defenders who were as quick as him, which just lead to a reversal in possession. 6/10

Downing - Not great, not terrible. Definitely seeing improvements in his confidence over last season. He looks like a different player. 7/10

Gerrard - Good game. Controlled the midfield in the second half. Got the shot on goal that lead to Sturridge putting it behind. 8/10.

Allen - Terrible. I'm sorry, but he contributed nothing. He was too bold in his challenges, he wasn't keeping possession, his forward passes weren't going to anyone. He's looking like a different player than the one that walked into Anfield at the beginning of the season. I really hope he can find his form, we need him. 4/10

Lucas - I honestly didn't notice Lucas much. 

Johnson - Not his best. Bad marking on the second goal, a couple bad challenges, some that didn't get called. Decent going forward. 5/10

Skagger - First goal could have been defended better. Apart from that  saw a good game from the two. 7/10

Wisdom - Considering he's a 19 year old playing against Man U he played very well. I saw a couple moments of hesitation but other than that good job defensively. Also, he took that flying headbutt like a champ. 8/10

Reina - Made some good saves. Both goals *could* have been played a little better, but I wouldn't fault him for either. 8/10.

Borini - Looked pretty good. He was playing in an awkward position (LM? I'm still confused about that formation), but he connected well on a volley and linked up well with Suarez and Sturridge. 8/10.

Henderson - Didn't really play long enough to get rated IMO.

If you have never had a look at it the Black report (1980, www.sochealth.co.uk/public-health-and-wellbeing/poverty-and-inequality/the-black-report-1980/) is a good read. 

But then have a look at 'Fair Society Healthy Lives' (The Marmot Review, www.instituteofhealthequity.org/projects/fair-society-healthy-lives-the-marmot-review). 

Then think how much in common they have, very little changed in 30 years. 

As for depression, mental health is the area I have had a lot to do with. Of all disabilities mental health has the highest rate of unemployment and many people with mental health problems are underemployed (short hours, underpaid, working in roles they are overqualified for). 

Those that work in low paid positions that they have little control over (or are unemployed) have a heightened risk developing mental health problems.  

And the most common mental health problem is anxiety and depression. 

[If you really want them I’m happy to quote the references for the above statements]. 


I’m looking into environment and mental health as my next project so I am just doing a literature search right now but have found a few interesting studies that do suggest a link between accessible green spaces and depression within the UK.  

Edit: As for your Mother, I hope she is doing better now but have a look at ""Learned helplessness"" by Seligman and Maier. 

(Sorry, from Wikipedia)


&gt; Experiment - Summary

&gt; In the learned helplessness experiment an animal is repeatedly hurt by an adverse stimulus which it cannot escape.

&gt; Eventually the animal will stop trying to avoid the pain and behave as if it is utterly helpless to change the situation.

&gt; Finally, when opportunities to escape are presented, this learned helplessness prevents any action. The only coping mechanism the animal uses is to be stoical and put up with the discomfort, not expending energy getting worked up about the adverse stimulus.

So this is another way to look at your mother and anyone else that faces such issues, it can get to the point that you just give up.  ",0,1358092374,null,0,1358092688,0,c7w5gxm,t3_16hici,t1_c7w5gxm,t1_c7w57pt,null,1430946752,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Suarez, Borini and Sturridge. This should be our front three for like the next 4 years or something. The stuff they pulled was brilliant, I love how after the first time Suarez and Sturridge linked up, Sturridge made a pass a little too far out for Suarez to compeltely control it, but as Suarez collected the ball to give it back to De Gea he was grinning to Sturridge. As opposed to the frustrated glances he gave to Wisdom, Gerrard, or whoever in the first half.

Borini needs to be a bit more vocal and get some sort of connection going with Suarez or Sturridge, but at the moment he's doing just fine as a distraction. The thing about Borini at the moment is that nobody could have done what he did today, not Shelvey, not Sterling, not Downing. Borini has that striker instinct to be able to dangerously finish so that defenders can't neglect him, but he also has that presence of mind to pull defenders away with his movement.

Sturridge pulled a little bit of what clever strikers do to get his goal, which was nice. He sort of looked dangerous by floating into the centre (danger area), then continued floating out of the danger area, before darting in unnoticed to grab a goal. It was what Van Persie kept doing to us in the first half. I was skeptical of Sturridge but I think I'm starting to love him more and more.

About our midfield, I think Allen can perform at times and yet just seems to disappear (in a bad way) completely at times. Henderson is a lot more solid and he should be starting. I think our formation was something like 4-2-1-3, with Gerrard playing alongside Henderson, it seems. Downing looked like he was supposed to be playing midfield, but he kept drifting to the right (?) Not sure about that.

But I think I've got my ideal lineup down for next season

-------------------Reina----

-Johnson-Skrtel-Agger-Enrique--

---------Gerrard------Henderson/Lucas/Allen-- (Lucas and Allen could also both replace Gerrard he ever needs a rest)

---------------New No.10--------

---Borini-------Suarez-------Sturridge (Or however they should play, it seemed like they all were crowding around together in the middle-left, with Downing covering the right)

So basically it looks like the missing piece here is just that advanced playmaker that we so desperately need. Grow up, Suso!

I couldn't possibly write here all the reasons I think it would be better (pop over to r/Scotland if it's something you might wish to take an interest in) however I'll sum up some of the reasons. 
For starters, I think we are poorly represent at Westminster. I usually get slated for saying this but the way I see it, Scotland as a whole didn't vote tory in the elections, yet we are subject to all of their outrageous attacks on the poorest people in the country. Scotland does not have the power to raise it's own taxes. We're a wee windy country that has the potential to become the centre of Europe for wind and wave energy, with the possibility in future of becoming completely self sufficient and exporting 100% of our oil reserves (which yes i agree wont last forever but the money could be wisely invested similiar to what Norway have done), I also heard (I will try to find a source) that in November they found 86 oil fields with an estimated value of 1.5 trillion. We wouldn't have to have Trident on our shores, which the vast majority of the Scottish population hate by the way, hand in hand with that is the rediculous amounts of money being spent on defence budgets. We're a cultural capital of the world, Edinburgh voted the most desirable place to visit, the tourist industry does well. 
Also, and perhaps most importantly we'd get away from the stinking ""strivers vs skivers"" crap thats all we ever get from the media. 
Jeez that was a bit of a jumble.

As it stands, Scotland flies St Andrews Cross, Wales flies the Red Dragon and England flies St Georges cross

However a quick Google search shows the national flag of Northern Ireland to be the Union Jack, this flag represents all countries in the UK and as such, i personally, feel it should only be used in situations where the interest of all four countries is address. 

As the other three countries all have their own flag so too should Northern Ireland. We need a symbol that we can ALL be proud off and i feel that a Northern Ireland flag would go a long way to solidifying a national identity in Northern Ireland. 

A possible nominee could be [St Patricks Cross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Cross). The name of it would hopefully appeal to Nationalists, and it is what is used to represent Ireland in the Union Jack ([Union Jack Specification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Jack#Specification)) which should also appeal to Unionist supporters.

Henderson has his positives in that role, his pressing and ability to keep to possession, but for me, he lacks the ability to truly be the link between the front 3 and midfield. Suarez is able to find that space in between their D and midfield, and actually open his body up to turn and run at the space there.

true,the_weeknd,null,null,"When will we learn to be consistent, when will we understand that it's a game of two halves.

Sterling looked like a boy against men, he is far to weak and in-experienced to start a game of this magnitude. He seems to run out of ideas when running at a player and consistently loses possession. The one thing he can be good for is holding the ball up but all the scum had to do was double up on him and he would either lose the ball once more or pass it backwards. Definitely not ready for a continued run in the first team, needs some time out and perhaps some sub appearances to give him time to adapt and learn with less pressure to perform consistently, after all he still is a young lad.

Suarez was as expected, isolated and I'm quite unsure as to why that wasn't anticipated by BR. The fact we had two defensive minded midfielders in Allen and Lucas also didn't help us going forward in the first half which lead to the scum doing as they pleased pretty much. Downing couldn't get forward because he had to help Wisdom out and Sterling as I previously mentioned offered nothing so I am not surprised we had a total of 1 shots in the FH. I would love to have known if the risk was worth taking in starting Sturridge because his introduction changed the game, the scum didn't know how to handle us because they only expected Suarez to play in the central role.

Allen's form has clearly drastically transformed since the beginning of the season, I haven't seen any stats today but he didn't win many challenges and his touches were poor, tried to get forward in fairness but didn't offer much to the team once more. Would have liked to have seen Shelvey start as Henderson didn't really impress when he came on but perhaps that's harsh with very little time left to influence the game when he was introduced. 

Other than that there were a few positives, Gerrard is constantly showing his desire and passion which is always a privilege and encourages me to believe he's got quite a few more years in the tank. Strurridge is now 2 goals in 2 games and although we conceded two goals we actually could have taken something from them in the end. Our second half performance was a lot better and that's definitely something to build on. Borini looked good to say it was his first game in months and we have Norwich at home next week and Suarez loves scoring against those inbreds so lets have it!

true,RobertTheSpruce,null,null,"My story seems relevant. It may be not, but I am bored and feel like typing, so I'm going for it.

I left school at 16. It was shit. I hated every moment of it. From the rejections of females to the bullying from the fucking asshole male classmates. I didn't care if most of them lived or died. Some of them though, I defiantly wanted dead

I didn't know what I wanted to do. School did not teach you about jobs. They taught us how to pass exams, a skill that would become useful later in life, but on leaving school? It seemed irrelevant to me. I knew nothing about the world outside, first aid, application forms, what the government do, how to vote, how to get a job. None of these things were taught, or even hinted at, at school. Naturally, my parents would answer many as best they could.

I decided I needed to know more. My school did not have a computer class to speak of. Up until year 10 we were using Acorn Electrons. I'm not too old, this was in 1998. 

I went to a local college at 16, studying computers. I was behind at the start, thanks to school not using windows PCs. Again people were dicks. My class consisted of 30 guys and 3 girls. 3. All the guys were fucking cunts. The 2 years passed slowly. The bullying persists. At this point I assume because so many people decided to be dicks to me, it must have been my fault. Surely everyone cannot have come to the same conclusion, without me giving them good reason. Again largely ignored by the females. I did have a very romantic chat to one of the ladies during class. She said she really liked me. I was amazed. The next day I found she had forwarded the chat log to the entire class. Thanks a fucking bunch.

I left college. Again, should the people there live or die? I don't care. My experience at school taught me one thing, people are cunts. Also how to use computers to a good standard.

I took this knowledge as a sign that my destiny lay in computing. I proptly applies for every single job using computers going. After many rejections (at no point had anyone ever told me how to *do* a job interview) I managed to get a job on the internet side of BT. A telephone tech support. People wouldphone me and tell me how shit my service was. I'm pretty sure looking back, they meant the service from BT Openworld, but after a while it hurts.  The first week was Hell. I was only verbally insulted by one work colleague to my face. The rest simply did not speak. I steyed for one week and never showed up on Monday. Still got payed though. That was quite impressive.

Then came the job centre. I needed to pay board and search for jobs, so JSA was what I got. £42 per week for doing nothing. Nothing! This was amazing. I liked it. Every week, I would go into the centre, look for jobs. They would ask ""How many jobs have you applied for this week Robert?"" I said a number between 3 and 10, and they were happy. It was glorious. Every 2 weeks the £84 cheque would arrive and  would go to the post office to get my hard earned cash, then head to Woolworths to buy as many video games as I dare, and give the leftover money to my mum (by this time it was just my mum, as dad had fucked off years before) for board.

This lasted for a year, possibly more until the job centre decided to wise up. I can't blame them. In fact when I come to think of it, the guy the job centre sent me to probably had more impact on my life than any teacher or other educator ever did. All of my time in school was eclipsed by a 20 minute chat to a guy called Jonathan who LOVED his job.

Jonathans job was to find people jobs, and fuck was he good at it. He was a nice guy too. He told me about a blind guy who would visit him regularly looking for work. The job centre would pay for his taxi fair to job interviews because he was blind. The blind man had a deal with the taxi driver, where the driver would write an expensive receipt for the blind man every single day, no matter if they went or not. It was a good scam. Jonathan simply let them get on with it. Immoral, sure.  But god already screwed the blind guy, he doesn't need the government screwing him too, right? Thats how Janathan worded it. I did't argue.

Jonathan asked me what I want to do. A question that in my 19 years, I had never been asked by anyone but mum. ""Well, I have XYZ qualifications."" I would reply. He looked at me, with a look of annoyance on his face. ""I said, what do you *WANT* to do?"" the real answer was nothing. I wanted to sit in my bedroom playing on video games and masturbating, hiding from the world, which I has long ago decided was shit. The game I had been playing a lot of lately is Championship Manager, so I had to think fast, he wanted an answer, and I had to find one, that he couldn't possibly achieve.

""A football manager"" I said. ""I want to coach and manage football a football  team. It has been my dream.""

""I know a guy."" Said Jonathan, more enthusiastically than I had ever heard anything said outside of an American sitcom. 5 minutes later I had a job interview a week from now in Derby, which was some distance from where I lived. An interview at Pride Park Stadium, home of my favourite team, Derby County. Before that Jonathan sent me on a first aid course and a health and safety certificate, done in the week before. He was fucking good.

Alas, the interview was not with the club, they were merely renting a room for interviews. It was a job centre sponsored position, the job centre would pay them to have me working there. Cheap labour for them I suppose. Long story about these guys short, they were a charity that put on sporting activities for kids in the deprived areas of Derby, which was most of it. The majority of which were little cunts. They put me through coaching qualifications, football, basketball, badminton, rugby, tennis, more and more, and it was immense fun. I managed to get to be the coach of an autistic football team.

You would think the transition to basement dweller to coach was a struggle, but it wasn't not really. Talking to children was easy. You simply asked them stuff and they would answer honestly, rather than the subterfuge and bullshit I was used to from actual adults. While I enjoyed the work out and about, life in the office was always a struggle. I was at this point a 20-21 year old virgin, who didn't really know how to speak to women, and disliked most men. It was at this point i turned to the internet for love.

I would use the internet a lot, sometimes staying in the office until late. I would use chat websites and meet women. Eventually one wanted to meet for a sexual encounter. It was unbelievable.

We arranged to meet in a public place. We did, and hit if off. She wanted to head to a secluded area and ""get some"" as she put it. We got there and it got heavy. My first kiss. I didn't tell her. 

She had a confession though that she wanted to tell me before. ""I lied to you about my age, I am 14. It's okay though, I'm still well up for this! I've done it loads, but don't worry, I don't have anything hehe!""

and with that, the erection was gone. Bail. Bail. BAIL. I made my excuses and left. Later, in some weaker moments in life, I would regret this decision. Then I regain my senses.

This had a deep effect on me for a time. It made me hate women. This became apparent office. I was soon sacked.

Another jobless time followed. Soul searching if you like. I continued internet love and eventually found a woman, who was not a sex crazed child, who actually seemed to like me. 4 years older than me, but that was cool. I was a big Final Fantasy 7 head in school and the line where clouds mum tells cloud to find an older woman, actually felt like she was talking to me.

She taught me about life, gave me confidence and everything. So much so, that I walked into a fire station, asked for a job, and fuck me, I got a job, and have had it for nearly 7 years. There are still office cunts, but there always are.

If you are reading, thank you Kerry. And fuck you everyone at school, teachers and all. Also, Jonathan, a job centre guy who worked in the Derby area, you were cool too.

TL;DR I was a 22 year old virgin, who hated everyone. Now I'm not, and only hate a shitload of people from my past, and I can conclude that Schools when I was there were a hell of a lot shitter than current ones.",0,1358093967,null,0,1358095553,0,c7w5tdn,t3_16gqn0,t1_c7w5tdn,t3_16gqn0,null,1430946912,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Another great game for Sturridge, very happy for him, hope he can start sooner rather than later.

Skagger didn't have a great game, and Wisdom, while he was getting forward a lot, didn't do incredibly well once he got forward.

Suarez &amp; Gerrard were invisible in the 1st half, 2nd half both became a lot more lively. Unlucky for Suarez he didn't score the header close to the end.

Allen was quite frankly rubbish today. Henderson or Shelvey would've been a far better pick.

Lucas, I'm surprised he was taken off, but it clearly worked to an extent. He normally allows Gerrard to push up, but they were both sitting too deep. I guess Rodgers knew what he was doing there anyway.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Tooth and Claw - Exceptionally well written, special effects are strikingly good for season 2. Has a lot of that constant ""unfolding"" that makes a very good Who episode. Plus some nice Rose/Doctor antics interspersed, for those that like Rose.

The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit - For some reason, this one just gets me every time. The scene when the Doctor falls into the pit freaks the hell out of me, even after watching it dozens of times. Once again it has that ""unfolding"" of more and more details, that are never truly put together until the very end. I really think season two was Davies' best season. Plus the ood are fucking scary in this.

A Good Man Goes to War - Because of my persistent fanboyism/man-boner/unrepenting love for David Tennant, he will always be my favorite Doctor, but this is an episode where both Smith and Moffat shine. Smith's dialogue is written very well for him. It's also filled with believable plot twists and ""how did I not see that?"" moments. I really enjoy watching this one over and over again.

The Girl in the Fireplace - I probably don't even need to explain this one. I know it would destroy the continuity of it all, but I still want some kind of special where Madame du Pompadour and 10 go on an adventure into space before she dies. Once again, I love season 2.

Human Nature and Family of Blood - This episode scared the hell out of me. For the first 30 minutes I was pretty convinced that everything the Doctor had ever done was a dream. Plus the emotional trauma of John  Smith realizing that he was just a guest in the body of the Doctor is a really interesting idea.

true,nutmegged,null,null,"BR went 4-3-3, Wisdom RB, Johnson LB. Lucas and Gerrard behind Allen. Sterling on the left.

MUFC had Wellback and RVP in front of Kagawa. Carrick marshalling in front of the back 4.

LFC struggled with possession due to constant pressuring from RVP and Wellback. Against Stoke, this was a weak point and similarly here, MUFC exploited that well. Result was LFC having limited time on the ball. DF and GK at times forced to hoof ball up. Alarm bells ring whenever Reina makes more clearances than short passes.

Carrick controlled ball distribution from deep, allowing their FBs to bomb forward. LFC's lack of pressure allowed MFC to dictate the game. Midfield trio contracted when MUFC had possession, with WFs forced to either close down or track advancing FB. Indecision allowed MUFC time and space to play.

RVP's goal was made by Evra's run. Closed down too late and good movement by RVP and excellent one-touch finishing. Good team goal, even better finishing.

LFC fortunate to be only 1-0 down after 45. First half characterised by lack of pressure by midfield, poor passing by midfield, Allen poor in ball distribution, Suarez isolated due to lack of cohesion with WFs, Sterling in particular struggling to make an impact, MUFC successful in pressuring DF and GK, Kagawa playing in space between LFC CB and MF an extra player at times.

Second half, Sturridge at CF in front of Suarez. Unfortunately, MUFC scored first. Reina looked unsettled trying to organise wall prior to free kick. Poor marking from Johnson allowed free header. Poor goal conceded.

LFC score 4 minutes later. In build up to goal, there was lack of usual pressure from MUFC FW. Good shot by Gerrard, good awareness by Sturridge and cool finish.

At 2-1, MUFC no longer pressed back 4, either due to fatigue or change in formation. Allen playing much better now playing deeper. Suarez combining well with Sturridge. More movement, more possession, more threat in attack.

Kagawa's sub saw MUFC opt to defend the last 20 minutes. Less pressure up front, MUFC prepared to defend lead. Resulted in LFC having more possession late in game, had chances to score but failed.

Johnson had dissapointing game, not as good on the left, and fortunate to not see red.

Yeah, that's fairly central.

When I was in London, I lived in Mornington Crescent, which is in South Camden, about a 45min walk from Trafalgar Square, and not far from Euston, St Pancras, Kings Cross, and Paddington stations.   

Many Australians live in Earls Court. But I'm not sure if they do any more because of the rent these days.

Maybe these will help:

true,Raffles_Dad,null,null,"First I agree that I do not want to know any personal information, I’m just a guy on the internet. 

However I have worked getting people into work that have long term mental health problems.  Can I suggest the following (this is advice I give out constantly, hence the “you” not “her” and I’m too lazy to change it right now). 

Try and get into some role, volunteering at a local charity shop is always a good one.  Holes in a CV are an issue with people with mental health problems and even three hours a week will demonstrate that you are doing something.  This will also keep you in contact with other people and allow her to retain social skills. 

Read the Equality Act and know where you stand with it, www.mind.org.uk/mental_health_a-z/8069_disability_discrimination,  when looking for a role read the  Pre-employment health questions section and know it off by heart. This is a common issue that your application form will come with a health questionnaire, this is illegal and you should never fill one in before you have been offered a role, by which time people will have invested time and money in you and will see you as a human not a liability. 

A reputable organisation will not send out a health questionnaire until after you have a job offer. You will probably be contacted at that point by a health professional in order for them to make an assessment. 

Although I will never advise a person to lie do not volunteer information.  And only discuss your health with those that need to know, and this may not be your line manager.  It is certainly not your co-workers, discrimination against mental health is a very real thing within our society, be very careful who you share your information with. 

Be realistic, Einstein stated that madness was doing the same thing again and again and expecting  a different result, if you have a problem within a role do not go back into an identical one. Look at reasonable adjustments or a possible change in direction, BUT the first thought should be that you need to look after yourself first. 

Educate yourself about yourself, get a good book, look at websites such as Mind and Rethink and do not be afraid of asking for help, many people with mental health problems within the UK do not seek help, mental health services are underfunded but if your mental health issue is adversely affecting your life then ask for help, you would if was a broken leg! 

Expect rejection, plan for it but don’t not do something as you consider you may be rejected, this time may be different. 

As with anything on the internet please look into these issues yourself and do not take this at face value.

I think a front three of Borini, Sturridge, and Suarez would be extremely effective. The biggest issue is our midfield at the moment. With Allen Gerrard and Lucas it feels like we have absolutely no service to the attacking players. It just feels so stagnant. The team we finished the match with looked so much more effective. I really wish we could have utilized Sahin more in a Lucas, Sahin, Gerrard midfield with gerrard pushed farther forward. I think that would have been extremely effective.

In addition, you'll need to take SAT IIs (over 700 in relevant subjects the minimum requirement) or APs (three 5s minimum - but you'll probably want to have at least five).

Dinners always included some mix of '3 for £10' tesco meats which would usually last me a week as one of these meats was mince which did 3 nights and the other usually 2 chicken fillets and 2 steaks.

Internet was something like £7 each and TV license must have been around £4 a month so that's a total of approx £391. I must say that at no point did I feel like I was living rough or cutting it fine.

I now live with my GF, the two of us cover all living expenses easily at £800 a month. Our rent is £425 a month and she insists on having heating at about £80 a month.

Johnson: 2nd goal was completely his fault. Otherwise, showed fantastic vigor and desire to play, great job on the left side defending and did an alright job going forward.  

Skrtel: He was determined to not let anyone get through, covered well, pushed forward well, passed fantastically. Good game, not perfect though  8/10. 

Agger: little better coverage on RVP and the first goal would have been nothing. Otherwise a solid defensive game. Good passes out of the back, great block on Welbeck, always plays as hard as possible.

Wisdom: People forget how young he is for how quickly he matured this season. Man he looked fantastic, save for not being too tight on Evra for 10 seconds.  Good going forward but I was hoping he'd finish that chance Suarez gifted for him, good vision up the touch line, took Vidic's fivehead to the side of the noggin and kept on going. Shows a lot of heart 8/10.

Lucas: Poor game. didnt provide a lot of help for the backs, looked slow, passes were alright but he didnt cycle it around the middle as much as I would have expected from him. Sub-par by his standards 4/10.

Allen: Where do I start... This guy is such an enigma sometimes.  Some games he dictates everything, making strong tackles and cycling the ball well but did absolutely none of that this first half. Got completely bossed around by Carrick and Cleverly, touch was shit, tackles shit, passes pretty poor. I don't think he should have been playing today, hes too small against such large/strong players..Second half he was a whole different player, but he didnt change the game enough. 

Gerrard: God I love this man. Pinged balls around the pitch, had one bad pass but set up the goal with an amazing shot. Should had have a better 1-2 with Suarez but it happens. Worked tirelessly, made some fantastic tackles, without a doubt my MOTM. 8.5/10

Downing: Ehh, average game. Had a couple nice runs and movement was good but why does he try to just beat everyone with pace? Does he have any moves? All he does is pass back unless he has a perfect lane, overall he's just frustrating. 5-6/10

Sterling: Shouldnt have been playing. Would rather have seen him come on in the second half as a burst of fresh legs to help attack a weaker Evra but BR did what he wanted.  Too weak, didnt take on defenders, passes were astray. Not his day 4/10

Suarez: Pretty quiet in the first half, did give Wisdom a perfect ball. Wanted to see him torch Evra but whatever, wish I saw more of him. Second half wasnt too bad, linked up with Sturrini a lot which was really hopeful to see.
7/10

Subs:
Borini: Finally. Fucking finally. God he's gonna be great once he gets time. Volley was close, movement was nice to see, I just want to see him start to blossom into the player I know he can become. 8/10

Sturridge: A striker that we need. Pace, power, and the want to get into that box no matter what. Thought he should have started but whatever.  I'd like to see him maybe shoot a wee bit less, pick up his head and try to look for Suarez or others making runs. Seemed to crush it into the side of the net a little too much. 8/10

Hendo: Why does he not start. Strong, imposing, made us look like a different team at the end with his ability to cycle the ball and his off the ball movement. And man, he seems to have a heart the size of Kuyt's with all his running. Wish he played more so I could give him more than a 7.5/10

Your choice. You decided to learn a language not spoken by the majority of Welsh people - and incidentally, suggesting to Welsh people that they're not speaking their native language is a tad insulting, don't you think, especially when that's *more than speak Welsh by a large margin*.

Carrico did show some promise and had a bit of good possession and work to switch the field. Has to do better in defensive positioning. I've thought Gunter has done really well since coming back into the starting 11 since Man City. Still not the best 1 on 1 defender but brings the level of attack up a significant amount by opening up the switch of play. The overlap and header to Kebe to win the penalty was a brilliant move on his part. I don't think we have another player smart enough to make that run. IMO still much better than Cummings both in attack and in the back. Still has the occaisional giveaway and mistake but has come a long way.

I was on a course last week, it was health and safety etc, you get a qualification from it, the class was interesting:

2 women, myself and another. The rest were men, about 10-15 of them. One of them could barely read and write, 3 of them spent the entire time talking down to me, treating me like I'm just a sex object ( which I hated, such as touching, calling me a girl, commenting on my figure, talking about blow jobs, sex toys. Etc ).

Several of them were ex military, I would say about 8 of them, there were 4 who were ""young"". The rest were 40+, the young people who were older than myself (I'm 22) were nice, decent people ( they weren't the pervs! ). They all had several interests and everyone in that room wanted to work.

The course gave us a level 2, which is amazing, as I assume a few have no qualifications.

The country is in a state, very little work and very little positive impact. I'm going into volunteering, helping old people, working at a shop and cafe,  and working as an admin, hopefully to get lots of experience, but its a shitty climate in an old industrial town.

The country will get there, but I think there needs to be less negativity towards people who have no jobs, it isn't a choice.

http://speedtest.net/result/2428965170.png

Average ping time on o2 was around 35ms, on infinity it tends to range between 10-20 depending on the server.

I didn't get on with the BT homehub but if you don't want to use any of the more advanced features you may be ok. The 3 main stumbling blocks for me were:


1 - You can't change the DNS servers. This is a ""security"" feature apparently.

2 - No remote management. Also a ""security"" feature.

3 - There's a bug which BT have been aware of for atleast a year which causes port forwarding to work only when it feels like it. Only really an issue if you want to host a server of some kind.

I tried calling BT support once. They were worse than useless. However complaining on twitter got me a call back within a couple of hours from a nice Irish lady and some credit applied to my account.

Also if you don't paying a £50 ""activation charge"" you can get a ""free"" youview box worth about £250. Which is nice.

Just because less people speak it doesn't mean Welsh isn't important. Also in my opinion it's a disadvantage not to speak Welsh in Wales today, not least for employment reasons.


*""You're scared of choice because you know what the result would be.""*

Not really. I don't personally care whether English-speaking teenagers do a Welsh 2nd language GCSE or whatever. Languages are taught so badly in the UK they hardly learn anything anyway. But it is in the students' interests to learn a bit of Welsh, for increased cultural awareness and better job prospects. Incidentally I think it would be ideal if all children were taught Welsh by immersion at school from birth, but that's unrealistic and unfair I suppose.

If you feel that it's your own ability that's holding you back, try getting involved with societies at university such as debating, or even just participating more in tutorial sessions during your studies. 

I remember when I was in the summer between my first and second years, and I attended an assessment center for an internship at a law firm. I had a very similar experience to you, in that I felt that I didn't have anything to contribute to the group discussion. I ended up being far too quiet and was unsurprisingly unsuccessful.

Er, yeah but that's not my point. The fact he felt like asking at all is a sign of the hysteria whipped up. And it's wrong to say it's solely by the media. The passive aggressive/political chip on shoulder legions have done a fair bit of bigging things up themselves.

I disagree. The isolated, recreational violence was predictable as was the media's hyperbolic coverage of 'NI in flames'. They could just say this is all about a few UVF personalities but then it's hyping the fuck out of things, being seen to be 'on the ground' (tm) and reporting things like a warzone that wins these idiots awards.

&gt;Before all this nonsense the sub was quite slow but now it's gotten a lot more active.

I think that only highlights the fact it's been hijacked by politicised sheep just here for the circlejerk.

&gt;And there's always some who like a bit of joking around rather than serious news all the time.

The 'jokes' are largely unoriginal and shit. Post them in /r/funny and see how they get on (after all, according to one BBC rep on here it's a 'worldwide newstory' so everyone must know the backstory). It's just another way of obsessing over one topic. Other reddits ban macros for that very reason - because the vast majority are shit. But on here the 'right sort' receives unthinking upvotes.

And you don't think the Alliance are capable of similar politicking with this agenda of theirs? An agenda they aren't pushing in any other council? An agenda that went against professional equality advice?

Political leaflets is as old as the hills. If that were really such a large effect, I wonder what the pages of one-sided flagspam on this subreddit and elsewhere is doing, seeing as it's probably met a similar sized audience at a conservative estimate?

true,heffalump232,null,null,"HS2 is not about speeding up journey times and creating a high speed network necessarily. It's about relieving congestion on the West Coast Main Line so that more freight/local trains can run on it, and having failed the first time to upgrade the signalling of the WCML without severe disruption, you may as well build a brand new line that allows trains to travel at 250mph. The reason why there aren't many stations on HS2 is that it's solely for intercity trains, and often, they're pretty useless - in the French countryside there are several stations, in the middle of nowhere on TGV lines, that are empty.  

Often what seem like 'vanity' projects which seem to solve rather small issues often have rather humble main reasons for their inception and construction. For example, the platform edge doors on the Jubilee line extension aren't primarily to stop people from jumping under trains, but to allow better ventilation. When a train pulls in to a station, the air forced through by the train rises and down onto the platform.

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"&gt;I get the impression some of the unionist politicians don't actually hold the viewpoint they are expressing

The trouble with the majority of the UUP/DUP is they are both shit scarred of being out-prodded by the next unionist along. And so you have this obsession with 'unity' without it meaning much other than ""don't call me a lundy and I'll not call you one either"". Hence every single one of them speaking on the topic bar man-with-own-brain Basil McCrea has been on the subject of putting the flag back up and little else.

While I'm on the subject, I really wish McCrea was more energised. He talks a lot of sense, but he simply disappears from public view for large periods and unionism for whatever reason doesn't appear to have many like him in the public eye at the minute.

He put a fine statement out on Facebook there last week, and while I don't usually follow politics day to day (unless something gets on my nerves like reddit circlejerking...) I didn't actually see him follow it up with much action. He's going to have to change that if he wants to become MP.

Btw agree entirely with the OP.

We fixed it, technically, given that Heckler and Koch had been UK owned for some time up to this point. And it was only shitty because the US pushed for a minimum of .30 calibre in small arms, which they then reversed because the 5.56 NATO was developed in the US and its adoption was of massive benefit to their economy. And which they then overturned in turn due to its inadequate efficacy in many relevant scenarios. I mean, the .280 British was developed primarily by the UK and assisted by the Belgians, arguably world-leaders in terms of small-arms manufacture. If there are two groups that know how to make weapons of war well, they are the UK and its colonies, and France and its colonies. The Belgians do guns and beer incredibly well, and difficult as it is for many to stomach, so do the French.

Basically, the weapon system was developed around the cartridge. When the US said ""No, 7.62x54mm is the minimum we will consider"" the NATO pact countries bent to their buying power. The EM2 could not be backwards-engineered to accommodate the cartridge, necessitating the hurried adoption of the L85A1, which still outperformed all other 5.56 small arms fielded except in terms of reliability (when improperly maintained, it shoudl be noted - just because someone is employed as a soldier does not mean that they are firearms experts). Until we fixed the reliability issues, resulting in [arguably the most accurate, most reliable 5.56 NATO rifle fielded by any military](http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/SA80.htm).

* **The Christmas Invasion** (Christmas Special) - Pretty much fell in love with Tennant. The bit about ""The Lion King"" gets me every time.
* **Gridlock** (Season 3) - Nothing specific to pinpoint, but this is actually my favorite all-around episode.
* **Vincent and the Doctor** (Season 5) - The monster was super weak, but the final scene in the museum is easily my favorite in any Doctor Who episode. I've always dreamed about what it would be like to bring historical figures to the present, and that scene really hit the spot. I still cry every time I watch it!
* **The Doctor's Wife** (Season 6) - I completely disliked the subplot involving Amy and Rory, and was pretty indifferent to everything else, but the characterization and coming to life of the TARDIS was perfect.
* **Let's Kill Hitler** (Season 6) - When River was first introduced it really helped me cope with the loss of 10, because I had something to look forward to. She never disappointed me from that point on, and it was so rewarding to see the other ""end"" of her story.

Also, I really do like Eccleston and Donna despite neither being featured in this limited list.

As I said elsewere, I live in London, I'm not British. Everywhere I look and go I interact with other non-British people in shops and restaurants. Most of these are unskilled jobs. It's fair to assume that people on benefits choose not to do these jobs.

This opinion that there are generations of families where nobody has worked isn't some fringe right-wing opinion. It's the mainstream accepted political opinion.

2. Blink - Sheer Brilliance is what this episode is. No angel episode has stood close to the quality of this episode since. 

3. Partners in Crime - Again, my favorite companion is here. The Plot might not have been top notch but it was enjoyable all the same, the best bit of the episode is Tennent and Tate together, when they see each other for the first time it was hilarious. 

4. Silence in the Library/ Forest of the Dead - Another brilliant episode penned by Moffat, the introduction of River Song, a genuinely terrifying enemy, whats not to like?

5. The Impossible Astronaut/ Day of the Moon - Again, what clinched this episode for me was the introduction of a fantastic enemy. The Silence are an absolutely amazing concept plus the doctor dies in this episode, everyone loves a mystery.

The political system still doesn't work, but there is progress. I think time can heal this country, this generation (born since early 80's) coming through are becoming the 'present' rather than the 'future'. People die (of old age all being well) and memories with them.

Get religion and political undertones out of our education system. Invest heavily in our children (Our future leaders) and creating jobs for our younger population.

I'm not the only one to think these riots have come from a fear of equality more than anything else. The vast population is progressing and the 'mob' that once held NI's balls is now a minority and that counteracts mob rule. Extremists are being stood up to, that Operation Sitin and the multiple peaceful protests against the violence are testament to that.

While I'd love the UK to have an airforce two or three times as capable of what we've got, I can't argue with what we do. Eurofighter and Tornado (which on its own can carry 9 tonnes of armament), as a multirole fighter and a ground attack aircraft, have considerably exceeded the capabilities of our last strategic bomber at the strategic bombing role.

Wikipedia: An interval signal, or tuning signal, is a characteristic sound or musical phrase used in international broadcasting and by some domestic broadcasters. Played before commencement or during breaks in transmission, or (most commonly) between programmes in different languages it serves several purposes:

    It assists a listener to tune his or her radio to the correct frequency for the station.
    It informs other stations that the frequency is in use.
    It serves as a station identifier even if the language used in the subsequent broadcast is not one the listener understands.

Sure, and who laid the ball off for him?  I'll give you a hint, it rhymes with Emanuel Adebayor.


*edit*

As a side note, I just checked squawka.com because I wanted to see how defoe compared up to Adebayor.
Defore has 10 goals (I assume epl) and 33 shots on target, and 31 off target in 22 appearances.  

Adebayor has 2 goals. 12 shots on target with four off target, in 14 appearances.  He created 19 chances while defoe created 23.  (again, 14 appearances compared to 22).

I just believe that people are overly harsh on Adebayor meanwhile give defoe a lot of slack even though he is wasteful.

true,cptzaprowsdower,uk,Darlington,"I've been thinking about this a lot recently. Why don't we have a British equivalent of Starbucks that refocuses away from coffee and onto tea instead? We are a nation of tea drinkers after all, there would surely be demand for such a beverage in a quick and convenient manner, served without all the pretentions that come with the stereotypical idea of the British tea room. The product itself is tremendously simple: a tea bag is tiny, allowing for a reasonably wide range to be stocked without impacting on storage space and they have a relatively long shelf life. After that all you need is hot water and perhaps milk. It could be the next big thing: exotic teas served within a few minutes for a transient clientele of commuters and the like at train stations and airports all over the country.

There are issues though. I imagine people would balk at the idea of paying Starbucks prices for a product that could so easily be replicated at home. Part of the pleasure of the coffee house experience is that you get to enjoy a drink that you might not necessarily be able to make yourself. Moreover there are few ways you can modify a cup of tea beyond putting a bit of milk in it whereas with coffee you can throw in chocolate or cinnamon or vanilla or whatever other indulgent sugary childish shit you can think of and people are happy to pay 50p for each add on. That must make Costa et al a lot of money and you just couldn't get away with that in a tea house. You'd have to charge a fuck load for the scones or something but since people chiefly visit these places for a hot beverage then food is a source of revenue that could very easily be circumvented by the customer.

You can ignore a cold and eventually it'll go away, but you have to cut cancer out.

My impression was that the west wasn't really sure how to react. On the one hand, coup bad democracy good. OTOH though, the coup was essentially just dudes who were pissed off and wanted to make sure their country didn't fall into Islamic shitcunt hands, and that's something most people can agree with, and they have made progress in working towards kicking the shitcunts out, it's just they started in an incredibly weak position against surprisingly effective militias. So the western nations just kind of glossed over it all and let it be.

This one he finally gets back to exploring planets! I got REALLY into this story, gasping at the right parts and all. And I really loved Jo, I just saw her go a few episodes ago and miss her.

Bad Wolf/The Parting of Ways - This was the last time the Daleks were really scary to me. Loved this whole story, it made me even sadder to see Nine go. This was when Rose started growing on me too, initially I always felt like she acted too entitled.

The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit  - Because black holes. No really. I find the idea of them terrifying and I am always drawn to stories concerning them. This episode arc, the SG-1 episode with one, the Heechee saga... they are fascinating and scary all at the same time. Plus it's nice to see things unknown to even the Doctor.

His runs made room for Luis. 

They're combined movement provided space for Gerrard. 

I could go on. Regardless, I hate that we lost - but it was great to see him and Suarez out there together and see how their play is going to be together. 

I did like that his shots were down and hard. Once his form cleans up a bit we could be looking at some good scoring opportunities from those tries on goal. All-in-all I think he fits into the chemistry of the team passing and moving.

-----------Gerrard---Alonso------------

Walcott---------Suarez-------Assaidi

Bench: Ter Stegen, Kelly, Shelvey, Sturridge, Tello &amp;amp;amp;amp; Suso. 

Other players. Sterling, Raphael Varane, Douglas, Kerim Frei, Coates, Henderson, Wisdom, Robinson,  Brad Jones + quite a few more youngsters.

Currently thinking of selling Walcott as he's demanding far too much money. He's on 85k/pw but wants 110. Thinking of bringing in Alexis Sanchez and keeping Sterling as his back up until he gets of age. 

Back like will need replacing soon, but I have Coates, Varane (fantastic and cheap) and Douglas.

Singh is my own CAM who starts out at about 78/79ish in his first season but hits mid 80s in his second season. Just as Captain Fantastic himself starts to decline. 

It's also the most beautiful and heartbreaking thing to pair up Gerrard and Alonso one last time before they both retire, I usually get around two seasons with them both but Gerrard declines pretty quickly. Lowest I've seen him get is 76.

2 Champions League titles.

I love his ability to roll defenders and find the space in between the defense and midfield, but it's when we're not in possession that makes me hesitant to do this long term. Ideally I'd want Suarez floating around the halfway line, recieving the ball and starting the counter attack, but as the apex of our midfield 3 he's going to have to track back and defend when we're not in possession. Id love for him to be able to have a free role, but I don't think that would be possible for many reasons, the main one IMO is Gerrard's lack of defensive discipline.

I was genuinely terrified of the host. He creeped me out so much. Plus 10/Rose in this episode are adorable, and their bet still makes me laugh.

3. The Unicorn and The Wasp - I love the episodes that go back in time. They fascinate me. Plus the chemistry between 10/Donna is just amazing. I also adore the kitchen scene just after The Doctor has been poisoned with cyanide, it makes me laugh every time.

4. Vincent and The Doctor - I don't particularly like the monster in this episode but omg. As a lover of art, it made me appreciate how much pain and suffering Van Gogh went through. It still makes me tear up every time. I just love it.

5. School Reunion -  I love Sarah Jane in this episode. The chemistry between all of the cast just works for me. Plus I love Anthony Head playing an evil character, he pulls it off so well.

Not much. The government already taxes it enough and my understanding is that alcohol related crime has been falling over the last decade or so anyway (in line with violent crime which has also fallen). I'm sure some town centres could do with town planning and management though.

But, that raises the question of whom will our strikers be at the start of next season? I think Ba will likely still be here but if Torres goes and Lukaku wants another year at WBA who do we bring in that won't scare Lukaku off for good thats still world-class enough to start for the blues.

Burchill is a troll and always has been, in the print world she was quite unusual, though never subtle and only briefly interesting (a long time ago).

I guess all I'm trying to get at is that strikers are different animals. I'm hoping he becomes a world-class all around CF but I'm also hoping he gets his fair shot at Chelsea.

I'm afraid that if he stays at WBA for a few years, gets comfortable with their playstyle and his surroundings and then comes back to Chelsea that he will need much more time to adapt. For a young player, especially a striker, ""time to adapt"" comes at a premium at Stamford Bridge.

I'd hate to recall him at the end of the year to have him ride the pine for another year and lose all hope but if Torres is on his way out at the end of the season (which is looking likely), we'll only have Demba Ba and Piazon to carry the load for the 4+ competitions we'll be in. 

We could recall Lukaku but he'll have to be okay with being, at least at the start of the season (depending how this one ends of course), the second choice striker. I don't think he would mind that much as him and shane long share time at WBA and competition for places is never a bad thing in my opinion.

Or, we could let him stay at WBA for another year but that will leave us with Demba Ba and Piazon (assuming Torres' departure) which is a disaster waiting to happen. Do we go big and bring in a guy like Falcao or get someone cheaper? If CFC splashes the cash on another big name striker I think it might not go over well with Lukaku knowing that there's really no reason for him to come back to Chelsea as he will certainly be on the bench.

I hope he scores another 10+ goals by the end of the season and we keep him for next year. Hopefully Ba can stay fit or that'll be a massive load to put on 20 year old shoulders.

I don't know your age, and I'm certainly not intending to diss the young, but this is obviously a skill which comes with experience and maturity (for most people, there are always exceptions in both directions).  It's not as simple as putting the drinking age up, as the US experience of different age limits shows, but anecdotally, it does seem to be assisted by responsible introduction to alcohol by parents as a child grows up, and broader social education about how to drink sensibly, and later as an adult, to enjoy a buzz without becoming a fucked up mess on a given night or over the course of a drinking career with all the personal, health and social problems that can cause.

Two other points.  Firstly, we don't seem to be able to address our major cultural issue with drinking, which is that we prefer to drink but not eat at the same time, which has significant health and intoxication implications.  And, secondly, there's the whole gamut of personal, mental health, cultural and social issues which feed in to people's relationship with alcohol, and none of these are going to be addressed by simply making alcohol more expensive/difficult to acquire/weaker.  Why are so many of us so isolated, repressed and or socially unconfident that we need alcohol as a lubricant to intercourse (in all its senses)?  Then there are all those self-medicating more substantial mental health issues (whether or not it's a good idea/effective): anxiety, depression, OCD, addictions, even major psychoses.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This probably isn't very interesting but here goes. My mom used to mention Doctor Who occasionally when the series premiered again with 9. I was a teenager at the time and dismissed it as something I could never watch. I didn't find my love of science fiction until I was a little older and often poked fun at hers. I kept hearing about the show everywhere for years and then I saw it all over the internet. I stumbled upon this subreddit at the beginning of last year. I think I can honestly say that I fell in love with the fanbase before I fell in love with the show. I had no idea what any of the references meant but I loved all the crafty things people were making based on the show. I had no clue what was up with the flying blue box or the glowing stick that resembled a magic wand, what was this man a doctor of and why did he have so many pretty young girls assisting him? I had to know, I had to watch it for myself. Still, I procrastinated for a few months, choosing to watch other shows on Netflix instead. Then one late night, I was having trouble sleeping. My husband had gone up to bed hours before and most series we watch together. I needed something different, something new. I scanned the genres on Netflix and saw those words again superimposed over that beautiful blue box I kept seeing everywhere. I finally selected Doctor Who and I never slept again (just kidding but I'm sure some of you know the feeling). As I type this, I'm now re-watching the series with my husband with this big smile on my face because I know he has a wonderful journey ahead of him.

I also think that if we are playing all 3 of them, we need to have better passers of the ball in the non-DM pivot player and also probably the striker, it's pretty much a tika-taka 3 who need to have players to pass quickly to and receive quick passes from, or a proper deep lying midfielder that can use their creativity.

Hazard and Oscar are showing many signs of promise and that's really all we can ask of them to be fair. In my opinion: I think it's unfair to expect them to carry the team, and yet they kind of do (Lampard helps a lot also). Torres has scored 7 goals in the league, while look at Van Persie(17) and Dzeko(10)/Tevez(7)/Aguero(8). It seems like a world class striker is the difference from a 3-6 spot and a 1-2 spot.

true,sacredstones,null,null,"Sturridge has completely changed our game. With sturridge, we have someone to stretch the field by threatening the back line. Now Suarez is allowed to drop even deeper than before. which means that his brilliant pressing of the ball is done in the midfield, which puts a LOT more pressure on the opposition. Suarez in the midfield stifled Carrick, who was absolutely thrashing us earlier and his presence in the midfield also freed up space for Gerrard and Allen to run their game. 

Many people have been talking about Suarez as a CAM rather than a striker and I was one of those hoping to see this happen (been doing this in FIFA13 :P). He didn't dissapoint. He proved that he has an effortless range of passing and his tackling ability is more than sufficient for a CAM. He also knows how to find space. We all knew this, but now with an option up front, him getting the ball doesn't mean attempting a potentially wasteful dribble. And if he does need to take a dribble, it'll be against less defenders as Sturridge can always make runs to provide more space. 

I'm really intrigued and partially worried as to what Rodgers will do next game. His lineups are sometimes questionable (Downing in and Hendo out?) and we have yet to see what he's going to do on a normal basis now that Sturridge is in. Next game will tell. I personally hope to god that we stick with this 4-2-3-1 with Suarez in the midfield. Yes, it means that Hendo and probably Allen will have to sit out some games, but goodness was it brilliant today against very good opposition.

Tea

One or two Americans have asked me why the English like tea so much, which never seems to them to be a very good drink. To understand, you have to make it properly.

There is a very simple principle to the making of tea, and it’s this—to get the proper flavour of tea, the water has to be boilING (Not boilED) when it hits the tea leaves. If it’s merely hot, then the tea will be insipid. That’s why we English have these odd rituals, such as warming the teapot first (so as no to cause the boiling water to cool down too fast as it hits the pot). And that’s why American habit of bringing a teacup, a tea bag, and a pot of hot water to the table is merely the perfect way of making a tin, pale, watery cup of tea that nobody in their right mind would want to drink. The Americans are all mystified about why the English make such a big thing out of tea because most Americans HAVE NEVER HAD A GOOD CUP OF TEA. That’s why they don’t understand. In fact, the truth of the matter is that most English people don’t know how to make tea anymore either, and most people drink cheap instant coffee instead, which is a pity, and gives Americans the impression that the English are just generally clueless about hot stimulants.

So the best advice I can give to an American arriving in England is this: Go to Marks and Spencer and buy a packet of Earl Grey tea. Go back to where you’re staying and boil a kettle of water. While it is coming to the boil, open the sealed packet and sniff. Careful---you may feel a bit dizzy, but this is in fact perfectly legal. When the kettle has boiled, pour a little of it into a teapot, swirl it around, and tip it out again. Put a couple (or three, depending on the size of the pot) of tea bags into the pot. (If I was really trying to lead you into the paths of righteousness, I would tell you to use free leaves rather than bags, but let’s just take this in easy stages.) Bring the kettle back up to the boil, and then pour the boiling water as quickly as you can into the pot. Let is stand for two or three minutes, and then pour it into a cup. Some people will tell you that you shouldn’t have milk with Earl Grey, just a slice of lemon. Screw them. I like it with milk. If you think you will like it with milk, then it’s probably best to put some milk into the bottom of the cup before you pour in the tea. If you pour milk into a cup of hot tea, you will scald the milk. If you think you will prefer it with a slice of lemon, then, well, add a slice of lemon.

Drink it. After a few moments you will begin to think that the place you’ve come to isn’t maybe quite so strange and crazy after all.

Because you're attributing far too much intelligence them - how many of them were studying or similar to change their circumstances?

Because then the money they're raising is traceable, and nobody can run off with it (for a start). And they don't even have to be charities they've set up themselves, I was thinking more along the lines of *any registered charities* they've worked for.

The registered charities they work for would still have records of raising N amount of cash - otherwise I could insist that I've worked in soup kitchens every night for the past year (and assert that it's up to you to prove I didn't, etc.).

Overall, yes it does - because with no details or registration, they're no different from someone running a business with no registration, etc. and someone who runs a limited company paying tax, etc. - as a 'sole trader' you can pretend you're running the biggest company in the world, but if it isn't so on paper, nobody's going to listen.

You can't get a work permit in this country unless the FA endorse you and to endorse you you have to meet certain requirements. These are for non EU players.

You have to play in 75% of your nations competitive international games over I believe two years (qualifying and major tournaments such as Euros, ACON etc.) + the team you play in has to have been in the top 70 FIFA ranked teams for what I believe to be 3 years I think. if not it gets turned down and then you move onto a appeal where a special talent endorsement can be given... normally for players like Oscar, Neymar, Messi if he came to england first etc. 

In countries such as Holland, Belgium etc. they have a different policy where the club has to pay a certain minimum wage to get the player a work permit. Once he has that, he can play for three years in countries such as belgium, Holland and Portugal to get an EU residency. 

Spain have a special rule for South American people also, which would explain a high proportion of Southern Americans plying their trade in La Liga before foraging Europe

I believe this was the case for Alex as he came straight from Santos in 2004 and has only played 18 games internationally for Brazil between 2003-2012, most probably being friendlies.

Clubs such as Porto, Benfica and Ajax/Psv use this benefit with their business model. ",0,1358159311,null,0,false,0,c7wmww8,t3_16j9t9,t1_c7wmww8,t1_c7wkend,null,1430955646,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

I use this example a lot, but look at C Ronaldo. When he first moved to United, he was tiny. He bulked up and became a beast, and now he has both the skill *and* the strength to allow him to use that skill unhindered. I think Moses is actually a lot more useful than people give him credit for on the basis that he is a bloody tank, and he adds to strength that the rest of the attacking midfield lack.

If our midfielders could bulk up enough to hold players off (but obviously not too much that it slows them down) I reckon they would be insane.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;People used supposedly scientific tests to prove that black people were inferior to whites in the USA, when the only thing they proved was cultural difference.

You don't need scientific tests to prove you raised X through working for a charity.

&gt;Similarly, you're setting up a question which simply shows how gipsies and travellers don't work within our cultural system of charitable businesses.

I was asking if they'd done any stuff for charities outside their own - which there would be records of if they had. Not sure whose culture insists that you can't do any fundraising if it's for a registered charity - surely if this sort of thing was rife amongst Gypsies, then not only would have some charitable works/ fundraising be traceable, but it would be a news item in itself - 'Gyspies give back to local comminuty' and so on. But you've hit the nail on the thumb by describing them as being outside our cultural system of charitable business - if that's the prevailing attitude they operate on, it's then very hard to make any demands on (or complain about) a system you've openly rejected.

&gt;Why would this matter unless someone has decided that an entire people-group are worthless, or inferior, or somehow below the rest of us, and are scraping around for reasons to prove it?

true,[deleted],null,null,"The Orange isn't anti-Catholic it is just pro-Protestant, which may appear similar to outsiders but are very different. The Orange is a religious organization it opens each meeting with prayer, (unfortunately probably the only prayer some members might ever say) the nature of Protestantism is it believes the dogma of the Catholic Church to be wrong and non-biblical, a Catholic wouldn't be capable of receiving the full benefits of Orangism as its teaches contradict that of the church they subscribe to. I'll admit there may be an issue regarding converts.

People who have little experiences of Orangism will happily believe it to be sectarian as they see little evidence otherwise, the charity work taken by lodges is early publicised, and the only time its in the news is the 12th night when there is riots in the Ardoynne AFTER they have passed through on their way home. Other sources of information rarely come from unbiased sources and any positive aspects that Orangism produces simply doesn't fit into some peoples world view, so I'd dismissed. This is of course ignoring the history of the Orange having no PR presence whatsoever. 

Lately the Grand Secretary addressed the Irish Senate in an official capacity, a job he could not have taken if he was sectarian. The Covenant parade in September had 3 issues that the press took up 2 of which were rouge band members 1 of which was a bigot who was there for political gain, let's not forget that the parade organisers tried to have talks with locals but were shunned over the use if the word parishioner over resident.
There is also a programme going on at the moment teaching young leaders about these issues and how to tackle them, and this is an acredited course by Queen's University.

At the moment the penalties for illegal downloads are in the form of civil prosecution and fines that can be quite hefty because they're based on an 1988 law regarding copyright theft that was written in a time that couldn't reflect the current nature of copyright theft that has a hard time distinguishing from a couple of songs and mass downloads. 

As such fines can be quite hefty (many thousands of pounds) but will usually only be heard in the Magistrates court.
 
Compared to the States, I think the UK laws are quite lax and prosecuting individuals is taking second place to chasing site owners, but I would imagine that the American model will soon move its way over here..

I discuss the issues I have with unionism on submissions where the OP/general thrust of the comments aren't clearly just another cybernat bullying session. I'm capable of seeing good points when they are made and voting accordingly.

Of course I know both these two points will continue to be ignored by the cybernats in their retorts to all the evidence I have shown that this subreddit has a problem with nationalist redditors voting according to political outlook.

4x4s have much longer breaking distances compared to almost any cars due to their weight (especially on higher grip surfaces wear they suffer badly from body lean - due to their high centre of gravity - which compounds the problem).

Engine breaking only aids breaking in situations where the breaks are incapable of dissipating enough energy on their own.

I think the biggest problem I have with this brouhaha is the idea that if you dislike what someone says in a newspaper column, you should call for their dismissal and/or advocate that they be prosecuted for hate speech (which many commenters on the Guardian seem to be saying).  The best way to counter bad arguments is with good arguments.  It's not by silencing your opponents. 

Burchill's a polemicist and a good one.  She also happens to be a talented writer, with some great turns of phrase.  I think the world would be poorer without a few Burchills and if she's not your cup of tea then nobody's forcing you to read her.  

I'm sure the newspaper will provide a right of reply to those who feel offended, but in all honesty, I think the Guardian should turn around to her critics and say 'screw you, she can write what she wants'.  

Edit:  Predictably, the first response of many here is to downvote my comment, instead of engaging in debate.  Is this really the Reddit you want?  Where only popular ideas are given prominence?

This is the saddest thing, the power the media has over our country. Yes, thinking about it without all the hyperbole, David Cameron isn't a stupid man. He obviously knows the facts behind drugs, and how much actual harm they can do to people.

Perhaps there needs to be some sort of mad political rush. All of a sudden, the government pushes several unpopular (with the media), progressive policies all at the same time. The media melts down trying to provoke outrage over them all at once. The public wonders what the hell is going on and actually puts a small amount of logical thought into figuring out what these policies mean on their own, eventually deciding that yes, the government is probably right on most/some of them and hey, maybe a government that's brave enough to do that kind of thing is worth keeping around.

For example. You recently said regarding the effect of the protests.
&gt;Everyone? Hasn't effected me. Or the vast majority of NI for that matter so quit the hyperbole.

Whereas the protests as of a few weeks ago had cost £7 Million in policing and had cost the local economy an estimated £15 Million in lost trade. It was also confirmed that external investors have 'gone cold' of the idea of investing in Northern Ireland. That doesn't mean they've officially pulled out but a few more weeks and they will.

Come the end of the month when the bills are due for restaurants they wont have that healthy cash reserve they normally build up to get them through the slow months (January to March) and job cuts and closures could follow shortly. 

Our only saving grace is that the biggest tourism event this year is the Police and Fire games and they are the least likely to be put off by security concerns.

&gt;(the illegal drugs are usually cut to increase profits and offset the risks taken in supplying them

And your point is? When you buy illegal drugs, even through a dealer you trust *you can not know what is actually in them*. That's a risk most people are happy to take and the reduction of that risk with legal highs is something you have to take in to account that it's also one of the reasons people argue for the legalisation of the actual drugs. 
  

&gt; Also the compounds in illegal drugs are usually far less harmful than their ""legal high"" variations. Take methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), methylone or mephedrone, they're far more harmful than say MDMA (one of the illegal drugs they are trying to replicate).

Can I have sources for that research please? On the one had you are talking about these drugs having no track record but on the other saying definitively they are more dangerous.  Which is not to say they are not, I presume that they actually are, but again I'm just pointing out that the legal highs often cross over the risk/reward threshold.

&gt;Also the quality control on legal highs coming out of these labs can't be strenuous enough to ensure every batch is of equal strength. Also the formulations of these drugs vary all the time and aren't documented. I'd say that the legal highs suffer from exactly the same issues with quality that the illegal ones do. The legal high market is just as unregulated as the illegal market.

These shops and labs are raided every other month, they exist purely on technicality and the only way to avoid jail is to be sure that everything is technically correct. So for the most part you can be sure that what they say is in something is all that is in it because if it's not they end up in a lot of trouble. You just have to be aware that the same name/pack can actually have different content (but I'm pretty sure what is it in needs to be listed correctly on the back of the pack, or at lest that's what I've been told by the people who use/work in these place but maybe I misunderstood) 

Again I agree this is silly, the actual drugs should be decriminalised but this the reality of how things stand on that front 

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/16j1en/decriminalise_drugs_inquiry_by_crossparty_peers/

&gt;David Cameron said the current policy was working in the UK.

It's not going to happen. However what is happening here is that legal highs are exploiting a loop hole that it's almost imposable to close and going after every individual type is become a huge waste of time and effort because another one just pops up. 

By actually accepting that legal highs exist and seeking to regulate them and reduce their harm we have not only something good that is more likely to be able be put in place with out having to over come base drug policy. Imagine the example that this could set for later used for the benefits of such a change?

There is no way currently we are going to see major changes on illegal drugs but a more regulated and safe legal high market would be a good thing *for all the same reasons*. 

It's currently being rejected for all the same reasons but it's a place we are likely to see more traction than with the main illegal drugs.",0,1358174321,null,0,1358174642,0,c7wot50,t3_16ix60,t1_c7wot50,t1_c7wognt,null,1430956570,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I can give some of those a bash. 

If by college system, you mean education after 18? It's called University over here. Standard degree(a bachelors) is three years long. Typically the first year doesn't count towards your final degree ""grade,"" so you can party a bit here :P Dunno what the culture of post 18 ed is like in NZ, but here, it can be a bit skewed towards drinking, especially at the start. The first week is called ""freshers week,"" and for the most part, involves silly course introductions and then going out every night. There are often other night activities on though, if going out/drinking isn't quite your cup of tea. Quick word on the grading: you'll hear people say ""first, two-one, two-two,"" that's just how degrees/degree level stuff is graded. A first is &gt;=70%, a two-1(2:1) is &gt;=60%, a two-two(not what you wear in ballet,2:2,) is &gt;=50% and a pass is anything greater than 40%.


Politics,hm. I can try give that a swing briefly, but I'm a Pharmacy student, so unless it involves the NHS, I don't know whole a lot ;) The lot in power are wankers, any other party could do the job fine. Tends to be a lot of the prevailing attitude, no matter who exactly is in power :P

More seriously. The main three parties are: labour, conservatives and liberal democrats. At current, there is a coalition in power, between the ""tories""(conservatives,) and lib-dems. The leader of the lib dems, Nick Clegg gets a lot of hate for reneging on some of his promises, especially towards students - he said he was against raising tuition fees, which promptly got tripled with this new government(for UK students.) Although, with him being only the deputy PM, he can't really control everything... So if you want to make some witty remark to fellow students about politics, make some jibe towards old Cleggy, and it'll be fine. 

Economy: down the shitter, but isn't it the same everywhere? Again, Pharmacy student here, not an econ one. Typically the job market/pay is better the close you get to London, however, the living cost also increases - to crazy amounts if you're actually in the capital itself. Given the size of the country, if you're interested in travelling around a bit, living in the North East isn't a large issue, trains are decent enough most of the time, and if you can get yourself a 16-25 Railcard, the cost is manageable. 6~hrs on a train/coach can get you anywhere in the country, no matter where you start off really. 

And wayaye pet, you better hope to get your heed around some of the dialect up there ;)

We're taking the most shots per match, but how many of them are even good shots? I'd say we're creating less quality chances this season than last season. On the other hand, United are top of the league and aren't even in the top 5 for shots taken. This backs up my opinion that our squad, as a whole, aren't playing patiently enough for Rodgers' liking - too many shots outside the box, too many crosses without bodies populating the box, too many weak or poor shots resulting from weak or poor chances. I think we often try to force things in the final third rather than wait for opportunities to appear.

Aerial duels seems a little bit of a stupid one to care about that much - if you're in the bottom 4 or 5, it's an issue, but after that who cares?

Lets say that of the £55m that £15m goes to the house for stadium costs, fees etc.  With £40m you could pay for Mouts, Son and Alderweireld and even at high values that would be a £2m cash outlay, you could do Damiao/Mouts for the same price, What about Willian/Isco for £40? Maher/Erickson/Son/Alderweireld for ~ £40m?

There is a price for getting between two stations, and you may take whichever route you so wish. There are surcharges for reserved seating and some express trains, but because almost every service is named and numbered it's very easy to know what you need for which.

I hate buying tickets to London because there are about 10 different types of return and when you're booking at a machine in the station it gives you no prompt as to which ticket to buy.",0,1358176447,null,0,false,0,c7wp96d,t3_16jw5j,t1_c7wp96d,t3_16jw5j,null,1430956990,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Example - it costs me and three others travelling from Essex to London about five times more to use train and tube than it does to drive there and pay for parking.

Another example is of local buses. In order to travel about 1 or 2 miles from home into town, it costs almost £5 return. I don't use anywhere near that in petrol, and parking is free or 10p.

So until public transport is shown to be more cost effective than using the car, it just isn't convenient.

I just think it's silly to ignore this idea, which is a step towards   decriminalization simply because it's not the end game.

&gt;there is plenty of research into how safe MDMA is and also about it's therapeutic value, there is very little research into the legal highs.

Saying that MDMA is most likely safe is not saying legal high versions are not and if you are going to say that a given drug is dangerous provide proof else you are acting exactly like the people who want to keep all drugs illegal regardless of what research.

true,EJR94,lfcflame,,"You know what, this may sound mad but we don't need anymore first team players. Sure, you look at the league position and think why the hell not? Well, Rodgers has a group of players that he's molding into his type of player. We've seen players make huge advancements to their development and it'd be a waste to hinder than. We are seeing now that the team is improving, Sturridge/Borini was the missing link a poacher who will work hard for the team but, most importantly, will score rebounds and generally get into the box. We will see the goals on a regular basis now I believe, but we still may be prone to the irregular ""off day"". 

Starting next season, this is how I see our squad being used.

First team against non-defensive teams

Reina
Johnson - Skrtel - Agger - Enrique
------Lucas
Gerrard - Henderson
-----Suarez
Borini - Sturridge

This requires both Gerrard and Henderson to advance into the left and right channels, providing support for Enrique and Johnson to act as wingers whilst we're on the ball. Lucas will play a holding role to halt any counter attack and ensure our midfield isn't over ran. I can see Borini occasionally moving into one flank and Suarez taking up a position on another when we look to work the ball into the box more

First Team against much lower opposition
Reina
Johnson - Skrtel - Agger - Enrique
Lucas
Gerrard - Shelvey
Suarez - Sturridge - Borini

The emphasis will be on attack, since these teams will attempt to park the bus. The idea is to score 3-4 early on and pass around to drain any energy which could lead to the opposition scoring. Gerrard and Shelvey will push right forward and Lucas (or Allen) will sit behind and feed any balls he picks up to them. Borini, Sturridge and Suarez will rotate and team up to play the ball through the defenders and force them to lump the ball back to Skrtel/Agger. 

Lastly, first team against better opposition (especially away)

Reina
Johnson - Skrtel - Agger - Enrique
Lucas - Allen/Gerrard
Henderson
Sterling - Downing
Suarez

This formation asks a lot of Suarez, he will have limited support and we will be on the back foot. We played similar to this against United, but it didn't pay off, maybe because we're not used to it. Sterling and Downing will track back and help out by cancelling their wide players. Henderson, Lucas and Gerrard will form a tight 3 man midfield, trying to open space to keep possession but stopping the opposing team from dictating too much play. The team need to play deeper and Lucas should look to stop them playing through the middle. Long balls to Suarez and Sterling with Downing should break forward and come inward to offer options instead of having to cross the ball to one man. Boring as it is to watch, it should help us keep the game close until the end where we can bring on fresh attackers and try a score a couple. May not have worked against United, but with Sterling improving and getting better at multiple systems we should win.


Also we have the following players than can step in incase of any injuries/suspensions/poor form:
Robinson, Kelly, Wisdom, Coates, Coady, Allen, Shelvey, Suso, Sterling, Downing and potentially Yesil and Morgan.. This makes quite a strong squad so to bring it back to the point, we may not need anyone.

Large companies today are sitting on huge cash reserves, yet they are not investing in staff and infrastructure because demand is low, and the forecast is bleak. Demand drives growth, not profits. I think it's far more likely that company directors would just use the extra ~20% of profits to take out larger dividends for themselves.

I think to make it even vaguely feasible, you'd have to remove tax free breaks and generally increase dividend income taxes. Otherwise, money that would have been injected back into the economy via tax revenue and spending, would end up sitting in an investment portfolio somewhere, hence reducing the velocity of money and shrinking the economy.",0,1358181130,null,0,false,0,c7wqfdz,t3_16jra9,t1_c7wqfdz,t1_c7wq45n,null,1430957867,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Agreed on the patience point, but I think it's also a lack of incisiveness and movement. More times than not, we rely on Suarez to create those chances, just passing the ball to him and watching him do his thing. There's no movement around him, usually only an option for a backwards pass. One of the positive things about moving to CAM is that he has options and movement around him to play off of, although I'm still skeptical that's his best long term position for us.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;I don't see this as being a viable step to legalising or decriminalising traditional drugs, I see it as a logically indefensible move.

You say that but you've yet to offer a reason other that ""because I say so"".
 
&gt;Why do you think it's better to legalise drugs with no evidence for their safety over drugs with years of widespread public use and research?

I don't and no reading of what I'm actually saying should come close to implying that I do. 

For some messed up reason we have a legal system in which given drugs are illegal but compounds almost exactly those drugs can be sold as products ""not for human consumption"". Current two of those substances have been banned from production and sale (but not illegal to actually own) and have already been replaced with new compounds. 

So there is two things the government can do, it can follow it's current policy which is to make those legal compounds illegal and keep playing whack a mole or it can control and regulate production. 

The point here is not that this makes any logical sense at all, it doesn't, but that by pushing for policy to control what are effectively *new* drugs rather than criminalise them we make people safer and have a actual starting point for the argument to decimalise those old drugs that are already illegal.

I'm simply saying if we are being pragmatic the place to start with getting old drugs decriminalised to to have in place a system that does not criminalise new ones but regulates them in an attempt to reduce harm. You can argue with the logic that has lead to the *need* for that pragmatism all you like and I'll be in full agreement but the move it's self, in context, can be see as a positive step. 

If things where working logically and based on the evidence this report would have the government saying ""Yes, ok, that makes sense given what we are seeing in other countries"". That's not happening so while we press for things like simply making weed legal we should also be on the look out for anything else that helps us over turn the idiotic polices in place.

It's one thing to lob a snowball at someone and move on, but if it's a gang of 10 kids packing ice balls targeting one (usually vulnerable) person, it quickly turns into something a bit more sinister.

true,haywire,eng-sussex,Brighton,"&gt; What oppression do you speak of, other than the refusal to recognise that the removal of genitals does not make a man a woman?

Opinions don't exist in a vacuum. Perhaps you hold your opinion and make sure nobody ever is affected by it - if so, great! But when you have a large amount of people holding this opinion, it leads to things like feelings of being deceived when faced with a trans person that passes, and violence. 

When you say someone isn't ""normal"" it opens them up to abuse by people with anger issues and fear of the unknown.

Lets take the example of racism - say a whole country secretly believes that Jews aren't pulling their weight, and are undermining the good parts of society and leading to it's destruction (or Pakistanis, Gypsies, Polish...whatever). Now, that's just waiting for a catalyst such as a powerful orator and desperate times, and what easier scapegoat than something people already suspect/hate?

So if you don't attack people for having a damaging opinion, such as believing that transgendered people aren't ""proper"" women, it opens the door to a whole load of abuse because people believe that by acting on their opinions (of which yours is moderate, but there exist many more extremes) they are doing something righteous. So, transphobia is something that needs to be fought at every level to prevent abuse of transgendered people.

Out of interest, why do you limit yourself to these ideas about gender and sex?

I posted a neutral comment about Willie Frazer, providing a link to an interview where he talks about his background. It included none of the outspoken views on politics that he's more (in)famous for. Just background information on his life growing up. I then went on to point out he has been known to associate with UVF terrorists and ran a club where they carried out a double murder. I stated that for some that would be sufficient reasonable grounds for a level of hatred towards him. But taken in the context of the trauma he endured growing up, I wondered how I'd turn out if in a similar situation.

This neutral point of view was too much for many redditors on here, downvoting it again and again without any reasonable response.

Same with my response to an upvoted nationalist comment along the lines of 'the Tricolour represents us all anyway'. I pointed out the Union flag has similar representation in it's symbolism. Downvoted immediately, as time and again it's been proven that pointing out a reasonable pro-union point of view is not tolerated by the active nationalists on the sub.

If they are downvoting a comment simply because I generally give a unionist perspective, then they're still guilty of intolerance against a differing point of view.

&gt;which I think it's whats happening to you except you blame it all on cyber-nats.

I doubt anyone else would bother obsessing over what I post; most non-active redditors who agree with me have been avoiding this sub of late. After all as I keep having to point out I'm only posting in response to nationalist intolerance; if someone 'from a neutral pov' was to downvote my posts alone then they aren't really keeping up that facade of neutrality very well by simultaneously ignoring the majority of submissions on this board recently.

&gt;So do you still stand by your statement that it hasn't affected the 'Majority of NI'?

Yes of course. Not everyone in NI is a restaurant owner in Belfast. While I sympathise with their plight (I have a feeling business outside the Belfast urban area will have picked up due to all this, not that I'm saying that's a positive, just that it emphasises my point that there is a finite limit on the adverse affects), and anyone somehow losing trade or inconvenienced by this ill-advised episode, I'm not going to sit and listen to post after post breathlessly claiming the world is ending due to flag protests. 

If people were really interested in beating the protests, they'd be carrying on their business as normal in order to defeat the attention seekers. That there needs to be a 'hashtag' or some other organised effort for people to see this just highlights for me personally that it's not just the protesters guilty of stupidity here.

If you are making a point on cost being borne by all of us sure, I accept that. But you're still blowing things out of proportion: £7m is a fiver per person. A fiver that could be better spent elsewhere undoubtedly, but enough to have an actual effect on the majority of us either positively or negatively? 

No. 

Similarly God knows the number of times similar amounts are being wasted by politically-driven bad decisions within regional government but is any one specific case enough to make a material difference to me or the majority of people in the street? 

No. 

Taken together, yes of course eventually mistakes all add up.

Now *that's* a strawman. This isn't a governmental thing at all.  This is about changing culture by talking to people and campaigning for things. Changing how people think by talking about stuff.

&gt; People have the right to be racist or sexist or trans ""phobic"" (I put it in quotes because phobias are irrational fears and I don't think it's the correct term). The law should only be involved if those thoughts translate to actions, such as violence.

Yes, doesn't make them not arseholes.

&gt; You mean hermaphrodites? There is a known medical cause for this sort of condition and as such they are not really considered to be a 'third gender'.

That sort of area but it isn't just hermaphrodites. It's more realising that stuff isn't as clear cut as we like to think - remember, science is not always 1:1 with reality (though that is the goal), and especially when you get issues like this, and psychology, science can often reflect cultural aspects at the time that theories were devised. This is why people are revisiting gender and sex, and applying more modern theories to it such as neuroscience.

I mean, there must be some explanation as to why someone can be born with a male body but suffer immensely due to feeling that they should have a female body.

Dominates in the air and on the ground in the very rough and physical Tippeliga (similar in style to the championship), the europa league and for the national team. I've seen him play games where hes won every single header, and hes not exactly afraid of taking on anyone.

 Very cool with the ball and has an excellent left foot for long range passing. Used to be almost too cool and nonchalant when he was younger, but he seems to have grown out of it.

His only weakness is his pace, not glacial, but not particularly fast either, though he does make up for it with anticipation, and somehow he always seems ""fast enough"". 

Was discovered quite late, and util he was 19 he played 4th tier football and worked part time at a supermarket :). Was close to going to the Bundesliga already after his first season in the TL, but had a poor start to his second season (a bit full of himself and fond of a night out). Solskjær sorted that out when he came to the club and now he has a more professional and mature attitude. Has really taken strides the last season.

This is what I'd want to see but it also *will not happen* and there is a marked difference between doing the above with a substance that is illegal in pretty much every respect and one that is currently not illegal but not actually rated for human consumption.

&gt;I agree with you that the current system is not based on logic or evidence. I also don't see how replacing it with your proposed system is any better.

Because no matter how crazy it would be to seek to control and regulate legal versions of illegal drugs instead of just doing so with the illegal drug in the first place it would have us rating and controlling these kinds of drugs in a logical evidence based manner. It will reduce harm and provide us with a place to say ""look at how well this works and how stupid is it that we are not doing it with illegal drugs"".

The whole mess is already absurd and I'm simply in favour of anything that would progress the debate and have us applying these logical ideas of protection and control to something rather than nothing in the hopes that it would move towards better policy over all. 

To be honest this is not something that is really going to happen either, we are more likely to see weed legalisation first but there's no harm in talking about it because it at lest bring to mind how utterly bonkers the whole mess is to any one who two brain cells to rub together.

This looks like it's an anagram of ""sell used car by"" and the answer is a dancing judge.  I wonder if it's the name of one of the judges on Strictly Come Ballroom Dancing or whatever it's called (sorry, don't watch it).

&gt; 16AC: Spaced out old officer?

You're on the right lines with constable.  For the first word, think of ""spaced out"" as in ""on drugs"".  Their full title is ""Lord XXXX Constable"" (I had to check this on Wikipedia - bit of an unusual term)

&gt; 5DN: Sheep farmer in old enclosure

The ""enclosure"" here is a hint that the answer is hidden in the words of the clue.  Given the letters that you've got, it can only be one thing.  I didn't recognise the word, but google tells me it's a kind of sheep.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I don't quite understand anyone's high horse mentality in regards to money, and Arsenal fans in particular wear it like a badge of honor. This chip on their shoulder about oil sheikhs and player wages and shit is fucking nauseating. Read any thread on /r/soccer about finances and you'll probably find 2 things: 1) A devineman comment buried at the bottom and 2) Cannon crests spouting the same 3-4 cliches about buying the title. How many posts by Arsenal fans have you seen that more or less say ""I wouldn't like our club if we spent lots of money. We are much classier than that!"" ? 

This idea that people at the top level of their profession should ply their trade for a fraction of their market value simply because they play for such a ""classy"" football club is absolutely fucking ludicrous. Arsenal fans act as if these people were talentless hacks who owe their entire livelihoods to Arsenal. It's a pitiful viewpoint. Players are not commodities; they are human beings with ambition. Each and every professional footballer got to where they are through a massive amount of hard work and personal belief. Sure, many of them developed massively at Arsenal, and that's why the club receives a hefty transfer fee following their departures. 

Almost to a man, these players who have left Arsenal have been vindicated. Nasri and Clichy now make more money AND win trophies. Fabregas has already won a few trophies but will surely win at least one more this season. RVP makes the money that one of the world's top players deserves, and it looks quite likely he'll end this season with a PL title. 

It's as if their club is entirely set up to give fans moral high ground to grovel for. They have an egalitarian wage structure that is pretty much the most inefficient and horribly-conceived system in the country. They manage to pay players like Gervinho more than we were paying Modric, yet they don't pay their truly world class players half of what they deserve. I call it stupid, they call it ""classy"". 

So many of their fans don't even realize what suckers they are. A few of the good ones on /r/soccer do (not the knee-jerking 'Wenger out' dipshits; the people who realize their board is underachieving) but many more go on spewing the same bullshit about ""principles"" and ""class"". Reading some comments you'd think Arsenal are a tiny financially-crippled family-run club who are just about staying afloat with limited resources. 

In reality they are a fucking massive club who are now more or less free of the debt from their world class stadium that was built largely due to successes achieved by their world class manager. Yet we're supposed to believe they're OVERACHIEVING every season they win the top 4 trophy? Because they're at the top of the ""class"" table ? Because their net transfer expenditure is positive?  

I mean I'm American and I don't even consider myself a massive hater of Arsenal because I think it'd be a bit disingenuous to pretend the rivalry is in my blood. But even I get fucking infuriated by all the rationalizing that goes on with this topic.

I'm not. I've watched the progress towards a Scottish Independence referendum that credibly started in the 1970's. These things take time. A movement needs to be able to point to constant support over a number of years (booms and busts) and to have posed a credible alternative to the status quo. It takes of a lot of dedication and work. 

The UKnotInTheEU group does not have this and as such it is very unrealistic a referendum will happen just because there is some peak in the polls. What they should be doing at this point is preparing evidence of what a life out of the EU could look like  (Replace the ECHR will a UK Bill of Rights? Ok, what would that look like? Enter trade agreements with BRIC countries? Ok, what are the doing at the moment and how could the UK join in?).

They might even be better going down the gradualist route.

With appeals it seems to me that the FA's chief motivation is to uphold the authority of the referees (which is a stance I do agree with on the whole), because they will generally uphold any decision the ref makes as long the ref feels that he saw what happened.

Clearly Mike Dean didn't have the perfect angle, but he saw the incident and made a decision.  Players already act as though the referee's  authority is less than absolute, and the FA strike me as being very reluctant to shift the perception of power away from the ref if they can avoid it.  That means that some bad decisions will be upheld, but for the right reasons.

On the other hand the FA doesn't seem too keen dish out frivolous appeal punishments either.  They seem to do it mostly when it looks like a team is gaming the system to get a player's ban suspended until after an important match.
