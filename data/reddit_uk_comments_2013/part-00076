true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"Oh I absolutely agree that it's extremely difficult to set a precise agenda for education. To a large extent it's an almost archetypal victim of politics: it's close to impossible to get objective, long-term prospective data. It's also a chronically and consistently underfunded function IMO, which means there are constant budget trade-offs.

One crucial such trade-off is, as you put it, 'one size fits all' social benefit vs personal aspiration. The more money and time spent on one, the fewer resources for the other. Both are clearly quite subjective and difficult to codify. In my view, it is not - in most cases - a very good use to ask a bunch of children what their aspirations are and help them achieve it, for the simple reasons that kids either have no real idea what they will want to do in 5 years time or what will benefit them in the long run. The best examples are maths and english: a lot of kids find them extremely tedious, but they're by far the most important skills for the vast majority of careers.

There is a huge value judgement in determining what will benefit society, but it's a value judgement made in pretty much every operation of government. I don't really see why we should shy away from it in education, where it has the greatest potential to individuals and society as a whole. The ideal would probably be a high degree of literacy and numeracy for all, a high proportion of STEM graduates, a smaller but exceptional pool of humanities students, and people who have *chosen* to pursue a vocation. It's impossible to say precisely what would be best, or to achieve it even if it were clear, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't do our best with the knowledge we have. IMO it's impossible not to impose any ideology - a liberal democracy is hugely ideological in itself - so we might as well impose one that teaches important skills, and the ability to critically analyse information and reject that which you disagree with.

Our current system is far from perfect, but it's in the right ballpark and the most sensible approach is to try to make beneficial adjustments to it. On the basis, I think more hours of school could well be a step in the right direction - certainly, I think you'd struggle to say that the problem with our youth today is too much school.",0,1366331428,null,0,false,0,c9i41ot,t3_1cm2sx,t1_c9i41ot,t1_c9i2xyl,null,1431507202,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

And it's bordering on impossible to find the middle ground, which while I very much agree with J.S. Mill's views on related subjects, my main criticism is that finding a perfect balance is far too idealistic. 

I also agree when you say that asking children what they want to be is an utter waste of time. Education, no matter what, should strive to give students the core skills and ideas, which then give them the personal freedom to pursue their own creative goals as they develop. Your suggestion that intellectual discourse is important is something I also strongly hold with. However, having only finished secondary (state) education in 2011, I can say that I never experienced anything remotely like free discussion, and is only scantily appearing at A-level. What concerns me, when considering Mr Gove's wider changes to the curriculum, is that this may be further eroded from our education system. I stand by my point that no amount of increased contact time can possibly improve learning, if the very subject matter is inherently faulty and restrictive.

It is impossible not to have an ideology, in anything really! I was only pondering on what it means to provide a near non-biased education, and I'm glad that you responded as you did.

I think that there certainly are improvements that need to be made, as with many public services in the UK. But I think caution and patience is required, and as we both have agreed, far more research-based policy. Pilot schemes, consultations, and further debate is what is needed.

That's one of the great things about the show. They took risks in a way similar to Dennis the Pennis and Sacha Baron Cohen. That kind of comedy isn't easy to pull off.

Series 1:

* Father's Day - Peter Tyler's sacrifice was just really well done
* Bad Wolf/The Parting of Ways - Mind blowing at the time, lots of sacrifice done correctly

Series 2:

* New Earth - They just did a great job with Cassandra's character
* The Girl in the Fireplace - Great insight into the Doctor's character with him being her lonely angel, and demonstrates the follys of time travel
* The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit - Creating an amazing feeling of hopelessness when the Tardis is lost and they're stuck helpless on a planetoid revolving around a black hole with an evil Satan demon

Series 3:

* Gridlock - Face of Boe's sacrifice to save a dystopic world
* Blink - Terrifying. Absolutely terrifying.
* Utopia - I just loved the way they showed humans surviving at the end of time, and the way they began placing their hope in a fantasy Utopian society when everything else was gone. Very well done

Series 4:

* Partners in Crime - Great banter between Ten and Donna, seeing her out trying to improve herself after they first met, Wilfred looking at the stars and seeing Donna out flying up there.
* The Fires of Pompeii - mostly for Donna's bit at the end
* Planet of the Ood - Donna going from finding the Ood creepy to crying over them was great
* The Unicorn and the Wasp - Seeing Agatha Christie be remembered at the end
* Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead - River's intro/death, Miss Evangelista
* Turn Left - Donna was just all around great here, especially that moment when Rose takes away her hope and she's forced to sacrifice herself
* The Stolen Earth/Journey's End - Too much to name, imo the best season finale. Harriet Jones is a BAMF

Series 5:

* Vincent and the Doctor - Vincent seeing his work immortalized was just overpowering
* The Lodger - Craig being awesome

Series 6:

* The Doctor's Wife - Getting to hear the ""Tardis"" speak
* A Good Man Goes to War - Action and drama
* Let's Kill Hitler - River's origins established and her sacrifice for the Doctor
* The Girl Who Waited - Old Amy, nuff said
* The God Complex - Great exploration of faith

Series 7:

* Asylum of the Daleks - Clara Dalek was exceptional
* The Angels Take Manhattan - BAWWWWWW
* The Snowmen - Clara's buildup as a character and death

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"&gt; why not make your shape shifters the Zygons?

Don't recall when Doctor Who has ever had shape-shifters. The closest things would be the Autons, the Slitheen, and (this is likely the closest) the Tesselecta. 

And you may not want to use the Zygons because, let's be frank, the Zygons look a bit silly. They're just tentacle heads. Not very menacing.

&gt; Why the Ood and not the Sensorites?

Because of their thematic differences. One's being used in a very different way from the Sensorites. I mean, don't get me wrong, there are clear parallels, but there are enough differences (particularly in their translation ball, which greatly adds to their look) to make a new species worthwhile.

&gt; The Minotaur in ""The God Complex"" is a cousin of the Nimon. Well... Why not use the Nimon?

Because they wanted a more clearly minotaur look. And additionally the Minotaur had many different powers that the Nimon didn't have. This creature fed off emotional energy and all that nonsense.

Overall Doctor Who's supposed to illustrate this big, complicated universe. To show him bumping into the same species over and over and over again makes the place seem way too small.

&gt;  The Minotaur in ""The God Complex"" feeds off Faith, now how is that supposed to work [...] And ""The Rings Of Akhaten."" The temple works with psychic connections?

You have to remember that this is Doctor Who. the idea of emotions having universal power is pretty potent throughout its run, most prominently in Troughton's era (they had a land of fiction. A land of *imaginary things existing in a reality*).

&gt; ""Fathers Day"" firmly established and made the point, that touching your younger self created a paradox unleashing the Reapers.

And Father's Day is a contradiction of the established canon of the Blinovich Limitation Effect. Time isn't a concrete thing, it's different all throughout. Some points are fixed, some aren't. At some points in time touching yourself causes a paradox, at other times it doesn't.

And besides, it didn't say that the Reapers would come *every* time there was a paradox, only that they were attracted to this one particular paradox. It's like how if you get cut you risk infection but not all cuts will get infected.

I love that about him. But the problem is is that we never really get to see that side of him except in short quips and bits.

I firmly believe the problem rests in Moffat. The guy's great, don't get me wrong. I mean, have you seen Sherlock? It's brilliant! The episodes he wrote during Davies' tenure? Amazing! Blink and Silence of the Library/Forest of the Dead are some of my all-time favorite episodes. Season 5 of Doctor Who was great. I mean, there were some episodes that weren't too good. But overall it was okay. But I think as the show went on, Moffat kind of didn't focus so much on what was important anymore. And that makes me mad.

true,brilliance,tardis,TARDIS,"It's not a great episode, and has some truly awful aspects, but it's also an interesting one.  It tries out the Doctor-lite formula before Blink gave us a marvelous example of how good Doctor-lite could get.  Unfortunately, the monster of the week was one of those truly awful aspects I mentioned before.  It's dumb and gross and deserving of all the hate and scorn it gets.  And certain aspects of the ending are just creepy in a bad way.

But it had some redeeming aspects to it as well.  I for one liked Elton a lot.  He's the main protagonist, as well as narrator via video recordings on his computer.  His mysterious past with that image of the Doctor looming large at its center was compelling enough.  Plus, seeing the events of the various alien incursions of the previous season and a half from a civilian's point of view was cool.

I also really liked the idea of a group of people affected by the Doctor getting together and then growing into a de facto family.  In a version of the story where the Doctor could have seen them during their glory days, I bet he would have loved it.

Essentially, I think I like the episode because it's full of potential for being something pretty special, but with some terrible decisions that were made.  Again, it cannot be stated enough how bad that monster was.

The merest thought of that scenario was enough to make me wander around with chalk in my pockets. Y'know. Just in case they moved or something.

The odd thing is that the majority of alleged ""horror"" movies bore the crap out of me. Once I identify the tropes involved, I'll just kinda faze off into whatever else is happening around me and wait until the music has a crescendo before paying attention again. Only when a movie has enough of an ""Ooooooooh what the hell is *that*!"" sense to it can I truly drop my suspension of disbelief. Like the Saw series, for example. It wasn't a super- (or pretur-, you ""use proper language"" freaks!) -natural occurence. It was, instead, an intelligent person with absolutely zero fucks to give about societal norms. (I'm abbreviating and summarizing. Sue me.) And that is the kind of person that would scare me to death three times a day, six on Sundays.

But the problem with the Angels for me was... There was no real trope about them before they came about. Metal, yes. Terracotta, yes. Clay, yes. Plaster, always. But not solid stone. (Which, of course, makes me wonder how the hell they turned the Statue of Liberty into an Angel... Yet another problem I have with TATM, I suppose. I'll just add it to the pile.)

The gist of it is that the US allowed an IRA leader to raise money in the US in the 90s after the IRA declared a cease-fire.  Bill Clinton made the decision and said he did it to encourage the IRA to turn to politics instead of terror and to gain leverage with the organization for the purpose of encouraging it to engage in talks with Britain.  The article implies that such fundraising was not legal before this event.

Source: http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/10/world/clinton-to-permit-fund-raising-in-the-us-by-top-ira-figure.html

""Brushing aside strong objections from the British Government, President Clinton has decided to permit Gerry Adams, the political leader of the Irish Republican Army, to make his first money-raising tour of the United States, the White House said today.

...

Until last year, the United States maintained a generation-long ban on official contacts with Sinn Fein, which it had condemned as a terrorist organization for condoning decades of bombings, assassinations and other violence by the I.R.A. Mr. Clinton ended that blanket prohibition after the I.R.A. declared a cease-fire in Northern Ireland last September, but until today he had deferred to British sensitivities by barring Mr. Adams from raising money here.

The President has now lifted that final barrier, aides said, because he felt that Sinn Fein was living up to its commitment to seek peace by peaceful means. Today Mr. Adams sent a statement to the White House saying his party would discuss disarmament with British ministers. [ Page A12. ]

The aides said Mr. Clinton also believed that the United States might gain some leverage with the Sinn Fein that could help to open the way to direct talks between Sinn Fein and the British Government.""",0,1366354154,null,0,false,0,c9ic14a,t3_1ck5cd,t1_c9ic14a,t1_c9hoo1n,null,1431503368,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,lawschoolzombie,null,null,"I'm thoroughly for Pellegrini for a couple of reasons:

1. Resourceful: Pellegrini managed to do well with both Villareal and Malaga. Infact, he wasn't too bad at Santiago either. His ability to bring the best out of otherwise disposed players is a real doozer. I specifically remember a Villareal squad that was gorgeous to watch play with one of my favourite players of all time - Juan Roman Riquelme, and let's not forget that squad included a young Cazorla, an old Pires, a yet to be recognized Diego Lopez, the already proven (then) Nihat Kahveci, Joan Capdevila, the ever diving Jose Mari (who was decent) and the largely underappreciated Bruno. 

So this is a man who clearly knows who's good.

2) Understated: Guys, I know we love The Special One for his special-one-ness, but our club has been at the epic center of shit storms for almost the last decade now. We need to find someone who can keep the talk on the field. Who will not bait the English media and who'll let us focus on our football...for once.

3) Spanish connection: Although The Engineer hasn't really worked majorly with any member of our squad (save for Piazon this year), his spanish/Chilean affiliation means that he will be able to easily communicate with the Spanish and Brazillian contingent. His (supposed) ability to talk English means he'll be able to do his job with the English/other languages guys. 

4) High pressure owners: Phil Lythell points this out in his blog that Pellegrini has worked under the Real Madrid 'soccer-franco' Florentina Perez. That means he may have an inkling (not saying ability) of how to work with Roman. 


Guys, I hope this works over Mourinho. And that we don't fire him in a season... or two....or three. It would be awesome. Like a.w.e.s.o.m.e.",0,1366354919,null,0,false,0,c9ic8i7,t3_1cll03,t1_c9ic8i7,t3_1cll03,null,1431503271,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

The double pivot is meant to mean that one play will break up the play whilst the other focuses on distribution of the ball. Seeing as both Mikel and Ramires are as equally shit at passing said ball, they have to share both of these responsibilities. 

But, this is how Spain plays (Busquets and Alonso) and how Germany plays (Khedira and Schweinsteiger). There are teams like Ururguay who will play two built-like-brick-shithouses-who-want-to-ruin-people's-days, but one will be more advanced than the other......


So you can look at it being sort of like the ball moving to one player who will pivot to another and then the other will pivot into attack and the same in reverse.

I think the tight gun control we have in this country is far more helpful to society than what you have in the US. A gun is an impersonal and dangerous weapon that is next to impossible to defend against. If somebody were to attempt to mug me with a knife, it's possible that I would be able to run away to avoid injury, and if I was caught I might be able to defend myself physically or at least direct blows to areas like my hands and arms which are less likely to kill me. While I would still feel threatened, I would not feel completely defenseless. I cannot defend myself against an assailant with a gun; even if I had one too, all I can do is attack them back. I feel much safer on the streets in the UK.

In the US, law enforcement carry guns, and, in a society where criminal gun ownership is so high, I can absolutely see why. But again, it doesn't make me feel any safer. If anything, it makes me feel more threatened because I can see how badly a situation can potentially escalate, and how easy it would be for an innocent bystander like me to become collateral damage. I also do not understand why so many airport personnel are armed, particularly on airside after all passengers have just passed rigorous security screening. Even the question of arming people like teachers is utterly ludicrous and would make me fear *more* for my child, not less. A classroom is not a place for a lethal weapon, no matter who is wielding it. 

Somebody being shot in the UK, whether they survive or not, is news, and that's the way it should be. Somebody with a source can feel free to correct me if I'm wrong (or back me up if I'm right, I'm sure OP would be interest either way), but AFAIK, while violent crime in the UK is higher, we have a lower murder rate in the UK, and I think tight gun laws are a significant contributing factor to that. 

Some American's reverence of guns and the right to carry them makes me very nervous indeed. I don't think it's healthy for any group of people to be so attached to a deadly weapon. As I understand it, the idea, ultimately, is to be able to defend yourselves against government tyranny, but a) that's far from how they are actually being used and treated, and b) what exactly are you going to do with one handgun when the secret police come knocking?

2) It helps society overall, at least our society. I've never seen a gun which can only be a good thing.

3) Violent crime in UK statistics includes all kinds of assault, which can be as minor as slapping somebody. (Compare this to the US, where violent crime only includes grevious bodily harm and up, or France where there has to be some sort of injury). So we're pretty good at recording it. We do have a problem with this kind of behaviour though, which I think comes down to our drinking 'culture'. There'll often be a scuffle of some sort outside a city centre pub or bar. As a country we don't really know how to handle our drink.

4) The UK Police operate something called 'Policing by Consent'.

If someone bigger and faster than you (me) wanted to hurt you, there isn't a lot you could do about it, which terrifies me. If someone pulled a knife on me and wanted to hurt me, there is nothing I can do about it. Call the police? At best they'll be ten minutes, can't legally own anything for the purpose of defending myself, can't carry a knife on me, can't have any non-lethal defence systems apart from a glorified whistle.

If they allowed people to carry a concealed weapon over here, a lot of murder/rape/general crime would be prevented. My uncle legally owns several rifles and shotguns, he is a responsible gun owner and person in general, he should legally be allowed to own a handgun for self defence and carry it upon his person.

Then don't give them a gun license? That's why we have gun licenses after all, they don't just hand out shotguns and rifles you know :P

&gt;My personal thoughts and opinions are just as valid as yours; 

You're entitled to your opinion, it just happens to be wrong. If I ever have kids, especially a daughter, I'd want to know that she could protect herself if anything ever goes wrong. 

I know of a friend of the family, her daughter (16) and a friend (15) were recently jumped by a gang of cowardly dickheads who stabbed and slashed them and tried raping them, the kicker is the mother of the 16 y/o stood there paralyzed with fear watching, luckily a passer by had the nouse to kick the fuck out of one of the scrotes and the rest legged it.

If anything ever happened like that to my own flesh and blood and I wasn't around to stop it, I think I'd literally go insane.

tl;dr main point. **Criminals can get weapons, if I wanted a gun I could quite easily buy myself a handgun for about £500 with about 20 rounds. If I wanted a machete, I'll go to an agricultural store or amazon, if I wanted a tazer, I could get one. It is readily available. And I could carry it around with my as I saw fit**

But if I wanted to get a weapon of some sort, to defend myself, legally. No chance. See the flaw in the system? Law abiding citizens such as ourselves are being punished by the law, we can't defend ourselves against people who want to hurt us.

A very large percentage of the population work away from home - but cant vote where they spend the bulk of their waking hours. They also go home via shopping centres or transport hubs, but cant vote there.

Yes, in theory, we should all be willing to take a bit of time out of our day to detour to some never otherwise visited community centre... but if the goal is purely to increase voter turnout, then convenience could be all it needs to turn the ""want to vote, but forgot/lazy"" into actual voters.

It would not be hugely difficult to allow a person to vote remotely -- it is after all just a variant on postal voting.

Each ballot card given a digital identity that can be used to purely to ensure that each person votes just once (with the voting intention never ever stored). Vote using a touchscreen, which then prints out a paper receipt.

Collate the numbers at a nanosecond after 10pm to give an instant result... but then that verdict is later validated by random paper counts of local voters to verify the digital result matches the paper one.

Lots to work out in the detail -- but goodness sake, we should be long past going to a specific venue and scratching an x on a sheet of paper with a pencil stub.

The cracks in the universe and the Pandorica that were the crux of the season 5 finale were foreshadowed all throughout the season, we were shown ominous shots of cracks and multiple side characters referred to/warned the Doctor about the cracks,the Pandorica, and even the Silence, which provided foreshadowing for the overarching theme of Season 6 and presumably the 50th anniversary.

We've been getting consistent build up ever since River was introduced in Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead about her mystery which is intertwined with that of the Silence. RTD's story arcs rarely went past a single season, and were sometimes only Easter eggs in the background of the episode. Moffat's, on the other hand, are building up on an epic scale that was only really matched by RTD at the end of his time, where he brought all of the departed characters back and gave them a role in the climax. Moffat is attempting something bigger - he's planting those roles steadily as he goes along, answering some questions and leaving others to be revealed later (the Doctor noting that they still don't know what caused the TARDIS to explode, the motivations of the Silence etc). We'll be able to look back on his big episodes - the premieres, the end/mid season finales - as something bigger than movie length at the end of his time, because they're all regarding the same overarching plot as opposed to individual problems, which RTD's seasons dealt with. 

Also... ""too much focus on the companions""? The show is just as much about the companions as about the Doctor. If you look at what became of RTD's companions (Rose controlled all of time and space briefly, and Donna was referred to the most important woman in the universe), you'll see that they're an extremely important part of what makes the show constantly new, refreshing, and loveable. 

To be honest I'm kind of over the generalisations and elitism that people are parading around with regarding what Moffat's done. He's a brilliant writer and it's kind of depressing that the fan base is so cynical about his work.

1) The usual stuff but I'd say it's mostly burglary and minor crimes committed by youths with nothing better to do. 

2) I personally don't think it should be legal to carry a weapon. The only people I think should have a gun are those who use it for recreational purposes, e.g. hunting (although that's another debate in itself). There is an argument to say that criminals are still going to be able to get a hold of them, but I'd counter that by saying that if it was legal there would be more people who had them and therefore more people who might shoot somebody, whereas if it was illegal they would have used a knife or just that in the heat of the moment they wouldn't be able to reach a gun. I feel much safer on the streets of the UK than the US knowing that there's a smaller proportion of people carrying guns.

3) Assuming that your figures are correct and the crimes recorded are comparable I'd say it's because there's less integration with different ethnic groups in the UK. I don't know much about this question though so I'll let someone else answer it better! 

4) Most people like the police. We can have a chat with them and see them as humans. The idea with our police force has always been that they are part of the community. Obviously if you're prone to committing crimes then you might not see them as so friendly! There's a tv programme called the Lock Up which shows a police station in Hull.

true,mypetocean,rose,Rose,"It's important to remember that ""Silence must fall."" isn't the prophecy -- that is, it isn't certain that silence *shall indeed* fall. ""Silence must fall"" is the goal of The Silence organization -- whether it happens or not.

The prophecy is: ""On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the eleventh, when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, a Question will be asked..."" -- and then follows not a prophecy, but a judgment call someone has made in response to the prophetic element -- ""...a question that must never, ever be answered.""

This is why they tried to make the Doctor's death a fixed point in time: to ensure that the question will never be answered.

A bad (or at least unethical) organization wants to prevent the Doctor from answering the Question, which would make us think that answering it *might* be a good thing -- except that the Doctor is keeping it a secret for a reason. So whatever it is, *the Doctor views answering it as bad AND the Silence views answering it as bad.*

In any case, it could hardly be that someone who wants to *unlock* the Moment (i.e., release the Time Lords) is behind the Silence. If the answer to the Question is the key to unlocking the Moment, then whoever would want that to happen would *want* the Doctor to answer the Question -- not prevent it. So if indeed the Answer is the key to unlocking the Moment, the architect(s) of the Silence desperately want(s) to keep Gallifrey under lock and key.

If indeed the Doctor's name is the Answer, and that name is the key to unlock the Moment, then the Doctor may now, at this moment in his timeline, know that he is hurtling headlong into the *inevitability* of the Time Lords' release (unless he dies). By dodging the Silence's attempt at assassinating him (and dodging other fatal events last season and this season), he knew he was hastening the possible fulfillment of the prophecy -- which is something he apparently does not want to happen.

&gt;Asked if he will consider raiding the club who sacked him last month after three years in charge, McDermott said: “Not necessarily. If we’re talking about Reading players, not necessarily.

&gt;“Is there a possibility of that? There could be. But I wouldn’t say I’m going to sign six players from Reading. It won’t happen.

This is a very smart move by him in my opinion, for a few reasons. One is that it won't cause a schism between the side (if that has even happened before) where the Reading players may or may seem to be treated better than the Leeds old boys, it may cause a moral drop when a manager plays his favourite players and omits key ones just because he likes them (Where have we seen that before)? And another thing is that this reinforces McDermott's confidence in the squad, saying that they are a great bunch, and that he can do a very good job with them, with maybe a few additions (which is obvious). This again would be good for morale.

On the other hand though, Reading does have some good players who would of benefit to us and the style McDermott will impose, and since they are pretty much relegated already, I'm sure not many of them will have qualms about jumping ship, since they are only moving parallel.

**PFA defends Luis Suárez's place on Player of the Year shortlist**

The Professional Footballers' Association chief executive, Gordon Taylor, has defended the presence of Luis Suárez on the six-man shortlist for the union's prestigious Player of the Year award.

Suárez's main rivals for the award are Gareth Bale, who has also been nominated in the Young Player category, and Robin van Persie, who won it last season before leaving Arsenal for Manchester United.

In a shortlist that includes no defenders or goalkeepers, and no representation from the champions Manchester City, the biggest surprise is the absence of Swansea forward Michu, whom many believe to be the signing of the season. Instead, the Chelsea duo Juan Mata and Eden Hazard are included, in addition to Manchester United's unsung hero Michael Carrick who, at 31, finally gets his first nomination. The six players are shortlisted on the basis of votes cast by their fellow professionals.

There is no doubt Suárez has been one of the most effective players in the Premier League this year. However, his reputation has been damaged by the eight-match ban he received for racially abusing Patrice Evra at Anfield last season.

Given his blatant handball also denied Ghana an appearance in the 2010 World Cup semi-finals and the periodic allegations of diving, some would argue he hardly deserves to be acknowledged by his peers.

But Taylor, while accepting Suárez will always be a controversial figure, feels the Uruguayan's on-pitch performances, including 29 goals, for Liverpool this term, make him worthy of inclusion.

""Sometimes controversy travels with players,"" said Taylor. ""Sometimes it is in their very nature. Sometimes it is that very intensity that causes a problem also makes sure they win.

""Luis Suárez is helping to restore Liverpool. It is a credit to them that he seems comfortable there and no one could deny he is one of the finest players in the world.""

Yet no one could deny either that if Suárez wins the award when it is announced on 28 April, it will put the PFA in an uncomfortable position given his background.

""It is very difficult at times,"" said Taylor. ""Players are expected to be top role models and set the finest example. That goes with the trade these days.

""I don't underestimate the need for them to do all they can to be seen as a good example. But they are also human beings. It is not always possible to put old heads on relatively young shoulders.

""This is a footballing award and Suárez's footballing ability shines through.

""It would be naive to think controversy won't continue to travel with him. But I think his football has maintained his place.""

Like Bale, Hazard has also been listed for the Young Player prize, where he faces competition from Christian Benteke, Romelu Lukaku, Danny Welbeck and Jack Wilshere. Welbeck, Wilshere and Carrick are the only English players out of the 12 men nominated.

For the first time, there will be a Women's Player of the Year prize too, with Scotland's Kim Little amongst those nominated in addition to her 20-year-old Arsenal team-mate Jordan Nobbs, who scored a stunning debut goal against Italy in England's triumphant Cyprus Cup campaign in March.

true,TheForeignMan,null,null,"&gt; Every economist I speak to says whenever you start printing money, your just kicking the can down the road for the next generation to pay for.

Every economist you speak to is either incredibly bad at economics, or you have just misunderstood what they were telling you. Increasing the supply of money in the economy can be a useful tool to counteract deflation. This is exactly what Japan are doing (and have been doing for a while now).  

Also, the IMF is not suggesting monetary stimulus (which is what the Bank of England are actually doing right now), but fiscal stimulus, which is completely different.  
Fiscal stimulus is government spending. The hope when governments do this is that the multiplier effect will be enough to improve output by more than it will cost them for the spending. The argument for fiscal contraction (austerity) is that the multiplier effect won't be big enough and it will cost us more in the long-run. This is what the government is arguing at the moment and what the IMF disagree with.  

&gt; I've been going to the philippines quite a bit, when I first went there 7 years ago you got 110pesos to the pound. Now it's 63, if we carry on printing money it will be 30 in 5 years. This is slightly off subject, but rather being political on this everyone should think about the overall outcome for the country.

This is neither positive nor negative. You just care because you can't get as much as you could for your money now compared to 7 years ago. If you think about 'the overall outcome for the country' you'd realise that actually having a weaker currency is good for the balance of trade, and will cause output to increase.  
Of course, this would me imports get more expensive, but this is good news for your town's teenager, as soon it will not be as profitable for Filipino nail ladies to come over, so we'll see a decrease in them. 

In another reply I see you said: 

&gt;There also seems to be double speak when it comes to the west we call it fiscal stimulus, when we talk about Zimbabwe etc we call it printing money.

This is not double speak, the two scenarios are completely different.  
To be honest, when you're getting basic economic concepts like this mixed up it's clear you don't know what you're on about. I recommend you either go out and learn about it, or just hush up next time. ",0,1366371928,null,0,false,0,c9iekiq,t3_1cnxjg,t1_c9iekiq,t1_c9idfe7,null,1431502172,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

true,GhoolsFold,null,null,"My two cents for you :)

1) I can't give you stats but from my personal experience robbery (house and mugging) and random street violence are the ones I've seen and heard of most.

2) in my opinion our tight gun laws are absolutely, unquestionably good for our society.  They prevent escalation of confrontation.  Most shootings that do happen are within the criminal community.  Most people I know have never seen a gun in this country outside of a shooting club.  There's just no need for anyone to carry a gun on the street, they're only for one thing and that's to damage people.  I have never ever been in or heard of a situation that would have been improved by guns being present.  I believe *most* people would agree with me here.

3) obviosuly difficult to pin down but we have a high population density which causes friction.  We also have the most multicultural society which is a mixed blessing, again because of the friction.  There's a big drinking culture and people get *hammered* so no doubt a large proportion of violence happens when people have been drinking.  Culturally we also have a lot of confused frustration- Yeah!  We're GREAT Britain but I'm skint and it's raining so...

4) a lot of people I know apply the law to their actions rather practically, ie is it immoral/will I get caught rather than is it illegal, especially for things like drugs or trespassing.  Police are a necessary evil and ours are pretty good, they never need bribing or anything like that (at least not at the lower levels!) and they're far less racist than they used to be.  Obviously the force attracts the bullied-in-school but most decent people I know will respect them and think they're alright.  Law enforcement generally people are frustrated at.  We think there is too much paperwork, weak sentences and I have never ever known someone who robbed a house to have been caught whereas I know loads of people who have been arrested for having small amounts of weed, for example.

Hope my opinions here help you.  However as always there's never anything that ""the citizens of the UK"" will ever all agree on, you will find many people who vehemently disagree with every word I've said.  I reckon it's pretty true for a lot, though.

&gt; I suppose an alternative could be the Canadian system, where the Government funds half the project and then puts a 50% tax rate on the company. 

I actually think this would be the best option. I have read the details of the proposed (and delayed) tax break and I think it can be interpreted as being somewhat restrictive. I can't find the original Westminster document but the tax break will only be given if the game passes a UK cultural test, that is, how British the game is [1].

The problem with the tax break in this form is how it will hurt smaller games studios, particularly those started by new graduates. My experience of the games industry, particularly in Scotland, is that most of games simply will not qualify for the tax exemption. Often these games are of a learning and educational nature, are aimed at a younger mobile-based market and tend to take place in fantasy worlds. In this case, the game scores 0 points on the UK cultural test. It is possible for the game to get points if it is developed in the UK and has British team members in qualifying positions but it doesn't give anywhere near enough points to ever qualify. The Canadian model is far less restrictive.

I actually know which government minister you're talking about and everyone I spoke to after that visit was more than just a little annoyed, they were frustrated because these are the people who decide what money goes where.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"It's entirely true - this is why in any economic situation, you can get 4 ""top economists"" and they can all give you completely different conclusions on what should be done in that situation. All 4 will claim the end result is growth, and more for everyone, and that not only is their way superior, but everyone else's way will lead to the opposite effects!

The *real* question I think is do politicians actually know this, and purposefully choose to listen to the people who encourage the course of action that they already want to take anyway for whatever reasons. Or are they actually just as lost as the rest of us and really have no clue what is best - and simply think their economist is talking the most sense?

Either way it clearly isn't a very scientific approach, as if it was there would be a lot more consensus and solid idea on the right course of action - countries often take similar stances on other problematic areas, but when it comes to economics you have 100 countries all taking off in 100 different directions.

Maybe it's all just too complex for anyone to understand - but as you say, real scientific research should be able to shed some light on this.

But then we have one country with austerity that is successful, and another that isn't. Then we have another country that does the opposite and fails - while yet another doesn't!

1) Alcohol fuelled violence is fairly rife in my experience, but I am a doorman in a city centre drinking establishment so I see a lot more of it than most people. Burglary and theft are probably more common though, especially shop lifting and the like.

2) I would hate to live in a country with laxer gun laws, at the moment almost no one I meet will have access to a gun. If someone is upset by me, to obtain a gun would require a considerable ammount of effort and more importantly provide a cooling off period where they may change their mind about doing something stupid. Someone with instant access to a gun is more likely to do something stupid in the heat of the moment that they wouldn't otherwise do.

3) Our attitude to drinking may be part of the cause to this. We have the idea that you get drunk, your inhibitions lower and you do stupid things or get violent. On the continent they believe that alcohol makes you happy and so they don't behave in the same way that many people do in our town centres. Because we believe alchol makes us do things like get into fights or have sex with someone we've only just met, then that's the way we behave.

Anything that increased the number of people walking around with weapons increases the level of violence possible around those people, regardless of their initial intentions.

Most people would be pretty useless with any kind of weapon, be it screwdriver or gun, and are more likely to do themselves harm, or have it wrestled away from them in a confrontation, than use if effectively for self defence.

I'm not underestimating the danger of a knife however I do want to point out the fundamental difference between a gun and a knife.  A knife you have to *push into a person* to do them damage as opposed to just pull a trigger.  That's a major psychological difference which affects how likely someone is to use a weapon.

After graduating in 1992, Osborne did a few part-time jobs including as a data entry clerk, typing the details of recently deceased into a NHS computer database.[13] He also briefly worked for a week at Selfridges, mainly re-folding towels.[13]

That's right, the man who runs the whole countries finances has no economic education.

Economics is about trying to make models that 'fit' the world, the models by definition are going to be wrong, they are an approximation to something, you can't, well with present technology, model every human mind, every natural event to figure out precisely what is going to happen.

Even something as mundane as Supply and Demand is really, really hard to model for some things, example; as the more demand happens, the more the supply can be improved due to the increased money, buying an expensive machine to improve production.  Sometimes this makes things become cheaper the more who buy them.

You need to understand that the whole point of the RES tags I make is so that I don't waste time on clowns who don't listen to other people's opinions (or to facts, for that matter).

I'm being very patient with you right now - I'll spend 5 or 10 minutes on this reply, but please understand that I'm very unlikely ever again to waste 30 or 60 minutes composing a well-considered and thoughtful explanation for you, because you've shown in the past that you don't appreciate it. You're disrespectful of others and you don't deserve my consideration. 

Right now, I consider that I'm doing you a favour - the only way you can progress this discussion is by accepting you've been a muppet and by trying to change and improve yourself.

I don't give a fuck about your insults, because you're pretty much beneath my contempt. 

I'm sorry about that, but it's your own words that have led to your ""pariah status"". Judging from the voting on these comments I'm not alone in my opinion of you.

I'm not sure that I can be slandering *or* libelling you - I'm just reporting your own words (and that is absolutely *not* a ""personal attack"") and it's you yourself who deleted the evidence. I mean, get a court order and have Reddit turn over copies of your deleted comments, if they still hold copies, but I'm pretty sure they'll support what I say. 

It's not a ""personal attack"" to quote your own words. I make a point of pride that I'll stand by any comment I make, or apologise for it. Whatever reason you claim, when you delete your own comments, the long ones in controversial discussions, then you look like a coward.

I don't give a toss what you think about Nick Clegg. The stuff about UKIP - you're allowed to be politically uneducated, but if that's all it was I'd probably discuss it with you. You've proven, with repeated comments in this subreddit, that you're not prepared to listen to other people. 

It's not enough to say ""I'm not homophobic"" - those words aren't magic. Just saying them doesn't make you not homophobic, and it's not useful to judge your LGBT tolerance merely on the basis that you've never gone out at weekends looking for gays to beat up. 

So, yeah, your repeated use of the word faggot as an insult, that's fucking homophobic, dude. I see you've deleted that now, so I can't link you. Please don't give me any stuff about how the word means something different now. 

You literally used ""you virgin loser"" as an insult in the ""I am a redditor who lost his virginity"" thread. It doesn't matte the context of this comment (which we can't prove, anyway, because you've deleted it), it's disgusting to shame or insult someone over sex. I've also seen you use the word ""retarded"" as an insult.

One of your comments in aforementioned thread was to state that if you knew someone who was still a virgin at a certain age then you ""might think they were a gay boy or something"". I can't quote you word for word, because that's one of the deleted comments I linked to already. I recall a distinctly patronising air to the way you referred to homosexuality in that comment. You may not have used the word ""poofter"", but the way you used ""gay boy"" (or something like that) was memorably unpleasant. 

Not only that, but *it's still fucking homophobic* to make assumptions about someone maybe being gay because they're a virgin. Remember ""I'm not homophobic"" are not magic words - a nuanced understanding and constant self-evalation is essential in fighting discrimination. Making assumptions about people being gay - and publicly announcing your reasons - is divisive and gross. Whatever your intent, even if your best friend is gay, it's still a homophobic act to make such a statement. Even if you say ""I don't discriminate against gay people"", making such a statement is still a hostile act. 

Since this is pretty much the last word on /u/FakePlasticShrimp, I'll just throw in another comment I found in your history just now. Obviously I *had* to look in your history, to see what evidence you've not deleted. The sad thing about [your statement ""we need new council houses in white areas""](http://i.imgur.com/38NGTam.png) is that you're not ashamed of it - you haven't deleted it and you probably don't think it's racist.

If you want to rehabilitate yourself then I'm happy to engage with you. But otherwise I'm not going to waste my time on you. So that you know, I might reply to you again in future to take the piss out of you, and I might warn others about what an idiot you are, to save them wasting any time on you. That doesn't mean I'm going to indulge you or entertain you or reply to you with respect. As I say, you've shown (repeatedly) that you don't deserve that.

A lot of people can't even throw a decent punch, let alone keep hold of a weapon against an attacker when they're scared (and maybe a bit pissed, when they're more vulnerable than usual but yet, ironically, less able to manage their ""self defence"" weapon)

Well then I totally wouldn't trust my local police to decide who's allowed to carry a gun on the streets.  Sure, if someone's using one at the clay pigeon range and has it locked up at home the police can check whether they've got the appropriate safe etc, but that's a far cry from carrying one on the street and being free to use it on another human being when you feel threatened.  I don't think there could be any tests to determine someone's suitability for this sort of responsibility.  Even normally balanced people can get scared or paranoid.

Again NOT postulating!  To stab someone you have to a) be close to them and b) *push the knife into them*.  With a gun you have to do neither of these things.  They are both very dangerous, I appreciate that.  I don't think people should be allowed to carry knives for self defence either.  On the same proof level as your

I know that if you carry a knife you are more likely to get stabbed *by your own knife* than by anyone elses.

The entire conclusion isn't drawn from the error.

To quote from the paper:

&gt; Our main finding is that across both advanced countries and 
emerging markets, high debt/GDP levels (90 percent and above) are associated with notably 
lower growth outcomes. 

Which is a similar outcome to the one found by the researchers which found the mistake: 

[they find 0-30 debt/GDP , 4.2% growth; 30-60, 3.1 %; 60-90, 3.2%,; 90-120, 2.4% and over 120, 1.6%](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/04/16/reinhart-rogoff-response-to-critique/)

The correlation was much weaker than the one found by Reinhart and Rogoff, but it was still there.

&gt; And none of the reviewers bothered to even check the spreadsheet that was, presumably, attached to the paper.

They didn't include the spreadsheet, which I agree was a problem, but the paper was never published in a peer-reviewed journal. 

&gt; Yet their public statement is that they still ""feel"" they have enough evidence

Because their main finding is still more or less in tact and they include similar papers that show similar results, one of them done by themselves.

&gt; their state destroying conclusions.

Ok then, large amounts of debt = low economic growth is a state destroying conclusion. Besides this, the fact that their conclusions are state destroying are completely, 100% irrelevant. The conclusions are either true or false, political implications aren't supposed to matter for research. 

&gt; real sciences actually bother to replicate experiments and openly state inconsistencies in their field.

You are complaining that economists don't replicate experiments and state inconsistencies in their field and your evidence for this is a specific case in which economists replicated an experiment, found inconsistencies and promply stated them. Besides this, the research was replicated many times before with other datasets, with similar (but obviously not identical) results. This is evidence for (very) sloppy work, and it should probably cast into question the researchers' other papers, but that is it.

Even with what we had, the Americans considered our victory impossible. 

If Thatcher was expecting or encouraging the invasion, she was being stupid. Losing a war wouldn't win her an election, and that was the likely outcome of the conflict. We know from her handling of the mining unions that her government was quite capable of strategic planning. For them to have willfully planned a war we probably wouldn't win was very out of character.

Furthermore her government was happy to talk to and do deals with dictatorships, from the Soviet Union, to Chile, South Africa, and China. In the case of Argentina, they believed a peaceful settlement would be negotiated over the Falklands. Defending them was therefore unnecessary and offering the islanders citizenship politically difficult.

true,Apemazzle,null,null,"Should start by saying this is all about London:

1) Drugs, gangs, kids getting stabbed

2) Help - if all those kids stabbing each other all had guns, it would be worse. Gun incidents are rare.

3) Binge-drinking, gang culture, massively high unemployment in some places (not talking about London here, cheers Thatcher)

4) varies a lot. Lots of people (young people, minorities especially) are suspicious of police, big scandal recently(ish) in London of black people getting ""randomly"" stopped for searches. HUGE scandal about the manslaughter of some innocent guy during a protest a couple of years ago, which the officer was cleared of. There was a fucking video all over the internet of the policeman bashing this defenceless guy with a truncheon, utterly without provocation, and the guy ended up dying from the injury. There's the Jean Charles De Menezes scandal from a few years back as well. Also after the riots, lots of people were given preposterous maximum sentences for relatively minor crimes. That seemed really harsh. However lots of people think they do a great job, and we do have the IPCC I s'pose.

[Here's the Ian Tomlinson story](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jul/19/simon-harwood-not-guilty-ian-tomlinson). As you can see, it was controversial that the policeman was acquitted of manslaughter because another jury had ruled Tomlinson's death to have been unlawful.",0,1366385225,null,0,1366385852,0,c9ih683,t3_1cnd1t,t1_c9ih683,t3_1cnd1t,null,1431500945,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3
true,alexbfree,null,null,"1. Do NOT tell anyone at your workplace expect perhaps trusted colleagues that you are even looking, until you have a firm job offer. It may result in people treating you differently and it may make your remaining time there harder because ""you're leaving anyway""
2. Start your search for another job now. Try and fit in interviews outside of working hours. If that's not possible, you could claim a doctor's appointment or dentist or bank meeting (if your company lets people come late/leave early for that). If that's not possible, and you have vacation time left, take a half day vacation. If that's not possible, calling in sick is probably your best option. A white lie is better than just ""not showing up"". And certainly, don't miss an opportunity because of commitments to a job you hate. Remember, at this point you have very little to lose (assuming you are fairly employable).
3. Handing in notice: Yes, write it on paper, but I would say it's customary to give notice in person and hand over the letter at that time. I thought that for UK one month notice was the norm but maybe 2 weeks is ok. 
4. Your new employer will ask what date you are available. I would advise adding two weeks to whatever end date you will have with your old employer. Like you, I always like to engineer a gap. Be careful about telling your new employer your end date as they will want you to start right away. But if they do, you are in your rights to insist on a later date. If they want you, it's highly unlikely they'd refuse to delay your start date.
5. Depending on the nature of your job (e.g. if you have access to secrets or sensitive info that could be used by competitors against the company), you may find that once you give notice you are asked to leave immediately - you will paid as if working for the rest of your notice period, but not allowed to come to work. So make sure you are ready (for example, move all your personal files off work computers/laptops, etc). 
6. Finally, don't burn your bridges. If you are asked about why you are leaving, many people often prefer to talk about how they want new challenges, what you like about the new job, etc, rather than saying what you don't like about your old job. Otherwise you can get caught up in bitter discussions and going over old situations that are best left in the past. If you must criticize your old company, save it for after you've left, by letter, or for an exit interview with the HR department.

Above all, you don't need to worry because you are in control. Leaving a company gives you a lot of power (you can remind yourself ""what are you going to do? fire me? I'm leaving anyway). And starting at a new company also is a strong position because you know they want you.

The main thing is just don't tell them anything until you have a new job lined up. Unless you *really* trust your employer.

Production got underway at Shepperton on Friday 12th March 1965 for which the eight ""hero"" props were utilised together on set as effectively as possible.

The Daleks' livery was designed to take full advantage of the colour format of the motion picture and thus the paint schemes provide the obvious way to distinguish the first two props. As became traditional, a Black Dalek was leader, possessing a sucker-arm, and its neck rings and skirt hemis were painted an alternating gold and silver. This will be referred to as AARU One. The second-in-command was a Red Dalek with gold trim and black hemis, possessing a pincer claw, which is AARU Two. There was a unique ""specialist"" Dalek, plus five more standard ""drone"" props painted in identical two-tone blue with gold collars. We must look to more subtle differences to tell the drones apart apart.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;A model is a tool for explaining your data and its explanatory power is limited by the data

A spoon is a device for eating, it is only as good as your food.  Your food is limited by your spoon.  Sorry if that appears to be a bit straw man, but practical use of models is normally constrained by cost, as such the minimum amount of data that the model requires is the only one sourced.  Sometimes models can't be used because the data isn't feasibly available. 

All I was trying to do is remind people of a very poignant quote; models, by their design are broken, they are a simplification, so some things will be wrong.  Models such as Black Scholes are useful, despite having many broken features (stock movements are not lognormal).  So its a very broken model, but still useful.

&gt;There is no generic model for all supply and demand but you can model it. Fractals, for example, are a really good way of modelling it but they can't make predictions so economists don't seem to like them.

Which is halfway to my point, you're nokia producing a new phone the 920, it's going to be expensive, it's in a market that the firm is failing badly (high end phones).  How many do you make?

Saying ""oh well economists can't know"" isn't going to help, someone has to guess, isn't a best guess, even if its based on bad maths better than the alternative of no guesses?

I choose this example because they messed it up and failed to produce enough.

&gt;It seems to be based on a number of highly speculative principles that are based on philosophical grounding rather than any empirical data.

Mind me asking, are you in favour of no reduction or even stimulus?  Plenty of people have challenged both of those concepts before, plenty more have said it doesn't really matter what the government does, DPRK is a fascinating example of the free market growing in a heavily distorted market.

I am not an economist at all, I'm an engineer, I remember at 6th form reading a book on DC motor theory, sadly I can't find which one, but it was prefaced with something along the lines: ""this is all a bunch of lies, but without these lies, we would be even more lost"".

Why are you ripping on economists just because someone messed up an excel sheet, and no peer review found it?  It appears almost that the same vitriol you use to apply to the original paper, the rudeness you use to their academia, you then completely fail to apply to the new paper.

true,SweetboyRomero,null,null,"I handed my notice in two weeks ago yesterday, so I feel fairly well primed to help out here :D Basically everything wallyflops said is spot on, I just wanted to add a few things.

*Notice*

Your notice needs to be a written letter, but don't fret too much about the content. In fact just google 'notice letter template', get a stock one, change the details to fit. It's probably not going to be read by anyone, it's just a formality. 

I handed mine in as soon as I had my first offer (no contracts as yet) which was a bit silly as the new employer would have been well within their right to withdraw the offer. It all worked out fine but yeah, don't do that.

Standard notice period is a month so any new job will fully expect to wait at least this long. If you can get away earlier by using holiday, or if your contract states a shorter time than a month, then awesome. But yes, you won't have any problems by saying when you are available. I was going to recommend the little 'breathing space' in between, then saw you'd said it already, which is great. Just bear in mind that you won't be being paid by anyone for that week, so you might need to be careful with money for a month or so while you transition (money tends to be an issue around this time anyway what with cutoff dates for payroll etc)

*Interviews*

I was quite lucky with my interviews because when I was being contacted by the companies involved, I had the following week booked off anyway. It's a bit difficult to judge, as many companies will want to schedule the interview as soon as possible, while your current job might have some kind of minimum time in advance that you have to book time off. For example, I got asked to come by for a 2nd interview 'this time next week', but I have to give at least two weeks' notice for holiday.

If it's only one day, or even a half day if that's feasible, that might work out fine with your boss but don't be afraid to use a sick day if there's no other alternative. Just don't try and book time off, get it refused and then call in sick anyway, that's just begging for a disciplinary.

I feel like I smashed all 3 of my interviews (I got the first job, second one wanted me to go back for a second but I turned them down, they keep trying to get me to go back, and I didn't get the third one but that was a previous-experience issue rather than me) so hit me up if you want some tips on interview technique. I don't profess to be some kind of guru on the subject, but it obviously worked for me!

Good luck!

That is why there will never be a mainstream party of the left again - just as it is highly unlikely that there will ever be a mainstream party of the right either.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;Firstly, because the cost required to make a game is far outstripping the profits returned and, linking on to that, the market these products are aimed at is still too small. 

Then how the hell will reducing the tax on the profits help?  If the costs are far outstripping the profits I mean.  Most companies structure the financing costs below profits, by this I mean if someone thinks that the game will have only a 50/50 chance of breaking even, it is a separate legal entity which puts up the cash, normally a lot more than one.  This entity will charge for the risk.  That means that the risk fee because its a gamble, the market is small etc. is pre-tax, not post tax, for the games firm.

&gt;One mistake, one game that doesn't sell enough, and your company can be dust.

Right, so how will a tax break on profits help that?  The games company that posts only £100k profit, paying CT of 22k, won't servive?  But yet if its CT was only £0K it would?  Pfft.

Now for the obligatory: **what about me?**  My new little project I'm working on is costing about £3M, its a big gamble for the people whose money it is, why do games need help, but something which isn't entertainment not?  I mean this tool if it sells could create a lot of jobs.

&gt;Secondly, because the US and Canada do, and if we actually want these industries in the UK to be competitive, we bloody well need the cuts. Any games company of a decent size has a studio in Canada, due to the Governments' assistance.

So why not cut CT for everyone?  HK its flat rate of 15%, this is why a company I worked for, despite only having 40 people there (vs 50+ in LDN) was based as a HK firm.

If people are leaving in droves for lower CT, why is that unique to the games industry.  What about our competition to Ireland or Holland?

Brindley place this is where I spent my childhood, in a word it's nice. If you go you have to eat the Bank restaurant (a bit expensive BUT amazing sticky toffee pudding, although I'm not sure if they do it anymore), plus The Sea Life Centre is super close!

Also two more tourist destinations to consider are Cadbury World and the Botanical Gardens. Cadbury World is in Bourneville which is why they do a chocolate bar called that (spoilers!) and I guess you'd want to see what you Yanks took over! The Botanical Gardens are pretty interesting and have an AMAZING garden, this is another place from my childhood and I even donated a banana tree once which is doing quite well I hope.

Hope you have fun, this is an amazing place.

I'm assuming there will be a future for commuter rail and inter-city services on the West Coast Main Line once HS2 is built. Maybe by then we will see that we should have taken the opportunity to rebuild Euston...

I'm curious about how they plan to add all those extra platforms though.

As for New Street - the refurbishment and rebuild is about halfway through, apparently. The 'new' concourse will open within the next month or so and then the existing half of the station will be rebuilt. The new frontage and the John Lewis above the station will be the last part of the project to be revealed when it is completed in 2015. Apparently then the whole thing could be renamed ""Grand Central Birmingham"", at least according to the leaflet Network Rail were giving out when I was there the other week.

As for other stations in the country, the contrast between the main stations in Manchester is noticeable. Piccadilly has been rebuilt and feels light and airy. Victoria is like New Street - dark, dingy, a sense of faded glory about the place.

Hopefully it will be rebuilt as part of the [Northern Hub](http://www.networkrail.co.uk/improvements/northern-hub/) project.

Firstly, as has been covered off, COA's can mean nothing. Not an issue if you are paying a small amount - but very important when you may be paying hundreds or thousands.

Secondly, there is a difference between what players wear and what is sold to the masses - look for the term ""match worn shirt"" to understand the difference. To be fair, this item is not advertised as such, but the difference financially between a replica item from the megastore, signed by even the full squad, and a shirt worn on *that* night will be multiple thousands.

With a match worn shirt you are looking for, or are provided with photographic evidence which matches the shirt you have with what was worn in a specific match - therefore they are usually unwashed and sporting the dirt marks which you can then see on press/club photos to prove authenticity.

As an example I was looking at a match worn, unwashed Lampard shirt with captains armband from an away match in 2007 - not even a particularly remarkable match. This was proved authentic to my satisfaction, and offers were invited starting at £600.

&gt;THE DANGERS OF DEBT 
Before I set out the shape of this new economic model, let us first understand the nature of that storm. 

&gt;No one doubts that there were massive failures of financial regulation over the last decade. 

&gt;No one seriously defends the fiscal rules, once spelt out in a Mais Lecture like this, which proved unable to prevent the Government running a budget deficit at the peak of the boom. 

&gt;But we will not draw all the right lessons for the future unless we understand the deep macroeconomic roots of the crisis. 

&gt;Much has already been written about what went wrong. Much more is yet to be written. 

&gt;Perhaps the most significant contribution to our understanding of the origins of the crisis has been made by Professor Ken Rogoff, former Chief Economist at the IMF, and his co-author Carmen Reinhart. 

&gt;In a series of papers and now a book, they have demonstrated in exhaustive historical and statistical detail that while it always seems in the heat of the crisis that 'this time is different', the truth is that it almost never is. 

&gt;As Rogoff and Reinhart demonstrate convincingly, all financial crises ultimately have their origins in one thing - rapid and unsustainable increases in debt. 

&gt;As they write, ""if there is one common theme... it is that excessive debt accumulation, whether it be by the government, banks, corporations, or consumers, often poses greater systemic risks that it seems during a boom.""

True I think lampard is the best midfielder in the last 8 years and one of the best all time, gerrard is a player who has dragged various shit Liverpool teams by the scruff of the neck and pushed them to play above and beyond their abilities to win major trophies whilst scoring phenomenal goals. But he has played in a different position and has been marred by injuries. He's still a cunt though don't get me wrong. 

Xavi and Iniesta have a the best understanding between two players that I have ever seen in my life of watching Football. Their touch and ball control is majestic and their ability to find space is commendable. You have to bear in mind what they do off the ball also. 

I don't think we should belittle these players , as they will go down in history as legends and on their day they're as good as each other. 

Lampard is great because he had the ability of always being in the right place in the right due to his intelligence and being able to read the game like no other. He has an oversized heart so stays fitter for longer and in his day was a great midfield engine.

This means you will have to reclaim your hold baggage at Heathrow in case customs want to search it.  Assuming your flights are both with the same airline, it'll be checked in all the way to Edinburgh, so you'll just re-submit it to the airline after going through customs.

Sometimes you do have to go through security again, and sometimes you don't.  However, if you *do* have to go through security again, they *will* confiscate it if it is over 100ml; that's a rule you can't get around, no matter where you bought it.  You can't take liquids in containers over 100ml through security, end of story.  My advice, therefore, would be to move it to your hold baggage after going through customs but before giving it back to your airline.  Bear this in mind when originally packing your luggage and leave yourself a well padded space near the opening to put it in.

I don't care either way, as it stands as I'm married. But having had more girlfriends than boyfriends, I could have fallen in love with a woman instead. I had a registry office wedding with my Husband and I can't honestly see the difference in that and a CP anyways.

true,Flamekebab,null,null,"No, the reason to pirate video content is because the goods we want aren't available.

You can argue all you like but that won't change the fact that at the moment the service lots of us want exists only in our imagination. Personally I'd set it up but the amount of money it'd cost just in flights and lunches let alone licensing fees is more than I've earned to date.

To illustrate what I'm talking about let's compare both iTunes and Steam. Unless things have changed since I last checked iTunes provides files and says ""look after them, if you want another copy it'll cost you"". I don't like needless clutter if I can avoid it. I've got far too much in my life and I'm trying to cut down on it. This also applies to files - I don't want to have to keep track of stuff, particularly when all that is needed for them is to keep my purchase on file. It's a simple datestamp in a database for gods' sakes.

Now onto Steam. Ten years ago my primary means of acquiring video games was piracy. I'd copy game discs, download things, and share them.

These days my primary source of games is Steam followed by assorted indie bundles and then Kickstarter. I pirate the occasional thing but generally it's more hassle than it's worth.

The important things that Steam does for me are as follows:

1. Library management.

1. Reasonable sales.

1. Automatic patching.

The top thing here is that once I buy a game it's attached to my account. If I use a new computer I can login to Steam and download anything from my library. If I need to free up some space I can just delete the local content until I want to download it again. Managing files is a hassle I don't want to have to bother with, just like patching. If I pirate a game I have to sort out patches, cracks, and hold onto the install files. That's a pain in the arse that I could gladly do without.

Then there's the sales - packs of things are on sale and there's assorted discounts that result in huge sales figures. The things Valve are learning about purchasing patterns in relation to digital shops make for a really interesting read. The marginal cost of digital titles is miniscule and this seems to be frequently forgotten outside the videogames industry.

So for video content what I want is something that keeps track of what I've bought, allows me to download things and delete them whenever I want, and has sales so I can stock up on things. I'm not in a particular hurry to see lots of things but I'm much more likely to make impulse purchases in a sale as the files will then be available from that point on.

Currently no video service exists that offers what I want. I'll pay for content when it's offered to me in a package that works for me. If I make a product and customers don't buy it I don't hassle them and demand to know what's wrong with them - I try to figure out what they want that I'm not giving them. That's how business is supposed to work.",0,1366396524,null,0,false,0,c9il4v5,t3_1co99j,t1_c9il4v5,t1_c9ika64,null,1431499005,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Or are they actually just as lost as the rest of us and really have no clue what is best - and simply think their economist is talking the most sense?

I think we should find this out in a few weeks; if Osborne changes his position on austerity, given that the cornerstone of his position has shown to be fundamentally (if innocently) flawed, then we know he is basing is position on the arguments of economists (however accurate they may be).

If he keeps on with the austerity programme, we can probably assume that his policy is based on his own personal (or his party's) ideology, with the references to cherry-picked studies simply cover.",0,1366396908,null,0,false,0,c9ila75,t3_1co7yd,t1_c9ila75,t1_c9ifdo8,null,1431498935,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

He stole the TARDIS and ran away from Gallifrey, and his name was struck from history. Because of this his moniker *is* the name he accepted. The only other thing that came close was his nickname. But with it being Moffat, we can all assume there's going to be some clever twist around the whole thing. I just hope they don't botch it with some level of ridiculousness.

however i do agree that capitalism is the best incentive driver, and the best for innovation. but i question whether a system that provides basic food, housing, water for all people would have to lose that incentive. progress can still be rewarded. i believe not having to battle with debts would be freeing and lead to more people believing the world was open to them and pursuing what they want out of life instead of being stuck in a depressing cycle of working just to be allowed to exist.

the benefits of EU membership i'm aware of (and i'm no expert):

*more integrated trading partners, which lowers costs and opens doors for new markets or expansions across borders more easily

*EU for me has better human rights record than the conservative party, and things like longer working days, less holidays, lower minimum wage would be hopefully blocked by the EU

*more integration with europe is good for the UK on a cultural level, especially now as the internet enabled global community is growing in awareness all the time

i do agree the EU is a cash drain, and a lot of it is on completely useless bureaucracy. i agree the EU needs lots of reforms, but so does the UK! and i think the UK only counts money lost from the pot when it isn't going into the pockets of the pot holders or their friends, so the revenue argument to me is flawed as our government are corrupt. hague's argument for why we can afford a 10m thatcher funeral? we've saved billions on an EU deal. why can't we pay for the NHS? because we're skint. how much did that banker award himself in severance pay? oh well that's his private business. bank loses money and needs bailout? this is on all our shoulders. it's total hypocrisy at every level and i believe the EU has greater intentions to get the financial sector under control than the UK does.

I wouldn't expect it to be exactly what the master plan was going to be, but it's too good for them not to at least use parts of it.

The point that Hammyman is making, is that as a generalisation, the public is neither well trained with firearms, nor are they likely to want to use them. Obviously, you have exceptions to that rule, Hammy says he's ex-forces, you say you're able to use some weapon systems effectively.  
But as an overall, the public are untrained, and generally insecure around firearms.

Dropping a gun into a situation instantly changes the dynamic of it, more so than dropping a knife into it.

People say that firearms are the ""great equaliser"", which in a way, they are. However, give someone an advantage, and they will use it in a reckless manner.

I do remember seeing a post on one of the last times someone stomped into /r/uk proclaiming that the 2nd Amendment should be something forced on us, it went something a little like this.

""Once you're carrying a gun, you instantly lose all arguments. You become humble, and don't get in anyone's faces. If someone gets in yours, you back down.  
Because if you don't, that argument ends up with a lethal weapon in it straight away. If you draw and you're *not* intending on killing someone, then you're the exact person who shouldn't be carrying in the first place""

There are a large number of americans who do have a very antagonistic relationship with the police for lots of reasons, but there's also another very large group of people in the US (and in other countries) who have an unrelenting loyalty towards law enforcement. There's more hero worship and that extends to police officers in lots of communities where they can do no wrong. 

I don't think we have that in the UK so much. There's an air of suspicion around the police, and they are to be doubted until they can substantiate a claim. Look at *'Plebgate'* were there was a huge question mark over the reliability of the police evidence provided.

Sorry, but I'm going to have to interject here.

The 1689 Bill of Rights in the UK was explicit in that there was to be no Royal interference in the freedom of the people to have arms, but laid out 3 very explicit caveats.

* The arms were to be for the person's *own* defense
* The arms had to be suitable to their class
* The arms had to be non-proscribed by law

Serfs would have had no right under that to own a firearm, given their low social class. There may have been some in a community who were notable enough to be legally allowed a firearm under the Bill, but given that the UK was fragmented, with no actual central governance, firearms would have been utterly trivial for a local authority to proscribe.

Claiming that the 1689 Bill of Rights is the same as the 2nd Amendment just isn't right. The only similarity in them is that they both need to be read in their entirety, and in context of both themselves and the year that they were written.",0,1366401443,null,0,false,0,c9in20c,t3_1cnd1t,t1_c9in20c,t1_c9id3hf,null,1431498100,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

And only about 4 weeks ago i was a passenger when the driver got pulled over, for speeding, which is fair enough.   As soon as the driver stopped in the hard shoulder though, he took off his seat belt and was about to get out of the van.

I said he should wait till they come to us, and that he shouldnt of taken his belt off. So then he started fumbling with the seat belt as the officer walked up.

I think I was generous giving you such a long explanation, you just derided it.

Please stop trying to waste more of my time.

You have a reputation on this subreddit as a troll. You should do yourself a favour and try to sort it out.  

There's no point in me trying to discuss this with you further if you're going to insist (for example) that it's ok for you to use words like 'faggot' and 'retard'.

FYI: I used to regularly use the word 'retard'. I stopped using it when I examined how it's used and what the effects of its use might be. It's not that I'm ""afraid"" to use these words, it's that I've chosen not to. You say how it shows what a cool funny guy you are that you can have a laugh and talk like this - it doesn't. Using these words is the easy thing to do - it's thinking about what you say that's harder. If you honestly imagine someone could ""admire"" you for your comments on here (what? for your ""easygoing"" nature?) then you seriously need counselling. 

And that's only addressing one aspect of your idiocy. I can't think what else right now, but like I say, you've got a recognisable nick on this subreddit, and it ain't because you're this downvote martyr, that we all can't cope with your ""home truths"". It's that your ""opinions"" are vile and you're a fucking idiot. 

If you want to address that, genuinely, then maybe I'll respond to you. But probably not tonight, because you have a lot of work needs doing to fix yourself. You need to approach this not like you're right, but that everyone else might have a point needs listening to.

The doctor has naturally spent a great deal of time upgrading it and tinkering (11 shows a particular fondness for tinkering, evidence by the end of Cold War when he said he'd re-activated a particular circuit in the TARDIS), so it's been massively amplified.

Unlocking doors is just using the vibrations to pick the lock quickly rather than doing it by hand. Messing with computers uses sound waves to replicate a data stream (Remember how really early phones could be ""Hacked"" by whistling at the right frequency? Same principle, stretched a little but if you're THAT fussed then this isn't the show for you). The whole ""Universal Scanner"" part is most likely something that the doctor added on himself in his tinkering, as a literal universal scanner (Looks around and tells him EVERYTHING about what he pointed it at, while the doc is smart/skilled enough to pick out whats relevant at the time). Plus I'd expect he'd have replaced the light (Which would have initially just been a ""tool is currently active"" thing) with something like the infra red sender/receiver on a tv remote.

You mentioned that Rings of Akhaten where the main points that got you, but that fits as well. The creatures where attacking using heavily focused sound waves as well, so the doctors amped up screwdriver was able to match the frequency and counter it for a while. The same principle held the door open - at first I had been like ""What the hell?"" then I remembered that using sound waves to move small objects is the sonic screwdrivers most basic function, so being able to temporarily hold up a door is perfectly reasonable after the doctors tinkering. Especially considering its a door *opened and closed by singing* in the first place...

So yeah. It's starting to push the boundries a little bit, but everything it's done is still theoretically possible with soundwaves, especially when you throw in that the smartest being alive has had a couple of centuries to upgrade it and a LOT of reason to give it overpowered features.",0,1366407794,null,0,false,0,c9ipggi,t3_1cndar,t1_c9ipggi,t3_1cndar,null,1431496969,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The best way to ensure staying in Europe is:

1) Elect a party that is pro-Europe.
2) Elect more MPs that are pro-Europe.

These two factors have enormous ability to influence the referrendum.

The Conservative party can't really be described as pro-Europe; it is at best ambiguous. Not sure if there's a true measure, but I would guess that today the majority of Conservative MPs are anti-Europe.

Given a majority in the Commons, they could:

true,Deserak,null,null,"I remember a remark somewhere about Humans having the closest physical resemblance to Time Lords (Think I read it somewhere about the old series, but I do recall the throwaway remark with rose ""You look human..."" ""Well you look Time Lord.""). So he probably sees earth as a younger, less experienced version of gallifrey. So there's a parental aspect, we're kind of like his adopted children that he feels responsible for looking after. 

Then there's the loneliness factor - again, because humans most closely resemble Time Lords, we're sort of the next best thing. Even before the time war made him the last time lord in existance, The Doctor was still an outcast due to him stealing a TARDIS and running off to interfere with the universe against the Time Lords rules. They weren't hunting him down as far as I'm aware, but he still wasn't invited out to their parties, and with humans he can basically pretend his companions are like him just with alergies. 

Third is another point that's already been brought up, he just likes us. Humanity is depicted in the series as overall being incredibly curious. It gets us into a lot of trouble, which the doc has to come bail us out of, but he doesn't mind, because we're sharing his passion for learning new things, and its humans who seem to keep finding new ways to surprise him or catch his attention (For a 1000+ year old man, not being boring is an important factor).

Fourth, if we assume that each regeneration sort of repressed the memories of his previous lives, or at least becomes emotionally distant to them (I kind of figure they'd become less his own memories and more like he got told all the details by a very descriptive friend, so he's experienced it but not experienced it, if that makes any sense at all). More often that not, he's regened with human companions around keeping an eye on him. Which means his love of humanity would always be one of the first things to come back to him, and his interest in other species usually has more time to 'settle' into the back of his mind before he encounters them again, kind of like hooking up with an ex girlfriend the day after you break up vs a couple of years later.

Finally, thinking back to what I know of the first doctor (I've read about the early seasons, but never watched them), after he took the TARDIS and went into exile, he wound up on earth. And he lived there long enough for his grandaughter to be enrolled at a school and be picked out by her teachers as unusual. Probably longer, since it would be fairly easy for him to shift to a different part of Earth and continue blending in than it would be for him to shift to a different planet entirely. So by the time he starts taking companions, Earth is kind of like his second home after Gallifrey. I believe one incarnation of the doctor winds up exiled here as well, something along the lines of punishment for interfering was that he'd have to stay put and look after us, and the sentence was never lifted, he just got sick of staying put and undid what the other time lords had done to stop the TARDIS working. Throw in that Gallifrey no longer exists, it makes sense he'd keep coming back to earth again and again, and why[](#s ""he'd pick earth as the place to hide away both after losing Amy &amp; Rory, and when he needed to contemplate Clara in Bells of St John."")

So really he just see's himself as one of us; friend of the family, not really related and has a different history/life style, but still gets invited to all the family gatherings and treated like just another one of the uncles.",0,1366410656,null,0,false,0,c9iqgn8,t3_1cmbkt,t1_c9iqgn8,t3_1cmbkt,null,1431496424,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I nearly hit someone on the way home, because they come absolutely *belting* out into 40mph traffic without looking and he had no helmet on... he also had fucking *headphones* in.  How could he have heard me coming when he made no effort to look?

The guy in the car behind me actually pulled up alongside him and gave him hassle.

Said it yesterday, will say it again: **cycling in this country needs to be tightened up and more controlled**.  Everyone talking about the Nordic countries etc., their standard of cycling and road sense is much better because people actually give a fuck.  Here, they don't.

Ride your bike without a helmet?  No problem.
Drive your car without a seatbelt?  That's a fine and points on your licence.

Ride a bike without mirrors?  No problem.
Drive your car with a damaged or missing wing mirror?  Illegal.

[**Fitch**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22219382) (19 April): **AA+** (Downgrade)

&gt;Fitch said its downgrade ""primarily reflects a weaker economic and fiscal outlook"" but returned its outlook to ""stable"", removing the threat of further rate action in the near term.

[**Standard &amp; Poor's**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/apr/05/uk-triple-a-credit-rating-standard-and-poors) (5 April): **AAA** (No change)

&gt; ""We continue to believe the government's efforts over the next few years to cut its fiscal deficit will likely drag on economic growth,"" S&amp;P said, adding that weak spending by debt-burdened households and recession in the eurozone could also depress GDP. 

[**Moody's**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/feb/23/george-osborne-britain-aaa) (23 February) **AA1** (Downgrade)

&gt; Moody's, the first of the major agencies to remove the UK from the elite club of AAA countries, blamed ""subdued growth"" and a ""high and rising debt burden"" for the decision to cut the rating by one notch to AA1.

[**IMF**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22164028) (16 April) 2013 growth forecast lowered from 1% to 0.7%

&gt; ""Greater near-term flexibility in the path of fiscal adjustment should be considered in the light of lacklustre private demand.""

Osborne is downplaying this but if the figures for the first quarter of 2013 show we've hit a triple dip recession he's going to be facing a lot more pressure over the next few months. 

This is pretty awful news considering that Osborne promised in 2010 that:

When I first went looking for a job (the only thing on my CV before was a part time position at McDonalds) they were really friendly and found me a job the next day. They moved me around a few times are the work was only temporary but eventually put me in a place that had full time positions. I applied and ended up getting the job and staying there for two and half years.

Fast forward now four years and I've just finished uni and have worked every summer and even some Christmas/Easter breaks for agencies.

I've done all kinds of work. Mostly administration for very poor pay but I needed to take what I can get. Some of the best work was delivering furniture for IKEA. Really good fun on the best days actually.

With regards to it being stable it depends greatly. Some agencies will advertise temporary ongoing work. Some will offer contractual positions for 3, 6, 9 month etc.

As a matter of fact my girlfriend is actually a recruitment consultant and many of her workers use the work as a primary source of income. They are often registered with several agencies though to ensure they always get a full working week as she gives them shifts on and off and I'm sure the other agencies do the same.

I would advise you at least register with a few agencies and explain your position. Just remember that although they can take the piss sometimes it is after all within their interests to get you into work at a place you will stay at.

If you want to ask me any further questions you can PM me. I could even speak to the girlfriend about another agency specific.

When I was a cyclist, I lived in constant fear of car, van and lorry drivers running me over.  It seemed at the time that all motorists were psychopaths who were out to kill me.  On one occasion, a car driver actually drove into me while I was sat at a red light, because ""sorry mate, I didn't see you there!"".  He actually fucking drove into me!

But then, when I became a motorist, I lived in constant fear of cyclists launching themselves under my wheels due to their arrogance and stupidity.  It seemed that every cyclist had an ambition to die under my wheels.

When I gained my HGV licence, I became aware of just how dangerous my vehicle was, and how ignorant cyclists were. Cyclists would try to undertake me around corners, despite the fact that I could crush them under my wheels and not even feel it.

In truth, I think that standards for road users in Britain need to be raised across the board.

The only way would be if the TARDIS, like, jumped universes. Which could totally happen in Doctor Who, but it would feel horribly out of place in Firefly.

They're just too different. Firefly is all about trying to bring a sense of gritty realism to the spaceship genre, whereas Doctor Who subscribes more to the Douglas Adams-y 'in an infinite universe, anything can and will happen' style of scifi. I think it would diminish both shows to combine them. It's, like, a 2+2=3 situation.

I think it would be a wise idea if more people donated organs to the NHS voluntarily or upon death. Certain organs like kidneys are more cost effective than dialysis which costs 30,000 per year until death.A potential saving of around £630million could be made if the 21,000 dialysis users got kidney transplant. The cost benefit would only be apparent after the 2nd year of treatment.transplantation may also have a second benefit of allowing hospitals to have more time and space to  deal with other tasks instead of dialysis. http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/newsroom/fact_sheets/cost_effectiveness_of_transplantation.asp

And I definitely would want it to be David Tennant, not Matt Smith. (LOVE Smith, Tennant just fits the 'Verse better.)

What if Blue Sun sensed some sort of immense power through something with the word quantum in it, and pulled that power source through from a parallel universe into their own. That source of power turns out to be thr TARDIS. Realizing it was being pulled into a trap the likes of which even the Doctor may be unprepared for, the TARDIS locates whoever has the best chance of helping the Doctor take down Blue Sun and the Alliance, and transports him to their location. The cargo bay of the Firefly-Class Mid-Bulk Transport Ship *Serenity*. River Tam has recently been recaptured by the alliance, so the Serenity crew and the Doctor team up to serve their mutual interest.

true,douchebag_karren,rose,Rose,"I think my frustration with 11 stems from the fact that he went back to being a silly kid. I've only seen new who. I stared with 9 who was  very adult, and very serious, even when he was being funny. In fact my favorite 9 episode is the Doctor Dances, and I love the part at the end when he is being a bit silly, but for the most part he is rather grown up. Then comes 10 who has this whole gammat of adult emotions, he's sorry, he's vengeful, he falls in love, etc. He is far sillier than 9 but you still know you're dealing with a very intelligent adult. Then comes 11. 11 is very much a child with the brain of a 1000 year old alien. he laughs at stupid shit, he does silly, things all the time, and really isn't very serious until later. And I think this is the part that sort of rubbed me the wrong way in the begining, because I wanted to have faith that the doctor knew what the hell he was doing, and it didn't really seam like he did. with 9 and 10 it was sort of have a plan and tweak as needed where 11 is, just go along with what ever and pretend it was a plan. 

The point is, it took me a long time to warm up to him, because I wanted him to be more mature. And then he died. The Wedding of River Song was the first time 11 made me cry, and I started to feel it. then I watched The christmas special with the widow and the wardrobe, and I cried again. (I know everyone hates that one, but I loved it. I felt like the doctor was better in that one, In the christmas carol one, he was again doing rather foolish things without considering the concequences and while it was a decent story, it didn't pull my heartstrings like the widow one did for some reason). 

And now that Amy and Rory are gone, I feel like he's grown up, just a bit, and I have started to really like him. Especially in the first one of 7.5 where he became very Bad Ass and demanded everyone be downloaded again. The fire in his voice in the second episode when he's talking to the Planet/god thing, that was my doctor, a bit more grown up, a little bit angry, and a just a smidge more responsible.

On the attack Yaya pushes up into the middle band and Tevez tries to make runs (pushing up from CAM/SS). 

It becomes a bit more of a 4-1-3-2...which is a formation I'd support if we had at least 2 world class strikers and could teach whoever plays on our wings to drop back and defend once in a while (HazMaCar).",0,1366438874,null,0,false,0,c9iynev,t3_1coykn,t1_c9iynev,t1_c9iwos6,null,1431492495,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,Syrae,tardis,TARDIS,"I've been slowly watching the classic series, and every show runner and actor has put their stamp on the show. I think the biggest change between RTD and Moffat's eras can be best summed up by the change in the Doctor's theme between 10 and 11. 

[9 and 10's theme](http://youtu.be/U-hHurzkric) is sad, almost melancholy. The weight of the Time War and being the last Time Lord rests heavily on him, as well as the cost of losing his companions. 10 gets more hero music, but there's still a lot of that lonely undertone to the theme. [11's theme](http://youtu.be/K7VmOZ4Ppj8) is very adventurous and boisterous. It's a song that's a bit cheeky but all about action and moving forward, and it's pretty much 100% hero music.

Moffat has a tendency to pick a lot of flashy elements for his era: the Doctor's theme, the gimmicky story elements (wobbly wobbly time travel, big reveals about the Doctor and his associates, seemingly killing off characters), and a bigger budget. RTD had a smaller budget, but even his era had some flaws: the characters got much more emotional, their relationships could get a bit ""heavy"", the specials had a tendency to include everything PLUS the kitchen sink. But that more emotion-driven storytelling of RTD is definitely reflected in his Doctors' themes.

In the end, everyone will end up having their favorite eras based on the show runner or Doctor or companion (or some combination thereof). Nothing wrong with that, but unlike other long running shows the only constant in Doctor Who is that it changes. Not just the people, but also the tone of the show.

As for the stimulating the cluster of cells, that might be a stretch of the sonic's capabilities given the circumstances.

true,satanspanties,,President of the Official Stellar Tortoise FC Fan Club,"&gt; I don't like the way that international news is so focused on English speaking countries.

Is it though?  BBC World News page right now is USA, China, Pakistan, Venezuela, Serbia, Kosovo, USA again, Bahrain, Italy, France, Ireland, India and Poland.  Doesn't seem too English speaking centric to me, especially considering the high number of countries that have English as an official language.

That aside, the reason the Boston bombing is getting so much coverage and Iraq isn't is that bombs going off in Boston is unusual, bombs going off in Iraq, sadly, isn't.  We kind of expect it to happen, and things that we're expecting aren't really news.  News program makers will inevitably give more airtime to things that are unusual; compare news coverage of snow in March in the UK to snow in March in, say, Michigan.  Even if Boston *hadn't* happened, it's doubtful Iraq would have got the same kind of coverage just because it's not that unusual.

The other thing is, of course, if you get a lot of your news from links on Reddit and similar sites, people are going to report the news that's most important to them.  I'd be very confident in betting there are a lot more Bostonians on Reddit, and the internet in general, than Iraqis.

Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't care about people being killed in Iraq any less than in Boston, but there are reasons Boston is getting more coverage.",0,1366452243,null,0,false,0,c9j0fe7,t3_1cpgw9,t1_c9j0fe7,t1_c9j07qr,null,1431491658,3,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,3

I grew up in a two-up two-down Victorian terraced house of the sort that should have been demolished after the war. As soon as I could, I bought a newly-built home. The fact that my dad still lives in the same house saddens me. My parents should've been able to buy a new home when they married but they weren't available and for many, still aren't. This country needs to stop living in the past and move on.
It annoys me when I hear that ""old communities have been destroyed"". That's bull. What really happens I'd that most people move on and up and others get left behind. That's life. Change is inevitable and necessary and those who don't agree never lived in a mining village in Durham in the 70's and 80's. It was shit. 
I remember the miners' strike very well. In private, few supported the miners. They were seen as overpaid and greedy and Scargill was hated by many.

&gt;The Office of Fair Trading has launched an investigation into GSK, alleging it abused its market dominance by agreeing so-called ""pay for delay"" agreements between **2001 and 2004** to protect the position of its drug Seroxat.

Then 

&gt;Seroxat, which is still available on the NHS, was launched in the early 1990s and became one of the world's biggest-selling drugs, overtaking Prozac. **However, the patent came to an end in 2004 and generic, cheaper versions flooded the market, hitting GSK's profits.**

So they paid firms to delay the development of a generic seroxat, which would not have come off patent till 2004. So generic versions would not have been able to be sold until 2004. I am assuming that would delay the release of generic versions for a couple of years after it came off patent, giving GSK another couple of years profit. And assuming GSK would not be applying to another seroxat patent of course.  But according to the article the market was 'flooded' with generics as soon as the patent was up. 

Something doesn't sound right, either I am misunderstanding or the article is misleading.

true,Werevark,eccleston,Eccleston,"I disagree with some of your arguments, although Smith is my least favorite of the New Who docs, although I like them all.

I actually really liked these companions; I think that Moffat's team has really made memorable and amazing companions. Amy was very proactive, had a thing with the doctor that she realized was just a thing, and she had different dynamics with every other character. Rory's journey from a guy who new absolutely nothing about what the hell was going on to someone who's constantly exasperated by the doctor's odd choices. He also has his own arc and a life outside the doctor. River Song's arc is amazing in every way, and she has the best relationship with the doctor I think ever. I am not a fan of the current Clara, but I loved her in the Christmas episode; she seemed far superior to him in whit, if not in raw intelligence or knowledge. I agree that their arcs are more elaborate, but I don't think that means they are in any way uninteresting.

I think the 11th Doctor is closer to 9 than to 10 in temperament, which is odd considering who followed who. Remember that the 9th Doctor was ready to destroy all the Daleks and Earth, but only stopped at the last moment. Compare that to 11 at Demon's Run where he had it planned to a T that, with these people helping him, he can take an entrenched fortress and save his friends all without spilling a drop of blood.That being said, I'm not always a fan of his occasional obliviousness to the world. Sometimes he acts like a child and sometimes he acts like a professor, which I think is actually one of the most charming things about 11, but I agree he does do it at some odd times. I do agree with your second to last comment though; that sometimes they just throw stuff into episodes just 'cause it'd be cool; like Dinosaurs in space.

I will agree that the storylines in 11's reign have been far more 'focused' than 9 or 10's. I think it's really because a season arc from those previous Docs could basically be built around a single word -examples and in order (for me only!) 9=Badwolf, 10[1]=Torchwood, 10[2] Saxon, 10[3]Vanishing Planets - whereas 11's are far more distinct, with the first being the crack in Amy's bedroom, the second being...pretty much whatever really, kind of the history of River Song or the Silence, and the third being...who knows. Thinking about it, I think that you're right regarding 11's second season, it was drawn out in a couple ways, and I wasn't as big a fan. And this season just seems a mess this far with a critical change in tone, companions, and goals coming out of nowhere. I hope they can salvage the season, we won't know until they finish it how well they've thought it out.

Say, for arguments sake, that they decided that all money would be issued by The Bank of England. The first thing that would happen is that the banks would lobby privately and discreetly for this change never to happen. Most likely they'd kill it at birth. But say they didn't. Then they'd run around with their hair on fire and try to panic the general public that it would result in the end of the world. They might even stage a run on a bank and get the public to bail them out again just to get people worried.

If this didn't work it would mean that the government were serious about having a monopoly on currency creation. The banks would sulk. And then they'd go right on about their business: locating venture capital for risky enterprises and using other people's money to invest for returns. The lending rate would go up to cover the costs of the bank repaying the venture capitalists. Vast sums would be gambled and won and lost. 

Currency wouldn't collapse because the guarantee would be that the UK would always have a tax base and therefore an income. Because, as they say, the only two sure things in life are death and taxes.
