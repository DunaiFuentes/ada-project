He's being pretty disrespectful to the club by talking up how much he'd like to play for Madrid and how he couldn't turn them down, I know reporters are asking him but he doesn't have to give the sort of answers he's giving.

He's complaining about the press lying about him but here he is again giving them something to write about, he's giving ambiguous answers to questions about his future which is only fueling the speculation. He could have simply dismissed the questions or at least say he doesn't want to comment but he's not doing that, he's giving the answers he's given for a reason, he's not naive, he knows how the press are going to pick up on it.

He's saying all this after the club stood by him through so much, he dragged the clubs name through the dirt numerous times yet the club defended him, and here he is now talking up another team in another league. If he didn't want to leave he would have kept his mouth shut.

If he had said he want's to play for titles then I'd understand, but his media excuse is bullshit. If he goes to Spain he's going to get the same coverage he get's here when he does something controversial, same as well if he ends up in Italy where it's even worse.

I'd love for him to stay, he's a phenomenal talent, adds so much unpredictability to the side and would be extremely difficult to replace.

general side effects of this include more jobs which produce something of value which is in demand, as opposed to government jobs which can just be there for the sake of keeping employment up, creating something which is not in demand anywhere, ie will end up wasted. like if i rounded up a bunch of people to build a statue of me in my local town, jobs are created, people get money and the economy is stimulated by them spending, but you've still wasted a lot of materials on the statue which would be better used elsewhere on things more in demand (and thus giving greater profit, therefore more money to my employees/more employees for me/more employees for brothels and drug dealers if i hog all the profits and blow it all on hookers and coke).

the austerity thing would like to do away with such jobs i guess because they see it that way, that in splashing out now you'd have to pay a lot more in the long run, whereas their opposition i think would rather spread it out and ""end boom and bust"".

I think Mr. Darcy is rather dated and it has been proven that it is more men who seek this form of solace rather than women and the availability is all too real and what pained me was the access that the younger generations may have to some of this completely unsuitable material. Past societies have seldom relied upon some of the more extreme forms of pornography I am referring to and it will therefore affect sexual development.

And I was not in any alluding to a ban an all forms of pornography, I was stating that this availability and lack of regulation can cause over indulgence. And it is this kind of over indulgence that causes a problem.

I agree with you that there are sensible actions to be taken and they should be addressed seen as we live at a time where there is no difficulty in viewing this kind of material.

All of that said it is a perfectly healthy function, I am entirely for it aside from (probably due to my man X) those who live a life through, and cannot function without internet pornography.

true,Flamekebab,null,null,"&gt;I think Mr. Darcy is rather dated and it has been proven that it is more men who seek this form of solace rather than women

Mr. Darcy being dated is irrelevant. Did you miss my point? It doesn't matter if it's men or women either. The point we're both making is about escapism. Playing too much World of Warcraft is a problem, wanking one's life away is a problem, being a shopaholic is a problem. They're all escapist activities that are detrimental to many aspects of a person's life should they be overindulged.

My ""Mr. Darcy"" comparison was just drawing on the classic cliché to illustrate a point. Admittedly just because it's a cliché doesn't mean I haven't seen it first hand. Allowing popular culture to build up a ""prince charming"" standard and then rejecting potential partners based on it is just another form of what you're taking issue with regarding ""over masturbation"". One could call it ""relationship masturbation""!

&gt;completely unsuitable material

""Unsuitable""? Why is one adult allowed to decide what is suitable for another? Regulating access for those who aren't adults yet is an issue, of course, but I think the solution to that is so much easier than far-reaching legislation.

It seems strange to me that some reasonable sum isn't put aside to create a new standard for routers. Said routers would run user friendly software allowing simple configuration of filters and exceptions. Build up a marketing campaign (like the ""five a day"" one) and suitable support framework and we're good to go.

When it comes to internet access on phones and the like why is it so difficult to sort that out?

If creating a sane and well managed solution is too much bother then I would posit that the problem is overhyped and irrelevant. If we're going to do something about it let's do it right so that it doesn't end up some nanny-state rubbish. I'd rather create a tool to make parenting easier than try to censor the internet itself ""for the sake of the children"".

&gt;Past societies have seldom relied upon some of the more extreme forms of pornography I am referring to and it will therefore affect sexual development.

This statement is basically meaningless. You're comparing apples to asteroids. I'm sure it'll have an effect of some sort but so does everything we do. No society has ever been like ours before.

&gt;I was stating that this availability and lack of regulation can cause over indulgence.

No, it simply makes over indulgence easier. You might as well say lakes cause drowning. 

------------

Drawing a literal line under that I would posit that we simply do not know how this will affect people in the long run. What I do know is that we're learning things like the fact that [BDSM seems to actually be good for mental health](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12192/abstract;jsessionid=4835A42B2283087B0FC47C55F58BA139.d02t02). That doesn't really surprise me but I'm sure it'd surprise others and they'd vehemently argue against what's perceived as deviant behaviour. Research indicates that such attitudes may well be wrong though.

Similarly access to a wide variety of porn doesn't bother me because I don't see what the issue is. I see no problem with people learning about new things and seeing if they like them - as long as we're all consenting adults of course.

Having someone tell me what I am and am not allowed to enjoy disgusts me. For someone more vanilla than myself to deem certain things ""unsuitable"" suggests that despite the social contract some how I am less of a person because I am different to them. Aren't we supposed to be equal?

""Over masturbation"" isn't a porn supply problem, it's a mental health problem. Sex addiction is a problem for some, should we limit the supply of sex?

I'd rather we put our efforts into teaching healthy behaviour and an appreciation for moderation. ""Healthy behaviour"" in this case refers to avoiding the pitfalls of addiction and social isolation, just to be clear. If someone wants to spend their evenings locked in a cage while someone spits on them then that's fine too - as long as it's not undermining their ability to receive a healthy level of social interaction.

Given the complexity of the human psyche I think it's a tad more complicated than ""What with all this porn we're able to wank far too much""!

I think last I saw Moses' completed crossing percentage was in single digits… That's terrible ( I could be wrong on that percentage though so correct me if I'm wrong). 

We need depth if we are going to compete on multiple fronts. Plus with depth we can rotate players and keep them fresh. Remember Hazard wasn't exactly brilliant for a solid period of time. If we don't add at least one quality attacking player it will be another season like the last. Where if Mata and/or Hazard don't play we won't win. We can't afford to do that again if we realistically want to win the PL instead of being satisfied with a top 4 place. 

I definitely agree though that we need to bring in a quality deep lying playmaker.

true,thashicray,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"The point I was making, as previously stated, lies within a certain minority of people. If you honestly think that I am for a 'nanny state' then you're barking up the wrong tree. A personal bias may lie within my words and I do not in any way condone a puritan sensibility which it seems you have derived from what I've said, my viewpoint is derived from meeting people who, upon reflection saw significant parts of their lives wasted because they felt more comfortable in not addressing their own issues.

The Mr Darcy point is in reference to relationships, and to pick and choose is always a valued component when looking for a partner you feel will suit yourself (making people laugh, good conversation, etc). If one were to prefer to sit at home alone in front of a screen rather than meet people at a point where they haven't truly experienced them then surely this is an issue?

And the fact that I referred to past societies was in my conveyance that I am worried that in this availability there may be some casualties in the sense that those who are too young to understand could view this UNSUITABLE material. The term unsuitable meaning that there are certain ages one should be viewing this, points of development where as an adult there would be no problem. However it seems that we're talking about the same thing, I personally am worried about who views this material depending on age, which you state can be moderated and your suggestion sounds great.

Although I don't see why you feel the need to be so flippant with what I've said, I am thinking independently and the choices of adults are none of my business, we are all individuals. But perhaps my concern has been misplaced with intrigue when I refer to past societies, I do, as an individual find it strange that there will be generations who, in growing up with this may prefer to indulge virtually rather than physically as antiquated as that may seem on my part. And you're right no society has been like ours before and all the more reason for taking into account and objectively approach certain problems which could possibly become more prevalent in the future.

And I did refer to the educational aspect which should be addressed by society, don't think I want to sit in my ivory tower spouting vitriol at those whom I see of lesser morals than myself, my concern is relevant and it isn't as simple as ""wanking too much.""",0,1370050474,null,0,false,0,ca9uyu6,t3_1fe19n,t1_ca9uyu6,t1_ca9ufxk,null,1430966790,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Exactly. Either the agencies will have to trawl through loads of data. Having to figure out what metaphors are being used for which terrorist acts OR they have to monitor specific individuals which they can presumably already do through a court order. 

Also terrorist will just stop using the internet for stuff if they think they are being monitored. These guys were friends that used a car and meat cleaver. The internet or even phone was never necessary to their plan. Human intelligence and targeting individuals would be far more effective that a nationwide sweep. And the same is probably true for child abuse.

at the risk of sounding like another reddit pedo-apologist that should be taken out and shot.  According to the BBC news at 10 on friday

http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007mplc/broadcasts/2013/05

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/9/43

less than 1% of people that view online images go on to abuse children. So how effective a spying on everyone policy would be is debatable.  Also all search engines filter out the stuff. I'm all for ""red flag"" searches being reported but to spy on everyone all the time seems like a waste of resources.

Politicians want to say whatever's in the zeitgeist.  A real harm reduction policy would cost money. And that's something governments don't want to commit to.  Words are cheap and being seen to do something is more valuable to politicians than coming up with coherent plan that both catches the bad guys and leaves others free from government snooping.



**TL;DR**  Reporting ""Red flag"" searches and targeting individuals is probably far more effective use of resources than spying on everyone all the time. and we all hide lots of perfectly legal opinions.

**My Reply is;  ""I have plenty to hide - and none of it's illegal""**. 

* I hide my political opinions from coworkers. 
* I hide my contempt for people I know so that certain social groups can function. 
*  I hide my views on there being no god from people who do believe in a god. 
* I hide my opinion on the badger cull and fur from animal rights protesters. 
* I hide my thoughts on peoples parenting or lack of it from them. 
* I hide my thoughts about my neighbours from them.
* I hide information about my work from competitors.

Shit I have a lot to hide but none of it is illegal, none of it is the governments business , all of it could cause a potential shit-storm for me and no one hides it better than me.  Any government spying program is going to be made up from people and therefore open to flaws.  Why should the government be given a large database of legal but potentially damaging information that could ruin someone? What reassurances do we have that if we protest against the government ( say support for the syrian government or wanting to end sanctions on a country because it harms the population and doesn't weaken the regime ) that this mass of information won't be used against us.  If the secret service really wanted to punish me all they would need to do is tell people what I've said behind their backs. Or tell people my unpopular opinions like my total indifference to fur farming or my objection to sanctions on zimbabwe ( mugabe is still in power yet the people suffered immensely). We should be in control of who knows what about us not the government. The threat of a deliberate or accidental leak will have a chilling effect of the voicing of unpopular opinions.  ( eg. I have never told anyone about my opinion on zimbabwe sanctions because I don't want to screamed at and ostracised there's nothing illegal about my opinions but the emotional reaction from people would be one of utter contempt towards me).  Ultimately if everyone is afraid of voicing a controversial opinion because the government will know, it will lead to a form of self censorship where only opinions that everyone agrees with are voiced.  It acts as a form of censorship and gives power to the media especially mainstream news that set these ""popular opinions"" ( often by giving emotionally manipulative reports and one sided facts ).  To add risk to voicing opinion to the entire population just because a few people are terrorist or pedophiles is fundamentally unfair and is a form of buck passing. Just because the government agencies can't catch criminals ( who had track records of dodgy behavior - see above comment)  doesn't mean we should all be treated as suspect.

To answer the questions:

*Will he stay or will he go?* - Ultimately? I say he stays but it may be a long and frustrating transfer window for us.

*How much is he worth?* - How much is he *worth* is probably much higher than how much he'll actually be sold for but I guess around 40-50m pounds makes sense.

*Who can we buy with Suarez money?* - I personally don't like the idea of reinvesting a big portion of the money on one player (unless, I suppose, it's Cavani or someone like that but doubtful that will happen).

1) contest to see who can redesign the badge and make it look the awesomest?

2)
If anyone has xbox and likes to play fifa, we could do a Spurs tournament in head to head or ultimate team (where 6 of your 11 players have to be spurs?)

3) 
One word to sum up the last season and one word to describe how you think next season will turn out?

4) make a chatroom, i know we often use reddit for match threads....  
but making a chatroom would make it a more constant row of comments during the game rather than just the most up voted comments being seen ( also it would be pretty awesome to see the chatroom blow up with 3900 ""GOAL!!!!"" comments being posted)

5) storm the gooner subreddit!!!

6) Start some threads to follow our men as they go through international friendlies and summer qualifiers?

true,southerngangster,lfcflame,,"sorry, yes I completely agree. However, that's assuming we break even if we sell Suarez for 45m (or what have you) a pick up two 15+ goal scorers for roughly 20m a piece. What I'm saying is i'd rather keep Suarez and replace Downing with a 15+ goal a season player for 20m (or what have you) than sell him for two new players. In the scenario suggested, we lose Suarez but add two players capable of scoring roughly the same amount of goals in all. Financially, we also break even. What I would prefer is that we keep Suarez and sign a new 15+ goal a season player (preferably a RW). We would roughly take a hit of 20m that would restrict us from improving our squad elsewhere (a great CDM or LB probably), but we would maintain consistency in the squad by only replacing 1 player of the front 4 instead of 2. Theoretically, we would even improve our goal total from last season instead of maintaining the status quo by selling Suarez and picking up two new players. As for the role of Suarez, I think it would be good to have him be the player other teams look to try and stop. It lets Daniel be more himself and frees up Cou to do his thing while every one is worried about what Suarez will do. Cou played great at the last few months of the season, but I worry once teams begin to figure him out how he'll handle it. Plus, even though he has a lot of experience for someone his age he hasn't been involved in a true full season so far. I worry he won't be able to maintain that quality for the entire season. Which might be another good reason to keep Suarez since he's the only one in our team who could replace what Cou does. Also, with teams worried about Suarez it'll allow our ""new RW"" player to flourish as well. just my thoughts",0,1370060061,null,0,false,0,ca9xn38,t3_1fe67a,t1_ca9xn38,t1_ca9scx4,null,1430965202,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

A pairing of Modric and Mikel could really make our pivot hum.  That is the position we need to address most.  

Other positions
Leftback: will Jose give P van Aanholt a try?  I doubt it and thats why I am in favor of Luke Shaw if we can.  A good/young/homegrown player who could learn a trick or two from the best leftback going.  I just dont think Ryan has what it takes to step into his shoes.
Keeper: Promote Blackman or Walker to firstteam and I keep hearing rumours of Cesar being a possiblity which for a season or two (and if he wanted to be second fiddle to Cech) would be a great pickup.
Center Back: we have a couple of great youngsters in omeruo/kalas but I dont think they are quite ready for promotion.  I dont know enough of the kid we are linked to currently, Mangala, to say much.  JT isnt getting any younger and God forbid if Ivan leaves but that position needs a youth infusion.

Also to be honest, I am not sure why we are being linked with soo many strikers.  We are stuck with Torres and and just signed Ba.  No one will pay his wages and they too will want a striker who scores regularly.  If we could fob off Torres like we did Sheva and just pay the majority of his wages on loan it would suck FFS wise but it would open up a much need slot for a new/scoring striker (my choice with be Lewandowski)  /novel over",0,1370060750,null,0,false,0,ca9xtgw,t3_1fenfm,t1_ca9xtgw,t1_ca9vvo2,null,1430965117,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"I have to disagree. And I would like to try and explain why if you'll take the time to hear me out.

A vote simply expresses which candidate you think is the best out of the available choices. There is no legal or implicit agreement that you agree with all of their election manifesto. That would be ridiculous! There's no way you'll ever find a candidate whose every single opinion is the same as yours. Please be realistic!

On the flip side, neither is there any legal obligation for the candidate to stick to that manifesto if elected. As we all saw with the lib dens.

**So not finding a candidate with a ""perfect"" manifesto is no reason not to vote.**

Furthermore, people's opinions change all the time. Politicians are no exception. If they get elected, they can always completely change policy if they wish. This can happen for any number of reasons. New information can come from new studies or research, or public opinion will change. Sometimes they have no choice because opposition from other politicians or the public is simply too great. *Just because they became PM doesn't make them all powerful.*

Even the threat of losing votes for his party can force a PM to change tack. Just look at Cameron scrambling to the right thanks to the threat of ukip. All the while trying to remain moderate and pushing for gay marriage to try and make the centre and left hate him less.

**Even if a candidate you hate is very likely to win, you still have the power through other votes and political action to change their policy. So that is no reason not to vote.**

Let's say you hate all of the main parties a lot and simply don't want any of them to remain in power, even though you don't particularly like any of the smaller parties.

Based on what I understand of our voting system (correct me if I'm wrong), if you don't vote at all, then you are not only reducing the percentage vote for the small parties. You are effectively increasing the percentage vote of the main parties as well! This is result of our FPTP voting system, whether we like it or not.

Allow me to explain: Say there are 100 registered voters. 80 of them vote big party A and 20 vote small party B. That's obviously an 80% win for party A. Now imagine 5 people from the block of 20 actually don't like party B much and abstain. Party A now has 80/95=84.2%. By not voting, these 5 people have *increased* party A's share by 4 percentage points!

That was a simplified case. Shall we consider a slightly more complex one?

Out of a population of 60 million, let's say 40 million are eligible and registered to vote. Last general election had a turnout of about 60% so let's say 24 million people actually vote. The breakdown is 13 million voted party A, 10 million voted party B, 1 million voted party C, the small, unknown party. Party A has won thanks to having more votes than any other party and also hold more than 50%, making them fully in control of Parliament.

What if 3 million of the people who didn't vote turned up? These 3 million care about what is happening to their country under the last 5 years of party A but feel powerless to stop it because of how powerful party A is. The problem is that they hate party B too (although not as much) and even dislike party C! So what to do??

If they don't vote, party A is sure to win and control the government with no real opposition for many more years thanks to their &gt;50% majority.

If they vote for party B, party A's vote share becomes 13/27=48%, and party B's share becomes 13/27=48% too! Neither party wins outright or has the majority required to lead effectively. Some sort of coalition must be made.

If they vote party C, the lesser of 3 evils, party A's vote share is 48%, B's share is 37% and C's share is now 15%. Although A wins, they don't hold a majority and cannot govern effectively. A coalition must be formed and C is very likely to be a part of it.

Either outcome is marginally better than not voting since they reduce party A's power. This is tactical voting.

If party C (or D or E or any tiny party) gains ground, it becomes momentum for the next election and each successive election will increase the relevance of the tiny party provided people keep turning up to vote.

**Tactical voting and is a reality in our current system, whether we like it or not. By not voting, you are tipping the scales in favour of the mainstream party. If you don't want that to happen, then you need to vote!**

I type too much but I don't think it's possible to over stress how important it is to vote.

When I discovered Doctor Who, it was during Colin Baker's term, (or at least that's what the local PBS station was showing at the time.) It was right at the beginning of the Trial of a Time Lord arc, and then after that I experienced my first regeneration, as the series went into the Sylvester McCoy era.

I immediately understood what was going on, having seen the sort of thing a number of times before in soap operas. What I found to be cool was that they acknowledged this change in-character, and created a character that was in many ways supernatural and immortal.

And so as I watch this next generation of Who fandom emerge, I just have to laugh as I watch the fanboys argue over Tennant vs. Smith.

But if Mata, Oscar, Hazard, and KDB are your offensive players in a 4-2-2-2 then you will really need to have strength in the center of midfield to contend in the premier league and to challenge the physicality of the germans. I don't think Romeu and Gundogan will do the job when Luiz needs a rest. I think signing a player like Yann M'Villa from Ruben Kazan could be that player.

So if you want to play a 4-2-2-2, I agree that the team is solid defensively. If Luiz moves to midfield, that leaves the team with Ivan., Terry, and Cahill. Four cb's would be great, but with Luiz this should work. I don't think the team needs to spend money on a LB right now. I think Bertrand deserves a chance to be the player to start to take over for cole as he gets older. at rb theres alzi and ivan, a little short here. Im not sure who is on the market for RB's so I cant say if it is the time to buy a RB. As far as strikers go, if we end up sending Schurrle for KDB and cash, then I would go with a team looking like this
             -Cech_
Alzi  -  Terry   -   Cahill/Ivan  -   Alzi
          Luiz  -  M'villa
Mata/Moses  -          Hazard/Oscar
       Ba/Torres  Schurrle/Lukaku

I agree that Torres cant cut it as a first choice striker, but he netted over twenty this season, scoring a lot in Europe league play. I think he can come in as a third choice behind Ba and Schurrle and hopefully create a partnership with Lukaku that will let the team works through torres while Lukaku gets his feet under him.",0,1370079791,null,0,false,0,caa16h4,t3_1fenfm,t1_caa16h4,t1_ca9rxpj,null,1430963464,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

* Repressed minority. The Kurdish are often targeted by government laws (see here for more info http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey)

They don't exactly say that. They say the states with the highest per capita internet access have seen reduced incidences of (reported) rape, and v.v. And since porn is the second most popular thing people use the internet for (after shopping), that must be the reason.

They go on to point out that correlation isn't causation, but then they spoil it by saying ""it might just be coincidence"". It clearly isn't coincidence, so they are basically saying correlation *is* causation.

The reality is that correlation doesn't have to be either causation or coincidence. There are underlying reasons that some states have better internet access than others - they are wealthier, more densely populated etc - and these things can also affect crime levels.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"I agree with what you're saying and frankly I'm glad I'm taking to a Chelsea fan not blinded by romantic views of our players and one that understands squad building.

The only difference in playing 4-2-2-2 I see is playing 2 wingers or playmakers and 2 dedicated strikers. Rather than 1 striker and 1 false 9 which is more or less what 4-2-3-1 tries to give us. I'm not saying we should make 4-2-2-2 our choice formation but that we should be able to rotate to it and use it to play a more direct game that would challenge opponents with something different if we're failing to break through.

Tactically I see our only weakness at the back in pace if we move Luiz forward. This was plain to see most at Sparta Prague. Their 2 strikers were always looking to run past our 2 CB's and latch on to balls over the top. This happened so frequently even when there were other better passing options and it was clearly part of their game plan. This pace at CB is something that definitely needs to be sorted if we play Cahill, Terry and Ivan. That's why I suggest we buy another CB, not that the others are not good enough.

I also believe that Ivan has made great inroads into being a solid RB, he actually tries and knocks the ball round other opposing LB's. The reason I say we need a CB is also because I'd be comfortable playing Ivan RB as he gives us a different style of RB than AzpiDave. He would be more grounded but Dave has really established himself this season. Young Wallace may be a good RB and we'll have to wait and see with him, so I'd say I'm more happy with RB than I am with CB.

As for LB, I just think we need another young player ready to come in when Cole leaves to be rotated with Bertrand, particularly if tactics dictate we need Bertrand as a defensive winger. Shaw would be ideal, although perhaps not until the season Cole announces his retirement or an intention to leave.

Now to M'vila. He is a different kind of DM IMO, as he is more of an anchor. Granted he's far better at it than Mikel and stronger too. But, I don't think we'd be able to get him off Anzi this season. I wanted us to get him last season and now he's been forced out to Russia. I agree we need another Anchor and to sell Mikel but I can't see many finished articles available. I'd rather have Romeu moulded into an Anchor as he could play his deep passing game from there easier and it would necessitate less of a Gundogan or Modric coming deep for the ball and working on being progressive slightly further forward.

Equally if we play a 4-2-3-1, I don't see the need for an anchor as you can rotate 2 defensively minded progressive players for sitting back. We tried to do this with Luiz and Lampard under Benitez, and I credit him for it. It is an efficient and logical tactic. Think, we could have both Gundogan and Modric doing this.

Although, under Benitez, the tactic may need a defensive winger as if both of them attacked and Ramires was playing wide, he would drop more central, and I'm less keen on this.

Striker wise, when playing 2 up top, that makes complete sense for next season but I'm trying to suggest something that would be perfect and would, barring remarkable progress from Emenalo and De Visser, take many seasons. I realise in this respect that M'Vila makes a great target and we should work on that really but it probably won't be this season.

Back on the Striker topic, I would rather have young players as back-ups than someone who burns a hole in your pocket and will probably complain all the time. Ba/Lukaku and Shürrle would probably work well but I see him as being a winger in a 4-2-2-2. It seems like the good old fashioned striker partnership is dead but I would like to see a good old target man and poacher being used for direct play. What I mean by that is someone like Drogba or another big strong guy, not trying to do it all himself but bring in another player to finish the job, like Hernandez, to finish from anywhere. If the big Lew goes to Bayern then we may be able to pick up Gomez as a guy who can finish from anywhere.

Personally, with our resources and reputation I see no reason not to build an ideal squad capable of being able to play different ways.

2. Zenit: Felt like there was 20 minutes or so where we needed 1 goal to pull off the miracle come back.  After the whistle blew, I felt so uplifted by the event, even though we lost.  It was a truly special performance that lifted the fans into old emotions of european magic and left us hungry for more. 

3. West Ham:  Simply put: this was the first game in a while where we had shown some grit to hammer out a result (pardon the pun).  I remember after this game, thinking Rodgers was starting to really change the mentality of the team.

honorable mention: Newcastle, not because of the goals, but because it showed the fans and the players that we are not a one man team in the slightest. It also showed the huge difference between the pre-january team and post-january team: our team before Sturridge and Coutinho (and the rise of downing/henderson/enrique's form) would have NEVER gotten 6 goals without Luis Suarez.",0,1370083709,null,0,false,0,caa1kx4,t3_1fght4,t1_caa1kx4,t3_1fght4,null,1430963275,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

But when we go to the polls we aren't choosing between Cameron, Clegg, Miliband or Farage, you don't see their names anywhere. You get to vote for the **parties**. The queen then invites that *de facto* head of the winning party to form a government. Indeed there is nothing to stop parties arbitrarily changing prime-minister mid term as Blair/Brown did.

The danger is people will get sucked in by Clegg or Farages better public speaking skills (and I even understand Miliband has had regular practise sessions over the last couple of years in preparation!). Farage in particular comes across as an honest but firebrand politician that could really sweep people towards UKIP much like Salmond did for the SNP. However, denying Farage that opportunity would be a low blow and little more that stifling democracy.

There used to be a thriving market, but for some reason the council decided to displace it and put a bandstand there instead.

So now it is charity shops, bookies, arcades, cash converters, and empty units. Take your pick as to which is better. It isn't the charity shops which killed the place, it is the big supermarkets and out of town shopping centres.

Edit: Here's the *second* paragraph of UKIP's energy policy

&gt;Brussels is demanding...

&gt; “Climate Change” is so last-century

The scientific illiteracy is appalling. They also think because the USA, China, India and the EU emit more emissions we need not bother ourselves. The graph they use is %global emissions, now which of the countries/entities above have a higher population than the UK? The USA with 300,000,000 citizens is almost 3x our population.

&gt;  The EU likes to “lead on climate change”, but no one else is following.

As though the EU could force other countries if it wanted to.

&gt; How Brussels drives up energy costs

Yawn, evil Brussels

&gt; We believe that the market should play a key role in the selection of technologies in this (and other) industries

Young Boys (Away): The 3-5 win was one of the more thrilling we've had this season in my mind. Back and fourth action that really showcased most of the second team (Wisdom and Shelvey notably).

Zenit (Home): Probably the most inspirational performance of the year. When Suarez was preparing for his second free kick goal, I had to put my laptop to the side because I told myself if he got it, I'd jump up out of my seat so fast in celebration that the computer would go flying. So that was definitely the most exciting goal for me all season as well.

Newcastle (Away): Obviously it has to be there. Like others have said, it was fantastic to see what we could accomplish even without our best player. Sometimes watching this sport is hard, really stresses me out (losses at Oldham, Stoke, and Aston Villa), but that was the easiest game to watch. Pure joy from start to finish.

There used to be a waiver for business rates if the shop was empty but that's now gone (a good decision imo) so owners desperately need someone to be in their property. Hence the explosion of charity shops. The landlord is happy and the charity gets a cheap high street shop. 

Now couple this with the completely ignored commercial property boom (it's just as bad if not worse than the overpriced residential market) plus the fact that lots of investors have commercial property in their portfolio. A lot of attention is on BTL but the exact same thing happened to commercial property. So there is now a stalemate where the prices of commercial property are stubbornly high, so a new business can't buy a shop with a flat on top or even just afford to rent.

Try more like £25-£30/week in the middle of winter, possibly more if you're stuck in council housing with storage heaters rather than central heating.  Averaging that over the year will probably bring it down to £20/week for both fuels assuming you have no debt to repay.  I'm assuming you'd like more than just one room to be above 15^o C so you don't have to deal with mold and damp and all the health issues they bring.  Energy costs went up around 10% last year, and will probably do the same again this year.  Benefits will rise 1%.

£20 a week for 21 meals?  That's 95p a meal, so you're basically talking beans on toast for most of them or at best a diet that consists of the same four or five meals endlessly recycled.  My shopping for four people for one hot/main meal a day comes to between £60 and £100 for a week or for 28 meals depending on what I've got left in the freezer, so lets split the difference and call it £75 for 25 meals, the majority from the value range of ingredients but still includes vegetables etc.  That's a more realistic £3 for a main meal.  Even cutting that back to £2/meal brings the weekly shopping budget for 21 meals to £40/week or £160/month.  Remember we're talking three square meals a day.

That changes your figures to £80 for fuel, £160 for food shopping which has wiped out your additional £100/month 'for whatever' and put you £20 in the hole every month. If you've been hit by the bedroom tax you've also got to find that extra £15 a week from somewhere or risk being evicted.  You also forgot the TV license fee and water rates by the way. Water is hard to estimate since it depends on your supplier and if you are metered or rated but my daughter's bill is around £12/week for a four person household, so we'll call it £4 per person per week.  The TV license is around £12/month.  That takes our total up to £350, or £50 more than yours, which I'm assuming is based on JSA payments of £75ish a week.  

So you are then in the position on having to cut back on things that you can't really cut back on.  If you want three meals a day you use less gas and keep the heating off, if you want to be warm you eat one meal a day.

It'll take exactly one minor disaster like the Jobcenter forgetting to pay you or the washing machine breaking down to royally screw you.

This has caused another problem, which is that this state of things costs more money and there are various solutions being proposed for this.

The solutions which involve us going back to the older states of being i.e. earlier deaths or people dying in poverty or working up until a great age despite suffering from infirmities can be said to be regressive because they in some sense retrace our footsteps.

The idea of tying ourselves down to a dwindling resource seems entirely regressive in my eyes, when the only way to make progress is to invest heavily in renewable sources of power. This is largely for 2 main reasons:

1. Fossil fuels are running out around the world, the current viable options are either nuclear or renewable sources (we're a windy island, tidal and wind energy just makes sense.)

2. Cutting our dependence on foreign suppliers for fuel. The major regions for exporting fossil fuels are also some of the most unstable, meaning one of our major sources of fuel to support our country is incredibly unstable at the best of times.


On top of this their push for a larger armed forces seems fairly regressive in worldview too, we're not a major global power that we once were and we don't have the resources to support something like that.

These were peaceful protests which have become violent as a response to police brutality. 

The Turkish demonstrators have JUSTIFICATION for non-peaceful protest because they are acting in self defence. 

In the UK we have freedom of the press, freedom of assembly etc. We have the means to pursue change through democratic and peaceful means. 

It would be a MASSIVE INSULT to those people fighting for the basic freedoms that we enjoy to ignore or rights and the responsibilities that go with them. They are fighting for what we HAVE. 

It's not just about the park... 

* Government forcing through laws, such as bans on the sale of alcohol with little or no consultation or democratic process. 

* Police brutality, including attacks on peaceful protesters 

* Gezi park is NOT JUST a park. It is one of the few green spaces left in Istambul, it is where people rally for demonstrations, it is where people come to be away from buildings during earthquakes. 

* Allegations of corruption in the sale of land and awarding of construction contracts, the perception that Turkey is being sold off to rich foreigners at the expense of the population. 

* Hundreds of political prisoners, Journalists, Kurdish activists etc. 

* Gov. plans to build a new bridge across the Bosphorous named after 'Selim the Grim' an Ottoman ruler who massacred Alevis. Alevis are a religious minority  comprising about 10% of the Turkish population. 

* AKP ruling party control of the media. 

*  Some people are 'Kemalists' (supporters of the nationalistic ideals of Kemal Attaturk, the man credited with 'secularising' Turkey. They tend to favour strong military rule as a bulwark against Islamist parties. They are having a resurgence now as people are growing wary of the AKP turning the democracy established after the ending of Military rule in to an Islamist authoritarian regime. In the 90s anti-gov. protests were routinely cited by the AKP as being in support of military coups. As the AKP has become more authoritarian more people are more sympathetic with the Kemalist view point.  

This is NOT just about the park, the park is the symbol for tensions that have been brewing for a LONG time. 

You have the freedom to peacefully demonstrate without getting beaten or tear gassed, you can turn on the radio or watch TV news and *expect* to hear the government being criticised, you have the means to oppose government policy peacefully.

true,anonDUK,null,null,"Consultants probably do less private work for two main reasons; firstly their pay is sufficient to not need supplementing and secondly by the time they can do private work comfortably (several years into consultancy) most have children and real life commitments so would rather have their time. Getting into private work properly is also fairly complicated I believe, and requires serious research and setup.

Pay banding is the system for calculating pay for overtime and anti-social hours. Most junior and middle grades work habitually long hours at anti-social times (theoretically up to 48 per week... but in reality most I know are doing closer to ~55). Rather than pay overtime, a complex system of 'pay banding' is used. How this works is everyone gets a basic rate of pay based on a normal fulltime (38 hour) week. Then, that gets multipled by a banding based on the anticipated number of hours they will do. The most common are;

* 1A: 50% extra pay (this is what I get as an FY1, so my £24K basic x 1.5 = £36K take home)
* 1B: 40% extra pay
* 1C: 20% extra pay
* Unbanded: 0% extra pay
* There is also a '2' which is 100% extra pay. These used to be very common, but these days they're fairly rare.

Unbanded jobs tend to be those 8am-5pm jobs with no antisocial hour commitments - for example office based work like public health, or psychiatry where there is no need for an FY1 on call, and the workload is usually lighter so they almost always finish on time.

I don't really know that much about locum work as FY1s can't do locum shifts, but I know a lot of hospitals have pushed towards setting up their own bank staff to recruit internally rather than paying for external agency locums. That probably hasn't reduced the amount they can earn for each shift, but it has reduced the number of shifts they can get. Remember, locuming is a bit like being a substitute teacher... you're well paid when you're there, but you can't garuntee they will need you tomorrow so there could be a lot of unpaid downtime. This is probably why most do it (so they can earn enough to live on, while having more time for other things).

I was hoping to do one for every year, but I've got a mind blank for 1994, 1996, ~~1997~~, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2006, ~~2007~~, and ~~2012~~.

I'll try add to that later.",0,1370099471,null,0,1370115107,0,caa3srk,t3_1fgnxs,t1_caa3srk,t3_1fgnxs,null,1430962230,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6
true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"To be honest, I feel as though now is the opportune moment to move him on. He's played a lot games this season (against low grade opposition without getting an amazing ration). If we get to the semi-final of the CL as a realistic target next season then he won't receive anywhere near as much playing time and Ba won't be cup tied.

Lukaku might well stay and be the new top Drog. In which case Torres might find himself being 3rd choice and not playing much and scoring even less. This would make clubs even less inclined to buy him. I feel he will have to go now, or go later for almost nothing or even not go at all and cost us buckets until his contract runs out.

Running 2 up front can cause a problem for the opposition, particularly in Europe I believe, teams such as Juve, with 3 at the back may find it unusual and struggle or have to adapt and change their tactic to an unfamiliar one giving us an advantage. In the PL the tactic could be used against the more physical sides. It would be perfect timing to run 2 up top. Many teams are transitioning to 1 up top or have already done so, this is also what their defensive drilling will be on. And with Pulis gone I think there will be another 1 man up top team. If we were to ruin that with 2 up top we could cause a lot of confusion in defences just with positioning. Particularly if we try and play 2 technically gifted centre forwards (such as Lew) close together. Gomez isn't quite as great on the ball but his finishing is only bested by Van Persie IMO.

If we're playing 4-2-2-2 the roles would be roughly the following I guess: Standard back 4. 2 CDM (one anchor, one transitional passer or 2 transitional rotating as one stays slightly further back). 2 Wingers, I mean wingers, aiming to go out wide, cut in from the byline or cross to Lukaku or through ball behind their back line, eg, Hazard, Shurrle, Moses. And 2 strikers, at least one big strong guy and one poacher. Lukaku and Gotze or Ba.

Alternatively, you could play With 2 wing backs and 2 CAM's with relatively free roles who are expected to contribute in pressing. So for this we may want Ash or Bertie, and Azpi or Wallace/Ivan. Then the CAM's can interweave and if necessary feed to the big guy to bulldoze the CB's or a through ball to a poacher in the box.

Now ramires fits into this when we want to play a 4-2-2-2 but have to be aware of the opposition countering. Ramires would be employed as a defensive winger. Expected to run up and down the wing at all times. The same with Bertie and contribute crosses as well as counter-attacking runs on the break. I expect him to thrive here. They would still have the security of 2 FB. Basically that's a 4-4-2 with them involved, but personally I've never seen the 4-4-2 as a bad tactic, boring but solid. If Juve were to have large amounts of possession we'd probably want at least one defensive winger and one CAM. This would then allow transitioning to a 4-1-2-1-2 or 4-1-2-2-1 in defence, with the poacher dropping wider and deeper and the CAM on the other side. The defensive winger, dropping deeper and more centrally, like Rami, and the more defensive CM, like Luiz, dropping deeper, whilst Lampard or Modric stays ahead. (Added Note at the bottom the Oscar and his defensive possibilities and what it means for Rami)

Basically, we would be able to play most tactics and Rami, definitely still has a role to play. In CM he would be useful as a Box to Box guy when we're really offensive with a 4-2-2-2 partnered with a transitional CM. With Lamps on the ball he would be expected to be ahead of the play and in defence he would be expected to be behind Lamps. He would be our Milner in the sense of being able in CM and RM.

Although if you mean where would Rami be in the starting 11, he probably wouldn't be if everyone was fit and we're facing a team that doesn't worry us that much. Although if they really don't worry us then he may be used in the B2B role I mentioned, although I think Luiz is better there, they may have a pacey striker and we need to play Luiz at the back to guard them countering from our possession stranglehold. I wouldn't say Rami could be the dedicated CDM as he gets too agressive when tasked with that job and should just be in a position where he's expected to contribute.


ADDED Note:

Rami's position in the squad, mainly comes under threat from Oscar's versatility. In most of the roles mentioned, Oscar can be just as effective, although not as quick on the break, he is far more useful with the ball at his feet. He is also a great tackler. In his first CL game, he was given a more defensive role, marking Pirlo, which he did very well. He was also able to contribute to attacks as well. I feel as though he would be able to contribute defensively as a defensive winger or RM and be able to rotate into the 4-1-2-1-2/4-1-2-2-1 easily and more reliably than Rami and he also doesn't have the same temperament. Equally it is Oscar's allround defensive ability that may stop him being the CM/RM in these tactics. He may well be the CAM of choice instead as he will be able to contribute more to the defensive phase, and it may well depend on how creative the DLP/DM of the opposing team is. Overall, I can see Rami not being needed in 1 or 2 seasons depending on how well the squad is structured but he's still needed for the moment.

i used to use £5ish a week on electric and £5 gas a week when i was living on my own in a flat using pay meters. during the winter, i wear more clothes. £40pcm utilities. water is £260ish for the entire household for the year. 

sample weekly food shop:


5 tesco value soups £1.25


Loaf of bread £1.00


soy sauce £1.00


bunch of bananas (8) £1.37


whole chicken £4.16 (biggest spend, easy to replace for cheaper)


5 pouches tesco value cous cous £2.48


2 tins of value tuna £1.60


packet of sphagetti £0.19


pack of apples (7) £1.40


1kg mixed veg £0.75


1kg carrots £1.00


750g bran flakes £0.88


4 pints milk £1.29


15 eggs £1.34


1kg rice £0.40


total = £19.88

dinner = roast chicken 1 night. left overs fried with rice next. all dinners have side portion of mixed veg. either egg fried rice, or tuna pasta. soy sauce for flavour.

lunch: packet of cous cous.  

snacks: apple, banana, raw carrot.

breakfast, one bowl of bran flakes with milk.

thatll leave 7 eggs and half a loaf of bread to play with. i like boiled egg with toast.

should be left with about half a kilo of rice and half the spaghetti at the end of the week.

one option is to remove the £4 chicken and use that money to hunt for brilliant discount food items that are substantial.

so. thats £60 pcm utilities (gas/elec/water). £80 food shopping.  £15 internet and £15 phone. £15 miscellaneous.       £170/£284

tv licence isnt necessary (tv programs can be watched online). bedroom tax if subjected to it will reduce £100 surplus to £85.

£85 pcm to do as you please with. 

buy cheeses, booze, new clothes, bus fares, save money, pay creditors. whatever you wish for, basic requirements are met so £85 is disposable.

Music-wise there's a lot to be going at! Someone's already mentioned Queen, and their stuff is just a lot of fun. A lot of the following list may be obvious to you so sorry about that, as you'd not indicated much about what you have and haven't heard of UK rock, Oasis and Motorhead excepted. This is in no way exhaustive, just bands I know and like. I'm also a historian so value giving you a range of bands so you can see the different kinds of rock that we've put out. I'd recommend:

* **Led Zeppelin** - There are so many great songs, including [Bron-Y-Aur Stomp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i9x3SFjjV4), [Babe I'm Gonna Leave You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axWDbh8r-Mc), and [When The Levee Breaks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOEQTJV_3-w).
* **Black Sabbath** - Famously led in their earlier years by Ozzy Osbourne. [Paranoid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQBttKoetqo) is a classic (both song and album).
* **David Bowie** - Just released a new album, but most of his stuff is pretty awesome. If you're going for one album, it would be [*Ziggy Stardust* and the Spiders from Mars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOPLt_m5o-0)* - IMO the title track and Suffragette City are two great ones from this.
* **Fairport Convention** - Major leaders in the UK's folk-rock movement in the 60s and 70s. *Liege &amp; Lief* is the best album to start with; [Matty Groves](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD3F93v1Tdc) is a good cut.
* **Prog Rock** - Lots of bands for this - Yes, Genesis, Procol Harum, etc. I like Yes' [Owner of a Lonely Heart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecuksod41Qk), which has Trevor Horn's amazing production. Muse are firmly in this tradition, IMO.
* **Dire Straits** - Amazing band, especially guitarist Mark Knopfler's playing. [Money For Nothing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwDDswGsJ60) is my personal favourite, but [Sultans of Swing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo-J1wf2KHc) is another great song.
* **The Clash** - Started off as punk but by *London Calling* were putting out music that was an amazing mix of all kinds of influences: rock, punk, reggae, ska, dub, everything. Go for *London Calling*: the [title track](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lotkzHsIuoA) is incredible.
* **The Stone Roses** - Manchester based band, recently reformed. [Love Spreads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=852fIw_I84I).
* **P J Harvey's** *Let England Shake* - 2011 Mercury Prize winner. Little out of place with the rest of these but if you want to understand a lot about what it is to be English at the moment listen to the lyrics very carefully. I don't follow contemporary music much but this is a must listen. [The Words That Maketh Murder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2tGhWVMc2E) and [The Last Living Rose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4gSzkkOZO0) are both excellent tracks.

true,strummist,eu,Kent,"The National Trust run some terrific campsites in the Lake District.


A good itinerary might be to arrive by train at Windermere and get the ferry along the lake to Ambleside - from there it's not far to Low Wray campsite by Windermere:

http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/holidays/camping/camping-in-the-lake-district/low-wray/

It's very handy because it's an easy, lowland walk to the site which is nice after a long train ride. (or, you could get the bus)

Low Wray is perfect for families with small children and you'd do well just staying there, but I usually go from there to Great Langdale - another easy lowland walk. 

http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/holidays/camping/camping-in-the-lake-district/great-langdale/

I usually spend a couple of days there then head over the pass to the more remote Wasdale Head.

http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/holidays/camping/camping-in-the-lake-district/wasdale/

Each of these sites costs about a tenner per person per night, and they have hot showers and dryers.

I mean this in the way you will see Rooney in a trequartista role, looking to come deep and get the ball rather than leading the line and contributing a lot to passing moves. Occasionally dropping even deeper to a midfield role or even getting the ball of the defence. When Wellbeck is used alongside RVP then he is more an Inside Forward in the way we tried to use Sturridge and the way we will probably use Shurrle. 

As for City, they played Tevez in a deeper role than he used to, often slightly behind Aguero. Although it is true that this is more of a case of 2 strikers they are not working as 2 out and out strikers together but 1 supporting and one leading. The season summary wikipedia page for Man City shows Tevez listed as in a Secondary Striker position, the positional name being hyper-linked to its definition, described as not quite being a Trequartista. More a number 9.5/10 who still scores but does tend to sit behind another.

Ok, now, to what we mean by 2 strikers in a 4-2-2-2 is 2 strikers who attempt to lead the line rather than sit behind another. Two who are supportive whilst playing alongside each other rather than staggered.

You're not wrong, but I think you're misunderstanding the attributes needed in this form of a 2 striker partnership. We already play a player in the Trequartista's area/position but as a playmaker who is not really expected to score that many. That person is Mata, although he has indeed scored quite a lot from this position. So, this is a different type of strike partnership to that which you are referencing.

EDIT: I saw this in my replies inbox and thought you were referencing the 4-2-2-2 formation and the use of 2 strikers. I agree that it's suitable but hardly the best, and hardly better than the 2 teams that finished above us. Torres is clearly a weaklink and Ba hasn't had enough regular games IMO. Lukaku should be first choice but when it comes to 3 day rotation I wouldn't say we have an impact player or a suitable youth striker or well anybody that adds another facet to our game up front. Ba is a bit of a poacher but I haven't seen enough of him in a blue shirt and Torres is a bit of a (downvote anticipating) zombie. Also quite often you will see either Manchester team using an attacking midfielder instead of a trequartista such as Yaya in an attacking role or Kaguwa (sp?) although I believe he's been more utilised on the wing but a CAM position would suit him better.",0,1370103183,null,0,1370104305,0,caa4oup,t3_1fenfm,t1_caa4oup,t1_caa47t3,null,1430961810,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Saying ""you'll need/want to use the NHS when you're old, so you should support it now"" is nonsense. If you're being forced to pay for it all your life, of course you have every right to use it when the time comes that you need it. Just because you don't agree with the system doesn't mean you shouldn't get what you're paying for. If there was no NHS, that money you used to pay in taxes could have been saved, or you would have paid for insurance, so it's perfectly acceptable to make use of the service that you paid for.

People who bring out these BS arguments about people who want a smaller welfare state using the welfare state when they need it manage to completely miss the point. It's either a welfare state, or more money in your pocket. Since they've taken the money out of your pocket already, you *have* to use the welfare state.

So yes, intangible-tangerine suggesting that people's political opinions will shift when they ""have recourse to use the NHS"" (and that people who don't appreciate the NHS only do so because they don't need it) is an invalid argument.

Not true. I don't follow rugby myself but I know those who do who *hate* the lack of recognition given to the NI contribution to the Irish team. 

The ultimate insult being when the IRFU judged Belfast as being an 'Away venue' when the Irish team hosted Italy at Ravenhill, in order to avoid playing the NI anthem.

Obviously rugby developed differently to football but if there is to be a model for North/South cooperation at sport rugby is most definitely not it.

And apart from your assumption being incorrect, the fact is an awful lot of people here take pride in a team and sport that for once is not based in England or Dublin but here in OWC - why would we throw that away for another plastic Irish team?

There was a time when bookshops were not even allowed to compete on price, so if you had a good location, good customer service and a decent selection of books you would probably do OK. Now they have to compete with supermarkets and Amazon selling books dirt cheap, ebooks, plus the fact that less people read now because there are so many other forms of entertainment.

It just seems like the people who buy books from Oxfam are probably doing it as an alternative to using the library. The sort of people who buy books from bookshops probably wouldn't want a dog-eared second hand copy from Oxfam.

ECHR?  Yes, the UK should be able to deport people who actively campaign to have British people killed/terrorised.  Anything positive in the ECHR could always be put into a second UK Bill of Rights.  Refugees?  We certainly have some commitment but the UK is in the NorthWestern corner of Europe.  They're a refugee when they first appear in a European country where they're not at risk.  Most have to travel through a lot of countries before remembering to claim refugee status.

&gt;*Or, real questions about their want to dissolve the Ministry of Defence and completely reform it and add to our military strength when most people really don't like our interventionist policies.*

The Ministry of Defence is ridiculously heavy on civil servants, and runs costly procurement.  The civil service needs to be gutted - and UKIP was and is opposed to interventionist policies.  It was against occupation of Iraq, Afghanistan, intervention in Mali or Libya.  It is against intervention in Syria.  If most people don't like interventionist policies you should love them.

Consecutive governments have been pro-intervention but sent troops out without the proper equipment.  UKIP's policy is the reverse.  Make sure they do have the right equipment by taking spending back to early 90s levels, but to not get involved in interventionism that doesn't concern the UK.

&gt;*Also, an attempt by Farage to seriously defend his parties disagreement that climate change exists[1] would be nothing other than cringe worthy.*

UKIP advocates putting it, the strategies eployed, the energy policy, the effects to change, to an independent Royal Commission.  To put the Green strategy in the dock.  If Green subsidies are not achieving results, if they are making energy more expensive, if they're not changing the environment - then you can have all the windfarms you want.  The government just won't be subsidising them.

Ask UKIP about the environment and it won't be long before they're talking about cheaper energy bills and lowering emissions by using nuclear.   If you go to page 15 of the pdf you linked you'll see they have some very clear simple points that will be a simple sell.  Lower fuel bills and real austerity savings without cutting into people's pockets are compelling.

Ask them that question and they'll point out that lobbyists and politicians have set a green agenda but science has been addressed as to whether the 'solution' really is one or not, or whether the UK can actually make any real changes.  That they'll take this assumption and political agenda and put it under scientific trial through a Royal Commission.

&gt;*An opportunity to actually question UKIP on their policies would be excellent, because most people don't know how stupid they are.*

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"It is not as bad because this is a Chelsea subreddit and we all talk on the same subject. If someone is wrong about the subject another who better understands it can point it out easily. This in term improves the community over the long term where people who are more knowledgeable improve those who are not. Even though what you are talking about does happen, it still is so much less than what happens on a sub like /r/Soccer.

Now /r/Soccer has fans from all over the world, most of which are very badly equipped about their own team let alone others. This is worsened by the fact that the learners absorb the popular opinions like they are facts.

Unlike a team subreddit like /r/Chelseafc or /r/Reddevils where you can even know top knowledgeable people by their username, this does no exist on /r/Soccer as much and this cycle continues until people who have never watched a game of Bundesliga apart from the Champions League games think Dortmund players are the best in the world etcetera. Now a knowledgable person might come in and try to explain them that this is wrong but that then goes against the hive mind.  That person is either down voted or ignored because it simply does not follow the popular (mostly incorrect) opinion. In the meantime 50 more people will absorb this wrong opinion instead of listening to that one guy who goes against the hivemind and actually knows what he is talking about only worsening the effect.

I guarantee you no team subreddit is as bad as /r/Soccer (/r/Gunners gets close due to the biggest fan base and so many new fans - They have 3-4 different subreddits about just Arsenal due to this) because they can in term teach each other about one subject. However the problem with /r/soccer cannot be fixed and will get much worse as more people join and there is nothing anyone can do about it. It is basic psychology.

This is why I posted that reason above specifically for /r/Soccer and not for a team subreddit. Their ""lists"" and ""predictions"" like the one OP posted always give me a good laugh.

Comparing the flag of the former government (which is known to have treated Catholics as second-class citizens - a fact that many people who adore that flag are proud of) to shamrocks and the Celtic cross (which have never represented any kind of official force against the protestant community) is a little facetious.

I do actually follow rugby and I'm from a unionist community and I have never once in over 10 years of playing and following the sport heard anyone voice any animosity for the Ireland team or how we are presented on it. The people who voice those concerns are either constantly looking for reasons to protest or you have pulled that out of your ass. Either way, you have nowhere near enough evidence to render my observation (not assumption) incorrect.

You also demonstrate your incredible novice grasp of rugby if you think Ireland is only there to make up numbers or contribute to the same level as the Irish football team. We have had great showings in the past, and regularly.

Your average Italian club has more gifted midfielders than Parker just sitting around on the bench.

But my point is Farage doesn't believe he's a libertarian in the sense of ""scrap nulcear weapons, disband the army, tax polluting vehicles and introduce a VAT cut on sandals and hemp"". That is very much the US meaning being extrapolated onto british politics. Instead he means he doesn't believe in authoritarianism (so small state, most decisions made by local gov, minimal intervention in peoples home lives etc.)

A good example would be something like the European Working Time Directive. Farage would almost certainly believe it is up to the individual to decide how many hours they want to work in a week, and that it should not be dictated and policed by the state (or in this case a supra-national body). In his mind, he is de-restricting workers to do whatever they want and freeing the state from its nanny role.

I actually am *great* at dressing on a budget.  Less thrift stores (British equivalent would be charity shops, by the way), and more just knowing exactly when every shop I like will be starting their sales.  Right now, for example, I am wearing a very cute key printed dress that was reduced from £40 to £15 ($60 to $22 ish if you're not that hot on the conversion), on which I have been complimented plenty.  I don't think I've ever paid full price for clothing, unless it was from somewhere like Primark, which is super cheap anyway.

Books too, and I read a *lot* of books, I buy second hand all the time.  I get two brand new ones a year, one for my birthday, and one for Christmas.

Their connection goes all the way back to The Honourable East India Company of the Opium Wars in China. Study the powerful House of Keswick connection to the HSBC. Hong Kong is the heroin trade capital of the World. The West is flooded with heroin from the Golden Triangle (reason why the CIA started the Vietnamese war) and Golden Crescent (part of the Middle East crusade).

Most of the opium enters first into Europe via Sicily commanded by the powerful House of Bourbon headed by Jesuit-trained King Juan Carlos of Spain. France plays a massive role in the opium processing and this ties in with the powerful House of Savoy a ruler of the World Society who thieve natural resources. The CIA/DVD use by proxy the Japanese Yakuza in California to flood the West Coast with heroin whilst they use the corrupted Chinese Te-Wu division of the Er-Bu based in Chicago to flood the East Coast. A lot of the funds from the drugs trade go into the secretive Exchange Stabilization Fund. The drugs trade is a secret economy five times the size of the visible economy of the World. The Afghanistan war was not about oil, a barrel of oil does not compare in value to a barrel of opium.

The role of the military intelligence networks is to protect the economy at all costs. The role is not what you imagined. Military intelligence are the main players in the drugs trade for the elite families like Matheson, Astor, Dent, Bourbon, Savoy, Swire, Rothschild, Sassoon, Baring and Keswick etc. British MI6 are the masters of the heroin trade along with the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst. The Cocaine trade is mastered by the DVD/CIA for MI6. Israeli Mossad are the masters of the Ecstasy trade for MI6. The North Korean, Ministry of State Security and DVD master the amphetamines. The role of banks like the HSBC is to clean up the drugs money laundered through the stock exchanges of the World.

The House of Bourbon master the entire drugs trade with the House of Savoy through The Worshipful Company of Apothecaries part of the pirates of the Livery known as the British Empire hiding behind veils like the City of London Corporation. Some of the best exposers of the intelligence drugs trade are Brian Downing Quig, Gary Webb, Dr John Coleman and Michael Ruppert. The first two men were killed for exposing the truth on the drugs trade.

The first is from 2000 and seems to directly address the question you raise:

&gt;Within the last ten years there has been substantial growth of the charity retailing sector. This increased retail presence and sophistication of marketing practices have led to the contention by mainstream retailers that charity shops, which enjoy specific fiscal arrangements, have an unfair competitive advantage. Utilising evidence from a range of town centre locations, this paper examines whether this allegation can be substantiated. Three sources of primary research are used: the profile of charity shops within a town centre context; the attitudes and perceptions of mainstream retailers and their organisational bodies; and finally, the perspective of town centre managers towards charity retailing. Analysis and subsequent discussion suggests that charity retailers can perform a complementary role within town centres, thus reducing the potential of conflict with mainstream retailing.

The second article looks at the increasing professionalisation of the charity sector, which arguably raises the pressure on mainstream retailers.

&gt;The charity retail format has experienced significant growth over the last 30 years to a situation where charity shops have now become a taken for granted feature of local high streets across the UK. Traditionally charity shops have played an important service role in their local communities by providing low cost goods and employing voluntary staff. However, alongside the growth of the sector, charities have become increasingly professional in their approach to managing their shops. Changes include the introduction of paid managers and shop assistants and an overall ’‘trading up” of the charity retail environment. This paper explores in detail this professionalisation of the charity retail sector. It then examines the impact of this professionalisation on the role of charity shops in their local communities and speculate on the likely future for charity retail in this context.

TV debates have confused it slightly because its new territory, but as I said - I don't like UKIP and I won't be voting for them... but they do have a legitimate concern here, that they will be excluded from the TV debates because none of the ""big three"" established parties particularly wants to make way for a potential 'fourth party' - not least one that might use its lowest common denominator politics to steal votes from them.

This isn't really farage threatening imminent court action, its political posturing - he is laying down a few 'red lines' that essentially he isn't going to sit back and allow UKIP to be excluded from legitimate debates, and if someone trys he will kick up a fuss.

Farage has in effect gained a mandate to be heard by the public in the recent council elections, and will almost certainly again next year in the European parliament elections.

I can't see any reason to exclude a 3rd largest party that is polling at 20% (twice what the lib dems are getting) from a political debate.

Now I guess we play the waiting game to see whether the groundwork for Smith's exiting regeneration gets hinted at during the 50th Anniversary and built-up for Series 8. Christmas Special will undoubtedly sew the seeds for that moment as well.

My guess? Much like how it ""started"" for Smith's Doctor, he'll ""end"" with somehow piecing together River Song's survival of the Library and sacrifice his 11th incarnation to keep her alive. And when 12 comes about River Song won't be able to deal with it and ""leave"" him so 12 can move onto some other odd romantic interest (seems like Moffat's M.O.).

Well now. The reason we don't have a National Service in the armed forces any more is because the professional armed services don't want it and the majority of young people didn't want to serve in the armed forces.

National Service, as was, had all sorts of unfortunate echoes of empire and militarism and nationalism.

If some sort of National Service were brought back whereby people could be drafted to provide service to communities and infrastructure and be paid a basic wage to do the same, receive training in a trade if they so desired then depending on how it was implemented that could be a progressive thing.

&gt;Personally, I think religious ideology and political ideology are both the same type of cancer to independent evaluation.

By this formulation there's no one on Earth that is capable of anywhere near independent evaluation.

For the next few weeks, the internet will be full of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. Angsty Tumblrs will be set up, proclaiming that once Matt Smith goes, they might as well cancel Doctor Who.

Certain long-time fans may start ringing the doom bell claiming that because of [Name of the Doctor](#s ""John Hurt Doctor""), Matt's replacement must therefore be THE FINAL DOCTOR EVER (because a line of dialogue from The Deadly Assassin in the 70s is reason enough to cancel the show). Remember this, because it'll be important in about 3-4 years time when the regeneration limit is ignored in the same way that [UNIT dating is](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/UNIT_dating_controversy).

**THE HATE**

A new actor will be announced. They could be white, black, green, man, woman, space penguin or any combination of the above. Fandom will react as if the BBC had announced that Doctor 12 was being played by a robotic Jimmy Savile being piloted by Hitler's brain. They will froth. They will growl. They will make nasty comments about the new actor's ears.

Cue weeks of people poring over the new guy/gal/penguin's previous career in an attempt to find any reason to hate them. 

Certain old fans will claim that now would be a perfect time to announce that Chris/David/Matt were all actually the Rani (it's not important) masquerading as the Doctor, and that the real Doctor is still Paul McGann, who should be re-hired forthwith. Ignore these people, as they are insane.

**THE BACKLASH**

By about September, we'll all be sick to death of speculation, of Matt Smith being interviewed about his reasons for leaving (he's done three years, three years is the average time for a Doctor, so expect the ""Well David Tennant told me that Peter Davison explained to him that Patrick Troughton had warned him to leave after three years."") and the backlash to the Smith Era will begin. Mis-steps like Night Terrors will be thrown onto giant bonfires, and we'll all start pretending that we hated The Pandorica Opens. 

If the 50th Anniversary episode isn't the best thing since sliced bread, expect the backlash to intensify and people to say things like ""the only good thing that can happen at Christmas is that Matt regenerates before the opening credits."" (Note. This actually popped up in a review for Planet of the Dead, the first episode after David Tennant handed in his notice.)

One or two old fans will claim that the show should be cancelled, and we should all just watch DVDs of ""Time and The Rani"" until the heat death of the universe. WARNING. DO NOT EVER BUY A DVD OF ""TIME AND THE RANI."" IF YOU FIND ONE, BURN IT. DO **NOT** WATCH IT.

**THE ACCEPTANCE**

Christmas will come, Matt will bid us adieu, we'll all remember why we loved him so, before instantly forgetting everything about him as Doctor number 12 blows us away in what amounts to a glorified end-of-episode cameo.

Those angsty Tumblr users from before will create one GIF for every frame that the new Doctor is in, before frotting themselves stupid.

Someone on Outpost Gallifrey will claim not to have watched the regeneration episode anyway, because they prefer to just listen to that Big Finish audio play where Colin Baker has to defeat an impostor pretending to be the real Doctor. They will brand the episode as ""disappointing"" regardless, and award it 2/10 in the voting thread.


The important thing to remember is that this has happened before. Sometimes we've had great Doctors (Pat Troughton, Tom Baker, David Tennant), sometimes we've had fairly average or downright divisive Doctors (Peter Davison, Sylvester McCoy, Christopher Eccleston), but only once have we been lumped with Colin fucking Baker, and those dark days are long behind us. So enjoy the ride, and don't get too upset. 

10 times out of 11, it all turns out OK.


**Obligatory ""Post is now popular"" Edit**

*1 - Here, have some gold!*) Thanks for the gold!

*2 - Why do you hate 6?*) I don't hate Colin Baker. He's my least favourite Doctor, and I exaggerate for comic effect. His televised work is weak (hamstrung by terrible production), but he's superb in the Big Finish audio dramas. I heartily recommend (and allude to) [The One Doctor](http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/the-one-doctor-651).

*3 - You're an idiot! 9/5/etc were amazing!*) I don't hate Eccleston/Davison/Insert Doctor of Your Choice. With all the Doctors, your personal mileage will vary. My personal tastes change depending on what I saw last, but it's always 2, 4 and 8 at the top, 9,7 and 6 at the bottom. There's no ""right"" order.

*4- Y U H8 on Tumblr!?!*) Comic effect. Pull the rod out of your arse.

And let us not forget one of your first entries into this debate. Again, I quote. ""In order to work, one must be paid"" stated here: http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1f9ayq/workfare_two_more_major_retailers_argos_and/ca8fmaa

This implies that the pay must come first. Given that you've not tried to agree with what I've said about work coming first. Ever. I can only assume that you still hold this position to some greater or lesser extent.

As for the idea of working for no pay, it got me a job. Frankly a brief period of employment in which I got a boost to my JSA and when I sat down later and did the math, I learned that I was actually better off on JSA than actually being employed. 

Besides, a thought has struck me. You say work for no pay is bad and so on, but tell me, what is your opinion on a brief period of employment in order to continue receiving benefits?

I'm not gonna lie, I'm biased in favour of the system's principle, although not in how the system is being applied. Then again, I've been unemployed for a significant chunk of my adult life and the Workfare system is ultimately responsible for me getting back on my feet.",0,1370126035,null,0,false,0,caab8aw,t3_1f9ayq,t1_caab8aw,t1_ca8wdjv,null,1430958652,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,7oby,k9,K-9,"&gt;(because a line of dialogue from The Deadly Assassin in the 70s is reason enough to cancel the show).

I'm pretty sure it was also in the [TV movie](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Who_%281996%29), both saying 12 regens (13 lives).

&gt; Both the Doctor (in his narration) and the Master reaffirm that Time Lords can regenerate twelve times. 

In SJA's ""[Death of the Doctor](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Death_of_the_Doctor)"" he claims he can regenerate 507 times.

&gt; The Doctor says he can regenerate 507 times and change to any colour of skin. When the three digits are added together the sum is 12. Later statements by Russell T Davies suggest this was likely a joke. However TV: Let's Kill Hitler would later confirm that skin colour change is possible in a regeneration.

so it seems RTD is saying that it's still 12 regenerations.

I understand why people don't like the flag for political reasons, but those same political reasons keep those people from liking the football team too. You say the Celtic cross has never represented any kind of official (?) force against protestants, presumably you have been missing while the politicisation of Gaelic culture by certain elements of society here has dragged us into the situation where anything can be immediately construed as triumphalism emanating from a section of society. Facetious? Not at all. You simply try to dismiss one complaint and elevate another. Your choice but you can't say you're being even handed.

The flag isn't perfect (which national flag is?) but for me in 2013 I'll choose to associate it with Rory McIlroy, Northern Ireland football and co rather than a parliament that last met in 1972.

Eccleston's story was of the damaged warrior who was never quite comfortable being the Doctor. Tennant's had a great arc of character development - losing Rose, his gradual careening towards power craziness, and the specials which emphasised his loneliness and feeling of having lost too much.

In both instances it felt somehow *right* and appropriate for them to regenerate - as if they'd done what they were supposed to do, and it was a natural time for re-birth. I really don't feel like we've been through a comparable journey with Matt - his character's been fairly consistent, there have been no events which really seem to have shaken him, and there's no sense of his story coming to a close.

I don't mean that as any affront to Matt's acting at all - I think it's been brilliant - but I strongly feel the writing hasn't done him or his fans justice. It simply doesn't feel like he's had a proper life story - he's merely treaded water. There's a general conceit in fiction that plot developments should make sense within the world of the characters, but also in the fiction of the story.

I think however that if an European army was properly integrated and patrolled dangerous boarders to keep the peace (like in Cyprus) then an invading nation would  have to go through the EU army. Military nations would inevitably feel attacked as their soldiers would have been shot at or could have been shot at. I would think an aggressive invasion within the EU would feel like a security threat for military nations anyway. In terms of nuclear defence I don't think a nuclear war would be started over an invasion; conventional forces would be sufficient. Nukes would only be used (I hope :/) against another nuclear country threatening the EU. 

Having said all that it's kind of a fantasy ATM. We're fairly loosely involved with the EU anyway: no €, no schengen, no [CFREU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union) and public antipathy to the EU fueled by misinformation by the Anti-EU crowd and the lack of a united vocal Pro-EU voice. Until people start to try and educate themselves and until the Eurozone crisis cools down and people lose their emotional responses we won't get anywhere near that.

true,Nodules,eng-manchester,Manchester,"&gt; the best episodes were written by Stephen Moffat himself, blink, library of the daleks etc. 

Moffat is excellent at writing single (or two-) episode stories, but when it comes to producing an entire series, he churns out some right bollocks.

For example, River Song. She went from ""*Nice character, I wonder what she's all about?*"" to ""*She's in THIS episode too? Sigh...*"" I understand that he had to introduce the Ponds first (and thus show them having adventures with the Doctor) to give context to River's story, but the looooong gap between series killed off any major excitement in regards to that storyline.

I also dislike the fact that he severely overused the Weeping Angels. They went from ""*Bloody hell, they're frightening!*"" all the way down to ""*They're no threat to the Doctor at all. Moving swiftly on...*""

I reckon Smith would've been right up there with the best of the Doctors if he'd just had a decent writer behind him. The potential **is** there, but the execution was just poor.

Mostly a 4-2-3-1 to accommodate both Suarez and Sturridge. Suarez in is free roaming role, both Coutinho and Aspas with pace, trickery, and vision on the wings cutting inside. Gerrard and Lucas just holding the midfield. If Suarez does leave, we might revert to a 4-3-3 bringing Coutinho into the middle to play the AM role or keeping him at LW and signing an AM like Mikhitaryan or Eriksen (dream). I can see Suso, Wisdom,and Shelvey loaned. It really wouldn't surprise me if BR sold Henderson even after his decent season due to his similarities to Allen and the lack of need for two similar players on the bench. He tried to use Henderson last year to get Dempsey in. Would be a shame really but would not surprise me. Our bench really is quite weak / inexperienced. :/

That aside, I've always thought an amazing doctor back in the day would have been Peter Falk, but he was American.

My votes would have to go to:

1. Hugh Laurie (would be amazing)
2. Chris O'Dowd (I would **LOVE** this!)
3. Idris Elba, if he could be funny.
4. Rowan Atkinson (I don't care if he did it in comedy spinoff)

2. Everything looks pretty bleak with no obvious solution

3. Matt Smith waves the sonic screwdriver or gives an emotional speech about loss and humanity.

4. Everything's fine.

There's no real plot development or progress towards a solution  - everything's fine, then it's bad, then it's fine again. No real journey or difficulty.

Similarly, I'm extremely disappointed with Matt Smith's development as a character - it doesn't really seem like he's progressed through any real personality changes or major personal developments. He doesn't feel any older, wearied or in need of a regeneration, and his death hasn't been foreshadowed. I think his regeneration will be symptomatic of Moffat Who: coming out of nowhere, not making a whole lot of sense, but being shoved under the rug with an overly-emotional speech or two.",0,1370130337,null,0,false,0,caacfax,t3_1fhf0b,t1_caacfax,t1_caaaapm,null,1430958089,35,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,35

As for Hudd, I would love for him to stay at the club but he will want 1st team football and I think it would be unfair to limit his career by keeping him as a sub.

Farage **needs** to breakthrough to mainstream voters to stand a chance of winning seats, and the TV debates are probably his best shot at doing that. If he can stand up in front of an audience, and parley with the public on equal terms to Clegg, Cameron and Miliband that could be a huge boost for UKIP and Farage knows it... just like it was for Clegg last year. 

I would argue that averaging 26% of the vote in the recent county council elections, and next year likely achieving strong results in the European parliament election will give Farage a genuine mandate to be involved in any public discussion. Preventing him from doing so would be to obstruct democracy and deny the public an oppourtunity to make up their own minds (dangerous as that may be).

We already have strict laws to make sure no one party can get all the airtime... all Farage is asking for is UKIPs entitlement to that. Don't get me wrong, I entirely see the appeal in denying UKIP that... but it just isn't how British democracy works. That's how Zimbabwean democracy works.

Can you point to any specific policy of UKIPs that in any way makes them threatening court action over being excluded from a potentially game-changing political debate hypocritical? I cannot see any. None at all. They oppose nanny-statism and excessive beauracracy. Thas what they mean by libertarianism. But this isn't some pathetic nanny-state issue, its a serious threat of censorship against a party that at their last oppourtunity held 26% of the vote...

The difference is, at the recent council elections UKIP polled a pretty astounding 26%... In pre general-election polls they are consistently getting ~20% of the vote if an election were held today, which would put them as the new '3rd party' and push the Lib Dems into fourth by overall share of the vote.

My point is this: There is a slim, but never the less possible, chance that UKIP might actually be a game changing force at the next election - most likely as a coalition forming partner for the conservatives (if UKIP can actually increase their share of the vote enough to start translating those votes into seats). So really UKIP ought to be represented in any national debate with the big 3 parties.

But if we were to include the Green party we would be obliged to include every single 1 seat party, including independents... and in reality those people have very limited influence in parliament since their votes rarely act as deal breakers against the majority power of the ruling party(s).

He's basically become a bumbling idiot who hardly ever figures anything out without it being handed to him on a silver platter. And even then he sometimes ignores it.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"**OK, wall of text warning defending privacy and why you should care about it. Don't read if you don't want but if you, or anyone else, fancies a slight tangent....**

Privacy is quite important. Without wishing to sound like a libertarian (because I'm not one), governments will always tend to treat it's citizens like data points or chess pieces with no rights who can be told what to do. It makes their job easier and it's almost always subconscious and not really their fault. It's simple to run a state in where no-one can sue you and in which you can just do what you want but it becomes a shit place to live. Human rights are supposed to be a huge obstacle to the government but there not there to be overcome; they're there to encourage governments to question what they are doing which they never do. They just question the human rights themselves because it's hard politically to admit you might be wrong so the human rights must be wrong. 

Anyway the point is that it's essential we hang onto the liberties we have because the difficult process of governing means that the government however well intentioned will tend to push to make their job easier and to take them away. 

Louis Brandeis, Supreme Court Judge in America, said it best [in the Harvard Law Review](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html): 

&gt;'The intensity and complexity of life, attendant upon advancing civilization, have rendered necessary some retreat from the world, and man, under the refining influence of culture, has become more sensitive to publicity, so that solitude and privacy have become more essential to the individual.

In other words, as the world becomes more socially connected privacy is going to become a very rare thing and even if you feel like you don't need it now you might regret giving away your privacy later in life. I can always throw out examples: if you get suspected of a crime because the government has connected unconnected dots in your purchasing habits and you lose friends or get your account frozen or something, if a very ideological government takes over and criminalises something previously legal and use that surveillance to effectively watch you and ensure you don't do that thing. 

It's a kind of CCTV-camera-in-your-home, 1984, authoritarian, ideological government combination that gives people nightmares. With unlimited access to your private life and the private life of your children they get a huge array of new ways to screw you if they want to. In a perfect world it would be fine because we would be able to trust the current and all future governments to hold our information safe but in practice we can't really trust the current government and we have no idea who will have it in the future. This may be a cliché but if the BNP won a freak victory in 2016 and Nick Griffon could read your browsing habits, your spending habits and the same of every member your family would you be so blasé about privacy? Would you be worried about buying a book about the positive aspects of immigration in case the BNP came knocking at your door with [the sort of thugs they hug around with in the 1990s?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_18) Very few people, let alone huge associations of people like a government, are completely 100% trustworthy so you have to have limits. 

Combine this also with the fact that government might allow companies to have this information (maybe for a fee or co-operation on another policy) which the company might use to take advantage. If they knew your medical records and tracked your browsing habits to find out you were pregnant, then Amazon could increase the price of all their pregnancy items whenever you browse their site and take the extra profit. This is totally legal and some airline companies do this when you visit their site twice; they will increase the ticket price when you come back as your more likely to buy the second time. Equally if a company can 'look at what porn I look at' then they could prevent you from having a job with them or fire you from an existing job. If all your private information is available to them they could avoid a PR disaster by not hiring the guy who watches amputee midget porn. 

There are 100 ways this could be abused but the main point remains that the privacy you give away today is gone for good and in a world becoming more public and more social by the day you might hugely regret that in 10 years time.

Those events have certainly happened, but they've felt very self-contained - as if they affected the Doctor's circumstances but not him as a person. There just haven't been enough references to key events within the regeneration, long-term developing themes or other changes.

I don't think there's anything that would stop you reading in to his character in the way that you have, but I certainly don't think it's been adequately shown by the show itself. That's particularly the case given that Who characters tend to be exaggerated and larger than life - if you want to show significant change in such a character, subtle implied nuances aren't really sufficient.

I don't think it'll be Rupert Grint. I can see it in a few years but not yet, and it's going to be someone attached to BBC contracts. I like the idea of Ben Whishaw. But I think he's now been in a few major films, whereas he would have been perfect a few years ago. He hates publicity and likes his privacy though, so I seriously doubt he'd agree to take it on. But he's the right age, level of acting skill to be able to pull this off.

For some reason, having noticed the links with Who actors/producers usually working together before (assuming to keep the developments quiet) I keep thinking they were usually seen before in a fairly lavish drama of some sort, and I keep coming back to finding out Clara was cast, and on looking her up thinking oh, she was in dancing on the edge, I remember her now.

It also had other people who have been involved with who - Angel Coulby, Anthony Head. (Which also makes me think of minor characters now merlin's finished, as they were both in this, but I see less connections this way).

Now, I was going to list [Sam Hoare](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2397390/) As he was in Bert and Dickie with Matt Smith, only to find my linking theory sort of plays out because he's already been cast in the TV film about the beginnings of Who for the 50th.

But then, I thought [David Dawson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dawson_%28actor%29). Right age, appropriate level of [acting ability](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwvIBkzopu8) shown while being relatively unknown at this stage, expect that won't last, so Who might be a progression. Oh, also in secret diary of a call girl, just like Matt Smith and obviously Billie Piper.

Also thought of Jack Donnelly from dancing on the edge but googling tells me he's been cast as a main character in a new BBC Merlin replacement, [Atlantis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis_%28TV_series%29). Just reading that bit - a fantasy series with hints of mythology almost confirms for me I'll fall in love with that show. I bet that's what's on in the huge doctor who gap, it always used to cycle between merlin and doctor who before.

So basically, that was who I was thinking of from a likely connected show, but I also think perhaps [Andrew Gower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gower_%28actor%29) though he's a little too young I think, but I know Gatiss is [very aware](http://annreggie.tumblr.com/post/21133874794/i-said-to-andrew-gower-i-just-got-an-idea-i) of him and Gatiss seems to be becoming more and more important in the writing of Who.

Also from being human, [Damien Molony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Molony). I quite like the idea of him as the Doctor, but I wonder if they wouldn't go for it because of his [non kid friendly role](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqZ-2XECSoo) he's well known for. But now Being Human has finished, I can't help thinking it'd be good timing for a new large role. But I think that might be wishful thinking.

Also think [Harry Lloyd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Lloyd) is possible still, considering how much some people thought he'd be 11. Right age, right career stage.

Wow, this was too much. My brain is busy finding connections and nerdgasming, obviously.

**tl;dr** Probably completely wrong, but actors who might be tenuously connected to Who and at the right stage include David Dawson, Andrew Gower though maybe too young, Harry Lloyd is a possibility again but I'd love it to be Damien Malony, and I see Ben Whishaw as quite unlikely but would be excellent.

But am likely completely wrong.

1. All of his female characters are practically the same. It gets old when all of them are feisty, sassy, pretty girls who in love with the Doctor. 

2. This problem has resolved itself now, but Amy, Rory, and River have all had far too many episodes. I never got attached to Amy and Rory because they wouldn't let them go. Toward the end their episodes just seemed forced and it was deeply disappointing because Karen and Arthur are good actors. I was more relieved to see them leave when I should have been sad. And then there's River, who just popped up whenever they felt like writing her in. Also not a sad departure, if that even was a real departure.

3. It seems as though he's catering more to the American audience than previous show-runners. The episodes from series 5-7a seem like they're trying to be cool action shows rather than sci-fi. 

4. The sonic screwdriver basically turned into a Star Trek tricorder. It still doesn't do wood, but it can tell you what nearly every substance in the galaxy is?

5. Monster-of-the-week episodes. Moffat was very good, in my opinion, at writing filler-episodes under RTD. Those were some of my favourite episodes, in fact. But when you air the same type of episode week after week it starts becoming less interesting.

Despite all of this, I think that series 7b has gotten much better and I hope it continues to improve.

true,AhhBisto,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I'm gutted he's going but it was inevitable really. A small curse the show has is that it's too popular at times and because of the filming schedule, the opportunity to do other acting roles is often very limited for the people involved. It's part of what David Tennant dealt with too and no doubt something Matt Smith has been dealing with (starring in Ryan Gosling's directorial debut should say it all). Good luck to him though, he's a talented guy and i'm sure he will have a long and successful career.

As for the future of the show now, it's hard to predict what will happen next but i think we all know that John Hurt is not the 12th Doctor. There are numerous ideas about his role in the show's 50th anniversary but the evidence points to him being either the 8th Doctor later in his cycle, a regeneration ""stripped"" of the name Doctor (so technically the real 9th Doctor) or somewhat of a mix between 8 and 9.

I would love to see the BBC try something new with the series and bring in someone like Idris Elba. He's already a massive star in his own right, extremely talented and would make history as the first black actor to play the role. I should point out that my wish for him to be The Doctor has nothing to do with the recent ""DW is racist"" crap that's been in the press, but something that could really elevate the show into new heights.

Whatever and whoever the future of the show is, i can't wait to see what happens.

However, I think it's more likely that the top one is [Freund](http://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/m/mIh3_QqTcH76yGS86LXmjmA/140.jpg). It's got that curly S and the crossed T, and you can actually see the ""eund"" of his last name

As for the bottom one... it's a long shot but maybe Caulker. http://i.ebayimg.com/t/HAND-SIGNED-12x8-PHOTO-STEVEN-CAULKER-TOTTENHAM-HOTSPUR-SPURS-COA-/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/teYAAMXQ8OdRLnib/$(KGrHqNHJEIFElKu3)6TBRLni,tceg~~60_35.JPG

Actually, I'm thinking the bottom one might be Holtby. http://i.ebayimg.com/t/TOTTENHAM-HOTSPUR-FC-SPURS-LEWIS-HOLTBY-FOOTBALL-ORIGINAL-SIGNED-PHOTO-/00/s/MTA3OFgxNjAw/z/~CsAAOxy9eVRR4qq/$T2eC16NHJHYE9nzpc)CeBRR4qqW!ow~~60_35.JPG and [Holtby 2](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Tottenham-Hotspur-Signed-Photos-lewis-holtby-new-signing-12x8-Size-/00/s/OTc5WDEyMTg=/z/Il4AAOxyEHxRIP6i/$T2eC16VHJGQE9noM,KSRBRIP6i,sRQ~~60_35.JPG)

I mean, none of them are spot on but I think when they sign these things fast, the letters don't always overlap the exact same way.

true,LeTouche,num30-away,,"Wowowow! Passing sideways is all Luka Modric did and he's lauded as one of the best midfielders in the world! 

Scotty is that annoying little bulldog who runs and runs, blocking and tackling all the time in defence, whilst in attack he has the experience and know how to slow down the play when we're erratic, to hold onto the ball to allow others to make space, and to play us out of trouble, rather than clear it wildly. He passes out wide to get other players into the game, and he pushes the team forward when he can.

Obviously I'm singing his praises a little here. I agree, when we had Sandro fit, Moussa had fewer defensive requirements. But as the season went on, Moussa matured and learned his role a little more. He began to pick his moments more wisely, which made us a better team too. No, Moussa wasn't as much a star performer in the 2nd half as in the 1st, but that's because G-Baz was stealing headlines.

Whilst I agree, Scott didn't quite get used to the formation, especially when we were switching to 4-3-3 often later on, he was also silently good for us. And again, whilst I agree he's been a shadow of his former self this season, he's still been a good performer. But again, he did have some shockers! haha.

Hudd on the other hand is a totally different player. A little like Sandro with his physicality and general large-ness (but worse at defending), and a bit like Pirlo, pinging passes here and there (but worse, of course). I truly believe that if refined a little, he can be a truly special player. His passing is simply top notch.

I've been speaking in terms of keeping him vs sellinghim at this point anyway, which I think is important to note.

It's worked better than under Kenny because Rodgers gives his players very specific instructions on how to play, whereas Kenny's management style was more ""play your natural game"". For someone like Henderson, who was new to the club, not confident, pressured by his transfer fee, and about as tactically intelligent as most other British footballers (i.e. not very), that meant disappearing during games, except for occasional moments of quality.

And playing wide isn't always about the skill or pace to beat defenders - Downing doesn't beat defenders either, but has been a solid and consistent performer for us for the second half of the season. Why Henderson does work out wide is that he can cover lots of ground, he's a decent crosser should the opportunity arise, he can tuck inside and become an extra CM, and he's a good passer with the ability to create.

Tennant had a really good balance between intense and light hearted and Matt Smith has been pretty much entirely light hearted. I prefer it to Eccleston certainly and have quite liked humour. The Rory/Amy/Doctor trio was the best companion scenario of the show since 2005 (can't comment on before that) and by a long long way. There have been some great episodes along the way and those who are saying it's childish - the Angel's in Manhattan episode was not childish nor was the episode when Amy gets stuck somewhere and has to live there for 30 or 40 years or something only to refuse to be rescued when Rory and the Doctor return. That was pretty intense and there have also been some scary moments one of which stands out to me. I found it pretty scary when Amy and Rory get stuck inside the Tardis and they get separated by sliding metal doors and keep meeting each other again having experienced different amounts of time. Eventually Rory is left for 2000 years in a couple of seconds (for Amy). The thought of someone being trapped for 2000 years with no warning. The idea that after the door shuts you have no idea how long the person will have been trapped for and you have no idea what they will look like when you turn around, if they'll be dead or alive is quite scary and that's only a concept that they explore in detail in Matt Smith's time AFAIK excluding time passing after a journey in the Tardis obviously. Also the did it over an over again: Rory waited 2000 years at the Pandorica, Amy in the Tardis, Amy in 'The Girl who Waited' and the above scene in 'The Doctor's Wife'. Some good episodes IMO and a likeable Doctor who's not overly intense. Not sure about the new companion but I'm sure I'll get used to her.

EEeeeehh....

I mean, the problem with the departure of the Ponds was that they didn't die - if you take my meaning.  Rose went literally into a parallel universe and isn't part of the fabric of reality anymore.  Donna - well, you can't talk to her, or she might remember, and make her brain explode.  

The Ponds?  They're in New York.  And it's dumb - ""I can't go back to 1938!""  What?  Why?  He solves harder problems than this literally every week!  Plus, couldn't he... I dunno... go back and pick them up in 1939?  I know they'd be cross after waiting a year, but they're still alive!  They lived to old age!  Or, what about going to New Jersey and catching a ferry to New York.  I mean, I know it's New Jersey and all, but come on!  Or, if he can't go to New York, go to Kansas City, and mail them a postcard, asking them to catch a train!  Hell, go to London and send them a telegram; tell them to take a Zeppelin!

So, in my opinion, The Angels Take Manhattan was silly and a completely ineffectual way to say good bye to the Ponds - they're alive; it's an easily solvable problem; and yet, he's supposed to be so inconsolable and broken up about it that it's ""completed"" his character arc transformation?  If he had cause to actually be that broken up about it, he should (/could) have fixed it, which cheapens the sorrow and remorse he feels!

true,thezapzupnz,null,null,"Can do.

1. His writing style often includes quite one-dimensional characters which don’t evolve over a smooth progression but as the plot demands.

2. He doesn’t seed plot elements across the series, but rather throws them at the viewer — akin to explaining a story, not showing the events happening. Sometimes the resolution to something comes out of nowhere.

3. Moffat relies on the same tropes for episode or series resolution — namely, « everything you just saw didn’t happen » (which is something I’m hugely critical of in the series 3 finale)

4. His characters are hard sometimes hard to relate to. They don’t have clear motivations; sometimes those need to be spelled out to the viewers.

5. Moffat is not the best at writing females. They tend to be one-liner machines with mammary glands. River is an example. (By the when, at what point did the Doctor actually fall in love with her? They always just seemed to vaguely flirt like two one-liner machines stuck in a continual loop — the wedding they had seemed more symbolic than anything)

6. Moffat makes clichés of many elements of Doctor Who. In series 7 part 1, it seemed as though the Doctor couldn’t wait to tell people that he has more than one heart. (To be fair, I find it somewhat easier to forgive the continuous references to past Doctors in series 7 part 2 because the Fiftieth is coming up, but it’s still a point of criticism to me)

6b. If I might continue this point, turning the name of the series into the ultimate question that should never be asked is either a stroke of genius or an exercise in kitsch. Characters asking the question once every series is pretty cute. Once every three episodes is taking the mick. (I’m in the latter camp)

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

That’s the criticism side. Here’s Moffat’s strengths, and why some may feel they don’t match Doctor Who.

1. One aristotelian element of drama that Moffat excels at is Spectacle. He can put on a good show. That actually matches Doctor Who well, but is extremely lacking without …

2. The aristotelian element which is Character. Moffat is great with one-dimensional characters which don’t need to evolve. That works great for Sherlock where the characters are somewhat set in stone. It doesn’t work for Doctor Who. Clara strikes me as a bit like a classic-era companion — very hard to relate to, as she is (for the time being) just a puzzle for the Doctor to figure (which he has).

-=-=-=-=-==-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I should disclaim, those are my points. You may disagree with them, and others may do as well, but I tried to answer your request as best as I could.

By the way, I think you’ll find that most people who aren’t fans of Moffat’s style for series 5 onwards don’t have the same criticisms of his two episodes per series from Series 1 to Series 5.

(Tangentially, I don’t think Series 1 was as much a failure as you make out. They had terrific writers, especially in stories like Robert Holmes, and even the most ridiculous episodes (particularly the ones with the Slitheen) explored themes that really examined who the Doctor is without having to spell it out like more recent series have. Also, in deference to the previous paragraph, I find Moffat’s two-parter from series 1 perhaps the best story in the series — and one of the best for the whole series of Doctor Who.",0,1370141257,null,0,false,0,caafkky,t3_1fhy28,t1_caafkky,t3_1fhy28,null,1430956317,25,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,25

In Nu-Who, Eccleston was forthright and stern with little wonder but lots of gravitas. Tennant brought back the wonder, and would be sad and serious, but very rarely could he do it at the same time. But Smith hit it right on the head for me. He was over-protective while being haphazard. He was vengeful while being loving. He was full of inquisitive while being all knowing.

He was the perfect mix of what a person is and what a person should strive to me.

Maybe we're talking past each other. Yes, Matt Smith sometimes summons a bit of goofy body language and runs a bit, but his character is written rather dark. We're always being shown or told that he's dangerous and powerful and just one step from being a villain.

&gt;I'm not sure how I'd feel about a Doctor who wasn't cocksure and arrogant. To me he's like a super geeky, less sexual Tony Stark, he's a badass and he knows it.

How much Who have you seen? The Second Doctor was very successful pretending to be far weaker and more ignorant than he really was. I don't know how much he was faking the fear. And the Fifth... some people go so far as to think this exchange is all you need to know:

If we even make the argument that it was posted from a  GMT+1 country at 23:11 (11:11) or from somewhere where it is 11:11AM, the joke was still unintentional since the timestamp says 22:11 from anywhere it is viewed as BBC's website displays the timestamp in GMT!

I think it is quite obvious that the commenter who said they posted at 11:11 converted the 24 hour time incorrectly in excitement at the prospect of an in-joke. Yes it was 11:11 somewhere in the world when it was posted but that's pushing it to say they where making an 11th Doctor joke for fans in Hawaii or France.

Ok, I specifically remember watching The Five Doctors when I was a teenager, and heard the Time Lord council offer The Master a pardon and a full new 12 regenerations, if he saves The Doctor.  So, clearly, there is some way in the Doctor Who cannon for a time lord to get past the limit.  With Galifrey time locked, perhaps The Doctor now has access to whatever technology allows this.

Then we have the Valeyard who is an ""amalgamation of the Doctor from between his twelfth and final incarnations.""  Note that it says incarnations.  Plural.

And didn't River Song give The Doctor her remaining regerations?

There's plenty of things in the show, new and old to allow us to get past regeneration 12.

One of the characters, known as The Professor, meets a version of himself in one of these universes. His friends have a hard time differentiating between Professor Prime and New Professor.

It's clear Moffat does not give a shit about any of the things that happened in the show prior to him taking the reigns because all those characters and all the connective tissue that made Doctor Who so perfect and unique was thrown to the wayside to make way for godawful characters like River Song. To me it seems like Moffat is convinced he is the do all, end all word of God when it comes to DW and its his baby to treat as terribly as he sees fit.

Although I really disagree with most of those points (although you probably knew that going in), I appreciate that you took the time to write up your thoughts. I know what you mean with characters like Clara. In my opinion she has been good/great in Moffat episodes, especially Snowmen, but has fallen short in most others. Perhaps this means that Moffat has failed in his cooperation with other writers in order to maintain good character development for her throughout the series, and not just in his episodes. I agree with you when it comes to ""Doctor Who?"" as a major part of the show. It never really worked for me. 

""He doesn’t seed plot elements across the series, but rather throws them at the viewer — akin to explaining a story, not showing the events happening. Sometimes the resolution to something comes out of nowhere."" I can see where you're coming from, but at least we're not still using the ""randomly throw Bad Wolf at the end of an episode until something happens"" times. Moffat plans ahead, that's the biggest thing that separates him from RTD in my opinion.

As far as season 1 goes, I was not saying I didn't like it. Rather, I found it quite enjoyable. I just thought that it went from a B- in season 1 to a  B+ for 2-4.

Pjanic at CM seems at lot more likely if Baldini ends up lillywhite.


My biggest issue with your lineup is Rose&gt;BAE. Obviously Rose was massive for Sunderland this year, but I feel like he still needs to earn starter status playing at WHL regularly. He is a massive talent, and I really don't think that having the best LB backup in the league would be a bad thing if Bennie ends up starting. Basically what I am saying is that BAE due to his return from injury this season and his previous form deserves starting LB role until Rose usurps him.

Im'ma, Im'ma take this lineup in the bathroom with me now, to uh...brush my teeth?

true,Mild111,silence,Silence,"For me, (One of those ""Johnny come latelys"") The issue is not that things are changing.  It's that it HAS become such a production.  

When you only get 7-9 episodes a year, and 11th's span was Story #202 - #241...that's only 39 stories.  For any other TV show's main actor to only be in 39 ""Stories"" would be under 2 years worth of work.  This show does get very emotional, and though this is my ""First Doctor,"" since becoming a fan I have watched several older episodes, and get emotional over those as well.  

I was re-watching the ""Revisited: Fourth Doctor"" special just today, and I long for a time when we can still find creative ways to make one actor be relative and interesting for 7 years.

Series 7b went by so quick that I'm still emotionally saying goodbye to Amy and Rory, and we just said goodbye to River, and now the Doctor.  I can handle cast changes, but I would almost rather have it all happen at once, or please make it more distant.  At this rate, we will be saying goodbye to Clara at the end of the next 1/2 season.

true,riquiscott,tardis,TARDIS,"It's really not hard, just time intensive &amp; requires patience. First, the shoes: cheap hooker shoes. No, seriously, don't spend a lot. The finish needs to be as smooth as possible, no texture, no embellishment. These were regularly 14.99, knocked down to 8.99 cheap plastic ""faux patent"" tramp shoes I picked up a Charlotte Russe. 


Next, pick your design. You can do paper based (I've used comic book images for Wonder Woman shoes. The Pi shoes were wrapping paper from Think Geek) or fabric based. Honestly, the fabric ones are way better/easier. Spoonflower.com has any fabric you could ever want. The TARDIS and Firefly shoes are fabric wraps. 


Next, Mod Podge, scissors, SHARP Exacto knife, a sponge brush, towel and paper towels. Figure out the lay of the pattern on the fabric and how you want it on the shoe. The FF &amp; T shoes I left the heel exposed because the color matched. If you can't match then you'll need to wrap the heel first. 


Cut out a wedge 2 inches longer and 1 inch wider than the heel. Coat the heel liberally with Mod Podge (from hence forth MP cause I'm getting lazy) Repeat for second heel, set aside and let dry (about 30-45 min depending on temp/humidity) 


Cut out an oval in your fabric large enough to cover the whole shoe, leaving about 1/2 inch hanging past the sole. Cut the oval almost entirely in half long ways, starting at the heel and ending at about 1/2-1 inch from the front top of the shoe. 

Coat the top front (nose) liberally in MP and start laying your fabric, eeking out wrinkles, bubbles, etc as you go. work around one side of the shoe. At the heel, cut your fabric so it goes past the middle of the back by about 1/4 inch. coat the other side with MP, lay down fabric. 


When you get to the heel, cut fabric to 1/2 inch, fold in half and lay over the overlap. Trim the top fabric 1/2 inch around the top. 


Cut triangles towards the shoe ending about 1/8 from the shoes every 1/2 inch all the way around. Coat the inside top of the shoe with MP and start working the triangles down. You'll need 2 or 3 coats to get it to lay down solid. 

Wait for the shoes to completely dry (over night) then take the Exacto knife and trim the bottom over hang right where the sole meets the actual shoe. 


Over the next 2 days put on coats of MP, allowing to dry completely between coats so it doesn't get milky. On cloth, I use 5-6 coats. On paper you need 15 coats MINIMUM. Once all coats are on, wait 2 full days then wet sand them smooth. 


First use 200-300 grit WET sandpaper and you are going to want to wet sand these babies. You know you are done with the 200-300 when there are no shiny or high spots left. Let dry. 


Wet sand again with 400-600. This will give you a nice satin finish. You can stop here or you can go 800-1000 wet sand for a higher gloss. 


All told, about 5 hours. If you want an DIY on the paper coated shoes, let me know and I'll type it later. But I've discovered the cloth ones are superior. The paper tends not to flex well with the shoe &amp; you get cracks that let moisture in which causes the paper to peel off the shoe in places. Lots of wear and the paper coated shoes just die (an ugly death considering the amount of work that went in to them)",0,1370148852,null,0,false,0,caaholm,t3_1fhi78,t1_caaholm,t1_caahdu3,null,1430955317,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12

Christopher Eccleston took over after a very long hiatus from regular television. A name that someone would recognize was needed. The show needed to get back on its feet.

Today the show already has a huge and active fan base. It doesn't need a big name doctor to come in bringing fans just because of them. To me that would be a bit of a gimmick.

I've written about this before soooo....

I would be for a female Doctor (I've seen it done before, it's cool). Since Doctor Who is a show that rewrites itself you can do whatever. I'd point out the Corsair thing and River changing race.

For arguments against...

The Doctor has been **white male for 11 incarnations** and some people would feel it odd if he changed. It would be odd but I don't think that's a reason against it. Doctor Who has survived by the long cherished method of ""making stuff up as we go along"". It has no problem bringing in new/weird things or outright contradictions. For example, we had no idea he could regenerate for the first three years of the tv show. How radical would it be to change out the main cast member around whom all the mystery was centered? Yet they changed Hartnell into Troughton. Are we now saying that gender is such a big obstacle that it trumps changing main cast characters?

If we did get a female companion, in the long run years from now, fans of the future would understand exactly why the Doctor was white male for 11 incarnations and then suddenly female: It's the time period. The early 21st century/mid 20th century. The idea of transgenderism (as the Doctor's regeneration could be seen as) is pretty controversial and not widely accepted in today's society.

**Some people feel that gender is a very important part of the character** and believe that gender is one of the fixed aspects of society/their world and that it should not be tampered with (which is also partly why transgenderism is controversial). Personally I feel that gender is useless unless used in a binary (two options: male or female) way. If gender stopped being binary there would be no point in using it as a way to define people and the pressure of comments like ""because you're X gender you should like pink/blue"" would not be a thing. Gender needs to stop restricting people.

Also I feel that the Doctor is not particularly masculine or feminine in a traditional sense. He's not athletic, impulsively aggressive, domineering. He's emotional, sensitive and intelligent. Things that all people can be (and should be imo; even if society goes around telling men they aren't allowed to cry). Including core traits like  intelligence and sensitivity is the Doctor's eccentricity and optimism. These traits are (imo) essential to the character of the Doctor but they are not male-exclusive traits.

**People don't want the character to be a gimmick**, which is a fair concern. Doing a gender swap is a big move and a real minefield. We don't want the Doctor to be making a joke out of being female but also don't want it to be ignored. This one is all up to whether or not you trust the writers to do a good job. I don't know if I do.

Plus, **would anyone buy it**? I have a feeling that the casual audience would flip the heck out. People might cite this time period as the time when Doctor Who finally jumps the shark. There would be backlash. There would be people just *waiting* to see sexism where there is none (or maybe the writers suck at their jobs). It's a minefield.

**The Doctor's relationships** is another concern. What would happen between he and River? How would the companion dynamic change? Well it'd sure be something interesting to explore, that's all I can say. River Song is bisexual so a female Doctor wouldn't be an issue for her. Though you *can* have a romantic relationship without having a sexual one (it's called asexual romanticism as opposed to aromantic asexuality).

**Historical concern** is an issue. The Doctor would be at a disadvantage if she ever visited time periods on Earth (even today in some places) where women are treated poorly (um like all the time periods lol). It's like the crap Martha took as the Doctor took her to past time periods. It would be interesting. It might or might not be addressed. For one thing, sexism towards women in the past wouldn't be an issue if all the Earth stories we wrote about weren't set in European or post-European-contact societies or other societies that treat women as lessers. Also, how big of an issue has being female been for the Doctor's companions who go to past time periods? Not too much. The show glosses that stuff over or it gets a random comment somewhere. If the Doctor was non-white, he (or she) might end up avoiding time periods hostile to them. The current Doctor does this. Has the Doctor ever visited feudal Japan or ancient China?

**In spite of all of this** I would still be interested and would still give it a shot. Plus, there is a spin-off media character called **Iris Wildthyme** who travels through space and time in a red double decker bus that's smaller on the inside armed only with her intelligence and handy sonic corkscrew. She's a batty crazy older woman who likes to drink and has adventures. She's met the Doctor in alt. media and often her stories are parodies of his. In a meta sort of way, Iris seems to think she's had the same experiences as the Doctor (as if she is him) but she also knows her life is a parody of his. She comes from the Clockworks people (code for Time Lords) and is possibly from the Obverse (whatever that is). She's pretty much a female Doctor and great. All her stories are intentionally campy funny and fun but still maintain good writing. Iris is an awesome character and I encourage people to try out a story of hers to get an idea of a female Doctor. Plus she's played by **Katy Manning**, the actress who played Jo Grant, 3rd Doctor companion.

So there are a lot of concerns for a gender (or race) change and I've addressed the main ones here. In the end, some things would change and some things would be addressed. Change is good, addressing is good. Going new places is good. Not screwing up the show with bad writing is also good.",0,1370155499,null,0,false,0,caaj5gb,t3_1fi9vs,t1_caaj5gb,t3_1fi9vs,null,1430954625,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

Throughout the series he constantly refers to himself as male, as a grandfather and such. Also throughout the series there have only been hints of him ever being attracted to female characters. Now, I'm aware that there is also a very miniscule theoretical chance that the original character was conceived as a lesbian woman inside of an old man's body, but...eh...I really don't think this was the case (not that there would be anything wrong with that). Finally, in the Narnia-like Christmas special he outright *couldn't* wear the crown because he 'wasn't strong', meaning he wasn't female (or a mother, for that matter). The tree-people who are all about 'souls rather than bodies' had scanned him inside and out and identified him as male, so I think we can pretty much trust their judgement.

The Doctor's first method of dispute resolution should never be violence -- that's, I'd say, essential.  There must always be an interest in science, in discovery and in the joy of exploration.  These and other facets of the core character have previously been realised in a male body, but I could certainly see a Grace Hopper-esque (all navy outside, but a pirate dying to be released inside!) character absolutely nailing the role in a very Sixth/Seventh Doctor fashion.

Not at all, I get your meaning. I admit I haven't finished watching the classic series (I watched only the first Doctor, half Pertwee and a little bit of Baker), but it seems to me we do agree that if the Doctor were to change gender (either cosmetically or fundamentally) it would have to be a decision, even if only on a subconscious basis? This is my main point: a female Doctor can't just come out of the blue because it would be a politically correct thing to do, there has to be a reason rooted in the Doctor's character development, otherwise the change will be groundless and shallow.

And yes, your race does affect the way you view the world and how you identify. Why? Because your race affects how the world treats you.

The Doctor never really explains why he regenerates older/younger. There's no build up character development to why the Doctor regenerates the way he does. He's said (in his 7th incarnation) that regeneration is a lottery. 5 said ""You never quite know what you're going to get.""

Both formations would take a lot tweaking and added personnel. The only other way to fit both of them into the same lineup would be to play Sturridge on the RW.

true,ljuki,sontaran,Sontaran,"One thing: River is NOT the Doctor. It's even sort of questionable to call her a real Timelady, seeing how she was born to human parents and the only reason she's Time-lordish is because she was conceived in the TARDIS. I think it's pretty safe to assume that her regenerations work at least somewhat differently than the Doctor's who is actually full-on Gallifreyan. Even if they didn't - how do we know there wasn't a reason she regenerated the way she had? We have no knowledge of the events leading up to it or who and what influenced her up until that point? While we're on the topic - imagine if she'd randomly regenerated into a boy back then. I guarantee you the fans would cry uncle if that happened and contrive various ways why that would be impossible.

Another thing: race/age do not factor in as much in the Doctor's personality and identity as they would've for River, growing up on Earth. I mean, who's going to treat him differently if he were black? The Sontarans? On the other hand, while doctor is age/colour-blind, being a near-immortal Timelord used to dealing with races and species radically different from his own, he is quite aware of gender, or so he has been so far. 

Yet another point: yes, 11 thought he was a girl for a second, but I feel people are taking this far more seriously than it was intended. What if it was just a joke? What if he'd felt his long hair and exclaimed - ""I'm a Yeti!!!"" would everyone take that as definitive proof that Timelords can regenerate into a Yeti? 

The reason I believe there is an element of choice in regenerating is because the Doctor's regenerations have all in one way or another reflected certain aspects of his personality which he ALREADY HAD. Nine was battle-worn, Ten was energetic and inquisitive, Eleven was enthusiastic, childish and protective - all of these are qualities we've come to know in the Doctor up until this point. He can't just become something he hasn't originally been, among other things - in my opinion - female.

Why the particular character traits of any generations were brought to light is something we can't know for sure. Maybe the Doctor HAD to become somewhat callous and offensive to cope with what he'd done when he regenerated into Nine. Maybe the Doctor felt a spurt of enthusiasm for life and so he regenerated into the energetic Ten. Maybe the Doctor wanted to regain innocence he thought long lost so he regenerated into the whimsical 11 - we don't know, but isn't it far more likely - and comforting - to think there ARE underlying reasons like these, rather that it's all random and for all we know the Doctor's next regeneration could be some kind of homicidal maniac because 'you never know what you're going to get'.",0,1370159380,null,0,false,0,caajted,t3_1fi9vs,t1_caajted,t1_caajkg5,null,1430954319,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

What? When did I say women can't be all these things? I was trying to make a point that femininity/masculinity is a character trait as well, one which goes beyond physical attributes and for the Doctor to express it through a regeneration, he had to have either had it already or developed it for one reason or another because - again - the Doctor was originally male. And also, who mentioned anything about gender being a different species? I distinctly said that the Doctor was blind to colour/age/species but NOT to gender, clearly differentiating between them.

And good grief, who said women can't have complex emotions, feelings or being three-dimensional, where are you getting this stuff? 

EDIT: I accidentally clicked 'submit', sorry. Let me make my point very, VERY clear.

1.  The Doctor's character has been male so far. Yes. 
2. Do I think he can suddenly become female? On the outside, possibly, he could regenerate into a female body. On the inside, no, he would still be male because a regeneration can only bring to light aspects of his personality, not turn him into something he isn't.
3. Do I think it would be WRONG for the Doctor to be female or if his being female would make him inferior. No. I just think in light of his character and the events up to this point it would be unlikely.
4. Is being female an aspect of personality? In my opinion: YES. I would be a different person if I were male, I know that for a fact. I would behave differently, make different choices, lead a different lifestyle. Not inferior, not superior, but different. NOT IN EVERYTHING, but in many things, yes. The Doctor might not share our cultural reasons on why this would be the case, but I believe he would as well. 
5. Do I think women can't be battle worn, energetic, inquisitive, enthusiastic, childish and protective or that they aren't complex three-dimensional beings. No and smack me if I know why on earth I even have to make this clear at all.

true,ms_pennyapple,null,null,"It's not that nuts, but I think he's too well known and heavily involved in writing (not just Who) to play the actual Doctor. I was thinking about Gatiss, but as I think he's being coached to be the next showrunner, I just see him continuing to write himself into one off characters - he's writing a lot and nearly always appears in a small part, but never a large one, so I think the likelihood is slim to none. 

Plus he'd look a bit egotistical, basically taking over being a good main writer *and* the main role, I can just see him at read throughs explaining to the other actors he didn't write them that way, but of course he's perfect because he wrote his character's lines and can deliver them perfectly... I don't think it'd work too well, with that sort of thing the show would die again.

 But I get the thinking, after all he co-writes for Sherlock and wrote himself as Mycroft and we know he's a gifted actor as well as writer - He just tends to appear either writing or acting in shows I enjoy, it's what I mean by a certain group of talent they seem to draw from.

I think until Moffat leaves they'll stick with the usual young (25-35) good looking, unknown but very gifted actor from the BBC drama pool. I do think Gatiss as show runner could be excellent, because of his obsession with hammer horror and how well it fits Who stories. But I also think he might not be scared to cast slightly older doctors, so left in charge he could bring a real change.

true,ljuki,sontaran,Sontaran,"&gt; Yes, men and women can be physically feminine and effeminate. But psychologically? No. Your personality may be Influenced by your biological sex but there you don't have to have X traits to identify as a certain gender or to ""become"" a different gender.

Ah...here's the thing - I fundamentally disagree, but I also don't want to have this discussion in a Doctor Who sub because anything I'd write to elaborate would have no relation to the series.

Therefore I'll just say that we can't form our opinions on what the Doctor should be based on how the human race handles the whole matter of gender. I personally believe that with entities such as the Timelords who aren't focused that much on the body, gender is an intellectual matter. Intellectually and conceptually so far, the Doctor has been male - he's referred to himself as male, he's made 'male' choices in actions and - ultimately - companions. And for something which is an intellectual matter to change, there needs to be an intellectual reason. Obviously we disagree on whether regenerating involves a choice or not - I think it does, a subconscious one or otherwise - so my opinion obviously may fall on deaf ears. If it does (involve a choice), my question is: why would he choose to be female all of a sudden? Why would he give it any thought at all, to be honest? There would HAVE to be some sort of explanation in that case. On the other hand, if it doesn't, then my question is: how come so far he's regenerated into male bodies? If we have a 50:50 chance to win the male/female lottery, for something to happen ten times in a row, it's got to be more than a coincidence. 

Personally, I find it unlikely and I believe that he's so far - subconsciously or otherwise - chosen to regenerate as male, rather than female. Again - NOT BECAUSE ONE IS SUPERIOR/INFERIOR to the other, but simply because it's how he sees himself.

I personally get over attached to everything I like. I want my shows and heroes in those shows to go on absolutely forever. I'm one of those people that thinks Swan Song (Supernatural) was an amazing ending, but having the show go on and on and on is AWESOME, even if they will never be able to end it on that same note....

I like all of the new age doctors. I didn't like when any (only two so far, but still, I will be able to add another shortly.) of them left, but the newest doctor has always been just as awesome to me as the last. I can't wait to see what happens next, it's going to be awesome EVEN IF they mess it up. Just seeing something new will be quite awesome.

I think the main issue though is that even I can get caught up in the flow of events, if only because I'm always thinking about those thing anyways. I have plenty to say about the doctors, in every aspect, good, bad, ugly, worthless, pointless, too much, too little.... and the topics on this subreddit and forums like it are going to go in a certain direction, and I will want to comment. I don't exactly feel like it diminishes anything, it's good, but I do wish it wasn't all lumped together.

I want to be able to talk about an episode that I don't like, or a concept, or a companion, without being told that I'm over exaggerating it all because of the change in doctors...

I guess I'm just saying that, just because this flow of events is going to take place, doesn't mean that we should proclaim that anyone ""playing along."" for lack of a better term, with the flow, doesn't have a well though out, not random, not because of emotional ties that are currently being broken, opinion on the topic.

We knew Matt Smith had to go to Trenzalore.  That's been one of the driving factors behind the multi-series arc throughout Moffat's reign.  And we're left with trying to squeeze a pretty significant story arc into 6 episodes that just can't support it.

Really, if we'd had a full series for this, rather than the half, it might have been significantly better.  And with this degree of hurry, the ""less than perfect"" episodes, acceptable as they might be in a bigger series, are actively stealing time from potentially good episodes.

why punish all benefits receivers just to go after the minority that misuse their money on drugs, gambling, drink or whatever.

 it won't stop people who are determined to do these things from doing them, they're just going to get the money they need for whatever habit from another source and when you're an alcho/gamble/drugaholic this can often be easier through illegitimate means.

what about people who use most of their payment sensibly and manage to have some left to enjoy? should they not be able to enjoy their money, knowing that if they overspend they'll go with a slightly emptier stomach the next week.

Fascism views political violence, war, and imperialism as a means to achieve national rejuvenation[3][6][7][8] and asserts that nations and races deemed superior should attain living space by displacing ones deemed weak or inferior.[9]

Playing Devils advocate with a few of the points:

* **Food:** How much? I can survive with a degree of comfort, on £50 per month for a food budget. Should everyone, therefore, be made to live on that amount? A colleague of mine made the mistake last year of mentioning this to an MP who shall remain nameless - he was rather interested in the news, it has to be said.

* **Water:** Most properties should be on water meters by I think 2020, but again, how much should be allowed? Two people need a greater allowance than one, but how about families? Do a four person family consisting two parents, two different sex children need more than a family with two same sex kids? etc. etc.

* **Electricity &amp; Gas:** I actually think energy companies should be legally mandated to provide special taffits to customers who are economically vulnerable - which'd constitute almost all single people in receipt of means tested welfare payments. Should they have to go with one specific supplier? How about payment method - should they be made to use ""keys"" or pre-payment cards?

* **TV Licence:** Why? If we're providing the means to have an internet connection, why the need for a tv licence? I get ~50Mb down / 5Mb up where I live - surely that's the same everywhere ;)

I rode a dirt bike for near eight years and the only broken bone I've had was from falling off a slide when I was four

&gt;I don't suppose you regularly wake up with bruises with no idea how you got them because you walk into things so regularly? Or, say, go out for a civilised dinner, fall flat on your face walking up the stairs and then scrape a great big bloody hole into your finger just by pulling your chair in under the table?

&gt;If you're going for one to look at why not go for something better looking?

I beg your pardon?! Find me a bike that's prettier than an R1!

&gt; Attempting to exert the force of the state upon private individuals is compatible with claiming to be libertarianism.

But the BBC isn't a private individual. Furthermore, because ITV and BSkyB have to conform to election airtime rules they, together with the BBC, are **ALREADY** subject to legislation in this regard. All Farage is trying to do is secure his **fair** share of airtime as he is completely entitled to do in the legislation. I would also make the case that one private individual taking another private individual to court is hardly exerting state control... either Farage has been legally wronged and has a fair case to make, or he doesn't.

There are plenty of examples of UKIPs obvious double standards but this really isn't one of them. What do you propose Farage does? Keeps his mouth shut, gets excluded from the debates and is consigned to being marginalised? As appealing as that may be for many reasons, it isn't in Farages best interests to do that. I have no issue with Farage taking legal action to secure what he is entitled to.

When UKIP claim to be libertarian, they aren't purporting themselves to be vociferously unwavering libertarians - *""down with borders and passports, bring on Austrian economics!""* Really they mean they believe in Thatcherite libertarianism (i.e. small state, large private sector, privatisation and minimal taxation... given their origins in the right, that is hardly suprising.)",0,1370170326,null,0,false,0,caal61e,t3_1fgi9x,t1_caal61e,t1_caaknpd,null,1430953581,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Hmm... Generally speaking, if you lose your job, you qualify for six months of *Contribution* based JSA. It isn't means tested, and the conditions attached to it are more relaxed - i.e. for a period of time you can be specific in the type of job / salary requirements, that you wish to apply for.

After six months, if you're still out of work, you can apply for *Income* based JSA, which is means tested. The Government will look at your income, savings etc. and if you meet the criteria, will continue to pay you JSA. Income based JSA triggers the eligibility for other types of ""benefits"" such as free dental work, prescriptions, glasses etc. etc.

One argument I've seen presented, is that restrictions on the payment of JSA should apply to income based recipients. Essentially everyone gets ""cash"" payments for the first six months, then it moves to a combination of cash / ""vouchers"" for [X] amount of months, gradually moving more towards ""vouchers"".

The problem, - well, one of the problems, is a sense of unfairness.

Should a 19 year old kid who has only worked for a year, be treated the same as someone who has worked for twenty years?

How about someone who has worked for thirty years?

What about the level of contribution? I was a top-tier tax payer in my early 20s - if I lose my job would I be treated differently than if I'd been working a minimum wage job for the last 14 years? Or would I get two different rules applied to me, as I'm now just a regular tax payer?

I watched every game that big nosed, beautiful croation beast played for us, and it was delightful to see.

BUT his main role was that of the 'deep lying playmaker', where he would distribute the ball to the wings, keep possession, slow down the play, make sure our attackers had the time and the space to move. He was the reason we had 60% possession a lot of the time, back then.

Sure, he got the odd assist or wonder strike. But his stats were never particularly impressive for goals and assists. He's the man who would assist the assist, giving it to lennon and bale who would whack crosses to Ade, or slotting it to VdV who'd then feed Defoe.

Right, now then! If you think this is just some crazy unprovked attack you are so very wrong. 

That savage who would attack and behead someone in London should indeed put away but not ignored; let us ask our selves this:

Why? Why would someone do something so crazy and talk to the camera about it knowing he is gonna get caught? what drove him to this?

99% of the reason is probably something like he has anger issues and just is plain mental, but that 1% of a reason is important because maybe, just maybe, if Blair and his friend Bush didn't wage a war on the Middle East for something some Saudis did in response to how well funded and supported Israel is, then maybe this attack wouldn't have happened. 

Al-Qaeda is an idea... the idea that the west is attacking the way of life in the middle east via a proxy war (Israel). Before I set foot in the west I lived in various places like Syria/Tunisia/Palestine and believe me when I say I hated everything about the west and wanted to see Britain split into small little pieces of shits that just fight each other because, as far as I was concerned, My home town was not a property of the British Government to give away with the Balfour Promise of 1917. 

I wanted the US to just burn because we were bombed and kicked out of our homes with US tax money. I then came here and all that changed... (I was 13... yes I was 13 and wanted to see entire countries burned because I was angry) 

Living here showed me how governments and people think, how no one is to blame every single time... Sometimes your best friend is a British/American citizen. In fact we could learn a lot from the west but hey hoe... I feel sorry for my fellow country men letting crazy people with beards tell them what to think. 

We need to stop killing them and befriending countries that bomb them with drones on a frequent basis... We do all this and expect no consequence? this is just naive of us.  ",0,1370171920,null,0,false,0,caalcbp,t3_1fiijy,t1_caalcbp,t3_1fiijy,null,1430953500,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The sg government has also been tightening up immigration process a lot, due to increasing unhappiness caused by too many immigrants who are not trying to integrate (sounds familiar ? Haha). The top post in the Quora link perfectly shows the general sentiment there:

I would personally like to see a move for Omar Gonzalez, currently at LA Galaxy for our CB position. Young with a lot of potential, voted into the MLS XI multiple times. 

As for a left back I would like Cresswell, there are enough reports on him already, though. 

Midfield is a bit trickier as we have to find a creative spark that can set up plays and be attacking. I like to think that N'Zogbia could play this role very well at his full potential. However, AZ Alkmaar midfielder, Markus Henriksen could also prove to be effective. 20 years old and a hot prospect in the Eredivisie.

As GK cover I'd like to see Benji Siegrist promoted from within but if not then another goalie that is young and that wouldn't mind sitting on the bench to cover Guzan. Wolf from Werder Bremen would be my choice if Siegrist still isn't ready.

In addition to those, some great signings in the striking department could be made in the form of Yassine Benzia from Lyon and John Guidetti from Manchester City.

There are countless examples that a simple Google search can provide, but here's something similar to what I do because I host my own email.

As an example for email: 

 - Set up a cheap VPS (e.g. http://www.cloudnext.co.uk/vps/), install Webmin if you're not that technical, to manage it via a web browser.
 - Buy a personal domain name from someone like Fasthosts with the privacy features enabled
 - Point the A and MX records for the domain to your VPS
 - Set the reverse PTR record (ask Cloudnext to do this) to the same as your domain name, set the hostname on the server to the same: # echo 'YOURDOMAIN.COM' &gt; /etc/hostname &amp;&amp; hostname -b -F /etc/hostname
 - Install your desired MTA. I usually go for Exim4 but Postfix is also very good. Configure it to only allow authenticated users to relay mail through the server. Install Dovecot for your POP3/IMAP server
 - Only enable the SSL versions of POP3/IMAP
 - Grab a free SSL cert from www.startssl.com and install it

For web traffic you could also proxy your connection through your new server:

 - Install Squid
 - Configure UFW to allow incoming Squid connections from only your home IP address

Want DNS too?

 - Install BIND, set it to forward all requests to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Again, only allow requests from your home network because you might have just installed an open resolver if not, and that's a Bad Thing™.

And something that really pisses me off are white people deciding to become Muslims.  I live in a country where Buddhism may be considered the religious ideology of the country and because of this I have met a few white 'Born Again Buddhists'.  These people are idiots - the same as the white Muslims - who in fact are practicing Orientalism.  Stupid white middle-class people doing stupid white middle-class people stuff.

But get rid of the extreme Muslim groups.  Would Britain support a KKK movement which is essentially Christian?  So why tolerate extreme Muslim groups?

Just got off the phone to someone in England just now and he said that the BBC showed nothing but Islamaphobia propaganda just after the murder and then appeared shocked when their were EDL protests.  Everyone bitches on Reddit about  the Daily Mail but the BBC can be real cunts when it comes to unbiased reporting.

I see it just like a real pub.

They should just see us as a bunch of semi-alcoholics whom they can laugh with/at. 

However, I wasn't best pleased to see a newbie 'attacked' on here yesterday. Not gonna mention any names, but I'm sure that regular knows who they are. There's British sarcasm and dry wit and then there's crossing a line. Please be mindful that people from other cultures and continents may not always immediately pick up on our humour and be a bit mindful of it, yeah? It can be intimidating.

Most FY1/2 doctors can assume they will probably at least get mostly 1B bandings (which would work at out about £33K for FY1 and £39K for FY2). A typical F2 example would be something like this:

* 4 months 1B Banded Upper-GI surgery (~£13K)
* 4 months 1A Banded Elderly medical (~£14K)
* 4 months Unbanded GP rotation (~£9K)
* Total: £36K

I can't really comment on consultant private work here vs the states as to be honest I probably know as much about that as you do. My point really is that you *can* make a lot of money in medicine here in the UK, and you don't necessarily need to go private to do it, and at any rate you probably won't be making decisions about private work until you are approaching your 40s... by which point the NHS and the concept of private medicine could be very different things to what they are now.

As a student, if you're in the first few years I would just do some research about the different career pathways and find out what they will involve and when you have to do them. In you're in the last 2 years of medical school you could look into trying to get a publication or do an audit... but these can be huge time sinks, and you don't *need* them. Besides that just talk to surgeons on placements and ask them what you need to do.  

Pay is largely irrelevant of speciality, especially for junior grades. The differences depend very heavily on what hours you do. All I can say is that at 18-21 years old it seemed very straightforward to just work 70 hour weeks and make a small fortune... but that very quickly disappears when you start work and you'd happily accept a small cut in your pay to have a bit more free time.",0,1370177716,null,0,false,0,caam33g,t3_1fbxzd,t1_caam33g,t1_caaa0qg,null,1430953149,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,skunkd,,Belfast,"&gt;the flag is the symbol of organised governmental oppression

The flag *was* the symbol of the Northern Irish government up until 1972. 'Organised governmental oppression' is a pretty big leap to make from that. Exactly the sort of leap you could make (and many do) in associating [Celtic symbols](http://www.flickr.com/photos/20923094@N04/3365923455/) with [Irish republican oppression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kevin_lynch_grave.jpg). What the flag actually represents right now is the IFA national teams. 

Or put it another way - does the Tricolour represent the IRA?

I believe you're guilty of cognitive bias in refusing to compare the two. [Not for the first time](http://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/1f7ujv/is_the_irish_flag_green_white_and_gold_or_green/ca7twjj).

&gt;It's still not a factoid to say that NI doesn't have an official flag. That is a fact, not a factoid.

It's a factoid in the context of NI the football team, which is what we're discussing after all.

&gt;Saying loudly that one way is the correct way to interpret it does not make it so.

I've already said I can see how it's not perfect, and what flag isn't, however I'm pointing out the obvious - a few people are attempting to stonewall what it represents *right now* in favour of harking back to something that ceased to exist over 40 years ago.

Tbh, I think a lot of the in-chat will slow down when people's Reddit gold starts to expire and they no longer get notifications of tagged posts, reading through a 50-post reply within a reply and constantly clicking the 'more' bit gets tiring/boring. Tagging has definitely increased the level of in-chat over the last week or two, for which I feel partly responsible (having handed out so much gold).

I got to see Fox Mulder on 9 seasons of X Files, I got to see Captain Picard on seven seasons of Star Trek, I watched the same Clark Kent on 10 seasons of Smallville, we take our lead actors seriously. As much as we love George Clooney he is not Batman nor should ever have been Batman.

I realize that one of the beautiful things about Who is that the story provides a mechanism for interchanging your lead characters, which allows for longevity of the series as a whole, but there could be a happy medium where you don't have to change the entire cast every few years. It is one thing to stick with a formula until it has gotten completely stale, it is another thing to push story arc conclusions at a ridiculous pace and always being forced to say goodbye to characters prematurely.

 Sadly, the ""anything can happen"" style of television writing is pretty popular right now thanks to The Walking Dead, and several television shows are killing off long run characters by the handful.

 I just personally think that death and goodbye is too easy of a plot device, that robs television viewers of the potential of creative drama.

I think getting past this involves lurkers being more willing to post, that is make top level replies which don't really need knowledge of being a regular; but also for the regulars to realise that their replies may have unintended consequences, and if they make more of an effort to reply to non-regulars than just people they feel familiar with then it gives more of an inclusive and open atmosphere.

I'm against another reddit, that just creates more segregation. A weekly lurker thread would definitely be nice, but I don't like the idea of banning regulars from them.

So for example, would you agree with:

1. A scaled back state, such as the Victorian ""nightwatchmen""situation. (a [minarchist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minarchism) position, but also a libertarian one) Much smaller, with only a very basic safety net, or a net operated by private organisations on behalf of society, and an ongoing policy of taxing the minimum amount possible to maintain infrastructure and the government and repay existing debt?

2. Armed neutrality, non-interventionist foreign policy? (this might also mean no government funding of aid, and the
virtual mothballing of the armed forces, for example.)

3. Laissez faire economics, with minimum regulation and an expectation that voluntary agreements and self regulating economic environments are best for companies and individuals to work in? (The minimum wage would be repealed as an example of this strategy.)

4. Absolutely no government concern for, or with, any aspect of a person's lifestyle, as long as they do not impinge upon other's rights, or person.
(So while the act of paedophilia would be illegal, owning paedophilic material and pictures might well be a grey area.)

I consider myself libertarian, meaning that I balance the ills of these policies with the greater happiness and prosperity I believe they bring, but even I do not actually believe that unrestricted libertarianism would necessarily be a good thing, and a natural compromise on the extremes of both the philosophy and governing practice of libertariansim would have to be sought.

The 'conversation starter' option would, naturally, help to generate conversation, whereas the 'general thread' option would perhaps enable more of the random and off-topic, banter(ish) discussion (aka bollocks) that everybody enjoys. Although I guess that kind of stuff could quite easily develop within replies to posts in the 'conversation starter' option.

Why does a person say they hate one Doctor but love another? They are all the same man, going through changes, adapting. We watch a man grow, adapt, explore. We witnessed Ninth's anger, aggravation, become withdrawn. We experienced his rejuvenation as he rediscovers his love for exploring, sharing it with others. We then see the result of this in Tenth. A more mature but still fun-loving man. We've watched him have his hearts broken, his emotions ripped from him as he loses not one, not two, but three very important companions that had a profound affect on him. We've sadly watched him struggle with himself, to try and not care anymore, to become more detached. That lead to erratic behavior. He comes to terms with himself and with that we see Eleventh emerge. A very random Doctor, quirky and energetic (not that any Doctor wasn't energetic!). 

The Doctor is the Doctor. You cannot hate one but love the other. We do have our preferences but we cannot turn our noses up at one. I did that with Matt Smith but for a different reason.

If we continue to get great and promising players like we did with Borini, Allen, Sturridge and Coutinho with each window I can see it happening. We have to consider that other teams have been doing better than us in the transfer windows - with the obvious exception of last January.

In that case, we need to give BR time. I'll be ECSTATIC if we finish top four next season. Things to consider:

Moyes in, Fergie out.
Mourinho probably back to the helm at Chelsea.
Bye-bye Mancini.
Laudrup and Clarke with impressive seasons.

United probably won't finish first. They might, but it's unlikely. Will they do well? Obviously. However with Moyes in charge WE stand a better chance of beating them, helping us finish higher.

Mourinho will fill Chelsea with confidence. It might give them a false sense of security and bite them in the ass, or it'll be one of the best seasons Mou has ever had. Hell they might win the league. This will either make it easier or harder for us to beat them. Thankfully we almost always do well against them.

City will not be a threat to the league next season and will probably struggle hardcore for top 4. Even if Bale leaves Spurs.

Arsenal remain Arsenal which naturally means they'll make top 4. They and Spurs will be out biggest threats to a top 4 finish.

Speaking as a Muslim who grew up in the UK (in fact less than 2 miles from Woolwich) during the 'war on terror' period I think I can provide some insight. Muslims have been around for decades in the UK and yet this sort of terrorism has only been prevalent in the past decade so it's a relatively new problem. Also Muslim terrorists don't tend to be immigrants, they tend to be disproportionately converts (i.e. didn't grow up in a Muslim family) and are born/raised in the UK so this isn't an immigration issue. Their primary motive is political, 7/7 was a response to the Iraq invasion and the attack on Lee Rigby was a revenge attack for his role in the war as well. 

To better understand why young Muslims are drawn to these political acts of violence you have to think of the climate in which they grew up. Before 9/11 very few people would know anything at all about Islam and few would be able to distinguish it from Hinduism or Sikhism. Most Muslims would have been living in Britain just as they are today but unnoticed. After 9/11 Islam and Muslims were thrust into the spotlight with overwhelmingly negative coverage. Muslims were forced to distance themselves from it at every turn and still expect criticism from wider society for it. Of course, the attack being carried out by a foreign, exclusively Muslim, Islamist group meant this was always going to happen but the response meant Muslims were now being scrutinised heavily and asked to explain why Muslims were doing this. 

The second element was the lack of explanation for the terrorism, there was a lot of condemnation and Afghanistan was quickly invaded as a response but very few people got to understand why Bin Laden had attacked the WTCs. It was largely censored and any effort to seek the reasoning was unthinkable and equal to justifying 9/11. I remember this is how I felt and many Muslims were left confused here they'd never dream of doing something like that. Then Iraq got invaded under dubious circumstances, you had Guantanamo Bay, the Mahmudiyah massacre, Abu Ghraib etc. and it felt there was a full blown global war on Muslims.

Imams in mosques were largely useless at picking up on these feelings experienced by young British Muslims. Most imams would have been immigrants from South Asia who knew little about the wars or 'war on terror' aside from the fact it was a bad thing. Thus their sermons would focus on making sure you be a good Muslim and listen to your parents and would fail to address the massive elephant in the room. This is why people like Anjem Choudhury gained a following because he actually addressed these issues (although spread a load of nonsense in the process). Most of the 'radicalisation', i.e. reaching a position where you end up feeling it is justified to carry out a politically motivated attack in response to the 'war on terror', would have occurred online though - not because of 'radical preachers'. These preachers would have merely drawn in young Muslims who were already radicalised. These people would have been Muslims who read up about the motives behind 9/11, seen the response of Western governments to 9/11 and consequently felt attacks were justified because of the subsequent actions of the governments, i.e. Iraq War. Note the reason you don't get Bangladeshi housewives committing terrorist attacks is because (despite most being religious Muslims and unable to speak good English) they are apolitical, whereas Michael Adebolajo and Germaine Lindsay were extremely politically aware, well integrated and spoke perfect English. 

In terms of ensuring attacks like Woolwich don't happen again this is impossible, it will be relatively easy to stop terrorist groups but preventing individuals killing others is pretty much impossible. Saying that, in my personal opinion I think there's been very little violence/terrorism since 7/7 in the UK and the response from Muslims has been pretty clear in condemnation so we're doing pretty well as it stands. There needs to be a space for open discussion regarding the 'war on terror' which Muslims who have concerns about it can talk to, ideally mosques would invite soldiers/ex-soldiers and politicians in to put forward their side. This is because soldiers are viewed negatively by some Muslims because of their perception as being disproportionately racist and anti-Muslim. Having British soldiers positively interact with Muslims in the UK would change this because otherwise there's little interaction if any at all. Also having imams who can eloquently criticise government policy, advocate non-violent political objection (e.g. to foreign policy) and actually make a difference by influencing politicians or the public. I guarantee you if that happened people like Anjem Choudhury who would lose attention very quickly and these imams would be the ones on national television with both Muslim and non-Muslim support. Currently there is [Ajmal Masroor](http://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2013/05/new-voices-european-islam) but ideally there'd be more of them and they'd be getting more attention - far more than Anjem is anyway.

They also slip straight into your ear without having to spend the time making the foam smaller to insert into your ear. 

The reason for the cable going up, is that it wraps around the back of your ear. When an artist is onstage, the cable runs down their back and into a radio belt pack. It is tidy and hidden. The IEM is also more secure and less likely to fall out if the cable is tugged.

Holes used to be dug with a spade and would take a long time, today we use caterpillar trucks and it takes less time to produce the same result (and therefore increase wealth).  

Books used to be handwritten by monks and information took a long time to produce and copy, then we got the printing press and less people were involved in the production, even though output (and therefore wealth) increased.  Today we don't even use printing presses anymore and use the internet instead, whereby copying information is near-free and much of the world's knowledge is accessible to everyone for free using Wikipedia, Google, Coursera, Khan Academy, EdX and countless other private organisations.

Metalwork used to be done by hand, today much of it is done by machines, as anything from cars to computers is created with humans toiling over it.

There are, quite literally, thousands of examples of things that used to be made by labour power and are today done by machines.  The result is that, today, even the poorest teenagers in tiny remote villages in countries like Pery and Bolivia have access to internet via mobile phones, because machines make them so cheap to produce.

What if they'd only worked twenty years? Would they have to donate twice a year?

Ten years work history = 3 donations.

Less than ten years = 4 donations.

Then what of those who can't donate, because they'd fall foul of the risk factors that the NHS have built into the donation process?

true,Napier13,null,null,"I would feel like they've missed an opportunity if his line isn't 'Geronimo'. I think it's a really fitting summary of his character and how he'd feel about the situation; the fear he feels about letting his old self go and the excitement of becoming someone new. 

'Regenerating is cool' is very tacky. It's what he says when he's trying out clothes that he knows are slightly silly in attempt to make his companions laugh and endear to his dress sense. And that's it. I feel like that line would be making a joke out of the situation, and that's not really what we want.

'I hope I'm ginger' would be a really roped in callback. He has mentioned the desire to be ginger exactly twice and I feel that bringing that joke back would just be beating a dead horse. I would maybe possibly be okay with a little aside to his hair colour after his regeneration, but do we really want this line to be repeated every time he regenerates?

Matt Smith is great at his speeches, and no doubt we'll get one during the episode that will hopefully perfectly capture his time as the Doctor nicely. Looking back, his monologue in the Rings of Akhaten would have done nicely, so that's a shame I guess. But I know that it'll be moving and beautiful and brilliantly acted, because Moffat is going to dedicate a lot of time and effort (hopefully much more than some of his previous efforts) to 11's final moments.

So 'Geronimo' is my bet. It captures the 11th Doctor's bravery, madness, fear and humour all in one nice little word. Plus, it would serve as perfect bookends, 'Geronimo' being one of his first lines on the show, reminding us that this particular ending is just the start of another beginning.

Now with Rupert, I've only seen him in Harry Potter, so I don't know if he has that 'spark' the doctor needs.  

Then I reconsidered Cumberwhatsis with red hair.  He would be unspeakably gorgeous and all sorts of light effects would be fantastic as the doctor's last, 'angelic' incarnation.  And if Clara is still around and to be a love interest, their looks would contrast beautifully. They both have such a sculpted look.
