true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;Do you think he is a reasonable target? Can we get him here, and does he want to come?

Yes, the man is not who he once was and so he could fall into our grasp. I actually am under the impression that if spurs want him, they will get him. He obviously is getting phased out at Barca and we can offer him heaps of first team footy in England on a decent salary. Transfer fee wise he is probably worth £10-12m and spurs could pay that for him.

&gt;How much do you think we should pay if we are to target him?

Granted his age and thus a lack of sell on value I wouldn't want to see spurs break £15m (and that is if desperate). £10m sounds like a good number for me, Levy could work his magic on the last day here (Barca would start to sweat if nobody had grabbed him already).

&gt;Do you think he can solve our striker problems(at least short term)?

I am not confident. Smells a bit like Torres for me, world class player playing in front of a great midfield who has a bad leg injury and doesn't quite recapture old form, now looks to greener pastures. If spurs are going to be spending &lt;£15m on a striker who may or may not come off, I would like it to be a youth option. In saying that, they guy is obviously good and would net probably around 15 goals a season. Is that enough? We could debate it all day.

The guy has been pumping out impressive enough goals over the last few years with possibly one of the greatest ever midfields behind him. At 31 years old I don't see him carrying that over to a tougher league when he only has the likes of Dembele and Holtby behind him.

&gt;how do you believe he would fit in with our current team?

Playing as a wide forward on the left or as a pure striker in a 4-3-3. He could also lead the line in a 4-2-3-1.

www.gov.uk is probably a bad example however since it is behind the Akami load balancer, this particular load balancer by the way located in the... wait for it... UK. Try www.bbc.co.uk. You would have a case if you stated that Akami was keeping the traffic data in its entirety (...lol), and the US made a request for its UK data under the US Patriot Act. Which would incur a DPA fine, but that fine is trivial compared to the punitive measures incurred under the PA.

But I will lay it down for you. When you access a UK hosted server, your traffic will go via the route established by the BGP system (usually the fastest/cheapest for the ISPs). So, for example if you were on Sky BB and were downloading a file from another Sky BB user, your traffic would never, ever, leave the Sky BB network.

If you were a Virgin user downloading a file from a Sky user, it would cross networks at somewhere like LINX. If you are a Virgin user downloading a file from a US Verizon user, then yes, your data would go first through Virgin, then through LINX, then to the East Coast of the USA and beyond.

He's not our clutch scoring threat...yet, but he's only 23 and has over 100 first-team appearances. He's only going to get better. Even Suarez needed a season or so to become, or rather to deliver, that role.

I had a similar occurrence back in July of 99. I was seeing this guy who told me he'd take me to a restaurant. He drove us there (maybe he thought I'm a bad driver cuz i'm female, but i didnt say anything about his misogyny). 

When we arrived it was raining and he said 'stay here', i froze at the spot because i thought he might rape me! He got out the car and put his umbrella up then opened my door for me and we walked to the restaurant under his umbrella. I was infuriated, I CAN OPEN DOORS MYSELF AND DONT AFRAID OF RAINDROPS! I am independent woman!

When we got too the door he opened it and let me walk through first. This only added insult to injury.

Then when I went to sit down he pulled my chair out for me! Then he wouldn't let me pay for my meal!!! I am a nurse in hospital and I look after people!! I don't need looking after!!

After this we went back to his place and he gave me some wine! We both got drunk and I pinned him down and rode him like a cowgirl. I would not do this if I wasn't drunk so he raped me because he gave me a glass of wine and I was drunk out my mind. It was a whole glass like 12% red that I'd drank, strong stuff!

I'm going to go to the european court of human rights and sue him for how he constantly degraded me that night.

Men these days are just animals, I'm a feminist and we NEED EQUAL RIGHTS NOW! Even in work my boss is a man (not woman) because the systim holds us back. ",0,1370617940,null,0,false,0,cae3ds2,t3_1fsbhf,t1_cae3ds2,t1_cadkjqx,null,1430893044,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Let's bring him in, use his help to get us to the CL a couple of seasons in a row, and he'll have been well worth the investment, even if he retires in 3 years and we don't recoup any money.

It is important to note however, that even though the USA believes it can apply it to everyone everywhere, it does not hold any sway outside of the USA.

Of course therein lies the rub. When a company is based in the EU, storing data in the US, and therefore should comply with Safe Harbor, the company is both held to US and EU member state laws.

So if the USA requested its data from the store, the company must comply. Of course in doing so, the company would incur a fine by the EU (if it ever found out), for a DPD violation. Unfortunately the EU is rarely ever likely to find out, and even if it did the DPD fine is a drop in the ocean compared to the legal costs of fighting the Patriot Act under the first amendment, or worse, having the results of non-compliance being forced on the company.

It is this contradiction between the Safe Harbour legislation and the FISA/PA that I hope kicks the EU into gear to sort it out.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; What is interesting is the voluntary nature of PRISM and the outright lying by companies such as Google who stated publicly that they had no such backdoors to US authorities.

The way I think it works is that its not a back door, they just give them the information as if the NSA server is part of Googles own server infrastructure. The term backdoor implies that they are going in and taking the data, in reality the tech companies would just be giving them everything.

As an example of how I would fag packet design this system it would be:

User sends data to Google -&gt; Google server publishes info to other subscribing servers -&gt; subscribing servers perform complex data analysis that doesn't happen in real time.

All the NSA have to do is subscribe to the publishing server. 

Basically it would be built something like this https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/

The idea that Google, or any other tech company, could have massive amounts of data going to the NSA without knowing about it is, frankly, ridiculous. These are companies that can calculate the cost of a cpu cycle in terms of power usage and know exactly how much traffic is going through their data centres, their business model depends on it. If its happening, they know about it.

If you look at the responses the tech companies have given it has been really vague like ""We do not give any direct access to our servers to third parties"" not ""we do not share information with third parties"". Its not a backdoor because the software isn't doing anything it isn't designed to do.

The idea of being able to mine this information to get anything meaningful about terrorist activities, is, however, pure science fiction. In my opinion Its probably just a massive extra judicial dick waving contest that infringes on people's privacy, very little of value could come from it because the social networking analysis isn't nearly as good as they want people to believe it is.",0,1370620031,null,0,false,0,cae45mw,t3_1fuzln,t1_cae45mw,t1_cae2a7m,null,1430892605,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Hmmmm. Not technically true, provided you limited the message monitoring to only UK users.

The original proposal of the DCB was that monitoring the network would be done at ISP level on a Deep Packet Inspection system. So when you sent a FB message in the UK, the blackbox would monitor it before it even got to Facebook.

Of course, doing it on the same level of PRISM would require the corporations help. And I am not sure how the UK gov would ever be able to get that. If they threatened monetary sanctions, the Corps would just threaten to pull out. And if they did that, GenY would riot.

Yeah, that's why I made the distinction.

&gt;As it happens though, the immigration laws have been written in such a way that they favour immigration from the wealthier (and generally ""whiter"") Commonwealth countries, because if you have a parent or grandparent born in the UK you can come here on an ancestry visa. Many Australians and Canadians (and white South Africans) meet that criteria whereas few people from the African, Asian or West Indian Commonwealth nations do.

true,C_Brooks11,eccleston,Eccleston,"This suit thing has to be THE flimsiest argument for why Tennant is going to be regular Ten and not Meta-Ten. People can buy new suits or have new suits tailored for them. A better argument would be that we've seen Ten's TARDIS. Meta-Ten was given a piece of TARDIS coral by Ten, but we don't see that (it's a deleted scene, you can watch it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcqdojFsuNo)).

Since Rose is coming back, it doesn't make sense to me why Tennant would be playing regular Ten as opposed to Meta-Ten. You could say, ""well, Eleven is still in the timestream with Hurt, and if Hurt gets out, Tennant could too."" Sure, but how does that bring Rose along? And how does Ten get a TARDIS? Aside from lazy storytelling, I also don't see it making sense.

So, here's what I'm thinking. Hurt somehow escapes the timestream. Eleven has to stop him. We are working on the theory that Hurt is a Doctor that perpetrated the genocide of the Daleks AND the Time Lords. Who else committed a genocide against the Daleks? Why, Meta-Ten and Rose Tyler! 

The Doctor can't quite come to grips with how to deal with this. But the universe has been rendered unstable by the Doctor entering his own timestream. He can reach out to Pete's World, where Rose and Meta-Ten are! Sure, Eleven has had much darker moments compared to Ten, but he hasn't done anything quite like Rose and Meta-Ten did. Meta-Ten was born in the middle of a war, much like Hurt. He knows better than anyone what Hurt would be planning- he still has all of Ten's experiences and memories, but he isn't QUITE Ten. He was born with a bit of a ruthless edge that will prove invaluable in stopping Hurt.

FFP may not matter that much, but it means that Chelsea don't have an unlimited transfer budget. Rafa Benitez hinted at £100m, so if €58 is being spent on one player then that leaves roughly £50.5m left. Were Chelsea to pursue a world class centre back, midfielder or full back then you can see the issue. Chelsea might never have publicly bailed on a deal, but I can guarantee you, behind the scenes as the Hazard transfer saga was ongoing, there would have been a number of alternatives lined up had it not gone through. 

The other thing to remember is that fans, having seen, followed and supported players developing through the club ranks often prefer to see youth promoted internally rather than a mercenary senior player shipped in. In this particular instance some fans would prefer to see Lukaku given full support by the club after he was treated appallingly when he first arrived.

All that corruption needs to thrive is innatention/apathy on the part of the public and human greed. Bildeberg exists for people to network and feel important, it's aim is not conspiracy and corruption. If someone was attempting to bribe someone why would you do it in place such as Bildeberg (where like your rivals have also been invited), you'd contact the person privately.

Next on the idea of journalistic corruption your evidence is shaky at best. The Economist is pro-Bildeberg? Not a suprise, in fact completely predictable and consistent with it's ideological viewpoint. The impression I've formed of corruption within journalism (based on my dad's experiences) insofar as it exists it is not bags of cash being handed over. It is more ""Welcome to our press meeting please enjoy this wonderful dinner and here is a gift bag containing some champagne."" Coincidentally the paper my dad worked for over many years was the Economist. When he was employed there he was contractually obliged to refuse all gifts handed out at conferences/press meetings (the more common form of mnor bribery mentioned above) and report to The Economist that such an offer was made. When the very first Blackberries were being launched he attended a conference held by the company where they gave away free the phone they just launched to all participants he reported this to The Economist and handed back. This is standard practice across most reputable newspapers. Many will not even allow prominent columnists to accept speaking engagements (often quite lucrative) in case this could be portrayed as improper influence upon the journaist.

Next press bias. Just because the press is ideologically driven does not necessarily mean it is corrputed. I will admit that there is a problem with media barons such a Rupert Murdoch exercising undue influence. However for more papers independent of these media groups such as The Economist and The Guardian they have a certain ethos that they stick to. Just becaise the paper puts a particular spin on a certain event does not mean it is being bribed to do so.

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"&gt;It's a tax grab from the poorest in society based on the politics of envy and selfishness

I don't like the HB system either, but I wouldn't call bringing social housing benefits in line with private housing benefit a tax grab (especially not being a tax). Why should the Government pay for a 3 bedroom house if you are the sole occupier, for example? There are plenty of private renters in a similar situation who only get paid for 1 room, yet no one campaigned for them.

&gt;There is a general lack of social housing stock overall, but the percentage available with multiple bedrooms is not an issue.

Well. It is. That is one of the reasons house prices are high. You are right, there is a shortage of 1 bedroom properties specifically. But, in general, there is a shortage of all housing.

&gt;It has also been shown that, in general, rents in social housing are cheaper than a comparative property in the private sector, and that there is a lack of alternative property for most of those effected to move to even if they wanted to move.

This is where I take issue. You are right, private renting is definitely more expensive. However, should the effected want to move there is available private stock. It is just the dubious matter of finding a LL willing to accept benefit claimants (something I believe should be signed into law).

--

I see your point. But I do also think people under occupying should move out, pay more themselves, or take a lodger. Regardless of whether this be London or elsewhere.

Yes the implementation is nuts, and the marketing was poor, and the eligibility criteria for extra rooms is batshit. But the principle, I think, is quite right.

true,LeTouche,num30-away,,"I believe that he is desperate to leave, he's made that clear, barely starting in this recent campaign, not playing at his best, being second fiddle to Messi etc etc. But does that mean he wants to join a club with no Champions league to offer? I don't know. It's hard to know. When the offers come in from Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool, as has been rumoured, I believe he may choose Arsenal, unless we outbid their wages. I mean, we're teams which lack a clear #9, a leading forward. We have Ade (Ade-bay-boo-bar) and JD (izzle), whilst Arse have Giroud and Podolski/Walcott (wingers who prefer the middle). Point is, if he gets to choose, Arse or the might Totties, he'll have to weigh up paycheck vs Champs league. Whether or not we can afford to out do the desire to be in CL through higher pay, I dunno. He also only has a few years left playing and will likely want to spend as much of that playing at as high a standard as possible.

Sorry for the essay!

How much? Less than 15m. Simple as that. We can get a decent youngling for about that much, Vydra, Damiao, even Benteke, and although they may not provide immediate success, which Villa could (NOT GUARANTEED), they have Levy's favourite sell on value!

He could well solve our striker problems. He's built more like JD, quick on his feet, has a good shot, a poacher really. But he also has amazing link up play, by nature of being spanish and playing spanish style possession football which Barca and Valencia both have played. So where many Spurs fans, myself included, would rather have Ade in the side, over JD, Villa possess the hold up quality of Ade, whilst maintaining the pace and urgency moving forward. (and he knows how to pass, which a certain little lad tends not to).

Honestly, I think he would fit perfectly and easily. I watched a great interview of Robbie Fowler who said that Graeme Souness, when he signed him, just told him: ""Go and score goals, we brought you here to get us goals, don't care about the teammates, just put it in the net"" (paraphrasing, mind). I really just want AVB to do the same, tell him to play his natural game, with link up, pressing high up and just getting it in the net. 


One of my favourite quotes from someone on /r/coys is: ""We need a 20 goal striker to play with our 20 goal midfielder!"" So damn true, I reckon he could be our answer.

EDIT: Forgot to add, I'm worried that playing 2nd fiddle to Bale, like how he has, Messi, will affect his decision.

AND: New training ground, new manager, new stadium, growing club, Bale, all draws.

The state of technology to implement the filtering customer-side is shockingly poor.

Oh, sure, you can run a program under Windows that implements parental controls. But the filtering on other devices such as the iPad is much poorer, and with so many homes having several devices that connect to the Internet you really want to be doing the filtering somewhere central in the household.

The obvious place to do this would therefore be on the home router.  But most home routers have little or no onboard filtering capability. Usually the best you can do is nail them to use OpenDNS' parental control filtering - which is not that sophisticated because it can't separate /r/unitedkingdom from /r/gonewild. 

(I am purposely excluding clever setups that force your own home traffic over a proxy you run yourself that implements the filtering because it's way out of the scope of what 99% of people could be expected to set up).",0,1370624109,null,0,1370624302,0,cae5q53,t3_1fsbdq,t1_cae5q53,t1_cadg2ef,null,1430891866,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I hope that, because I agree that he could fit in perfectly with us.  If it gets to the point where we have to out pay Arsenal, I don't think it's a realistic option anymore.  Having paid off their stadium, I think they have the funds to get Villa if they want him.  

However, them having cash to splash also means that they may go for someone above our price range anyway.  While I don't like the idea of Arsenal getting someone like Jovetic, I'd rather have them get him and us get Villa, as opposed to them getting Villa and us getting no one.  

As far as age goes, I don't think he's the kind of striker that relies on his pace.  Even though he's getting near the end of his physical prime, I think his positioning and link up play will be more than enough to make up for any loss of physical skills.  I also think it would take the pressure off of us to sign a young up and comer.  If we were to bring in Villa early, we could afford to wait.

true,Madfish1,,Whitehead,"I live just around the corner from Lestannon Avenue... The estate (Ransevyn) is just at the bottom of Lestannon Avenue (And more or less directly across from me), but I've never really had any trouble around it. Not to say there's absolutely no trouble around it, I just haven't personally noticed anything properly leaking from it and into surrounding areas.

Come to think of it, I have an old friend to lives/used to Live on Lestannon Avenue.. They're nice houses, good open space around them and I know that that area and the surrounding roads are pretty quiet

Now overall in my opinion of living here for more or less 19 years is that Whitehead tends to be a pretty quiet town with really the only trouble happening around the train station in the late evening (And probably around the parks/football pitches in the evening). Probably some trouble around the estate, but I've barely noticed it. To be honest, I quite like it here... but then again I would probably have a bias towards it.

You've got the basic needs within a 10 minute walk (post office, shops, chemists, doctors surgeries and all that). Plus Larne and Carrick are just up the road and easy to get to if you drive or take the train or anything, so Whitehead puts you nicely in between the two towns

As for a drug problem... personally... I've never really heard of it being mentioned, Although I know that there used to be a very bad problem... Not much now, if it's still a problem. Then it's a problem behind closed doors... Unlikely you'll notice anything in the way of drugs

---------------------------------------

[](/sp)

Overall, It's a nice town in my opinion (alhough there's probably a bias with me) I haven't had any trouble and most people here seem to be dead on...

Look at our transfer history.  According to transfermarkt, we spent on players:

12/13 64 million


11/12 7.4 million


10/11 23 million


09/10 35 million

08/09 125 million

07/08 83 million

etc etc.

One year alone we haven't spent over 20 million all the way back to 2002.  Most of those years we also had sales to help fund, but we're usually a few million in the negative.

true,marquis_of_chaos,null,null,"&gt; Why should the Government pay for a 3 bedroom house if you are the sole occupier, for example? 

Because social housing rents don't work like private rents. The average social housing rent is approximately 68% that of a private sector renting. Why move people from cheaper social housing to more expensive private rented property that is also less secure for the tenants? Overcrowding in social housing is a London problem not a nationwide issue. As many councils/H.A's have said, it's not a problem of overcrowding it's an issue of not having enough housing overall. Pushing people from house to house doesn't solve the problem and is just an exercise in bureaucracy.

&gt; There are plenty of private renters in a similar situation who only get paid for 1 room, yet no one campaigned for them.

That's the divisive politics of envy. We should be aiming to raise everyone up to a reasonable standard not pulling down those who might be perceived to have slightly better circumstances. The fact that private sector tenants may have unsuitable homes is not reason to penalise those that do. It is surely a reason however to regulate the rental market so that people are not being exploited by landlords.

&gt; ..private renting is definitely more expensive. However, should the effected want to move there is available private stock.,[...] But I do also think people under occupying should move out, pay more themselves, or take a lodger. Regardless of whether this be London or elsewhere.

So people should move into more expensive private rentals, or pay more ....just because? The whole idea has just created problems were there were previously non for purely ideological reasons. If the problem is really supposed to tackle the benefits bill then why force people into more expensive private rental property? If it was to tackle overcrowding/under occupancy then why treat the whole of the UK as one and not tackle the problem on a local level, and why not commit to a social housing massive building programme?

true,not_shakey_byrne,,Leeds - GSXR1000k7 / Duc 996,"My pack is a Deuter Attack and I absolutely adore it.

It's got a built in back-protector, hydro pack and helmet carrier system. It's very aerodynamic, comfortable and extremely hardwearing. I've recently had a crash, I landed on my head and rolled a few times. The back protector totally did its job. The bag not only protected me but took a battering protecting my leathers too. I landed about 40mph head-&gt;back -&gt; slide -&gt; roll -&gt; back. Only noticeably damage is a 3cm tear in in the front but the rip-stop material kept it that size, lots of scrapes but a thorough wash and it look pretty good again - was three years old before the accident. The bag is totally usable again and my leather are unmarked - my helmet was an absolute write off. 

I'm not convinced they still make the exact model anymore, but they do make and ""Attack 20"" [0] but the shape looks a bit larger and its got pockets mine hasn't.

This would make sense because as much as I love it, mine doesn't hold a great deal. I could well see someone else getting pissed off with how little it carries. For example even starting empty I don't think a laptop would go in, certainly a 17"" mac book pro doesn't even fit through the top zip. I've a cheapo 2L hyrdro too and if that is full about half the space in the main compartment is already gone.

I use it as a *man-bag*, wallet/phone/keys/small tool roll/hoodie/beanie/drink but after that its not interested in carrying much else. But I literally have it with me all the time now - wherever a girl might have a handbag or purse I've my backpack - so its smaller size is real plus for me.

I've used mine for a few different sports m/c (obv), snowboarding, longboard skate, road bike, mountain bike etc etc. Its size makes a real difference here because its so nonrestrictive. Maybe doesn't matter so much for the m/c but I've snowboarded with other packs and got sick of them in the first hour. I don't even notice the deuter - well not until I wipeout, bounce back up and think ""f**k that should have hurt a lot more than that ... ahh hang on"". The other good thing about it is I can wear it on the m/c when I've got a pillion and it doesn't get in the pillion's way - if anything she prefers it because she sometimes uses it's straps to hold on.

The new one looks a lot bigger probably addressing the issue above. If you want a m/c pack I think might be a plus but if you use it like i do I think its a minus.

true,letsgolakers24,null,null,"Barca fan here from /r/Barca. I think with more playing time he can regain his pre-injury form for sure. 31 is a bit old for a football player, but he still has some good years ahead of him. For you all, of course it depends on if Bale leaves, but I think Villa is a good acquisition either way. He can play as a #9 or on the wing and can put up a solid 15 goal season if he starts consistently (over Adebayor or Defoe). He is a short term solution however, I don't think he will play at a high level for more than 2-3 years. 

He definitely is not going to start at Barca next year, with us getting Neymar and still having Alexis/Pedro and a developing Tello/Deulofeu. I want to see him become successful elsewhere because the talent is there. He did miss a few sitters and easy shots at the end of the season though, but it shouldn't be much of a concern. 

I think Barca will ask for &amp;#8364;15 million for transfer. We are short on money to try and purchase a CB, as we did (IMO) overspend a bit on Neymar. 

Tottenham is my favorite Premiership team, so I hope he is successful if he transfers here.

I think this could be the case and people seem to forget pretty quickly how good he was for us in prior seasons.

I think Rose could go either way at this point. Many Sunderland fans will tell you that he was their best player this year but how hard is it to stand out in a relegation fighting club? I think the quality is there but his mentality could be an issue (seems to feed off of confidence and the pressure at Spurs is higher than at Sunderland).

I honestly don't know much about Zeki Fryers and whether or not he'll be any good for us. I don't think United would have let him go if he was top four quality but they have been wrong about youngsters before (ex. Pogba).

And I'm not completely sold on Luke Shaw yet. It'd be an awful career move to leave the Saints this summer. He'll progress and improve much more if he stays there for another season or two.

This is one of my biggest issues with Lucas. His tackles per game stats cause people to overrate him. Good player, but he wasn't very good when he came back this year, bar one or 2 games. He chases the ball instead using his positional skills to intercept the ball or to funnel the opposition into an better suited area, while waiting for help from the rest of the team. He often overcommits himself, missing a tackle or being passed around, leaving the rest of the defense exposed. With Gerrard's aging legs and the lack of pace between Agger and Carra, it was often a recipe for disaster this past season. There were huge gaps in the midfield left by Lucas, or Gerrard, whenever the overcommitted themselves and that's why we were destroyed by counter attacking teams.

That's also another reason why I'm excited the by the prospect of Mkhitaryan. He would offer the energy and defensive pressing that Henderson does with much, much better offensive abilities. I can easily see a midfield trio of Gerrard, Lucas, and Coutinho being overrun by better opposition. If we had Mkhitaryan at AM and moved Coutinho to LW, giving him less defensive responsibilities, then we would be much more solid defensively IMO.",0,1370628889,null,0,false,0,cae7nk6,t3_1fupve,t1_cae7nk6,t1_cae226a,null,1430890958,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Our owners did well with refurbing Fenway - not because of adding more seats, but by keeping people at the stadium longer. You've seen Anfield fifteen minutes before and after the game, it's a ghost town. Get people to make a day of it, open up pubs, shops and restaurants. Get them to spend more at the game instead of the culture of pre-drinking before the game and getting a cab just before kick-off.

The pros: an extremely intelligent player, makes great off the ball runs and links up well with teammates, good passer. Hard-working player who will always fight for his spot. Excellent finisher, though he's missed a few recent chances. Not gonna lie, he's disappeared in a few important games when we needed him.

My other concern is that it's been a while since he played as a pure 9, he's spent the vast majority of his last three years cutting in from the wing - he is not cut out to play on the wing at Spurs, but while in theory he's obviously a striker, it has been a while since he played a purely central position. That said, in the EPL where there's more open space to work with, and not playing alongside Messi, I think Villa could really thrive. The one thing is certain, he'll give it everything he has, the guy lives and breathes football.

I'll start off by saying Villa is my favorite player in soccer so I am biased.

&gt;Do you think he is a reasonable target? Can we get him here, and does he want to come?

Yes I believe from all the rumors that Villa is at the point where he cares about just playing the game of soccer. He has all the hardware he could ever want and with sitting out an entire year and seeing limited time this year; he knows he's got little time left. Only concern is whether Barca will sell him. People believe with Neymar signing he's gone but people don't realize he is Barca's only option at the 9 if Messi can't go. Cesc can play there but not against CL quality.

&gt;How much do you think we should pay if we are to target him?

I would say the price would be in the range of 15mill if he were to be sold.

&gt;Do you think he can solve our striker problems(at least short term)?
Finally, how do you believe he would fit in with our current team?

I am still under the impression that Villa could be a top striker for a couple years still. His game isn't based on speed it's about timing and technical ability. I don't watch many Tottenham games so I am not sure how he will fit but I can tell you what he does best. One thing that rarely if ever gets seen is Villa's off the ball runs especially the ones when you are just starting your attack. He is always looking to break the back line and usually finds the right angles. Barca has slow build up so these runs by Villa are very rarely seen unless you are focusing on him.

 Scoring wise I don't think you can find a player who can score in as many ways as Villa does. Defense is sitting back holding a lead and only giving you openings for long shots? Villa has made some of the best GK look silly with his accuracy from just outside the box.(He is the reason RB + B is was over powering in Fifa last year) CL finals vs ManU/ Vander Sar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcSZiNSlgE. His very next goal the following season against RM in a game where RM destroyed barca the entire game and then this happens(vs Casillas) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxmq2_pj_OE (Bonus here Ray Hudson goes nuts). Another thing that gets forgotten about with Villa playing at Barca is his freekicks. You will see him trying to talk Xavi / Messi into letting him take a few but they never allow him. Here is my favorite freekick of his for Spain. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF89T9_nx8U. Also you can add to the list of him basically having 2 dominant feet. He broke his right leg as a child so his dad made him play with his left basically making his left foot just as good as his right. When he finally saw playing time this season I believe 4 of his first 5 goals were left footed. As well as only having 1 shot off target at this point in the season.(A shame the benched him constantly for out of form Alexis and Pedro, only to later play an out of form Villa over an inform Alexis.) 

He can also be selfless. Playing in the barca style has really shown his willingness to pass. He has had amazing 1,2s but at the same time he will also dribble himself into trouble more then he should. Also while being in the barca system he has become a better Winger even though his best position still lies centrally. He can also play on either side early at barca he saw more of the right side then he does now but he still played well on each side. Scary thought while typing this is Villa / Bale standing over a free kick side note I really hope to see Bale stay. Would also like to hear what you Spurs fans have to say about Villa's style and the style you guys play.

Shevchenko was 29 when we bought him - too old. and Torres was recovering from injury and never even had a medical test before joining. turns out he never fully recovered to his old ways and we wasted a lot of money. this however is different. right now we are severely lacking options up front! Torres and Ba are just not god enough. nor is Lukaku. yet. so why not buy one of the worlds best strikers? he will provide us with the goals that we need to succeed this year! unless of course you're telling me that it is impossible to buy talented players to score goals. this is of course accept for Ronaldo, Falcao, RVP, Suarez, Ibrahimovic, Ozil, Alonso, Mata, Hazard, Luiz, etc. because the only good players in the world are home grown players who are never bought by other clubs for large amounts of money.

In this case, to move a family from unsuitable housing to fully occupy the under-occupied home.

&gt;Overcrowding in social housing is a London problem not a nationwide issue.

While I appreciate the problem is particularly acute in London, it does exist nationwide.

&gt;So people should move into more expensive private rentals, or pay more ....just because?

I don't personally think social renters should go into private rentals (I think all long term HB renters should be in social housing), but the government clearly does. As I said, I merely don't see anything inherently unfair about only paying for rooms required.

Sure, it would be nice to elevate everyone to the same level as social renters, but apparently this is just not possible from a cost perspective.

&gt;If the problem is really supposed to tackle the benefits bill then why force people into more expensive private rental property?

Slight false dichotomy. The idea as I understand it is to reduce the benefits bill and be fairer, not force people into private housing. That is just a possible natural consequence of this poor implementation and a lack of social housing in general.

&gt;If it was to tackle overcrowding/under occupancy then why treat the whole of the UK as one and not tackle the problem on a local level

Because it does exist elsewhere. And, unfortunately, that would lead to areas which offer better or worse standards than others, and that is unfair. Besides, councils in general are not very competent.

&gt;why not commit to a social housing massive building programme?

Ultimately, because that is not the ideology of this Government. It would much rather prefer to reduce the social housing stock as much as possible.

Ideally we would be financially independent, spewing out top youth players, having a stable manager, winning every trophy under the sun, playing beautiful football with a squad that are entertaining and a fanbase who have a great attitude. Tensions arise when we have to trade off one ""success"" for another.

At the end of the day all that matters is that we support the club so that they have the opportunity to attain whatever goal it is we hope for.

If you came to me for a loan I would want to know why money was being paid into your account and out of it on the same day or thereabouts. One of the main 'scams' at present is whereby criminals are having people who believe it's a legitimate job (they target students/unemployed) to pay money into their own account and then transfer it to another (therefore layering) and integrating it into society. Now you might think 'hey I can prove it's just me to me' but it's the bank representatives legal responsibility to report you to their money laundering team/police WITHOUT tipping you off. If you were a criminal and I tipped you off in such a way it carries a custodial sentence, so you better bet I'll report it if I see the signs.

He refused to join us multiple times from Athletico, heck that's why we are lumbered with him now. Abram wanted his prize for his money, he'd be damned if money couldn't get him everything he wanted. Now he has his prize and looks pretty damn foolish. Forcing him out would be the ultimate swallowing of pride and would show to me that we have a true owner who I could respect and trust in. 

I suppose Torres could pull a Malouda but I think he does enjoy his football more than Malouda, and on that note Malouda probably would have been a better squad member than Yossi but that was probably someone somewhere making a point.

Also if we kept Torres as a squad player, would he be happy? Would Roman demand he plays? I see him as a major obstacle between Managers and the Board and also between other players. It doesn't encourage competition for places if he ""has"" to play either because Roman says so or the Manager feels he has to play someone the club have paid £50 million for. It's this disruption that annoys me perhaps more than actually keeping him. If I believed he wanted to be at Chelsea and that he was ok being a rotation option until he deserved it then I would be ok but he doesn't appear to want to improve or work on his game. If anything his touch and ball skills are worse but what has he done to compensate? Has he gained any strength?

I guess we could give him some time under Mou to see if he can force him to train hard to get where he used to be. This is chiefly why I favour players like Ronaldo and Bale to Messi, they show how much you can achieve in training, what you can improve, how to be physically the best. That example in training has to be inspiring to other squad members and the youth team. Torres at the moment seems like the anti-thesis. This is not to say that he doesn't close down on the pitch, but half a game of football is won off the pitch. The training and preparation are just as important as the actual day (aside from Refs ahahaa).

The National Housing Federation says that ""..in the North of England, under-occupation exceeds overcrowding by a ratio of 3:1"". So while overcrowding is technically an issue it's not quite the problem the government would have you believe. It can be managed much better at a local level rather than by diktat from above. While allowing local control over the issues might ""lead to areas which offer better or worse standards than others"" it's still central government creating a problem and then applying a one size fits all policy.

Cavani is a great player, but I'm still confident Torres is up there with him in terms of potential. Falcao and Ibrahimovich to me, are in their own league, and I would love to have them on the team, but Cavani? I don't want a 26 year old who never proved anything outside of Italy...unless he costs less than 10-15 million. 
Actually, I think the last thing we need is a new high profile striker. Lukaku, Torres, and Ba are three completely different strikers in a class of their own. Ba is an aerial threat with a sick volley; Torres is a deep lying forward who can play provider; and Lukaku is a power house who can play poacher, target man and provider. Plus we have a foot in the door at Leverkussen about to sign Schurrle? Theres another versatile forward who can do everything Cavani does, and more. I guess we should wait and see how Jose approaches this situation, but I just don't want Cavani.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;In any case what you are suggesting isn't affecting any change. You're just avoiding it yourself. What about all the less tech savvy people who don't know how to encrypt all their communication? Ignore them? They don't deserve protection?

Well, let's look at this in more depth.  All the tools I emailed to you are free, so it's not a question of prohibitive cost: everyone who wants to use encryption and other privacy tools can afford to use them.  So, the system is easily managed on a voluntary basis: whoever wants to keep their email private can do so, whoever doesn't feel it's that important to them is free to just keep on posting without thinking about it.  

Now, I understand your point, not everyone is tech savvy.  So, it's a matter of usability, not cost.  You claim that these people's cause will be helped through voting.  But, as we can see, the internet has gone from being something that wasn't easy to use 20 years ago (less than .2% of us had email in 1993, for example) to something that is increasingly easy.  And, very importantly, it has managed to do so without any government interference at all.  The entire field of interface usability has emerged out of the market system itself: people have a need, someone answers that need and makes a buck out of it.  Think how easy some things are to do online compared to even 5 years ago, just because someone invented an app.

I argue that you will do far, far more for the less tech savvy people simply by teaching them how to do it, perhaps in a YouTube video or in a class, than by voting to get government out of our emails.  It's just a question of getting better results for your efforts.

Regarding the issue of governments attempting to annihilate a minority group.  My father (I'm not English, by the way, I just happen to write it quite well...) was in a very unfortunate position during the war.  I assure you that nobody thought of stopping the evils of big government by voting (in fact, both the Nazis and the Fascists were very popular movements...), but chose instead to fight the system through underground activity, resistance, etc.  Realise, too, that taking Jewish people to the ghetto and then to Auschwitz was relatively easy: in many places government simply had to look at the records people had registered themselves, to see who was a Jew and who wasn't.

To summarise: I view the idea of voting and pleading for government to please give us our freedom and privacy as something similar to a black slave being perfectly able to run away from the plantation, but somehow feeling compelled to ask the slave master if he would please let him go.

I agree with you, but it brings me back to something I've been thinking about for a while.

So, I know what he's said in the past, but what if Verts moved over? I say this because, even though it may not be his preferred position, I genuinely think he could be one of the best LBs in the world.

Examples could include a milder winter, or conversely, a harsher winter that led to better salting of the roads.  Perhaps putting a camera in place has altered the flow of traffic, so that more accidents happen elsewhere. 

Choosing pro and anti camera people to discuss this is an awful way of debating it - what you need is a reasonable discussion of the published data to see if what it claims is valid.  A neutral statistician might not have been exciting, but would've been more valuable. 

The ideal would be if the police turned off cameras in an effort to accumulate data for the same intersection with and without the camera and investigate the use of cameras scientifically in order to maximise their effect.  Alas, an evidence-based approach to an emotional argument is clearly too much to ask.

In the time and place when these particular farm workers lived there was great competition for jobs and wages kept going down and down. So they did what most people would do, they banded together to help each other out. They formed what was then called a friendly society.

One landowner got upset about this and wrote to his MP and the upshot is that these guys got fucked over and were transported to Australia for 7 years.

These people are known today by the name of the Tolpuddle Martyrs. And it's because of them and people like 'em that we have trade unions. Are some of us going to get fucked over? Yeah. But there's too damn many of us, if ordinary people all start using encryption and vpn's and whatnot.

Because computers and algorithms can crunch the data but bodies to mete out oppression are something that they're short of. And the way they're treating the police they're going to be less and less willing to do the dirty work for 'em.

The fullbacks and centerbacks all played a deep line, dropping off and covering for Lucas, allowing him to roam and disrupt their attack. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't like he was roaming in the opponents half, but since we sat back a lot, he roamed around in between our 18 yard box and the half way line.

He's a good player and if he recovers his form from 11/12 then I think we'll be ok, but he really wasn't very good when he came back this year. It just annoyed me a little that people claimed he was back to best by citing his tackles per game and the improvement our defense made when he returned.

true,fishysticky,null,null,"I guess it varies by schools but in my first primary school, we didn't really learn much History until yr2 which was on Florence Nightingale because it fitted in to our termly topic of medicine. Kinda dark for an infant class. 
In yr3, our History throughout the year was about the Romans. 
From year 4, we didn't have a certain history topic that stayed the same throughout the year, instead it was termly. Here we did the Egyptians, the Tudors, and the Georgians.
I left that school at the end of year 4 but I would've done ww2 if i had stayed.

In yr 5, my topic was on the overseas trade of the early British empire, about 1400-1600, emphasising on sir Francis Drake. In year 6, we studied the Spartans, just the Spartans, nobody else in ancient Greece, we got to choose which part we studied and I chose the military side of it.

When you reach highschool, KS3 is normally Medieval England. The events leading up to and the result of the Norman conquest in yr7.  The industrial revolution in yr8.  For the first hakf of the year in yr9, we were taught about the slave trade and thr basics of the causes of the first world war in the second half.  

What you are taught in GCSE depends on the school, each school chooses 2 of 6 units to teach. Mine chose units one (the roaring 20s, thr great depression, and FDR's ""3 Rs"") on the first year and unit 2 (causes of the first world war, the treaty of versailles, Hitler's rise to power and how he maintained a doctatorship).   

You have more choice of field if you take History at A-level as you can do European History, ancient civilisations and world History. I'm sure there are more choices but again, it depends on the college.

Lukaku coming back and the Cavani rumor puts Torres on the bench, maybe even not on the bench if Lukaku is so sure about coming back after speaking with Mourinho. That means Torres leaving? Maybe. Which fullfilled 50% of the speculation that Mourinho is listening to offers for Mata and Torres.

The fact is none of us know if he'll ever be good enough to play for Liverpool; we just know that he isn't right now. I personally believe that his raw talent exceeds that of a lot of our current squad players - Downing, Henderson, Lucas even - but he's just so unpolished that he only shows it sporadically.

true,HiHaterslol,lfc68,,"**For:** A full season loan to a lower premier league team.

I'm amazed by the short memories people seem to have. Toward the beginning of the season, there were ""The Dark Lord's power is growing"" threads every day. Even I don't remember when I did it, but in tribute, I named my VP on FIFA Jonjo (then my last name).

Ever since the United game where he got sent off, he's declined. No denying that.

true,Let-them-eat-cake,null,null,"&gt; I'm merely arguing that the idea of global conspiracy is completely implausible.

Agreed to a point (see below). I said in my previous comment there are differing factions who sometimes fight and sometimes collude, I expand on this below.

&gt; Next on the idea of journalistic corruption your evidence is shaky at best.

It's either corruption, collusion or abject incompetence - one or all of these shows the MSM should be treated like the entertainment it is - not fact based news/information.

Firstly, LIBOR - no investigation done by the MSM until it was obvious -as I mentioned in the previous comment, this was being written about by non-MSM well before 2008? Also, why is the MSM not calling for Geithner, Greenspan, Bernanke and other central bankers heads?

Iraq invasion - Tim Robbins the actor/director prior to the illegal invasion counted how many ""experts"" the US MSM had on that were pro and against (I can't find the link unfortunately, but it'll be there with some time spent), he counted roughly 600 were pro war and less than 10 were against it. Which ever way you look at it, there was some bias there...

Was it a conspiracy prior to the illegal Iraq invasion, when 'dissenters' and 'looney liberals' said there were no WMDs? Clare Short lost her job, a million people marched on parliament, MI6 said there were no WMDs - yet Blair/Bush invaded illegally anyway and there were no WMDs. As an aside, the David Kelly investigation was a terrible and sad indictment on the UK legal system - and 'oddly' the files have been put away for decades as they're 'not in the public interest'. No red flag there?

Is it an ongoing MSM conspiracy of silence or just incompetence that no mention has been made that Tony Blair and Bush Jr have been tried and convicted of war crimes in Malaysia (using the same rules as the Nazis after WW2). Is it a conspiracy that they have not been tried in other countries? I believe Switzerland has done something similar as Bush won't travel there.

""Conspiracy"" is a word with different meanings depending on which side you're on, but history is chock full of ""conspiracies"" that were true. Most recently the NSA spying on whatever they can get their listeners on [Hi NSA :) ]

It was a 'conspiracy' before the US IRS was caught out auditing Obama's political enemies.

Behghazi and CNN, which I linked in the previous comment is another one.

It was a conspiracy when non MSM journalists were saying the FBI were the ones creating and abetting 'terrorist acts' on US soil -the NYT times article put that to bed saying 12 out of the last 22 acts of terrorism were created, financed and abetted by the FBI.

&gt; shaky at best

Investigate further yourself - my previous comment said this is the tip of the iceberg and what I've pointed out at the very least, should raise red flags as to the MSM's allegiances and agenda.

&gt; Bildeberg exists for people to network and feel important, it's aim is not conspiracy and corruption.

&amp;

&gt; Finally you have yet to reply directly to my questions on the practicality of gobal conspiracy and the reliability of Estulin.

A lot more goes on as you describe, but there is collusion whether it's at Bilderberg or not - and my previous comment backs this with links and obviously the oil price as one major example. Further investigation of Estulin's work and Jim Tucker's previous reporting will expand on this. Also, the US has the Logan act that should stop US politicians going to Bilderberg.

Mentioning Bilderberg was for ""wacky conspiracy theorists"" and denied for decades - and deliberately(?) ignored by the MSM, including the Economist - why? For the good of humanity or for them to gain yet more control, power and wealth in privacy? 

David Rockerfeller a regular attendee and criminal (see his funding of Pinochet's genocide in Argentina at the least), among many other elite families, said [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-flynt/common-sense-2009_b_264706.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-flynt/common-sense-2009_b_264706.html):

&gt; “We are on the verge of a global transformation. All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order.”

Also from his memoirs:

&gt; ""Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure -- one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.""

Is it a global conspiracy? Well Rockerfeller thinks it is. The Russians and Chinese disagree I believe, but play along for their own benefit. One question worth asking is why are Russia, China and East Asia buying as much gold as they can get their hands on? Do they know something's up with the US$ and western fiat currencies in general?

In the West powers that be, if you're on the inside, it's collusion and a nice pay packet - being on the outside and the results affect you negatively, but there's only circumstantial evidence to internal collusion, then it's a 'conspiracy' - question it and you're shouted down and branded a 'conspiracy theorist' by the MSM - that attends Bilderberg. Red flag?

Understanding the world around us is difficult, confusing and predominantly based on internal brain chemistry, education, knowledge, experience, religion(?) and external circumstance. A study I read recently showed different brain chemical reactions between self described conservative and liberal thinkers to the same stimuli. So, i'm aware different people take the same information in different ways - however the facts and results are plain once investigated thoroughly - which includes dismissing most of the opinion, unbacked by facts on the internet and distilling what can be *proven* as true. 

The filters I personally use to understand the human world are psychological, i.e. ""propaganda works"", ""follow the money"", ""power corrupts"", ""money is the root of all evil"", Sturgeon's law (basically 90% of people are crap at their job) and that when someone's belief system is questioned (based on demonstrable facts or not), the chemicals released in the brain are the same as when we're physically attacked. I've used these as a filter for work, life and trading decisions during my adult life - nothing that's happened in that time has shown them to be wrong. I say 'wrong' because that is the way the west/Anglo saxon world leaders (aristocracy, business and political) live - they are and have been been for centuries, greedy, self serving and lacking in any compassion or empathy. And often psychopaths who commit, encourage or at least turn a blind eye to genocide for personal gain - the British empire being a major contributor.

Countries like Thailand, Tibet, Nepal and many indigenous cultures have compassion, empathy and balance with nature as their founding principles - something the west could really do with looking at, sooner rather than later. It's either that or self destruction in a blaze of propaganda, greed, consumption and warmongering.

I'm sure given the current small but growing global uprising against long held power structures, that Orwell would say, ""I told you so"".

Whether it's River shooting him, or River poisoning him, or sacrificing himself (the flesh version, at least) or any of the other times he's nearly been killed or killed himself. He's gone nearly death-for-death with Rory. I get the feeling that he wants to be punished for what he had to do in the Time Way.

All that to say, I warmed up to him fairly quickly. The only criticism I had was that he was *too* much like Tennant. But I think he's moved away from that. And I hope the next Doctor brings something a bit new to the series (I know it's unlikely, but I'd really like to see Eddie Izzard in the role.)",0,1370672718,null,0,false,0,caelkrq,t3_1fwsgz,t1_caelkrq,t3_1fwsgz,null,1430884314,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Earliest I can remember is Year 2 where the main thing was Victorian Britain, and I guess a bit on the industrial revolution as well.

Year 3 was definitely Romans and possibly ancient Egypt as well. 

Year 4 I can't remember too well but I remember doing a section on the history of Iraq, as this was when British troops were just being deployed there.

Year 5 was more Victorian stuff I believe,but in a bit more detail (being 10 by this point, rather than 6).

Year 6 I remember being a bit of a mish of things. I remember there being s bit of Romans, a bit of WW2 (in particular the home front).

Secondry school starts at this point so things get a bit more varied and have more subjects per year here generally.

Year 7 included Ancient China, the Norman conquest and the build up to it. We also studied the hundred years war with a good chunk on agincourt, crecy and poitiers.

Year 8 was the development of the slave trade, industrial revolution and the French revolution.

Year 9 was (I think) Tudor Britain and the reformation, and the civil war.

Year 10 and 11 (so GCSEs) were built around the exams/coursework, so it was the western front in WW1 (in particular the Somme), the development of the social state under Lloyd George, a section on the Russian revolution and the deaths of the Tsar and family. We also studied the home front in WW2, as well as the League of Nations and Wiemar Germany.

AS we studied a large unit on Henry VIII with a good chunk on the break with Rome and the reformation. We then studied 2 smaller sections on the civil rights movement in the USA and Stalinist Russia.

A2 was 2 large units one for cwk and the other for exams. The coursework element was a question of our choosing on an aspect of the crusades up till the end of the Third Crusade or so (there was an exact year but it was 2 years ago and I can't remember). Exam was on the cold war, and so could be about anything within that so we studied it all from the end of the war right through till the collapse of the USSR in 91.


So yeah, there's a rough idea of what I did in history at school. lots of interesting stuff, as well as some dull stuff (looking at you Lloyd George), but there's still a lot of stuff I'd have liked to have studied, such as the peninsular war.

As /u/tbiz12 mentioned below:

&gt;He just turned 21. How many players peak at 21? How many players at 21 look like they'll be great but turn out terrible?

I agree. I think the age thing is something we quickly forget with Jonjo especially contrasted with the brilliance that the 20-year-old (soon to be 21) Coutinho. But who is to say that Coutinho will show the same brilliance week-in, week-out over the course of a Premier League season? There's also the infamous Bale-for-Downing column and look how that has turned out. And remember how Lucas was shite until the last couple seasons or so.

Given the same chances, maybe Jonjo could be a brilliant player.

(Then again, I do understand that Coutinho took what little chances he received early on and parlayed that into a starting XI position week-in, week-out whereas Jonjo has seemingly bottled every chance he gets. I think it's a mental thing but that's a comment for another time).

I run through the following debate in my head:

* Given the chance, Jonjo could succeed.
* But can he be given the chances at Liverpool FC where - especially after the summer transfer dust has settled - he may simply be the odd man out?
* But he's 21-years-old so we can't necessarily give up on him.

So, the logical answer - to me - is to send him out on a season-long loan with a Premier League club (like a Norwich and not a Championship side) and see what he can do week-in and week-out. Then next summer we re-evaluate what Jonjo can do for us. Perhaps he could be a valuable addition to a League and/or Cup squad if we're battling in the Champions League in '14/'15.

Even the most placid of people (me included) will be at the front of the crowd when the revolution comes.

We really need to start getting politically involved and holding our respective representatives accountable. Don't think you have to change the world, just think locally. See what votes are coming up and contact your local representative and say, if you vote this or that way in the upcoming parliament vote, you will not be getting my vote in the next local/general elections.

What makes someone a conspiracy nut?

Why do we have derogatory terms for people who are after an alternative truth? What is the truth? Do you know the truth? If you don't know the truth, what gives you the right to use derogatory terms against people like him? He may rant a bit, but you can ignore those, like you may read in between the lines when listening to/reading main stream news. 

He may not be 100% factual about what he says, but is that enough to use derogatory terms against him?

I'm not sticking him up for him or attacking you, I'm just wondering where you draw the line, where do you get your truths from? Why is the shallow depth of news we receive Every. Single. Minute. Of. The. Day. sufficient? Why is it, when people try to look to join the dots, either correctly or incorrectly, they're some kind of nut.

Why can't we have a more positive term for people who are after an alternative truth but may not have all their facts correct and may go off on a bit of a rant.

My main problem with society is the divide and conquer attitude. That's why I don't like negative labels for people. They may be different to you, they may think differently to you, but do we need to be derogatory towards them? I'd like to think not. I think we can still live with these people if we used more positive terms for them. Converse with them, don't deride them. That's the world I want to live in.

I don't think that warrants doing the same thing to ourselves. The Chinese State does not work in the interests of its own people, as demonstrated, as most democracies should be doing by definition.

If China is able to steal secret data simply by dragnet surveillance, then there is something wrong, something that needs to be fixed, in the Governments' cryptosystems and methods of storage and communication. If this is happening, then secret methods of communicating and storing data are not fulfilling their purpose. 

If it is a case of infiltration, then it is just old style espionage, and we are already probably doing the same to them.

Prism is/was based on the fact that Internet traffic takes the cheapest, fastest path across the network, [likely t](http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/public-sector/International%20Internet%20Regional%20Bandwidth%20Capacity%20in%202001%20-%20National%20Security%20Agency%20-%20Telegeography%20Research.png)o[ be thr](http://ansonalex.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/underwater-internet-cable-map.jpg?d5aadb)o[ugh ~~Cthulhu~~  the US](http://www.telegeography.com/assets/website/images/maps/global-traffic-map-2010/global-traffic-map-2010-x.jpg), not through Asia, when sent from one geographic region to any other. All of the companies targeted were those that deal with most of the world's data. If China are doing the **same thing**, their results would be minimal in comparison, and probably only limited to Baidu, Weibo, and a few others.

edit: Also, I hope and pray that this whole NSA scandal will bring people to know the dangers of storing data across jurisdictions. I hope it creates borders for personally owned data, so that it can be better protected (i.e. stored in your house, on your network), and I hope it pushes more people into adopting open source and cryptographic methods to protect themselves, and those experienced in software development to develop such methods further. And that people are wary of what they send across public networks, even if it's encrypted.

If that happens, China isn't so much of a worry any more. /edit",0,1370690237,null,0,1370706007,0,caenugp,t3_1furcr,t1_caenugp,t1_caemiw0,null,1430883244,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We've had Gypsies set up near us about 5/6 times, and without fail the site is always a trash pile once they get moved on. It's so disrespectful. 

&gt;Nor can anyone complain to local news because it promotes racism

If successful you'll receive a reduced amount to ""tide you over"" until your JSA is restored.

Estimated number of victims: 95,000      
Number of convictions for rape: 1070

An interesting statistic.

Accounting for an under-reporting from male victims (which I believe is because of a feeling of emasculation and shame), the number of assaults on females is much higher: between 366,000 and 422,000 compared to 54,000 and 99,000 male victims - pretty much the same ratio for rape, which is included here as ""the most serious sexual assault"".

So it is clear men do get raped, but by UK law it [requires a penis](http://www.rapecrisis.org.uk/rapeampsexualviolence2.php) (I'm not equating penis with man here either but it is clear that women born in male bodies are not in the majority when it comes to rapists). So it is also clear that here the statistics only include rape by men - up to 19,000 men get raped by other men per year. 

*Otherwise* it's included as assault by penetration, which is at 4,000 victims per year. Even then that doesn't necessarily all include women. So there are, out of *at least* 54,000 sexual assaults on men, *at most (being very generous here)* 4,000 'rapes' by women, with an estimated total of 19,000 rapes by other men.

But I'm interested to know why you wanted the citation out of me and not the first guy who makes a wild generalisation about an international movement.

true,PopeTheoskeptik,eng-northumberland,North of The Wall,"I'm a bit unsure why councils have this thing about grouping travellers into one site. The increase in density seems to cause more problems that smaller sites with one or two caravans/RVs dotted here and there instead of creating some kind of ghetto.

&gt;the Winchester Council representative was there just to say 'we're going to do it anyway, there's noting you can do, get on with it'

This is what planning officers often claim, though not in as many words. But it's not true, you can try and influence events, but you might not have an awful lot of chance of being successful.

From personal experience of dealing with planning officers trying to foist an unpopular decision on a local community, I'd advise you to find out which elected representatives are on the planning committee and lobby them. Proposed traveller sites are often used as political footballs where one group of councillors will try and use the threat of consent for an unpopular planning app as a means of leverage when trying to get another bunch of councillors to agree to an entirely different matter. Meanwhile, the council officers (the planning officers etc) are just trying to do their jobs in a climate of total fear of the next round of redundancies so they won't do anything to upset their line manager or HoD, and they want to be able to do their job with a minimum of fuss, so the fewer objections the better as far as they're concerned.

The recent relaxation of planning laws mostly seemed to apply to house building, it might be worth you looking through the council's documentation to see if you can find any reference to designated traveller sites, there ought to be some kind of 'core strategy' or overarching document that'll show which sites have been deemed suitable. 

Whatever happens with the application, it's not decided until the planning meeting, and then there is still room for appeal. Most nimbyist objection campaigns fail, but not all.

And you know, even if you end up with a bunch of travellers opposite the pub, it might not be as bad as you fear. Some travellers are total arseholes, some travellers are perfectly fine human beings, just like the rest of the population. You got a bad bunch last time from the sound of it.


*TLDR:*

 * Councils use traveller sites as weapons in internal politicking.

 * It's always worth trying to have your say no matter what the planning officers might try and convince you.

Expect it yes; Accept it no.  That's one of the reasons for the new duties imposed on Directors in the latest Companies Act, an attempt to rein in at least British transnationals from acting in quite the single-mindedly amoral manner that such entities traditionally have.  Of course, there has been the predictable response from the British business community about government meddling making British companies less competitive in the global market place.  And there, squatting malignantly at the centre of this argument, is the fundamental problem, global corporate capitalism.

Anything any government that truly intended to shake the system by the throat and make it work for the mass of people did, which actually affected the profit margins of corporations, would be taken out on the country (capital flight, crashing of the economy, mass unemployment, disinvestment, etc.), the government (money flowing to opposition parties, bad (corporate-run) press, propaganda from ""free market"" think tanks, ultimately through to assassinations and coups - though these are usually reserved for developing world countries far from Western eyes), and the ""good"" companies (which get caned by market discipline and swallowed up by those more prepared to do evil, or simply go broke).

Of course, the vast majority of governments have no intention of making life better for the mass of people by collecting taxes assiduously from the wealthiest and the largest corporations.

As the bulk of its profits are earned overseas, it is obvious that the bulk of its taxes will be paid in those countries where it makes its profits.

Unless the Guardian is actually suggesting that Vodafone should do some dodgy deal to pay more tax in the UK and less in, for example, India or Spain?

Vodafone should only be taxed in the UK on its UK network operations, and on any Group profits that are repatriated here.

The UK subsidiary posted a net loss so wouldn't have paid tax -- which is the same situation for any company posting a net loss.

Davies era stories made more coherent sense, and usually involved The Doctor thinking his way out of situations and actually BEING A CLEVER BOY rather than just getting dumb luck and time magic thrown at him constantly (Amy remembers him so poof.) The only episode I really enjoyed with the same level of satisfaction as Davies episodes in Series 7 has been Nightmare in Silver. 

He ruined the Daleks and made them all pretty flashy colourful shiny when there was literally nothing wrong with the older Daleks. Not to mention he made them align themselves with other races during the Pandorica opens. WHEN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE EMBODIMENT OF HATE AND DEATH AND XENOPHOBIA. Remember Canary Wharf? 

Also if you think about it the Silence is really just a ripoff of Angels, which means he copied off himself.

If you look a little further, it goes a lot deeper than this.

When you combine multiple data sources, things get a little scary.

**Electoral Roll**

Consider what happens when you register to vote.
You hand over your name, current address, date of birth and other information.
Only the government have access to this data, right?

*Wrong*.

They sell this data to privately owned companies who we'll call ""The Providers"", including the ""Full"" version which is the dataset of people who have opted out of appearing on the edited version.
The edited version can be supplied to anyone, but the full version is provided to private companies who have registered as a credit reference agency. 

Do you think that means your data can only be accessed by them? Wrong again.

Any company in the UK which is simply registered with the ICO and has a data protection number can obtain this data from The Providers with a web search or API request.

This includes payday loan companies, who are not exactly a beacon of morality to begin with, banks (including overseas), financial companies, newspapers (think about this one for a moment), TV stations and other mass media, or simply a company you are applying to work for.

**Telephone Data**

BT provide a directory of all business and personal telephone numbers in a database called OSIS. It contains names, addresses and phone numbers. 

The Providers can buy this data too.

**BDM, or Birth, Death &amp; Marriage Data**

The Providers have access to this. Most of it is public information available at any register office.

Criminals looking to commit credit fraud will often assume the name and DoB of a dead person of the same age.
You can order replacement birth certificates and don't need to provide any ID.

Getting a bank account after that is fairly trivial, which is why this dataset exists.

Some, though, is only supplied to The Providers. It's called the DDRI dataset and is considered the most accurate feed of death information available. It contains fairly sensitive data.

The Providers are actually listed on the page itself:
https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-of-death-registration-information-how-to-apply

Thankfully, we don't need to fulfil any of those stringent requirements because we can just go directly to one of The Providers if we have a data protection number.

**Companies House**

Do you own a company?

It's public information, including all accounting information. If you're a director, we know how much you made last year.

**Move Home Data**

This one is a goldmine.

The Royal Mail provides a dataset which lists people that have requested mail redirection. Useful information for a stalker. Doesn't require a data protection number to access.

Some of The Providers will even scrape websites like Craigslist and Gumtree looking for evidence that your house/flat is for sale or rent:

http://www.callcredit.co.uk/products-and-services/consumer-marketing-data/home-move-triggers

Naturally, this data is enriched by our very own government who give away Land Registry house sale information to anyone:
http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/market-trend-data/public-data/price-paid-data

You can also access more detail such as the names of the buyers, if you pay for it.

Now I can roughly work out how rich you are.


**Marketing Data**

You know that checkbox at the end of that survey you once forgot to add a tick to? The one that said ""Do not pass my information on to third party companies""?

Congrats, your data has already been sold to multiple companies. Everything you entered on that form is now in the wild. If you included your mobile number on that, then enjoy the PPI text spam.

You may also be called once your contract runs out to ask about renewing, but it won't be Orange calling you - it'll be someone else.


**Mobile Phone Data**

This is perhaps the most disturbing of the lot.

Give The Providers a mobile number, and they'll tell you if it's currently switched on:

http://www.data-8.co.uk/integr8/services/mobile_validation.aspx

Combine with Twitter or Facebook location services for extra fun, which I believe allow searching for ""friends"" by mobile number.

If The News Of The World still existed, they'd love this one. Oh wait, they do: http://www.thesun.co.uk/

**In Summary**

This is only a very short look at the types of data you're giving out every day without realising it.
You could go even further and include stuff like DVLA information which is freely available to individuals looking to buy a car. This gives out the owner's current address etc.

So what happens when you combine all this stuff as well as other data like Facebook and other social media?

In short, you can build an accurate picture of what a person does day to day, what they like doing, what they buy, which movies they like, if they're pregnant, who they married, where they work. EVERYTHING. Everything a stalker, advertising company, insurance company, fraudster, criminal, or foreign government would like to know about you.

There are companies out there who will happily compile &amp; combine this data and sell it on, and some of it is available to the public via web sites as ""family tree"" type services. It's supposed to be used for fraud prevention and AML/KYC checks, and it is, but that doesn't stop you from registering a company for £30 (or whatever the fee is) with companies house and drinking from that delicious firehose yourself.

Take a quick peek at some of the fun stuff available to you or me with a simple search: http://www.123people.co.uk/s/stephen+smith

In hindsight, I probably should have just written this as a blog post and linked it here but meh, whatever.

true,chromofoam,uk,Hertfordshire,"From reading this and other similar things - their power completely goes cold as soon people stop being dependent on technology to live day-to-day.  

Can you live without your smart phone?  

If you answer ""no"" then I think you have a problem, because you obviously can, you're just psychologically attached to the idea that you need it - you don't need a smartphone, just like people 10-15 years ago didn't need one, and people 20-25 years ago didn't need a mobile phone, or an iPad, or Google, or any of these companies.  

The solution is not just one avenue - the solution is multi-faceted. The companies need to be honest (never gonna happen unless it's legislated for and policed), the government needs to be fair to citizens and not give big business tax breaks (again, never gonna happen) and the citizens need to control their spending and divert their attention away from what they're told they need, and onto what they actually truly need.  

The reality is, we don't need this technology, and while it's undeniably useful, we're not yet at a stage in society at large where our minds can reasonably handle such large amounts of data and information in a daily basis and still make balanced decisions.  

This is also reflected in music - people buy albums and releases by artists who are pushed to the front with massive funding in advertising - which is why sometimes stuff that appears to be utter crap seems to be popular. It's not there because people voted with their wallets through conscious choice, but because advertising, marketing and social mood told them that it was popular and good and the best bang for their buck.  

It's marketed to us that we need unlimited minutes, LTE comms, 3G, 4G, High speed wifi, media messaging, video calling, bigger screens, HD imagery, Facebook, News, Newspapers...I admit that in some industries and businesses, and indeed with some peoples jobs and careers, they are dependent entirely on these technologies....but when I say we don't need them...I mean we don't need them to live our lives. You won't starve or die if you remove those things from your life, even temporarily, as evidenced by the fact that people lived long and fulfilled lives before they were around.  

This is of course, only my opinion, but I believe if we really want things to change, we need to extract ourselves from this marketing frenzy and start making changes to only use what we absolutely need rather than what our friends, families, governments and social connections say that we need. Live on the minimum you require, rather than follow the pack and gain the maximum you can because it's what everyone else is doing.  

I might upset a few egos in saying this, but when I see people who have the newest smartphone, the latest home cinema, they've bought a £2000 television, they've had an iPad 1, now have an iPad 2, the old one still sitting around unused, Apple TV, Beats headphones, gadgets pouring out of every orifice I tend to think....it's your money man but jeeez...you're a mug and a half.  

Again, just my opinion but it seems silly to consume for the sake of consuming and because the media and the big companies tell you to. Go to any shop and look around and people will be making a high proportion of their purchasing choices based on what they saw on TV, in a magazine, on what the neighbours bought the other week....not based on their individual needs - the genius of it all is they think that they ARE making needs based decisions. There is an element of this that can be discounted and one cannot generalise amongst entire swathes of people, but to deny this phenomenon is ignorant at best.  

Anyway, sorry for the W.O.T but it's just my view, and I often feel quite powerless when I'm in a big UK town centre surrounded by people who seem to just be following the crowd without thinking about what they're doing.  

However...this is only my opinion. Thanks for reading.

I'm of roughly the same opinion as goob3r11, I think it's a mental thing that's doing the most harm to him and I don't think subbing for Gerrard is really going to be the way to fix that.

The Silence are a rip off of the Angels, they're a slightly similar concept in that looking at them is a key thing. But other than that they're similar in no other way, The Doctor is thinking his way out of problems, Bells of St John for instance, he thinks his way out, dumb luck doesn't save him. 

Moffat didn't ruin the Daleks, he's tried his best to make them scary again, that's a key reason why they've only been the main stars of 2 episodes, RTD era overused them to the point where you knew The Doctor would always just win, they featured in all of his series of the show and were the villains in the final episodes of series 1, 2 and 4.

Strax, Vastra and Jenny are fantastic characters, probably some of the best Moffat has created, I always love it when they show up in an episode.

River was created at the time that Moffat knew he'd be taking over, he set her up as a story-arc for when he took over control of the show, if anything Amy was shoehorned into River's story.

Also Clara is one of my favourite companions so far, she's bold and willing to trade wits with The Doctor. And you cannot start a complaint about John Hurt's Doctor, because we don't even know what his story is, Moffat has had this big plan since he started and it's nearly reaching its fruition and I'm glad that he's taking Who into bolder new directions and messing with the characters concept and history, something which RTD never really tried.

My problem with Dr.Hurt is 11 recognizes him as himself, which means he's from the past, which means they're needlessly cramming another Doctor into the timeline with no reason at all to do so.

I'd be more afraid of Daleks if they didn't resemble the apple ipod nano product line.

The Doctor was just as much a threat to the Daleks at Canary Wharf as he was at the Pandorica. “Daleks do not require the co-operation of inferior creatures!” Moffat's Daleks are totally out of character there.

Why are the 3 amigos such good characters? I don't even find them remotely interesting, Strax is slapstick comic relief, and The Silurian and her mistress are just perfect examples of the sexist overtones in basically all the women in Who since Moffat took over.

The Doctor having known River literally since her birth and being best friends with her parents just makes the fact they're lovers creepy and perverted. I thought she was going to be a genuine Time Lord, but nope, she's still just boring pointless River, coming back even after death to remind us all of how pointless she still is.

You don't mess with the concept and history of beloved characters, BAD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU DO THAT.

With regards to UK corporation tax:

* **Revenue is irrelevant.** Companies pay tax on profit, not revenue. Otherwise a shop selling a £10 item that costs £9 would have to pay £2 (20%) in tax, effectively losing £1. If you make no profit, you pay no tax.

* **Money to shareholders is irrelevant.** They didn't give out this money before paying tax. Dividends are paid to shareholders after tax. And this money came from all global operations, not the UK which made no profit.
 
* **The CEO salary is completely irrelevant**, as is the salary of any employee.

* **This ""moral"" obligation to pay more tax is bullshit.** Any person or company will pay what is legally required. I don't go to HMRC and say ""hey, here's an extra £1k on top of what I owe you"". If the tax system isn't taxing fairly, change the tax system.

* **We shouldn't tax twice**. Companies that make a profit abroad have already paid corporation tax in that country. If we started taxing them twice, the company would move its HQ to a fairer country, taking the jobs, PAYE tax and NI contributions with them.

I didn't want to challenge his assertions because firstly I too feel that there are people who should be facing prosecution regarding Libor, drug money laundering, greater accountability etc., but also because what he said was mostly vague and unverifiable. Where has he formed the idea that Operation Market Garden was deliberately bungled to extend the war and help the nazis smuggle money out of Europe? His claims regarding NATO having been formed by the SS? Outside of David Icke forums Kissinger isn't universally under threat of arrest as a war criminal, one judge in France 11 years ago stated they were interested in questioning him regarding Chile, and since then he's travelled several times to Europe. Martin Boormann simply was not smuggled out of Europe. Gosling even seems to have forgotten that Conrad Black lost control of The Telegraph to the Barclay brothers years ago. What he says is spurious and he hides behind the name of the BBC.

true,KnightDarkThe,null,null,"1) I don't see why he would leave. Luiz has been absolutely fantastic for Chelsea and has continued to improve every game. He has also shown his versatility when it comes to what position he can play (CB, DM) and we all know that's a trait Mourinho puts a lot of value into, so I don't think Mourinho has much reason to consider selling him. Not to mention it should take an exorbitant amount of money for Chelsea to even consider selling him, as they bought him for 20m pounds if I remember correctly, so there's no way he goes for less than 40m pounds I would think. And of course, Chelsea are hardly a selling club.

2) He's improved a hell of a lot. I admit I would get frustrated at his often lackadaisical defending in his first season at Chelsea, but he has really really improved. You could always tell that the potential was there with him but the way he's managed to bring out the best of himself by developing a level-headed approach to defending has truly shown the best of Luiz. The best thing about him is that the only way for him is up. He's a true fighter, and you can tell by how he plays that he has a true passion for football and for Chelsea, which is key for a football player to have.

Seems pretty crazy to me, you're not exactly loaded with CBs as it is. My guess is if anything went through the fee would be 25-30m euros.

There are no reasons why he will leave. 

1) He is loved by the fans, loved by the players. Tipped to be a captain. 

2) He loves the fans, loves the players and wants to be captain and stay with the club.

3) The rumors this year are lazy recycled rumors. Last year Barcelona actually offered him a deal and both him and Chelsea rejected them. Last year he wasn't even as good and valuable he is now and still Chelsea didn't sell him. Only lazy writers who don't have any idea what they are writing would think Chelsea would let him go now. They are also talking about last year's offer and not this year.

4) He is a very marketable player, one of our top sellers in terms of merchandise. Heck people buy his wigs and T-shirts more than most other players. Chelsea don't let their best/valuable players leave. You will find very small examples of that.

&gt;2) How do you rate him as a player? I've heard from numerous Blues that Luiz has come a long way from his reputation of being error-prone and overly offensive, but would love to hear some more details.

5) He is still improving and even now he is good enough to play for top clubs regularly. The problems he has sometimes are nothing that cant be sorted and he rarely even makes them anymore. The controlled by a kid with a PS2 stage was already exaggerated. People who still say he is more injury prone than other top defenders are basically telling you they don't watch Chelsea or only learn what they heart from pundits.

Most of his mistakes (recently) come from trying too hard. He has so much to offer at so many different positions that he wants to go help the team which lead to his mistakes. This is the kind of heart you want a player to have instead of camping defenders who sit in the box waiting for attacks. This is why Barcelona wanted him in the first place, this is the modern defender. Someone who can play like a midfielder if you ask him to and is also a solid defender. He would thrive at Barcelona hence why they wanted him because he suited them but it isn't happening.

true,slicksps,welsh,Swansea,"First off, everyone has to live somewhere, the world population is still rising. Did you know that in 196x there were 3.5 billion people on the planet, in 2011 there were 7 billion... it doubled all over in just 50ish years! These extra 3.5 billion people have to go somewhere regardless of race, background, colour or ability. This much is [fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population#Milestones_by_the_billions)

Crime rate probably will go up, every sizeable group of people has crime. Your village has existing crime before the travellers arrive, if your village was suddenly moved to Dale Farm, their crime rate would also go up. It doesn't mean that your village on the whole are criminal. I'm sure most of you are hard working individuals with a few bad apples... just like most other cultures.

When you have no say who moves into the house opposite, why do you have a right to say who moves into a field which doesn't belong to you? The UK has a fixed and finite amount of land, and a growing number of people. We need to compromise

Finally regarding social interaction; there is a clash of cultures and beliefs of course. This is unavoidable. But when one group enters another group, they will not integrate and become positive members of the community if the resistance prevents them with pre-judgement and assumptions. If the travellers are welcomed into the community with open arms, they will have no need to defend their right to exist (and vice versa of course, but being the established community, you are the hosts). Put up resistance however, or even force to try pushing them back out, and a group who want to legally exist somewhere are far less likely to integrate pleasantly.

The onus is on both parties to make this relationship work. If either party puts up a fight, the only outcome is the self-fulfilled prophesy of resentment and hatred which will help cement pre-conceived ideas about each other. The first card played in this relationship is the travellers applying to stay legally and going through all the correct procedures to show respect for the village, field and law... now it's your move. Don't use the actions of one bad apple group to judge the new and probably very different group.

tl;dr - They are human beings too with just as much right to live on the planet as any other human being. Does owning a fixed house make someone more important than another?

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"The justification for Luiz leaving given in the papers is that his playing style does not mesh with Mourinho's. On a superficial level it makes a bit of sense, but not when you think about it on a deeper level. Despite the popular media narrative, Mourinho doesn't have a concrete style; he adapts the style to the available players. So this alone does not explain why Mourinho would sell Luiz. Furthermore you would have to explain why he [tried to bring Luiz to Madrid](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1298628/Chelsea-lead-chase-David-Luiz-Jose-Mourinho-gives-up.html) and has specifically mentioned that he [looks forward to working with Luiz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25rYfSyiMY4) (starts around 5:22).

This past season Luiz has largely eliminated the errors that he is known for from previous campaigns. In a team with some talent and experience at CB, Luiz has arguably been our best. In addition, he's added the ability to play in midfield to his game. Like always Luiz divides opinion, some claiming that he's a brilliant midfielder and others saying that he's awful. As far as I can tell he's a useful option against lesser teams, but has trouble against better ones (though there's no reason he can't improve his play in that position with some experience). 

Luiz is a cult hero for the fans. It's true that he still is too offensive to be a traditional CB, but the benefits outweigh the costs. With the right defensive partner (like an in-form Terry), Luiz is a great option for playing out from the back. He is an immensely talented footballer, and makes watching the game fun. He's a leader on the field, and has adopted the history and culture of the club. No fans I know want to lose him.

In the same fashion: Ballack had *a shot* of representing his country on the biggest stage. Boateng fucked that up. Cechmate can distance himself from any notion of fan culture if he wants, I'm opposed to the transfer. Not one of those links that he posted up forced a retirement from international football just weeks away from a WC. 

Sorry if it was ambiguous, and both of those interpretatiosn could have been inferred. Given the context, and hopefully you didn't need to google that Ballack played for fucking Germany, it was pretty clear what was meant.

The first thing I remember from History in infant school involved the rhyme:

*In fourteen hundred and ninety-two*
*Columbus sailed the ocean blue*

and then some stuff about Native Americans which involved building little teepees and colouring paper feathers to put in paper headresses.

In year 3 (age 7) we moved on to more proper history. First the Vikings and Anglo-Saxons. Gory stuff, very interesting for little kids!

Year 4 we did the Tudors. Quite an important and interesting part of English history. I think almost everybody gets this one at some point.

Year 5 we had several topics. One was World War II. Very big deal obviously. We mostly learnt about the home front during the period. Then to follow up we also learnt about Britain during the 50s and 60s. It being the 90s at the time this enabled us to speak to our parents, older teachers etc about the time period and get a living sense of history. I guess actually we didn't focus solely on Britain because we also learnt about the space race and some other technological stuff. No mention of the Cold War or anything like that.

Also in year 5 we did the Ancient Greeks.

In year 6 our two topics were the Ancient Egyptians and the Victorians. I really enjoyed both of those.

After this secondary school starts so the study of history changes a little bit at that time. In primary school your history topic would connect in to your other subjects. For example in Maths while studying the Victorians we learnt how to add old money (pounds, shillings and pence.) In Art while studying the Greeks we made Greek vases. This didn't happen any more in secondary school.

Consequently although it was more recent I actually have slightly less recall of my history studies in secondary school because it wasn't so involved.

In year 7 we did the Romans. In year 8 we did the Battle of Hastings and the Middle Ages (mostly village life). In year 9 we did a whole load on the causes of World War I and then very little on the actual war.

I then ceased to do history at age 14 because the GCSE course offered at my school covered ONLY ""Government in Europe 1918 to 1939."" Just that one topic for two years. I elected to do Religious Studies instead because that actually managed to be more interesting.",0,1370705816,null,0,false,0,caeqmdq,t3_1fw7zr,t1_caeqmdq,t3_1fw7zr,null,1430881936,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

&gt;(d)the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment,
&gt;(e)the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct,

There are others but these are the more relevant ones.

Whenever something bad happens, the powers that be look to an easy scapegoat, and more often than not these days, that’s the internet.

After the horrific murder of Lee Rigby, Home Secretary Theresa May and others called for the return of the so-called Snoopers Charter, though as of yet there’s no evidence to suggest that seeing the sender and recipient of every email sent by Britons — but not the content — would have prevented that poor man’s death.

Today, after the sentencing of Mark Bridger for murdering five-year-old April Jones, it’s happening again. This time, politicians and lobbyists are calling for some combination of porn, violent porn, and child porn to be stripped from Google or otherwise blocked from the web.

There’s a lot of misinformation on this emotive subject — not least because many images of child sexual abuse are already stripped from Google and blocked from the web.

In case you — like the major newspapers in this country — aren’t aware, there’s a body in the UK called the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF works with ISPs and web giants (ie, Google, one of its funders), getting child abuse content taken down and blocked — you may remember it once had Wikipedia blocked over an image of a naked girl on a Scorpion’s album cover.

Legality

As a ""self-appointed, self-regulated internet watchdog, which views user-submitted content and compiles a list of websites that it deems to contain illegal images"" there have been questions raised regarding the legality of their viewing content that would normally constitute a criminal offence.[33]

If you have a bit of money and want a special meal, the Drunken Duck is a pub in the Lake District that happens to serve some of the finest food in Britain. It's very expensive but it's worth the money.

http://drunkenduckinn.co.uk/

I really like the pub at Wasdale Head - it's at the wrong end of the lake from Wasdale Hall but it's an easy stroll, even drunk on Old Peculier.

While in Wasdale, if the weather's too grim for a ""real"" hill, Yewbarrow has it's charms.

Windermere to Ambleside is fun by the ferry. Fairly cheap.

Keswick is a very good place for shopping. After a few days on the fells I'm always glad to see a Waitrose.

In the lowland woods between Windermere and Coniston, take the time to sit down quietly for half an hour and you'll likely see some red squirrels, which are now quite a rare sight in the UK.

As for scams, get out of London and the big cities and you'll probably be fine. On London transport a common scam is a distraction theft/melon drop - one person nudges you into another who is carrying something which they then drop - perhaps a bottle of wine, a cup of tea, whatever. They then start complaining, hoping you'll give them some money for the worthless item they've dropped. Meanwhile someone else is going through your pockets and bags.

In the cause of their benefactors, *the shareholders*, not in good faith in the cause of the general public.

So whilst a company may produce a net benefit society, they have no responsibility to. You might as well ask elephants not to sharpen their tusks on tree bark causing massive damage to the three.

Efficiency in business is *absolutely* about ""make money, fuck everything else"". If they discovered that they could make more money by stopping selling life saving pharmaceuticals and selling red balloons instead, they'd be insane not to do it, despite the fact that it would cost potentially millions of lives. *That's what business is*. If you want to effect change, hit the business where it hurts - in the wallet, e.g. fines for environmental damage - but expect businesses to act exactly how businesses do - by performing a cost benefit analysis and deciding whether to do it anyway.

Stop trying to make business what you think it should be, rather than what it is. All that business is, is a scaling up of the very simple concept of trade between two people. If I were a superhero who could cure all disease, according to business logic I would have exactly *zero* requirement to do so, just because I have the capability to.

true,dwair,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"The point I’m making is that a strategy of snooping on the general public can’t be aimed at either improving national security or stopping crime – if you are involved with either to any degree you will obfusticate your involvement whist using either the web or telecoms to such an extent it makes a mockery of recording your data.  This is not rocket science and your going have to be a pretty dumb terrorist who has lived in a cave for 20 years not to use these techniques. The only reason I can see governments would want to do this is to control organised dissent.  Would the Arab spring gained so much momentum so quickly if the governments in question had access to all that our government apparently has?  

As far as false positives go and feeling creeped out that I’m being electronically watched – Yup I feel a little creeped out and have just cause to be a bit paranoid.  Since 2001 I have been “interviewed informally” twice now by twats in suits because I came to “their” attention.  I don’t even know who “they” are.  I have spent a lot of time travelling to what some people regard as slightly iffy parts of the world (Algeria, Afghanistan, Libya, Mail, Mauritania, Niger, Pakistan, Oman, Yemen etc) as I was both a climber and explorer.  I also have a professional interest in computer based security so dabble a bit in online with this kind of thing.  All in all this is really not a very healthy combination.  I know I’m on various lists.  Luckily I’m very white and despite having some weird contacts in dubious places I’m not exactly a threat to anyone.  I also don’t really give a shit apart from realising my visa applications take a week longer than everyone else’s. Consequently I happily spend my time creating jobs for computer science graduates by using near military grade encryption to send my friends all over the world cute pictures of cats. 

If your reading this guys (because I didn’t bother with tor today for the lol’s ) I hope you enjoyed the picture of the pug in a birthday hat I sent khamel last week and hope they let you out of the cubicle soon to enjoy this nice weather XXX

Government's role is to take the winnings from the game, and distribute them among the people that didn't get enough cards so that they can continue to be part of the game (if you don't play the game, you die, btw).   

It's the government, who is elected by the people, to represent the people, who has to take care of the people.  If the government isn't doing this, then we need a new fucking government.  And if none of them want to do it, then we need a new game.  Perhaps one that involves sharing and co-operation instead of trying to fuck everyone over at every opportunity.

Sorry, I got carried away.  The 'welfare of the people' is only interesting in that the people do the jobs that make the rich richer.  But if they're not needed, then fuck 'em.  They can all starve.

This is what capitalism is - a negotiation between two parties who both have value to trade, nothing more. You may choose to give your value away for free (we call it charity) but expecting other people to is utterly naive, in my opinion.

Being a war-born veteran, 9 has that adorable lighthearted approach to anything and everything because no horror will ever compare to the endless war into which he was born, and the genocide he committed. For this same reason, he values life to an extremely reckless degree, and refuses to take any harmful or destructive action toward anyone but a dalek. His reaction to seeing the first dalek after the war gives me shivers every time.

10 is beginning to let go of his survivor guilt, and starting to understand that the laws of time travel can be broken. He slowly stops seeing himself as the lonely, last timelord, and begins to see himself as The Timelord, to create his own laws and guidelines as the sole representative of his race (as best shown in The Waters Of Mars.) His stance on weapons and violence has changed significantly as well.

11 is the most innocent and juvenile of them in part because he's finally come to terms with his role in the war and in part because he's trying to move past his recent mistakes , through this new beginning. One could argue that his innocence is also a result of meeting a child while he was still regenerating, absorbing some of her youthful mentality. Regardless, this more childish personality is displayed in a number of ways, first to mind being the Dinosaurs On A Spaceship episode when he left Solomon to die after he killed the triceratops.

They are all uniquely wonderful, and I've never been able to choose a favorite. This next doctor will be a hard sell for two episodes, as usual, but I'm sure I'll love him in his own way soon enough.

c) the relationships maintained between the company and supplier / customer rise and fall by the behaviour between them, but any additional value afforded them outside of the contract is purely incidental. I've once heard business described as ""two people signing a contract, then trying to piss on each other without getting the contract wet"".

d) May mention the impact on the community and environment, but that only implies the *direct* negative impact, as opposed to the passive negative impact or the lack of positive impact.

For example, we might punish a car company if they do not meet european legislation concerning emissions, however the overall fact that car companies benefit from selling more cars but we all suffer from too many cars being on the road is not taken into consideration - car companies are in business to sell as many cars as possible, so congested roads (wasted time of people) and pollution are a passive negative and the company is under no obligation to fix this unless government steps in.

We also don't mention the fact that no-one steps in to perform actions that benefit society despite not having any profit - it is well known that governments seem to somehow be keen to sell off profitable parts of its services to the private sector, but this seems to show corruption within the system, whereas no-one wants to be burdened with the cost of an unprofitable service except where the government steps in and makes it profitable by giving handouts to companies to perform said services.

e) Most companies would put this under PR - a bad advert is just as likely to damage a companies' reputation, not to mention the fact that it is very difficult to know exactly what is going on in a company except where a court order publically discloses wrongdoing.

Of course the point you're actually making is defending is boring. Well scary, and sometimes boring. But at the highest level defending is important and against lower teams possession is important because they tend to take their chances (opta stats regularly show bottom placed teams having the best clear cut chance conversion rates).

To say that Chelsea would just automatically become a defensive side is foolish. Particularly when defensive midfield is our weakest area. And as bayern are showing the world. Having a cohesive team capable of playing in multiple ways is considerably more effective than having a particularly set philosophy.

Equally the English premier league regularly shows the ability of lower teams to step it up against more revered opponents and to not be ready defensively would be foolish again. Jose is probably one of the best tactically adept managers in the world. Admittedly I would prefer him to incorporate a more game by game tactical approach but he favours a more statistical approach in the sense that he sets his season's preferred formation and tactical duties to that which he thinks will achieve the most points with his squad. In this case, you could argue that because the EPL is considerably less goal adverse than when he left his approach may well change to reflect that.

Ramires works well but is prone to mistakes and makes up for his defensive mistakes with hard work and sheer pace. 

Mikel is Mr. Inconsistant, provides very little in distribution and has been a problem this year. I personally think that he is the reason we often loose pace to our attacks and they fizzle out.

Romeu / Chalobah / Essien will be squad players or loaned out, i think Romeu an Essien will stay and Chalobah will go back to Watford. 

De Rossi with Ramires next to him would work well because Ramires can play the pivot and De Rossi will be the distributor. If we go in for Boateng instead he would play in the Pivot alongside i think Luiz. Another option would be Witsel from Zenit, he can play both roles in midfield but i think he would be amazing next to Boateng as the power we would then have in midfield could be immense.

What the hell, when did this team become Torres FC who give a fuck if Torres cannot compete for a starting spot. the last 3 years he's been playing without proving anything or why he should even starts. To be the best we need players to fight for their position and get the best out of each other not buckle down and go mental oonce someone better than you challenge you for the starting spot. I'll say it now if we dont buy a quality striker before september there is no god damn way on earth we will win the Premier League or Champions League. Torres below par performance cannot do anything for us in those competition. He played 36 games last year in the BPL started 28 and came on as sub in 8 and score 8 goals, Champions league he started 5 and sub in for one scoring 3 goals, one was a own goal and the other two was against Nordsjaelland. we cannot win trophies with those stats. and all those talking about he scored 22 goals this season and that it more than Rooney, Tevez and blah blah blah, dont forget to know he play 20+ more games in 7 different competition more than anyone of those other players and only scored 22 goals 75 percent of them coming against lesser opposition. I'm so sick and tire of people backing Torres for contributing nothing to the team but criticizing players like Ramires, Mikel, Cahill, Iva, Moses, and Bertrand whenever they make mistakes. This is not Torres FC this is **CHELSEA FC**. if you want all your Torres circlejerk go over to /r/FernandoTorresIsGOD

However, if we do apply the laws of evolution properly here, it does make some sense what blacks would have evolved to survive in hot conditions (hence why they are black) and would have evolved to be better at running and throwing, as it would have been harder to find food and thus only the *very* strongest in the early African tribes would have survived, therefore natural selection occurs. Not only this, but there is further evidence that blacks would have been more likely to have evolved/adapted further along the lines of warfare/aggression due to the fact that their areas of the world have tended to be more war torn than the 'white' areas (i.e. Northern Europe) which could have led to enlargement of the brain in some areas and a shrinking in others. Furthermore, there's the whole question of neanderthals (stupid as shit) mating with other homo species in Africa which may not have happened in Europe, although honestly I've got nowhere near enough knowledge in that area to say much more.

I don't think that blacks or whites are superior or inferior to one-another, we're all human.

true,MrBushido2318,eu,European Union,"If anybody is struggling to quit, I'd recommend an e-cig. I tried nicotine inhalers and patches in the past but I've been smoking so long that my biggest weakness was that I had nothing to do with my hands (10+ years of rolling a smoke every 30-60 minutes).

Anyway, I did a little research on /r/electronic_cigarette and it's been a month since my last tobacco product! Ignoring the initial cost (around £30), I've only used a half of a bottle of nicotine liquid which cost around £8. I'd have smoked around four 50g pouches of golden virginia in the same period of time, so my habbit has gone from costing me £60/mo to £4/mo.

~~The great thing is that you can easily water down the nicotine liquid to help ween yourself off too. And even if you don't manage to quit completely, you're only smoking water vapour with diluted medical grade nicotine and a bit of flavouring. Which is undoubtedly far safer than all the nasty tar and chemicals found in tobacco smoke.~~

I absolutely agree with you that it is because of lack of government oversight that the internet has turned into the wonder that it is.  That is, in fact, exactly what I said in my last comment.  Here is, for example, one of the sentences I wrote:
&gt; And, very importantly, it has managed to do so without any government interference at all.

Since we are agreeing with each other, I therefore don't know why you would think that political battles could possibly do any good, when we have such fabulous tools at our disposal that are ten times more effective.  Don't you see you'd be fighting it on their grounds and on their terms?  

The greatness of the internet is that we have finally managed to get away from the established systems and run our own, much more efficient system, and Pandora was out of the box before they could do anything about it.  By the time they caught onto this, it was already too late.  

The technology is what liberated us, so let's keep using the technology to liberate us further.

Think about it in metaphorical terms.  Let's say you're being persecuted by a big boxer who wants to hit you.  Now, your cleverness and swiftness have allowed you to be free from the man and do very well.  Why, at this point, would you suddenly want to stand still and play the game on his terms?  Keep running!  Keep developing better tools for yourself so that there is physically nothing the guy can do about it!

You say the democratic way is easier than for the average citizen to learn how to encrypt everything.  But you're seeing this as a zero-sum game.  The tools to encrypt are today as easy to use as sending an email itself.  I'll give you an example.  Tor used to be something you had to install as an add-on to your browser and then activate everytime you wanted to browse in the onion.  Not anymore.  Tor now has its own browser that you just open exactly the same way you'd open IE or Firefox.  PGP used to be something you had to set up as an add-on to your email client and then figure out what a public key was and what the difference was with a private key.  Not anymore.  Email applications already exist with PGP installed, and setting up your keys is literally just pressing a button...

Now, don't get me wrong.  Parliamentary democracy is a lovely thing.  But it is not the final step.  It's just a stepping stone to much more advanced human interaction systems.  Once you start using your imagination thinking about what the next possible steps might be, you'll quickly realise the bluntness of the tools you currently have at hand.

Faith should be no basis on getting a good education, but that is the situation we find ourselves in. Surely we should be demanding change in non-faith schools so this is not an issue?

I just cannot help but assume that removing the faith requirement would just bring the school down to the same level as the schools around. 

This is all from my experience of both types of school, so it is completely subjective but I think one of the major reasons these schools succeed is because they retain an identity and a traditional level of discipline. There doesn't necessarily have to be religion for this to happen, but it helped foster a sense of unity within the school.

If that sense of oneness or unity (faith in this case) is removed, we end up with a school like my secondary. It was very multicultural but nobody really mixed races now I think of it (except the grungers). Teachers were disconnected, stressed and resentful, as were students. The whole thing felt like a social club rather then a school and nobody cared about anything really.

true,gmfthelp,eng-eastsusex,Engurlund,"&gt; It can be argued that preventing lobbying is a violation of a person/entities rights to donate money to their favorite politicians. This is why it was ruled unconstitutional to remove it in America, and would now need a constitutional amendment instead.

Are you speaking on behalf of the US or the UK? Cameron promised a crackdown on lobbying (to forbid financial relations between lobbyists and Parliamentarians) and has done fuck all about it. 

Two years ago http://goo.gl/K635c

The sneaky thing that Cameron is now  trying to do is to drag the unions into this http://goo.gl/gBsxb

To compare Us's lobbying to UK's lobbying is pointless, in my opinion. The US is a corporation, the UK is not (not yet, anyway). We go about things very different to you. Everything is for sale in the US, it's harder to buy your way in the UK (but of course it still happens)

The US's idea of capitailsm (pure) is very different to UK's/Europe's (social).
