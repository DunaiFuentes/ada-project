true,martodve,1972crest,,"The ones leaving are clearly Lescott, Sinclair and Dzeko. The ones who may be leaving are Garcia, Nasri and Tevez. These are my thoughts about what our plans might be:     
If a defender leaves (Lescott), we should get someone experienced, about 26-27, he should be able to replace Kompany or Nastasic any day. But if Mancini decides to snub Nastasic and go for another man, he'll probably go for Hummels, Chiellini or Bonucci.           
If a midfielder leaves (Garcia, Nasri), we should get Fellaini. Him and Yaya would cause terror in midfield. He would be one of the best possible signing we could make.     
If a striker leaves (Tevez, Dzeko), we should get Cavani or Falcao (we all know that). Falcao has quite a nice record against PL teams and plays like a mixture of Tevez and Dzeko - fast, agile, clinical and incredible in the air. Cavani on the other hand plays like Yaya (different roles I know) - he goes back and help the defense, ignites counterattacks and shoots every time he has a chance, but he's not very consistent (kind of like Dzeko - incredible when on form, horrible when out of it). If we don't manage Falcao or Cavani, we should go for Higuain or Gomez.       
If Milner leaves (I really hope not, but rumors and all that), we should go for Navas. He said he is ready for a step forward the other day. He impressed me with his play with Silva at the Euros and I'd really love to see that more.

There's also one each with the first two doctors on there that I haven't watched yet, and I think two more 4th Doctor stories. My thoughts are a bit mixed.  
It took a couple of tries to watch at first because the special effects were just so terrible coming from the modern series, but I was able to get past that.

I really don't see what makes Tom Baker so special. He's not bad, just doesn't live up to the hype.

true,raorao,null,null,"I'd suggest a one-off episode that's light on the season-arc stuff. As for which episodes in particular, it really depends on what your friends like: 

If they are not particularly sci-fi-ish, *Vincent and the Doctor* is a good place to start. There will be a few lines of dialogue that don't make any sense, but its a great thematic starting point for the series (as in, it's a show that packs more of an emotional punch than any other sci-fi program). Another good one would be *A Christmas Carol*, although its somewhat of a time commitment. 

If they would prefer something even lighter, either of the Craig episodes would work. *The Eleventh Hour* would be a solid choice as well -- the real set piece of that episode is the adorable interaction between young Amy and the Doctor. 

If they are sci-fi nerds, something darker might be better. *The Beast Below* would be a good introduction to the hard sic-fi aspects of Who. *Dalek* and *The Waters of Mars* would work as well. 

If they are horror fans, I'd suggest *The Girl in the Fireplace*, *Midnight*, or the *The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances* two-parter. Blink is arguably scarier than all of those episodes, but isn't a great entry point to the series, since it doesn't feature the Doctor prominently. *The God Complex* has some of the best hallway-running of the series as well. Hell, even *Hide* is a pretty good horror episode.

The problem with that is that this issue has been going on for over a decade now.

Either the farmers are happy to lose money year after year and can afford to keep doing so without somehow going bust.

Or they have something else going on that is supporting their income, and for some odd reason insist on still producing milk despite the losses.

...or milk production isn't actually a loss making industry as is being claimed. For example, what about the secondary sales of meat from the cows and calves? How is that factored in. What about EU subsidies?

It defies belief frankly that farmers can apparently continue for a decade or so running at a loss and not go bust. No other industry could manage it - so how do farmers do it?

There are/were quarterly updates available, but not every company buys that.

So, if you are not listed yet, then realistically it's down to the online website manager not buying the updates.

Then your best bet would be to contact the local council planning offices and check that the address is registered with them, explain the problem and see if they will ping an update over to the Post Office for you.

To be honest this makes me really angry. I would love to have another child but, at present, we simply cannot afford it. So, we won't have one until such time as we can. Rather than rely on benefits to bail us out we will wait until my job situation, and income, improves. Why therefore should your family come to the UK and hope for the government to bail you out? What right have you got when you have never paid anything into the system? I am sorry for your plight (and I appreciate that it was your parents' decision and not yours to move countries) but you and your family are the public face of everything that is wrong with the unregulated immigration policy of the UK.

You will notice from my profile by the way that, although British, I live in HK.

It really depends what you're into... if you like nature then Wicken Fen is worth a visit, typical Fenland wetlands just outside Cambridge.

If you like history the American Military Cemetary at Madingley is sobering, and Duxford Air Museum which has lots of aviation and warfare history and often has good airshows.

If you like old houses there's Wimpole Hall, Audley End and Anglesea Abbey, they often have concerts in the summer.  Lots of the colleges in Cambridge host outdoor theatre performances too.

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"The in-laws live in Bury St. Edmunds, so I know it quite well.  It's a pretty little town, but there's not an awful lot going on there - it's one of those places where seemingly every pub is a chain pub and every restaurant is a chain restaurant, there's not an awful lot of local character.  It does have some wonderful old buildings though, the cathedral is splendid and it's definitely worth taking a turn round the abbey gardens to see the ruins of the old abbey.

Having said that, if you fancy standing in uncomfortable proximity with your fellow drinkers, you could try the [smallest pub in Britain](http://www.thenutshellpub.co.uk/), which I can't say I've been in myself, but always looks quite friendly from the outside.  Bury also benefits from having a Picturehouse 'independent' cinema which has just opened a new cafe/bar, but like most things in Bury St Edmunds it feels a bit middle aged.

Cambridge is probably a stronger bet for things of genuine cultural interest, I don't know it so well but with the student population there are likely to be more interesting little bars, restaurants and shops than there are in Bury.  I highly recommend the Fitzwilliam museum if you're into history, for me it's second only to the British Museum in the amount of splendid things it contains - it has some pretty great paintings as well.  Even if the museum isn't your thing, its always worth having a wander around the sleepy colleges and backstreets of a city with as much history and culture as Cambridge.  From experience, it's about 20 minutes on the train from Bury, but I don't know if they run late enough that you could have a proper night of it and still make the last one back.

Finally (and least usefully if you haven't got a vehicle), Bury is not *too* far away from the Suffolk coast between Southwold and Aldeburgh.

- Taxi drivers. Fair enough, I guess. They want to get their fayre to their destination quickly. 
- Bus and lorry drivers. I suppose they realise that if they slow down behind me then they will take much longer to build up speed on the bendy roads around here. So they take their chances to overtake while still in momentum - making for a scary few corners. 
- Anyone coming out of the golf club. Apparently that junction has unwritten, special dispensation for pulling out into the middle of traffic. 

But... honestly, the guys in white vans (there are probably about 10-20 on any given day) always give lots of time and consideration and I've never had one cut me off or try overtaking before a straight.

Right, and I think that this is a huge problem. I'd hate to see the UK become completely culturally homogeneous, but at the same time a degree of integration is needed, and it's not going to happen when the only media attention Muslims get is vicious attacks a la the Telegraph on one side, and then on the flip side the Guardian are trying to wrap them in cotton wool and stop everyone from saying anything critical of them.

The club that they support release a guide for new 'fans' on how to act like a proper City supporter, this is just comedic gold! 

&gt;If asked where we play our football, it's the City of Manchester Stadium""

I mean seriously? HAHA that's gold!

**Some More:** 
&gt;It is ""a guide to help 'newbies' bluff your way through the televised games"". It explains how to celebrate goals with the 'Poznan' dance, the meaning of Blue Moon, the club's anthem, and other pointers such as ""this is our first FA Cup final since 1981, so don't try to bluff your way through historical facts. The last trophy we won was in 1976 so, again, get this right or you'll arouse suspicion.""
&gt;
&gt;The guide advises: ""If you are asked who your favourite players are from down the years – your credibility is at stake here – don't say Francis Bell, Colin Summerbee and Yaya Dzeko. Though these names exist, they are combinations. Have a good scan over the club website and check out who the current favourites are and who the club legends are, and take notes!""

well this is exactly my point; good comedians like Stone and Parker go and look for jokes in the source material (the book of mormon). Your audience doesn't need to know jack-all about mormons to find it funny; so I find O'Briain's defence somewhat wanting. What he's really saying is 'I can't be bothered, I don't want to' - which is perfectly fine too. (or more likely 'I don't want to die').

again, as above, this doesn't wash when you look at book of mormon. It's already a big hit in London - how many of those are mormons or familiar with mormonism? the humour in it has been described as anything but cheap. evidently we don't need education to lay the ground work for some full on mockery/comedy at the expense of religious groups.

I'm not in support of a St George's day Holiday, I'm in support of extra holidays for several other reasons:

* Automation will get to the point where there will be less jobs, in a growing population this effect could be huge.
* There is already high unemployment, reducing the total hours people work creates need for extra jobs.
* The extra holiday time gives people a chance to improve their skill sets, learn a language or even just get their life in order. Perhaps they could even have time to set up their own business.
* More time to exercise or play sport improving the health of the country (admittedly people might drink more but i believe this is a product of the working week causing anxiety issues and depression)
* People would have more time to create art or works of cultural significance
* Volunteering work could increase allowing charities to provide more support to people in need.
* People would spend more money in the leisure and tourist industry, *creating* jobs. As an example, It could see a rejuvenation of seaside towns.

&gt;Four Lions
http://www.imdb.co.uk/title/tt1341167/
&gt;Four incompetent British jihadists set out to train for and commit an act of terror.

&gt;Director: Christopher Morris

&gt;Writers: Christopher Morris, Sam Bain,

It's a comedy about muslim terrorists, written by someone who is not a muslim. However, the main writer Chris Morris did such a good job of portraying what it feels like to be a muslim, that the real terrorists arrested recently, joked about being ""the four lions, just one man short"".

http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4604000/Were-the-Four-Lions-just-one-man-short.html

And I haven't seen the book of mormon, however, I have seen the relevant south park episode. What came across in that was not just ""dumb de dumb dumb dumb"", but also how unrelentingly nice mormons are, and what it felt like as kid to spend time with them.

This is what I think is important in good satire, that it's recognisable and understandable to the people on the inside, and this is exactly what mormons are saying about the ""book of mormon"", that they can to some degree identify with the caricatures of themselves.

Edit: Finally, the book of mormon has traded heavily on the success of south-park to be such a success. This is probably why many people aren't familiar with comedy films about muslim terrorists, but do know about the book of mormon.",0,1366715023,null,0,false,0,c9kvg9j,t3_1cx6rb,t1_c9kvg9j,t1_c9kv3qs,null,1431459300,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Depends, is the office building providing a necessary public service?

&gt;Whether you personally can or not is down to the individual, but the blunt point is that farming is a business, and often a very aggressive one, and no business can carry on operating at a loss without either going bust or seeking alternative options.

It is a business but it's also a vital part of human life. The health industry is a business but I'm pretty sure the NHS would be making a loss if it was a standalone. 

&gt;But all this is a distraction - we still don't know how apparently loss making dairy farms haven't all gone bust. Something doesn't add up in the reports.

Subsidies. 

You still haven't explained how to change a dairy farm into an arable farm in 3 easy steps yet.

What the bloody hell has that got to do with it?

&gt; It is a business but it's also a vital part of human life. The health industry is a business but I'm pretty sure the NHS would be making a loss if it was a standalone. 

That the UK consumes food is obvious, but that doesn't mean that farm x is vital to that, or indeed that the milk industry as a whole is vital to it. We could easily import food -- and the UK has almost always been a net importer -- so the closure of a few loss making dairy farms would have no measurable impact on society.

&gt; Subsidies

So as a business, they aren't actually losing money - they are making a net profit, but want to rebalance where the profits come from. So they should stop lying about their claims that selling milk is a loss making enterprise. It isn't.

&gt; You still haven't explained how to change a dairy farm into an arable farm in 3 easy steps yet.

I have never said it would be ""3 easy steps"" and gone out of my way to point out that it wouldn't be ""3 easy steps"".

You're the only one here demanding that it be available in ""3 easy steps"". I conclude from your insistence on that then that farmers are too lazy to save their business if doing so involved ""4 difficult steps""?

Well this is business, no-one gives you shit out of the goodness of their heart. If you want something you go out there and you make it happen. You take, no-one gives.

&gt;I don't have an issue with governments subsidising food at all, it's incredibly common throughout the world and surely keeping essentials cheap at the point of purchase is the duty of a government.

I don't see why. Adding bureaucracy onto the whole process means an overall increased spending compared with just simply having lower taxes.

&gt;I disagree, non-violent direct action has certainly brought attention to the issue.

Tbh I still debate (as in, I'm unsure of my position on the issue) whether blockading is non-violent. I mean, if you find a person sleeping on the street and you build a cell around them before they wake up - that might not be direct physical violence, but it's certainly impacting upon their freedoms and so is wrong, as are blockades, regardless of whether they're considered a form of violence or not.

Reasonably priced food is a human right.

&gt;That the UK consumes food is obvious, but that doesn't mean that farm x is vital to that, or indeed that the milk industry as a whole is vital to it. We could easily import food -- and the UK has almost always been a net importer -- so the closure of a few loss making dairy farms would have no measurable impact on society.

Food should not be subject to market forces such as the price of oil, food is increasing in price and so is transport, it would have an impact on society if people have to pay more for essential foods. Milk goes off very quickly, it's not exactly cheap and easy to import to a small island. Also, this is not ""a few loss making farms"", it's a large number of farmers. Do you really think that the supermarkets are going to suddenly start paying more if a few farms close? 

&gt;I have never said it would be ""3 easy steps"" and gone out of my way to point out that it wouldn't be ""3 easy steps"".

&gt;You're the only one here demanding that it be available in ""3 easy steps"". I conclude from your insistence on that then that farmers are too lazy to save their business if doing so involved ""4 difficult steps""?

Cool - and if we can import milk for less than producing it locally, lets close the local farms and import it instead.

The fact that milk is, by your own admission subsidised by the taxpayer, and farmers want to put the price up, means that by your own argument, you are calling for more expensive food. Which would breach those human rights you talk about.

&gt; Food should not be subject to market forces

It has been ever since mankind started trading in food - why should that stop all of a sudden?

&gt; Also, this is not ""a few loss making farms"", it's a large number of farmers. Do you really think that the supermarkets are going to suddenly start paying more if a few farms close? 

Like all market forces, if there is a shortage of supply to demand, then prices will rise. It is in the farmers own best interests for that to happen.

Of course, that pushes up retail prices -- which you presumably object to because of the human rights implications.

&gt; My apologies, just explain how it's done in whatever format you think best.

As in any business, identify loss making areas, and costs of closing down those divisions in favour of diverting resources into profitable ones.

Nope, I'd like the supermarkets to pay a fair price to the farmers, that would raise the price of milk in the supermarket by only a few pence. If that requires a subsequent penny or so increase in benefit/minimum wage because farmers no longer require so much subsidy then I'm satisfied. 

&gt;It has been ever since mankind started trading in food - why should that stop all of a sudden?

It hasn't though, has it? Let me cite a few examples:

* Rationing
* Taxation of unhealthy food
* Almost all counties have subsidies on different foods.

There many more which I can't remember off the top of my head. 

&gt;Like all market forces, if there is a shortage of supply to demand, then prices will rise. It is in the farmers own best interests for that to happen.

Not the farmer in a traditional sense but agribusiness, yes. I have no economic reason for being against agribusiness, more cultural reasons. Although there would be the issue of paying benefits for unemployed farmers because the massive industrial farms don't employ many people. That would only be an issue for a generation or so I suppose but the loss of the local farming infrastructure will become an issue in my opinion once the price of oil becomes an economic issue for large centralised dairies.",0,1366718797,null,0,false,0,c9kw0re,t3_1cx74z,t1_c9kw0re,t1_c9kvqtd,null,1431459032,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We **were** winning in regular play. We scored first with Oscar's header from nowhere then again with a rightfully-awarded penalty. The score was 2-1. The score was still 2-1 despite some terrible non-calls from the referee(s).

Suarez biting Ivanovic obviously did not bring an advantage to Liverpool, nor would it have with a competent referee. He bit Ivanovic to bait the referee into thinking Ivanovic fouled him in the box. Luckily for Liverpool, the referee saw neither the actual bite nor the ensuing tangle between Ivanovic and Suarez, which if having missed the actual bite could have looked a lot like Ivanovic just shoving Suarez to the ground. Unluckily for us, the referee didn't see the action/reaction either -- thus no card for Suarez.

To be honest, calls get missed all the time. I'm more upset at the ludicrous amount of stoppage time given. If anything, we were robbed of winning via ridiculous stoppage time allotment.

My point is that people **are** actively calling for the deportation of Muslims; not just Arabs.

&gt;did you see the panorama on this last night? I would say I agree with them.

Nnngg... I agree it's a serious issue, but there's definitely a lot of fearmongering about how widespread it is. Obviously a situation like Tower Hamlets is completely unacceptable, but the vast, vast majority of British Muslims are content to live under UK law.

&gt;a joke about child abuse being worn out is not helping your case; it just shows how christians tolerate it instead of going on a rampage. christians (and churches) have suffered because of that association (and its being repeated in jokes across all denominations).

Apparently they don't tolerate it - they complain to Ofcom. 

&gt;sorry, can't help but disagree. there are many christian-centric jokes which are full of malice; just look at Boyle or Gervais or Dawkins. A throwaway muslim joke doesn't make anyone hate muslims anymore than a throwaway christian joke makes anyone hate christians. the logic you're using is a kind of slur on the general public; that they are simpletons who hear a joke and become racists.

Frankie Boyle doesn't have any real malice behind anything he says - it's all about getting reactions (and he's made some pretty scathing jokes about Islam in his time). Ricky Gervais...there's no accounting for him, really. I think he just seems like an unpleasant wee guy. Dawkins isn't a comedian, and is just as critical of Islam as he is of Christianity.

&gt;the logic you're using is a kind of slur on the general public; that they are simpletons who hear a joke and become racists.

Try to find a paper round. You won't get a lot of money but every little helps and it's only about an hours worth of work a day in the morning so you can still take care of your little sister. Also, maybe you can find some work as a translator? Not necessarily translating in person but translating documents on the computer so you can do it in your own time. Lived with a Slovakian girl who helped translate a book over email and she did it while watching TV. As you won't have credentials you won't get much but it might be worth a look. 

Your mum should consider getting a job in an established hairdressing salon as the money would be more steady and once she has some regular customers set up her own place and take those customers with her. Or if she wants to stay as her own boss and assuming she has her own transport she should look into being a mobile hairdresser who goes to people's own homes to do their hair - useful for the elderly, sick people with reduced mobility, mothers with young children who can't leave the house etc. ",0,1366721069,null,0,false,0,c9kwgpw,t3_1cvyje,t1_c9kwgpw,t3_1cvyje,null,1431458824,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; My point is that people are actively calling for the deportation of Muslims; not just Arabs.

and I'm sure you'll find similar ideas in /r/atheism towards christians. but besides all this; reddit hardly an accurate representation of public opinion. 

&gt; Obviously a situation like Tower Hamlets is completely unacceptable, but the vast, vast majority of British Muslims are content to live under UK law.

of course, but it's still an issue with some and discussion/debate needs to take place. think you over simplified it. 

&gt; Apparently they don't tolerate it - they complain to Ofcom.

as is their right. most don't though. and when they do they get told off for being babies. muslims not so much. 

&gt; Frankie Boyle doesn't have any real malice behind anything he says - it's all about getting reactions (and he's made some pretty scathing jokes about Islam in his time).

I can't find much; but I can find plenty of anti-christian stuff on his twitter. Of course it's about reactions; that doesn't change the fact that it is full of malice. 

&gt; icky Gervais...there's no accounting for him, really. I think he just seems like an unpleasant wee guy. Dawkins isn't a comedian, and is just as critical of Islam as he is of Christianity.

true, kind of, but there is a deeper motive there than simple 'throwaway' jokes. Gervais is big on atheism; it's more than a throwaway to mock christianity for him. don't see him doing much on islam though. 

&gt; I implied no such thing. What I'm saying is that actively anti-Muslim sentiment is far stronger in this country than anti-Christian sentiment, and reductive jokes about burqas or whatever perpetuate that.

well what I'm saying is that actively anti-christian sentiment (as expressed in jokes) only serves to increase anti-christian sentiment; it does not decrease anti-muslim sentiment. if you want to decrease anti-muslim sentiment you need to treat them as equals, which involves allowing them to be exposed to the same level of mockery as those of other faiths.

Fancy lights yes. You need a grow setup, but it's not quite as complicated as it sounds. Basically you need to give the thing light, air, water, and food, and you need to keep it at room temperature all the time.

Basically you'd need a single UV light, and keeping this properly simple, a pot with some soil, plant food, and a cupboard which isn't too isolated from the outside world. Ideally you'd have some sort of intake-exhaust for the space you were growing in, but your plant wouldn't necessarily die if you don't. Your plant will die if it's allowed to get really cold, so the space has to be about room temp all the time, which either requires making sure your space is heated, or that its placed in a part of your house that won't get freezing.

As for it being incredibly difficult, nah, not at all. Obviously you're growing the thing under kind of sneaky conditions so it's not like you're growing tatties in the garden, but it's called ""weed"" for a reason, it's a pretty resilliant plant and if you follow one of the many, many guides online you'd be able to get a basic grow setup for maybe £30-40 which could grow you a plant.

(Always fucking this), and then told me I'd be referred to someone who would actually do something in another 2 months, because after feeling all my fascial muscles and asking me if it hurt or felt strange (No on every count) she said she thought my issue was muscular.

Well, it kind of depends, clearly both anarchism and communism are conceived as Stateless and are unlikely to have a criminal justice system with legal professionals like the one operating in the UK today!  But this is well off topic.

A communist State is an oxymoron.  Not sure what a ""non-capitalist"" State would be, can you give a concrete example?

&gt;Difficult know since we mostly have broadly capitalist societies to compare, they certainly don't appear to exist in primitive or slave societies. I suppose similar roles turned up in feudal societies. But not really a relevant issue since Marx was merely describing capitalist society.

The last half of the 20th century was dominated by the cold war, the clash of two separate ideologies. Are you telling me that it was a big misunderstanding and really all state actors were capitalist?

All societies to some extent have some form of executive, whether that be in trade unions or corporations; in slave societies and very obviously in feudal societies - what was feudalism if not the implementation of multiple tiers of command-and-control?

I totally reject the suggestion that management roles are the creation of capitalism.

&gt;A communist State is an oxymoron. 

You're kidding, right? Wait- if this leads us to discussion of which form of communism is the purist, then I'll have to concede that I don't know enough about these various strands to properly engage on this with you.

Ok Mr Humourless lets not even get into the nature of the absurd overreaction to a joke and actually talk about the serious business of national identity you clearly want to talk about instead. I seemingly have touched a sore spot for you so I'm going to poke at it, not in a kid pulling legs of spiders kind of way but in the way the doctor pokes around to work out what hurts and why. (Ok that last bit maybe a lie)

Invading other countries and slaughtering the locals is part of our history. A significant part of our relatively recent history as it turns out. If you check my post history you'll find me talking about how I think this is a reason that a lot of English find outright displays of national pride and jingoism a little crass these days. In our history, in our culture, that kind of pride and belief in the nation is inherently tied up with the sad idea that we were also better than everyone else. Viewing European civilization as a pinnacle of a linear cultural evolution was a fault of a lot of western nations and lead to the idea that we could elevate the other, backwards, cultures and even that it was a moral imperative to do so. This lead to many awful things and a British Empire, which was really a English Empire for all intents a purposes that is probably the largest in the history of the world.

To ignore how that impacts on our national identity warts and all is to do it a disservice and your kind of reaction to a joke about the warts of our past, to brush it off, is to do a much larger disservice to our self. To be able to accept that part of our cultural heritage and laugh about it is one of the way we can deal with what is in a large way a huge amount of national guilt. As a nation we did hideous things and in terms of our culture I'd say we are still largely trying to deal with that.

So my guess is that you are getting so uptight about this because it's a part of our history you'd like to ignore rather than accept because accepting it means accepting a national identity that isn't all Roses and country gardens. 

And to respond to you point while summing up... you are right invading foreign lands and kills lots of innocent people as a result is not one overriding thing that makes up our national identity but you are engaging in foolishness if you don't think it's a large part of the history of that identity.

* The Botanic Garden
* The River (walk up from Midsummer Common - if you can get up to the towpath that starts from Water Lane you'll almost certainly see plenty of rowers out - particularly in the morning)

Other things that are touristy but still fun:

* Seeing colleges. The ones off the beaten track are just as good as the 'big' ones at the end of the day.
* Punting (don't get a tour guide though, just rent the punt direct and DIY). If you've got time, punt to Grantchester for lunch.
* Wandering around the city center. King's Parade, Market Square, and the surrounding streets are very beautiful and completely unique.

The problem is a lot of our debt is tied into our housing, and therefore the government seeks to protect that by keeping inflation as low as possible. It isn't merely a supply and demand issue, although that is certainly a factor.

A free market solution perhaps to prevent many of the problems we see with poor landlords and awful letting agents is to form Regional Tenant Cooperatives. As a tenant using a LA, you would be forced to use this scheme. An organisation which fights Landlords and Agents on your behalf, for a percentage of your rent. It will have tools such as specialised legal assistance and the ability to collectively lower rent in order to enact its wishes. For example, landlord refusing to replace an old untrustworthy door, then the Cooperative threatens the LA with a 5% reduction in all rents it receives from all properties in the area. Bham.

However, if you expand your view to Batman's involvement in the JLA, I think you would agree that Batman has to exist.  He's saved the world from enslavement/destruction a number of times through directing the other JLA members or direct action himself.

Paramedics will carry the full range of drugs for pain relief (not much point turning up to a major car accident with mangled victims if you can only give them 'gas and air'). If you are in such a bad condition that it’s too painful to be taken to A&amp;E without pain relief, you would be justified in calling them. They get called out for far less serious problems.

I think Aaron has a tendency to try and drive past opponents towards the byline, and that's more conducive to his strong foot being nearer to the touchline.  However, he's never really attempted to do the opposite consistently, has he?  He only started flipping sides semi-regularly this year.  Maybe with some confidence, training, and commitment he could actually be stellar from the opposite wing.  However, having him gives us tactical flexibility when we need a outside threat.  AVB's proven this year to be more flexible in his tactical philosophy, so Azza should have a spot regardless.

Specific to Sunday (and I think the last few weeks in general), I think the key cog in our creativity came from Parker being subbed off.  Unlike Sandro, Parker keeps forcing Dembele deeper.

For a while I was under the impression we'd signed him but I guess there were work permit problems, and now I wonder if he has a place anymore with us signing Garcia and Rodwell.  Naturally, if we did sign him we'd have to put up with all the thinly (if at all) veiled racism.

I've been keeping an eye on Jovetic and he's very hit and miss.  I think he'd work for our type of football, but I do wonder if - just this one last time - we really need to push the boat out and pick up a proven, reliable source of goals.  The likes of Jovetic or Lewandowski are good strikers who have a bit of room to get better, while Cavani and Falcao are already world class and are much more likely to come in and make an immediate difference.

We should probably try to keep Kolo as back up for Kompany (if Kolo is comfortable with his role in the squad) since a younger player wouldn't get enough opportunities to really develop, and I think it would be wise for us to look at moving Lescott on and getting another left-footed defender... ideally an older version of Lescott on less money and with no aspirations of playing in the next world cup... I don't know who most closely matches that description.  We've got Rekik for the future, but for the short term Nastasic needs a backup and Lescott doesn't seem delighted at the prospect.

I think it's not necessarily essential, but I'd like us to get another attacking midfielder that can challenge Nasri for the starting spot and allow us to rest Silva once in a while.

There has arguably been at least one in EVERY episode Clara has been in so far--but I don't think that this means that Clara and Rose have some inherent connection. Personally, I think that Moffat and the rest of the writing staff are playing with us; after announcing the news about the 50th, they know Rose is going to be on our minds more than usual. I think they're using that to head the fan theories off in entirely wrong directions just to mess with us. That or they're just subtly trying to increase hype/anticipation for the 50th. 

I, for one, absolutely loved Rose and was thrilled about the recent news for the 50th. I have also been catching the possible references and wondering if they mean anything. But I'm not obsessing, not theorizing, not trying to dig to the bottom of any sort of conspiracy theory. I am REALLY enjoying Clara, I think she and the Doctor have some great chemistry together, and I'm content to let things unfold as they will without trying to force a connection between her and Rose. 

I don't think it's possible to deny that there have been instances of things that COULD be interpreted as Rose references, whether it has been intentional or not. Perhaps we're more hypersensitive to anything to do with Rose simply because of the 50th, or maybe Moffat is playing with us because he knows we're going to be hypersensitive.

Surging up late into the box when we're threatening, and harassing opposition players on the ball.  However, AVB's formations don't utilize that.

I think if he could settle in a DMC role, he could florish again.  Sure, he doesn't have the passing acumen that Huddlestone has, nor the all-around awesomeness that Sandro has (who when he does push up, can retreat quickly and do his destroyer job), but he could do it admirably as a rotation option.

I think as he pushes up now, he ends up splintering the flow of the attack.

They needed a name to kill, and ""The Doctor"" was enough to kill one of his hearts - accordingly, the first part of my theory is that he has used The Doctor for so long it's a part of his identity. The second part is about his past: The very first Doctor was a grandfather. In the new episodes [Spoiler about latest season alert!](#s ""he talks about his granddaughter; see The Rings of Akhaten - the god of that system is called Grandfather. Coincidence?"") Thusly, the second piece to my theory is that he is Grandfather - older than the universe, and he played a hand in its creation and its destruction. An involved creator, protecting humans (his most creative, and (for now) most like him of all that he has seen) beings. This explains his ties to Earth, as well as his unwillingness to be violent or to kill. The final part of my theory is that his name itself is not tangible; the name Gallifreans called him is one, the name he uses is another. This part gets long-winded, and **I will not add a TL;DR!** You have been warned... Anyhow, in many cultures there are not just the two I have mentioned but *three* names: A name given (Grandfather), a name chosen by them (The Doctor) and their **true** name,which represents their identity, personality *et al* rolled into one. So, my theory concludes that he *is* The Doctor; he *is* Grandfather; what will be revealed is his name as **the summation of all his deeds; the final result of his actions.**

true,AgentUmlaut,null,null,"Heres the somewhat general rule of thumb/ reality I go by. Every time we got a new manager after Rafa was more or less adding 2 seasons' time/work/growing/learning to realistically(for sure, no joke) challenge top 4 and maybe title if something miraculous happened.


I'm not necessarily saying its impossible for a team(that hasn't been in top 4 challenging shape) to challenge top 4 and take a high position at the end of a season. Perfect example was Newcastle's run last year where they held a decent position in ranks for a team that was 12th the year before and newly promoted. But as you can obviously see, it's a different story for them this year.

I think Rodgers's practices and ways of running things are major steps in the right direction. His inclusion of younger players is absolutely brilliant and the positive results from it are great. It's helpful to have younger players with bigger game experience. 

Give him more time to build up and get the kinks out and I think we could be a lot more consistent.

It may be difficult for people who recently started watching Liverpool to understand all this since one might be puzzled how Liverpool went from years of back to back securing of a top 4 spot/being called one of the Big Four, to a team that has fallen spaces below fourth.

Having the ability to field the similar formations and teams for consecutive seasons is more or less the way Liverpool needs to get back into competitive shape.

true,TwelveBore,cnty-england,England,"&gt; Invading other countries and slaughtering the locals is part of our history

It's a part of most countries history. Not unique to England in the slightest. What is unique to England is people try insisting that it's the only part of our history.

&gt; A significant part of our relatively recent history as it turns out.

I disagree with that.

&gt; If you check my post history you'll find me talking about how I think this is a reason that a lot of English find outright displays of national pride and jingoism a little crass these days.

It's because they are made to feel guilty by people like you who insist that they are somehow celebrating the mass murder of people simply by loving their own country.

&gt;  This lead to many awful things and a British Empire, which was really a English Empire for all intents a purposes that is probably the largest in the history of the world.

ANYBODY who claims the British Empire was the English empire has absolutely NO idea what they are talking about when it comes to the history of the empire.

It was an empire of the British upper classes. Whether those people were born in England, India, Scotland, Ireland or South Africa.

&gt; To be able to accept that part of our cultural heritage and laugh about it is one of the way we can deal with what is in a large way a huge amount of national guilt. As a nation we did hideous things and in terms of our culture I'd say we are still largely trying to deal with that.

There is no ""national guilt"" except by people such as yourself with an A-level knowledge of history who have just read Karl Marx and feel like they have some insightful understanding of history that the rest of the country lacks.

&gt; As a nation we did hideous things and in terms of our culture I'd say we are still largely trying to deal with that.

France did hideous things. Scotland did hideous things. The Americans did hideous things. The Chinese did hideous things. Every country in the world did hideous things. It's not unique to England at all. Please stop trying to push this agenda. Nobody is having sleepless nights over it except for you.

It's an episode that I've shown several non-whovians (even people who aren't really into sci-fi at all), and not once has someone told me they didn't enjoy it. It's easy to watch as a stand alone episode because you don't really need to know anything else about the series except that it's about some guy with a time machine that looks like a police box (""The angels have the phone box.""). 



**BUT** keep in mind that while *Blink* is a fantastic episode, it's very unlike a lot of the other episodes. I'd file it away into its own category even. 

**ALSO** If you think the show looks ""a bit.... silly,"" then I'd recommend you *not* start off watching any Matt Smith (11th Doctor) episodes (not necessarily because the episodes are silly; the Doctor is). And while the overall quality and effects aren't as good in the 9th Doctor's episodes, *Bad Wolf* is a really cool idea. Sure, it's a bit cheesy looking and at times ""a bit.... silly,"" (mostly because of Jack...) but it's pretty dark too (people competing on tv shows for survival). Plus the 9th Doctor is a more intense and serious doctor compared to the whimsy (and I suspect emotional instability) of the 11th. All the episodes you have in your edit are 10th Doctor adventures, which isn't bad at all; I just think you should look into 9 as well.

Nope. Neither the British Government, nor our security services, nor anyone who knows anything about it is as knowledgable as you who can judge them to be insane. 

Its a shit situation. Best case scenario if we arm them, we get a liberal revolution and a functional democracy. Best case if we don't? A bloody civil war which only entrenches the terrorists.

But we only see a future version of himself doing it, so it is feasiable that we see the ""present"" version of himself doing it again. I doubt that will occur though. 
I imagine his name will just be some psychic episode that causes something to happen/resolve the paradox with Clara. Like the psychic link of his name causes something to ripple through time. That's just my personal speculation though. 

Due to the nature of  his Relationship with River, I imagine she will remain a recurring character until 11 regenerates, as we know that the oldest form of him that she knows is the 11th (since we've seen their last night together).

The problem with Korea isn't the concentration camps in the north holding hundreds of thousands of people, ordering terrorist attacks on innocent civilians to harm the South Korean regime, trying out Nukes, threatening every other country in the region, starving its own people to death and creating a totalitarian dictatorship without freedom of thought, expression or culture.

No, the problem is the fact that after the Korean War, the US rebuilt South Korea, made it a republic with full freedoms and the fifteenth largest economy in the world. Oh, and keeps some troops there as they are still technically at war with the largest military organisation on earth.

Seriously why do people hate the americans so much that they are willing to defend the most evil of regimes and see only the harm that american intervention has in its greatest successes? South Korea is capitalisms greatest success story of the last fifty years, not proof of american aggression.

He was not even played and fair play to Sturridge, he knew his ability and was rightly frustrated that he was not allowed to be played ahead of Moses and Marin and Oscar on the wing at least. 

But it's also hard to be a striker in this system. You rarely get the ball because there is a distinct lack of crossing from the wings so you have to go out wide to get it. Then it's a vicious cycle that because you are out wide A) when you get the ball all your channels are blocked off B) you're not in a scoring position C) The is no dynamic movement created by holding the ball up on the edge of the box, so your natural ability of speed and finishing is greatly diminished. 

You should rewatch the way we played with Duff and Robben. Drogba in the centre waiting for the delivery, and balls fizzing in and around the box, in the space, waiting for someone to latch onto it. 

Hell, even in front of Torres. Daniel Sturridge had the pace and touch and vision to link up brilliantly.

If we were playing Man United in a Cup round and we took those two matches as the two legs, then both teams would have played them very differently. The fact that we beat them 3-2 at Old Trafford would indicate that we would have 3 away goals, which means that when United went 1-0 up at White Hart Lane if it was the second leg of a Cup tie they would have needed to grab at least one more goal to win and knock us out.

However, because it WASN'T a Cup tie, they sat back and didn't attack us and eventually we grabbed a goal. Teams play completely different football depending on those rules. Arguably as well, if it was a Cup tie in our first match, I would imagine Ferguson would have played it a lot differently and definitely ensured they would stayed more responsible at the back than what they did when we put 3 past them.

To me, it's just a ridiculous thing to argue. If they were Cup ties then the teams would have played different in the first place, so you can't look at the games through a different criteria and think it proves something when neither team tried to fulfill that criteria in the first place.",0,1366740428,null,0,false,0,c9l31dt,t3_1cw2za,t1_c9l31dt,t1_c9kphhn,null,1431455653,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

He'll be 31 when the season starts, entering the final year of his contract, at a time where its imperative he plays regularly as the World Cup approaches. If we sell him we'll need a replacement, but not a replacement who's good enough to warrant significant time--that'll prove tricky. 

I hope the Tevez situation resolves itself in a way that sees him stay. He's a great asset when he wants to be and seems to be in a wanting kind of mood. 

I very much hope we can extend Barry at a lower price as I see very few options in this side that pair well with Yaya's unique skillset/playing style. 

Striker obviously needs to be addressed and I think everyone hopes Cavani is the answer, though with a deal supposedly in place with PSG that dampens our hopes. That leaves Falcao (who could land at any of five clubs it seems), Jovetic (who seems too similar to what we have now) and Lewandowski (who seems too similar to Dzeko--granted with a better touch). Don't know how this will play out.

I'd like to see us bring in an out and out world class winger, someone who can stretch defenses and provide real width; Sinclair obviously isn't good enough and Nasri/Silva don't fit this mold. 

Maicon and Dzeko should certainly exit, but I have no idea why everyone wants Kolarov out. We have a world class left back, we don't need a second.

This is not necessarily true at all because a cyclist/pedestrian collision often hurts the cyclist more because they are traveling faster, fall from a greater height, usually on a wrist and have a piece of metal between their legs. The pedestrian for them to even be seriously injured usually needs to be of a frail disposition—if you are young and fit you have to be unlucky to come away with something more than just bruising. I've been hit by a cyclist on a mountain bike run—nothing negligent—it's not pleasant but I'm glad it wasn't a car.

&gt; I don't think 'no-one cares' if a car jumps a light and mows someone down, but I think that specific circumstance is probably quite rare.

You've changed the context. Two thousand die each year on the road, twenty thousand are left with life changing injuries and no one cares (so to speak), it's accepted. A few dozen get hurt in a ""terror"" attack and countries get raised to the ground. Also not all red light jumps are created equally, I very rarely do it except when the lights aren't designed to register my presence, but there is almost no consequence to a cyclist trundling through a red light at 5 mph especially turning left or at a pedestrian crossing. A car nearly always causes danger. It's certainly more common than a cyclist killing a pedestrian in the same way and by far. I'm even lead to believe that cars running reds is more common as well.

Right, but then you have to show that he is (a) dangerous and (b) a terrorist. In which case, you can probably lock him up after a trial and due process. I'm not sure why an institution being ""foreign"" matters, but the SIAC and Court of Appeal aren't that foreign.

&gt;  The USA has a rather nasty and recent record for torturing prisoners, but you never see Europe blocking deportation there.

* English Court refusing extradition to the US on human rights (Article 5) grounds: [Sullivan v The Government of the United States of America](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/1680.html);
* ECtHR refusing extradition to the US on human rights (Article 3) grounds; [Aswat v The United Kingdom](http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2013/322.html).

It does happen, but rarely as it is a pretty high threshold to overcome. Plus, as nasty as the US is, Jordan is, supposedly, considerably worse. The US tends not to torture people, particularly those who are extradited there (as if they did, there would be a lot more extraditions blocked).

I get annoyed at idiot cyclists, but as the data published and available shows the danger they present to pedestrians is fairly insignificant compared to cars (even on the pavement), about 1% in terms of both injuries and deaths, with cyclists often being injured as badly or worse than pedestrians where there is a collision.

Unfortunately no data is available on causes of cyclist and pedestrian collisions, but I imagine it's probably as likely to be pedestrians at fault (even allowing for the legal obligation on cyclists to look out for them)

Funnily enough, I'm not perpetually attached to my bike and often both walk and drive, sometimes with my children.

* You need to apply for the new school through your current local authority. They'll send the application over to the new authority.

* You can pretty much ignore that deadline now because all people applying for new schools from now on will be classed as 'late preferences'. In my authority, if you're late you're application will be considered in the 2nd round of allocation (usually a couple of weeks after the first round of allocation).

* If the school you want to apply for is already full, you'll be put onto a waiting list. Since you're new in the area, the new authority will be obliged to offer you *a* school place, which should be the closest school to your given address (usually in a straight line distance).

* You can technically apply for a school anywhere in England from any address but you're likely to be bottom of any waiting lists until you can provide proof of address for the new area.

* Waiting lists are usually (academies and church maintained schools can make their own criteria) held in the following order:

1. SEN/In-Care children
1. In catchment with sibling
1. In catchment
1. Out of catchment with sibling
1. Out of catchment.

* You can apply for schools in Devon and Somerset but you can't have 2 separate applications in 2 different authorities. So you'll need to choose which school you want to put as your 1st choice, rather than having 2 1st choices (I hope that makes sense?)

true,imjustincognito,flair8,,"I'm not going to speak for everyone, but here is my take on things.  


For me, outside of getting to rub it in my Liverpool-following-friends' faces, I wasn't excited about his signing. I didn't see him filling the true-striker or creative VDV role we needed. Instead I thought Levy saw a nice opportunity to gain some American traction without it being blatantly obvious. He's a good player and he had a career season at Fulham the year before, so the purchase didn't look ridiculous.  


As the season as progressed, my main issue with Dempsey is that he's has been anonymous when on the pitch. I didn't grow up playing and I'm just starting to grasp tactics so I'm sure he's putting in a ton of work doing the small unnoticed things that help the squad...but honestly half the time I forget he's on the pitch until he blasts a prayer from outside the box or gets camera time mean-mugging someone after he went down to easily.  


Also, while not his fault, I am absolutely sick of Fox Soccer making him and his ""AMERICAN""-ness the centerpiece of any highlight reel or game teaser. I think that combined with so many really biased article comments from Americans complaining about his lack of time on the field or hyping his skills as better than so-and-so just kinda have me bitter. Again, not his fault.  


All that said, I don't dislike him. I love what he brings to the USMNT and as a Texan I've always taken pride that he's done well for himself in England. I just think he'd be better suited somewhere else.   ",0,1366743816,null,0,1366745188,0,c9l4cuq,t3_1cyaig,t1_c9l4cuq,t3_1cyaig,null,1431455032,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

Otherwise, people, myself included, have criticized Dempsey because he has played a position that is supposed to be a creative, yet attacking role.  He isn't particularly creative (he did have a pass to the right side of the box against City that was gorgeous to Walker), nor is he a huge goal scoring threat from his own creation.  He is a great scrappy goal scorer, see most of the goals he has scored.  But in the position he plays, it would be better to have someone that can both create goals for others as well as themselves, something that Dempsey hasn't entirely impressed with so far.  He has hustle and the urge to win and compete, but he isn't the most gifted player on the squad.  That being said, I think the amount of criticism he receives is similar to the criticism that Defoe or Adebayor gets.  They aren't really complete players, or at least having been playing that way so far this season.  Defoe can score, but when he doesn't he is anonymous.  Adebayor can contribute in a lot of ways, but scoring doesn't seem to be one of them.  Dempsey has been criticized because he can be anonymous for 89 minutes, pop in and score a goal from a cross at the mouth of the goal, and be done.  That isn't bad, but it would be better is he were not only scoring goals like that, but creating similar situations, something he seems to lack.

true,seanraf,null,null,"I may be completely wrong here, but this is just what my rationale is.

Dempsey, in my opinion, gets a lot of stick here because Spurs fans are accustomed to their attack, and thus their players, being fluid and swift. Spurs have had a reputation of living or dying by the counter attack, especially during the Redknapp era with facilitators like Modric, pace to spread the field like Walker, Bale, and Lennon, and clinical finishers like Rafa, Defoe, and 11/12 Ade. Supporters have grown to expect Spurs to maintain that style and any player who disrupts that fluidity is seen as ""off-form"" or ""unfit for the squad"".

Dempsey, even at his best, does not fit this style. He lacks truly elite pace, strength, and vision on the ball and, as such, occasionally disappears from matches or becomes easily dispossessed. However, while his strengths are those that contribute positively, they are just not strengths that seem to fit what has been defined as Spurs' style of attack. He is a technically sound finisher with a staggering work rate and an immense ability to find himself in the correct attacking position in the final third. He constantly puts himself in the right position to get on the end of a cross or net a goalkeeper parry. These abilities have shown themselves for Spurs this season, often against the run of play, and have saved numerous results for us, especially when our counter isn't working and we really have to work for a goal. Personally, I believe he adds more quality to the squad then he detracts but it manifests itself in a style supporters are not accustomed to seeing, and one that is easy to criticize except for when he delivers the final product.

And that's before we even consider the increased strength of cannabis (or not as the case may be).

Meanwhile the rate of mental illness, including schizophrenia and general psychosis has stayed the same or in some cases decreased slightly.  There isn't even any correlation between cannabis use and mental illness, let alone a causative link.

Parliament prorogues next week, and returns in early May when it shall progress to the Consideration on Report of the Committee over two days followed by third reading. The bill will likely progress to the House of Lords before the House rises for Summer recess. The Lords will probably begin committee stage either just before Summer recess or just after. 

Two points:

First, legislation takes time to do right. If it didn't, we might make mistakes that could have been avoided. The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) bill has 52 pages including the schedules. It [affects matters](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2012-2013/0126/2013126.pdf) such as building registration, pensions, benefits, human fertilisation law, equality laws, and divorce. It gives powers to the minister to make secondary legislation. Either we blindly trust that the government drafted this bill precisely right, or we scrutinise it and prevent defects. There's also the question of whether it goes far enough RE opt-ins and forbidding the CofE from conducting these marriages.

Second, if you just rushed through a bill you'd end up alienating a large amount of people. Maybe you don't mind that, but due process is a guard against US-style culture wars where one side refuses to accept defeat partly because they feel they've been mistreated.

For what it's worth, I'm gay and I support these measures. But I also support Parliament doing it's job instead of rushing things for the sake of grandstanding.

So many loyalists don't vote.

The ones who do so, and vote based on symbols of our culture, do so because it's pretty obviously under attack. You just had to look at the hatred aired on this forum over the flags issue to see what thinly disguised agendas were at work. Worse, we've a 'middle ground' holding the balance of power that couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery let alone a difficult message of compromise. And so long as the mythical progress of a certain perpetual 'revolution' is measured in terms of how much they wind up loyalists, this political deadlock is probably going to show no signs of moving on anytime soon.

true,TheGrumbleduke,null,null,"Based on [the back](http://imgur.com/zssUk5w.jpg), the group behind this is SPUC, or the [Society for the Protection of Unborn Children](http://www.spuc.org.uk/).

A quick perusal of their website suggests they are the sort of lobbying group that is usually associated with conservative Christians in the US. They appear to be opposed to abortion, assisted reproduction (IVF/fertility treatment), contraception (although in a sneaky way - arguing that most contraception methods may kill your unborn baby), (some) stem cell research and euthanasia.

They also seem to have positions on cloning, sex-ed in schools, same-sex marriage (obviously), and a few similar things.

They don't appear to be a charity, but do have a company set up for dealing with some of their stuff (SPUC Education and Research Trust). The average age of its directors is 63.

According to [this article](http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/mumsnet-vs-society-protection-unborn-child-sex-education) they claim to have around 45,000 members. They're not an exclusively-Christian group, and have a specific ""[Muslim Division](http://www.spuc.org.uk/about/muslim-division/).""

They appear to have close links to some Conservative MPs, but may not be that influential elsewhere (particularly given that it seems they have failed to ""win"" any of their issues).

From what I saw of their arguments against equal marriage, they are the usual nonsense (including that great line about how it ""denies that marriage is about having children"" - which is interesting considering their apparent opposition to IVF).

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I dont agree with the OP... but to clarify the British empire actually began as the English empire...

In the 1690s the Scots tried to develop their own empire. They put 25% of their entire national wealth (£400,000) on 10 ships with 1500 men and sailed to the Ismus of Panama (the tiny strip of land that connects North/South American) to setup a trade outpost that would stop ships having to sail all around the cape of South America. It was called the ""Darrien Scheme"" (wiki it). Anyway, it turned out to be a good idea on paper (and indeed a great idea 200 years later when the Panama canal was built with modern technology). 

However, after the scots arrived they had a few issues;

* The tiny strip of land on the map actually turned out to be an enormous 50 mile mountain range, covered in thick forest.

* The spanish who had already setup an empire in South america were not pleased to see them - nor were the locals who had become wary of foreigners.

* It turned out the natives didn't want to buy the sheep they had brought with them to trade... as unsuprisingly wool products aren't very desirable in hot equatorial climates. 

Anyway, when the surviving 500 men returned to scotland 10 years later it basically bankrupt their nation. This was because the failed scheme triggered an economic blockade with the other european powers (including England) who were trying to prevent the Scots from setting up a competitive empire against the powerful Spanish empire in south america. 

In the wake of the failed Darrien scheme the English encourced the Scots to vote for political union. This would give the English the safety of knowing the scots would not join forces with the French and wage war on them from two fronts, and it gaves the scots access to a sucessful empire which is ultimately what they had wanted. The English also sweetened the deal by giving them £400,000 of aid to cover what they had lost. So in 1707 the Scots and English signed an Act of Union.

**And that children, is the story of how Scotland and England came to be the United Kingdom.** It doesn't get taught much in schools because its a boring and incredibly embarassing example of how to fail at becoming a modern nation, only to be bailed out by your old adversary.

It's also the reason why it is deeply hypocritical to say that the UK should retrospectively deduct the North Sea Oil from their share of the national debt... because ultimately they were a bankrupt nation who owe what they have now to the rest of the UK (including Wales and Ireland). But of course the Darrien scheme is poorly taught and outside living memory... it also has parallels with the situation today, where a small but ambitious Scotland talks big on paper, but may well fail to deliver.

true,tatertot1000,rose,Rose,"Hello there.
I was really trying to be nice and just let you get mad at me and leave it alone. But because of the inaccuracies of your previous comment I am sorry but I will have to correct you. I get that you dislike Rose Tyler, but [this](http://burnupasun.tumblr.com/post/13477994011/rose-tyler-meta), [this](http://winterinthetardis.tumblr.com/post/17596288005/meta-rose-tyler-as-selfish-and-why-mickey-rose) and [this]( http://rynne.dreamwidth.org/284111.html#cutid1) may help you understand why I love her so much. It's fine that you don't like her. We are all entitled to our opinions. But, the parallels in the seventh season have been anything but ""ridiculous"". 

To start, props departments and costume departments choose their items meticulously. Everything is done for a reason and everything is hand picked. They don't just grab a couple of boxes that happen to say rose on them and shove them in a scene. They do not just grab a random tombstone and not notice the big rose on the front. They do not just choose any random pub in London. They do NOT just choose a song that HAPPENS to have the words ""wolf"" and ""lost and found"" in them. They do not do these things because they are AWARE fans are going to make assumptions. They would not just throw those things in because they were available. They were specifically chosen for a reason. What that reason is, we do not know yet. However, you should think more of the creators of Doctor Who. They have done everything for a reason. Do you honestly think the props and costume department thought, ""Hmm. We want to cover Clara's room in flowers. What flower should we choose? Daisies? That's perfectly common and doesn't link to anything. Naahh, lets choose roses. And lets not just put them in a vase in both her spaceship and her bedroom but also in her hair!! Yes this sounds like a fantastic idea and it has nothing to do with anything."" I'm sorry, but that just doesn't happen. You're kidding yourself if you believe they were just coincidences.

I'm not going to elaborate on the material things, I think you get my point. I'm just going to talk about the writing. My personal favorite so far was from [Hide](http://doctorwho.tumblr.com/post/48483423644/its-the-oldest-story-in-the-universe-this-one-or).

I'm sorry, but you cannot argue that this is not a direct reference to Rose, because the official Doctor Who blog reblogged it. There is also the fact that essentially the entire episode of The Bells of St. John is a parallel to The Idiot's Lantern, but I'm sure I don't need to point that out to you. There are many more, a lot in Hide, but I need to go write a paper. I hope that you can take all of this in and understand that while I may be a bias source, the creators of Doctor Who are not, and everything they are doing is for a reason and is important. 

As for your final comment towards me and my ""trying too hard"", I love watching episodes and finding hidden things in them. I do the same thing with books and with plays. I am a lit nerd, sue me if I prefer to think that the author made the curtains blue to symbolize the character's depressed mood, and not because the author wanted them to be blue. [this](http://weknowmemes.com/2012/06/what-the-author-meant-vs-what-your-english-teacher-thinks-the-author-meant/) 


I really hope that some of this has opened your eyes or changed your mind a little. I am sorry if I have offended you in any way; that was never my intention. Several redditors out there certainly seem to think that I have. (the downvotes). I am not being ridiculous, and I am not ""trying too hard"" to find ""Rose crap"". I hope you can understand that.

true,no_soul_ginger,flair3,,"American here.  As a Spurs supporter for more than a couple seasons, with Fulham-supporting parents, I was pretty stoked to see Dempsey picked up by Spurs.  He's always been a work-rate, full-90 player - something we were lacking a tiny bit in VdV...who either worked really hard but didn't last a full match, or lingered in the opposing half seemingly waiting for a long ball.

Dempsey also has some hold-up play skills - granted he's not as smooth on the ball as top-shelf strikers, but he makes up for it in size.  He's a big, strong dude, and you'd have to really commit to a challenge to knock him off the ball.

And the last bit, and why I think he has a role at Spurs.  He's a team-effort player.  Watch his movement off the ball and how he maintains shape when not part of the play...that's why he ends up in the right place as often as he does, because there's supposed to be a player there making the late run or following up shots.  When he's part of the play, he routinely (like Ade) pulls 2-3 defenders with him, making space for the faster, more gifted ball-skill players.  He can also take some pretty hard shots and doesn't seem to get the ""rush of blood"" when in on goal.  He doesn't shoot an excessive amount - quality over quantity.

He has a different role on the USMNT.  Big fish, smaller pond - he has to carry the team more.

I too hate the FSC and American media coverage of Dempsey.  You'd think they learned from fellating Landycakes for so long, but nope.  Good example of an overrated player, hyped out of his element.  I think Dempsey is a better player all around.

The club will also probably be looking to get rid of some of the first team players who didn't quite cut it this season, like Guly or Fox (although Fox is actually handy to have as a spare, and I think there's still hope for Guly).

2) If you'd asked me earlier in the season I would have said Centrebacks, but at the moment Yoshida and Hooiveld are looking pretty solid and with Fonte and Forren waiting in the wings there might be no need. One more quality winger/foward/attacking midfielder might be useful now we're moving up the table, but to be honest the team is looking pretty strong at the moment and I can't really think of any areas that desperately need improvement.

3) Next season we should be looking to consolidate our position as a mid-table club as opposed to a relegation candidate, and be aiming for a top 10 place.

But I’ll do you one better—what if the reason the TARDIS doesn’t trust Clara is because Clara is actually a TARDIS herself? The Rani is a scientist, after all, so perhaps she devised a chameleon circuit that takes on the form of living beings… except, much like the Doctor’s TARDIS, it got stuck on one appearance, which is why an identical-looking young woman keeps popping up in different time periods, and her apparent deaths are just dematerializations. So then, Clara is the Rani’s TARDIS. Also, she’s also the Rani, because, well… why not?""

true,OpticalData,tennant,Tennant,"I don't have a problem with Rose. In fact I'm a quite a big fan of her character and the way she evolved over the series (bar her fan-wank return in Turn Left - Journey's End). They are ridiculous.

Props and costume departments go with what works, what you're suggesting is as bad as those that thought Clara was Jenny because her ship had the same chair (The BBC and Doctor Who especially is notorious for re-using props). The pub name is common in the UK, the tombstone header is common. Prop department: I know, lets put these things in there BECAUSE THEY WORK. 

Either way, all of Series 7b, Asylum Of The Daleks and The Snowmen was filmed BEFORE Piper was cast for the 50th, before they were even in talks. No production would start building a massive story arc without having an actor/actress that is an essential part of it confirmed to be in it.

You know what, I can argue that it's not a direct reference to Rose, considering that blogs, official and not re-blog each other ALL the time If a good piece of artwork or writing comes up. If it had come from the BBC you would have a leg to stand on, but no it's just a piece of fan artwork.

Two episodes are similar? So what? It happens in television. It doesn't make it a link to Rose. 

You know what? I love watching episodes too. I love sitting back and enjoying them, debating with my friends about what things could mean. But Moffat's arcs are never subtle (and I refer to the actress confirmation reason above also), if there was a Rose theme we would know it. The mystery for this season is the origin of Clara. 

I write, I direct, I act. I know all about how colour is used to create a mood. But sometimes a coincidence is just a coincidence, they would not have put these things in when they were filming because they couldn't guarantee Piper for the 50th. 

You're a Rose fan, let the show tell her story. Stop trying to make something out of nothing.

The same logic I am applying here with transfers and wages is the same logic that was applied last season and lead to picking every player that would be let go. I was having this exact same discussion this time last year not only in regards to Henderson, but Carroll (again) and Downing. Nothing changes this summer.

It is all about understanding the new philosophy at the club and understanding how the manager works. You see it not only in the players that were let go, but also in the players coming in and the attributes they have and the way their wages are structured. Henderson, Downing and Carroll are the pieces of a jigsaw that when you have completed the picture you are left with 3 pieces that are a completely different color and you finally realize that they belong in another set.

Even without Henderson performing poorly Rodgers would still let him go, since it creates an imbalance in the squad and wage structure.

Why don't we just pass a law that makes it illegal to segregate children based on their parents religion? Is there a problem with that?  
  
I think controlled schools could do a lot more to make themselves more welcoming to students from a catholic background. Getting rid of the, usually protestant, act of worship would be a great start (this is completely alienating for pupils of other or no faith too). A broader curriculum in religious studies would be beneficial too I think.  
  
As for segregating children into grammar schools and high schools based on an 11+ style test, it  does seem a fairly blunt instrument.

One first teamer I wouldn't be surprised to see leave is Puncheon. Since he signed that contract he hasn't looked the same and hasn't started much. I wouldn't be surprised if that contract had a clause in it which we cash in on.

As far as signings go, I assume Cortese has his eye on a big name that no one's really heard of from the continent. If Scott Sinclair's price is right that might be interesting - still quite young, scores goals, can play in a few positions, and we have a headstart on our rivals for his signature with his bro coming through the system. 

Other than that we'll look at bringing through another young player or two. Maybe Stephens to challenge Clyne, Ward Prowse to continue to improve.

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"I posted this little analysis of what I think should happen in another sub reddit, and it looks like it will be appropriate hear. Sorry in advance for any mistakes. Note that I don't expect all of this to happen, I just think that at least a few of these things should. Tell me what you think.

We could use cover in a number of areas. Most pressing is in attack. Having sold Balotelli and with Aguero injured a good part of the season, we haven't been scoring nearly as much this season, and with the possibility of Dzeko and Tevez, both potentially leaving, we need at least one new striker. Bringing in Cavani would be a great move, and is likely to happen. If he scores as freely in England as he has been in Italy, he could replace both Tevez and Balotelli. I've also heard rumblings of Lewandowski, who would be a great replacement for Dzeko, especially considering that he is likely to head to Dortmund if he departs, but I don't know if that's as likely.

Other rumors out of Dortmund suggest Gotze could be coming to City, which would be great as we could use another playmaker, especially if Nasri leaves this summer, which he may. He has seemed to improve lately, and if he finishes the season strong, I would consider keeping him, if he's willing to stay. Otherwise Gotze or Isco would make good replacements, though I'd prefer Gotze. It may be good to pick up one of them whether or not Nasri leaves, just to have cover in that position given that we generally play with two playmakers, and if one is injured or tired from games in multiple different competitions, it would be nice to have a more natural substitute than Milner in that position—not that there's anything wrong with Milner.

We could do one of two things with our gap in the defensive midfield position. We could bring on someone like de Rossi (or maybe someone a bit younger), sell Barry and loan Rodwell. Or, we could keep Barry and rotate him and Rodwell, maybe playing both when a more defensive approach is warranted. Barry has an awful lot of experience, but he is getting old, and it would be great to have an understudy ready to take over when he is tired, injured, or better saved for an upcoming game. Rodwells fitness can be a problem, but he has impressed  when he has played, particularly with his performance against Chelsea in the league. Garcia has adapted reasonably well to the English league after a slow start, but I still doubt he has the quality that we're looking for. It may be best to sell him. If we go this route and still feel as though we need another DM, I'd love to see De Rossi or even the return of NDJ.

Loan out Sinclair and Guidetti to prominent but not too competitive European clubs (somewhere like Ajax or Malaga) as they need to play. Both players have great potential, but need experience playing at a higher level if they are to break into the squad, ideally against competition from the continent. This would be a great way to provide that. Rekik, Suarez, Lopes and Razak could also use loans, though likely to lesser teams.

Lescott should be sold I'm afraid, and if Kolo is also sold, which wouldn't be a terrible idea, it would be necessary to bring in another center defender, perhaps someone with a bit more experience than Nastasic, even though he has impressed. Some have suggested Hummels for this, but City seem to be eyeing a lot of Dortmund players, and there's no way they'll get all of them, and Hummels is lower on the list. He is a great defender though, and City will need a player of similar quality if they are to compete in Europe, as the prospect of Nastasic or Kompany getting injured or fatigued from games in multiple competitions is such that we will need more cover than I frankly trust Kolo to provide.

Kolarov is paid kind of a lot considering his contributions, and should either be sold and replaced with a younger cheaper player, or more widely utilized. He was one of the few players who adapted well to the ill fated 3-5-2 formation, suggesting that he may be comfortable playing in more forward positions, perhaps as a counterpart to Milner, when strong, crossing wingers are called for.

Buy: 

Cavani or Falcao, though I prefer Cavani. 

If we could get Higuain or Benzema without having to give up Aguero that would be a major coup, maybe they would accept Tevez instead.

~~Gotze, or if that's not possible~~ either Erikson or Isco, or someone of their ilk good enough to replace or supplement Nasri. 

A quality centerback, especially if both Kolo and Lescott leave, but even if it's only one of them. Ideall I'd like to see Hummels, but tha might be a hard sell.

De Rossi, or another similar player, preferably someone younger than Barry.

If Dzeko leaves, Lewandowski, Jovetic, or someone similar. 

If Kolarov is sold, another left back, someone younger and cheaper.

Sell: 

Tevez. He wants to leave and if he doesn't leave either this summer or next January, he'll go for free next summer, which would be a waste. I'd love it if we could trade him with Real for Higuain or Benzema, but I think that deal is just for Aguero, who I'm not willing to sell.

If his form doesn't improve and a suitable replacement can be found, Nasri.

Dzeko, but *only* if a suitable replacement can be found. We can't afford to sacrifice on firepower right now. 

Maicon, Garcia, and maybe Kolarov. 

Loan: Guidetti, Sinclair, Rodwell (if Barry is sold and a younger defensive midfielder brought in), and any combination of Rekik, Suarez, Lopes and Razak.

Edit: It looks like Bayern have activated the 37 million euro release clause in Gotze's contract. I don't know if that means he's definitely going there or if we could still get him by outbidding them but he could get prohibitively expensive fast, so it might not even matter.",0,1366754693,null,0,1366756616,0,c9l8pp0,t3_1cxw1f,t1_c9l8pp0,t3_1cxw1f,null,1431452907,5,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,5

Were you to study the history of the Acts of Union, you would find that, in fact, Scotland's national debt amounted to £160,000 sterling while that of England was £18 million sterling because of William III's interminable warmongering.

Modern historical thinking is that the saving of of these nobles, and the commmercial disadvantages incurred to Scottish trade following the union (it caused a major recession, as we would now call it, in Scotland), held back social progress for a century, as the landowners maintained their position at the expense of the up and coming merchant classes.

Well you can disagree the sky is blue but you'd still be wrong. If you don't explain why I've got nothing I can even attempt to learn from, I disagree in this context is really kinda fucking useless to anyone. Make a point or don't bother, this is not going to provoke positive decision and far from helping change my mind (and trust me I'm never more glad than when someone can convince me I'm wrong else I'd have not bothered with any of this) it simply makes me more sure I'm correct.

&gt;It's because they are made to feel guilty by people like you who insist that they are somehow celebrating the mass murder of people simply by loving their own country.

Well what if we should feel guilty? Did that ever cross your mind? I don't actually think that's the case and if what I'm saying make you feel guilty for loving your country then you clearly either don't actually love it or love an version of it that does not exist. My point is simply you seem to assume that loving your country is an inherent good or noble thing that shouldn't be questioned or interfered with. It's not noble in and of itself and acting like it is is not a healthy thing or any society.

&gt;There is no ""national guilt"" except by people such as yourself with an A-level knowledge of history who have just read Karl Marx and feel like they have some insightful understanding of history that the rest of the country lacks.

It's funny that you somehow seem to think having read things can be bad. But thanks, I've not read Marx in about 10 years and you've reminded me that I want a refresher on that. That you pick Marx for this is extremely telling actually.

I've not said it's unique to England but it doesn't have to be to be part of our culture and history.

The video you linked to seems only to show a small address to Saddam that would no doubt be expected of any person who wanted to actually have a meaningful conversation with a dictator like Saddam, I could be wrong. I'd be interested to see any footage of similar meetings Saddam had with other politicians to compare how they behave.

There isn't any evidence of him urging the killing of British troops, even the article has a disclaimer about the misleading nature of the title. This was an allegation used to get him out of the Labour party because they knew he would cause trouble by not towing the party line on the Iraq war.

Did you actually read what he said with regards to Julian Assange's accused behaviour? He begins by condemning it but argues it is bad sexual etiquette not rape. That is not being a rape apologist.

He's not a Muslim, why on earth would someone as outspoken as Galloway want a religion to dominate him? Now you got me on the carpet bagger though, he's definitely an opportunist and decided to offer representation to an area that would appreciate his stance. Not really any different from the way the main parties give the safe seats to the less competent though.

true,AwhMan,eng-eastsusex,East Sussex,"Which is why education about it is so important =/ So many younger guys who have previously been in the cupboard about their sexuality will suddenly start having unprotected sex because like, they can't get pregnant right? And who the fuck catches HIV anyhows? They don't seem to realise how much more they are at risk and *why* they are. It's not because gods punishing them, it's not specifically because they're gay. It's because the walls of your colon are much thinner then that of a vagina and are much more prone to tearing and bleeding so cum can more easily get into your blood stream. Whereas it's pretty damn statistically unlikely to do that with a vagina. And if you're involved with the queer community you should be even more careful in the same way you do in a small village with only a small number of young women... There's a more limited amount of sexy people for you to sex so shit spreads really fast. Someone made a joke in some trans youth group I was in about how if one of us gets the CLAP we're all gonna fucking get it... Because maybe we don't all have sex with every single person, but if you mix and match a little bit well then... Suddenly your whole group is fucked. 

I had very good sex-ed... On heterosexual penile vaginal sex. But everything else? Nothing. And I'm 20, so it wasn't exactly long ago. And it's not just us, there needs to be training for medical professionals. I know lesbians who have been refused pap smears because they're ""still virgins"" according to their doctors. When I as a trans person went to the GUM clinic they had such a hassle trying to process anything for me because of how the forms are divided by sex.

I don't like using the word so much but education is so heteronormative that we miss out on such important information and leads to so many problems. It makes me so mad that we're putting more and more peoples lives at risk because giving them proper education makes some people uncomfortable.

If anything, it's the breeders focusing to much on THC, which in my opinion is wrong and will cause more psychosis. Personally I smoke, but if I could go to an outlet where I could pick specific strains based on the THC/CBD levels I would love it and would have a benefitual effect in general.

Finding a dose which is medicinal but not disadvantageous to a normal lifestyle is apparently easier than with weed and its many strains. Professor David Nutt (former advisor to the DoH) is in an advocate and there are hints that it may be legalised even before weed for medical purposes. A colleague of his did an [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19j3fp/iam_dr_robin_carhartharris_from_imperial_college/), recently.

&gt; Well you can disagree the sky is blue but you'd still be wrong. If you don't explain why I've got nothing I can even attempt to learn from, I disagree in this context is really kinda fucking useless to anyone. Make a point or don't bother

I assumed you would be intelligent enough to realise me saying ""I disagree with that"" means I disagree with the premise you are suggesting.

We've intervened in conflict zones. Not akin to colonialism in the slightest.

&gt; It's funny that you somehow seem to think having read things can be bad

I think having a selective reading list and thus coming to a very selective view of a countrys history is a bad thing. You are very ill informed and it shows with your limited and rather futile argument.

&gt; Well what if we should feel guilty? Did that ever cross your mind?

Absolutely not. I have no reason to feel guilty.

&gt; I don't actually think that's the case and if what I'm saying make you feel guilty for loving your country then you clearly either don't actually love it or love an version of it that does not exist

You are taking a piece of history and attempting to apply it to what the majority of English people consider a jubilant day of celebration.
 
You are agitated by this fact. It annoys you that people may wish to engage in a day of national celebration, so you feel a great responsibility to bring up events from a hundred + years ago. 

You seem to despise the idea of national solidarity. 

&gt; My point is simply you seem to assume that loving your country is an inherent good or noble thing that shouldn't be questioned or interfered with.

It absolutely is a good thing. We should all love the countries we come from and seek to improve them and make them better. 

That doesn't mean ignoring the truth or loving things that are immoral. 

&gt; It's not noble in and of itself and acting like it is is not a healthy thing or any society.

The majority of people who struggle in society tend to be disenfranchised from it. 


&gt; I've not said it's unique to England

You have said there's a large amount of national guilt over it (which there is not). You said the British Empire was really the English empire (which it was not).

It's evident you think England is in some way unique in history for having done bad things. It's simply not the case.

&gt; You are the one pushing an agenda because you are trying to dismiss what is an important part of us as not being meaningful because it can also be part of other cultures and people. 

I'm not dismissing it. I just don't understand what possesses you to bring up such subects when a person says ""Happy St George's day"". A positive expression that you are attempting to turn negative. It absolutely does not come from a healthy place. It comes from the fact you hold a disdain for English national unity and that people celebrate this.

It's not about Alex Salmond or the SNP, Braveheart, tartan, shortbread or oil. 

It's about our ability to determine our own future, to set our own priorities and make Scotland a fairer society and more prosperous nation. 

Right now we live in the 4th most unequal society in the OECD and the current austerity cuts (which the IMF say aren't working) are taking more from the poor and less from the rich. I don't like that and I don't think it's right or just. It is the result of greed and selfishness and it's not working - the fake belief that economic growth is always sustainable and the inhumane  social belief that the individual should put themselves above all others, at the expense of all others. There is no invisible hand sweeping up the dregs if we're all out for ourselves.

I don't like it that 18 miles from my house are nuclear weapons that can indiscriminately kill hundreds of thousands of people. I don't want to kill that many people and I think that Scotland's share of the £115 billion required to replace those weapons would be better spent on anything else - absolutely anything you can think of.

I don't want to invade anymore countries, illegally or otherwise. Outside of peacekeeping I have no aspirations for Scotland to exercise military muscle or attract hatred and anger from others.

The oil's going to run out whether it's administered from Edinburgh or London. It's not the answer to anything long-term but there's enough around to be taking advantage of today and putting some money aside for later. I believe Scotland would have there own best interests at heart in this matter, I believe the UK's contingency plan is Iran (see above).

I want us desperately to lift our poor out of poverty, to invest in our children and sort out our awful health record. I don't have all the answers and there's plenty debate to be had and budgets to balance but I firmly believe that we'd be in a better place to tackle those problems with complete fiscal authority.

There's another thing money can't buy however and that's pride. I'm not talking about nationalism - I don't think we're better than anyone else but I do want to celebrate who we are and what we are. I love our culture, our humour, our music, our literature, our landscape, our history of invention and of scientific advancement. Above all I love our compassion for each other and our sense of equality and justice.  Scotland is awesome and it's sad to see and hear Scots putting themselves down thinking Scotland is the only country in the world that couldn't govern themselves. We need to give each other a national pep talk and be reminded of all the good things we enjoy as Scots and that we've already contributed to the world. The Scots are loved around the world - enjoy that! 

I think if we asked people all over the world if they think Scotland should aspire to independence we'd get great encouragement to go for it. I can't image begrudging any country their independence and I believe we are so fortunate to be able to approach the question at the ballot box and not the battleground.

Independence gives us an amazing opportunity to make our society, our people and our outlook on life better and that's why I'll be voting YES!

However, I am not convinced that we should chuck all our eggs in this basket just yet. Two key spots haven't really been filled and could lead to issues for the squad. 

Firstly, despite THudds outstanding contribution and passing attack, he could still cause us a serious liability defensively and mobility wise. Becoming more positionally aware and better with interceptions could see him make that role his own. Though I am not sure that this will happen and this may be a position which we either seek to fill in summer, insert Tom Carroll into or drop Sandro into and leave more of the passing to Holtby. 

Defoe actually fills the striker role well in this system, though we still need a top class striker as everyone knows. Defoe would be an excellent impact sub to have off the bench.

true,jvdbization,lfc68,,"I really, really like Rodgers.  But I don't love him yet.  Here is why I like him...

When was the last time a Liverpool manager had to start a season under such dire circumstances?  After the Dempsey debacle and Borini injury we LITERALLY had 1 first team striker for a large portion of the season.  (granted our 1 striker was one of the top 3 worldwide) But Rodgers had to play Jonjo Shelvey as false 9 in Europa.   Couple that with the burden of having to change the passing identity of the team, and our ridiculous fixture list in the first month of the season, and I'd say he has done an extraordinary job.   

Huge wins early in the season that would have made his job easier just didn't fall for Rodgers... be it a bad Skrtel backpass vs. City or a retarded red card for Shelvey vs ManU, fortune was NOT on his side during the delicate and critical early stages of his Liverpool career.  But he held it together, he stayed positive (too positive for some), and held the team together while developing the new identity. He also had to deal with cameras in his mug 24/7 for 'Being:Liverpool' during what was surely the most stressful period of his career. 

He has also shown his ability as a motivator with Enrique, Hendo, and Downing all finding new life after, what some would consider harsh criticism/ultimatums. He demanded they be better, and they responded.  Also in his management of star players: Suarez, who until 2 days ago, was starting to change his image by diving less and scoring more.  And Gerrard: who's specific training regimen has allowed him to play every single premier league minute this season. 

Most important of all: I've, for the most part, enjoyed watching us play this season.  We have looked *incredible* at times, even as consistency continues to elude us we were considered the in form team of the league following our Tottenham win (what a turn around in 1 year, from winless in first 5 to the in-form team for a stretch). We have undeniably made progress. ",0,1366762174,null,0,1366762604,0,c9lbdx4,t3_1cxuj1,t1_c9lbdx4,t3_1cxuj1,null,1431451647,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

&gt;""the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn. For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.""
&gt;Davies, John (1993). A History of Wales. London: Penguin. pp. 100. ISBN 0-14-01-4581-8. (via Wikipedia).

In the same way that King James VI of Scotland ruled England and Scotland without uniting the countries King Gruffydd of Gwynedd ruled (1055-1062) over Deheubarth, Gwent, Powys, Glywysing and Gwynedd without uniting them and indeed whilst paying homage and fealty to the English Crown. His was certainly not a united Wales but simply a group of lordships put down by violent oppression and held by the sword.

In the interim were the likes of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, Llywelyn the Great, Rhys ap Gruffydd and such and eventually we come to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd who was declared ""Prince of Wales"" and recognised as such under fealty to the English Crown, held then by King John. Llywelyn rebelled and was forceable removed at which point the English Crown took direct control of the lands of ""Wales"" (Deheubarth, Gwynedd, etc.) that Llywelyn had till then held. The conquest and annexation in the battles from 1282-83 became codified in the [*Statutum Walliae* in 1284](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Rhuddlan).

So it's only been 730 years since the actual annexation but that doesn't really take in the former positions where from around ~1000 AD onwards various lords/prince/rulers paid fealty and came under the overlordship of the English Crown.

So for example at the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton the English Crown included the lands we now call the Principality of Wales.

&gt;""The annexation was finally and legally ended""

You can't end an annexation. Annexation means that the additional lands are added to make one nation, a kingdom in this case. You can divide the land and establish a new nation however - that doesn't appear to be what has happened.

The repeal of the Laws in Wales Act doesn't end anything. England is still the English Monarchs Kingdom and Wales is still part of that Kingdom. Unless you're saying that the UK no longer exists (and by extension GB)?

I'll admit I haven't studied the very recent developments constitutionally (ie since the Welsh Assembly).

We can proceed simply by asking who the head of state of Wales is. If it happens to be HM The Queen, then which of her 3 kingdoms is Wales part of, Scotland, NI or England?

Really? For example, I have yet to read something on this subreddit regarding Orangeism/Loyalism that has been met with positive comments from people outside of that culture. 

To witness the unthinking insults that fly about this sub (and twitter, and whereever else) when someone mentions the word loyalist and then conclude that grouping is not the target of some form of aggression is pretty astounding to be perfectly honest. And that's before the media treatment is examined, when as the flags 'issue' proved, they're only interested in hearing Loyalists speak when they can report 'from the Frontline™'. But then, when leading journalists reporting on NI have a background in [extremist political parties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_McDonald_(writer) what do you expect but a 'war' right?

It may be a sham war, a 'war' designed to appease the revolutionaries and convince them they are making progress when they lost all hope of that the day they took their finger off the trigger, but a war it still is nonetheless.

&gt;The middle ground should piss everybody off

They singular failed to do that on the flags issue. Unless I missed their hard-hitting rebuke of Limavady Borough Council for failing to match Belfast's bold compromise...

I like how this assumes you can take care of one religion's working class whilst not impacting the other.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;Unfortunately for you, your argument is not as clear as the sky.

My point was simply that you failed to state why you disagree

&gt;I assumed you would be intelligent enough to realise me saying ""I disagree with that"" means I disagree with the premise you are suggesting.
We've intervened in conflict zones. Not akin to colonialism in the slightest.

Now you've explained your self we can see that we've got a incredibly different idea of what counts as relatively recent history. It's my fault for not being clear that I'm count the tail end of our colonialism as recent history given how long our history actual is.

&gt;I think having a selective reading list and thus coming to a very selective view of a countrys history is a bad thing. You are very ill informed and it shows with your limited and rather futile argument.

Actually I try to have a wide range of a leading list, if I've come across selective here that directly due to me making a joke about a given bit of our history and someone jumping on me like I'd killed a kitten. I've responded explaining my point of view on where the joke comes from and if you think that is the sum of my opinion or views then that's incredibly... narrow.

&gt;Absolutely not. I have no reason to feel guilty.

I see you've never met rhetorical questions before.

&gt;You are taking a piece of history and attempting to apply it to what the majority of English people consider a jubilant day of celebration.

I made a joke and while explaining that joke I've said that a lot of people feel the jingoistic nature of some of the displays of n national pride can come across as a bit crass. I won't make sweeping statement but the idea that the majority of people I know are jubilantly celebrating today is just at odds with my experience and I happen to know a wide cross section of people. In terms of my actual social circle most people today have been talking about Shakespeare and celebrating his birth which is nice.       

&gt;You are agitated by this fact. It annoys you that people may wish to engage in a day of national celebration, so you feel a great responsibility to bring up events from a hundred + years ago.
You seem to despise the idea of national solidarity.

As I said above I find the celebration of some people to be crass. As for national solidarity that has nothing to do with a love for a country. My personal views are left wing socialist, which by it's very nature is about national solidarity, of sacrificing to help those around you. It shouldn't surprise me that you accuse me of only reading Marx and then attack me for being against national solidarity. You think my reading is limited, I suggest you try reading anything at all as by the sounds of it you've not bothered to do so.     

&gt;It absolutely is a good thing. We should all love the countries we come from and seek to improve them and make them better.
&gt;That doesn't mean ignoring the truth or loving things that are immoral.

If you blindly love something you are doing so blind to the faults that need to be fixed.

&gt;The majority of people who struggle in society tend to be disenfranchised from it.

And your point here is what exactly?

&gt;You have said there's a large amount of national guilt over it (which there is not). You said the British Empire was really the English empire (which it was not).


I disagree....

But unlike you I've explained my reasoning so I can leave at that. You keep stating things as fact without bothering to point out where and why I'm wrong. I express myself in places like these because I think I'm right but I want to *know* I am so I'm actually begging you to explain your self here because there is always the chance you'll prove me wrong to myself and I will be grateful for it. 

&gt;It's evident you think England is in some way unique in history for having done bad things. It's simply not the case.

I'll pose to you the same question I posted to the person I was replying to, and it's not a rhetorical one this time. Is tea part of our culture? Because by your logic we can't talk about it as such without stating it's uniquely so. Which is frankly silly.

&gt;I'm not dismissing it. I just don't understand what possesses you to bring up such subects when a person says ""Happy St George's day"". A positive expression that you are attempting to turn negative. It absolutely does not come from a healthy place. It comes from the fact you hold a disdain for English national unity and that people celebrate this.

Have you seen the thread we are in? It's a bunch of people poking a bit of fun at the fact St George is the patron saint of some silly stuff. The fact you can't take a joke about is frankly a little fucking scary because you seem to be insisting that we place nation pride above a bit of self deprecating humour.

true,Atomicide,num22,,"Simply put, Dempsey is a player who excels in being good at many things, instead of excelling in one area. At Fulham this made him awesome because he could reinforce one area of the team, or help another excel. 

Like, if the team struggled with passing he could drop back and act as a link up to the forwards. If his team was passing well in midfield he could move to a more advanced position and give even more attacking options.

At Spurs the football is faster, more defined, and more direct at times. The ball often bypasses the Attacking Midfield position, either by going down the wings, or through direct through balls. A lot of the time the ball ends up in the Attacking Midfield position following a dribble, meaning the player who took the ball there will hang around as support. Dempsey is often just a bit player when this happens.

The pace of our game also means he has little time to make decisions. While someone like Defoe just has to think ""where is my best shooting opportunity?"" Dempsey has to decide if he is going to shoot, look for a rebound, collect a failed cross or a clearance, and many others. The pace and dynamic of our game means Dempsey can often be caught between decisions and positions, which may be why he seems to vanish from a game. He is essentially chasing his own team to keep up.

However that said, when we switched to a  4-3-3 against City he seemed to have a more defined role and knowing his job was to get into the box, he ended up in a scoring positions and was able to get a goal. If he slots into that position well and we use a 4-3-3 more often I can see him fitting in better.",0,1366763609,null,0,false,0,c9lbwh0,t3_1cyaig,t1_c9lbwh0,t3_1cyaig,null,1431451403,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,cacafogo,num5,,"Yeah definitely too late in the season to switch now.  I get the feeling AVB has had this card in his pocket for a long time, working with everyone in practice so they would know what to do in those roles.  Against City he finally showed his hand, and it was a damn good one.  However, I think it was more the surprise of the completely new tactic that they couldn't handle.  With the short amount of time we've seen this formation, it would be hard to say for certain whether the success was more due to the tactic itself or the surprise of it.  I think it would be very risky to switch from the formation we've used all season to something our players aren't as familiar with.  We caught City off guard but you can be sure every team we face now will keep that in mind, and so it might lose a lot of effectiveness.

I hope Gylfi's future lies on the left.  He has improved greatly over there this season and having a whole summer to work on it would certainly help.  He doesn't have blistering speed and I think the center suits him more, but I am of the opinion that you can never have too many creative attacking midfielders and don't much like the ""run really fast to the end line and cross it in"" mentality of more traditional wingers.

The tendency amongst UKIP supporters is to think that saying ""I'm not racist"" are magic words - they can propose policies that actually discriminate against minorities, they think that they shouldn't have to go out of their way to accommodate minorities (by, for example, auditing their company's employment statistics), but ""I'm not racist, because racism is bad and I'm not a bad person"".

Annexation is a legal term, which refers to the integration and incorporation of an area of land into a state (sometimes forcibly, not always). 1283 was the date of the *conquest* of Wales. In the intervening period of 1283 - 1535, Wales remained disunited; parts (the ""Principality"", roughly corresponding to the modern unitary authorities of Gwynedd, Ceredigion and Anglesey (+ bits of Carmarthenshire)) were ruled directly by the Crown, and nominally by the Prince of Wales. The remainder was occupied by a gaggle of *de facto* independent Marcher Lords. This state of affairs only ended in 1535 with the Laws in Wales Acts - the acts which formally annexed Wales to the Kingdom of England. To say that annexation occurred before 1535, and as far back as the Statute of Rhuddlan, is simply incorrect.

&gt;*In the same way that King James VI of Scotland ruled England and Scotland without uniting the countries King Gruffydd of Gwynedd ruled (1055-1062) over Deheubarth, Gwent, Powys, Glywysing and Gwynedd without uniting them and indeed whilst paying homage and fealty to the English Crown. His was certainly not a united Wales but simply a group of lordships put down by violent oppression and held by the sword.*

Not sure why you've brought up Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, but his rule and that of James VI are not at all comparable. One was a personal union brought about through the interbreeding of the royal houses, the other a personal ""empire"" forged by conquest. I do not believe you are correct in your assertion that Gruffydd ap Llywelyn payed homage and fealty to the English Crown, at least as ruler of a united Wales; he spent much of his reign at war with England or with one of its various Earls, and when his defeat came it ended with his death. The book you have cited via Wikipedia makes no mention of his paying homage or fealty to the King of England during those seven brief years (yep, I checked). 

I would not dispute your more general assertion that the rulers of Wales, from ~1000 AD on, generally (and unreliably) payed fealty to the English Crown. However, that does not constitute annexation.

&gt;*You can't end an annexation. Annexation means that the additional lands are added to make one nation, a kingdom in this case.*

Any condition brought about through legislation can be ended by the repeal of that legislation. Check out the pages of the acts:

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Hen8/27/26/contents

In case you missed it, here it is again:

""no outstanding effects""

If you wish to continue your irredentist wet dream, then I can't stop you, but that doesn't mean your belief is any more grounded in reality.

BTW, you've got your nations and states mixed up.

&gt;*England is still the English Monarchs Kingdom and Wales is still part of that Kingdom. Unless you're saying that the UK no longer exists (and by extension GB)? ... We can proceed simply by asking who the head of state of Wales is. If it happens to be HM The Queen, then which of her 3 kingdoms is Wales part of, Scotland, NI or England? If it's not a part of any then she is not the head of state - or did I miss a coronation/investiture?*

England is not a Kingdom. Scotland is not a Kingdom. Ireland is not a Kingdom. Wales is not a Principality. The **UK** is the Kingdom. The Queen is the Queen of the UK. She is not the Queen of England, or the Queen of Scotland, despite what common opinion may hold. The Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland ceased to exist in 1707, and were superseded by the UK. Wales, as a part of the Kingdom of England at the time of unification, became a part of the UK thereafter, and remains so today. It is a part of the UK, not of England, and if its distinctiveness within the constitutional setup of the UK has not been made clear by the mountains of legislation that reference Wales specifically, the government reorganisations that include not only the Welsh Assembly and Government, but the old Welsh Office too, and the repealing of the acts that first annexed Wales to England, then I don't know what will.",0,1366768843,null,0,false,0,c9lduv1,t3_1cpfud,t1_c9lduv1,t1_c9lbefv,null,1431450483,1,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,1

Basically, the gist of what he said was this: 

Based on what I know, the first five away games will be based on this seasons away attendances, then based on a different system which is yet to be finalised. There is a small percentage of away tickets that is allocated to the Premier club, but its a small number and to be fair they are City supporters the same as the rest of us. I think a points system will come into place after 5 games but not certain how the points would be gained? 

As you may have seen in that thread I suggested a 'tiered system' but I'm sure the club will know what they're doing and make sure everyone has a fair share when it comes to away tickets.",0,1366768854,null,0,false,0,c9ldv0i,t3_1csljd,t1_c9ldv0i,t1_c9jlodu,null,1431450480,2,false,bluebirds,t5_2wzy0,2

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"I have to somewhat agree, a revamp of transfer policy focusing mainly on young players and the whole 'building' thing is not necessary. We can actually just go out and get results now, like you said, it's not like we've been crap for 10 seasons and need some drastic change in direction - it's just two seasons, and this season is almost definitely going to be worse than those two seasons. We went nowhere in the two cup and the Europa League, and are looking set to finish at most 6th, realistically 7th. I, too, would prefer to have Benitez back if possible.

Also (mini rant), our defensive work has been very questionable. I like Skrtel and I think that he should be put in the team even though he doesn't do much of the whole passing thing BR wants him to do, cause he's really a no-nonsense guy and at least he can provide another threat when it comes to corners (which we have been terrible at ever since Skrtel got benched, I never expect us to score when we get a corner unless we attempt to play it short, which almost never happens). Unfortunately BR keeps sticking by Carra even though he messes up quite often in defence, just because he can command people and pass. Which is good and all, but he's slow and doesn't win many headers nowadays when going up against an actual striker.

On the other hand, I do think Rodgers is a good manager for plenty of reasons. He makes clever tactical changes at times that just completely changes the flow of the game, gets Downing and Henderson to start playing really well, somewhat forces Enrique to earn his place in the team and realise his left back position is not guaranteed by bringing Wisdom in. What I like most is that he isn't afraid to try new things, playing Enrique as a winger which ended up working out really well, bringing Sterling (as well as Suso and Wisdom) up to the first team for a large number of games, playing Shelvey as false 9 in cup matches, playing Jones ahead of Reina, again just to show that nobody has his place guaranteed in the team.",0,1366772411,null,0,1366772870,0,c9lf71o,t3_1cxuj1,t1_c9lf71o,t1_c9l9je6,null,1431449852,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I have a question for you, it might not be the most cheery topic but it's probably worth discussing at this point in the season. We'd be delusional if we didn't think that every club in the world is going to be looking at Bale during the summer window, so my question is how important do you think qualifying for the Champions League is in terms of him staying or leaving? Also, do you think it could be the case where we get an offer so large for him that we almost have to consider it, or is no amount worth it?

It's a massive revelation to me now to be living in a place with double-glazing, but the last year or two I was in my old place I learned some tricks for dealing with winters.

I, too, would never choose to live in such a poorly insulated house again, but if I had to I would do so without using the heating.

Things that make a big difference are a putting your feet in a bowl of warm water when your feet start to get really cold and taking a bath or a shower before bed.

I found that doubling up a summertime sleeping bag with a winter weight duvet was not quite enough on its own, but if I filled two 2 litre coke bottle with hot water from the tap then that'd be enough hot water bottle to often get me sweating overnight. 

I probably took my refusal to use heating a little extreme, but at the end of the day I resented paying money to go out the window. 

Renting sucks. If you're spending £150 a month in heating, then double-glazing might well save you £600 (?) (more?) a winter.

That is completely separate from the notion of actually having a relationship and/or sexual relations with a younger person. I'm not talking about that. The mere act of being attracted to a younger person is real, but the first thing which should be explained is that just because we recognize that as a people doesn't mean we are condoning relationships or sexual encounters or even conversations with younger people.

true,FlyingTinOpener,k9,K-9,"&gt;Watching her pine over the Doctor and him looking right through her breaks my heart.

You're saying that Martha was ""underutilized"", but that's kinda of entirely the point of her existence. No matter how *you* feel about Rose, the Doctor loved her, the loss is devastating, and his state of mind throughout this entire season is integral to how the story develops.

There's nothing more telling of this fact than the storyline of the Doctor getting hunted by the Family of Blood. To me, his decision to become a human and forgo his Time Lord memories probably as much to do with him wanting to escape from reality as it had to do with hiding from the Family of Blood. And then when push comes to shove, we find out that he wasn't hiding, but rather he was showing mercy. In one of the more serious and morbid moments of the season, the Doctor condemns the Family of Blood to fates arguably worse than death when he could have just as easily killed them all. It shows just how far the Doctor has fallen when faced with Rose's irreversible loss.

You said very correctly I think that Martha's season is all about mourning. So I would argue that the ""potential"" of the Martha character is intentionally thrown under the bus, so to speak, in pursuit of getting that point across. If Martha wasn't such a great character, her situation wouldn't be heart-breaking to watch, and the Doctor's misery wouldn't be as emphasized. In a manner of speaking, she's utilized very well by being underutilized.",0,1366781630,null,0,false,0,c9li9lb,t3_1cxa2j,t1_c9li9lb,t1_c9kuqf0,null,1431448333,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

What if you're happy to trade a nice rented house for a smaller owned house so you can have stability of knowing you can live there long term? What if you want to renovate a house?

true,FlyingTinOpener,k9,K-9,"There are a lot of references of the Doctor *leading* the Time Lords to battle, but I don't believe that the Time War itself was much of a ""ground battle"" in the first place. The ""soldier"" I envision the Doctor being is definitely more of a commander/general/strategist kind.

One thing to remember here is that the TARDIS is actually not meant to be flown by a single operator. There's some references to this made by River Song when she flies the Doctor's TARDIS. If I remember correctly, the 10th Doctor might have mentioned it as well when asked about why TARDIS has such a bumpy ride (aside from him being a sloppy pilot).

Also consider that there have been military TARDIS' before. The SIDRAT from the 3rd Doctor's era is a bit of a knock-off, built by a renegade Time Lord, but it goes to show that Time Lords had and used TARDIS' for combat. The Doctor himself frequently describes the TARDIS as the most dangerous spaceship in the universe, and refuses to take it into battle not because it doesn't have combat capabilities, but because it's *too* powerful and he doesn't want that kind of a *weapon* to fall into the wrong hands should things go south.

So we know the Daleks had massive fleets of very powerful flying sauces, equipped with several deadly weapons. How would you fight that? Have a fleet of powerful spaceships yourself. We also know that the Time Lords themselves have created weapons before (i.e.: the De-Mat Gun). So why would the Time Lords *not* have TARDIS' equipped with weapons? The Doctor likely led the Time Lords flying fleets of these TARDIS' to battle against the Daleks, and that's what's being referenced in the series over and over.

As far the Doctor *surviving* the Time War, I'm not sure where it is referenced that he survived by fighting on the front lines. He survived because he's the one who ended the war by putting all Daleks and Time Lords into a time lock for them to fight their war outside of time and space, where they cannot harm the universe.",0,1366788144,null,0,false,0,c9ljo4s,t3_1czbo6,t1_c9ljo4s,t3_1czbo6,null,1431447672,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Moreover, Hud's ability to defend well, spread the play with immaculate passing and his total effect on teams (causing their defence to have to track back, in case of his long passes, giving our team a lot more space in the centre, for someone like Dembele to run into) all make him a far better option.

true,sionnach,irish,Filthy foreigner,"Despite your condescending opening sentence, I do very much understand the issues. I do this for a living (risk management), have been published several times in highly respected journals and newspapers and am trusted by several banks to help them, with my colleagues, with this kind of thing. Granted, my expertise lie in investment banking not retail, but it's hardly a stretch. 

My point is that is we had only small domestic banks, the likelihood is that they would not be able to compete with larger banks who will have access to better wholesale funding. Banks do not, like some people think, work by taking deposits and lending these deposits out. They use the wholesale markets - and this are members of the capital markets. Most people's ideas of ""good old fashioned site banking"" is so far off the mark. Even the simplest banks are complicated beasts and the cost of reg compliance is such that being a small bank just isn't doable these days if it wants to be competitive. There's a reason that despite having a branch network, Handelsbank don't do very well in the UK - they're just not competitive and consumers don't want to give up good rates for ethics or supporting the little guy. Co-op (despite not really being particularly ethical at all) brand themselves as ethical, but again people haven't flocked to them. They've stayed at the big boys, even though it's trivial to switch banks. 

Given the European market in which we operate, there would be little to stop the likes of UniCredit and other large European banks getting in on the action like Santander have. These ""100 small banks"" would have a hard time competing. There is not much money in current accounts, so these competitors would leave he unprofitable pieces to these small banks and clean up on the parts of retail banking that make money - mortgages and lending, and a bit of bancassurance.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Science is more than one paper.

Absolutely.  If you're aware of any papers (not including any from the US - reason below) that show a clear causative link between cannabis use and psychosis then I'd love to know about them (let's just say I have a vested interest in these matters).  I've read a number of papers that show correlation, but to the best of my knowledge there is no reliable evidence demonstrating a causative link between the two.  I remain unconvinced (but open minded) because there's a similar correlation between mental illness and tobacco smoking and to the best of my knowledge, the prevailing opinion is that people with mental illness are more likely to smoke tobacco, rather than smoking causing mental illness.  I suspect that something similar may be happening with cannabis, but I'm not holding my breath waiting for anyone to research this further.

The problem with cannabis research in the US is that funding and authorisation to undertake research is controlled by National Institute on Drug Abuse.  Their mandate is specifically to discourage and reduce drug use, rather than to encourage honest and open scientific research.  They're not looking for answers, per se, unless the answer is the one that they've already decided is the correct one.  They will (and must, according to their mandate) refuse to authorise or fund any research that seeks to identify any positive effect of cannabis, or to disprove existing theories about the harm that cannabis may cause.

It's a sad state of affairs that honest and open science is being thwarted by political motives, but that's the way it is.  As a result, all cannabis research should be treated with some suspicion.  Not because the scientists can't be trusted or that the methods used in any particular piece of research are wrong, but because we're often only seeing one side of the argument.

The lower price point doesn't come from better quality staffing, streamlined processes or efficient management- it comes from under staffing, cutting corners and constantly fighting fires when those things inevitably lead the processes to going tits up. After that you deploy the smooth talkers and reps to the trust to calm them down and explain how everything will be fine and, wherever possible, how it's *their* fault.

The benefits provided by privatization are smoke and mirrors. A false economy. A conjuring trick. It *Looks* like it costs less with no negative consequences but that's only becuase one thing the private sector has become very good at it covering its tracks and blurring the issues to the point of becoming unintelligible. Even the savings are bollocks as after the tender contract runs out (usually after about 5 -6 years) you'll be left with your services in such a fucking mess there's no way in hell you can afford to fix the mess- so you need to pass it off to a private company again, hoping against hope that this one will be different.

The phrase ""violent crime"" is really silly because ""violent crime"" is a matter of opinion. Would snatching an old ladies purse be violent because it's human to human? Does breaking in to someone's house with a weapon deserve to be labelled a violent crime because they *could* be at home at the time and *could* be attacked?

This study is sensible, they acknowledge this issue in their methodology and pick a good solution: 

&gt; There are differing definitions of violent crime used across countries. In order to try and standardize the data as much as possible across peace indices, IEP uses the FBI’s definition of violent crime, which encompasses aggravated assault, rape, and robbery

The problem here is that when another UK study happens regarding violent crime they're not going to use the FBI definition, they're going to use the definition the government uses or they're going to form their own definition. Then the next time violent crime is being discussed somewhere people will bring up this study and compare it to another study and they'll say ""Look at the discrepancies! The UK is more violent that study can't be trusted!"".

Fortunately what it does mean is that when someone says that the UK is more violent than America and cites a study that says the UK has more violent crime you can be almost guaranteed that the American study will be using the FBI definition and the UK will be using the government definition, which includes literally every crime under the sun as being violent. Someone breaks into your house while you're at the pub? Violent!

Such a stupid fucking phrase that is steeped in misunderstanding and no matter what point you want to make (the uk is not violent, the uk is violent) you can find at least 10 studies backing it up because of how they define ""violent crime"".

true,mabye,null,null,"Well, your premise is basically that those incentives exist and can reasonably be 'got right'. I don't think there's actually very much evidence for that being the case. And in any case, you need the 'free market' to actually exist...which is all very well in principle, but seems very difficult to actually manage in practice. America is the standard example, where the capitalist healthcare system has quite naturally transformed any free market they had into a ludicrous mess. For instance, did you know America spends almost as much as the UK on *public* healthcare? The difference is, we get the NHS for that, whilst most Americans get nothing and must spend as much again on private healthcare!

&gt; So long as you can get the incentives right, it will work well

So I guess my claim will be, based on observation of other systems it is at least very difficult to get those incentives right, and I don't think it is an efficient path to take. Especially since the NHS is actually quite efficient overall, anecdotal evidence like the 'recent hospital scandals' is easily countered by equally anecdotal evidence of private elements also doing terrible things.

&gt;  If people are worried about the government incentivizing the wrong things, they should go for lobbying that incentivizes

This is a very bad argument. Part of the point is that getting it right is *really hard*. I'm not an expert. You probably aren't an expert. Almost nobody is an expert. Personal responsibility like that sounds good but is not actually a very useful thing to call for.

Actually, I'd argue what people are actually doing is the most sensible alternative; observing that the NHS is quite good overall, with a good reputation and fairly low cost (that's not low in terms of the number of 0s, which is a stupid statistic to use, but in terms of cost per person compared to other countries), and that attempts to privatise it are almost universally opposed *including* by the bodies whose lives they're explicitly supposed to improve, and saying...what's the point?

1. He suffers from not really having a specific role. The ""box-to-box"" midfielder I've heard people refer to him as requires mainly defensive strengths and then the pace and ball control to bring the ball forward - Livermore is good at a number of things, but great at none, which is his downfall, as we have an abundance of midfielders who have specialised roles who we can very easily play in ahead of him:

*  Dembele, Holtby and Sigurdsson for an offensive midfielder
* Sandro, Parker and (imo) Huddlestone as deffencive midfeilders 
* He won't get on the wings in front of Bale or Lennon

2. Another issue he has is a weakness in the air - I've not seen him win many headers and as a defensive midfielder that is a big issue. You can't have the opposing team's CAM or CM constantly beating us to the first ball in the air when it's nearer our box. Just too much of a liability

I mean, he is a good player, worthy of the Premiership, but not good enough to make the Spurs 1st team, and maybe not even the bench without injuries playing a role.

true,FlyingTinOpener,k9,K-9,"It really all fits together. You can't have Tenant's awesome 10th without Eccleston's 9th paving the way. Now Matt Smith's 11th is turning out to be more and more awesome every passing episode. I love how, for a few rare seconds, he abandons his usually goofy demeanor to say something *profoundly honest* about his persona (i.e.: ""I am definitely a madman with a box.""), and then carries on as if he didn't just intimidate the shit out of everybody. Totally brilliant.

But if you think about it, 9th is where ""it all began"". At the end of the Last Great Time War, the 8th Doctor uses ""The Moment"" (a De-Mat Gun he modified to affect millions instead of a single individual, according to the comics) to remove all Daleks and Time Lords alike from time and space, and put them in a time lock *""with Time itself resurrecting them to find new ways of dying, over and over again""*. Very morbid, no?

So how does the 9th come about? Doctor's 10th incarnation says that his 9th incarnation was ""born in battle"" - presumably during the events surrounding the end of the Last Great Time War. It's a big deal. Eccleston's Doctor is unique in the sense that he's incredibly fierce, has some serious anger management issues, and arguably has violent tendencies. He is, after all, the first Doctor succeeding the events of the Last Great Time War. Deeply troubled by what he's done to his own kind, we see with Eccleston the very beginnings of the funny and witty charade that hides the Doctor's real feelings, but he's doesn't have a grip on it yet and frequently breaks down when faced with pain and suffering during his adventures.

I think that makes him pretty special. Eccleston played a Doctor whose moral code is dubious at best and his conscience fails him too frequently for his own good. In numerous confrontations, his first response is almost always to annihilate the Daleks. It doesn't occur to him that he's not that much better than his mortal enemy when he gives into such fury and hate. The 10th Doctor later admits this himself when saying his (second) farewells to Rose. In Journey's End, the 10th comments that his Meta-Crisis version is born in battle, full of blood, anger and revenge - just like his own 9th incarnation. So he leaves the Meta-Crisis 10th with Rose in the alternate universe, knowing that Rose made the 9th a better man and she can do the same with the Meta-Crisis 10th too.

*That* more than anything else should put into perspective just how important Eccleston's Doctor was. He portrayed a crucial transformation in the Doctor's persona that will stay with him forever. It's one of the most permanent marks on the character that any incarnation has ever left in the history of the show. While Tenant and Smith portray it differently, both the 10th and 11th's witty, reckless, goofy mannerisms can nonetheless be traced to the 9th's ""defense mechanism"" for coping with the horrors he's seen and sins he's committed. In many ways, Eccleston had the opportunity to *define* the very fundamentals of the modern Doctor because he came first - and I dare say he did a helluva job with it, given the limitations the show faced in budgeting and writing in its first modern season.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I know both of us have discussed this at length on this board and i completely agree with the assesment i would also add the timing of Dempsey's signing contributed to the feeling.

When we signed Dempsey we had just lost Modric and VDV and prevailing wisdom across the board(s) was that we needed a CM that could serve as the offensive engine and (as always) a striker.  According to every paper, ITK, TV broadcast, website etc we were due to sign Joao Moutinho and either Llorrente or Damiao along with Lloris on the final day.

Well Lloris came through but Llorrente (evidently) told us to fuck off and Damiao remained unsigned as to better continue the worst soap opera surrounding Spurs possible and then the Joao Moutinho deal fell apart.  We did however sign Dempsey who had just scored 23 goals for Fulham the season before. Which seemed fantastic until you examined  how he fit into the team.  

He had operated best behind the striker or out on the wing crashing into the box for Fulham. Problem was that AVB favors a 4-3-3 and most felt that he would try to put us into that formation (none of us gave anywhere near enough credit to AVB for his flexibility and tactics at that time) which meant we really didn't need someone who slots in as a support striker, we had just signed Gylfi and Dembele who seemed like they would fit in the CM rolls with Sandro and we had Lennon and Bale on the wings.  Dempsey didn't slot into any of those rolls and he certainly wasn't a front line out and out striker.

So all the Spurs fans out there went from losing Modric and VDV (who is still a fan favorite) to feeling we were on the verge of landing a world class CM (Moutinho) and a front line striker (Llorrente/Damiao) to landing Dempsey, a hustle and grit player who didn't pencil into the lineup anywhere and was best described as a ""luxury buy"" aimed at increasing marketability of Spurs in the US.  

Add to that the fact that he didn't start scoring dozens of goals right out of the gate and he seemed often to be wedged into the lineup and he became the perfect outlet of frustration with Spurs personnel moves.

New list of public holidays once I am the ruler of everything will run as follows;

* 1 Jan - New Year
* 2 Jan - Hangover recovery (the Scots already get this one, but in place of another, we should all get this one as well as the others)
* 1 Feb - Imbolc (can call it St Brigid's day if you prefer, but it's one of the traditional quarter days)
* 1 Mar - St David
* 17 Mar - St Patrick
* Floating: Good Friday &amp; Easter Monday
* 23 Apr - St George
* 1 May - Beltane/Mayday (stuff this first Monday of the month nonesense)
* last monday in May - no idea why, but it's ""tradition""
* 1 Aug - Lughnasadh (old quarter day)
* last monday in Aug (again, no idea why, but I'm not giving back the one's we currently get)
* 1 Nov - Samhain (quarter day)
* 20 Nov - St Edmunds Day
* 30 Nov - St Andrews Day
* 25 Dec - Christmas Day
* 26 Dec - Boxing Day

Plus; half day on Christmas Eve &amp; New Years Eve... because no one gets any work done then anyway.

That gives us a total of 17 (not counting the half days), which is 1 public holiday more than China has (current world leaders when it comes to number of public holidays, but to be fair, they have only recently developed a 2 day weekend, we should be well ahead of them when it comes to days off!)

true,Cheimon,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"Interesting post, and I'll do a little more research before I offer a more thorough counter argument.  However, I would like to quibble a couple of points.

First, your argument that going for lobbying is stupid.  What I meant to express was that people should be supporting groups that employ experts who can deliver useful advice on what good incentives would be (ie professional lobbyists).  Not that people should individually work out the incentives and tell the government.  Rather than giving £10 to keepyournhspublic.com, surely it's much more helpful to give £10 to an organisation that's working on a more achievable goal?  I'm not really sure what the top link will do with the money, anyway.  Of course, this is highly dependent on what you think of the matter, so I won't pretend it's the core of my argument.

Second, your idea that it's bad because 'everybody' opposes it.  The conservatives included it in their mandate and received quite a lot of the public vote.  Equally, while I can't find information for nurses and other staff, [doctors were largely opposed to the introduction of the NHS](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/national_health_service.htm): large organisations have a tendency to dislike moving from the status quo.  

Also, I'd like to add that a comparison to the US is a bit unfair: they knock it out of the park when it comes to healthcare, whereas most places in western europe do it for the same or lower (Portugal has a spending of $2,690 per capita on health, though I can't claim to know much about Portugal's health care): http://www.globalhealthfacts.org/data/topic/map.aspx?ind=66 .",0,1366797648,null,0,1366797990,0,c9lkvp9,t3_1czrhx,t1_c9lkvp9,t1_c9lkpzp,null,1431447101,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

In our current system we have a double pivot with a destroyer and a box to box midfielder (although they switch roles often), you have to change the formation or the way we play to put Huddlestone into the team. 

To clarify, I think Huddlestone is a better player than Livermore and is far more useful to the team, I don't think Livermore will ever be good enough to make it and yes, he should be sold to a lower tier Premier league club.

Huddlestone has a role to play in a proper 3 man midfield (like the one we changed to when he came on against Man City), he doesn't work in the double pivot. If we change to this as our standard formation next season, then I think he will stay because he will get playing time and he is a quality player (although he hasn't ever been consistent).

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"Privatisation and the free market isn't bad. Of course not. It gets us loads of excellent goods for great prices. But the benefits (to the consumers) of a free market only appear under certain assumptions. These include but are not limited to: perfect information, consumer choice, no barriers to entry, price as the competing factor.

Any student of economics will tell you what will happen when any **essential** good becomes privatised. These assumptions don't hold. Remember, for a private company, the one and only goal is profit maximisation. Morality and social responsibility don't come into it.

**Perfect information:** The doctors have all the information, the consumers essentially have none. How can I know what treatment I need? I must trust the doctor to tell me. The information is skewed in favour of the seller. Profit maximisation dictates that they will take advantage of this.

**Consumer choice:** You can't pick and choose who does your surgery or who you get your life saving pills from. The surgeon is highly specialised and highly trained and must be to have a good chance of success. If you allow private companies to control this, they will get the cheapest surgeons they can. They aren't concerned about your outcome, they're only concerned that you pay up front. Same with pills, when profit becomes the only concern, can you trust your life saving pills anymore?

**Barriers to entry:** The same thing will happen as with utility companies and train companies. Theoretically we should have many companies competing to lower prices. Instead we get a few big companies forming an oligopoly, driving up prices bit by bit. They use their established capital and market share to destroy any newcomers before they can become a real threat.

**Price as the competing factor:** The basic premise of free market is that companies must fight to survive by minimising costs and competing on price. With health, they don't need to compete because we'll pay anything to be healthy. So in order to maximise profit, private companies will continue minimising costs (reducing quality) but also increase price just because they can.

You might say, ""let's just legislate to avoid that happening!"" But again, I point to the utilities and train companies as an example that our government is incapable and/or too slow in controlling these natural oligopolies. And if you're going to have to apply all these rules and regulators and oversight committees, why don't we just have the government keep providing it in the first place?

**In short, my argument is that, while the NHS may be financially inefficient in a few cases, economic theory shows that there's nothing to suggest that privatisation will fare any better. In fact, it will most likely drive up prices while lowering quality, all for the benefit of shareholders. As far as I know, there's no place in the world where private health care has ended up with better or cheaper health care for the whole society.**",0,1366798727,null,0,false,0,c9lkzzi,t3_1czrhx,t1_c9lkzzi,t1_c9lkmmh,null,1431447045,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

It is important to note, as you did also, that Portugal HAS NOT legalised any hard drugs at all.  The police there still actively search for and confiscate hard drugs.  Possession is now a minor offence, similar in severity to a parking ticket, but they still imprison major dealers and smugglers.  The main change they have made is in their attitude to addicts, which has changed from one of punishment to a more treatment based approach,  [Wiki](http://www.udetc.org/documents/YouthDrinkingRatesAndProblems.pdf)

If you compare the behaviour of teens in the UK and Portugal when it comes to problem drinking, the differences are quite [stark](http://www.udetc.org/documents/YouthDrinkingRatesAndProblems.pdf).  The Portuguese teens just don't have the same desire to get completely shit faced as the British ones.  The culture is different.

Cocaine use in the UK is already the highest in the EU [Data]  (http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/nov/15/drug-use-europe-most-popular-prevalent).

The use of legal highs amongst teenagers is [booming](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/03/05/legal-highs-causing-surge-hospital-admissions_n_2811089.html) - try googling ""legal highs UK next day delivery"" and you'll get an idea of what the market is like.  It would be unbelievably naive to think that if Cocaine were as available as this, consumption would not increase.  It would more likely sky-rocket.

The case of heroin is not so straight forward.  Portugal had the highest rate of HIV amongst injecting drug users in the European Union.  This was the main drive for them to create a new drugs policy.  In 1999  when the new regulations were introduced, Portugal had the highest rate of HIV amongst injecting drug users in the European Union, but It was generally reported that the Number of deaths and HIV infection from injecting had fallen from 1999 to 2012.  This was largely attributed to the new policy.

During this time, reported drug use among the Portuguese actually rose. ""According to statistics compiled by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) between 2001-07, after decriminalisation, more people took cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy, and LSD - but decreased in neighbouring Spain between 2003-2008.)"" [Source](http://fullfact.org/factchecks/Portugal_decriminalisation_drugs_effects-3276).  It is a widely reported misconception that general drugs use fell.  This is probably due to the fact that HIV infections and deaths from Heroin fell as as a result of the policy. The use of cocaine actually doubled!

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"Oh god, what chance do we have when such a joyless bean counting philistine is apparently 'fighting the corner for arts' in the government.

The cultural environment of the UK is one of our last remaining selling points in the global market, and arguably the only area left where we are able to punch above our weight.  It is crucially important to the economy, but to view it in the basest economic terms is unbelievable myopic and hugely self destructive.

An illustrative example is that of the British Film Council.  For years, the money that was spent on investment in film had to be shown to be making good, guaranteed returns, leading to the frightful spate of identikit gangster thrillers and piss weak British comedies that polluted our film output for years but made a steady if uninspiring return by Zeitgeist osmosis.  Finally we have dragged ourselves away from that model and more money now goes to backing films that are artistically worthwhile without so much focus on their commercial viability.  This bought us 2 best picture winners in 3 years with Slumdog Millionaire and The Kings Speech, both taking many times their budgets in global receipts, even though both films would probably have been ripped to shreds by accountants under the previous regime for not demonstrating sufficient commercial viability.  This example can be repeated throughout the art world, where any kind of government attempt at 'picking winners' is as doomed as it was when it guided our industrial policy.

Spending on the arts and culture in this country creates an environment in which commercial successful projects can thrive, but if every single project has to justify itself economically then the whole ecosystem is doomed.  The fact that our culture minister cannot understand this simple and self evident point is further proof that this government is full of blinkered ideologues who will not deign to let reality get in the way of their doomed Thatcherite blood orgy.",0,1366801103,null,0,false,0,c9lla79,t3_1d01za,t1_c9lla79,t3_1d01za,null,1431446911,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

It doesn't address the point that private healthcare may itself be considered unlikely to work well, in which you're better off lobbying against it and instead on improved public healthcare.

Their rate of gun homicide is still 10x ours (0.70 vs 0.07 per 100k). I also have massive problems with extrapolating from the overall crime rate in a very culturally and socially different country with a tiny population.
 It's also worth noting that Switzerland has [huge problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Switzerland#Immigrant_criminality) with criminality amongst immigrants, which suggests the low crime is a result of historic Swiss culture and not something easily recreated by their current public policy. 

It's also frankly bizarre to point at one country with low crime and high gun ownership and suggest there's any sort of causal link.

&gt; I believe in citizen gun ownership because I think that the good people in society generally outnumber the bad people, and I think that the good people should have the tools required to defend themselves against the bad people in society. 

The argument against gun control is not that the bad outnumber the good. The argument is that it's much easier to do bad things with a gun than to prevent them.

&gt; One of the reasons that property crime is lower in rural areas is the increased number of civilian gun ownership - it acts as a deterrent.

There is no evidence of this. There are tonnes of reasons for lower crime in rural area - population density is lower so there simply aren't as many potential crimes, social inequality is lower so there's less incentive to steal from those around you, the population is much older, communities tend to be closer so there's a disincentive from stealing from your neighbour etc etc. To look at all of these differences and say that crime is lower because of gun ownership (which is still very low) is absolutely insane.

&gt; Criminals will use guns regardless of legality, so making guns illegal just hobbles people's ability to defend themselves against criminals with guns.

Except this article, and all of the US, suggests this totally isn't the case. [So do articles like this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/02/01/british-gangs-use-flare-guns-now-because-they-cant-find-real-ones/).

Interestingly, they have a [lower overall murder rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate), only slightly at 0.7 to our 1.2. Their crime rate is also lower but I can't find anything firm and easy to read on that because comparing crime between countries is meaningless due to crimes being categorised differently.

I'd say that gives a mixed picture really, especially were you to add in the gun suicide levels, of which they are number 4 in the world at 3.15 and we are down in the relegation places at 0.17. 

&gt;One of the reasons that property crime is lower in rural areas is the increased number of civilian gun ownership - it acts as a deterrent.

Do you have a citation for this?

&gt;Criminals will use guns regardless of legality, so making guns illegal just hobbles people's ability to defend themselves against criminals with guns.

It's impossible to know this for certain but in countries where guns are more available there appears to be more guns used in crime, the example you gave of Switzerland seems to back this up because their [crime index](http://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp) is lower than ours but much more gun murders take place.",0,1366803841,null,0,false,0,c9llnvb,t3_1czu7d,t1_c9llnvb,t1_c9ll548,null,1431446733,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

If people can make a choice between which hospitals they want to go to and the ones that have opted to become private but free at the point of use end up being better quality and still not being too expensive, then that would be good.  I'm not saying it would definitely work, but wouldn't it be worth giving it a go, at least partially, to see if it can?

Since medicine already costs money, and we already can't choose who does our surgery (while the NHS still has an incentive to cut costs), how is this different from the current situation?
