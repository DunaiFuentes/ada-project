The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon: These are the first (but no longer the only) episodes to have principal photography in the US. I ain't spoiling a god damn thing, except to say these two episodes are unforgettable. Mark Sheppard and his father William Morgan Sheppard guest star.

The Lodger/Closing Time: 2010 and 2011 series eps respectively, but both have Craig as the companion. Closing Time is right after The God Complex and leads into Wedding, and has Cybermen.

Asylum of the Daleks: Daleks, Daleks everywhere. Your mind is going to get blown.

The Snowmen (Ian McKellen is in it... and this one is important for story), Bells of St. John, the first few minutes of Rings of Akhaten, Nightmare in Silver (more Gaiman, scary Cybermen), all of Name of the Doctor.

true,geekychristine,river,River,"Having been a former ""No, I don't want to watch Doctor Who, it's silly"" skeptic to an ""I'VE WATCHED ALL 50 YEARS WORTH AND IT'S NOT ENOUGH"" avid DW fan, I can relate to your dilemma. Ultimately, it depends on your friends' preferences, but I think DW is one of those shows that has a little something for everyone.

Depending on how much time you have, I've listed what I consider absolute must-watch episodes in **bold**, and why I think they're important. I tried to trim Series 1 down as much as possible for timing, but of course, you be the judge. It's tempting to sample both Doctors Nine and Ten, but I advise against showing Ten. Too many spoilers, not enough context. You want to whet their appetite to discover Tennant on their own. I usually tell people who want to start watching Who: ""Get through the 'awkward first date' of Series 1. If you kind of liked it, you'll probably fall in love by Series 2.""

My Episode List for Who Newbies:

**""Rose""**. It's like Doctor Who 101. As pilot episodes go, it's not great; the Classic Series throwback monster (Nestene Autons) are kind of corny for today's audience. But I'd still suggest showing this one first because it establishes the basics: the Doctor, the Tardis, etc.

""The End of the World"". *Skippable*, but this episode shows DW's potential: this show is NOT bound by space or time. It says, ""Yeah. We can pretty much go wherever the hell we want, thankyouverymuch. How about the year 5 Billion to watch the earth explode?"" *WHAAAT?!*

""The Unquiet Dead"". Definitely *skippable*, but a great sampling for those more interested in the alternate-history type episodes DW offers than the futuristic Sci-Fi stuff.

**""Dalek""**. As a DW purist, I hate to skip anything, but if you're limited on time, skip to ""Dalek"". This episode was the hook and sinker for me. Watching the Doctor react to his oldest enemy with such bitterness showed a darkness to the Doctor hitherto unseen. I absolutely needed to find out more about their history!

**""Father's Day""**. This was the first episode that proved to me that DW is not just fun, running, and aliens. This show's got some serious heart. Plus, it establishes the ever-important ""fixed points in time"" and ""crossing your own time-stream"" staples.

--------
At this point, if they're not sold on DW but they're willing to watch more, continue on, my friend! But I think the episodes above are a good sampling of the vast range of DW's storytelling: History, Sci-Fi, Adventure, Comedy and Drama. It should give them the idea without going too far into the storyline to spoil anything. Just keep promising that they have to finish the Ninth Doctor (who's great on his own), because Ten is a firecracker.
-------- 

""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"". Love or hate him, I personally think Steven Moffat's writing is fantastic. These are borderline skippable, but I think its worth watching both of these just to get to the famous ""EVERYBODY LIVES!!"" scene. Captures the Doctor's contagious joy and celebration of life, and one of the Ninth Doctor's shining moments. It also introduces Captain Jack, which would avoid any confusion about him for the next suggestion.

**""Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways""** There's hardly a need to explain why these are must-watches: the Ninth Doctor's final moments, and probably the most important event to ever happen to Rose. And Captain Jack as well, for that matter.

=========

&gt;3 examples off the top of my head

Are you sure ?


&gt;1. One lecturer who swears a LOT. Fuck, shit, bastard, wanker, etc.

Some people swear too much, I don't like this either. Have a word with the lecturer and tell them how you feel.


&gt;2. The same lecturer as above, a German kid walked into the class late and he made a Nazi joke, something to do with lebensraum

Unless you can quote the joke how can we give an honest opinion ? Just saying Nazi doesn't help.


&gt;3. A different lecturer was giving a talk on international careers or something. There were 2 black girls sitting at the front, and he said something like ""Are you foreign?"", they replied yes, we are from Nigerian, and he started talking to them about the scheme. Maybe I'm just sensitive but again, uncomfortable the way he focussed in on these girls and quizzed them just because they were black

Sounds to me like he quizzed them because they were Nigerian. Sounds like the scheme wouldn't have been any good to British students. How do you know he thought they were foreign because they were black ? Perhaps he heard their accents when they were talking. 


&gt;4. The final one, and yet again a different lecturer, made a comment about a university estates worker that he had a problem with (these guys are normally locals who are a bit grumpy), in the lecture he was talking about a bad experience he had with one and said ""I hope he's on minimum wage.. no, just joking"". 

Bad joke. Just tell him it was a bad joke.

true,[deleted],null,null,"1. Time Lords being limited to 13 incarnations (12 regenerations) was a plot point long before the TV movie. From what I understand, Moffat will recognize it as a hurdle he'll have to write his way around. He recently said in an interview, [""He can only regenerate 12 times""](http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-10-13/steven-moffat-on-doctor-who-regenerations-go-back-and-count-again--theres-something-youve-missed).

2. The Master avoided the limit in Classic Who by stealing bodies. In New Who, it's said the Time Lords resurrected him. I don't know how resurrection works or if the Doctor could make use of it.

3. No, all the evidence so far points to John Hurt existing between the Eighth and Ninth incarnations. (For one thing, the recent minisode had Eight regenerate into him.) That could make Capaldi the final regular incarnation, if Smith isn't the last already.

4. The last episode so far aired, *The Name of the Doctor*, appears to differentiate between ""Doctors"" and ""incarnations"". The Doctors we know all keep their regular numbers, even with an extra incarnation in there.

5. It does look like they're inserting Hurt into a gap between Eight and Nine.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"Irish nationalism in its current form was largely a fabrication of the 19th century, that took on an overwhelmingly religious character in the early 20th, the point at which it became a popular movement, rather than an elite one (or one concerned with specific interests, eg the farmers rights  movements in the 1830 Tithe war, and the Land League successes in the 1880s and 1903) .

Prior to that Ireland was at no point in history a nation, nor ever considered as any kind of cohesive unit, either in literature or political framework. On the vanishing small periods a creature known as a high king of ireland exists, it was a community defined role, not a nationally or territorally defined one, and highly limited in extent, and entirely subject to engagement with other local ""kings"" and nations. In terms of being politically part of ""Britain"" (or a political union spanning the British isles, ruled from London), we are talking a history of nearly a thousand years. That's vastly older than most countries we consider very old: Istanbul has been turkish for less time than Ireland was ""British"". Ireland was under an English King for not many fewer centuries than Durham was.

What it had, from the 16th century onward, was a majority ethnic population severely repressed on the basis of its religion. If you wish to look for a historical Irish ""nation"", it is to be found in that experience, on the basis of a religiously defined community.

Yes it is very wrong to dismiss the troubles as PURELY a religious conflict. But it is equally wrong to dismiss the troubles as NOT being a religious conflict. It is inflected with, and stemming from religion, and the history of the oppression of specific religions, and due to identification based on religious community, in every way imaginable. Particularly from 1910 onward where the Irish home rule discourse was transformed into being one of, and for, the catholic Irish community. 

*Edit* just to clean up my use of Britain. Obviously Great Britain does not exist in its political form in all these periods. However Britain/British as a notion of a pan-British Isles suzerainity certainly does.

Against a team that is going to look to sit back and hit you on the counter Vertonghen &amp; Kaboul is the best pairing. Speed being the key factor in choosing Kaboul over Dawson. Against someone like Man Utd, where van Persie isnt exactly the fastest striker in the world, i feel like Dawsons experience and timing is much more crucial than Kabouls strength and speed.

With the midfield, I'm not sure how anybody that has seen Spurs play in any facet over the last 12 months can say that Sandro-Paulinho is the best pairing. Not only is it the best pairing for Spurs, but I feel it could become the most formidable pairing in the League. Sandro unlocks an odd attacking style to Paulinho's abilities, where he is making runs forward of the number 10, and providing the extremely necessary second finisher in the box when walker/townsend/lennon/anyone is crossing in.

Chadli is grossly under-rated, and I think will become the starting left-winger once AVB gets sick of Townsends constant shooting, and Lamela establishes himself, err go Chadli-Lamela is the best winger partnership.

as for the other two, Holtby and Defoe certainly seem to work together as the best partnership, but if you're talking about a one-off game (which everyone apparently seems to think exists every week, rather than a squad-mindset) then there's no way you can choose either Defoe over Soldado, or Holtby over Eriksen, UNLESS Holtby is being played as a deep-lying playmaker rather than traditional AM/#10",0,1384944400,null,0,false,0,cdipzgv,t3_1r14rd,t1_cdipzgv,t3_1r14rd,null,1428583654,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

And unlike rent, eventually you get to stop paying your mortgage. Ideally before you plan to retire so that when your income drops your outgoings do too.

I know there are other costs involved in owning a house vs renting in terms of maintenance (my spreadsheet factors those in and I'd still be better off if I could get a mortgage on a house less than 200k - ideally less than 160k gets a bit close to the mark after that) taking a lifetime of rent into account.

It will be very difficult to travel alone if you have to support yourself since you're so young. Even if you find work you are not entitled to a minimum wage until you are 16 (only £3.68 per hour) and you will not be allowed to work more than 12 hours per week in a very strict time table. (Exceptions apply to children working in their own family business and are not relevant here)

Even if you have the money to support yourself and your travels already you can not legally stay in a hotel or lodging house alone until you are 16. 

These are the options I think you should consider 

1. Wait until you are older, in the meantime get a job to earn money for travelling and take English language classes. It seems like your English skills are already very good so try to find something advanced or specialist. Maybe there's a career you want to learn the lingo for or you want to learn more British slang.. 

2. Arrange to visit with a trusted adult who can act as your chaperone. This has to be someone that you and your parents/guardians can trust 100% of course. 

3. Arrange to stay with someone already living in England or with an English family. Again make sure you and your parents consider this carefully. 

4. Look at further education/work training in your area and see if any of it offers exchange visits or work placements.

You can explain that not all animation is for children and the second that same person sees Akira on TV (which is PG rated FFS): moral outrage.   Video games are exactly the same thing, yet you will find parents buying their child GTA, MW3 or whatever the clearly marked BBFC 18 rated game of the now is and boom: moral outrage.

What pisses me off isn't the porn filtering per say its the encroachment of children into adult spaces and the subsequent sanitising of that space to be 'child friendly'.  I have been in the middle of a game and someone has quite pompously said ""You can't say that my children are listening""... why am I in the wrong for pointing out that perhaps letting your children listen to a bunch of excited adults chat and rip on one another whilst you yourself play that self same game with those people isn't a good idea?  

All of this, the video game outrage, the anime outrage and now the pornography outrage boils down to this:  YOU as a parent were too busy with your own life to actually parent.  YOU sent them off to sit in front of the TV or the computer instead of parenting them properly, YOU couldn't be bothered to actually read the labelling on these things you brought and thus YOU are the one to blame that your child ended up in an adult area/viewing adult content.  

I don't go in to a childrens playground and start yelling obscenities so why the hell should I 'think about the children' when I've deliberately and purposefully gone in to an adult area to do adult things (whatever that may or may not be) for the explicit reason that I don't want to deal with your rotten crotch fruit?!

Our priorities on development is security, ease of transactions, then looks. But we hear what you are saying, and the looks shall be improved, things are already in the works.

IBWT offers (and we changed in the last 3 weeks)

* No international transfer fees.
* No exchange fees.
* Lowered verification criteria, making it much easier for people to get into Bitcoin. https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/verification
* There is a withdrawal fee (Royal Mail, viewable when logged in), but this can be removed by visiting Plymouth.
* Day trading (when there's enough activity ofc).
* Litecoin (for day trading to £ or Btc. By the way, Btc-e &amp; IBWT, have a window open on each and trade away with the ltc/btc/£/usd windows).
* Added Bitcoin &gt; Litecoin Trade window. https://ibwt.co.uk/en/ex/x/btc_ltc
* Added Litecoin &gt; £ Trade window. https://ibwt.co.uk/en/ex/x/ltc_gbp
0.6% fee (down from 0.8%)
* Resources/Archives - https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/resources - added 5 Resource items to assist customers (withdrawal verification is probably the most useful)
* Added graphs for each trade window and each (4) order book (these won't look interesting until there's more activity).

I think the constant coverage and portrayal of cycling as an activity for 20-50 year old men who want to 'fight' with cars in a battle for the roads - often costing lives - needs to be challenged, as it's creating an anxiety for other cyclists about whether simply using a bike is safe - whereas we do know it is safe for most cyclists most of the time, and has health benefits to boot.

I had the same thing when I was a member of motorcycling communities - it's full of a load of youngish adrenaline junky men who go to every trackday who make out that every day is a war with cages, whereas learning from some experienced riders you see it in a whole different way - riding was and is still the most dangerous form of transport but he had never had a collision in 40 years of riding. That really puts off people from riding because they see it as dangerous thrill seeking hobby, but it's really actually quite safe as long as you ride safely.",0,1384947882,null,0,false,0,cdiqhiy,t3_1r0014,t1_cdiqhiy,t1_cdidx70,null,1428583419,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

In theory, it's all of us via democracy, and the majority of us, it would seem, don't want the gun laws relaxed. ^(I don't really want to talk about how democracy is failing in the UK right now)

I support change in gun laws. I support making them stricter, making sure that if people want to own guns for sport then those guns should be kept either in the shooting range, or the hunting lodge, under lock and key at all times when they are not being used for the sport or maintained. I think that if you want to **use** a gun then you should have to participate in mandatory training and achieve a license before you're even allowed to go near one without supervision. I even think that toy guns should be banned, and teaching children to play with toy guns is irresponsible and reprehensible. I'm against sport hunting in general. I admit that hunting is an important part of conservation and management, and an important survival skill (I have hunted myself, in order to keep my survival skills honed), but I think that sport hunting shouldn't be a part of that. Any sport that encourages people to enjoy killing is, to me, barbaric in the same way that bear baiting is.

The Master is an example of this as if I remember he used all but one of his lives escaping a Black Hole (based on book lore) and then continually stole and possessed bodies to continue living seen in Classic Who and the Movie. I think it was only stated as a true fact in the movie, but that as we know was full of canon errors. However due to the latest Time War it's been hinted at due to the constant dying and regeneration of the Timelords it's twisted them to the 'killers of the universe' we get told in the Night of the Doctor.

It's been now written more in line with that Timelord's have 'energy' to regenerate, but the limit is still unknown. Moffat's already written an 'out' twice now on how they gain more. 

When Smith's Doctor got poisoned by River, he did in fact die, it was only due to River's regeneration 'dump' that  brought him back giving him more energy. Now we have information that Mcgann's Doctor also in fact died and it was only because of the Sisterhood he was given a new and controlled regeneration. So between the two 'deaths' it's still unclear how much energy to regenerate the Doctor actually has.

Then there is 'The Other' theory, which opens a new can of worms, however that is yet to be considered true canon as that plot was never finished from the old series and left wide open, so that can for now be ignored.",0,1384951478,null,0,false,0,cdiqzwn,t3_1qz97n,t1_cdiqzwn,t1_cdip3s5,null,1428583182,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I've spoken to and know loads of people who have lived and worked in London, and you seem to be the only one who tries to defend London as not being somewhere expensive to live.

Everything costs more in London, house prices, food prices everything, there's loads of statistics to back that up. Like ANY city there are areas you can live and not be well off, but those areas are, frankly, not going to be the area people think of when they think of ""living in London"". 

It's also a problem of relative richness, I have no idea who you are or what your friends are on, but I know plenty of middle class people bemoaning their hard times when they easily earn twice as much as my other friends.

However, to be a recognized currency under law, you need  to have an issuing body (e.g. a nation), so a nation needs to claim bitcoin as their sole denomination. So that it can be recognised as a currency, and then as an exchange.

Yet no country can claim that they are the 'issuing' body of bitcoin, so no one can claim bitcoin, and thus it can't become a recognised currency.

Once parents have mortgages and family income is tied up in bricks and mortar their kids are a lot less mobile and so less likely to 'get on their bikes' to look for work. 

There is a strong correlation between countries with cultures based around renting, rather than owning, residential property and high youth employment.

There are definitely social effects, some of which can be negative (pressure to have - certain kinds of - sex, gender relations, unrealistic expectations, relationship fatigue etc.), but it's also worth bearing in mind that there's porn and porn.  Admittedly much commercially produced heterosexual porn is sexist, if not downright misogynist, but not all of it is, and an increasing amount of porn is just self-recorded sexual shenanigans uploaded by voluntary participants doing what they do naturally.  The industry obviously needs to be kept an eye on, because of the huge scope for exploitation, and because it can and does shape our attitudes towards sexuality, gender and personal relations (which is a major if not the major part of life) - if you don't believe this, consider the fairly well established links between fashions in porn and rates of heterosexual anal sex and dipilation (such that the humble crab louse is now an endangered species) - but there's no need to consider porn as a _necessarily_ negative influence on humanity.

On the field i would say the Seahawks, for years the Seahawks were just the ""tryhards"" of the NFL...when they were in the AFC they would have good teams and bad but usually found a way to be entertaining in some manner (either out of good performance or sheer laughable performance), they were just always that team up in the Northwest that no one gave a whole lot of thought to but no one really disliked they have always had noisy crowds at home and occasionally would pop up and be a very dangerous team.  Now they are young and strong and built for future success. Sounds a bit like Spurs (though the Seahawks probably didn't have as much success as Spurs).

From a front office perspective i would say the Steelers or Patriots in that in the end both those organizations have a similar mentality and have for years (the Steelers for ages and the Pats for say 15 years or so)...winning and the organization come first, top players come and go and they manage to find replacements, they don't get held hostage by players, they always seem to have a plan B for personnel.  A player could be a fan favorite but once the organization deems their performance slipping or their pay too high they are moved on without a second thought and a alternate solution is used.  They realize on the field results outweigh a single player.  Spurs obviously aren't as harsh as that (that mentality is not as present in the PL) but we are a well run organization (in recent memory) that in recent memory has let top names move on and replaced with other talent and remained in the top half of the table (really since Levy got here).",0,1384955219,null,0,false,0,cdirsqk,t3_1r1yvk,t1_cdirsqk,t3_1r1yvk,null,1428582807,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,guernican,null,null,"There's a difference between ""London is an expensive place to live"" and ""you need to be rich to live there"". Apologies: I didn't think I needed to spell that out.

As you say, everything costs more in London. That's one of the reasons people get paid more when they work here. It's called ""London weighting"": you're welcome to look it up. 

&gt; Like ANY city there are areas you can live and not be well off, but those areas are, frankly, not going to be the area people think of when they think of ""living in London"".  

If ""living in London"" is, for you, only synonymous with owning a 6-bedroom townhouse in Chelsea, perhaps you need to visit the place. And, by the way, reasonably well-off middle-class people bitching about how hard it is to make ends meet are not exactly difficult to find in any city of any country. 

Finally, and just to answer your final point: I dont agree. First of all, most people here - or anywhere - aren't ""well off"". Far more than half of the population earns less than the mean wage of c £27,000. On top of that, I don't understand what you mean by ""the rest of the UK's standards"". In Middlesbrough or Sandbanks? In Bray or Chester? Your argument makes no sense. 

There are rich and poor throughout the UK, just as there are in London, and just as there are in any city in any country anywhere on the planet. I realise it's very convenient and reassuring for people to depict London as some kind of banker-infested fantasyland where you're either flying to work on a magic gold unicorn or you clean anuses for a living, but - surprisingly - this isn't the case. As for living elsewhere: well, many people - including myself - work in industries which are primarily based in the capital. It would be exponentially harder for me to do what I do in Leeds, even if I did have slightly - and only slightly, given that the same job tends to be less well-paid there - more money. But then I wouldn't live in London, which has - rightly or wrongly - more culture, diversity, gastronomy and suchlike than anywhere else in the UK. 

You don't have to like the idea of living here, or have any desire to whatsoever, but please try to reconsider your ill-informed opinions. If you gave even the slightest thought to what you're saying, you'd understand how silly you sound.

I disagree: 

- 3 CB's against Giroud meant we wasted one man, which was criminal given how overrun we were in midfield

- Wingbacks left us vulnerable to overlapping runs by their fullbacks, which is what led to the first goal

&gt; If Cissokho plays, then a 5-3-2 would probably be better in order to shut down that right side of theirs (our left) where they are the most dangerous.

How does the 5-3-2 shut down their right hand side? Also, that's their less dangerous side - Coleman doesn't get forward as much. Mirallas is still tricky, but the combination play between Baines &amp; Pienaar on the left is far more threatening.

true,wish0r,lfc12,,"&gt; 3 CB's against Giroud meant we wasted one man, which was criminal given how overrun we were in midfield. Wingbacks left us vulnerable to overlapping runs by their fullbacks, which is what led to the first goal

We were always going to be overrun in the midfield. Simply because our midfield is not as good as theirs and they play with a lot of midfield players. The first goal was due to poor tracking from Lucas and Gerrard. Cazorla never ever should have gotten to the ball if one of them would have sticked to him as they were instructed. 

&gt; How does the 5-3-2 shut down their right hand side? 

If Cissokho is not sound enough to defend his side, we need to get another player there. Sakho or Agger as the leftmost CB would do. Their right side is more threatening than their left. While the left side got Baines and Pienaar who combine very well, the right side has Mirallas who drags the defenders out of place for Lukaku to run into the vacanted space. If Mirallas has a bad game, Everton have a bad game. He is the man to stop. If you let him run riot like last year when he skinned Wisdom the whole first half, he will get yourself into dangerous situations.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"On the Arsenal game:

- Yeah we were always going to be overrun, but you can reduce the degree to which it happens, surely? Again, that extra man at the back was absolutely wasted, and that's poor tactics.

- I agree that Gerrard/Lucas not tracking contributed to the goal. But that doesn't mean Sagna overlapping and overloading that area wasn't also a contributing factor. Also, to relate to my point above about the wasted man at the back - had that extra man been in midfield, you would have had one more player to track midfield runners.

On Everton:

- The 4-2-2-2 also allows us to get another player to defend there, namely Coutinho, in front of Cissokho. While not as good defensively, he would be better placed to prevent a run from deep from their fullback causing an overload. But I can see how you could get the 3-5-2 to do it with the CB shifting over.

- Mirallas is a good player, but I honestly don't think he's worthy of doubling up on. Him tearing us apart last season had more to do with his opponent being Wisdom than him being their biggest threat. But as the article shows, Everton direct most of their attacks down the *left* flank.

Lastly, anytime we haven't played 3 at the back this season, we've been playing 4-2-2-2 - 2 CM's, two 'wide players' (who roam and come inside) ahead of them), 2 strikers. It's *certainly* what we played against Fulham:

              Sturridge    Suarez

    Coutinho                     Henderson

                Lucas    Gerrard


    Cissokho    Agger    Skrtel    Johnson

                   Mignolet

I wouldn't call it a 4-2-3-1, because Sturridge and Suarez were both equally high up the pitch - they took turns to drop deep and move wide, but that's just natural centre-forward movement. I wouldn't call it a 4-3-3 because Henderson undoubtedly started on the right, even if he moved inwards (though really, Coutinho moved centrally much more than Henderson did).

In the games before United in the League Cup - the first time we played 3 at the back - it was the same setup, but with Aspas instead of Suarez, and Moses in for Coutinho against Swansea.",0,1384961704,null,0,false,0,cditw20,t3_1r20im,t1_cditw20,t1_cditem2,null,1428581831,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

The brakes work, yes. They're Shimano cantilevers (I forget the exact model). Even though I rode it fixed, I made a point to always have two good, working brakes.

I built the bike from the frame upwards, so I'm pretty well-placed to answer any more questions you might have about it. There's nothing on the bike that's broken, if that's what you're asking.

true,wish0r,lfc12,,"On the Arsenal game: 

Given the quality and ressources we had, I thought Rodgers did the right thing with how we lined up. Had our midfield not let us down perfomance-wise, and our attackers convert the chances they had, we could even have won the game. It's not as if Arsenal were very dominating when attacking. They simply flooded the midfield but never really looked like scoring. Cazorla's goal was really just poor poor tracking while Ramsey's goal war poor tracking aswell as a wonder goal from outside the box. Sure, they dominated our midfield but our defence was very organised and didn't break down (Kolo's error aside).

On Everton: 

Agree on the Coutinho part. But he could do the same in a 4-3-3 formation. The 5-3-2 would prevent an overload even better, the only downside is that we have to drop either Coutinho or Henderson. If Sturridge is injured following yesterday's friendly we can fit Coutinho and Henderson in there with Suarez being the lone striker. But then we can't hit hard on the counter. Better hope Sturridge is fit. 

In my opinion Mirallas is their best player offensively. Shut him down and we completely shut down attacks from the center AND the right side. I know that Everton attack most of the times from their left but that doesn't mean it's dangerous, especially with both Johnson and Henderson there, I don't think their left side will get much out of this game. 

&gt; Lastly, anytime we haven't played 3 at the back this season, we've been playing 4-2-2-2 - 2 CM's, two 'wide players' (who roam and come inside) ahead of them), 2 strikers. It's certainly what we played against Fulham

That's the point: We didn't play 4-2-2-2 against Fulham. We played an inverted triangle midfield i.e. Lucas as the sole holding midfielder and Gerrard, Henderson and Coutinho ahead of him. A very good post match analysis of this can be found [here](http://tomkinstimes.com/2013/11/liverpool-4-fulham-0-in-depth-tactical-analysis-2/). In terms of formation, you could say that we played a 4-1-3-2 against Fulham. This works well, also against Everton. But Cissokho doesn't fill me with confidence down that left side which is why I would go with a 3-5-2. This means we drop Coutinho but since we play away from home, this is a sacrifice I would be ready to take.

Of course, landlords _can_ be incredibly hardworking, both outside of their ownership of property and in improving and maintaining properties, attending to tenants' needs etc.   But the point of fact is that they don't _need_ to be, it is ownership which provides the income, and for that reason we can call this income unearned.  It's the same argument as when people maintain that capitalist owners of businesses are all entrepreneurs working their nuts off all hours to imagine, create, develop, expand and improve their companies.  Of course, it's true for some, and perhaps for most at some points in their business' lifespan, and to that extent (the extent to which they expend effort and do labour with their hands and brains), they are acting as workers not capitalists and should be remunerated accordingly.  However, to suggest that the Walton heirs today are hardworking entrepreneurs in the manner of Sam Walton is frankly laughable, and it's even more ridiculous to suggest that a shareholder in Walmart is 'working' - all the actual labour is being carried out by (minimum wage and heavily State subsidised) employees and managers.  This is unearned income, as, ultimately, are all rent, dividends, interest, capital gains, etc.  To take an extreme and clear example for rent, it's perfectly possible to invest in rental income/property without any active role in dealing with tenants or property management whatsoever.

So two examples:

- buying a barrel of oil at $50, selling at $100 the next day = unearned profit

- buying a barrel of crude at $50, refining it, selling petrol at $100 = earned profit

What happens in real life is that you take the crude at $50, refine it, and then market prices have gone up and its sold at $200. So it's a combination of earned and unearned profits.

This isn't bad in itself, you can argue it's simply arbitrage and accumulating value 'left on the table', but the problem is when people can make more money by investing in things which are subject to scarcity at times (food, medicine, land etc.) and selling or renting it back to market, than by investing in something which adds value. This causes capital to be distributed into scarce assets (driving up the prices see: rare wine / rare art) instead of being usefully employed.

In some cases where the good in question is essential to life, there is a question of whether a disincentive to unearned profit on those goods is important: as not only does it increase access to that good to more people, but it also encourages those with capital to invest in the 'earned profit' bucket (so, you would make it profitable to buy and redevelop old housing, rather than buy an ex council and churn tenants through them).

I have no beef with people making money (my family in particular has made lots and lots in property), but from an economic perspective then yes I think it is better we encourage capital to be utilised on building underground mansions, new houses, bringing old houses up to modern standards - instead of buying up housing stock and simply holding onto it. That's not to preclude ANY landlords, just in my view we need a marginal shift away from capital going into purely holding assets, towards capital going into asset development and investment.",0,1384963863,null,0,false,0,cdiurnm,t3_1r1o58,t1_cdiurnm,t1_cdismd1,null,1428581423,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; Don't like it? No problem - let's have an exclusive tax on cyclists to pay for the infrastructure they seek - it won't be cheap or easy to get planning permission for such large scale changes to much of the countries roads - so it'll probably be quite a large tax. We are in a financial crysis after all - austerity etc. - so hopefully you'll be prepared to pay for what you want.

The ones from each Doctor that will be most relevant to the 50th:

**First Doctor**

- *An Unearthly Child* (first episode is the only really relevant one)
- *The Daleks* (first Dalek episode)
- *The Dalek Invasion of Earth* (first time Daleks are a major military force)
- *The Chase* (Daleks get time travel)
- *The Time Meddler* (first non-Doctor Time Lord, though species isn't yet named)

**Second Doctor**

- *The War Games* (introduces Time Lords and Gallifrey)

**Third Doctor**

- *Spearhead from Space* (introduces Doctor's Earth exile)
- *The Three Doctors* (dramatic expansion of Gallifrey and Time Lord lore; introduces Omega; first multi-Doctor special)

**Fourth Doctor**

- *Genesis of the Daleks* (if you watch any Dalek story on this list, make it this one; RTD claimed this is the start of the Time War)
- *Terror of the Zygons* (Zygons return in the 50th)
- *The Deadly Assassin* (set entirely on Gallifrey)
- *The Invasion of Time* (set entirely on Gallifrey)
- *Destiny of the Daleks* (Probably not super important, but I've included all Davros stories on here)

**Fifth Doctor**

- *Arc of Infinity* (return of Omega; mostly set on Gallifrey)
- *The Five Doctors* (mostly set on Gallifrey; 20th anniversary special)
- *Resurrection of the Daleks* (again, another Davros story)

**Sixth Doctor**

- *Revelation of the Daleks* (yet another Davros story)
- *The Trial of a Time Lord* (season 23; the last two episodes are the most relevant; introduces the Valeyard, and the biggest indication of Time Lord corruption so far)

**Seventh Doctor**

- *Remembrance of the Daleks* (last classic Dalek story; second-most-important after *Genesis*)

**Eighth Doctor**

- *Doctor Who* (1996 TV movie)
- *The Night of the Doctor* (released last week; short prequel to the 50th special)",0,1384973059,null,0,false,0,cdiyywy,t3_1r23cc,t1_cdiyywy,t3_1r23cc,null,1428579432,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Whoever can cut through the middle will have an advantage. Suarez and Sturridge do this naturually, but Lukaku is also very good at this.

true,JamesB5446,cnty-scotland,Cleethorpes,"&gt; If you make a stupid move - and it causes an accident - it doesn't matter what you were using at the time, it's on your head.

&gt; It's that simple. Trying to absolve cyclists of that responsibility is a scary prospect that paves the way for more accidents in the future - fuck that.

What stupid move could I do on my bike that could harm someone in a car? Other than making them swerve and hit a wall or something? In that situation, I agree, I have a responsibility not to do that. But in general it's crazy to say that the person with a much higher potential to cause harm shouldn't bare more responsibility. 

&gt; Not really. I've been hit by drivers twice in my life - in the first instance the lady responsible had a) her car written off, b) her insurance paid me damages c) possible charges, I didn't get involved. The accident happened as she hadn't checked the brake fluid on a car she had just purchased - her responsibility. I am content that justice was served.

a) Small car or fat bloke? b) as it should c) ah, so you don't know if she was punished or not? Not sure how that disproves my point.

&gt; n the meantime we have registration of vehicle license plates, as well as necessary insurance for vehicles - failure to do these things is a breach of the law. Bikes do not have to do any of these things and can be operated unregistered and unmonitored.

Because, going back to my main point, cars have a much higher potential to cause harm than bikes. The test is harder for trucks and the insurance is higher. Because…they have more potential to cause harm than cars.

&gt; Cyclists can (and do - I see it daily) make stupid moves on the roads that would get them seriously injured if an accident were to occur. It is the responsibility of the cyclist to choose to make these moves and place themselves in jeopardy.

Totally agree.

&gt; If folks like you travel the streets with the opinion 'but I can't cause damage to cars, so it's not my problem - it's someone else's' it's little wonder we see people getting hurt.

Well it's good that folks like me don't have that opinion then. I've been hit by a car. Once the adrenalin wears off it fucking hurts. It's something I try very hard to avoid every day.

And yet, she's supposed to be such a puzzle... Everything important about Clara doesn't involve Clara herself, which is why she's a horrible companion.  

She's Martha Jones but even worse.  I really hope she dies soon.

Far more cyclists are motorist than the other way round.

I don't think I'd ever want to take a long distance coach, it sounds horrible.

&gt; Funnily enough, it's all for one and one for all when it comes to paying. I've no issue with cyclists paying for access to the traffic network - it's your choice how you wish to use it and here's the interesting bit:
All cyclists can go on a road. No motorists can go on a cycle path.
That means you have access to something motorists don't. That's why you pay.

But the point is it's not my choice how I wish to use it. Most roads are horrible for most people to ride on. This isn't the same for drivers. 

&gt; Cool - so long as cyclists involved in accidents are held fully accountable for cycling without due care and attention and police campaigns target and fine cyclists traveling without high-viz clothing, helmets and lights on at all times. Oh - and all cyclists have to register their bikes of course.

In what way is any of that sensible?

Agreed. But you're not totally cutting off that sense. And it's not a sense you rely on that heavily when cycling.

&gt; All the aspects of road safety should be studied - not just better mirrors for trucks but also where cyclists could be improving themselves as well.

Agreed.

true,H_Savage,null,null,"No! Hull is a city with some really fantastically good points. You can't have missed it being all over the news today for winning City of culture 2017. Well, that was well-deserved. 

Hull has a brilliant art gallery, which has had exhibitions by Hockney, Warhol and Da Vinci within the past year. Its annual Freedom Fest music festival had more than 80,000 visitors and some big names in comedy, music and dance. Read more here: http://www.freedomfestival.co.uk. The city's former fruit market has been regenerated fairly recently and is now a popular student draw, which hosts some great bands/acts. You also get plenty of good stuff coming to the theatre, the Welly club and the arena.

It also has some lovely museums and a beautiful old town, where there are loads of nice old pubs. There are more lovely bars and restaurants on Princess Avenue, some of which are really nice; there's tapas, Japanese, Mexican, bistro food and pretty much anything else you would fancy eating. 

The shopping is better than you might imagine; st Stephens shopping centre has all the big chains you'd imagine like Zara, Topshop/man, Next, etc. and the city has department stores like Debenhams and Housemof Fraser, plus some independent shops in the old town.

I don't know if you have a perception of it as being poor with high crime rates, as this seems to be a fairly common preconception, but as a young woman I've never felt anything but safe there. It's generally a very friendly city. Like anywhere, you don't take unnecessary risks and of course there are areas with pockets of much higher deprivation/crime. 

You might be surprised by how attractive it is, there are many beautiful buildings and the river creates some lovely sceney. There's plenty of other stuff within a very short distance, including the coast and lovely market towns.

There is genuinely loads to recommend Hull. Of course it's not perfect, and it's very much a working-class northern city - but that's by no means a bad thing.

I did a semester in London, and met a very nice Spanish girl.  A year later she got a scholarship to come to the US.  So her brother and his GF visit us, and we meet them at the airport.  We were going to take a free shuttle bus into Manhattan, and apparently the Bangladeshi driver misunderstood me, because we ended up a hotel in Queens.  So I went in to the lobby and had the concierge call us a cab, and I gave the guy a few bucks.  My GF's bro looked like he saw a ghost.  I'd never seen anyone so shocked in my life.  he asked his sister ""Why did he give that man money?!?!?!?!""  So yeah, I guess it is shocking to others.

During my first few weeks in London, I would always give the bartender an extra pound for my beer, they didn't like that.

It is funny how little things can be shocking.  My first weekend in the UK, we took a trip to a very rural part of Wales, and stopped at a little town for lunch.  I went to a snack stand and got a hamburger, and took a bunch of ketchup packets.  The cashier told me it was 1p or 5p a packet.  My head nearly blew up.  My brain could not comprehend it.

I was looking at a comfortably well off pensioner's bank account recently. He had something like £15,000 in his current account and was receiving a good sized state pension with a private pension to back it up. I noticed that he had received a £100 winter fuel payment.

It made me think about the contrast between the old and the young in the 21st century. He gets £100 to help him with fuel bills despite the fact that he clearly doesn't need any help, while others who are struggling to find work in an economy that cannot provide 100% employment get told that the handful of change they are supposed to live on is being taken away from them due to some supposed infringement.

If we play Holtby there, we're going to be missing a bit in terms of the attack.  Holtby is very energetic, but isn't the passer Eriksen is.  Gylfi would give us a little more bite going forward.

Who is a better option than Gylfi on the left?  I'd say our best pairing would be Lamela/Townsend.  Because ou'd only play one on the left, and the other on the right, that's one option better than Gylfi.  After that, your options are Lennon and Chaldi.  Lennon on the left is an awful plan.  Chadli, as I said before, has a very small sample size with Spurs.  I don't think he's been particularly brilliant in that sample size.  If AVB continues deciding to not play a left footed winger on that for reasons I assume are perfectly valid, then we really only have two options, and neither is clearly better than the other.

I find faith to be a beautiful thing, personally.

I often wish that I had more opportunities to discuss faith and non-faith in a tolerant and open setting. Even amongst friends I find that the labelling you mention is so pervasive in society that I'm scared to open up for fear of even my closest friends thinking, ""Holy shit. cbfw86 is actually completely insane,"" even though they might actually appreciate my opinions and I might appreciate theirs. For example I find the humanism and the strong sense of 'living in the present' and the ideal of human progress that is often the conclusion of atheistic philosophy to be quite moving and emotive in many ways.

I guess ultimately we are all trying to make sense of the universe and our complex existential baggage we seem to have been uniquely lumped with as a species. It would be nice if we could put aside the idea that we are Amazing^TM and capable of understanding the universe (and its meaning to boot, if there is such a thing) and accept that when it comes to both individual and collective exploration of human nature and philosophy there are many roads that lead to the peak of a mountain.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I think firstly we need to be glad that there are people like Edward Snowden who speak out when they see stuff like this happening and let the world know, whatever the consequences for them personally. There must have been thousands of people involved in this mass surveillance program, but luckily one person saw it was wrong and felt strongly enough to speak out. We need to support these kinds of people.

Secondly, we need to defend the right of the Guardian and Channel 4 etc. to report these things. Whatever your feelings on the Guardian and it's left wing bias, it has been better than any other newspaper with investigative journalism and has been willing to publish stuff about phone hacking, from Wikileaks and from Edward Snowden that I think other newspapers are too scared too. And Channel 4 goes to show the advantage of having a broadcaster whose funding doesn't rely on the state, as much as I love the BBC I do think if the started reporting too much that the government didn't like they'd be abolished, so there is an incentive for them to stay in line unfortunately.

Thirdly I think we all as citizens need to spread the word about this, make it clear to the government and to each other that we don't find this sort of thing acceptable and that things need to change.

Lastly, and this could be naive, I think that as long as we have the chain above, someone brave enough to leak information, reporters brave enough to to report it, and people willing to demand change, the politicians will eventually have to listen. Having a voting system that didn't favor the same two parties would help, but even with the voting system eventually a party will come up that will pledge to turn back the tide, the other parties will start losing votes to it, and will have to change.

What I don't see is any leadership coming from politicians in this though. They will continue to try and cover up these things, attack those who leak them and those who report those leaks, and ignore those who demand change. We the people will be the leaders, the politicians will eventually follow public opinion. Sadly that's the way things work in this country, our politicians are not progressive leaders of change but reactive followers of public opinion.",0,1384988993,null,0,1384989189,0,cdj6idh,t3_1r2ws8,t1_cdj6idh,t1_cdj1wzi,null,1428575772,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

true,finlay_mcwalter,null,null,"Everyone is using that word ""hate"", but meaning something utterly unlike what the word really means, what people in the rest of the world take it to mean, and I think what the OP is really asking.

When people are saying ""hate"" and ""despise"", they're really being comically hyperbolic, and really mean ""make gentle fun in the pub, but only if the person is okay about it and makes fun back at me at least as much"".

So (here and elsewhere) when someone *writes* ""I hate Welsh people"" they really mean ""if I meet a Welsh guy down the pub, I'll say what I think are funny things about the poor performance of the Welsh rugby team, a bad pie I had once in Cardiff, and how I once didn't understand something the lady in the DVLA in Swansea said over the phone"".  That, overwhelmingly, is what ""hate"" means in Britain. 

What we forget, because our society is just so fucking *decent*, is what hate means in other countries.  Where it means ""I wouldn't talk to"", ""I wouldn't let my children marry"", or ""I wouldn't do business with"". There's plenty of countries where different groups would actively kill or drive from the neighbourhood someone from a competing group, where someone could go their whole life living a mile from people of another confession and never talk to them, deal with them, even be in the same place as them.

So here's the real truth, the repressed undercurrent in all the ""hate"". We actually, if we were forced to admit it, really really like one another. We really like going to other parts of the UK and feeling that we've travelled but that we still belong. Take a random person from Nairn or Hartlepool or Newtonstewart or Slough or Llanelli, drop them in a pub hundreds of miles from home with a couple of tenners in their pocket, and if you come back in a couple of hours they've got a table full of friends (all making fun of their accent).

I will assume you are completely new to this area - apologies if this is incorrect. The problem with a CFD provider for a complete newbie is that they offer you 'leverage'. Without going into details (as I can't stay long - Wikipedia explains things), this means that you can actually lose more money than you put in.  I hope this is ringing alarm bells for you. You don't want to enter this thinking your £100 is disposable and you don't mind losing it, only to find you owe even more than that.  
  
That leaves you looking for a real stock broker. The problem is, you will be charged for every trade you make. Looking at my broker, they currently have an offer on for £2 trades. On your £100, that's 2%, which is huge. Outside of this offer, it costs £10 (a whopping 10% of your cash).
  
Say you buy £98 worth of shares (with £2 fee on top). You'll need them to rise in value by 2.04% just to get back to your starting value of £100. I hope you can see you that your transaction costs are going to impair you.    
  
My recommendation for now is to save up some money, so that transaction costs comprise a lower percentage of what you are trading. In the meantime, you can look for somewhere that will let you trade with pretend money. I'm afraid I don't have any recommendations on where that would be though.

I found this out when asking my Biology when I feel the need to rip my shirt or Jacket off in excitement after a successful hunt (Austrian farmer). It is a desire to show Male dominance through the chest, mush like Gorillas and the beating of their chest. Many primates do this as it exposes all our most vulnerable parts (throat, gut and chest), thus showing we don't give a shit because we are the alpha male and nothing can touch us.

We also start to breath in heavily through our nostrils before a fight or fight like situation (even just pumped up for a free kick), this is louder and shows our aggression with more effect.

Every single thing we Humans do comes down to the fact that we are animals and this ""random"" stuff we do once upon a time was put to good use!

Answer to my question when I asked them how much it would be:

&gt; EUR Priority Payment
&gt; 
&gt; A Priority Payment is the fastest method of making an international payment. Our charge for this service is £25.00 (payment within HSBC Group is £10.00) and the payment will take up to two working days to credit the beneficiary account.
&gt; 
&gt; SEPA (Single European Payments Area)
&gt; 
&gt; This allows customers to send funds in EUR up to a value of EUR 50000 to the member states of the EU/EEA and Switzerland (excluding UK offshore).
&gt; 
&gt; Our charge for this service is £4.00 and the payment will arrive with the beneficiary bank the following working day if your instruction is taken before 16:30 on a working day.
&gt; 
&gt; When sending an International Payment there is a possibility that the beneficiary bank and/or an intermediary bank may charge for handling the funds. 
&gt; 
&gt; International Bankers draft 
&gt; 
&gt; An International Draft is a guaranteed cheque drawn on a bank abroad. We send the cheques by post to your home address.
&gt; 
&gt; Our charges for drafts are:
&gt; 
&gt; - draft value up to £100: charge of £15.00
&gt; - draft value over £100: charge of £20.00

For me Great Britain is interesting because of it's political structure and everything because it's kinda unique in the world, pretty interesting is also the difference between the City of London and London which the same channel did a video on too. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrObZ_HZZUc",0,1384994754,null,0,1384995129,0,cdj8z1o,t3_1r2ywk,t1_cdj8z1o,t1_cdj4ejf,null,1428574552,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

2. Same Scottish king begins the Ulster Plantations and a starts what is a slow motion attempted genocide of the Irish. The Irish will forever blame the English for this and view the Scots as a fellow oppressed peoples.
3. Scotland bankrupts itself attempting to build an empire and England bails them out and takes on their debts. Britain is formed.
4. History gives us an image of bloodthirsty Englishmen when in fact Scots were very over-represented in colonial and military forces 
5. Due to their better universities Scots filled many of the best jobs in England and the concept of a Scottish merchant became a bit of a stereotype (like an Asian corner shop) they also continue to be over represented in government.
6. As democracy begins to trickle in to Britain and the English start having more of a say over the union due to their greater numbers Scottish independence starts grows beyond being a fringe issue now they don't have as much control
7. They're still over represented in parliament near a third of the last 30 Prime Ministers being Scots (if it was based on population it should have been less than 3).

Now they're having an independence vote that no-one south of the border really cares about.

Now investing 101 says you want to have a diversified portfolio. So really you want to purchase multiple different stocks. Say you were to buy 5 different ones, your transaction fees are now 5 x £2 = £10, leaving only £90 of your £100 to split up across your 5 stocks.  
  
These charges are typically going to be fixed, regardless of whether I make a £10 trade, or a £10000 trade, which is why I recommended saving up more than £100 to work with. A £2 transaction fee on £1000, for example, is only 0.2%.

true,sappy16,null,null,"I'm pretty good at them. I would wager that a large part of the reason is that I read a lot as a kid, and continue to do so now when I get the chance.

There are a few things you need to remember when you do a VR test.

First, forget everything you know (ok, not literally). When the question asks you to identify whether a statement is true, false or 'cannot tell' when held up against the supplied passage, you need to rely *entirely* on what the passage tells you, and not your own knowledge. So even if the statement they are asking about is something really obvious (like 'true/false/can't tell: the eagle is a type of bird'), unless the fact that an eagle is indeed a type of bird is **clearly indicated** by the text they have given you, the answer is 'cannot tell'.  I think this is where many people trip up.

Similarly, they might give you a figure in the passage such as ""50% of the country's immigrants in 2011 were of Chinese descent"" and then have a corresponding statement for you to decide upon like ""In 2011, most of the immigrants to the country were from China"". Yes, logically you might say that the other 50% will almost certainly come from more than one country, and therefore the Chinese are probably the majority, but since 50% is in itself not a majority, and it is not impossible that *all* of the other 50% of immigrants are from Canada, the answer is 'cannot tell'.

Second, paraphrasing. The statements you are given to compare with the main bit of text are usually just lines that have been paraphrased. This is equally the case with statements for which the answer is 'false', they have just used the opposite form. As a (very) elementary example, if there is a line of text in the paragraph that says ""a survey of 1500 Canadians found that 10% drove blue automobiles"", and a corresponding statement ""150 of the surveyed citizens of Canada were drivers of blue vehicles"", they have just reworded the passage, and given you a bit of basic maths to perform. The statement is still true. Equally, the statement may read ""200 of the surveyed citizens of Canada were drivers of blue vehicles"", in which case as long as your maths is ok, you would answer false. No doubt you know that 'Canadians' is pretty much interchangable with 'citizens of Canada', and that 'blue vehicles' is (arguably) the same thing as 'blue automobiles', but sometimes the word substitutions won't be so obvious, and this is where a large vocabulary will come in useful. If your vocabulary is below par, do what you can to improve it. Read a lot, from all kinds of source material. If you come across a word you don't know, look it up. Find out its origin and try to make connections with other words from the same root.

Third, don't rush so much that you make silly mistakes. Often the tests are timed and sometimes performing them slowly will count against you, but it is better to get 10 correct answers in 20 seconds each than 10 wrong ones in 5 seconds each. Find the line in the passage that corresponds to the statement you have been given. **Generally speaking**, if their meanings match up, the answer is true; If the line in the paragraph opposes the statement, the answer is false; If you can't find the right bit at all, the answer is probably 'cannot tell'. Check the line against the statement in the question to confirm your answer. If you aren't sure, re-read the paragraph until you know the answer or until you are fairly certain you won't figure it out without wasting a lot of time (if this is the case, make the best guess you can and move on). 

You **won't** be expected to get them all right - they are designed to sort the best candidates from the slightly less good ones - a test where most people score 90%+ won't help recruiters achieve this. Often (depending on the test), you won't even be expected to finish all the questions.

The TARDIS can't go through universes with ease as seen in the Doctor Donna episode.  Gallifrey is time locked which is why this one is inaccessible but in an alternate universe the time lords could be different entirely. 

I guess it could be a pocket in the sense that its easier to leave then enter but that wouldnt explain the time war and why the Daleks had difficulty traveling between universes as well in the giant orb episode (The Genesis Arc?).
