As a teenager, I used to stay up late watching reruns of UK crime shows like Touch of Frost, Inspector Morse, etc. I really liked how they were more nuanced/ambiguous compared to American punch-em-up cop shows. Often the episode of a UK mystery would end without any big resolution and a fair amount of moral ambiguity. I think some US police shows have got better in that respect, especially The Wire but to a lesser degree some other ones..

These days, I still watch at least some UK shows. There are a lot of really great ones which are more cutting edge in a lot of respects than American/Canadian shows.

true,LordBlackmore,null,null,"One of the biggest draws for me is that British culture, customs and to a degree, daily life are different from here in the U.S.  So when I watch, say a cop drama, which may have more or less the same kind of story as a U.S. drama, lots of things are different, which makes it far more engaging. For this reason, I had a brief fling with Eastenders, which is soap opera to be sure, but it was regular people living more or less regular lives (sort of). 

Another aspect is that dramas tend to have a lot fewer episodes, so quality remains high and they don't have to resort to dumb plot twists
or filler stuff to make more episodes. 

I like a lot of different kinds of British TV, including documentaries, quiz shows like QI, dramas and whatever catches my fancy. I have all of the television network apps on my iPad, so there's always something to watch. That said, I watch more BBC because I like the programming better.

When they revert to talking like that, they are no longer trying to convince *you* of anything; they are trying to keep themselves convinced.

I've come to learn that many of these people constantly question their faith, and the only reason they don't give up altogether is because they don't believe in their ability to form a moral code of their own. They think if they lost their faith, they'd go off the deep end and do nothing but sinful things.

&gt;contamination through disposal of waste water

Dealt with by the EA, there is existing legislation and equipment in place to deal with disposing of waste water. 

&gt;fissures appearing in unexpected places,

As have been stated in the multiple studies, fracture propagation is not a problem in the UK, the geology is different from the US, the aquifers are hundreds of metres above the fracking zone and the internal pressures won't allow anything to flow into the aquifers anyway. 

&gt;incompetence

True. But that is what inspections, regulations, HAZOPs etc. are for.

&gt;crashed tanker carrying chemicals

Has nothing to do with fracking. There are thousands of tankers carrying much more dangerous stuff around than HCL, polyacrylamide or biocides.

&gt;well must stop anything nasty escaping forever

No it doesn't. It has to stop fluid leaking into the ground when fracking is taking place (two to three days). Ideally it shouldn't leak gas but if it does it's a minor problem (methane is non-toxic) and it will be shut down for repairs.

&gt;air will be contaminated through burns now not in the middle of the desert, nor at sea, but in the collective backgarden

These ""burns"" are called [flaring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_flare), it gives off CO2 and H2O. If not done properly there is potential for small amounts of CO production and CH4 escaping but these are once again covered under existing regulations. Flaring is a standard industrial process and is done wherever there are hydrocarbons or flammable subtances present in a plant. 

If you visit Humberside, or Port Talbot or Grangemouth there are plenty of flares lit. It is a non-issue.

* NHS workers have a duty **not** to attend work if they become ill, more so than other jobs because it could be a risk to patients who have a compromised immune system (...like those in a hospital). So they may have a lower threshold for calling in sick. I expect they're probably more likely to go into work with something obviously unlikely to be infectious like a headache, and less likely to go in with something like the shits... and infact even walking into a hospital with a dodgy stomach is absolutely Verboden in the culture of the NHS.

* NHS workers are in a fairly dangerous environment where they are more likely to become ill if their immune system gets run down - making them more likely to take sick days. Having worked in a hospital I can tell you first hand that if you don't look after yourself you get ill constantly.

* Working in healthcare is notoriously stressful - and that in itself is more likely to make you ill.

* Those of you that haven't worked in it may not realise, but the NHS ain't like Tesco, you can't just pop up to Babs in HR and book Wednesday off.... A lot of clinical staff are **not allowed** to choose the dates of most of their annual leave, instead it is allocated to them as part of a rota... (this is more the case in a hospital than a GP) -- it might incline people to pull sickies since they have no other mechanism to get time off at short notice.

The take home message is that a lot of clinical staff subsidise the NHS with their own health and time, many of them for very little money.

Illness doesn't really work that way - you're exposed to it all the time and it is the health of your immune system that protects you. People tend to get ill because

* They haven't encountered a particular pathogen before (i.e. chickenpox, or the common cold which mutates very frequently)

* Their immune system becomes compromised, which allows them to become infected with things they ought to protected from by their own immunity. I'm sure we've all been in that position where we've got a bit stressed, maybe had exams, not eaten very well or done much exerecise and BOOM - next thing you know you've got a raging sore throat.

In many respects, the cardiac surgeon or oncologist are more likely to be in danger because they work in the hospital enviornment where becoming slightly run down could predispose them to far more dangerous infections that they would not encounter in the community. They are also working with patients who **cannot** be allowed to come into contact with even the slightest illness - because those patients themselves are immune supressed by virtue of being ill, or in the case of the oncologist because they are recieving immunosupressants like chemotherapy!",0,1374612030,null,0,1374612266,0,cb8rvy4,t3_1iwc5m,t1_cb8rvy4,t1_cb8p91h,null,1430362260,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Yes, I should do this. I will do this. Thank you. 

&gt;I know a woman who got drugged in Barcelona in a nice part of it and a few people in the UK too, so don't take it for granted.

I don't ever take safety for granted in Paris, don't worry. This is why I always go back to the same hotel every single time. It's a 30 second walk from the metro in a pretty posh area, the square is well lit and always full of locals until 3/4am, the bar/bistro next door is good for drinks until 2/3am and the owner is a really switched on woman who looks after the hotel's guests, and if I want to eat really well, there are two amazing restaurants within a minute or two.  I'm also quite familiar with the easiest ways to get mugged and where that happens; I don't dress like a tourist, I dress exactly as I would in London, and I never stop in the street to look at a map/get my phone out if I know that people can see me. My pre-trip planning is quite fastidious so that I don't get too lost and have to ask strangers for directions. That said, my sense of direction is bloody awful, but if I do get lost, I'm happy to go with the flow and just wander around whatever looks interesting when I'm lost. 

So, thanks for your concern lovely but I've done Paris probably six times on my own and I live in London so I know how to avoid the scum now (as best you can, but you can't stop the occasional freak from spitting in your face and suchlike). 

Actually, I did get mildly caught out on my last visit. I stopped to get some water from a vending machine on the metro and a bunch of kids (aged about 11) pressed the change return button and ran off with my money before I knew what was happening.

The challenge of filtering is different from indexing; the game is to see if something is porn according to an abstract set of rules. You can't do that with a machine so the filter will require an army of people evaluating content (like the IWF does now). Given humans are fallible, mistakes will be made.

It's clear that the filter won't be acceptable because the government will in charge of deciding what gets blocked. It presents a real risk to people who produce content that might be miscategorised and that risk outweighs the ""benefits"".

If people have a genuine need for a filter they should be responsible for installing one, via their router if they're particularly paranoid; it's not an acceptable option as it's forcing the bill for managing it onto everyone, regardless of if they're paranoid or not. In any case, it doesn't matter how acceptable the installation is (which it isn't).

Do you really just go from one capital city in western Europe to another? Have you ever been to Asia or South America or Oceania or the middle east? GWNU I am disappoint.

I don't find your disappointment especially disappointing. I have lots of places that I'd like to visit. Iceland, Japan and New Zealand currently top the list, Thailand is on there but a bit lower, the Middle East, not so much, I have a friend who lives in Dubai who travels around those parts lots and he's always bitching about their draconian laws: also, HEAT. 

But understand that travelling as a single woman differs an awful lot. There's a lot of predatory shites out there, and for now, I go where I feel most safe. I stayed at a different hotel with a friend a year or two ago near Gare du Nord and it was seedy and nasty; if he hadn't been there I'd have felt extremely uncomfortable getting myself home safely, and even in his company I still felt quite uncomfortable going home at night. Also, the entire area stunk of wee.  Trips to Berlin and Iceland could happen next year, but I’m not slumming it, damn it. 

&gt;I hope you told them to ""Ta merde"" or whatever it is.

Disingenuous. Aquifers across the entire country are going to be drilled through in an irreversible procedure. 85% of the ""hydraulic fluid"" will remain in the ground.

The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (1974 as amended) means that for most minor offences - anything where you were given a sentence of less than 48 months imprisonment - are considered 'spent' after a period of time, the time period being longer the longer the sentence you were given, up to 7 years.

For a juvenile offence, the time period is half that for an adult, and so unless you were imprisoned for several years and are still in your early 20s, it is almost certainly 'spent'. What 'spent' means in this context is that - except for a limited number of circumstances - like working with children or the disabled, or national security - when someone asks you if you have a criminal record, you can legally say 'no'. In the case of immigration you have to tell them, but unless it forms part of a pattern of undesirability they won't consider it as a factor.

For Soldado, I will give him that he's a good finisher. He makes great runs off the ball, and that's how he scores so many goals for Valencia, a great team.

But from what I've seen, which is a fair amount, his hold up play isn't great. Like, not much of an improvement on Defoe, and his link up isn't as good as Ade's. This is what worries me.

And it's because La Liga is a league which plays more 'open' football than the Premiership. You don't come up against Stoke, Chelsea, or others putting 2 banks of 4, or 10 men behind the ball, squeezing options in attack. Soldado won't have the space to run through the defence that he gets in La Liga, and he won't have the time and space on the ball to forge that run into a chance.

People talk about the 'physicality' of the league, but I don't think that's a huge issue for many players. I think what is meant by that, or rather, misconstrued, is that PL football is tighter, there's less space, and more aggressive defenders, with teams dropping deeper than usual. For someone with the technical ability of Aguero, that can be fine, but I don't think Soldado can match that level.

Bah, idk, I suppose it's a bit harsh to say this but people make themselves victims by not reading up before they travel. Yes, there's something to be said for being naive ('would you carry my teddy to my girlfriend who will be on the arrivals gate?') but also: don't be so bloody ignorant. If you have a modicum of common sense and are travelling abroad and know how to use the internet, you really should wise yourself up to such scams in advance. People bitching left, right and centre about extremely unfriendly Parisians really piss me off, because they're usually the ones who show up and don't bother to try to speak the language. I've had nothing but good experiences as a rule. If I take myself out for dinner I go with several language/guidebooks and at least try to order in French when the waiter comes. By making an effort, they're usually kind enough to then break out their near-perfect English and explain that I'm trying to order a pig's trotter with pineapple jus and is that really what Madam would like? Where I stay is probably quite snobby, but you really can just win their hearts by making a bit of an effort.

Personally, I enjoy the high production value of American dramas like Mad Men more than I do the British ones (I've never been able to get into Doctor Who).  But I prefer Britain's style of sitcom, and I love the panel shows like QI.  Also, even though we have The Daily Show, I don't think America's corporate-dominated culture would ever allow for something like Charlie Brooker; Britain is much more tolerant of subversive content.  America grudgingly tolerates being laughed at, but seriously criticize it and the powers that be will crush you.  

Like others have said, British television has a history of being publicly funded and therefore the culture of intellectual content is much more entrenched.

Anyway, I have two main gripes with this episode:

1. Arresting Luther for the murder felt a bit silly.  If they'd spoken to the police officers that responded to the hanging (which they must have to find Luther) they would have known that Luther kept the victim alive and was only just out of their sight when the gun-shot was heard.  In addition, they have Ripley on tape backing up Luther, Luther had no motive - certainly no more than he'd ever had.

2. Alice was the hero of the episode.  While cool, I would have liked Luther to play at least some of the hero part too.  In fact, he made some school-boy mistakes like leaving the location of Mary on his phone when going unarmed against a man with a gun that *stole his last phone* the last time they met.

I think the writers got a bit carried away with trying to make good drama and lost their way a bit.  A rare blip, but a shame to end on one.

Donna knows she's part of a system that condones slavery (literally), sweat shop labor, and all kinds of other horrible things, but the Doctor was sort of holding Donna responsible for the actions of the whole human race, which is why she said he was taking ""cheap shots"".

I could ask you (and myself) right now: Are you wearing clothes made by sweat shop workers? I wouldn't be surprised.

But then, how much to blame are we, for being complicit in the system of oppression? What can we do about it? Are we more to blame for not speaking up? Should we boycott the company that condones sweat shop labor? (it probably won't have any effect and if you boycott all the companies that do shit things, good luck buying *anything* - think about the Monsanto-Unilever-Dove/Axe connections).

So just those really basic questions raise a lot of issues...and Donna called it a ""cheap shot"" because the Doctor seemed to be (from her POV) holding her accountable for this complex and horrible problem the entire human race suffers from (and I didn't even use the word ""colonialism"" in this).",0,1374618953,null,0,false,0,cb8ujxc,t3_1iwsga,t1_cb8ujxc,t3_1iwsga,null,1430361004,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

Sexual frustration isn't an excuse for any form of behaviour - but it does act as a catalyst for violence (both sexual and physical) against women (and even other men).

Some men there will literally walk up to a woman in a secluded place and squeeze her breasts, then run off.

Sexually naive is the only way I can really describe it.

For that same reason, a random file *and* a bunch of encryption tools means that it's very likely the file is encrypted. If it were compressed, it would almost certainly have headers and otherwise be possible to decompress (doing so would be a sensible way to show it wasn't encrypted...)

If it's a *file* (as opposed to a partition) then the onus would  be on the defendant to plausible explain it as something other than encrypted. A partition could be justified as being wiped by certain secure programs, but only if there's no boot loader or other clear reference to it.

i'm baffled by this 'confusion' over the contract, if TB has his facts straight. presumably there is a chance Pere could challenge LFC over the contract, but if he's wrong and the club are right he's probably breaking some rules somewhere. likewise if LFC have accidentally put a £40m release clause in they're therefore acting illegally by rejecting the bid.

There were people that had it, and there were even a few [expletive] people that went around trying to spoil the plot of the episode to people. Most people, though, most likely didn't have the capability to burn a Blu-ray player, or the knowledge to host a torrent file. The few that might have would still probably refrain since it wouldn't be too hard to track down the person who leaked the finale(I think after everything was said and done, only like a couple hundred were leaked, and of those, apparently a lot of people got direct calls from BBC asking them not to leak the episode).

In case you still don't believe me, here's a private message I received the Tuesday before the finale from someone trying to spoil the episode for me:

So assuming they actually do have this 70mil that they say i really hope they cant bid any higher than that because they need the money for other areas, they definitely need a CB, koscielny is good but vermaelen was terrible last year and mertesacker was laughable at times.

Lawful authority is only granted to bodies such as the Police, and would never cover a member of the general public. Tasers should therefore not be used or in the possession of any member of the public.

Do check [Trip Advisor](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/) for people's opinions too.

As mentioned elsewhere in the thread, always bear in mind that the closer to a Motorway something is, the more expensive it is.
e.g. if a smoker, a packet of cigarettes (aka cigs, ciggies, fags) which cost about £7.00 can easily be £9.00 at a Motorway service station.
Fuel is similarly hiked up, as are lodgings, coffee, bottled water, burgers, sandwiches, etc.

Cities - I'd be remiss if I didn't mention my own home city, Liverpool. Two cathedrals, quite different in their respective architectures, The [Anglican Cathedral](http://www.liverpoolcathedral.org.uk/) is the more traditional, and the [Metropolitan Cathedral](http://www.liverpoolmetrocathedral.org.uk/) which was built in the 1960s. Locally it's known as ""Paddy's Wigwam"". There are also [ferries across the Mersey](http://www.merseyferries.co.uk/) (usually including the song of the same name during the tour, unless the guides have gone particularly crazy that day from the constant loop), a lot of Beatles related stuff, various art galleries such as the [Lady Lever Art Gallery](http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ladylever/) and the [Tate Gallery](http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-liverpool), and [several museums](http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/).

You asked about festivals - there is a good festival at the very end of the time you specified - [Festival Number 6](http://www.festivalnumber6.com/), 13th, 14th and 15th September, set in the North-West-Welsh village of Portmeirion (where the original, 1960s version of The Prisoner was filmed).

While it's quite a detour from your more eastern-sided route down the country, Wales is a beautiful place and there's lots of villages, forests, castles, hills, lakes and lovely people.
Also in Wales is Lake Bala, and the lovely little [Betws-y-Coed](http://www.betws-y-coed.co.uk/)

Wherever you drive in the UK, don't forget that we **DON'T** have that turning at a red-light thing. Red light means stop, period. Although sometimes there are filter lights.

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"I think the general consensus is that he's a great striker who really didn't fit our style of play under Mancini. We played a very conservative possession game, and he had a hard time contributing to the lead up play, as passing and creativity are not his strong points. Because of that, we mostly brought him on to change the game up when our preferred strategy wasn't working, and on several occasions he had great performances from the bench, although his reputation as a super sub is often overstated; he scored most of his goals in games he started. 

It remains to be seen whether he will fit better with Pellegrini's style, but it's worth mentioning that we've brought in Negredo, who plays a similar game, so it could be that we will be playing more to the strengths of this kind of player. Also, Pellegrini has been adamant that we'll be keeping Dzeko this year, and presumably he has a reason for wanting to keep him, so I'm hopeful that we'll see good things from him this year.

Personally I like a bit of creativity in my forwards, but Aguero and Jovetic more than make up for any lack of creativity that Dzeko and Negredo may suffer from, and with this combination of strikers, I expect us to score a lot next year, especially being fed by Silva, Navas, Yaya, Fernandinho, and Nasri, who I think Pellegrini will be able to get some good form out of. 

But it's not like Dzeko's entirely free of blame for his underperforming. Dzeko's been a bit hit or miss with us in the past, sometimes he's been great, but he's been inconsistent, at times wildly so. His positioning is great, and he's got a good boot when he manages to make good contact, but these qualities are sometimes undermined by a poor first touch and the fact that he's often not clinical enough to make anything of the chances he finds himself in relatively often. Sometimes these aren't issues at all and he seems to score at will, sometimes they make him functionally useless, but we should start playing a game that's more to his liking soon, and I think he'll step up to the plate.",0,1374628778,null,0,1374686601,0,cb8xz97,t3_1ixahw,t1_cb8xz97,t3_1ixahw,null,1430359281,9,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,9

Does nobody think that if Arsenal spend that kind of money on Suarez they are helping us IMO.

Firstly they get a brilliant player in Suarez but not 55 million good. Because based on his history they will most likely be missing him for about 1/5 to 1/4 of the season. He arguably did so well for us last season because he was the only senior striker so everything revolved around him and went through him. I cant see him replicating that with Arsenal and I don't see him doing the same as last year for us this year because not everything will go through him too the same extent as last year. We are not as weak up front.

We get 55 million from them that will be invested back into the team. That along with the money we are looking to spend right now( 20 odd million if the Mkhitaryan is anything to go by). I think that we have proved we wont overspend, we can find bargains and we can find quality players. 

This means one of our biggest rivals has just spent all there transfer money on one player who may miss a chunk of a season each year. If they dont get Luis they will still be looking to spend that money elsewhere so they will still improve. 

I think Luis was so good last year because the rest of the attacking line was so weak. This has led to him being overvalued and I don't see it as the worst thing that could happen if he ends up at Arsenal for a crazy sum like 55 million.

First point has nothing to do with fracking, I am not arguing about transportation.

It may be majority farmland but it is privately owned land, if the owners want to allow their land to be used for fracking that is up to them.

&gt;Aquifers across the entire country are going to be drilled through in an irreversible procedure. 85% of the ""hydraulic fluid"" will remain in the ground. 

Yes they will, but that is of no problem with the strict controls on drilling and well design. The EA has this to say on the matter.

&gt;If hydraulic fracturing takes place
in
a borehole that passes
through groundwater we
would
regard
the
fracturing
as a groundwater activity.
A permit
under EPR
will not be required as long as
we are satisfied
that
groundwater is protected by
the controls applied by the MPA
, the HSE and through the notice to drill
under the WRA 1991.
Should we believe groundwater
to be
at risk we may
use a notice either
to
require
that a permit be obtained, which would include the appropriate measures designed to minimise any
impact
or risk, or if necessary to prohibit the activity altogether

&gt;Only substances
that have been
assessed as being non-hazardous pollutants under the Groundwater
Daughter Directive
may
be used
in hydraulic fracturing fluids
.
Information on the chemicals used by an
operator
in hydraulic fracturing fluid
will normally be made available to the public.
We
may
not disclose the
relative quantities in the mixture, as this is commercially confidential.

&gt;The borehole
must
be decommissioned through sealing and/or backfilling to protect groundwater and
surface waters.

As the EA has stated, if there is an unacceptable risk fracking will not be allowed. 

I don't understand what you're getting at by referring to it as an ""irreversible procedure"", the borehole will be sealed once production has finished.

Any additives are non-hazardous to water supplies anyway, there are only three additional chemicals that have currently been permitted by the EA.

&gt;In the UK, the EA have set out that the only additives that will be permitted are polycrylamide, hydrochloric acid and a biocide.

I will once again point to the[ Royal Society](http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/shale-gas-extraction/report/) report on fracking, specifically its findings on water contamination.

&gt;Well integrity is the highest priority. More likely causes of possible contamination include faulty wells. The UK’s unique well examination scheme was set up so that independent, specialist experts could review the design of every offshore well. This scheme must be made fit for purpose for onshore activities.

As you can see any contamination will likely be from poorly made wells. Thanks to our offshore gas industry we already have a mature agency that inspects and regulates well integrity. 

Your claim that 85 per cent of fluid remains in the ground is wrong. I'm not going to explain the engineering behind it because I haven't got the time to walk you through a geology and chem eng course. But the amount of fluid left behind is ideally between 40 and 60 percent. Anymore than 75 per cent will severely reduce the efficiency of the frack and resulting gas production. What stays behind is the proppant, usually grains of sand, which keep the fractures open for the gas to flow out of.

&gt;Each horizontal bore is fracked numerous times moving back towards the source. Each well is horizontally bored numerous times. ""Two to three days"" is spin.

Each bore is fracked once, it's in stages but it is fracked once. Each bore only goes in one direction, there can be multiple bored on the same pad but the actual borehole only goes horizontal in one direction. It can take up to 4 hours to frack a stage and there can be up to 100 stages, though 30 to 40 is more common.

&gt;More pollution is more pollution and we are talking hundreds if not thousands of new flares near populations. Ozone build-up is going to happen.

Flares make CO2 and are only used in start up, shut down, process changes or in an emergency. They are not flaring all the time. 

Because you don't understand what a shill is I'll quote the wiki definition.

Next season, if he does more of the same, he'll be gone but he'll be way more 'established.' 

Let's be honest, between those Inter games and Christmas this season, Bale was good but he wasn't 'one of the best in the world' good. The media hyped him so much, that whenever he wasn't dominating every match he was in, he was a disappointment. He's definitely the best player in the league right now though.

It's sad that we have to accept that he'll leave, but it's far better than him flopping outright. We'll make money off him, but we're in a position now where we don't have to cave in at the first go. He's not gonna pull a Modric/Berbs/Carrick on us, partly because he's such a down to earth lad and also because we have such an incredible squad.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has refuted the suggestion he is playing mind games with Man United counterpart David Moyes.

 David Moyes: Will come up against Jose Mourinho again this season
David Moyes: Will come up against Jose Mourinho again this season
It was put to Mourinho on his arrival in Jakarta, where Chelsea on Thursday play an All-Star XI, that his compliments towards Moyes were a calculated act designed to destabilise the Barclays Premier League champions.

Mourinho's sole remaining transfer target is a Manchester United player and Chelsea last week had a bid for Wayne Rooney rejected by United, who say the striker is not for sale.

Mourinho said: ""If to say that my colleague in Man United is a great coach, he deserves success, he deserves time to work, he didn't win trophies at Everton because it's difficult to win trophies there... If to speak good about him is to play mind games, what do you say if I speak bad about him?

""The best thing is not to speak, and if I don't speak nobody says nothing.""

Like Moyes, Mourinho believes it is better to sign players early in the transfer window.

But, unlike United, Chelsea have already recruited Andre Schurrle, Marco van Ginkel and Mark Schwarzer this summer.

""He's right,"" Mourinho said. ""The sooner you have the players, the better.

""You know the squad you have, you know what you have to work with, you have time for that.""

The Portuguese warned Chelsea's Premier League rivals of the dangers of doing late business in the transfer window, which this season closes on September 2.

""Many clubs are waiting to the last moment to make their decisions,"" Mourinho said. ""The problem is that those decisions affect not just one or two clubs, but a lot of them.

""The one who sells has to go and buy, then they have to buy to replace, so no club is safe.

""Until the last minute somebody can go there and steal a player. I don't mean steal a player, but steal the balance that a manager has when he's working with a team.

""In that aspect, we are lucky because we don't have players to sell, so none of my players is leaving under any circumstances.

""That's good for me, but many teams will be until the last moment under pressure, without knowing how the squad is going to be.""",0,1374635953,null,0,false,0,cb90lfn,t3_1ixkh7,t1_cb90lfn,t3_1ixkh7,null,1430358048,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Therefore, the difference between 45 and 55 is negligible because it is unlikely to result in us getting a superior player. We're more likely to just have extra money to fill out the squad. Which is great, but doesn't solve losing him.

We can do just as much with 45 as with 55 is my point. 

But if we sell to Arsenal we're strengthening one of our main rivals for 4th. It doesn't make any sense at all for us and is actually incredibly intelligent for Arsenal. Not just in that they'd get an incredible player, but they'd be hurting a team prepared to rival them. 

For Arsenal, it makes much more sense to go for Suarez than Higuain because of that. Beyond being the superior player, they hurt a rival. 

Which is the same reason it makes no sense for us and won't happen.

When we sold Torres to Chelsea we were no where near challenging them. It would hurt to see him in England and obviously it would just hurt in general, but it wouldn't mean much for us in terms of where we finish (considering we'd lose him anyway).

Here's the difference; 2 years ago, when Harry let Bale float to the center of the pitch because he was getting marked out of games on the left, it worked for all of 2 games. Last year, when AVB did *exactly* the same thing, letting Bale float into the middle to get him more involved, Bale turned into a goal-scoring machine. And it's not like people forgot about him either, because he did it week in, week out, from January through May. The bottom line is this; The best players in the world, on a weekly basis, do things that make you go ""Well, we did everything we could, but there's just no way we could've stopped *that*.""

Bale does that. And because of that, we need to keep him. Period. We **are** good enough to challenge for the title next year, provided we get in a striker. Man City is good, but they will take time to adjust to Pelligrini &amp; integrate the new signings, just like we did last year. Chelsea are very talented, and Mourinho is a great coach... but if anyone can take Mourinho apart, it's AVB. Man Utd will be in the mix, but I don't really believe Moyes will figure things out fast enough to have them in the race for the title, not with the rough start they have. And Woolwich have only signed a U-21 striker to strengthen their squad. 

I truly believe that if we can stay healthy and start this year off right, we can challenge for the title, and if we do, and make the CL, why wouldn't Bale want to stay?

It seems like he assumed the bid would be accepted, which is obviously not the case. Now it seems he MIGHT have some inside info, or lucky guess...who knows...however, until either club confirms anything on their official page, I'm not going to believe some unknown Twitter account.

Purely as a fan, I might because I really enjoy watching him play, but thinking about it from a club perspective, I think I'd take the 4 players, because I really think it would make us an even more formidable team.

true,fookhar,null,null,"You are being disingenuous or ignorant about several of your claims. For instance you imply that The Pirate Bay was blocked because it might contain child porn, that is outright false, since it was blocked because it gives access copyright infringing material. Secondly, you imply that Denmark creating the child porn filter was a slippery slope which ended in the blocking of other sites later. That is unfounded, as the requirements to block child porn sites and other sites are very different. The police and TDC manages the child porn filter and they can add sites without a preliminary injunction, but if you want to block a site which infringes on your copyright, you do need a preliminary injunction.

Also, the accident you're talking about clearly was an accident, the filter is not being used to purposely block sites without child porn. And no laws or regulations were changed to suddenly make it legal to block copyright infringing sites. You're making it sound like the Danish government menacingly used the creation of the child porn filter to be able to later filter other sites, but that is completely unfounded, and you have not presented a single piece of evidence which supports that claim.

&gt; If they had started with ""we will implement a blacklist for copyright violation/gambling"" this measure would never have been accepted by the population.

You are once again implying that the filtering of child porn sites and copyright infringing sites happen in the same way, and that's nonsense.

I've always been quite a fan boy of quirky phones running more advanced O/S, previous being the N900 running Maemo, but I got bored of software problems relating to poorly vetted apps and such forth so decided to switch to windows OS.  Didn't stray far from Nokia though as ended up with Lumia 900, but to be fair its been solid.  I use an iPhone 4 for work and hate the fucker.  Terrible battery life and has gradually got slower and slower with each update.  
  

Sure the phone may not have as much memory as S4 etc but its not needed.  The OS is designed to run smoothly with the hardware its got.  Phone is responsive, smooth and easy to use.  

You get built in full sat nav for free which is very handy. Zune is quite simple to use for managing music/files.

You get a fair amount of free storage (25gb) and upgrading is quite cheap too, I'm paying £6 a year for an extra 20gb, £32 a year gets you another 100gb!  Can also access all files on your PC via the skydrive app from your phone which is handy.

Recommend Baconit for Reddit browsing as well!  

Battery saver mode is very handy too, activate and it disables all background updating tasks for when you know you have a long day ahead of you and want to preserve battery etc.  Music playing barely dents the battery though.  3g takes its toll but seems to be quite the norm with smart phones unfortunately.

Only downside is there is still a gap in way of app market in comparison to Android/Crapple.  

I do find the Lumia 900 a little large though, however I have small child hands so for normal person it might be suitable.  The latest offerings (Lumia 925) run windows phone 8 and have quirks such as NFC and wireless charging.  

As usual with Nokia you get a pretty swish camera with their carl zeiss lens.  Personally I think my next phone may be the Lumia 1020 as it has a bat shit crazy camera that would be fun for an amateur shutter bug like myself.

S4 is a good phone though, won't deny that.  Battery life seems good and friends seem very happy with them.  Got a couple of friends with note and they love em too.  

Oh, as for smashing screens, my wife has the Lumia 800 and has managed to break three screens.  No idea how she achieves these things, she is literally the clumsiest person I know, I sometimes fear for leaving my son alone with her.  However, positive is each time I've ordered screen from ebay which comes with digitaliser, touch screen, glass all as one and easily swapped in ten minutes.  All for around £30.  She now has a stupid leather flappy case and touch wood she hasn't broken it yet.

We have a quota system on immigrants with very little flexibility making us one of the hardest countries to immigrate into in the world.

Of course EU citizens can all move here - which is perhaps more worrying given the introduction of poorer Eastern countries into the EU.

This goes to prove that fracking operators are not omniscient and that the British rock formations aren't this ""special case"" immune to failure like you insist on.

&gt; **It does not cover our regulation of commercial production** of shale gas or exploration and production of other types of gas (conventional or unconventional) such as coal bed methane. Neither does it cover our regulation of boreholes for geological sampling.

It seems you have proposed a useless source.

&gt; Information on the chemicals used by an operator in hydraulic fracturing fluid will **normally be** made available to the public. **We may not disclose the relative quantities** in the mixture, as this is commercially confidential.

That's interesting—fracking fluid is judged a trade secret.

&gt; But the amount of fluid left behind is ideally between 40 and 60 percent. Anymore than 75 per cent will severely reduce the efficiency of the frack and resulting gas production.

This sentence...

&gt; What stays behind is the proppant, usually grains of sand, which keep the fractures open for the gas to flow out of.

...competes with this sentence. At least we agree, a majority is left dumped in the ground.

&gt; Flares make CO2 and are only used in start up, shut down, process changes or in an emergency. They are not flaring all the time.

That to me is pretty standard 'go to the media to strengthen negotiation position' tactics. Spurs did the [same thing](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/tottenham-transfer-news-lisandro-lopez-2078923). They say they don't want to sell, we say we don't want to buy. It is how you wrestle the price in your own favour.

So they will negotiate with clubs that will pay the 30m, by there own admission spurs are almost there.

* 3 EPL titles
* 4 FA Cups
* 2 League Cups
* 2 Community Shields
* 1 UEFA CL trophy
* 1 Europa League trophy

In that same period, here is Man Utd's trophy haul:

*  5 EPL titles
* 1 FA Cup
* 3 League Cups
* 5 Community Shields
* 1 UEFA CL trophy
* 1 FIFA Club World Cup

Chelsea's average league position and points tally since Abramovich:

* Average position: 2.3
* Average points tally: 81.2

Man Utd's average league position and points tally in the same period:

* Average position: 1.7
* Average points tally: 84.4

In the UEFA CL I have compared Man Utd and Chelsea as follows:

* 1 point for Winner, 2 points for Finalist, 3.5 for Semi-Finalist, 6.5 for Quarter-Finalist, 12.5 for Round of 16, 24.5 for Group Stages.
* The points indicate the average final ""rank"", if you will, for reaching that stage of the competition, so for instance for Semi-Finalist, you get 3.5 because you're not 3rd, nor are you 4th, since that hasn't been determined, so you get 3.5 points.
* Therefore, the lower the score, the better your showing in the UEFA CL.

Chelsea's and Man Utd's scores since Abramovich took over:

* Chelsea: 7.3
* Man Utd: 10.15

So to conclude:

* Man Utd have a greater trophy haul than us domestically, and have been better in the league.
* The domestic exception to this is the FA Cup where Chelsea have been far superior to Man Utd.
* In terms of league position, Man Utd have a pretty significant advantage over us, although the points tally is a lot closer. It shows that on average, Man Utd only win about 1 more league game than us per season.
* In the UEFA CL, it seems that Chelsea has performed quite a bit better over the past 10 years, with an advantage of almost 3 average ""ranks"" ahead of Man Utd.

Being self employed in the UK for an American should be relatively simple because as far as I know you have to complete your own tax returns every year and are used to keeping records on expenditure and income. If your annual turnover is under £70k in the UK you only need to keep a basic set of accounts and on the self assessment fill in a box for total income and total expenses rather than categorising. One thing to be aware of is your first tax bill. Say for the tax year April 2013-14 you make enough profit to pay tax. In the first year you will pay 150% of the tax due by 31/1/2015 with another 50% payable on account by 31/7/2015. That will then be deducted from your 2014-15 bill but it is something that catches out a lot of newly self employed. The idea in year 1 is not to make a profit on paper high enough to be taxed and then you don't have to pay anything on account.

The sets and staging are pretty poor though, and agree on some of the extraneous characters being pretty pointless.  Why make it look 70s? Why does Eggy exist?

In Arsenal terms: we competed consistently in the last rounds of the CL, finished 2nd in the league 2009.

( we recognise these as achievements but don't celebrate it because we didn't win any trophies for it )

The club is taking time to heal after a bad period in the club's history. 

We hope to build back to a trophy winning team but recognise our position at the moment. 

I think the problem people have with Arsenal is the flaunting of participation in the CL as a triumph.

Its an achievement but hardly something to be so proud of.
( you barely compete in the later rounds of the competition anyway )

Would we be happy with CL qualification this season? Yes.

Would we be happy just qualifying for the CL for the next 5 years? NO

Its all about the ambition to win trophies, even if at times you know its almost impossible in the club's current situation.

That is what Liverpool must always strive for.

That is why we find it difficult when Arsenal fans wave there CL participation around.

A salary of £50k should be enough for a London flat. Combined with your income, even taking in to account the fact you're self employed, you should be able to obtain a mortgage.

Last time I checked gifts won't always attract capital gains tax, but here's the HMRC reference: http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cgt/intro/gifts-inherit-divorce.htm

There are still ways you can obtain a mortgage, even if you're self employed. A friend of mine who is a self employed director at a company was able to complete in a similar situation to you. He said it helps to get a decent IFA and mortgage broker. The IFA would hopefully help with your CGT predicament. If you don't have either, find one at http://www.unbiased.co.uk. Don't forget to shop around!

Going back to whether you would want to go with a joint application or not - bear in mind if the mortgage is only in one person's name, if the other person pays ""rent"", bills, or contributes to the upkeep in any way, I've been told that this often provides enough legal basis to claim part of the estate as their own, should you break up. One way around that would be to make them a tenant, but in the context of relationships, that could be quite hard.

While I'm in a similar situation with regards to buying as I have the deposit and mortgage, I'm not a professional in this area so I'd advise you lawyer up. Good luck.",0,1374662397,null,0,false,0,cb96je0,t3_1iy4pr,t1_cb96je0,t3_1iy4pr,null,1430355175,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

They could either keep him for that year and then almost certainly lose him for nothing, or sell him for a significant figure and improve the overall quality of the team.

Arsenal earned £27m from the most recent CL, whereas Bayern earned £47m, so even if Arsenal had won the CL by keeping RVP, they still would have lost money compared to just selling him. Assuming that they still wouldn't have got that far even with RVP (which I think even most Arsenal fans would probably agree is fair), they wouldn't have any silverware to show for it and yet they'd spent more money than if they'd just sold him.

Was impressed by Allen, Gerrard, and Sterling (seemed to die out in the last 15 minutes). Ibe did a good job in the last 15 minutes in which Sterling seemed to die out.

Thoroughly unimpressed by Henderson, Borini, and Enrique. Hendo and Borini seemed non-existent out there. Henderson is definitely not suited to play behind the striker. He's got a fantastic work rate and is fairly good going up front, but he just lacks that creative ability that Coutinho and Suarez possess---I would even prefer considering Allen over Henderson in the AM position..and Borini...well...he's just...Borini, I guess.
Enrique, I considered, somewhat wasteful in possession and displayed his erratic defensive abilities.

*Also, I personally prefer Wisdom operating as a right back. Seemed uneasy at CB, but that could certainly be just a matter of him getting comfortable with that position.

*Another side note: I was getting really irritated at the mediocre commentators. Just BAD commentary...I was particularly getting upset at how they kept mispronouncing Ibe.

Borini's touch has been poor so far but I think his running has been OK. He has mostly been running into channels to open up space through the middle which actually led to Gerrard's goal.

&gt;I had a £27 grand a year job. I've not been brought up on benefits and a tracksuit watching Jeremy Kyle. I'm a middle class, well educated young woman who fell a bit by the way side. 

In addition to that she's also a rather photogenic and stylish young woman for someone in the grips of poverty, making her perfect material for a Guardian article on being poor (regardless of how representative she is). Their readers can relate to someone like that; someone down on their luck who might otherwise have been one of them. But its quite a distance from what extreme poverty looks like.

I was pressed into helping at a ‘street church’ last Sunday; the Churches of Northampton pool together volunteers, donate food and serve lunch to the people who scrape a living in one of the roughest parts of the town, followed by a motivational talk by an evangelising powerlifting team.

I’d never done anything like this, never really wanted too, but felt too guilty to refuse. The people streaming into the old salvation army center were of the roughest sort you could imagine; malnourished, wrecked by alcohol and drug abuse, dressed in tracksuits and cheap sportswear. They were ugly.

I served them steaming bowls of soup without a word of thanks from any of them; several asked ‘have you only got tomato?’. We also served sandwiches and fairy cakes and tea, then listened to the powerlifters talk about their journey from wasted lives to champion lifters through the power of God (well, a few of them listened).

At the end we wrapped up the leftover sandwiches for ‘take-away’ packs; we ran out rather quickly, and people got irritated and angry that we couldn’t give them anything.

To me this is the real face of extreme poverty in Britain; the ungrateful and the feckless, the dependent and the addicted. It’s ugly and it’s hard to do anything about. But I still rate the people who volunteer in that center every week above guardian writers who campaign against government policy.

**The Good**:

* Allen is playing well. Good circulation of the ball. He's winning back the ball, too. Good to see him regaining a bit of confidence it seems.
* Ibe and Sterling on the wings are impressive. They both are looking incredibly pacy and dangerous. Sterling is looking physically stronger this season.
* I'm liking Wisdom too. He's playing quite aggressively, but he's making plays and regathering well.
* Of course great half from Gerrard. Solid halves from Jones, Johnson, Skrtel too. 

**The Bad**:

* I think Borini looks lost. His movement into the box has been rather lazy at times. A couple of brighter moments in the leadup to the goal, but on the whole, pretty invisible.
* Jose Enrique is playing incredibly arrogantly and getting skinned. Playing poorly in the defensive end and up the pitch too. Hopefully he picks it up.

Hopefully the second half is good and we get to see some more players take the pitch - Come on you Reds! YNWA.

&gt; Yes censoring dissent is very unwelcome. Why should the Internet be censored at all? Should information ever be illegal? 


Information **certainly** should be illegal, for example the violent and sex offenders register contains information protected in the same way as classified information. You have no right to possess this information and by doing so you breech the privacy of other people.


&gt; Why right does anyone have to outlaw my access to information? 


To preserve order, to prevent harm, to enable prompt investigation of crimes. There are many reasons to outlaw access to information. Giving out careful instructions on how to produce biological weapons has no peacetime purpose. Why should you be permitted to have this information?

&gt;In the worst case, the fluid could migrate upwards along a potential fault plane by 2000 ft. Because
of the presence of a very thick impermeable formation overlying the Bowland shale and the Permian
anhydrites that will act as barrier,
there is negligible risk of fluid breaching into permeable layers. 

Summary Page. V

&gt;From the fracture simulations (Stratagen, 2011)
and hydro-mechanical fault injection simulations (Q
-con, 2011), we know that the maximum extent in
the worst case is about 1400 ft. Even with a safety
factor of 50%, this would still fall within the
Millstone Grit formation. So, it can be concluded th
at it is very unlikely that the fluid would ever
leave the Containment Layer.

As you can see thanks to the geology of the rock in this area it is almost impossible for any fluid to reach permeable layers. 

I am talking about the safety of the process not spoiling green belt land. 


&gt;It does not cover our regulation of commercial production of shale gas or exploration and production of other types of gas (conventional or unconventional) such as coal bed methane. Neither does it cover our regulation of boreholes for geological sampling.

I can't find that quote in any of the sources mentioned, can you refer me to which one please.

&gt;That's interesting—fracking fluid is judged a trade secret.

There is a difference between quantities and what is in the fluid. The EA will have the quantities and will be able to make an assesment on the fluid, general layman won't be able to. But quantities of ingredients in foods are not mentioned, or in most products that we use. 

&gt;This is the problem with chemists sometimes, they get lost in the sacredness of their perfect diagrams. Cars also just give of CO2 in perfect combustion and ozone is in no way a problem on still days.

I'm a chemical engineer. Big difference. The whole point of flaring is to stop methane producing ozone. 

&gt;You are dishonest, you tend to only present one side of the debate, you very quickly become demeaning, arrogant and condescending. You white wash a dirty industry. All you can do is point to bits of paper—diagrams. In no way have we proved fracking empirically sound.

I am pointing to the various research papers, independent reviews and other literature on fracking and its effects. You have used one source, which is wikipedia, which uses an anti-fracking group (made up of laymen, not scientists or engineers) that uses cherry picked quotes. Stop pretending I'm the dishonest one, I am using peer reviewed papers and reviews from respected independent organisations, you aren't really sourcing anything at all.

&gt;The very unlikely event of fractures propagating
all the way to overlying aquifers would provide a
possible route for fracture fluids to flow. However,
suitable pressure and permeability conditions would
also be necessary for fluids to flow (Younger 2007).
Sufficiently high upward pressures would be required
during the fracturing process and then sustained
afterwards over the long term once the fracturing
process had ceased. It is very difficult to conceive
of how this might occur given the UK’s shale gas
hydrogeological environments. Even if this were the
case, the permeability of the fractures would still
need to be similar to that of the overlying aquifer
for any significant quantity of fluid to flow. In reality,
the permeability of the aquifer is likely to be several
orders of magnitude greater than the permeability of
the fractures. Upward flow of fluids from the zone of
shale gas extraction to overlying aquifers via fractures
in the intervening strata is highly unlikely.

**Eriksen is very close to Liverpool switch**

By Jonas Fjordside 24 July 2013, 08:19

A long and tenacious transfer saga may soon come to a full stop. Christian Eriksen, according to several independent sources extremely close to a move to England Liverpool.
The Dane had to be agreed with Liverpool about the personal details of a contract. It writes ESPN and Tuttomercato. Talk Sport writes further that teammate in Ajax, Ryan Babel, should have invited Eriksen to switch to the English club that Babel himself has previously appeared for.

This is despite rumors that the Italian AC Milan had come off in the battle for the Dane, but the rumor also seems to be dead now.

Trainer in Ajax, Frank de Boer, has publicly warned Eriksen switch to Liverpool when he did not think Dane style of play suits the English.

Eriksen is expected in any case to leave Ajax this summer, as he has contract expired next year. The Dane has stated that he would like to pay Ajax back by bringing the club a large transfer fee rather than to slip free.",0,1374668014,null,0,false,0,cb97g32,t3_1iy5as,t1_cb97g32,t3_1iy5as,null,1430354747,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

true,Mokoba,null,null,"Most PFI projects aren't fully funded by private finance, some are and they are the most likely to be in trouble, but most are a partnership using public and private money.

The thinking behind it is that if for example the government wants to build new schools and each school costs £50m then why not use a PFI scheme to build twice the number of schools for the initial outlay. The government doesn't have to increase it's budget and the new schools are built with money being paid back to the banks over a long period of time. It's basically like a mortgage with the initial government funding being the deposit.

The other supposed advantage of PFI is that the private company is responsible for the school, hospital or whatever for a set period of time. This means that the private group will be responsible for all maintenance, security and services of the property. It's this additional service that is one of the most attractive points of PFI. Maintaining a building as large as a hospital is a huge cost so having that being paid by a private company allows the NHS trust controlling the hospital to have more money for other hospital costs.

It's usually around the length of the financing which varies but is around 30 years. This might not be true for all PFI project but it was for the ones that I have worked on.

The private part of the PFI is a group of private companies, a bank for the money, engineering and construction companies for the building and management companies for managing the property after it's completed. So it's not just 

PFI is an excellent idea that was abused by the Labour government, they used it to finance projects that weren't needed and for a cost that was far greater than what it would have cost to build it the traditional way. 

Most of the major hospitals in the UK have been rebuilt or had a large amount of renovation and additional work done to them thanks to the PFI scheme, it is projects like that the PFI scheme was developed for and it is working well for them. 

I could go on more but that is basically why PFI was used.

Presumably at the end of it because we know 60% of the fluid remains it becomes more toxific as it mixes with what ever nature saw fit to lock away from the surface. This bore hole presumably is now the line of least resistance for anything of a low viscosity to make its way upwards.

We don't know this yet because at the moment it's CEOP and there's no draft that I know of.

&gt; I was not referring to classified information or information that is already private in nature. I was inarticulate and needlessly vague on this point. 

Ok well lets consider something like child porn or beastiality
* The person / animal involved cannot consent, therefore sharing the picture already entails private information
* The existence of a supply and a demand relationship inherently means that reducing demand also reduces supply

These are both compelling issues to prohibit access to child porn, especially when there exist people that have produced it for profit.

&gt; I'd like to see the studies you reference because most of the ones I have seen seem to contradict David Cameron's position.

I'm not on the same PC at the moment but there is a report from something like the 'Childrens Foundation' which links a buttload of research into sexual habits and youth.

&gt; Neither is the argument that regulation is necessary to enforce your worldview something that is compatible with the essence of a free society even when I do agree with you that gender equality is a noble and important cause. 

Regulation isn't incompatible with the essence of a free society. It is in fact essential. Do you think women should be expected to perform certain sexual acts as part of a relationship?

That really is only because of the *type* of capitalism we have. It's perfectly possible to have more equitable models of resource distribution, but these tend not to work at larger scales. At larger scales, it is often best to have only a handful of actors involved to leverage that power. The same principle that Building Societies and Co-ops use to get the best deals for their customers. The problem is that it's far easier for private investors to put money into something which has the aim of maximising profits rather than minimising customer costs.

They stopped winning trophies when the billions came into Chelsea. There's no coincidence there.

In that time we have won...

A Champions League and an F.A. Cup (also The League Cup).

Arsenal have won the league and also the F.A. Cup twice.

To say they are happy with 4th and constantly finish there is just ridiculous.

I'm not an Arsenal fan, but Wenger is one of the best managers we've seen and gets stick from the English press for what? For constantly fighting against billionaires with limited resources. He sells off his top assets and yet still maintains a hugely successful club.

The 4th place thing is a joke and people saying it have no idea what they're talking about.

Since he was appointed in 1996 Arsenal have finished in the top 3 12 times.

true,dandolinho,lfcflame,,"Oh i agree, his unpredictability is a huge asset, but not something that couldnt be remedied with the right buy(s). Having a player like coutinho there already helps, his vision to an out and out striker would i think cover that loss. Add a player like Erickson (who i really like) or ideally Reus at Dortmund (long shot, but Henrick has gone there, who i would assume is competition for him, in a world cup year, Reus has ambitions to play a part in a real good exciting German side, if he isnt playing he wont tho, a loan or a tempting offer could persuade him, again as a long shot :P) would all fit in beautifully, along with a striker, dare i say, in the mould of a solskjaer or more recently Hernandez. I get this feeling that Rodgers inherited Suarez and he isnt really a Rodgers player, but his class makes him an automatic starter (when he isnt suspended). I just feel the team, with the money invested right would have a better balance. We had more shots on goal than any team in the top 5 leagues last season, and Suarez was the main contributor, but so many of his 'chances' that missed, would have been better if he had picked someone out who had made better space. He can be too greedy some times, to the detriment of the team as a whole. If we could keep him happy, id love him to stay, he's a little bastard, but he is our little bastard (for now a tleast).

true,420CARLSAGAN420,null,null,"&gt;The number of people who would have a plausible reason to store large amounts of entirely random data is pretty low.

It's really not.  In fact I know that a few games which store compressed data in very large files, they then have offsets to specific places in the file and the required data to be able to decompress them.  If that file is moved out of the game directory then they could say it's encrypted data quite easily when it's absolutely not, the overlap with people who own programs that do this and encryption is probably very big.

&gt; and the file matched the output of such a program

What do you mean?  The data is random, you can't redo it and expect it to ever match.

&gt;For that same reason, a random file and a bunch of encryption tools means that it's very likely the file is encrypted.

How can you say it's very likely when it's not?  Does that mean they should assume the 700MB file on my drive is encrypted even though it's not?  I asked around and found 2 other people I know that would also fall into this catergory, that's not many but it's way outside of being able to assume that it's encrypted.

&gt;A partition could be justified as being wiped by certain secure programs, but only if there's no boot loader or other clear reference to it.

That'd be a good way to hide stuff actually, fill the drive with random data (which some secure wipe programs do) then write your encrypted file to an unused part of the drive and do not add it to the file system.  Of course you wouldn't want to ever move or copy anything around or from the drive, or let anything defragment it.

The article's own comments on NHS funding are quite atrocious:

It might be for similar reasons to there being no decent right-wing comedians. What's interesting about punching downwards at the people less privileged than yourself or those who argue for equality of opportunity over elitism? That just looks spiteful and bullying.

From the article:

&gt;&gt;The figures released this week by the French government's tourism arm, DGCIS, came amid claims that visa rules for Chinese people coming to Britain are ""colonial"" and costing the country up to £5 million per day.

&gt;&gt;France retained its pole tourism ranking in 2012 with 83 million foreign visitors bringing in a total 35.8 billion euros (£31 billion) in revenue. Britain was ranked seventh in the tourism league table, with just under 30 million foreign visitors. 

It seems that was more omission for a newspaper article than anything else but it does figure.

For many Chinese, they travel to ""see Europe"" and not necessarily to see Paris, and if two Schengen gateways are making entry approval easy then it is more likely that they will enter by either of those countries and tour around the rest of the Schengen area and fly home. Thus the idea of a visit to London can be totally forgotten about as it is a separate visa application **process**.

&gt;So the operation entails introducing 100s if not thousands of (on a geological scale) hairline weaknesses through aquifers and bedrock, lined with steel and cement piping.

Except for it doesn't, the borehole is a steel pipe lined with concrete. That travels about 8k underground and is perforated to allow the fracking fluid access to the gas. The maximum height of a fracture is just 1km, with only 1 per cent being higher than 350m.

&gt;It seems ""regulation"" was playing catch-up and now there is a ""traffic light"".

Remember there have only been three exploratory bores in the UK so far. The regulations are still being formed. The traffic light system is mentioned in the Royal Society report which was completed post-Cuadrilla. 
&gt;Had the above thresholds been in place for Cuadrilla’s
operations, no mitigating action would have been
taken preceding the 2.3 M
L
event on 1st April 2011
(Green
et al
2012). The report commissioned by the
Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC)
into the seismic events at Preese Hall proposed
a more precautionary set of lower magnitude
thresholds (Green
et al
2012). 

Part 5.5.3 off the Royal Society report. 
.
&gt;Presumably at the end of it because we know 60% of the fluid remains it becomes more toxific as it mixes with what ever nature saw fit to lock away from the surface.

Toxific isn't a word, I don't understand what the last part even means. Do you think geology picks what is stored underground?

Operators remain financially liable for their wells once they are closed.

&gt;DECC requires operators to submit an abandonment
plan and obtain consent before operations to
abandon a well are commenced. Abandonment
requirements are considered in the initial design of
the well to ensure the well is left in a satisfactory
condition to prevent future leakage. Operators are
required to design, construct and operate wells so
that they can be suspended or abandoned in a safe
manner, after which there can be no unplanned
escapes of fluids (Schoenmakers
et al
2009). HSE
would be notified of the abandonment, and receive
weekly reports of the abandonment process. The
abandonment would also be reviewed under the
well examination scheme (see section 3.2). Unless
there is unusual or adverse development during the
abandonment process, no subsequent monitoring is
currently required.
Monitoring arrangements should be developed
to detect possible well failure post abandonment.
Continuous ground gas monitoring and aquifer
sampling could be similar to that carried out before
and during fracturing operations. Temporary
monitoring equipment could be used, such as that
used to monitor emissions from landfill sites or
even semi-permanent monitoring stations could
be installed. Monitoring would be at a reduced
frequency, perhaps every few years. This requires
techniques that can reliably distinguish between
methane from non-shale operations in the areas
of abandoned wells. Operators are responsible
for wells once abandoned. Operators have an
open-ended liability to remediate any ineffective
abandonment operations. Consideration should
be given to establishing mechanisms, such as a
common liability fund, to ensure funds are available
to respond to well failure post-abandonment in the
case that the operator can no longer be identified

Part 3.3.4 of the Royal Society Report

I apologise for using that EA source, I didn't see the first part. But the well is capped in multiple places using the same technology as is used in gas wells around the world, including in the North Sea. I honestly don't see your problem here, people have a problem with the fracking itself not the removal of gas and closure of the well, both are trivial processes. 

Part 1.2 of the Royal Society report under abandonment describes how the well is capped.

We are not financially in need of the money, he has a 3 year contract, all the stuff about a clause is essentially pretty superfluous because a fee has to be agreed before that really matters anyway and the club has repeatedly said he wouldn't be sold. I'd also venture to guess that a transfer request would make little difference in this scenario.

For a club without CL football to offer right now, finding a replacement is impossible, even if spread amongst a few singings and as I said it would only make that task harder by giving him to Arsenal, probably the weakest of the CL spot teams this year. 

I know managers talk a lot sometimes but the only indication so far of any sort of price has been Rodger's mentioning Cavani, who went for £55m.

I quite liked the blog, i think it was rounded and highlighted the hypocrisy of the arsenal fans right now, and i liked to read that his concerns mirrored what i think would be arsenals problem should they buy suarez, namely that they need strengthening in other areas way more than a striker.

(Quote; ""And will one striker make the difference between us winning the league or not? Chuck in a couple of centre-half injuries, a crocked Arteta, and Suarez won’t make that much difference to anything."")

we do need him, and this isn't Sex and the City. we aren't looking for someone to marry, but trying to get back up the table, and the summer has shown that the only chance we have of starting the season with a proven, world-class player in the team is to keep Suarez.

i'm not saying i like how it's going, but i'm a pragmatist at heart, and i want the club back in the CL so we can sign better players and have more freedom to spend overall. keeping LS is crucial to us having any hope of that next season at all, although i admit it is a long shot.

You have a point and if you don't think it's enough to stand on it's own without resorting to bland annoying stereotypes you are best not bothering. For example, and maybe this is why I've taken such umbrage, I am middle class, and you have every right to think my point is naive but suggesting I'm naive *because* I'm middle class instead of just arguing for why I'm naive because of my views is indicative of you confirming your bias against those you disagree with.

right, based on a couple of performances in friendlies. the comparison with Torres is way off, by the time he left there were health issues that meant he was never going to play at that level again.

true,UncleIroh626,mcgann,McGann,"Your question basically boils down to: Is JNT's Who terrible? 

First off, some backstory. JNT took over as the producer on Tom Baker's last season and stayed until it was cancelled eight seasons later. Peter Davison, Colin Baker, and Sylvester McCoy were all the Doctor under his tenure.

What's tricky about having one consensus for his era is that it's pretty big and varied. He most certainly made a lot of terrible decisions, such as turning down many of Davison's ideas for his doctor and putting Colin Baker in one of the worst coats ever made instead of his preferred black suit. And yet, there are plenty of fantastic episodes that were made under him. Caves of Androzani, Davison's last story, is often considered to be one of, if not the best episode of Doctor Who. Sylvester's last two seasons are beloved by a part of fandom. The E-Space Trilogy in Tom's last season, Enlightenment from Peter's second, Revelation of the Daleks in Colin's first... All great stories.

The era is just too large to really get a general opinion on. However, I think it would be fitting to say that JNT's Who was flawed, suffering from a variety of things that weren't all JNT's fault (look up Michael Grade) but with flashes of brilliance and original ideas throughout.

true,m1dn1ght5un,cnty-england,England,"I think it's very presumptuous of you to set yourself as the arbiter of who has 'traction' in British public life. You're also moving the goalposts slightly. You said there were no journalists of note - I gave you ten noteworthy, award-winning journalists from respected sources who produce high quality writing. If you'd have asked me for ten popular right-wing commentators, I would have given you examples from The Mail or The Sun etc instead.

So what did you mean by noteworthy? If you meant people with large readerships/followings I can list you a bunch of imbeciles from the Mail and the Sun. You can certainly do the same with idiots from the Mirror. If you meant people producing quality, award winning journalism - I think I made my point already.

Unless there's some kind of third category? Those non-populist lefty writers who have 'traction' because they write for the blogs you read or get discussed at the parties you go to? 

By all means, list me ten 'noteworthy' leftist journos/bloggers and the publications they work for. I would love to see your interpretation of the definition and I can offer one of my own.

There's a particular type of arrogance that permeates a lot of the intellectual left - that they have a monopoly on ethics and social justice/responsibility.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Except for it doesn't, the borehole is a steel pipe lined with concrete. That travels about 8k underground and is perforated to allow the fracking fluid access to the gas. 

You've not understood I think. Each well will be one of ~hundreds/thousands of fractures. I'm not sure what you are implying with 8km because desired locations range from ~350m to ~5km ([page38](http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/policy/projects/shale-gas/2012-06-28-Shale-gas.pdf)) This business about 1% only being fractured to a height of ""just"" 1km seems moot if not over simplified if not completely incorrect. You've taken a loose approach to sourcing and now a loose approach to metrics. I'll have a sit down and go through the Royal Society Report fully, but nothing you are showing me is making me feel assured—quite the opposite. The more I read of that and others the more I believe we are headed for a fracking nightmare long term, and that's before I even consider climate change.

You say regulation has all the answers, but it's always a plastic process competing with profit and lobbying: ""Be prepared to alter plans. Injection rates may need to be reduced or wells may even need to be abandoned should the seismicity induced be too great.""

Again there are known and unknown unknowns: ""There is a lack of data on the mechanical and flow properties of shales, such as permeability and gas migration potential."" I'm sticking with the idea that this is a naive endeavour. I could have more respect for fracking if it took a few, perhaps even a dozen to maturity but we've are seeing this rolled out en masse—disproportionately in the North. I notice the Duchy isn't trail blazing in this regard.

&gt; Toxific isn't a word, I don't understand what the last part even means. Do you think geology picks what is stored underground?

Congrats pointing out a typo—toxic—I changed the sentence and didn't edit toxification correctly. Biology seems to be the selective pressure—what is useful tends to get recycled at the surface and in the air.

1. It is not a young industry, fracking has been widespread since the 80s.
1. Remember there have only been three exploratory bores in the UK so far. The regulations are still being formed. 

Again we have an internal conflict to your prose.

&gt; people have a problem with the fracking itself not the removal of gas and closure of the well

This is unfair because for many it's the whole context. This is not the vast desert, this is not the open sea.

Totally happy to make that presumption. However, I do also work in a media related field and have access to various other metrics.However...

&gt;So what did you mean by noteworthy? If you meant people with large readerships/followings I can list you a bunch of imbeciles from the Mail and the Sun. You can certainly do the same with idiots from the Mirror. 

I meant people who produce interesting and informed writing about important social issues, not just reporters. Those on the right who write about those sorts of things seem simply to condemn without examination or feasible solutions being presented.

&gt;There's a particular type of arrogance that permeates a lot of the intellectual left - that they have a monopoly on ethics and social justice/responsibility.  

Well, duh. Of course they do. It's hardly arrogant to point this out.

&gt; It allows you to smugly dismiss out of hand anyone articulating a position to the right of the spectrum and paint all Tories as essentially immoral, greedy fear mongerers.

I'd argue that this is a feature of *most* Tories of the current crop, yes, but that's because the evidence seems to support it. I'd perhaps be as generous as to suggest that some of them like Claire Perry are just ill-informed rather than necessarily immoral though. Older Tories do seem to have had a sense of obligation to society and duty to serve others, rather than the kind of aspirational individualism that denotes Cameron's cabinet, but I'm hardly painting them as immoral, it's self-evident and they're acting in that manner unapologetically without any need for me to 'paint' them as anything other than what they are, and it's largely illustrated by the policy that the wealthy need more money to motivate them but the poor need things taken away to do so.  In balance, I'd hardly call Blair any different, but for different reasons.

&gt; If you spent any time actually reading some of the authors I listed above you would see how ridiculous that position really is.

If they weren't behind paywalls - which even the Telegraph seems to have something of, although seemingly operating at random now - then I might be more inclined to do so.

true,HugoChavezRamboIII,eng-norfolk,Naaaarch,"&gt;But as a centrist, why is privatising the NHS bad, if its still free at the point of use?

I believe free universal healthcare for citizens is one of the fundamentals that a state ought to be obliged to provide. Private companies' primary objective is that of profit, and I really don't like the idea of these such organisations being entrusted with my health. I want whatever organisation who is entrusted with keeping me healthy to have just that as their primary objective: to keep me, everyone else healthy.

You have but to google 'Serco' and 'NHS' to see where I'm coming from.

&gt;If privatising the NHS means better care for a reduced cost, why is that bad?

Because it comes at the expense of something, and I worry that this 'something' will be quality, and I don't think I'm a cynic for thinking this. When you become a civil servant you don't automatically become worse and doing things, and when you enter the private sector you don't automatically become better. Privatisation isn't a magic wand that fixes things. If a company makes money, someone else is always going too be losing out, and I don't want to be the one losing out, and I don't want to be a victim of corner cutting.

Pre-game festivities are ON! EvertonUSA &amp; SoCal Evertonians are excited to announce the Official Everton Supporters Pre-Game Party at Mohawk Bend (www.mohawk.la) in Echo Park Saturday August 3rd from 1-4pm. We will be singing, raffling Everton memorabilia with Everton Legend Graeme Sharp, and raising funds for the kids with Everton in the Community. So come join your fellow Bluenoses for the pre-game festivities and feel free to invite your other ICC-going friends.

&gt;There is no cover but we ask for a $10 suggested donation and/or buy some raffle tickets with all proceeds going to Everton in the Community. Mohawk Bend will be serving a special Everton menu (think great fish and chips) and tons of great pints as they are known to do. All ages are welcome. There is a parking lot and plenty of street parking in the neighborhood.

&gt;After the pre-game party, there will be plenty of inexpensive taxis to share, a nearby bus route and/or a one mile walk to Dodgers Stadium...we implore you to plan a safe day. We haven't even made it to the stadium yet mate. Kick off for the first game is 5pm...I hope we get a shot to show up Real Madrid.

true,Jenquers,null,null,"Arsenal fan here.  I agree with what arseblog has written, somewhat. This may not be a popular opinion on this sub but I do not think that Suarez is worth us potentially tripling our transfer record. His antics on and off the field actually don't bother me as much as most, (and I've read the entire transcript of the Evra incident arseblog provided) but rather, its his mindset as a footballer. IMO Suarez is a player that needs a team to revolve around him, in the sense that he needs to be the focal point of the attack in every possible way to be successful.  Suarez doesn't get the ball? Ok then, he lashes out at an opponent, or perhaps even a teammate. Suarez doesn't start? Ok, maybe he goes 50% at training for the rest of the week, rather than trying to redouble his efforts to regain his starting role. No, the biting and racism aren't the main issues in my mind. His sporting mentality is weak; he's even admitted himself that he gets frustrated and temperamental which influences his decision-making on the field. Can't break the bank for a player like that. 

Honestly, and again, I know this won't be popular here, I think Liverpool should sell him, but NOT to Arsenal. Offload him to Madrid and let him add to all the dressing room problems they already have over there. And for those Liverpool fans who say there isn't equivalent talent available out there, I would point out to you that Sturridge has been nothing short of brilliant for you guys since signing and that reinforcements can be brought in, if necessary, during the January window, though more likely next summer. Would it really be such a catastrophe for you guys to spend one more year building (this season) and really having a go at a top 4 finish next year?

The point still stands though, 1km is the maximum vertical fracture length (even if ~600m is the max fracture found), the pressures will not let fluid flow into any aquifers above even if the impermeable rock is breached. 

As for your point, our government trusts in things when they could potentially blow up or damage the environment. Industrial safety, emissions controls, car safety, aircraft safety, CFCs are banned, lead petrol is banned, GMOs are safe, pesticides that cause bee death are banned. There are a huge number of things working in the background to keep you safe. 

You cannot compare financial regulation and industrial regulation, economics is not a science, there is modelling but by and large it is educated guesswork.

I wouldn't say I'm a layman, I'm no expert but I have experience in the industry, I know my way around a process and I understand the key engineering theory behind it. I'm also fairly well versed on the law when it comes to regulating these things, process safety is drilled into us at every turn, it is the key part of my course, ensure everything is safe is the first priority, making money is the second. 

You haven't really got a clue what you're talking about, our previous discussion proved that when I debunked every claim you made, you haven't sourced anything (expect for an anti-fracking blog written by a somebody who doesn't have anything to do with petroleum engineering).

The main danger of fracking is water supply contamination. That is essentially the only danger worth worrying about. The only way the water supply could possibly be contaminated is if the concrete well casing is compromised during the fracking process. As long as the concrete holds the process is safe. Ensuring the concretes holds is the responsibility of regulatory bodies as outlined in the various reports I've mentioned (reports written by actual experts rather than random bloggers). If you don't want to trust those experts that is fine, your opinion doesn't matter. The opinions that matter are those engineers and scientists who actually understand this, who research this for a living.

A conversation can mean anything. It can be the fact that it took ages to discuss something else so they had to delay talking about the subject. It can be a reminder of the current legislation. It could be a review of Crosby's previous and current employers.

As a matter of principle, Cameron does not specify what is said in conversations as there is no possible way to accurately or effectively recall or remember.

Ah - the old 'trust me - I'm in the know' argument.

&gt;I meant people who produce interesting and informed writing about important social issues, not just reporters. Those on the right who write about those sorts of things seem simply to condemn without examination or feasible solutions being presented.

There remains a conspicuous lack of any examples from you so far. You were quick to ask me for some, so I think its only fair you provide some of your own. Furthermore, many of the people I listed DO produce 'interesting and informed writing about social issues'. The fact that you either don't read it or don't agree with it is frankly immaterial. 

&gt;Well, duh. Of course they do. It's hardly arrogant to point this out.

This is where your argument just gets silly. You're claiming that in order to be ethical one must subscribe to *your* particular world view? The arrogance of it is staggering. How can you hope to have discussion and debate with people if you dismiss them outright as unethical and unconcerned with improving society?

&gt;I'm hardly painting them as immoral, it's self-evident and they're acting in that manner unapologetically without any need for me to 'paint' them as anything other than what they are

Self evident to you perhaps. Not to me. Not to millions of people who elected them at the previous election and who continue to support them now. The vast majority of their supporters are nothing like that 'rich' demographic. Yet you arrogantly dismiss them out of hand as being either actively immoral or so stupid they aren't able to see the 'self-evident' truth you refer to. Not you though - you're the smart one. It's everyone else who's wrong. 

&gt;If they weren't behind paywalls - which even the Telegraph seems to have something of, although seemingly operating at random now - then I might be more inclined to do so. But the fact that they're aligning themselves with models that are more interested in making money than providing news and comment, then I'll have to miss out.

Right - so you refuse to buy their newspaper  and demand they give it to you for free online - then  criticise the papers for trying to monetise their hard work in the face of plumetting newspaper sales - ostensibly because people like you don't buy them. There's some whacky circular logic going on there.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"&gt;You're claiming that in order to be ethical one must subscribe to your particular world view? 

Doesn't everyone believe this, though? But the short version is 'yes'. Or, at least, the kind of reciprocal altruism that seems utterly anathema to many right-wingers anyway. Citing 'trickle-down' as altruism, which is what they seem to do in the face of this kind of request for justification of greed goes against the evidence of what actually happens when power and influence is centralised.

&gt;There remains a conspicuous lack of any examples from you so far. You were quick to ask me for some, so I think its only fair you provide some of your own.

It's a bit pointless to do so because the ones I'd cite, I suspect you'd attack on ideological grounds rather than of quality, but if you imagine a list that starts with someone like Laurie Penny and ends up at George Monbiot you'd probably be about right. I doubt either of us have time for a tit for tat dissection of each list just because Somebody On The Internet is Wrong, however.

&gt;How can you hope to have discussion and debate with people if you dismiss them outright as unethical and unconcerned with improving society?

Well, if they've no interest in altruism or a common good then there's no hope for it at all, sure. Likewise when they deny data and evidence on important issues. I genuinely don't believe that the Dellingpoles and Littlejohns and Phillipses of the world are interested in improving society, just reshaping it in their image.

You may well say that I am too, but I consider my 'image' to be a far more cosmopolitan and inclusive one than I'm certain they do. But sure, there's no room in it for people who'll exploit others or act cruelly in the face of data or statistics that show they're wrong, a la Ian Duncan Smith and George Osbourne and Michael Gove, with his Premier Inn sourced figures, sure. 

&gt;Yet you arrogantly dismiss them out of hand as being either actively immoral or so stupid they aren't able to see the 'self-evident' truth you refer to.

I'm not sure why that's arrogant. I do believe that a vote for the Tories, or UKIP or the BNP is either actively immoral or stupid, yes. Because these groups have no interest in the common good. Only benefits for people that they believe are akin to themselves.

&gt;Right - so you refuse to buy their newspaper and demand they give it to you for free online - then criticise the papers for trying to monetise their hard work in the face of plumetting newspaper sales - ostensibly because people like you don't buy them. There's some whacky circular logic going on there.

Monetising it is fine. Demanding subscription when there are other models available and then attacking sources of news which use them, is not.

After that though, you're probably pretty used to it by now so it's not going to suddenly doing something and then having some sight removed. You'll learn with it, it just might make you take a bit more time/effort into looking around your car when you're about to do anything. I have a strong prescription (in glasses) so I tend to have to move my head more than someone wearing contacts because I don't have the peripheral vision clarity. Don't worry about it.

It's a good idea to start with an instructor, because your mum probably has some bad habits (whether she realises or not). After a few lessons though combining going out with her and the odd lesson will really help you progress.

I went with an independent instructor - a good one will be quite busy though. It does mean they're very unlikely to keep you hanging on waiting to take your test etc. because they rely so heavily on word of mouth recommendations and it's completely their time. I can't remember the specific name but I think instructors have to pass something to a certain level (level 4? of something) where the best level is 6. You're looking for anyone certified to level 5 or 6 if you can. Anything else they have is always a bonus. If I recall stuff like 'DIP DI' means they are qualified to actually train instructors themselves. My college used to endorse a couple of the best qualified in the area, but i'm not sure where else would be best to find information of who operates around where you are.

Alternatively, there's the driving schools and they can vary quite a bit from different areas. I don't know an awful lot about them, but a couple of my friends were somewhat iffy about them.

Ideally: ask anyone you know who has learnt to drive within the past few years. Old college friends, family or co-workers. You're going to get an honest opinion out of them.

To start: make a single lesson with an instructor (independent or school). Make sure you actually like them! Particularly if you're quite anxious then you'll benefit from someone you feel comfortable around. It can be pretty scary at times but really, go in there with confidence and you'll settle down quickly. It's like spending an hour in the car with a friend really ;)

I'd also avoid the whole ""10 lessons for £60!"" sort of deals. They just scream poor quality to me. Someone here might've had good experience with them but generally if they're having to offer that sort of price then they're: not very popular (disgruntled customers?) or not very qualified and are trying to start up etc. I expect you can probably get things a bit cheaper through the driving schools as opposed to independents but it really depends I think. My instructor was £22/hour, although I did blocks of 10 for £200. Anything that works out below £15 an hour seems a bit off to me, personally, but it's not a hard and fast rule.

Getting started on the driving theory stuff fairly early is always handy as well, mainly just for the road markings and signs. It will make you feel a bit more at ease when you go out onto the main roads. The first couple of lessons will probably involve somewhere pretty quiet. I used to go to an industrial estate so there wasn't really any traffic flowing around. 

My wall of text is complete. Go in there with a positive mind, and confidence! Driving is a great freedom and it is enjoyable, if you let it be. ",0,1374686575,null,0,false,0,cb9dh29,t3_1iysef,t1_cb9dh29,t3_1iysef,null,1430351834,12,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,12

That is, if one cannot prove beyond a shadow of doubt that an environmental impact is due to drilling, then a link is rejected. This approach by the tobacco companies had a devastating and long-lasting effect on public health from which we have still not recovered, and we believe that a similar approach to the impacts of gas drilling may have equally negative consequences.”

Also, there are not many replacement options in the market at the moment. This is kind of a ""can look at it both ways"" scenario, as while there is not much choice, people will be willing to pay more for Suarez now. However, If we keep him and don't get 4th, there may be a lot more available strikers, Suarez will have a year less on his contract and there might not be as much interest - meaning we lose him for less.

On the other hand, If he wants to go I don't see the need in holding him to randsom like United are doing with Rooney. If we get what we want for him, then we should think about selling; we have potential replacements in the team at the moment, and there is always January to ""reinforce"". We proved without the likes of Alberto, Aspas (and Borini for a while) that we don't depend on him as much as we thought, so we could hold on to the Suarez money, strengthen the midfield/defence, and save the rest for an ""up and coming"" in January.

I refuse however to accept we will let him go to another PL club, particularly one that we will be battling for a CL spot. If I saw Suarez in an Arsenal shirt next season I would be livid.

In a mildly related topic, I really really hope that Spurs hold on to Bale.

You can also find no end of wonders in charity shops and they tend to be bunched together.  There's a fantastic [charity shop map](http://www.changeworks.org.uk/uploads/Edinburgh-Charity-Shop-Map-2010-Full.pdf) available.  Personally I like the Old Town/Newington and Stockbridge bunches. They're great for clothes and bric-a-brac. Newington tends to be cheaper as it is quite a studenty area but Stockbridge being posher has nicer stuff for not that much more. 

You will see people haggling in charity shops - do not do this yourself. They're acting as charity for those they are supporting, not for you.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"&gt; don't worry

I wouldn't go that far. This looks close to happening and the bigger clubs aren't even bidding yet. As soon as a price range is settled, £50M or whatever, the other clubs will bid (Real Madrid, Chelsea). 

The Arsenal fans had a point re: compensation. They mean that Suarez hands in a transfer request and then he is compensated on his missed payments from LFC as part of the signon bonus at Arsenal. This ironically may also have tax benefits that would make it a profitable move.

He will be handing in a transfer request in any case - either himself or the club will ask him to put one in after they agree a fee. Liverpool rarely sell a big name player, even if they agree the fee, without a transfer request (eg. Torres was asked to file one, as was Gerrard re: Chelsea).

My interpretation of Suarez staying or going has swayed a lot, but I am definitely leaning towards him leaning based on the last 24 hours. I think it will still take another 2-3 weeks, but i'd rate it at 80% going right now with a club likely meeting our valuation and a fee of £50M + addons being paid

You mean the oil industry. Are you honestly saying we can evaluate the safety of a technological process based on whether the oil industry would rather pay to dispose of waste properly or just chuck it in the river nearby?

*Of course* they're going to do such things, it's cheaper and gets them more money, what we need to do is say ""Can this method of oil extraction which works and has massive potential be made safe via a method of regulation and development of operating procedures and relevant H&amp;S for both the workers and the general public?""

In this case the answer to that is a very resounding ""Yes!"" and when you consider that we require *some* form of energy production, and we have safer and better ones and less safe and worse ones - well which do you want?

None of them come out of the womb fully formed, constant improvement is required, but that's life.

true,Chazwatti,lfc68,,"All your points are well considered and fair but when I say don't worry I am referring to him going to Arsenal not just him leaving.

I'd say he's 50/50 leaving now and about 30% going to Arsenal. The £50m+ isn't £50m, it's just somewhere over £50m so could be £55m, could be £60m and Liverpool have every right to ask for what they want. Only other thing I'd say on that point is LFC are unlikely to care about how much money Suarez gets due to loyalty bonuses and compensated sign-on fees etc and that won't change our selling price, why should it, we're losing a player we don't want to lose. Similarly people say his price is lower because he's banned etc, which is nonsense because we don't want to sell him anyway, why should we care whether he's banned for a new team, not our problem.

I think the key is Madrid getting involved, because I understand he'd much rather go there, we'd much rather sell there (even for a significantly lower fee) and all of us here don't want to see him in the Premier league. 

Whatever the case I expect LFC to play hardball with any buyer, it isn't a negotiation, we can name a price and not accept a penny under, mostly because I believe the club is confident Suarez will still play for us even if we force him to stay and even in the event of a transfer request.",0,1374690307,null,0,1374691076,0,cb9f1gx,t3_1iymm0,t1_cb9f1gx,t1_cb9eag5,null,1430351095,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Agreed.

EDIT: I saw you were responding to my paywall comment. My point was more that people won't have access to the sun website without subscribing, and the paywall will likely come in before the porn filter so it's sort of a non-issue anyway. I can't see people subscribing just for Page 3 (assuming its on the site anyway) when the likes of redtube exist.

&gt;It's obvious this is a scam to cover the lobbying row.

Agreed, although they were going on about that Lynton bloke again on the news today.

&gt;You can't announce a ban on porn, and allowance for tits in papers (which kids will see on public transport on school bus) and a ban on the same tits online (which parents have some control over).

I agree. I was more interested in the point that a large organisation like the Girl Guides was supporting a ban on Page 3 yet Cameron had been very wishy-washy and said that buying the Sun was a matter of individual choice. See my comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1it4uw/david_cameron_has_said_he_would_never_support_a/cb81lkp).

Meanwhile the internet filter will be default on with the ""choice"" to opt-out (and no doubt have your name put on a govt. list of ""unfiltered"" users when you do so...)

&gt;It's a smokescreen, it's backfired, because the duchess going to labour would have been perfect without the humilation and electoral damage this announcement will bring to every voter under 60.

true,Pikul,lfc87,null,"Yeah, Madrid declaring interest is what I'm hoping. Obviously I'd like the club to convince him to stay as he would be a massive loss, but the writings on the wall, he wants to leave. His behavior since the end of last season has soured my perception of him however, he's dragged the club through shit and we all stuck by him yet he openly talks about moving to other clubs and how great it would be to play for them, he was asked about these clubs but that doesn't mean he had to answer them.

I'm not gonna stick my head in the sand and blame others for this or make excuses, all the speculation, bids, contract talk, hounding by the media etc. is becuase of Suarez himself, no one else, he didn't have to explain to the media how he wanted to play for other other clubs. He could have kept it quiet, said it to the club privately and handed in a transfer request, instead, he's gone another route of putting massive pressure on the club. 

If he stays it won't really be the same though, I won't look at him as fondly as I did last season, even though he gave me one of the best moments I've ever experienced (was standing in the Kop when he scored the 96th minute equaliser against Chelsea) there'll always be the niggling thought about what he's done. I'll support him like I would any player at the club and maybe after he bangs in goals I'll look at him warmly again because I'm a football fan and football fans are fickle by default, but at the moment that fondness for him is gone.

If Madrid offer 40+ million we should take it. We could get 2-3 players that could strengthen the team in all areas, take your pick of the players we've been linked to Eriksen, Soldado, Papadopoulos, Alderweireld, Shaqiri etc. none particularly as good as Suarez but any combination of them will benefit the team when he goes.

true,UNC_Samurai,null,null,"When Tennant said ""I don't want to go"", some people thought he'd been chewing the scenery and over-acting enough that the line became a sort of summary of his last few hours on television.  A character who had become a bit too campy, who hadn't been with us all that long, but at times started to wear out his welcome.  And, in some sense, we weren't all that sad to see him go, because the alternative was to let the character drag on until it was painfully obvious that his quirks had become schtick, his charm becoming smarmy.

But it seems that with Smith, he had a sort of brilliant confluence of what made other Doctors iconic.  At times he was the aloof Pertwee, the manic Troughton, and occasionally the vaudevillian McCoy (if you've heard McCoy read Smith's speech from Pandorica Opens, the shared traits between the two are just a bit eerie).

And through all of it, Smith (not unlike Tennant) held to many of the characteristics honed by Davison.  The modern Doctor rests on a much more solid doctrine of abhorring the use of violence, and doing so only reluctantly and under duress.  Davison was reserved, even a little somber, but he was never really brooding.  Tennant and Smith certainly took that trait a little further, but both RTD and Moffat used the Time War as a nebulous plot point that allowed the Doctor to be cheerful one minute and suddenly swell with a righteous fury to unleash upon the unweary callous soul (Time and Space forgive the wretch who stepped on someone relatively unimportant and didn't even remember their name).

Eccelstone was a Doctor in rehabilitation, The Last of the Time Lords.  

Tennant was a Doctor in transition, and at the precipice of his journey he thought he was the Time Lord Victorious.  

Smith, however, was a Doctor doing what the Doctor does; having fun and saving the universe.

He was not just a Doctor.  For many who came to this show through the new series, he *is* The Doctor.

And if he wants to end with, ""I don't want to go..."" then we will truly be sad, because Matt Smith could have been the second coming of Tom Baker, the man who defines the role for an entire generation.

Here's the problem with the mentality that we need to find someone to 'replace' him and his production: we start getting into thinking that it's one guy who can step in and do what he does.  That is just not realistic.

If we are to believe that the transfers of Coutinho, Sturridge, and the like are becoming the trend (god I hope)...we should probably look to how the money will be smartly invested in the squad.

So if we could have penciled in Suarez for 30 goals a year...and now we face losing that, maybe it's not about the one player who we can pop in to replace that production but more so how we can invest in players who collectively can produce those numbers.

The benefit of this, which /u/QuantoQuandoQuatro was alluding to is that we now have a number of players capable of carrying to team to where we need to be.  If you look at where we have been, not having that consistency has really hurt us.

Perhaps if they did some visible policing rather than spunking their budget on fancy cameras the population would feel a little safer and they could maybe address whatever criminal actions which are occurring, and then people would be less adverse to visiting and pumping a bit of outside cash into their little economy.

I was attacked by a security guard - cuffed so tight it broke the skin a little and told to be quiet when I complained (Against European torture laws) and put in a cell for 22 hours before being released because the CCTV (That was controlled from the room I was arrested in) showed I didn't do anything.

I was attacked my a police mans son and defended myself, I was asked the exact same question in interview without a solicitor present 6 times. 6 times when they are only allowed to ask once, trying to get me to answer differently so they could discredit everything else I had said. Saved me in court though when my solicitor called out that officer infront of the judges.

I've had more than one case fall through and charges dropped because it would be assigned to an officer who would then ""go on holiday"" and when he got back it would be transferred to someone else until 6 months had elapsed so they could drop it to boost their statistics.

Every time I've been assaulted in the last year (I work a rough job) the first thing the officer has said to me is ""Do you want to go the community resolution route?"" yet in the papers recently is an article about a man doing 12 weeks in prison for assaulting a police officer - meanwhile they think everyone else just needs a letter of apology? It's less paperwork, lazy officers do not inspire confidence.

I've had an officer ask me 3 separate times if I was sure I didn't want to go Community Resolution then go behind my back and do it anyway, then when I was called and told by him that the man was given a warning I asked what he meant, and if that means he had been cautioned. 
This officer then BS'd me saying no just a warning and that's all they could do as if I had no idea how the system worked and I called him out on it, he hung up. During that call he said I was ""Trying to crucify the poor man"" biased as fuck.
So I called back - told by some woman who answered he had just gone out. I was actually just outside the station and called this woman out on lying to me - then she hung up.  
This was only resolved when I called 101 and explained the situation, had the original officer call me up the next day to suck up to me and tell me the guy had received a caution.

I'll stop there but there is plenty plenty more. Every interaction I have ever had with a police officer has lowered my opinion of the 'profession'.",0,1374698516,null,0,false,0,cb9igmk,t3_1iy3sb,t1_cb9igmk,t1_cb9hqld,null,1430349484,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"You're right, Spurs aren't Real Madrid, but I think that makes us more likely to keep Bale.

From everything I've read about him from reputable sources, he's a ""put your head down and work"" player who shies from the limelight and wants nothing to do with the media circus surrounding him.

Madrid have done nothing but hype him up and create a media whirlwind around him; how is that endearing them to him??

As to my estimation of the upcoming season; yes, it's all pure speculation, but I'd like to believe it's grounded in sound logic.

Arsenal did finish 2nd in the form table. The form table only takes into account 5 games. Arsenal's last 5 games were; @ Newcastle, v Wigan, @ QPR, v Man Utd, and @ Fulham. That's 2 relegated clubs, 2 bottom half clubs, and United, who had sewn up the title. And Arsenal only drew with them. Not exactly inspiring for them.

United aren't winning the title next year. Period. Here's their first 5 games; @ Swansea, v Chelsea, @ Liverpool, v Palace, @ City. And you're telling me that Moyes, who has never beaten a ""top 4"" side away from Goodison Park, isn't going to struggle to start on form?

City, it is pure speculation. Nobody knows how Pelligrini will do, and how the players will integrate. Kind of my point.

Chelsea; Mourinho is who he is, Chelsea is talented. They'll be good, probably the team to beat, especially since they have an easy start to the year (other than the trip to Old Trafford)

And that leaves Spurs, a team who would've finished 3rd in a table discounting the first 3 games of last year's season.

In my mind if we take Soldado and make the CL then, we can eat the 30m and be happy; if we dont make CL, we can use the loss of Bale's wages (when he does leave to Real for CL) to make up in the 30m bucket drop we took on Soldado.

The only trophy RVP won was after a subs appearance in an FA cup final 9 years ago and they have won nothing since.

Think to yourself, how did our club manage to win while being in the shadow of other financial powerhouses while Arsenal cannot?

Wenger inherited a great defensive unit, denis bergkamp and initialy added great young talent to it.

Ever since that unit finally left the game ( just after there amazing invincibles year ) wenger has failed to replace the defensive unit of the side.

They can beat the smaller clubs consistently and that is how the achieve a top 4 league standing.

They don't win things because they fold in cup competitions through lack of steel in the defensive part of there game, when the game pressure increases.

They sell there best players and replace them with potential? 

Never building in order to win?

You seem to look at the game entirely from a statistical standpoint and consider finance the most important factor.

Although an important factor, I would say having a team that can compete to win things is more important. 

At least our club is trying to build towards a winning mentality. 

Not just trying to become a cash cow, milking it's fans dry, forever outside Europes elite.

We were part of that elite and, I believe, will be again.

Henry had a claim on Wales (as in legal by even the standards of the Welsh lords) via his father and England via his mother.

So it wasn't until the 16th century that it was even possible for it to be routinely claimed by English royalty.

In truth it is questionable how close Henry was to being legitimate Prince of Wales. The houses could technically elect anyone they wanted but there were certain traditions involved much like the Saxon rules. Of course in reality they were Anglicised to the point where they just wanted to end the split and be recognised as legitimate.
