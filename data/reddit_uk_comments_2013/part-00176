We should be about 3-1 down, really, although Pearce could well have had a hat-trick from all the chances he's had at corners. He's won nearly every header up there, so that could bode well for Smith. Austin has been playing on the right wing with Green back in front of the defence, but I would still bring Tonge on for Green (and would have started with Tonge) because we've been seriously struggling to string two passes together and look after the ball.

Yes, there's people like that.

So punish them, don't just attack everyone to hit a minority.

If people are looking for work, and it's fairly clear if they are, they don't NEED to be placed on a system where there's targets.

If there's x number of jobs suitable, they'll apply for x number, if its only y, they can't apply for x, unless they start applying for jobs not suited to them, purely because they have to apply for pointless shit to keep their money coming in.

It wastes the claimant's time and money.
It wastes the employers' time and money.
It wastes the DWP's time and money, and most of all it's wasting taxpayers' money, who apparently are the ones it's being done for.

A vast amount of the jobseeker's agreement seems to be creating pointless busy work for jobseekers, based on ensuring they don't have too much free time to themselves, in some strange bid to give everyone the illusion that they're 'working' for their benefit money, in finding work.

I still maintain that until the job market recovers and unemployed people aren't outnumbering vacancies 5 to 1, we should allow those on JSA to volunteer 20 hours a week in leiu of their agreement, obviously all official and above board, perhaps get the organiser to sign them in and out to prove the 20 hours.

It'd be a net gain for society, they'd be out there achieving, earning references, work experience, and networking with people, instead of sat at home hunched over a keyboard checking the shitty GOV job site for the fifth time that day.

And thats because you don't understand statistics or analysis at all.

If 90% of people eaten by a shark are black, that does not mean as a single black man in the city you are much more likely to be eaten by a shark than a white man swimming in the sea.

it isn't the fact the people are ""Black"" that they get eaten by a shark, its that more black people are in shark infested waters/coasts (its a hypothetical example btw).

So a black man in sweden living in suburbia is not at more ""risk"" than a white man sitting in suburbia in sweden.

also a black man swimming in shark infested water is not more at risk than a white person swimming in shark infested water.

Its quite sad this needs pointing out.

true,miiikeeey,num23,,"""Best player on the pitch"" ... that was your comment.

I was responding to what you said but I still don't think he was Fulham's best player. Yes Parker completed a LOT of passes 80/87 (92%) but that's testament to him playing the simple ball more often than not. Which is, like I mentioned in another comment exactly the problem with Parker. I will accept he is good at making himself available when his team is in possession which means he gets on the ball a fair bit in games. The reason he can complete so many passes is that other teams back off him because they don't perceive him as a threat... Parker's chances created (0/1).

Yes he won back possession quite a lot too (4) but other midfielders - Ramsey (9), Cazorla (6), Riether (6), Kacaniklic (5) - all did more defensively. 

Overall I'd say Fulham's best player was probably Riether due to his work out wide both with and without the ball. Whipped in some nice crosses which, with some work in training, might provide some ammo for Bent later in the season. So no, he wasn't the best player on the pitch for my money - Podolski or Ramsey - nor was he Fulham's best player - Riether - but hey, that's just my opinion.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Not to mention the support they give to the UK media industry - they commission a huge amount of shows from indie tv production companies, hire a large amount of IT and tech professionals, and have exceptionally good trainee programmes. Their year-long placements consist of working in different areas of the BBC and they pay well enough that a regular intern could live on it, and if you go to any media company in the world and say that the BBC trained you, you'll stand out. They support many unknown actors and actresses every year (despite the long-running jokes about them only having 30 actors), and regularly hire young, unknown writers based on their writing room programmes.

Additionally, they do things like building their drama production village just outside Cardiff, giving a great boost to the local creative industry. Even for non-creative people, they have increased tv standards so much over the years, pushing other tv channels to keep up, and continue to attract huge names to the UK to be in our tv shows, while still helping the UK produce big names of its own. They do the same with music as well, I just don't know as much about that.

It's silly for people to say that they don't benefit from the BBC/licence fee because they don't watch the shows - if anyone watches *any* UK tv at all, I can almost guarantee that most of the producers, writers, editors, directors and possibly even actors have worked at or for the BBC at some point. Even Game of Thrones, an American HBO production used Northern Irish crew due to it being filmed there, and I'm sure many of them have ties with the BBC (in fact, I know the guy who directed the ""extras"" for the DVD box sets and he worked for the BBC for a long time). Without the BBC, the standard would be way lower and a lot of those filmmakers may not still be in media because they might not have had those wages.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I wrote this in reply to the person who replied to you, but I feel I should try to make sure that you read it as well, because I feel you have a very narrow view of what the BBC offers the UK:

Not to mention the support they give to the UK media industry - they commission a huge amount of shows from indie tv production companies, hire a large amount of IT and tech professionals, and have exceptionally good trainee programmes. Their year-long placements consist of working in different areas of the BBC and they pay well enough that a regular intern could live on it, and if you go to any media company in the world and say that the BBC trained you, you'll stand out. They support many unknown actors and actresses every year (despite the long-running jokes about them only having 30 actors), and regularly hire young, unknown writers based on their writing room programmes.

Additionally, they do things like building their drama production village just outside Cardiff, giving a great boost to the local creative industry. Even for non-creative people, they have increased tv standards so much over the years, pushing other tv channels to keep up, and continue to attract huge names to the UK to be in our tv shows, while still helping the UK produce big names of its own. They do the same with music as well, I just don't know as much about that.

It's silly for people to say that they don't benefit from the BBC/licence fee because they don't watch the shows - if anyone watches any UK tv at all, I can almost guarantee that most of the producers, writers, editors, directors and possibly even actors have worked at or for the BBC at some point. Even Game of Thrones, an American HBO production used Northern Irish crew due to it being filmed there, and I'm sure many of them have ties with the BBC (in fact, I know the guy who directed the ""extras"" for the DVD box sets and he worked for the BBC for a long time). Without the BBC, the standard would be way lower and a lot of those filmmakers may not still be in media because they might not have had those wages. The BBC is an integral part of the British media and has been since it was started, it's been at the forefront of development and is still seen as the highest achievement.

To say that not watching BBC programmes means you don't benefit from it is like someone who went to private school saying that they don't benefit from state schools existing (which they do, clearly).

What I'm trying to as is it seems that black people are more highly represented in the coke dealing trade. If that **is** the case then it makes sense that more blacks will be prosecuted, likely because they had the higher amount on them needed for dealing.

If a reboot *doesn't* fix the issue then the rule of thumb is its probably a configuration or hardware issue and that they can usually help with. 

There are other reasons for rebooting being helpful, especially with older OS's that only do certain important things with drivers and the registry on boot.

Apparently offered to Utd, not encouraging signs in terms of a potential move. I'm not sure if he'd be interested in signing for us, Baldini has proved to be one persuasive bastard so far. If he's looking for a prem team that he'll get game time at, then maybe if we offer a large sign on fee and a wage at the upper end of our cap he could be persuaded. But honestly price is not an issue for us, we are loaded at the moment, we could definitely pay for his transfer which I expect is somewhere in the region on £40m. We should look to bid for this guy, wether it's realistic or it's better to fail aiming high than succeed aiming low.

Their penalty was a very soft one - you see hands on shoulders on just about every ariel duel on the pitch.

I thought hughton's tactics (perhaps barring not starting snodgrass) were spot on. For 70 minutes of the match it was norwich that were the side on top, bossing the game (until the final third at least).

I think it was just a lot of players having a bad day simultaneously that cost us in the end though. While we can normally carry one or two who decide to have a bad day, five or six of our players just didnt show up today. Garrido and Martin were the two worst for me, constantly giving it away and disrupting the flow. Johnson was also very error prone. Hoolahan when he came on gave the ball away far too much again, and most of the others all had three or four stupid errors. I just don't think there's much you can do when that happens, as it will to all teams. It was unlucky, and a fantastic chance to get our first win of the season has been spurned, but one game doesn't make a season.

There's no doubt we should have and could have been far better in all areas of the pitch, but remember: Bassong is still to come back, and snoddy is not at full fitness yet. I'd like to see Olsson at LB - in pre season he looked the part and garrido has been very dodgy in both games so far, but this is by no means the be all and end all of our season, just as 5-0 to fulham wasn't of last.

Great, great result. Winning at Portman Road after 12 years, without getting a man sent off after five games of ridiculous red cards, is just so satisfying.

The performance was far from flawless, unfortunately, and if Ipswich were at all sharper in front of goal, we would certainly have dropped points. I wouldn't want to be Tabb tonight: he pretty much cost Ipswich the game. However, we're going to continue to produce battling performances that leave us not entirely convinced until we get wingers, because the way we have to play right now will turn our games into battles and every Championship team will have a chance when it comes to that.

Nevertheless, I'm happy with the work rate and attitude of the players; coming back from going a goal down is always inspiring, although three times from four games risks getting a little tedious now (I'm convinced that if we'll probably end up losing if we take the lead first!). This squad is still very much a work in progress, with McDermott still needing to both bring in exciting players and ship out the deadwood he inherited from Warnock, so to be unbeaten and fifth in the table makes me feel uncharacteristically optimistic.

true,strolls,null,null,"And members of ethnic minorities are more likely to live in poorer areas where these checks occur, but you probably don't care about that (which is that part that's *actually* quite a shame).

It's not meaningful to discuss racism without an understanding of the larger demographics and power structures within society - it's not only your *intent* which is important, because *how you actually affect people* doesn't magically depend only upon your intent.

There are disproportionately more members of ethnic minorities living in the areas where these searches take place because we (society as a whole, which is 90% white) give them poorer educations and because [people with ""funny"" names are less likely to be offered job interviews.](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/oct/18/racism-discrimination-employment-undercover) And because they're more likely to be asylum seekers, fleeing victimisation in foreign countries. This is not to mention how we criminalise pot but leave beer and wine legal because of the tastes of old white voters from the shires.

So if we were to decide that it was important that these random stop and search operation affected people of all races equally, that it doesn't matter that this makes them a bit less efficient, then they'd stop overnight.

If the police were to start performing stop and search operations on white people, say those doing their shopping on Kensington High Street and around Camden Lock, then there'd be an uproar.

Because educated white people are more likely to write to their MP. Because of 1000 people shopping Kensington High Street, the chances that one of them has an MP in their social circle, or their family's social circle, is actually quite high.

The Daily Fucking Mail is headquartered in Kensington High Street, and the reason they don't complain about people being randomly stopped and searched is because it doesn't happen to them, it happens to black people living in Lambeth and Southwark. 

So it doesn't matter that ""I'm not racist"" and ""it's not my fault, it shouldn't affect me"" - it affects you every day, because you and I reap the benefits every day of being a member of the majority. It's not the fault of J Random Black-Kid, either, that he lives in a shitty area and gets stopped and searched all the time, but it's ok for you to advocate for that, because it doesn't affect you. 

If the police were to stop you this evening, as you walk to the shops to buy a pint of milk, and slap you in the cells for 12 or 18 hours, you'd probably no longer be saying ""oh, it's quite sad that peoples' maths isn't as good as mine"" (by which you actually mean ""people don't accept the assumptions I choose to make about these statistics"", but we'll let that one pass for the moment). Instead you'd probably be saying ""let me out, you bastards, I haven't done anything wrong"".

If the police were to stop and search you regularly, say once a month over the course of a year or two, I'll bet that pretty soon they'd catch you on a bad day and you'd slip up and say something like [""you're taking the fuckin' piss now, mate""](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1kzwjk/black_people_twice_as_likely_to_be_charged_with/cbud6c5). In doing so, you'd be giving those officers just the excuse they need to hold you in the cells overnight and slap you with an £80 fixed-penalty fine.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"You are quite right. I am writing something that is certain to be read by someone working for parliament. The statement will remain there for years if not decades as part of a digital archive known as ""The internet""

So maybe you should go back and read it again and see why I have zero fear of it coming back to bite me unless we go full-fascism.

Such as...oh I don't know...the admittance two lines into my original post that its not something I want to do in the current climate, but would consider if our scenario became comparable to the scenarios that lead up to the Arab Spring?

Or maybe the fact that my original post was analytical more than threatening, and wasn't some call to some bullshit claim at glorious revolution, but more about the power of messages and the Government's capacity to quash even that simply by letting the media be the media and, by extension, we must use all options available to us because regardless of how righteous or good our intentions, we can be sure that the Government does and would use every tool it has against us.

Or perhaps the fact that I confess to knowing nothing about wars or revolutions and thus am not likely to do very well should I attempt to spark one of either, and that my posts have been deliberately drawing comparison between full-on totalitarianism and David Camerson wanking himself off in No. 10 at the thought of all that porn he's depriving of the poor, because lord knows when your wife is lusted after by every guy (and possibly one or two women) in the Commons then you need a little extra oomph to get it up.

In fact, no, you know what?

I would say that it is the duty of the people to make absolutely fucking sure that the Government has a damn good reason to be shitting its pants on a daily basis.

Maybe you ought to be less of a tool and understand that it is the duty of the people to keep the Government in check to the same extent that the opposite is true. Right now we have other means to make certain of this. Violence is not the answer. Yet.

In an ideal world, we will never need revolutions or uprisings, but this isn't an ideal world and attitudes like yours aren't going to get us there any faster.

Assholes like you are the reason why everyone has to be so softly softly for fear of insulting anyone. I say fuck that. There's a reason why its illegal to protest outside of Parliament, they do not want to listen. So we must say things and do things to MAKE them listen. Or else we will tumble down this black hole of oppression and censorship ever faster and if they find my statements offensive or incisive or hateful then I say ""Fucking GOOD!"" because at least it proves that someone is listening.

Go work for the BBC or some shit if you want to temper everyone's speech and make everyone be nice to each other. Right now, I have three objectives.

1: Pay rent.

2: Furious masturbation

3: Making sure I know exactly what the Government is doing at any given time.

I dare any court to find anything illegal in that list and still call itself a court of law. Let me be known to GCHQ or David Cameron or to whomever reads this that that's what I plan to do. Some of those things I will do multiple times per day, some of those things I will only do once per month. I'll let you guess exactly which.

...so from the very early days, even if they attend the meetings about building the new system, are basically excluded from any meaningful say in how it will be implemented. 

As surely as night follows day, the new improved system will be shown to be a much better deal all round, costs will be shared etc. if it encompasses a broader range of the company's activities (galloping function creep can be contained by a sensible individual designer, but massively amplified by a bunch of managers in a meeting). 

By this stage the thing has achieved support at a very high level, is ""too big to fail"", and comprehensible only to management consultants and high-level managers with a vested interest in the *project*, career-wise, but who will invariably be somewhere else in a few years. 

End result: a system that costs too much and never really worked because money ran out before full functionality was delivered. No way of returning to the good old days because the organisation has been restructured twice in the meantime by the same Divine Guidance and everybody who knew how to do A Job now has a different one; the position of the goalposts has roughly stablised around getting information in and out of the new system, and damn demoralising it is too.

Henderson played a decent game, very disciplined, but he is still lacking something.

Coutinho was missed the second half, he had almost no impact on the game, maybe because villa was being overly physical with him.

true,kopking08,null,null,"Interesting match. I think we have to take positives from winning when we don't play our best. But we gotta start hoping we reach our best more often. Mignolet and Sturridge have been huge.

Main thoughts today:

Aspas had trouble finding space because Villa played their midfield tighter to the back four than Stoke did. Seemed Coutinho had much the same problem. 

Sturridge is a man on a mission who might just be the most underrated striker in the Prem. The kid can dribble, pass, hold people off, and has some smarts on him.

Johnson was woeful in my mind today. Tons of bad decisions in the final third and was basically walked by in the back. He really needs to improve.


Interesting choices by Rodgers bringing on Cissokho and Allen. He really needs to have a better plan in these 1-0 games. Coutinho has been run longer than he should in these last two matches. At the moment the game  switches to the losing teams dominance around the 75 minute mark (which usually happens in every Prem match regardless of team and quality) he should have a plan. 

Cissokho was a great addition, basically had us playing a 4-4-1-1. But the fact that Sturridge had to be back so often is troubling. We really need to figure out what we're going to do in these matches. I really wish Borini could get his head on straight because if we could bring him on around these moments of the game and have him pick a goal on the counter we'd be in great shape.

Instead we have a bunch of guys with dead legs.

Great win. Mignolet and Sturridge again making things happen. Coutinho with the moments of brilliance. Toure really makes me confident we don't need to overspend for a CB if the price isn't right.

With Suarez back I think we'll have that extra edge to win these games. But considering we'll be losing him sometime in the next 12 months, we need another goalscorer.

true,PhuQDuP,lfc99,,"The following is based on the first half, as we completely fell off for the 2nd and I think it might have been BRs tactics.

**Mignolet** What a player, I hadmy hesitations about replacing Reina but he's really showed his worth. I'm so happy to have such a young, skilled keeper.

**Enrique** Really stepped up his game since last season, All I could think was, 'man, this cissokho signing has really rattled him.' Really solid defending, great link up with Coutinho and not losing our possession as much as before.

**Agger** Not sure what's going on with him, he's not quite the brick wall he was last season but I think it's due to being able to rely on

**Toure** Loved him. Great defending, strong, smart, focused. Great take from this window. I thought we got him as a backup but he easily fits in next to Agger.

**Johnson** Same solid game as always, he has also tracked back much better than before. I'm happy to see his improvement.

**Leiva** SO disruptive to Villa. He really impeded them in the first half, when I was looking at it from a Villa supporter POV I was getting so annoyed by him, which is exactly what you want from him.

**Gerrard** Really showing his experience, so many good blocks and interceptions. He needs to lay off with his long balls, not because they're bad but because they're getting predictable. You can see Villa ready for it happening.

**Hendo and Aspas** Bit quiet this game. I think that's mostly due to everyone else being so loud though.

**Coutinho** Not his best game really, You can still see the magic he brings but I feel Villa did really well to shut him down.

**Sturridge** Lovely goal, great composure and pace. If this guy isn't England's undisputed first choice striker come WC i'll eat my juicy steak.

**Subs** All came on late, Allen scared me a lot though.

**Team** We were so cohesive in the first half, bar the linkup between Gerrard and Aspas, that needs to be worked on. We had great focus and determination, which fell off once we scored. When Suarez is back we're going to be a really scary team. ",0,1377369575,null,0,false,0,cbuj4p4,t3_1l0htk,t1_cbuj4p4,t3_1l0htk,null,1429713646,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,LondonPilot,null,null,"It's been a long time since I've bought a flat. But make sure you find out about the ground rent, and the service charge. The service charge in particular can be quite high on some flats.

Other than that, check whether your budget falls into the range where you'd have to pay stamp duty, and get a quote for conveyancing fees. Arrange a mortgage in advance, and find out about any fees your mortgage company will charge.

For the actual move, make sure you know what you'll need to do in your new flat. You'll probably need to furnish it, for example. And you'll probably need to hire a van to move your stuff (I'm guessing you haven't got enough stuff to be worth hiring professional movers if it's your first flat, but if you do want a professional removal company then that'll cost a lot more than just hiring a van.)

That's all that springs to mind. Good luck!

Edit: I forgot about conveyancing fees. And I thought I'd also mention that the last time I bought a property, I hadn't read all the small-print properly, and was surprised to find the previous owners had removed the oven when I moved in.

You often get a request by a staff member for a group of computers to have a software package installed, so in order to know if it's viable, you get the IT department to look at the software requirements in terms of computer resources.

You then have to get a multi-user license, which involves ensuring you have the finances to cover the cost of the software and the additional license. If the software is free to use then that isn't a consideration.

The IT department will then have to test the software to ensure it works with existing software on the machine, as well as ensure it is secure and doesn't contain any nasty vulnerabilities that could be exploited to get access to network resources by unauthorised users in some way.

Once the testing is done and you have a stable image of the software package in question, you then have to place it on the software deployment server and ensure the install script is working fine, and then release it on a small number of machines to ensure nothing was missed during the testing. I'm certain that many people are familiar with things going tits up despite testing for any potential issues, and all of that back-tracking to fix issues and bugs is time consuming.

Bigger businesses have larger compatibility and security concerns when it comes to software upgrades or installations, so it's only natural for it to take longer.

The situation in Sweden right now is that asylum seekers get more money than a Swede who has paid full income tax for 30 years. An asylum seeker with two children will receive 2170 GBP a month with no time limits (and this is pensionable money), I think it sucks, and its offensive to the hardworking ordinary citizen. I am not saying that refugees should be left to fend for themselves but there should never be a circumstance that they get more than a national, that's all.

Why? Because the year before a World Cup he's absolutely going to need to regular playing time to guarantee his chances of being in Brazil. 

There's no CL side Chelsea would sell to in the Prem (unless they swap him for Rooney, which is possible). They won't sell to Tottenham because Jose seems to be turning the knife there. 

What CL teams in Spain can afford his transfer fee? Barca and Madrid are the only two I can think of and I don't think they'll be in for him. Unless Athletico have more money than I realize.

Who else would push for him? PSG? Monaco? Possible. Teams in Italy probably cannot afford him unless its a loan to buy deal.

Additionally, you never know when GD is going to come in to play.

I did some research on the past 10 years of the EPL and on average, 2 positions a year are decided on GD.  We can't afford to take this risk if we are serious about a top 4 spot.

*edit*

Here is the research.  The subreddit style does not like tables though for some reason.

The Time Lords also used bowships, black hole carriers, N-Forms.  The Doctor mentions that all sorts of awful things were unleashed, like ""the Nightmare Child, the Could-Have-Been King with his army of Meanwhiles and Never-Weres"".  He also says that both sides used Time itself as a weapon, reversing defeats and changing the past so that armies fought and fought again.

If you go back to The Runaway Bride, the Doctor mentions that in the really early days, the Time Lords fought people like the Racnoss and a race of vampires (some of which were really outlandishly big), amongst others.  They used to be really good at war, and it's hinted they were pretty ruthless.  They brought The Master back to life, and he's the guy that destroyed a significant fraction of the universe (in Logopolis...no reset buttons were pushed, I think he took out quite a big chunk before the Doctor stopped him).

Also, if you watch Remembrance of the Daleks, it introduces you to The Hand of Omega, which is a tool for turning stars into black holes.  And in Silver Nemesis, you get introduced to a living metal called Validium.  The Time Lords made a statue of the stuff and the Doctor uses it to wipe out a fleet of Cybermen.

I'd have serious doubts about him calling himself a *Doctor Who* writer, if that's the case. Whether it's the revival or the classic series, it's all one show, and someone who has not seen 26 years of the show is not a *Doctor Who* writer.

&gt;just doesnt count them for this list.

And if that's the case, I'd have preferred him to have said that his list is only from 2005 onwards. That would've been a fair representation of his list. If a complete outsider was reading it, they would've thought that *Doctor Who* started in 2005, with some backstory written for the purposes of fleshing out the series.

No, that's nonsense.

People like you simply don't understand what he's saying, you believe whatever biased spin the press feeds you. Anyone who actually listens to what Bloom says and then reads articles like this one from the Telegraph can see that there's a deliberate misrepresentation going on.

In this article it says: ""in 2004, he was accused of encouraging employers to sack pregnant women"".

Yet this is what Bloom actually said: ""no self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age."".

Everyone can see the difference but the Telegraph has chosen to deliberately mislead readers.

The ""Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Führer"" incident is the same, what actually happened and what the press writes are completely different. Martin Schulz was essentially saying that Europe should unite as one country, in German, when Bloom shouted that out. Quite frankly every Briton listening was thinking exactly what Bloom was thinking, he simply had the platform and the guts to say it.

Now I don't blame you for falling for these media tricks, but you really aught to start thinking for yourself a bit more and making sure you have all the facts in place before you start making accusations.

true,egoisillusion,null,null,"Collins was my MOTM for some very important blocks/tackles when Newcastle put on the pressure at the end. Have to feel very good about the whole defense though. When looking at our back four combined with Noble/Diame, they look tricky to break down. Hopefully they can sustain the defensive focus necessary to stay organized game to game. We can't afford any lackadaisical moments near the back. We win (or tie in this case) on intensity and focus. Joey O'Brien had some key tackles and did pretty well against a shifty Ben Arfa. It's going to be hard for Sam to take out a known variable for an unknown variable in Rat.

On offense, while Maiga did a good job winning headers and okay job at hold up play, it's clear we need more of a dynamic threat up top. This is especially true if Nolan has an off game, which he did. Downing had me a little bit concerned at first that there would be a let down from Cardiff, but he pulled out some very dangerous crosses, with one that Nolan certainly should have put on target. I actually would have preferred to see Cole come in for Nolan, since he was having an off day. This is especially true since Cole showed in game 1 that he was more than capable finishing in the middle. In the future, when subbing in Cole, hopefully they look closer at who out of Jarvis/Nolan/Downing is having the worse game.

I believe that Quagliarella will be a decent addition if he does end up coming. While he's not going to impress with blazing pace or shifty moves, he does put the ball in the net. I'd feel much better about him in poaching opportunities than I would Maiga. I just want Carroll to be fit already.

Yet this is what Bloom actually said: ""no self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age."".
Everyone can see the difference but the Telegraph has chosen to deliberately mislead readers.

I don't see a difference. 

&gt;The ""Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Führer"" incident is the same, what actually happened and what the press writes are completely different. Martin Schulz was essentially saying that Europe should unite as one country, in German, when Bloom shouted that out. Quite frankly every Briton listening was thinking exactly what Bloom was thinking, he simply had the platform and the guts to say it.

A lot of Britons were thinking it in the way when some people see a fat person fall over they want to point and laugh but have the common decency to keep such childish outbursts in their heads.

I'm fully aware of these quotes and I am thinking for myself. It just so happens that my interpretations and various newspapers interpretations match up. You do realise that the reasons Bloom is despicable are not limited to those two quotes? I'm hesitant to use Wikipedia but there is a nice list of [reasons here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Bloom). And yes, avoid anything which doesn't have a citation mark. 

I do think that UKIP should be criticised on things which they've actually done or actually stand for and not on speculation and hysteria and those two quotes as well as a whole host of other things are worth criticising them on.

Gerrard's brilliant, but Lucas has been a bit off lately. We could do with another CDM to make Lucas preform better, or even splash out on a world class CDM. 

Coutinho is great, but not on the left wing. We really need someone in that position so Coutinho could play centrally.

Aspas won't be starting once Suarez is back, so there's no need to get another CF. Aspas is a good backup.

Henderson is good, but he's not amazing. Not yet. Neither is Allen, so we need someone else, like Willian or Mickey.

Sturridge is perfect.

(e.g one could easily skew data by hosting a series of raids on select known clubs which have dealt drugs that just happen to appeal to the music tastes of afro caribbean community).

* Buy Turan for £20M (we need a LW and I can't think of anyone better that I know for sure would come and he'd definitely give 100%)

* Buy Ilori for £6M (we obviously need CB coverage and I don't think Sakho is feasible unless Skrtel or Agger were to leave as he wants playing time)

I'd happily take a point. But if we play like we did against Stoke and they have an off day I can see us napping 3. I wouldn't be too disappointed if we lost, as long as we played well. Yes it's against Man U, and I hate their guts, but let's face it, we shouldn't expect to win that. Although having said that...Moyes' first NW derby, and thinking back to how well we played against them last year....anything is possible.

&gt; Swansea away

Toughest of the rest of them imo. Good team, although got ripped to shreds by Man U. Assuming we play well it shouldn't be too difficult. Would be very upset if we lost. Honestly should be 3 points.

&gt; Southampton home

They've played decently but they're a mid-table team we should be beating no problem. Should be 3 points.

&gt; Palace home

My local team and my brother supports them, but honestly we should be annihilating palace. They'll probably be relegated this season. Dropping points against them at home is completely unacceptable. 

&gt; Newcastle away

Can be a tricky fixture at times but they've not looked great so far this year. Should be 3 points. Especially after last year (and the closed door friendly at the end of pre-season).

So...

Anything less than 14/18 I'll be very upset. Really should be a minimum of 15/18, and being optimistic, I'd like to think we can get 17/18.

Also - we'll have Suarez back for Sunderland onwards (and possibly Southampton, assuming we beat Notts Co. - I believe?), which will be great. 

I think the key is momentum. If we can keep a winning streak, they'll get easier and easier. Obviously the Man U game is critical. If we can at least stay unbeaten, then we can go into the rest of the games with a lot of confidence. If we can beat them...well then I can honestly seeing us having 24/24 and being serious contenders for top 4 if not higher.

Maybe Disney needs to team with the BBC and give us an animated series of 10 running around.  I'm sure David would be happy to do the voicework and earlier Doctors can easily show up with voice work instead of having to make appearances.

One of the lines in the article is similar to one of my favourite little remarks to make... At what point do you draw the line in the trade-off between security and civil liberties?

The tragedy is that there isn't an answer and when there's an outcry over perceived 'failings' by a government organisation, red tape is unwound. When everything has a standard operating procedure and officials have been entirely transformed into worker drones banned from using sense; we'll have a safe world, but it'll resemble something very Orwellian. It won't matter what political party is in power, it's equally likely to be either.

Emotive incidents like the Soham murders will always be used to add weight to the ""increase safety"" argument (PND being a good thing to come from the system).

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work the other way around as effectively, the best I can come up with first hand is the bloke who's address is linked to a criminal who gave the address when lying to police.

The player we sign needs to be somebody a little older, who can change out in the wide position and cover the #10 for about 40% of the season. This is why Willian was referred to as perfect.

This is also the problem when fans speak of the team as a first 11. The season is won or lost with squads.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"Exactly. It works in a team like West Ham who play a rigid formation with roles, a lot of containment and a direct style of counterattacking football where the defensive midfielder can loft the ball out wide.

If you watch what we do, Lucas is the starting point in almost every build up play. He sits between the centerbacks and has 6 passing options. Gerrard is just a little ahead of him to provide the extra passing channels and whoever is the #10 in that play is just a little more ahead of him with his back to the goal. 

Lucas made 77 passes this morning, the next most was Gerrard at 70 and then Agger at 62. All the other players were in the 40's and 30's. Lucas also passed at 91% success rate. Defensively Lucas and Gerrard split the duties - 5 tackles and 3 interceptions for Lucas while 4 tackles and 5 interceptions for Gerrard. 

These guys are splitting the role - very fluid, you have to be able to get back into position, press, dispatch and then make the quick decision on change of posession. When it is played out of the back with Mignolet or Agger one of either Gerrard or Lucas (more often) steps back. 

Contrast this with Diame. He made **24 passes** last night at a success rate of **74%**. *completely different style of player*. In that team Diame breaks up but it is Noble (60 passes at 82% - a lot of long balls) who does the distirbution.

And it isn't just that part of the Liverpool side that is fluid, the wide players are like that with the playmaker role, and the front three between themselves are like that, and there are a lot of moments where Sturridge drops deep to provide the extra man (drawing out a centerback to provide space for whoever is wide).

CM is the position where we are most stacked. We have 4 players who can each play there and provide the role Rodgers wants (albeit some better than others). We need to fill in the spot Henderson is currently playing out of position in. We also need more than 3 healthy centerbacks (one of whom cannot play in this system).

People complain that Lucas and Gerrard looked bad in the last 30 minutes but they were not. In our system defense and breaking up after a change of possession starts from the very front - Sturridge, Aspas, Henderson. Gerrard and Lucas were outnumbered and the instinct is to fall back and anticipate the next move. They had far, far too much space.

We simply don't have the bench to reinforce the front in the final 30 minutes. Aspas, Coutinho and Henderson had to come off but we reinforced with more defense and midfield rather with more defending and possession from the front.

To add depth to this and make it last 90 minutes for 50 games the answers are not Diame, Eriksen and Papa - far from it. 

It really is time to call and end to the thread about Diame and a ""backup DM"". I'm going to say this in the nicest way possible without causing any offense to anybody, but it really isn't like in a video game where if your DM gets to 62% of energy in the 70th minute you replace him with a 'backup' ",0,1377408069,null,0,1377408455,0,cbuu5ne,t3_1l15h5,t1_cbuu5ne,t1_cbus6k0,null,1429708406,18,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,18

Anything more is a bonus- though my subconscious says we'd need those bonuses for our top-4 ambitions.

Guess what the score of the game will be in a reply to this comment.

I will post the winner(s) in the Post-Match Thread.

If you get the score right, you get a point. I'll make a league throughout the season.

**You can reply up until 19:59:59 on the 26/8/2013. I will not be accepting edited comments.**

My small flat is not nice in the winter, but I can 't do anything about that until I have a higher and more stable income. One month last winter it cost £125 to heat it, which is outrageous.

It hasn't been a great year man wise.

There are a couple of interesting prospects, but if I were really that bothered, I would have done more about them by now. Plus one of them is my height and I had to bend down to kiss him the last time I saw him; not sure I can get over that, I much prefer tall men. He is rather lovely, that aside. Hmm, I wonder if he's going tonight. I don't think I am going to go though.

I'm going to be spending time with one of my favourite friends in Dublin soon, so I am really looking forward to that. He'll also be in London for a while so we'll get a good amount of time together. He's had a rough year so making him laugh lots is the plan (we're scattering his mother's ashes in Dublin, she died a painful slow death from cancer in March).

Oh yeah, he told her six times. Even when I had to run home from a night out because she was really worried. She had a arrhythmic heart-beat for 45 minutes, anything after 5 minutes is in the 'oh shit' category. She told him. He did nothing.

My girlfriend has the same issue my mom does... different doctor, same response. She passed out at work due to it around a year a go now. He wouldn't even look her in the face in the hospital when she was there, he knew he fucked up and then when the tests all came back ""negative"" we knew it was time to just fuck that noise. We're trying to find a better doctor but they all seem to be such quacks, such wastes of time.

true,bairy,uk,Birmingham,"tl;dr: emotion trumps logic, fear trumps joy, most people willingly pay for additional evidence for what they currently believe, whether what they believe is true or not.

To explain a bit more about why bad news sells better..

Fear is the most powerful emotion that sticks in our memories the most whereas joy tends to fade quickly. This ties into the idea that time flies when you're having fun, and time drags when you aren't.

If you go on 10 great dates and 1 horrible date, the horrible one is the one you will remember in the most detail, and for all future dates you will be worried about this one going wrong, even though odds are well in your favour. Same with flights, bus rides, isolated crime waves in a certain area etc.

You'll notice that newspapers in particular play purely on emotion. Use the right wording and you can bypass the logic part of someone's brain and head directly to the emotion section.

Take health and safety. There are very frequent stories about ""jobsworths"" and ""health and safety gone mad"". Most of the time these stories are practically made up, or exaggerated so much that they might as well have been made up, and just doing 30 seconds of research would prove that. So instead, papers get people to pose with a sadface, they use language that points out how some child was a victim of this decision and how sad that child now is.

Suddenly the reader doesn't want to research, they're too angry.

Now repeat this frequently. Run two such stories a week. People get addicted to it. They want the next installment of how terrible health and safety rules are, which backs up what they already know. Same with crime, immigration, public services.

Papers print what people buy, and people buy fear.

Okay so what if there was more good news? Wouldn't buy that daily for the warm fuzzy feeling? I'll answer that by quoting some stats:

/r/worldnews - current front page is most/all bad news: 3.86m subs

I don't really think there's much pressure on us: there's no shame in losing at Old Trafford so anything is a bonus, while for Moyes this is very important, his first match in charge in front of the home crowd, let's hope they choke.

I'd like to see Romelu start though I get a nasty feeling it'll be Torres. Even so, with our attacking talent we should cause them a lot of problems. I could see our us starting with:

                 Cech 
       Brana  Cahill  JT  Cole
          Ramires  Lampard
      De Bruyne  Oscar  Hazard
                Torres  

Get a feeling that Mata will be benched. Didn't look very good vs Villa whereas Dr Bruyne fitted in well vs Hull. Schurrle's looked great so far but his best position is on the left and I don't see Jose moving Hazard away and he certainly won't be dropped, so Andre will probably only get a stint off the bench again.

A thorough grounding in Shakespeare and the works of Tolstoy is no damn use to a kid whose dad is a motor mechanic, and he's destined to take over the family business.

Neither is it about money. There are far too many kids running up lifetime debts because they are told ""you must go to university"", even if they end up studying some worthless Arts degree and wouldn't know a Manet from a Monet if it infected them with syphilis.

Intellectually bright kids go to uni, the others learn valuable trades and skills, you know, the ones all the employers are crying out for.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"And I am saying that the a test which identifies which kids had their parents spend the most money on them for the 3 weeks preceeding a test at age eleven, does not determine that. At all.

It just lets us know who the richest kids are, and who has the most involved/pushiest parents, not the most intellectually bright.

My comparison to the common entrance exam is because the common entrance exam basically IS the 11+, which is rarely in effect elsewhere  outside of Kent. Were I to live in Kent I would use that as an example, because I know from my sister who teaches that that is the case there as well.

I am using it to indicate that these tests in no way determine which kids are the most academically able, and which have the most potential to do well at that type of school.

All they determine is that their parents were able to obsessively cram them with expensive tutors in the run up to the test.

I really fail to see how having good vocational training demands we assign kids their entire lives at the age of 11, based on a system of testing that tells us virtually nothing about either them, or their potential.

Surely we could just, yknow, have good vocational training available. Its incredibly popular where it is available.  

EDIT: Remember that what we can test of an 11 year old is very limited. You can't look for genuine insight, or a spark of originality, or for any kind of genuine ability or flair, or for long term retention, or the ability to make connections. You are just looking at the ability to rote memorise.  That means that cramming gives you everything you need. A dumb kid can have their head packed with with stuff intensely for 3 weeks and go and massively outperform an incredibly smart kid who didn't have that chance. 

And if this is a state school system, then parents would be looking at the choice between spending £5000-£10,000 for tutors now, or £150,000 for a private education. Its a no brainer, and brings it into the affordability range of the middle class, leaving poorer kids totally locked out.

There is no way parents are NOT going to use tutors, and any test of this type is simply a measure of which kids have been tutored and which haven't, not their actual ability.

Now obviously there will be some very stupid kids, and some very bright kids, who will end up in the right place regardless.

true,madeinacton,null,null,"I'll have a crack at convincing you why I've made my decision to vote Lib Dems again. 

Firstly I choose the party based on their underlying beliefs, which are generally similar to what I believe. 

They are pro green energy, believe that education should accessible and ideally free, income distribution should be utilised to help the poorest, are willing to take tough decisions (i.e cuts) if needed but not out of ideology, a science based drugs policy among many other things such as believing that we should stay in the EU and play a part in shaping it ect. They are also socially progressive in areas such as human rights, equality ect.  

No party in power has ever made all the correct decisions and kept to everything that is in their manifesto and the Lib Dem's are no exception, but the areas they have pushed for and been able influence since they have been in power (not Tory policies they have voted in line with) have all been things that I agree with and am glad they have pursued.  The biggest one being raising the tax band to 10k. I hope that if they were to get in again they would try to further increase this to full time minimum wage. 

Secondly I think they have been relatively mature and pragmatic. They are a minority partner, so it is expected that they will have the minority of say in policies going through and what they can influence. Yet it seems that anything good they do is credited towards the Tories and anything bad that the Tories do is blamed on them for being part of the coalition. If they had refused the coalition, it would have left a minority Tory party which would have collapsed and likely got a landslide in another election. They have effectively allowed themselves to get politically slaughtered in the polls in order to help the country and attempt to make changes they campaigned on and believe in, which I admire them for.  Labour on the other hand preferred to not take a coalition with them, in order to give themselves time to regroup and and take a politically strategic break, which was cowardly.

Ah, sorry, the top 1% pay 30% ... then the next 49% pay a further 80% ... and the remaining 50% make up the 10% shortfall. I must have been confused with the US, where the income disparity (and the tax paid) is so much more skewed.

Still my point stands. In terms of the amount going into the coffers by each income group, if you take away that 1%, that's 30% of your budget GONE. Who's going to make up the difference ? Not the bottom 50% for sure, they're already struggling as it is. So it'll fall on the 49%, who are basically going to be penalized for being ""successful, but not quite successful enough to up sticks and move all their assets to Switzerland or Monaco"".

No, not really. That would be a generalisation too far. What I believe is that there's a strong case to be made for sections of the media aimed at them being politically manipulative and skewing political debate in ways that benefit the right wing, without also benefiting working people, by creating fears and then playing on them.

The left is trying to counter that with reasonable arguments based on altruism, and that doesn't engage a majority of people.

What won the first election for Blair was the notion that 'Tory sleaze' was entrenched, which *did* resonate with people. A more ruthless Labour leader than Miliband would almost certainly be able to make something of the 'sleaze' that the current crop of Tories have already displayed.

Funny that, I took the 11 plus, and don't remember a home tutor. Anyway, the fact that SOME parents may have tried to get a leg-up with money and extra tuition doesn't make the principle behind the system INVALID !

Not all kids are the same, and trying to pretend they are to achieve some PC ideal is not helping them one iota. You have to be realistic, not every kid will be academically skilled to go to Uni, and not every kid will have the skills to strip down and rebuild a tractor in 30 minutes.

Give them what they NEED, not what you think they need !

&gt; Surely we could just, yknow, have good vocational training available.

Yeah, we used to. It was called the CSE track, and turned out generations of skilled workers the country needed. But someone thought they knew better, merged the tracks into the GCSE, ensured you get a passing mark for turning up and spelling your name right, no one fails, no one excels, and we created a generation of robots with no skills whatsoever. And then the SAME idiots who made the first mistake suggested the only way to fix is was for EVERY kid to go to Uni, because having an Minor Arts degree in Sociology is really a selling point on your CV when you want to become a plumber.

Sorry, I've lived through the Winter of Discontent, the Thatcher years, and all the other shit since, and every single educational policy since the early 90s has watered down our system, has avoided recognizing that kids are different and have different abilities, and consigned a generation of potential plumbers and builders to a lifetime of debt, a worthless degree and no jobs because they were never taught the skills they actually needed.

interestingly it is the daily telegraph, a paper mainly read by the older generations of pensioners and baby boomers that is whipping up,a frenzy about building anywhwere, whilst its readers enjoyed massive building projects with upwards to 400,000 homes built at peaks in but regularly 300,000 build every year of the 50's 60's and 70's tailing off in the mid 80s and slowing to a crawl in the 80s and collapsed building 2007 onwards.
this allowed telegraph readers to live in homes larger than modern standards, built on englands green fields! at a a much more affordable and cheaper rate than comparable homes to today.
they also had the benefit of social housing.

Build away, its the right thing to do, there is so much green belt we could build for years and still have plenty left over, its just scar mongering to prevent loss of house price inflation in old homes owned by older owners previously built on what would be todays green belt.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt;You have to be realistic, not every kid will be academically skilled to go to Uni, and not every kid will have the skills to strip down and rebuild a tractor in 30 minutes.

Absolutely, lets determine that with that a system that identifies which kids those are.

As someone who teaches this type of test, trust me, it does not do that in the slightest.

I'm not disagreeing with your point that there is an absence of good vocational education to begin with.

I am saying that a standardised test at age 11 is a horrendous way to determine which kids that is suited for. Especially now the private tuition market has exploded. Its both more advanced and more ubiquitous than it was a few decades ago, and anywhere you find 11 plus exams now, you find intense tutoring for it.

The lack of plumbers came about because of a lack of funding, and general supply, for training for vocational skills. Not because of a lack of kids wanting to be plumbers. 

Just to add, however, our university graduation rates are not particularly high for any western nation, and severely lag behind a few. Arts degrees, though not creative arts degree, also still add a salary premium over the course of a person's whole career. Meanwhile the correlation between the benefit to the economy as a whole and the tax intake is pretty undeniable.

Forcing kids out of the potential to go to university at a young age, or indeed to do a trade at a young age, based on irrelevant criteria, is really not a prerequisite to funding strong, industry led, vocational training. 

What happened wasn't the comprehensive system. What happened is that businesses stopped training people. Kids going to secondary moderns weren't going straight into a job as a plumber. It was NOT the CSE track that was training them to do that.

They were getting an apprenticeship and training after leaving school. Then busineses stopped offering them, and the government stopped funding them, and started funding some other, frankly abysmal vocational schemes, and by 1990 we had lost 200,000 apprenticeships

We don't need the secondary moderns to get that standard of vocational training back. The idea that it was comprehensives that destroyed it is a misunderstanding of the historical process by which is declined.  We could bring back grammars and secondary moderns today, and it would change nothing, because that wasn't the actual causative factor.They happened had the same time, but they were only tangentially related.

So 30% not 90%, quite a leap?

&gt;Still my point stands.

Really?

&gt;A hell of a lot better then dis-incentivizing (not sure if that's actually a word) people to be successful.

So long as you are not fixing a maximum income, there's sill a notional financial incentive to work, assuming people do work purely for financial incentives (which is actually ludicrous for anything other than piece work in a factory or something equally soul destroying).

&gt;Am I correct in thinking that you are of the anarchistic persuasion ?

I guess, although I'm generally viewed as a bit of a reactionary leftie, since I'm not a communist.

&gt; i.e. property is theft, money means nothing, and there should be no law and no government ?

Property is robbery.  Money is a bit of a game, but sometimes a useful one, and always an interesting one.  State law serves the State and those the State serves, I'm not against community-delivered communal law, bottom-up policing, distributive and restorative justice, etc..

&gt;If so, kindly PM me with your address, I'll come over later and nick your PC, and anything else that might sully your misguided ethos.

You clearly still don't know what property is, do you?  Or at least what every important anarchist, socialist and communist thinker ever meant by property... I'd be all arrogant and nasty, but seriously, the propaganda against anarchism is so heavy, even here where several anarchists are actively debunking this shit every day it still crops up so often it's obvious how powerful the education and media system's deliberate mis-communication of basic philosophy is.  Okay so...

When I or any other leftie says property is theft, it doesn't mean I want your computer, nor your mobile phone, your deodorant or your toothbrush, nor does it even mean I want your house - particularly - even if it has 10 bedrooms.  In that last case, it might be a _bit_ different if people are dying from exposure, but let's assume in anarchist UK that people are generally safely housed.  What we're talking about is _private property_, that is ownership of shit you don't use personally, that you have other other people use and protect for you,and that you use to exploit other people (employees).  We might say your factory or agribusiness is theft, certainly your bank is and your corporate investments are null and void.",0,1377434780,null,0,1377435067,0,cbuy6hb,t3_1l0va4,t1_cbuy6hb,t1_cbuxvpg,null,1429706529,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

This isn't ITK and I'm not sure if I'm meant to speak to the mods before posting, but I guess I'm about to find out.

&gt;I've just left a photoshoot with Sergio Ramos in Madrid and as it does during the course of the day conversation turned to football and the players that Real had recruited this summer. I said 'you guys better stay away from Bale' to which he replied something along the lines of 'No. This is already done, he's coming next week'. **I questioned if this was true and he said it's what they've been told and he hopes Ronaldo is ok with it followed by a smile and raised eyebrow.**

&gt;This doesn't mean it's fact and I'm purely sharing as some may find it of interest, so make of it what you will. Salt and all that...

 This is exactly why you don't go around buying all the best players just because you can. Maybe related to Bale, maybe not... I'd bet good money it is at least somewhat related.

Here is my actual opinion for what it is worth. The left wing ideologues hold no authority on morality. Nor do they have a special dispensation for defending our freedoms. They simply hold a different viewpoint from right wing ideologues - both sides are after the same thing. Both care about our freedoms and both want what is best for our society.

You are not the moral arbiters of society. You are no better (or worse) than right wingers. Get over yourselves.",0,1377436372,null,0,false,0,cbuyfxc,t3_1l0v1v,t1_cbuyfxc,t1_cbuyczc,null,1429706408,-6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-6

However, there is a slight concern that IF it becomes entirely straightforward to use this space, which is more desirable, then there will never be any incentive to build on the brownfield sites we have ready to build upon.

We really want to get that shit used. There's lots of it, and it wouldn't take that much more work, or be that much less profitable. But they will never build on it if there is greenfield sites which are just as easy to use.

Of course, as you indicate, we are in a desperate state in terms of housing in this country, so some emergency measures are easily worth some green sites. And the fact councils still have a say over where this happens is a seriously big protection. This isn't the man coming in and stomping over the poor villagers without their say so.

I have to be honest, this

&gt;But in total, the CPRE found that 150,464 houses are planned for green-belt sites, compared with just over 81,000 when the same exercise was conducted in August last year

Just sounds great. That's 70,000 new homes being built more than the previous year. Thats homes, that people can build their lives in, have kids in. 

&gt;If all the 150,000 properties mentioned in the CPRE’s report were built, the lost green belt would amount to an area totalling 21.61 square miles.

For reference, the total Green Belt land in England in 2010 was circa 6330 square miles.

At my job I spend close to a third of my working hours doing nothing, even after asking for more work multiple times and making my own work whenever possible (I have a relatively low level job, I am given work), and another third doing work that doesn't need to be done and has been created to keep me busy. 

Why do I need to be there for so many hours if there isn't enough work for me? Because I need the money to pay for food and shelter, unemployment is high for my age, it's a job.

Now how many other people are there in the same situation?

He reminds me a bit of Harry, and although Harry's fucking around for months when he thought he was going to be the England coach completely influences my opinion of him he has always seemed to get results throughout his career.

Exactly, what they SHOULD have done, if they wanted to hold him, is hold him for suspicion of that offence at the border.

That would have been totally legitimate and legal.

However, it would have given them VASTLY less power over him than Section 7. They couldn't have compelled him to answer questions, they couldn't have asked whatever they felt like, and they would have had to give him a definite charge.

I don't really understand how both the police and the politicians seem to have come to the belief that laws relating to carrying material likely to be of use to a terrorist is covered under Section 7. It very clearly is not. Section 7 is very explicit in appropriate targets, and did not include suspects of that nature.

Thinking about it from RM's POV is as useless as explaining why chelsea went for Willian. They will find a role for Bale and, while he won't impact them as much as he impacted our team, he will give Barca some headaches with his speed and shooting, and he will definitely help them against Man City, Bayern, etc going into the spring in CL play.

true,bcash,null,null,"All that is true, but it's also worth remembering two points:

* The responsible disclosure of such secrets.  Nothing that has come out of the Guardian has disclosed names, places, etc.  The only 'leak' that perhaps did was [the one via the Independent that didn't come from Snowdon.](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/23/uk-government-independent-military-base) Which, given the way the debate is turning, looks more-and-more like a inside plant to colour the debate a certain way.

* The fact that those documents had already been leaked and duplicated.  The Guardian/David Miranda incidents were never going to 'recover data', it's been redundantly copied to many places across the globe.  Not that this neutralises the argument that they shouldn't have the data in the first place, but does shed light on the intentions of the security services: it was more about finding out what journalists knew, and as a show of strength, than it was to protect genuinely sensitive information.

So yes, I imagine there are genuine state secrets that must be kept secret at all times.  But we have to trust the state machinery that this really is absolutely vital information; and the trouble so far is that we now 100% know that, in addition to genuine secrets - stuff that could put lives in danger - they also regard high-level operational descriptions as secret.  This is particularly infuriating as when the thing they describe is arguably illegal, and definitely not in the wider public interest.

Finally: if this data is so secret, why did a low-level system administrator like Snowden have access to it anyway.  We're talking about an agency who wants to catalogue everything about everyone, and wants us to believe that is can be trusted with such data and that it won't be misused.  Yet, they can't even protect their own sensitive data against their own employees.

In short: we can trust the state with secrets when they show they can be trusted with secrets.  And by god they're not there yet.  Not even close.",0,1377442093,null,0,false,0,cbuzo4i,t3_1l1yc1,t1_cbuzo4i,t1_cbuzbie,null,1429705817,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

As a kiddywink, I had no compunction in picking up and playing with (read: tearing the legs off...(I'm a bad person)) *all the* creepy crawlies.

However one day whilst living in shared accommodation where the neighbour did not give a shit about the communal passageway, I decided to clean said passageway due to all the webs, muck and shit with a liberal bleaching and mopping session.

After my 'mission' I decided it was time for a well earn't 'cuppa and, upon sitting down and relaxing I felt an ever so slight scratch on the back of my neck.

&gt;Again. Scratch, scratch - wtf is that....

and is where I'm sure most of you will not only be calling BS, but, is where I got bit by a common house spider on the back of the neck and left two clear puncture wounds (according to the ex) and a *massive* splatted spider in my hand. And....I actually rung the NHS Direct line after I started feeling all woozy and got told to put vinegar on it since they ~~(obviously didn't believe me)~~ had no idea what to do.

Did you not see the result of the Bradley/Chelsea Manning trial? It is quite clear that the government are just using the law to make an example of whistle blowers to prevent any more emerging in the future, rather than trying debate what and what not is in the public interest.

Another collab with [my](https://www.facebook.com/mLARAart) friend [Omega Man 5000](https://www.facebook.com/OmegaMan5k) is on [Teefury.com](http://www.teefury.com) today. Enjoy it just for the art, or you can grab it on a shirt if you wanna.  I've been posting them as each one pops up, and this is the final main one in our little companion pin up series, so I thought some of you may be interested!  Again, sorry for the self-promotion, but as some people have been interested in the others, I thought I better post it! :D

We may do others in the future (Captain Jack, Rory, Idris, Sarah Jane, etc.) but we're taking on a break on them for now (don't want to OD on Who--don't know if it's possible.. but don't want to find out).  Hope you've enjoyed all of them!! :D  If you recognize me, then you may know that Rose is one of my favourites of all time (2nd after Donna), so we really tried to pack a lot of (especially Season 1) goodness into this!  

My favourite parts are actually the gas mask and the [banana](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Banana). :3 Hope everyone likes it!

Season 5: Mostly a reboot of tone in story but there are a few little nods to the past. More of a focus on adventure, sci-fi, and humor. The tone has a dark fantasy thing going, similar to the latter Patter films.

Most will tell you to start with season 1 but it depends on how much each one will interest you. Each has it's pros and cons but if you can roll with the bad times, its much better to watch it in order as long as you can accept a different style in season 5. 

As for Classic Who, just ignore for it now. The reboot does a good job at explaining everything as they re-introduce it. You won't miss anything at all. Once you finish the new series, if you have a curiosity for it, you can mostly watch in any order but focus on the modern series for now.

Lloris: Excellent. What else is new.

Dawson: Great defensively. Stop playing that diagonal all the time. It is beautiful when it comes off but it doesn't always do.

Vertonghen: What a man. What a man. What a mighty good man.

Danny: Continues to improve. I am thoroughly excited.

Capoue: A titan on the field. He is enormous. Oh, you're going to foul me. Like I give a fuck.

Dembele: Great dribbling. Avoids tackles per usual. Closing down well. I  would like to see more slicing passing.

Paulinho: I was still itching for more from him after the first game. He played well in Georgia. This game he is really clicking on all cylinders. Definitely proving his worth.

Chadli: When he was seeing a lot of the ball from about minute 5-20 he was great. He has disappeared a bit lately. Love that he has no problem defending.

Soldado: Come on lads. He is bored.

Townsend: Better than Siggy. The pace, confidence, dribbling skill, and hunger to impress make up for everything that he stills struggles with. He deserve to really get a run at it this season.

I am happy with how the team is playing. Just need to start getting those few more forward passes in the middle of the park going and swansea is in for a treat.

Would just like to note that the Swans had more possession than United had last weekend and we are clearly the stronger in possession this match. That goes to show how we will match up against United some this year. We can really boss a midfield.

Your other two points are frankly ridiculous. Blair's government devolved more power to local governments than probably any other - there is no evidence that it undermined local democracy. As for 'destroying workers' rights', I can't find any evidence for that either. I'd say that instituting the first ever minimum wage and implementing the EU Working Time Directive gives them a pretty good record on that score. 

At the end of the day, however bad you consider New Labour to have been, you must concede that a Conservative government would have been far worse. And that was the only alternative - a 'true' leftist government isn't, and never has been, an option.

Edit to address your own edits: 

As I said, I opposed Blair's foreign policy and authoritarian tendencies as much as anyone. I maintain that both would have been worse under a Tory PM. As for selling out the unions, he had no choice. Clause Four had to go, it was completely outdated and had no public support whatsoever.

sorry still in prematch mode there.

Well, we outplayed Swansea all game. Capoue and Paulinho looked so damn hot. Townsend had some highlight worthy runs, but needs to work on his anticipation, just the timing of his passes, really. Could be a superstar.

Chadli was very solid. Worries me when he comes inside so much, would rather we kept our width. But pleased. Soldado was decent. His performance was summed up by his pen and that beautiful holding of the ball vs Ashley Williams. Brilliant when he got the ball, but didn't get on it much, we had trouble feeding him.

Defence was very solid. Rose looked much better this game, less erratic going forward, but still a bit of a weak link. If Bale is going, I'd like to see someone brought in, honestly.

That's about it. I was sorry Dembele was so quiet, but we now have a midfield of superstars. He's also getting used to a new role. Nice run out for JD and Siggy who looked involved.

I'm actually reading a book and doing exercises myself, the psychologist woman had a look at the book and said its great, and the concepts and exercises are pretty much standard. 

Feeling Good : The New Mood Therapy by Dr Burns.

It was one of the first pioneering books on CBT apparently. I just looked for the top rated book on CBT and bought it. I bought it last year but having a glance through I kinda dismissed it as self help nonsense, especially seeing exercises to do, and it sat on the shelf til recently when I started seeing the psychologist and she gave me some mood worksheets. Forgot to do them, but picked up the book and started reading, and started doing the exercises.

It's actually really simple, the core aspects of CBT and training your mind to recognise the negative thoughts and whatnot, then to apply the method of rationalising them and seeing how the initial thought is full of cognitive distortions such as all-or-nothing thinking or jumping to conclusions.

The basic theory is that your thoughts are what control your emotions, not the other way around. So once you can control or interpret your thoughts in a certain way then your emotions will change.

I couldn't recommend it enough, even though I'm only a little way in. It might sound silly or hopeless, especially writing down things as exercises, but once you start doing them it kinda makes sense and you can genuinely feel it working.

I think it's very much part of how AVB sets up his teams. We look very solid but we don't create many chances. The irony is that if we had George Graham in charge he'd be lambasted for playing boring but effective football, but because it's a young, foreign coach he gets an easier ride. That's not me slagging off AVB, because I like him; but there's no denying that we don't play particularly inventive, attacking football. We've got lots of solid, destructive players in the middle of the park and we've got great pace on the wings, but there's very little subtlety or invention. Last season for goals we were dependent on either Defoe finding half a yard of space (first half of the season) or Bale producing something magical from outside of the box (second half of last season). His choice of striker seems emblematic of this. In the past we had Berbatov or Keane or Defoe. Now we have Soldado, who is effective but hardly likely to go past a man or spot a pass or link-up brilliantly - he's a good striker but he seems to be basically a slightly better version of Darren Bent. 

As I said, I like AVB and I think he did well with what he had last season. He inherited Harry's squad but lost Modric and VDV and had to make do with Siggurdson and Dempsey instead. He made us more solid and less flashy. But now that he's spent a fuckload of money on his own players, I'd like to see a bit more subtlety. Something struck me last season: I barely remember a team goal. Lots of great individual goals, but very few goals that involved the whole team.

I'd rather see us play 2 strikers on top, or a 4-3-3.  We have the pace and crossing ability from our wing backs to deliver service.  At times we were just a couple bodies short in the box.

Dembele looked off.  Fatigue?  Too many new players?  I hope he gets a rest on Thursday.  In fact, I hope a few more get a bit of a break.  Its early on, they aren't in the mid-season fitness yet.

Defense got rattled a bit.  But Daws and SuperJan put up great performances.  We got caught out with midfield pressing forward a few tunes, and we bunkered in a bit after the goal.  Had we kept up some consistent pressure, and left Capoue and Dembele to CDM, we could have kept the high line and forced another goal.

I honestly wish he was a bit faster (c'mon minor complaint) 

both young, both really really good players at the moment so no need to wait and they're hard as nails (not necessarily the best reasoning for buying them but i honestly love 'this player is so hard...' jokes) but as far as i remember Yarmo played on the right wing and Kono on the left? hard to pick one, id prefer Kono but will pray for both.

Jose was answering a question about Rooney. I believe the question was specifically about how confident Jose was that we'll sign Rooney.

So the statement ""Maybe I can persuade the player to stay, or the player persuade us to sell"" was just an attempt to explain the two possible outcomes in the Rooney case. ""I"" refers to Man U management and ""the player"" here is Rooney.


The first part of the statement: ""We told [Barcelona] immediately David Luiz was not for sale"" was an attempt to explain that ultimately, the club has the final say.

I love Dorian Gray - that ending is nightmare material. I was re-reading Tom Stoppard's *The Invention of Love* recently and big bonking butch Oscar gets a great cameo appearance. It's about homosexuality during Wilde's time and a fair bit of the play centres around the  Labouchere amendment. Really  great play.

What I've been reading:



*  *Nothing Like the Sun* by Anthony Burgess - it's a fictional account of Shakespeare's life. If you've ever read *A Clockwork Orange* you'll know how good he is with slang and creative language. Well here he's written in a mixture of Elizabethan English and Joycean stream of consciousness ( Burgess wrote a lot of criticism on Joyce and *Nothing Like the Sun* is heavily based on the *Scylla and Charybdis* episode of *Ulysses*). So yeah, it's good shit.  

* *White Nights* by Dostoevsky - Solid short story about love, dreaming and alienation. Very few authors can capture people in the way he can [(as David Foster Wallace says)]  (http://bookhaven.stanford.edu/2013/04/david-foster-wallace-dostoevsky-wasnt-just-a-genius-he-was-finally-brave). One day I need to get around to reading *The Brothers Karamazov*.

* *On the Road* by Jack Kerouac - It's alright. I'm not really a fan of the beat generation, but I can see it's appeal. I'm not that far into it, so it'll probably pick up as I go along.

* *Within a Budding Grove* (A.K.A. *In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower*) by Marcel Proust. I can't possibly describe it. Suffice to say it's incredibly bloody good.

Here's a list of my favourite short story collections, depending upon your taste.

[*A Blink of the Screen* by Terry Pratchett](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13536811-a-blink-of-the-screen) - mostly humourous fantasy, a little light sci-fi thrown in.

[*Tales of the Unexpected* by Roald Dahl](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/394689.Tales_of_the_Unexpected), or any of his other short story collections; definitely not for children!

[*The Happy Prince and Other Tales* by Oscar Wilde](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/779021.The_Happy_Prince_and_Other_Tales) - allegorical fairy tales.

[*The Complete Sherlock Holmes* by Arthur Conan Doyle](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/188572.The_Complete_Sherlock_Holmes) - they've stood the test of time and been adapted so much for good reason, and all but four of the stories are, in fact, shorter fiction; the four novels aren't particularly long either.

Shut down your computer and have somewhere away from it to read, even if it's just the other side of the same room. *Make* time to read: schedule it in like a doctor's appointment or an exam. Also, read junk. Read whatever you really enjoy, however trashy. And reward yourself for reading: I make myself a hot drink and possibly grab some biscuits, but whatever works to make the whole experience pleasant.

Fifteen to twenty pages at one stretch is about right actually, to pause and reflect on what you're reading. Take a drink. Relax. Shift position. Take a note of whatever thought pushed you out of the book, so you can expand on it later. Then you go back into it again. If you feel like a failure every time you stop, then you're basically punishing yourself for reading at all. Stopping is natural: brains need time to absorb new things and learning new stuff is tiring. Reward yourself, and go on to the next chunk.

I've seen people lately claiming that Lamela is more or a central attacker, even though he plays on the wing often at Roma.  Because we don't seem to currently have a proper 10, I put him there.  I think Townsend has earned the right flank with his last couple performances, he's been very dangerous both times.  Chadli as the other winger, doesn't have muhc competition it seems.

Rose hasn't convinced me yet, though he seems to be rated by AVB.  I'd rather have Benny as it stands, Chadli had to cover for Rose far too often today.  Without knowing much about Chiriches, I'd go with Kaboul, and I'd honestly take the Captain first as well.  I'd like to see a strong defensive presence alongside Vert or Chiriches, as both can attack capably, but they might not mix.

Lloris, Soldado, and Walker are easy picks.  I hated leaving Mousa out, but even though it's a small sample size, I like what I see from Paulinho.",0,1377459826,null,0,false,0,cbv53ww,t3_1l2iav,t1_cbv53ww,t3_1l2iav,null,1429703235,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

If you don't get your cash back via payroll you can still get it back as a cheque from HMRC.

There's an argument that Lukaku performs better coming on as a sub and making a difference at a late stage so I'm not too worried. That said, I'm almost certain that we'll see both Torres/Lukaku playing at some point tomorrow.

The question that is most intriguing me at the moment is who is going to play in front of the back line. Lampard has played quite a bit recently so I'd probably expect to see him rested (although it is possible he'll play again). Starting Van Ginkel in such a big match, in spite of how promising he has looked, is unlikely. Personally I think it's vital that Ramires is one of the players in that position.

Marlowe was a fascinating guy: the ascerbic atheism in such a hostile environment, the sexuality, the beautiful poetry in *England's Helicon* and *Hero and Leander*, and of course the innovative plays.

However, the best historical-fiction I've ever read is *Memoirs of Hadrian* by Marguerite Yourcenar. I'd check that out before the Marlowe one.

You will be required to prove the above.

It will cost you lots of money and several appointments to have biometrics taken and to be interviewed at the nearest consulate.

The main reason the green belt has remained popular is that 70% of England are homeowners and if house prices fall then the Government will be unpopular, so inflating them via the artificial scarcity introduced by the green belt works well.

&gt; A good idea is to take a phrase from a book,

A better idea is to take a series of random words, ideally from a good-sized dictionary.  There are far fewer meaningful phrases than there are random combinations of words, and phrases from a book are likely to mostly consist of only more commonly used words.

In my experience such passphrases are often still quite memorable:

* blame syrup laborer before troll
* hurried immortal pimple vanguard hands-off
* covert disorderly king-size shawl freeze
* began stony obstruct cruel warmonger

Courtesy of /dev/random and an ~18,000 word dictionary.  At 10 billion guesses per second ([which these days isn't necessarily a lot](http://www.golubev.com/hashgpu.htm)), it'd take an average of ~3,000 years to crack these.

For comparison, a completely random 8 character password consisting of all 95 printable ASCII characters (mixed case alphanumeric + symbols) would take about a week.

&gt; turn it into an acronym, 

Or not.  The last thing you want is to end up with a short password, especially if by using a phrase from a book you've skewed your password heavily towards the first letters of common words.  12 characters probably isn't a bad minimum to aim for.

Now perhaps the majority of the populace really do want to be surveilled constantly in the name of security, but if we don't know about it, we can't even begin to discuss consent.

Although Greenwald and Snowden may not be qualified (and what does that really mean - members of an elected government?) they are both fully aware of what is actually going on behind the scenes in our names, and they are rightly outraged and blowing the lid on it to reveal the unseen machinations of our intelligence communities to open it up for public debate.

I'd like to think that both of them have enough common sense not to publish anything truly harmful, and so far they have been quite justified IMO.   It's not like governments haven't  endangered people by leaking for their own reasons (Valerie Plame springs to mind), so I don't see the government as having any kind of moral high ground here.

(Also pretty sure you're correct that the government don't entirely know what was leaked - there was a story I read earlier that Snowden bypassed audit logs to prevent discovery, which seems like a pretty basic step if you are a whistleblower with administrative access.

true,chrish1023,flair8,,"Observations from today:

Lloris - He is looking fantastic this season.  He didn't have to do much today, but he was solid when he was called upon.

Rose - Played ok.  He made some poor decisions, but I was never pulling my hair out.  While I want another LB, he has not looked as hopeless as I thought he would.

Dawson/Vertonghen - Solid game.  Hardly noticed them.

Walker - I thought he played pretty well.  You're always going to get your boneheaded plays from him, but he created both of our best chances today while also playing solid defense so I think he deserves some credit.

Capoue - Him and Paulinho fuck shit up in the midfield.  Every time we were dispossessed, those two were swarming and winning the ball back.  Capoue also had a few decent runs, which surprised me given his playing style.

Paulinho - See above.  He was unlucky not to score today.  I kinda wish he would pick his shots better because those were easy catches.  I doubt shots like those will ever stretch the defense given how unthreatening they were.

Dembele - Played ok.  Didn't notice him much which probably isn't a good thing given he's supposed to be our creative midfielder.  If we get an attacking mid, he might lose his starting position given how solid our holding mids have been.

Chadli - Played ok.  He wasn't as effective today as he was last weekend, but still had a few decent moments.  Overall, though, I think he was a solid purchase.

Townsend - I don't think their should be any debate over whether he starts over Lennon.  He is so much more versatile.  I love Lennon, but all he ever does is get to the end line and cross the ball and most of the time, they find no one.  When Townsend receives the ball with a little bit of space, there is no question that he is going by at least one defender.  Sometimes he loses the ball when he gets going, but he was a complete menace today and I think he deserves MOTM.

Soldado - I'm excited about him, but he has not done much at all in either of these two games.  I know players around him are to blame a bit, but I hope he starts getting involved more once the team has a few more games under their belts.

Subs - Didn't notice anything spectacular from them.

Overall decent win.  We need some more quality with our attackers, though, if we're going to play Paulinho and Capoue.  Here's to some good signing early this week and a win against Arsenal next weekend!

true,Sabazius,,Pint of Moonshine,"**Warning: Wall of Text**. I tend to read a lot (a week without consuming at least one book is a poor week for me) and I also like talking about literature, so feel free to skip this if large blocks of text intimidate you. But if that's the case, maybe this isn't the thread for you anyway...

I've recently made my way through *The Long Earth* and *The Long War*, the first two in an upcoming series of soft scifi novels about parallel worlds by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter. I'm a big Pratchett fan and I've never read any Baxter before, so my expectations were based mainly on Pratchett. There was less outright comedy than I was expecting but the books definitely have a sense of humour, and while I've found a few of Pratchett's most recent Discworld novels have been somewhat saccharine I was relieved to find that wasn't the case at all with this series. As is often the case, the second was less satisfying because it felt less like a novel in and of itself and more a part of an ongoing series, but I guess the fact that I'm eagerly awaiting the third shows it's still an excellent work.

Before that, I read *The Windup Girl*, a Hugo and Nebula Award winning post-eco-apocalypse novel by Paulo Bacigalupi, set in Thailand. It's got politics, sex, violence and genetic manipulation, but what really got me is the way Bacigalupi offers such a believable vision of the future of the human race. Definitely worth a read if you like that sort of thing.

Before **that** I read *For the Win* by Cory Doctorow, which is about gold farmers in MMORPGs. Quite apart from a great collection of characters and excellent pacing, it offers a fascinating insight into economics and poverty. One of Doctorow's great qualities as a writer is that he writes stories which are compelling enough to make you want to read on but which require some basic grounding in information theory or economics or copyright law - and then he gives it to you in a way that makes it easy to understand and makes you think. It may come across as a little soap-box-y from time to time but unlike a lot of obviously motivated writers he doesn't resort to an author avatar bogging down the storyline ^^*cough* ^^Ayn ^^Rand ^^*cough*.

Right now I'm working my way through *House of Leaves*, which is just magnificent. I'd try to describe it for anyone unfamiliar but it's incredibly complex and I doubt I could do it justice. Let's just say if you enjoy self-referential, postmodern/post-structuralist, generally 'clever'  literary fiction - anything by Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino's *if on a winter's night a traveller*, Stephen Hall's *The Raw Shark Texts* and Dave Eggers' *A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius* are some personal favourites  of the style- you'll like this, and vice versa.

Robertson interviewed me for PPE so I went along despite having a Quantitative Economics Final the next morning (which I got a Third in fuck yeah). /u/ppeist was largely correct in his summary though, and Robertson criticised the current course structure as arbitrary and incoherent. He traced the foundation of PPE as being a solution to a problem within the University for a declining demand for philosophy tutors thanks to the diminished intake for Greats in the early 20th Century, as well as something for the newly founded 'Political Economy' professors to do aside from handing out mere diplomas at Ruskin. Almost immediately the economists started complaining that the course wasn't mathematical enough, and along with the job security fears of the philosophy professors these two dynamics of have remained constant in the course's programme for almost a century. It also took a surprisingly long time for actual political scientists to get in on the teaching and the 'Politics' part of the triad was taught by historians for most of its history.

The result after 100 years is a course that isn't a jack in any trade, let alone a master. The econ undergraduate course is sub-standard and basic because they're not allowed to be as mathsy as other Depts in the UK thanks to the lack of a maths A Level requirement for PPE. The PolScis are overworked due to being by far the most popular Dept. to do option papers in, and additionally suffer from a serious departmental bias towards new institutionalism which is reinforced by Oxford's inherent conservatism. The Philosophers live in fear of having their positions cut, but also aren't able to teach vanilla Philosophy as they are at Cambridge and inevitably don't get the very keenest undergraduate students who can devote 100% of their time to philosophy. All of this is buttressed by the administrative structure encouraging siloing and conflict between the three Departments. Robbo mentioned that there was a proposed environmental studies option paper a few years ago that sunk because only about two people from all three departments were interested in teaching in an interdisciplinary manner - everyone else has their blinkers on and is a stranger to doing stuff across the Oxon. Depts. The potential for PPE to be a proper 'Degree in the Social Sciences' is totally wasted because you don't get to apply skills from one Dept. to another and you don't make the mental connections that would be a necessary outcome of such a course. 

Robertson said that PPE had two options, along with generally taking a big stick to the whole thing and forcing more inter-departmental work. One was to make PPE into a Four Year course and give you loads of time to explore papers and options. He mentioned that for him, it only really clicked how to 'do' social science at the start of Hilary Term of his Final year and that it was such a waste because he'd spent almost two years studying for his finals w/o knowing how to think like a social scientist and approach questions - this was almost exactly my own experience, which testifies to how little the course has changed. The other option he mentioned was that Maths become a compulsory requirement due to pressure from the economists. It de facto already is (90% of each year have Maths AS), but Robertson was scathing of this path as destructive for the degree because there are plenty of people who would make great philosophers and PolScis who just don't have a mind for maths (such as myself #humblebrag), as is entirely their right. He noted that it takes about twenty years for anything to change at Oxford though, so it will be a long time for any of this to trickle down into actual change for the students. In the meantime, PPEists will be left with a sub-standard and bewildering course experience, and its (historically undeserved) reputation for academic and social prestige should and might wither under such conditions.

Particularly given that that we should remember that that was a *dreadful* opposition, every bit as lacking in a clear message as Milliband is now.

Were you reading the Moncrieff translation? Because I began with that, but switched to the Davis translation half way through Swann's Way. It'd recommend it as it is a bit clearer and less archaic than Moncrieff (Who spent most of his time translating the likes of Stendhal, so used more archaic English in the translation than Proust used in the French original), so it's a bit easier to follow.

The prose is so beautiful that it's worth reading the books for that alone, but the page long sentences and almost Homeric similes can tire you out on occasion. However what makes Proust God-tier for me is just the excellent psychological insight he has. He hits pretty close to home on occasion, and is very good at Madeleine-Caking you and stimulating your own involutary memory.

The seemingly endless tittle-tattle of the aristocrats can seem a bit tedious in this day and age ( he was mocked for it back in the day as well), but through it a load of little clues about characters gradually builds up, until they are excellently realistic. At the end of certain sections ( I won't tell you which because it'll spoil it) he'll create some event or revelation about the characters that will leave you reeling.

That's almost inevitable when you're playing arguably the weakest sides in the league after such a resounding win the week before, and that combined with a particularly weak back two screwed us.

Honestly we looked a lot like we did for long stretches of last year—totally complacent and not at all willing to fight for the win. The best sides in the world don't disregard inferior teams on the basis that they're inferior, they relish the opportunity to curb stomp them. That's why Barcelona wins games 7-0. They show up every week and play the best game they can, not with the minimum amount of quality necessary to win.

I'm sure a lot of this complacency was just because we were playing a ""weaker"" side on the back of a big win, and simply assumed we'd win. I expect that being humbled like this will ensure that it doesn't happen again next week. I also think not having our captain in the locker room exacerbated the issue greatly.

But we don't have Europa which is like £3M in additional revenue, so -£3M from the £10 and we're at maybe +£7M versus the year prior.   Another potential impact is the new TV rights which is worth a fair chunk (~£25M) but that hasn't been paid as of yet and may well not make into the 13-14 FY accounts, which leaves us still pretty near £20M projected loss for FY 13-14.

It most certainly does; I've signed it once when joining a company, and again once I left it, but it was made very clear to me that the act of signing it was meaningless; everyone in the country is bound by it regardless. If you knowingly pass on classified material, regardless of how it came into your possession, you are guilty of breaking the act.

Journalists can get around the act if they publish a story clearly in the public interest, like breaking a scandal, but don't get away with publishing classified material that's merely of interest to the public.

So the system we have right now is essentially self-regulating; the MoD publishes a D-Notice as a warning to journalists (not as a form of censorship; it carries no powers). Editors made decisions on what is responsible to publish. It's a system which has worked fairly well, and needs little in the way of regulation as long as everyone is sensible.

The Snowden leaks have likely changed all that. David Mirranda was likely caught trying to sneak classified material of out the country (that copies already exist outside of the country isn't entirely relevant to the enforcement of the law).

The security services, growing tired of the fuss, warned the Guardian that if they didn't destroy the information they had then legal proceedings would commence (and so the Guardian editors voluntarily destroyed it all; they had what they wanted already).

The result is that hacks get to write lots of stories about evil governments and censorship, but the fragile balance and self-regulation may now have been damaged beyond repair. 

I expect new laws will come in sooner or later. That they had to use anti-terrorism laws to stop Mirranda almost guarantees it.",0,1377473192,null,0,false,0,cbv9df2,t3_1l1yc1,t1_cbv9df2,t1_cbuzbie,null,1429701221,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt; In relation to Wayne Rooney, can you understand that Manchester United will be reluctant to sell him to Chelsea, given your rivalry? 

-Reporter

&gt; He's their player, they know. [indescernable] David Luiz was not for sale, **for example**. So when you own the player, when you have a contract with player for a long time, even **if** the player wishes to leave - and **sometimes** that happens , that contradiction happens - the player wants to leave, the club wants to keep, and it's something we have to make a decision one way or [the] other way. We have to persuade the player to stay, or the player persuades us to sell.

-Jose Mourinho


To me, it looks like the player Jose refers to that wants to leave is Rooney, not Luiz. Including Luiz just demonstrates that a club can refuse an offer from another club for one of their players. The next part subtly calls for Rooney to persuade United to sell. I don't think he meant that Luiz had done that, because there's no reason for him to have brought that to the media's attention. Luiz trying to get Chelsea to sell has not been reliably reported, and the question he's answering is about a different player.

Look under the title ['Commissioner'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Blair#Commissioner), and there is a list of all the major events of his life as Commissioner. When you are reading it, you will think that it is a list of his *mistakes and controversies* as Commissioner, but it's not, it's just that almost every single thing he did while in the job was somehow bent.

I'll give you a summary-

* Tried to cover up the shooting of an innocent man.  

* His own officers sabotaged a case of his to undermine him, showing a complete lack of control and command.
* Attempted to award himself £25k bonus on top of his £228k salary during the criminal proceedings concerning the cover up of the death of the innocent man in point 1  
* Said "" Islamic terrorism ""is a far graver threat in terms of civilians than either the Cold War or the Second World War"". Civilians killed in World War II totalled around 47 million.  
* Gave a £3mil IT contract to his best friend. Another firm later said they had been refused the contract even though they had offered to do the work for £1mil.  
* Paid £15k public money to his close friend and ski partner  
* Got in trouble for being racist, saying that the interest in the disappearance of two young girls must have been to do with their skin colour, explaining *""almost nobody"" understood why it became such a big story.*  
* Secretly taped telephone conversations with the Attorney General
* Wanted to create a united police force for all of London
* Criticised when 78 police officers were used to take placards away from a single anti war protester. Then lied about the cost of the operation.
* Claimed Haringey is so safe you could leave your door open. Remarks called ""truly extraordinary""
* Gives detailed accounts of how he was under fire and in exciting car chases with the IRA in the 70's, despite experts and historians saying that his accounts of the events are literally impossible

And that's it. Every notable event of his career as Commissioner.

Again, remember, this isn't the list of *controversies*, this is not a list of *fuck ups*, that's the total list of *everything* noteworthy that happened. Apart from perhaps the one about creating a united police force, every other point involves some sort of massive failure or corruption.

It's fucking *unbelievable* that this guy has any power still. If there was ever a case for the argument that this country works on 'who you know' and nothing else, its LORD Blair.

Moses' best position appears to be on the right so he'd logically take the place of Stewart Downing. As part of Rodgers' front 4 there'd still be room and money available for more depth. It doesn't have to be a first team player coming in, just more depth, more quality.

Suarez, Sturridge, Borini and Aspas quite clearly haven't been competing for one striker role. Sturridge and Suarez started together frequently last season, Aspas has started alongside Sturridge so far this season etc. They can all play as 9s but also across the front 4. If we go in for a 9 to replace Suarez longterm, it'll likely be another who can do that too. Yesil won't get anywhere near the first team this season, Rodgers hasn't shown much willingness to rotate his squad in the last 9 months and Yesil is just coming back from a major injury and hasn't played a full season for the under 21s yet.
