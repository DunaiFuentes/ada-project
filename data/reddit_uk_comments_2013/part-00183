I'm not saying those specific people *need* it like an addiction, but if that's the only way they know of spending an evening, then that's a problem as it also stops them exploring other things to do and enjoy.

But I agree I'm generalising and really I should be more specifically talking about those who do use it more than someone uses alcohol.

It's good you have that sentiment at the end.  I think the problem is that while for people like you it would be good, certain drugs have the potential to be incredibly damaging not just for individuals but for the economy as a whole - and some drugs potentially harmful for other people around them.  I guess the strategy taken historically, as it is now, is to thusly try and stop all forms of drugs so that those more harmful ones are further away, in effect, by not normalising it and not creating blurred lines.

I've never had anything taken (yet?) following some simple procedures:

Anything you can't stand to lose or live without stays on you at all times. For me this is phone, wallet, keys a multi-tool and fire-starting tools. This is applicable whether your bike is nicked, or crashed and burning.

When you are loaded up don't park in city centres; go to motorway services or head out of the city into surrounding towns and villages, if you need to stop for a bio. This cuts down on the number of people passing your unattended bike, raises the mean wealth of anyone that does and lets you have a chat to locals who will typically be much more receptive than those in a large city.

Try to grab window seats (or takeaway if you want to) that give you LOS to your bike.

Trust your gut. When you stop, look around; if it feels dodgy there is a reason for that. Move on down the road unless you are desperate.

This works for most places in the world.

Very interesting about the LSD, however we must be careful not to rely solely on one study from 50 years ago.  I am of the opinion that we shouldn't be so scared to look into the potential medical benefits, though.

I do understand that not all drug-takers are wasters, but I do feel that far more people use them as ""a chance to get wasted"", as you say, than the way you do.  And you're right that, along with alcohol, abuse can cause problems.  The problem thusly lies in the fact that if enough people do use them to abuse, even if that's just in the short-term with the equivalent of binge-drinking (luckily I'm able to control my actions when drunk within acceptable limits, I know not all do), it causes problems, and if those problems are significant enough if doesn't matter if people do use them responsibly because something has to be done about that problem for their own as well as the community's benefit.

I guess that's potentially where a lot of the friction comes from in the argument.  Those against are mostly thinking about abusers.

However its very hard to find out real information and facts about such a drug when anecdotal evidence, that could have any number of different sources other than marijuana, is spewed left, right and centre and when a scientist says something along the lines of ""its not as bad as alcohol"" he gets fired, see Professor David Nutt.

Here's a Martin Lipton update on Juan Mata:

Chelsea say that Liverpool have expressed an interest in Juan Mata, but no bid received so far.

There could be some movement to come, though. Not sure, however, CFC would let him go on loan (as they did with Moses).

I suspect Liverpool will struggle to find £30m-plus to buy him. And even less likely he would want to go to a club that is not even in the Europa League.

More likely that will stay until January and seek a move then. He is worried about losing his place in Spain squad for WC and if not playing Champions League that would seriously count against him.

Maths and English at GCSE level are not about your ability to read, write and add up numbers, they're about your ability to *do work*[1], to consume and regurgitate information, same goes for all GCSEs really. I failed my English GCSE because I didn't do any coursework and didn't have literary flair but I was perfectly capable of reading and writing... you can read this, can't you?

Apparently the way GCSEs work has changed very recently (I did them in 2008) so it may be the case that it's entirely exam based now in which case you may be right, but the only reason I have any GCSEs at all is because some of mine were based entirely on multiple choice exams... any GCSE that required any work (course work, writing in the exam) I just didn't bother with.

You may well find that if people are subject to even more school with no option to just up and leave at the earliest convenience they may pull their finger out and do the work needed to pass, I probably would have done. I failed because it was an easy way out of school that required minimal effort, if I had no opportunity to leave until I had passed I would have passed.

(I don't agree that holding everyone back until they pass is the right strategy but there certainly are situations (mine for example) where such a policy would have worked. Although I'd argue if students are so disinterested in school that they're choosing to just not bother there are bigger problems than people not passing.)

For some people the two things are the same but in my mind there is a very clear difference.

Some people seek to claim that new high strength cannabis is somehow a different drug to the 70s which somehow justifies our current legal position. As soon as you realize that is a myth, the whole argument falls apart and you will need to readjust your argument to continue this debate.

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"The point is that these techniques are not new and have been used almost since the dawn of horticulture.
You are making a completely different argument. Your argument goes something like ""the average strength of cannabis being tested is rising"" which is a a very different argument to ""new cannabis strains are 5 times stronger than before"" Because the latter argument is used to argue that this new cannabis is somehow different. It's not.

Lets look at a grower of the 70s:

He obtains 20 seeds of unknown origin. He plants all 20 and then takes a clone of each one. At the end of the harvest he compares notes against all 20 plants. If he's lucky one of those plants will be an absolute belter easily equaling the cannabis grown today in strength. So he throws 19 clones away and he sticks with this one mother.

And of a grower today? The only difference is that he will be able to buy seeds of a known origin, and maybe instead of 1 plant out of 20, maybe he will get 5 plants out of 20 that are just as good.

What is the difference? There isn't any, because a grower only needs to find 1 clone.

There is a clone from the 1990's called ""Cheese"", exodus/psychosis. This is still being used today, you can find it in most coffeehouses in Amsterdam and this stuff has been sold on the street for over 20 years.

How can you craft an argument that sets out to say that new cannabis is somehow different and stronger when it's quite clearly a load of bollocks?

&gt;You don't get arrested for possession if you don't possess anything

So your argument is ""don't carry drugs... because drugs are bad m'kay""?

Or perhaps ""always consume your drugs instantly""?

&gt;How many shipping containers do you need to carry £1,000,000 of uncut cocaine? what about £1,000,000 of knockoff vodka?

So your argument is that if alcohol was more expensive there would be an illegal market?

What do you think makes these drugs so expensive in the first place? It's their illegality. You can grow half of them in your own back garden if it was legal. The only reason they are so ridiculously expensive is because of prohibition.

&gt; If &lt;10% of cars explode instantly killing their occupants in their operational lifetimes, that's not ok because 90% of them don't. 

This is incredibly facetious. The point is that these drugs are going to be used weather you try to prevent its use or not. Drug use overall has increased dramatically since prohibition started. It has failed completely despite billions being poured into it and despite millions of people globally being criminalised and having their lives ruined.

That was my point. The war is already lost. And what are you fighting for? To attack 90%+ of people when only &lt;10% are the problem you're going after? What sort of criminal justice system is that?

&gt;If something has negative effects (like drug use) and can be prevented (like drug use) it makes sense to prevent it.

Are you kidding me?! Smoking has negative effects... are you saying that should be banned? So does alcohol, how do you reconcile that?

Legal medications kill WAY more people than illegal drugs do, would you ban all of those?

Ultimately you say that you can prevent the use but if thats true why the hell does pretty much every single PRISON on the planet have a huge drug problem? If you can't stop drugs in a prison how do you expect to do it in regular society? It's a farce, it's impossible.

The best way to reduce harm is legalisation. Not to mention pocket multi-million perhaps billions in tax revenue and free up millions for the police to go after actual harmful crimes instead of harmless ones.

The electricity that you use in your home comes from the National Grid.  Domestic installations can produce a maximum of 4kWh, which is about 18 PV panels.

Solar thermal is mainly used to heat a domestic hot water cylinder. Normally 1 or 2 panels is enough of an collection area.

the wiki page has some good info - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_the_United_Kingdom

&gt; the Low Carbon Building Programme, estimates that an installation for an average-sized house would cost between £5,000–£8,000, with most domestic systems usually between 1.5 and 3 kWp, and yield annual savings between £150 and £200.

so lets say it costs you 8k to install and you only get £150 a year saving, in 53 years you'll have the cost back. However this doesnt include the profit from selling any spare;

&gt; As of March 2012 suppliers are advertising an 8% to 10% return on your investment, and a break even point of 8 to 12 years. 
^ this is including the savings from selling spare energy.

so if you are planning on staying in your house 15-20 years, then it might be worth it.

http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-2339499/Solar-panel-Feed-Tariff-cut-costs-fall--worth-investing.html has some useful info and its claiming 20 years before the install cost is returned - this might be because the tarif was cut again in 2013. 

edit : also the inverters only last 20-25 years, and are currently about 1k each to replace.

another thing to consider is that you are less affected by energy price rises - energy prices have risen on average **15% per year** over the last 20 years in the UK.

Since the weather isn't so predictable as to have hot water always available, they're not as common as perhaps in the warmer spots in the world.  
We have solar panels on one of these ""we'll install solar panels for free if we can take the tarriffs for 25 years"" deal. Got them just before the tarriff rate dropped as the company were trying to get as many in at that time as possible. I believe the contract means we have first dibs on the 'leccy, then it gets sold to the grid any excess.

I think the panels look nice, and sometimes I check the box to see how many KwH we've got (~5,000 atm- ~$1000 says Wikipedia, ~£640 or 208 worth of average use over the last ~year).   
End of the day, it's an investment, cheaper bills in the long run but it's a big initial cost. Probably worth more in the south and the east than the north and the west. You won't get the high tarriff that used to be the case for solar energy sold back to the grid, but you will be able to cut out some of the energy you need to buy.

true,TomShoe,1972crest,,"&gt;I don't think it was fair to sub him off at half time... the whole team wasn't playing well, strikers have to rely on the midfielders

That's true to an extent but more so for Dzeko than for say Aguero. Dzeko is first and foremost a poacher. He's the tip of the proverbial spear and a mighty fine tip he is when the shaft is working properly. But he really doesn't contribute a whole lot to build up play, whereas Aguero, and surprisingly as it turns out, Negredo are much more involved in the movement leading up to goals. Dzeko gets involved in counter attacks and break aways nicely, but he's not particularly suited for slower buildup play unless he's on the receiving end of it, and that leaves one less player to get involved in that kind of play, which can make it difficult. The first half of saturday's game was pretty slow paced, there weren't many opportunities for counters, it was mostly cautious passing just outside the final third, and it rarely ended up getting inside the final third, let alone the box, where Dzeko could do anything with it. The team was lacking that spark necessary to take it from the buildup to the payoff, and the only decent chance we had that first half came from Aguero putting all of that on his own shoulders. Pellegrini probably figured that he needed a striker who'd get more involved if he wanted to score, because Dzeko really doesn't get involved in that kind of play. Funnily though, both of Negredo's chances, including the first goal, came on the break where Dzeko's at his best, and had Dzeko been on, I'm sure he would have scored there too. Naturally this upset him, but hey, that's football.  ",0,1378131558,null,0,false,0,cc07irj,t3_1lkqvh,t1_cc07irj,t3_1lkqvh,null,1429616578,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3

I just basically realised that there wasn't much point pirating any more.

I wanted to play COD Black Ops 2. So I looked on newsgroups, chose a download and let it run. After repairing the file it seemed to install ok but the game was crashing. Turns out it needed an update to v1.1 or something because of a bug. So I then had to find the standalone upgrade which was easy, but also a new crack for that version which is harder to find. So then you are googling all sorts of dodgy crack and keygen sites, risking malware. And the fix isn't even permanent because the next time the game needs updating or bug fixing, you have to go through all that shit again. Same with Far cry 3. It had some bug which caused the game to crash but after updating I could no longer load saves from the previous version.

In the end I found it on super sale on Steam for about £15. I'd spent at least 1hr trying to get my version working and since I earn considerably more than £15/hr it literally isn't worth my time to put in effort to pirate the game and save money - not to mention getting malware on my machine. Get it legal, able to download and install any time I want, upgrades in the background with no hassle, even my game saves backed up. I think games are the best example of piracy not working well. A 150mb rar file of the latest rhianna album or whatever isn't much of a problem but even then I can get it on Spotify if I wanted.

&gt; to keep your strength up you could pick up a weight set and do some stuff at home - amazon has some at £28 , though that'll only really do arms and shoulders - though rowing/cycling will sort lower body out pretty well so you shouldnt do too bad.

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"It is. On days like that, you feel like quitting. Which I did. Hence I no longer work at a GP surgery. 

Okay, many more reasons than that, but disillusionment was a big one. 

Either way, people do not realise just how frustrating the job is. People demanding antibiotics for a sore throat. People demanding MRI scans for warts. People demanding to be let off work because their little finger hurts and they cannot type on a keyboard because of it. 

And I'm not talking about 'demanding'. I'm talking about *demanding*. *Insisting*. Threatening. Shouting. 

People demanding you give them an hour of your time but you only have 10 minutes, because that is what the government prescribes and if you don't meet your quota, you risk the fate of the entire GP surgery. But sometimes you *want* to give them that hour because they genuinely need it and so you stay behind. 

Suddenly, even though you're supposed to be working 9-5, you find yourself working 7.30-8 as it is impossible to cope. Because you don't want to overlook things. Because you feel that being a GP is 70% psychiatry and 30% general medicine. 

You are allowed 10 minutes per patient and that is it - consultation + paperwork. And so your daily list reflects that. But real people aren't NHS instruction videos. They're real people. With many worries. Often you find a patient come in with a sore throat. So, annoyed, you take a history. But something is off. 

10 minutes in, they reveal they have been excreting blood. Or that their spouse beats them. Or that they're seeing things. But your time is up. What do you do? The rules say you have to send them away and ask them to book another appointment. But can you do that as a human being? They just told you a secret they've been hiding for so long. And you just send them away? 

No... no wonder GP's ask receptionists to do their dirty work for them. No wonder the most efficient GP's are generally the most callous ones. Perhaps not in a 'pleasant' surgery, but in a busy one it seems to be the case. Either way, it's not something people tend to realise when they sign up for the whole 'helping people' business. You end up fighting the people you're trying to help. And the system. And, at times, even if you achieve the occasional victory, you feel like you're still the biggest loser.

Supposedly Class A drugs are the most harmful, and opioids/cocaine/methamphetamine are in my opinion correctly banded in that class due to their extremely high dependency potential.

Magic mushrooms and LSD are also class A, suggesting they're as dangerous as heroin, however they're virtually non-toxic. Most of the popular psychedelics have little risk of addiction or physical harm, yet they are lumped in with entirely different sorts of drugs due to the ignorance of lawmakers.

But cannabis is Class B, the same as amphetamine, and above ketamine.

Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is class C, and yet is a common date-rape drug with similar effects to alcohol but effective at a much lower dose. This drug has the potential to cause serious physical harm or death by either overdose or misuse, yet it is somehow considered less dangerous than weed.

None of it makes sense, most of the classifications are politically rather than scientifically based, and the ACMD which is supposed to guide government classification of drugs is roundly ignored.",0,1378133504,null,0,false,0,cc08192,t3_1lkeut,t1_cc08192,t1_cc04x2m,null,1429616339,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

&gt; See, is my overall weight (I'm a big dude) going to be affected by this? 

well, yes and no. Initially you'll lose a lot of water weight as you start exercising, but then you'll get increased muscle gain, so your actual weight might not change as much, but you'll lose body fat which is what make you fit and healthier. Weight as a measurement is kind of annoying, as it doesnt really translate into a fat/muscle split very well.

&gt;Or is there anything that'll stop breaking down if I'm having a high protein intake?

generally you should only have about 1/3 of your daily intake be protein based, as long as you get a fair balance of other foods and don't go crazy eating nothing but chicken all day long, there's basically no downside. Bear in mind that protein itself has no weight loss benefits, its more for helping muscles recover and grow. What i used to do on gym days was eat a tuna/fish based meal afterwards, that seemed to work fairly well.

It does have the advantage that protein tends to make you feel full and so you eat less generally.",0,1378133741,null,0,1378134142,0,cc083q8,t3_1lkmyu,t1_cc083q8,t1_cc07xp6,null,1429616307,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

QPR will pay him a wage and he's on record as saying that he likes Redknapp,  but most importantly Benny doesn't care who he's playing against.  I'm pretty sure he's not all that bothered about playing at all to be honest.  The guy would turn up to WHL on a match day and not know who the opposition was so I guess playing against Doncaster and Hull instead of United and Chelsea won't make a difference to him.  Might in fact prefer it as he won't have to try so hard.  I think it's a shame as I like him and he's been good for us over the years but I don't think he's an AVB sort of player.

As far as I can tell you're just butthurt that the American Armed Forces aren't as great as you think they are. 

Also in the War of 1812 America tried to annex Canada (or parts of) and failed. We were there to stop you from doing so and succeeded. Then when we showed you the error of your ways by taking US land you got all scared and gave up. Called a truce and pleaded for your land back. Even then to show how dirty a nation you were you decided to fight soldiers that were no longer fighting and were just trying to get off North America.

That comm-motion isn't exactly honest with the truth about damage to the paint. Yes the vinyl protects the paint **that it covers** however when you remove it, one of two things happens:

* If you don't have a complete wrap, the parts that weren't covered will have faded so you will have darker areas the shape of the vinyl and even if you don't you can always tell where the vinyl has been - no doubt you've seen plain white vans driving down the road where you can see what lettering was on it previously...

* The stuff is a bastard to get off. You have to take off all the trim/lights/door handles etc removed when it was fitted and if there's any imperfections at all it'll take the paint off.

&gt; Removal of the wrap takes place at the same wrap centre, taking anything from 15-90 mins

Get yourself a Boots Advantage Card, Superdrug Beautycard, Tesco Clubcard, Nectar Card, etc, and you can a) collect points when you spend money and redeem them against purchases, and b) they'll send you special vouchers on things you buy a lot. Some loyalty schemes also send you money off coupons on your birthday. Be very careful about distinguishing between a loyalty card and a store card, however. If you see a percentage anywhere on the paperwork, that's an APR, it's a store card, and it's not worth it.

Sign up for the moneysavingexpert.com weekly email too; one of the things it includes is advance warnings for seasonal and clearance sales.

&gt;  In the past 8 months I've had 8 interviews, which I feel is a step in the right direction considering I had no interviews in the 2 years prior... 

&gt; ...having applied to probably 300 jobs since the start of this year alone...

Something is not right here. It might be the kind of work, it might be your CV, it might be the kind of application you're making... but *something* is not right. 

You need to find out what that is. Take that statistic to your next job seekers meeting. Find out if you can see someone who specialises on making job applications / writing CV's. There's even a sub-reddit for that here I believe! 

The fact is that with that many applications you're either applying to the wrong kind of job, or your CV has some major issue, or your application has some issue, or a combination of them all. I work in recruitment and we work on a similar principle sometimes - the more jobs we work on, the more interviews we get, the more offers for jobs our candidates receive, the more placements we do. 

It's a numbers game. 

Also - and I do sympathise - you can't publicly rely on depression / anxiety as the *reason* you've not found work yet. If you sent your CV into me right now and I hadn't read this thread - I just wouldn't know unless you mention it. Bringing it up as an issue makes me think it will be an issue in any job you take - you need to dispel that myth. You *can* beat that thing - but if you can't convince any employer and are so willing to bring it up right now, what should they think? (I appreciate this is a rant post, not a job application, but you take my point I hope). 

Seek some more advice. Jump through the JSA hoops but work out where you're going wrong and fix that *first* and *then* expect results. Three years out of work is a decent amount of time without a truly compelling reason so you need to work hard to fix the issues you face. *Then* you can expect success.",0,1378137502,null,0,false,0,cc09a12,t3_1lkrwa,t1_cc09a12,t3_1lkrwa,null,1429615759,7,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,7

I'll explain the DDOS usage because you are hard of thinking, that doesn't mean I'm calling you stupid but I'm not ruling it out yet, rather I refer to your overly rigid mindset:

DDOS the word exists in a technical sense (yes it's a word now having transitioned beyond an acronym similar to milf or what have you), referring to the not always automated flooding of genuine or bogus HTTP requests making some service unavailable or some user end client inoperable. However, like any idea this can be generalised as multiple nodes (in the mathematic sense of the word not the networking kind, I won't explain that because I don't want to patronise and you are clearly a person that knows it all) acting in concert to compromise the availability of another node. We can apply that general theory of DOSSability and map it to other scenarios:

1. Activists (the many nodes) flooding Balcombe drilling platform (the single node) disabling access (lack of availability).
2. Downvoters (the many nodes) in a comment thread (the single node) denying the downvoted access (writing to reddit effectively becomes unavailable).
3. Cancer.

&gt; Every new poster gets timeouts from the Reddit system when they try to submit posts or links to stop spamming. It stops happening after you've been around to collect enough karma.

This is not the case because it can happen at any time. If you are unlucky to suffer a flurry of downvotes you'll get the time out.

This is a violation of human politics, but to say that he's just meddling in human affairs is missing a bigger picture. The humans are themselves already involving themselves as much as possible in the aliens around them. The creation of Torchwood, the confiscation of technology, the rebuilding of an empire all auger back to a very pertinent historical part of British history. Let's not call it coincidence that Torchwood and the future of the Empire Harriet Jones wanted to build began with Queen Victoria. The doctor's meddling, which is a response to human meddling, serves as a reminder of the dangers of that expansionist ethos. 

His treatment of Martha... there's not a lot to say about this actually except that I wouldn't describe it as ""vile"". That's a statement reserved for a puritan or inexperienced person who hasn't come across the confusing and nebulous nature of love. We look back towards the season with Eccleston, and Rose was bouncing back and forth between two boys, while the Doctor was flirting with everyone around, and the second he regenerates, we see Rose talking about her love for him. Where was this in the season? This is not a complaint, actually a commendation. The writing here shows the fickle, obtuse, awkward nature of love. Is his treatment of Martha exemplary? Of course not, is it vile? Hardly at all.

For instance if you don't 'support' gay marriage you must be some sort of homophobic arsehole who is stuck in the 1800's. UKIP pointed out some pretty realistic problems with the gay marriage bill (namely the direct conflict with freedom of religion and religious institutes being forced to marry people in ceremonies they disagree with) but were instantly labelled as homophobic without anybody hearing the rest of their argument, which is that government should not be involved in marriage at all but rather should recognise any civil partnerships.

Same with the whole journalist thing. He sent a letter of support to some pretty controversial journalists in European countries (who were often ranting anti-semetic, racist, homophobic stuff) when they were faced with being closed by their respective governments. All of our media instantly jumped onto the whole ""Farage supports racist broadcasts"" angle when actually what he was doing was supporting freedom of the press and disagreeing with governments being able to shut down things that they don't like. People can't understand why you would 'support' something on principle unless you agree with absolutely everything they did. That's how we get selective applications of everything (especially in more left-wing people), which makes it fine to block access to websites promoting racism but as soon as they want to block a website promoting socialism, everyone cries censorship.

Most people can't get their heads around the 'I disagree with you but I support your right to say it' or 'I believe in XYZ, but I am happy for other people to believe ABC', or even 'we shouldn't be talking about XYZ/ABC at all' which is what libertarianism often involves. The government should have no position on gay marriage (oh, I must be homophobic). They shouldn't make no laws based on gender or race (I must be sexist and racist). They shouldn't be able to tell people what they can and can't do with their own bodies (opens a whole can of worms about abortion, drugs, euthanasia).

Yes, it is. One of the most prominent aspects of cannabis is the way it helps the user disassociate themselves from their ailment, just to list a few of the things it helps with: pain relief (in the form of disassociation), glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, alzheimer's (helps slow things down), cancer, AIDS, crohn's, diabetes and many, many, many more.

There is a ton of bad blood when a church splits, often families can even split over it. The battles are so vicious because the stakes are so low.

In terms of a serious reply, if you're up for a serious discussion...  Spurs were faced with a difficult scenario.  Their best player wanted to go to his dream club.   They don't have the lure of high salaries or CL football, yet.  Levy did a good job getting a very high fee for Bale and, IMO, they reinvested the money pretty well.  The team that played yesterday was very good defensively, save for that one moment when Rose and Dawson fell asleep.  They lacked creativity.  They needed that killer pass to feed to Soldado/Defoe.  Eriksen didn't play.  Holtby isn't match fit yet.  Lamela played for 10 min and hasn't trained yet.  Siggy has been slightly out of form.  Once these players start to click, then the style of play will be drastically different.

As for Ozil, he's an amazing signing for Arsenal, no doubt.  I just think its a lot of money to spend on a player that A) doesn't necessarily want to leave Madrid and B) you don't really need.

That's not the way I'd put it.

I demonise a whole industry because I don't want to pay for what's on offer - because it's very poor quality and not worth paying for. I have a reasonable disposable income and when it comes to music I don't have to watch what I'm spending. If I see a CD I want it's no issue just to buy it... but they don't seem to want my money.

I also strongly disagree with the basic principle behind long copyrights. Art is not produced in a vacuum, every piece of music, literature or film is a product of our collective culture. 

The *only* reason copyright has ever existed is to encourage artists to make sure that more content arrives. There's no basis in my opinion for copyright to last a particularly long time, and after x number of years it should expire. 

The whole tone of the rights industry has been cynical and oppressive for as long as I can remember. Price fixing, nasty copyright measures built into CDs, DRM, nasty lawyer thuggery etc.

Music is finally starting to arrive in a pleasant and easy to consume format - but it's been a very, very long time coming, and it seems to me that the appeal of music has greatly decreased since it's heyday in the mid 90s - so perhaps it's too late already for it. 

Most of the time if I go for a drink in a pub it's music from when I was a teenager that's playing, not current music. The publishers killed the industry by refusing to produce content in a way that people could consume, and trawling out banal slurry from all of these reality shows on TV. However you could equally argue that it's just changed, and that's the entertainment now, and I'm just stuck in the past.",0,1378141554,null,0,false,0,cc0apam,t3_1lkgbi,t1_cc0apam,t1_cc05fp3,null,1429615028,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Going from the numbers above the club has a transfer net spend of about +£20m (if sakho and ilori cost £25m).  Obviously the club has missed out on major, superstar style signings with the likes of willian and mkhitaryan

I feel Borini is important for depth as neither aspas or moses would really be adequate to be the main striker.  Then again, what is best for him is to get play time, but i also feel like he wont get that at sunderland as they already have 3 strikers.  If anything, perhaps a loan move to West Brom would be better as they only have Long and Anelka at this point, unless Di Canio will play 2 strikers.

The job centre should accept any record you give them of your job search as long as it's clear.

Create a table with columns titled ""date"", ""what I did"", ""what I'll do next"", ""when"". 

Just add an entry for every job site you visit and and jobs you are following. You can also use this as a place to save any links and notes. 

I found that you really have to be clear with what you are doing and give the best impression of yourself. They have the power to really mess you up but it's not in their best interests.

&gt;How can you craft an argument that sets out to say that new cannabis is somehow different and stronger when it's quite clearly a load of bollocks?

put bluntly it's not, it's simple biology making my argument for me, and your argument makes several assumptions that are not really true. if you pick the best plants, even the best clones, you will over several generations get a stronger plant in the desired aspect. 

now we're on the subject to say cloning produces the exact same plant is quite clearly a load of bollocks, DNA gets damaged and mutates all the time, even in different parts of the same plant you will not find 100% accurate DNA, now you will say the effect is negligeable but if you consider ""cheese"" the cheese plant of today will have cone through the clone process over 20 times, each time the cutting taken will be from a plant that has produced good product, and from a specific part of the plant, this over several generations is proven to produce plants that are stronger in the desired characteristic. this isn't mumbo jumbo or bad science it's fact.

The grower of today in your example does not get 5 plants just as good through selective breeding, he gets 20 plants that are 5 times better after at least 40 generations of picking the best plant.

the ""cheese"" of today is not the same ""cheese"" of the 90s and it won't be the same ""cheese"" in 10 years time

I think that sums it up. At an individual level there is huge variation, and you should be able to find a niche clique of people at every college. 

So being changed by the college, or rather the people in it, can be avoided. Though there will be a few leftists that choose King's, trust fund babies in John's, people with perfect exam results at Trinity, and old ladies at Lucy, etc. As some people will be attracted to those College stereotypes, or what the college itself targets (i.e. Trinity getting a lot of applicants with high marks, or not having guys at the girl only colleges).

The reason for it is that you can text the studio phone your 'shout outs' so they shout out your friends or whatever. It doesn't automatically send texts or anything like that. I specifically designed it so that it triggers your SMS app (which ever you use) and then send the text from there (so it's fully transparent what's going on). 

Still, point taken, when we update the app next I'll stick a note explaining the various permissions and suchlike in the header text. Just so everyone knows exactly what the app does etc. 

Thanks for the feedback. I'd wondered if that was going to be an issue and then forgot to list the permissions in the listing itself. Obviously my friends etc are happy to install the app regardless so it slipped my mind, but you're right. If you don't fully know the source of the app, one should be careful of randomly accepting the permissions without explanation. 

Edit: Oh, and the 'Contact Studio' option would have been a bigger problem as it automatically called the studio when you pressed it. I had though it would make it easier to use, but yeah, on reflection I think it would have been a surprise to users the first time they pressed it. It was removed after a request from the DJ's to take it off to stop too many calls coming to the studio when they were doing shows etc. But yeah, thanks for the feedback.

One starts out as being the most arrogant, and with the least justification, of them all.  But this is when he's still quite young and finding his own way in the universe.

Four is a lot more complex than you make him out to be.  One of the things that allows Seven to get away with the things he does is that he's rethinking some of the stuff he believed as Four.  Four is loud, and seems arrogant, but this is mostly a way to get people not to take him terribly seriously.  He's hiding under bombast, something Six does too (but not as well).

Depending on which media you consider canon, or choose to accept, Eight is capable of towering arrogance and is on a par with Ten. He's got the same cold anger that runs all the way through the Doctor's regenerations too.

I think THE Doctor is just another way of saying MY Doctor.  It's character defining moments, and Four had more than Two - in large part because not all of Two's are available to view - but also because Four was Doctor Who at it's most popular and most accessible, just as it was with Ten.

Four is complex but still arrogant in the same way as Ten - he is arrogant to others to put them off, but he is also arrogant to his own companions for the sake of demonstrating his own superiority. Romana I was great at calling him out, and Ten would have been better off if he had gotten his own Romana I (Donna almost plays this role). 

Eight is hard to discuss, because we don't know anything about Eight within the continuity of the TV series outside of the movie. He certainly was not painted that way in the movie.

There is a huge difference between THE Doctor and MY Doctor, which is a problem the fan base is having right now. A lot of New Who fans see the Tenth Doctor as THE Doctor, not THEIR Doctor. The fact that most people tend to prefer their first Doctor, the Doctor at the peak of the show's popularity, or the Doctor who they watched live the longest points out that people are completely biased in their views. I watched the entire TV series from 1963 - 2013 and THEN I went back and considered each Doctor in the context of the entire show. My first Doctor was Nine, I loved Four during his epic 7-year run, and I've been able to follow along with Eleven live, but when it comes down to viewing the series as a whole, I realize the Nine is really an atypical Doctor and despite the great writing during Four's run, Baker's acting isn't anything special and the forced eccentricity gets a bit stale. I still love Eleven, but when I think of MY Doctor, it's a more of a group of Doctors (Two, Seven, Eleven) rather than one Doctor.

 Our R.S. lessons at school did far more to put people off religion than anything else before or since. We had one guy who'd seen ""The life of Brian"" at 11 years old, he was amazing at calling bullshit when he saw it. He was indifferent to which particular cult he was slamming, they were all BS in his eyes. 

It was a ""C.O.E"" school, filled mainly with ""people of faith"" (you had to lie to get in, it was a reasonable school, with good results, on my application, I was a regular church goer) 

I feel bad for the teacher (A priest), he never really had a chance, he had to sit there in his dog collar and preach the messages of other faiths as if they were as valid as his personal beliefs, you could just tell he was telling you because he had to, and so you'd 'understand' how hard it was to defend the unprovable from other points of view. 

We had pretty much ""one of everything"" it being an inner city school, and we'd talk amongst ourselves about our ""faith"". Now as an adult I can see the people I've grown up with, they aren't as stern as their parents, they seem to honour their families in the major respects with regards to their faith, but they don't practice it. In this one instance, it appears to have worked, I love among people of other faiths, not near them, I don't fear them, they don't fear me.

The new generation of ""faith schools"" scare me however, there's no parent who's not a muslim who's going to willfully send their child to a Muslim Faith school, it's not going to happen. Just won't. They've shown an agenda and bias in the very name, it's not a name based on 'the past' or 'how it used to be', it's brand new, it's choice of branding is very clear, and it is segregating our children for us.

I've since forgotten most of the specifics of what I learned but the conclusions have stayed with me.

I'd should add a little bit to my point though. The thing that I have always believed about the Doctor is that he's a guardian, and he's doing what is right for the universe.

What makes the Doctor truly a hero is his ability to do what is right when it is needed, he takes the moral high ground because he's supposed to take the moral high ground.

There's nothing stopping you from using your Natwest account in South America, provided you're not in a country on the UN watch list (and if memory serves me, there's no South American countries on the list).

With recovering your OLB account, /u/ieya404 is right. Your sort code will be *underneath* your name on the debit card, and will start 5x-xx-xx. The only thing missing from the debit cards are account numbers.

If you do need to call, then you can use the number on the back of your card. The latest number is *supposed* to be ~~0044 8705888444~~, but 0870 from abroad? Officially fuck that noise. Use 0044 1423 532590 instead. It'll be slightly cheaper than the 08705 number, and will get you directly through to the OLB team. Because of the time difference, I'd suggest giving them a call at about 9am your time, should miss most of the call traffic at that time.

And lastly, If you're transferring directly from the account, you can now do that through the Online Banking portal. All you'll need is the details for the recipient account, and you're sorted. It'll tell you how much the fees are before you do the transfer as well.

true,Tetracyclic,eng-devon,Plymerf,"This depends *heavily* on your area. My partner suffers from severe mental illness and has been hospitalised on several occasions. It still takes months to get access to treatments that are likely to help beyond medication. The best treatment she has received was from an eating disorder charity in our area who are supported by wealthy patrons and who have excellent staff (therapists, dieticians, etc), however the eating disorder is only a single aspect and they were unable to offer her support for any other symptoms. While receiving treatment there, she couldn't receive treatment anywhere else, other than from her GP. After her first hospitalisation it took nine months for her to be able to see a therapist, however the trauma expert they'd been promising left the area, and so she's been seeing a student therapist for several months.

Due to co-morbidity of several serious mental illnesses she's ended up in the centre of two turf wars between NHS treatment groups in the area who were incapable of actually helping someone because they couldn't resolve their politics for several months.

Even when they're upheld, complaints don't really achieve much in the way of helping her.

We have a *serious* problem with mental health treatment in this country, beyond the most rudimentary support for depression and anxiety.

true,PopeTheoskeptik,eng-northumberland,North of The Wall,"You're spot on there. I'm in a good position to say this, as I'm reasonably atheistic in my thinking, and yet my youngest kid goes to an RC school for pretty much the reasons you outlined. It's the only school in the area with a decent offsted report, and there's less violence than in the other options.

However, I've no problem the bairn mixing with immigrants or other poor people (myself included there), and the main reason I didn't cause a fuss when her mother decided she thought the RC was the best option, is that they are doing a bloody good job of educating her.

I made no bones about my lack of faith and general scepticism regarding churchy stuff, and apart from some snideyness from some of the churchier parents, the school didn't seem to care, being more concerned with the chances of geting a kid who's parents seem academically capable, and thus presumably willing to help her do homework etc.

The idea that they'd be in a position to pressure me into going to church is laughable. Seriously. I know that I'd be such a workie-ticket that they'd bar me pretty quickly. I think the giggling would be sufficient.

So, as to why I don't try and improve the other schools? Well, I sort of do, but more the one my eldest goes to rather than the local first schools.

For the record, I went to a CoE school for a year when I was a kid. Worst year of my school life. But the bairns' mother went to RC schools and came out with no churchiness at all, so I figure it's pretty safe. After all, the bairn is a bairn, and as such is allowed to believe in fairy stories for a bit. It's possibly a bit of a problem that she's getting into Monty Python though. She really enjoyed Holy Grail, and talks about it with her friends. So exactly how it'll go down at school when she watches Life of Brian, I can't really say.

Unfortunately, in order for a surgery to be profitable, the GP needs to be seeing as many patients as possible during the day.

Hence, it does make sense for the receptionist to discourage people with the sniffles from taking up a slot (and rightly so).  This is why pharmacists etc do the same.

An officious receptionist is bad for any practice, but they shouldn't be using their position to intimidate or discourage patients from attending.  If you experience this, then politely inform your GP when you see them.

With him and Carzola on the field together, I fully expect them to step on each other's toes a bit.  Also, with Walcott preferring to drift inside a bit now, it narrows their attack tremendously when those three are on the field together.  

When you look at our competition for top 4 this year, a lot of teams have made puzzling signings:

-City signed two forwards when they really only needed one

-Arsenal signing a CAM when that should have been the least of their priorities

-United looking set to sign Fellaini when they desperately needed a creative midfielder

true,michaelisnotginger,,Boring,"Well tbh there's a limited amount you can do with that amount of weight. I'd recommend if your main goal is to lose weight to do some sort of cardio 3-4x45 mins a week. A lot of people push high intensity interval as the way forward but if you're unfit, steady state running/fast walking/cycling/swimming will do you equally as well. 

With the dumbells I would look into doing circuits with them - something like

goblet squat

shoulder press

dumbell row

lateral raises

stiff legged deadlift

floor press

bicep curls

tricep extensions

or something like that for 3-4 circuits, each one doing 12-15 reps. You might have to pause between weights to adjust the weight settings, as some may have to be higher than others. I'd look into getting 



a) a barbell with some weights (not much)

b) an adjustable bench

c) if you have the money/space a power cage then you can do all the main strength building exercises

In terms of diet carb cycling is the way forward - eating a higher protein diet will help you shed water weight as well - though low carbs will make you feel a bit crap initially.

This is an event that polarizes opinions whenever it comes to town and generally results in delays on local roads and public transport due to protestors.

A few years ago, a number of peaceful protestors were arrested here which lead to new ACPO advice on the handling of peaceful protests and an amount of taxpayer money being used to settle claims. I think Mark Thomas got some bits for a new book, partly by 'kidnapping' some people who were planning to visit the fair from their hotel, haranguing them for donations to a charity on the bus, then delivering them to the expo.

The advertising that the public see outside the show is always more restrained than this and you'll hear many differently biased views on the event. Some will tell us that the arms fair is good for local business. Other people will tell us that the industry as a whole is essential to peace and stability. On the other side of the coin, we'll hear from people who believe the entire industry and all associated companies are just [masters of war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_War). It's up to you to make your mind up how you feel about it.

What I do find telling though is that inside the expo, we see adverts for bullets and bombs and tanks. We don't see that outside the expo. That lack of willingness to be honest about what is being sold and promoted inside tells a story all of its own to me.

 Yes, we missed out on some attacking targets, but we kept Suarez and added Aspas (who needs time to settle) and Moses to the attack. 

 Mingolet - He's already shown that he was worth every penny. He's a genuinely top-class 'keeper, and while his distribution isn't as good as Reina's, his decision making and reactions are. 

 Toure - I don't need to say anything about this. He's been immense and didn't cost anything. He's a proven winner and leader with a massive personality, and at 32 he's still in great shape.

 Cissokho - Shame he got injured already, but he's a quality player with a proven record and we needed cover in that position.

 Alberto - Very young, but very promising. He's very composed and his technique is fantastic.
 
 Aspas - A lively player with a turn of pace and great ideas. He's still adjusting but in a few months I think he and Suarez could link up very well. He adds another attacking option, which was needed.

 Moses - Premier league track record, very skillful and direct. He could be a big player this season. Too bad it's only a loan.

 Ilori - I don't think many of us know too much about this kid, but a lot of clubs were interested in him. I'm really looking forward to seeing him play.

 Sakho - I don't think everyone understands exactly how good a signing this could be. He's one of the worlds elite young defenders, and I honestly think that in a few years people will be raving about how much of a brilliant piece of business this was. I think he's going to be a really important player for us.

More importantly, I'm not at all convinced his re-introduction to the team will have a positive impact.  This ban we're 7-0-1 without him- everyone is playing as a team, morale and spirit look very good, very little moaning/complaining on the pitch, etc.  If things start looking poor once he's back in the side (and I hope they don't) then that will be very telling.

With any luck, the nugget will shut his mouth and figure out how to a part of the team instead of thinking himself above it and everything goes swimmingly but personally my preference would have been for him to go and BR have time to get targets he feels would have moved the team forward.

Your local Freecycle/Freegle is an option but be prepared for a lot of deadbeats who show interest but never follow up on it. However you can find out where your teddies are actually going to which is reassuring.

Car boots are great but you need to find one, get up early (if you want a good pitch you need to get there bright and early) and then be prepared to deal with the most skinflint cheapskates in Britain. I once had a person offer me £2 for about 50 children's magazines (they were a collection and still had the free gifts) that were in near-perfect condition. Needless to say they left my pitch empty handed.
Toys move well on some car boots and in others they just sit there. It's entirely dependant on the buyers.

I've heard animal shelters will sometimes take in cuddly toys to use in comforting baby animals. That's quite a nice idea but I don't know how you'd go about it. You could always find a local shelter and phone them to ask.

Best of luck and I hope your teddies find a good home!

Managing minor conditions or chronic conditions is not a good use of the time of someone who is so highly paid and so unspecialised. 

For both minor and chronic cases a much better system would be regular longer appointments with a nurse and occasional check-ups with a specialist. As well as online monitoring of your case by filling out specific measures relating to the case. Our use of technology is ridiculous when it would be able to do so much of the leg work. For example just inputting weight into your online clinical record would save thousands of lives a year.

We are emotionally attached to a 1950's idea of healthcare and it has become seen as right wing to want to change that. Which is not at all helpful. Doctors can be great and they can be useless just like every other walk of life. They are however a vested interest and what they perceive as best for themselves is sometimes a conflict of interest with the best possible healthcare provision.

I fucking hate Arsenal fans. Seriously, they go the whole summer without signing a player and have a squad that is so thin it's practically see through and all they do is bitch and moan and call for Wenger's head. Now, they make ONE good signing and Wenger is god's gift to football again.

They act as if he has orchestrated this all along and all his stingy rejected bids were some kind of Ocean's 11 long con all along. While Ozil would be a welcome addition to any squad, spending their entire ""War-chest"" on a player who plays a position that is already occupied by one of Arsenal's few players that could be considered anywhere near ""Top Class"", doesn't quite seem like some tactical genius to me.

While I love to see Arsene consistently show how out of touch he is becoming with the way the modern transfer market works. The obnoxious amount of naive Gooners is taking a lot of the fun out of it.

true,themightypierre,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; I don't think a lot of South America would be keen to get involved either.

Pretty sure I read that they wouldn't deal with boats carrying the Falklands flag a while back.

&gt;And who would help us on the UNSC? From the permanent members, it would quite obviously be **the one country you refused to mention**, France. Any issue where we as a European Nation are under threat, you can bet that the rest of the EU in general will do what they can to prevent any instability.

Refused ? Am I under interrogation ? Anyway yes I guess france and the rest of the EU would support us. I'm certainly not against our fellow Europeans. I want us to get along with everyone.

I was just using the Falklands as an example. As I recall America did not help but they also did not lean on us to heavily to back off. If they did we would have known about it. So its good to have friends.

Although the British took small parts of New England and used naval superiority along the Atlantic coast to successfully raid coastal cities including the capital, the Americans took Lake Erie and destroyed the tribal confederation the British had hoped to use as a neutral buffer between American and Canadian territories in the northwest. Even after the end if the Napoleonic wars, the British won few decisive battles. The Americans turned back the invasion of New York State, attack on Baltimore, and New Orleans.

There was no reason to continue fighting the war on either side after the British ended trade restrictions and sailor impressment but couldn't successfully take any significant amount if territory. I wouldn't call this a win. I would say that Britain had lost its will to fight and America had no interest in continuing since it got what it wanted.

true,Yellowbenzene,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"I'm not sure which metrics you think would be suitable for self entry.  Even weight needs to be measured on a standardised, accurate scale.  Home scales vary widely in accuracy and would not be suitable for calculating drug doses etc.  Not to mention that any sort of self-reporting by patients would require them to have a degree of medical knowledge, which trust me, most patients do not possess. Such a system would also be totally open to people lying in order to be seen quickly and to get medication.  I have seen people who have lied to NHS 24 staff in this way.

Besides, primary care is miles ahead of what it used to be in the 1950s so it's not really a fair comparison.  One simple example - results are available to your GP on screen, to view cumulatively as a graph, identifying any trends.  Some GPs allow email or text conversations with patients in lieu of face to face contact for certain conditions.

Look at it this way.  It's much, *much* cheaper to keep people out of hospital and away from specialists if at all possible. The reason your GP is a generalist is because that is exactly what they need to be.  They need to pick up on relevant presentations which warrant a hospital referral, and to be able to manage chronic diseases and minor illnesses in the community.  People being able to self-refer to a hospital consultant would be a disaster in this country.

Most GPs will be paid 60-70% of the figure you quote.  Commensurate with more than a decade of vocational training and the weight of responsibility attached to the job.

true,chimpyang,null,null,"They are specialised at being generalists.  And the wealth of experience that comes from seeing many patients from an ""unselected community take"" gives them a lot of nous and sixth sense.  People who are ill do not always get just that one disease, and one of the challenges of managing chronic ill health is how to manage concurrent illnesses that manifest with the chronic condition. Example: Mr AB is a 72 year old man with COPD, fine, COPD is a common chronic condition, and the argument can be made that you could filter out this into a ""production line"" of specialists only managing his COPD.  But after a while, the COPD leads to development of Heart Failure, now, the lung specialists who deal with COPD are less hot at being on the ball with heart failure, so you'd be inclined to see your local heart specialist nurses/doctors.  Who are gee whizz at sorting those problems out for you.  But then again, what medicines they want to give you don't always play nice.  And they're often too busy (due to lack of numbers) to see you often enough to fiddle with the doses so that we try and arrive at the goldilocks level of ""just right"" in terms of disease and symptom management.  So who is at the heart of this? The GP, the person who is more available for you to see, who will over their career, see many patients with similar symptoms (common things are indeed common) and know of how slight differences in management had different effects in each.  They will use their knowledge to guide you throug the myriad of options that specialists often bring, and also help sort out the social and medication side of community care.

Chelsea: Definitely top 4. I don't know their squad that well but it just seems inevitable. Fucking oil money.

City: Should be great, but then again, they lost to Cardiff, so they're definitely vulnerable. However, I think that's probably just a blip on the radar and they'll be dominant as usual. 

United: Good on paper, but the combination of loss to us + bad transfer window ending + long break to fixate on it could lead to internal dissent and distraction, so there's hope there.

Arsenal: Ozil signing is big, but he's just one man; they still lack for depth and it they stay in the CL long enough it could hurt them. (But I doubt they will).

Spurs: On paper, a dominant squad. On the pitch, I think they'll need at least another month or so to gel, after which they should be very dangerous. 

Us: I think our squad is great. Our success or failure this year rides on how well we can keep up this getting-the-results mentality, and a little bit of luck (in terms of injuries and whatnot). I'm not sure we'll get top four this year, but I do think we have the weapons to be a serious part of the conversation, and if we can keep the right mentality and avoid bad injuries, I expect that however the season turns out, we *can* be in the running for top four.

You should however ask for help and if this new advisor is just being difficult, ask for an appointment to get assistance with jobseeking separate to your sign on date.

Essentially, if you've done everything on your jobseeker's agreement, then as far as I know they can't actually sanction you.  What they can do is put you forward for sanctions if they're of the mind that you're not trying (some will just believe what they want), but it has to get past a decision maker.  They'll look at what's actually been done, not just how the advisor feels that day.

Also, as someone with depression and anxiety of my own, I'd recommend looking for a volunteer role that suits you - not just because it may make you feel better, being useful, but it gives you a regular pattern in the week, a reason to sort yourself out in the morning to be going out, and also, networking genuinely does work, I've got recommendations, references and knowledge of vacancies from where I volunteer.

In fact, my volunteer place has been far more useful in my job search than the job centre.

Also, you don't have to sit in a charity shop sorting thru old jumpers, maybe ask at your local council, there may be a supported living place that could use an IT tutor, to get people online, that kind of thing.

However, they're supposed to do it by a number of activities a week (which again, doesn't really work, checking a shop window's ads for vacancies for 2 minutes is equal to the 4 hours I spend at a local job club.)

As tiresome as it is, check 5 sites Monday to Friday, that's your 25 done, then make a few calls, send some speculative cvs, check shop windows, check local papers, ask friends and family if they've heard of anything suitable.

Anything related to job search should go on your 'diary', it's then down to her to refuse its validity, and then if pushed, a decision maker has to decide she's right in ignoring your efforts, and that you've not done enough without that one thing.

I agree that some things you will have to do, even tho they're a waste of time, purely to satisfy the DWP's hunger to see us waste our time to qualify for benefits.  I don't like to admit it, but when I've done everything in a fortnight to find work, and my jobseeker's record still feels a bit lacking in actual job applications, I will tend to get onto the online sites and just apply for almost anything to boost my numbers.  It feels wrong, but then I know I've done all I can and I'm only doing what's required, no matter how pointless it feels and how many people's time I might be wasting.

(Just an aside, I wonder how many man hours are wasted each year since this lot got into power thru job applications written and sent purely to hit targets?)

I may understand at least partly how you feel, but in my experience, I found that surpassing my agreement, and proving each week I was doing more than expected, meant that I actually ended up getting left alone pretty much.

I'm not sure what I should recommend to you, and I don't know how dangerous it might be to complain to the manager or ask for a different advisor.

Not all C of E schools are like this.  The RE lessons at my primary school never even mentioned other faiths, and taught bible stories as if they were historical fact.  As I understand it, ordinary state schools (not religious schools or free schools or academies) have a curriculum they have to follow for RE that involves teaching about a variety of different religions, but faith schools can teach whatever they want.  They can also teach whatever they like in sex education lessons (e.g., condoms don't work, gay people are evil, sex outside marriage is evil - and yes, Catholic schools have certainly been known to teach this stuff).

&gt; The new generation of ""faith schools"" scare me however, there's no parent who's not a muslim who's going to willfully send their child to a Muslim Faith school, it's not going to happen. Just won't. They've shown an agenda and bias in the very name, it's not a name based on 'the past' or 'how it used to be', it's brand new, it's choice of branding is very clear, and it is segregating our children for us.

Still surprised we managed to sign Sakho, people were talking about him being a future France captain and becoming one of the best in the world until the oil money came in and he lost his place in the team. He hasn't played yet but I feel if he settles he will be a key part of our defence for years to come.

Kolo is a great signing, an improvement on Carra as much as I love him.

Mignolet already looks better than Reina last season, and has been big for us against Stoke and Villa.

I rate Moses highly, and while I would have liked a more proven signing on the wing, he will do well. He is direct and has pace, the antithesis to Downing. 

Aspas wasn't great yesterday but he wasn't bought for those games, he'll make a difference against the lower table teams who sit deep. He will do fine as back up to Suarez/Coutinho.

Cissokho and Alberto will be good back ups, and both have potential. Alberto looks far more suited to our football than Shelvey.

None of the players that have left were better than what we have, few will be upset about them going. We managed to get decent fees for Shelvey and Carroll. 

Borini will hopefully get some experience for Sunderland. Suso looks like he is developing extremely quickly from what I have seen so far.

We didn't make a huge signing, like Ozil, but we haven't overlooked our weaknesses which is important. Our defence looks much better, and we have a lot more depth.

true,jkonine,null,null,"Here's my assessment of the situation.

Yesterday, Real Madrid had pretty much undisputedly the best 3 players you would ever want behind the striker and in front of the defensive midfield. Ronaldo is the best player in the world at his position. Di Maria is the best player in the world in his position. Ozil is the best player in the world at his position if you don't include Bale (which I have a feeling you will, which would put Ozil probably in second place).

Now when Barca bought Neymar, Madrid panicked because Neymar had just had a tremendous confederation cup and actually said no to them. It was embarrassing. So that meant that it was time for Real Madrid to make a ""game changing"" transfer. 

So they went after Bale. Which was extremely stupid of them. They never needed Bale. What they needed was a striker. I've been saying for months that Suarez to Madrid made the most sense of any response to the Neymar deal. Benzema is easily the weak link of that Madrid attack (not that he isn't bad, but everyone around him is so damn good.) But Madrid was hell bent on Bale. So Levy had them at his mercy. We know what happened next.

So now Madrid has 4 utterly world class players, with 3 places to put them. Roanldo is untouchable at the ~~Right~~ left Wing. Which leaves Ozil or Di Maria left out, depending on where Carlo Ancelotti decides to put Bale. And have no doubt about it. Bale is playing. You don't spend 100 million on a player to put him on the bench.

My feeling was that Arsenal was aware of this situation, and was looking to chomp on whoever was the left out player. Neither one would stand to be on the bench at their respective stages of their careers. Had Ancelotti wanted Bale on the right, Di Maria would be the Arsenal player today. But because Bale has been playing centrally for Tottenham, it makes sense that he would play centrally for Madrid.

With Ozil left out, Arsenal pounced.

The team looks to have a good air about them- no negativity, morale is high, lots of smiling, these are all very, very good things.  The team have undoubtedly proven to themselves that they can win games without him which is also a good thing.  

When Suarez comes back into the side the media scrutiny will be intense.  Lots of people analyzing everything, from the way he parts his hair, to how he laces his boots.  Will he shake Evra's hand or not?  Will he want to leave again in January?  Etc, etc.  These are major distractions and in the back of my head if I was a player all I would be thinking was 'this guy wanted out of the club, called the manager a liar, and said I wasn't good enough and yet all anyone talks about is him'.

Top that off with he's incredibly wasteful in front of goal, loses possession an awful lot, has a real tendency to bitch at the players on his own team, and likely still wants to leave and I just don't see keeping him around as a good idea at all.  I would much rather have had Turan (a guy who loves the club and would give 110% every game) plus perhaps another attacking player than to have kept Suarez.  I'm sorry but 30 goals after taking the 2nd most shots in all of Europe bar Ronaldo is just not that impressive to me.  

Add it all up and I fear that things could go quite south once he gets brought back in.  I hope I'm wrong and Suarez figures out how to actually be a part of the team but I'm really not optimistic on that front.

EDIT:  I'd also add I just don't like the prick which doesn't help my outlook either.  The Achilles stamps, the stepping on peoples chests, handballs, diving, biting another professional for the 2nd time, being banned not once, not twice, but thrice, the constant moaning at his teammates when he doesn't get the pass he wants, the nutmegs which work 1 out of 50 times, the stupid shots with a very low probability of success instead of just holding up play or passing to a teammate, the little cheap elbows he throws when no one is looking, the eye gouging, and most importantly he doesn't want to play for Liverpool all add up to GTFO then for me.",0,1378163228,null,0,1378163571,0,cc0ibpo,t3_1llthp,t1_cc0ibpo,t1_cc0i2vq,null,1429611400,-7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-7

If those 999,000 each take a 0.01% loss in their hours worked, the remaining 1,000 will have a full time job to work. This negates the need for the population to supply that full amount of people with income, gives each of the population a fulfilling job, but also time, spare income (from the reduction in tax) to educate themselves, or do recreational activities. This in turn, creates more jobs as the service industry booms to meet the new demand for leisure and educational services. This is where the government led minimum wage kicks in, all this new labour is not to be forced to minimum wage as it stands now, but to allow the internal population to drive the economy.

This also leads to a rise on job satisfaction, productivity, a decline in sickness, a decline in unpaid leave etc etc.

If you worked 24 hours a week and spend the remaining 16 of a normal 40 hour week in education, you would have greater job opportunities.

my name in real life is Aiden i am here looking for a decent time that can trial me. My previous team (mXs) has sadly disbanded as the team captain couldn't play for personally reasons while i was in (mXs) i learned quite a lot about dota and buffed up my supports skills and knowledge about my role.
heroes i can play: Visage,Windrunner,Jakiro,Shadow Demon,Bane,Rubick,Crystal Maiden,Leshrac,Lina,Veng,Tide Hunter,Treant,Earth shaker,Nyx,Lion,Kotl,Sand King,Naga
Heroes i am currently learning: i can play these heroes but i need more time to be 100% comfortable with them. IO,Enchantress,
My micro skills are vastly improving over time
Times i can play: i will be available from 5-12 on the days Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Friday,Sunday
these times might change but i will give a 24 hour notice previous to the day i wont be able to play.
What i am looking for.
I am looking for a dedicated team that understands their goal and what they want to achieve, a team that wants to become semi pro and then move to pro. A team that is willing to go to Lan events and has big dreams also a friendly roster with people willing to help each other will help me improve.
my dota 2 knowledge is not great i understand my support role 100% but my drafting skills are not too amazing so i will count on the captain to carry me in that area.
I have been around the dota scene for about a year now and i understand a year isn't much compered to others all i ask is for a trial and see what happens from there.
I have Teamspeak, Skype, Vent and of course Steam chat

First, great username. Bravo.

Second, we know. While Bale can say it's his dream to play for Real Madrid and be a Galactico, obviously money doesn't hurt to consider. I know it sucks that he's gone, that we will no longer get ""Bale'd out,"" whether it's for better or worse. However, let's pay our respects to what he has given to this club for the last 6 years. 6! I understand one club men like Ledley King, at the same time, if I spent a significant sum of time at a team that did not consistently bring in titles, I might be inclined to ply my trade elsewhere. Not trying to say you're wrong in any way, Bale definitely went for the money, but we need to be respectful and act like adults here.

TL;DR We love Bale, but this kind of thing happens. Let's keep our heads up.

edit: wanted to clarify. I'm not saying we're not going to bring home silverware and titles soon.

true,That_British_Kid,null,null,"I'll give a quick run down on my opinions of the teams ""top 7"" and where they'll finish...

1. Chelsea
2. City
3. Liverpool
4. United
5. Tottenham
6. Arsenal
7. Everton

Chelsea - Imo, the best squad in the prem now. A little weak up front (as in strikers - Torres &amp; Ba who are...*okay*), but aside from that, they kept Mata so their midfield is incredible. Their defence is pretty solid (except Terry. Fuck Terry) and they have Cech and Courtois (if they need to recall him). Also Mourinho is a world class manager. They've played well so far. I see them winning.

City - Again, world class squad, great few signings (Navas &amp; Negredo particularly). One weak area is GK - Joe Hart has been akin to Reina. No competition thus slipping in form. But I'm sure he'll want to up his game for the WC. They've played well (bar Cardiff) and I think it will be a good season for them.

Liverpool - Incredible transfer window. Ok so we didn't splash £30M+ on a striker/midfielder, but fuck it. We don't need to. We have Suarez (easily rated at £50M+), Sturridge in immense form, Coutinho (although been slightly disappointed so far, I can still see him being key for us), and Moses for the season. Toure by far the best value-for-money signings regardless of what people say about Ozil. Mignolet just behind (what a steal!). We've been pretty damn good at winning so far - even though we've been frighteningly poor at times. I can see us reaching even 2nd with a bit of luck and City collapsing more like they did against Cardiff. 

United - Poor against us. No real ""good"" signings. Fellaini will be a flop and looked like a massive panic buy by Moyes. Sure he wanted to bring in a player from Everton - fair enough - but there's no need for Fellaini and he doesn't suit the Man U style of football. Unless Man U are going to go to anti-football with long balls over the top almost stoke-esque. They've been ok but Moyes will crack under pressure. 4th is generous.

Tottenham - Great transfer window but they've lost the man who made their season last time. Without him a lot of their goals are gone. Even with Soldado &amp; Fernandinho. Their creativity came slolely from Bale last season. The chemistry he had with the rest of the team is not there with Soldado &amp; Fernandinho and it's quite clear. 3 games in - *no goals from open play*. They've been mediocre at best. Really unimpressive for a team that spent £110M. I can see them gelling around January and making a last-gasp attempt at 3rd/4th but they may well be out of it by then.

Arsenal - One marquee signing in the position they're strongest in will make very little difference. Wenger just added depth to a position they were already deep in. Admittedly their midfield is very strong now (Cazorla, Wilshere &amp; Ozil presumably) but their attack, defence &amp; GK are still gaping in terms of depth. With only Giroud as an out-and-out attacker, and Szcesny as a quality GK, you've got to question how wise dropping £42.5M on a player in your strongest position really is. Yes he will make them stronger. No, I don't think it will make them much more of a threat overall.

Everton - Just lost their best playmaker. Silly move by Martinez (although tbf Fellaini did request a transfer at the last minute). Only Baines is a quality player now. Rest of the team are pretty average. Would be very surprised if they finished higher than 7th. Could even fall into 8th/9th/10th behind teams such as Swansea or Villa. 

That's just my opinion. Far too much hype has been placed on Ozil. He's very good, yes. But he's not the saviour all the gooners think he is. ",0,1378165545,null,0,false,0,cc0j3eb,t3_1llpfq,t1_cc0j3eb,t3_1llpfq,null,1429611041,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

""I spoke with Brendan Rodgers several times and he told me: 'Stay another season, and you have my word if we don't make it then I will personally make sure that you can leave.  Now the story has changed. Liverpool is a club with a reputation for doing things the right way,"" Suárez says. ""I just want them to abide by the promises made last season."" 

The clause did exist, it was just somewhat nebulous.  To be frank, Suarez actually had a good point in that the clause required both parties to act in 'good faith negotiations' which one could construe that declining the bid outright was not exactly 'good faith' on our part.

The thing is, in general, we haven't been better with Suarez in the team.  The win/loss/draw record with and without him is pretty clear on that front.  I'm not saying he's a bad player.  Individually he's absolutely brilliant but this is not an individual-based game, it's all about the team.  Passing, link up play, effort, commitment to the cause- those things win us games and if Suarez doesn't want to be here (which he clearly doesn't) there is little to be gained in any of those areas by keeping him around.  

Like I said, I hope I'm dead wrong and Suarez comes back in, keeps his nose clean, stays out of trouble, stops talking to the press ever, everyone is happy on the pitch, he plays like a proper teammate should, we win the league and he decides he loves it here and ends up becoming a legend.

I've only ever had one driver ask for it and I used to order a lot, like at least once a week, when this one driver asked to see the coupon I ran up and down the stairs asking everyone in the house what happened to the voucher in the end the driver said no worries and it was fine. minimum spend is 35 quid, so you get £40 of food for 20, that will get you 2 large pizzas and 2 desserts, perfect if there's a lot of you to feed, or to stockpile and use to feed yourself for the next 2 days. If you order online and want to see what deals there are for online ordersjust Google ""pizza hut"" or ""dominos	"" ""voucher code"" then what month it is and the year, this is worth a try for anything you are ordering online.

 Moneysavingexpert.com is your friend, check the forums it has coupons posted all the time by it's users also sign up to their newsletter and keep checking it, there are some gems in it sometimes. Also the forums and newsletter will tell you what newspaper have coupons, sometimes a 30p paper can have a voucher for something worth a bit more. Like in the summer for example they might give away a  £1.10 icelolly free with the sun which costs 30p(though you'll have to buy the sun). Sometimes papers will have vouchers you have to col,ect over multiple days Also the crappy paper 'metro' you can find for free on most busses sometimes have things like a free coffee, so its worth scanning through on your commute

Bare in mind we have stricter rules when it comes to coupons(which we call 'vouchers') such as only 1 voucher for the same offer can be used per customer per transaction and not to be used in conjunction with other offers, so extreme couponing isn't really possible.

Taste card offer a free trial of 6 months I think, gives you half price in some reasturents, there's a list of what ones on their site.

quidco.com for cashback when you buy stuff online, if your planning on signing up for inernet , mobile phone, tv, electric, insurance or anything do it on there and you'll get quite a big amount of money back, though it does take around  6 months to get your money back.

There's a website, I think its my supermarket which will check your online grocery shop order and show you alternative products and offers that can save you money and will also compare the price of your basket between the different supermarkets.

If you are under 24 and will be needing a mobile orange do a deal for under 24's on a prepay sim card where if you top up 10 a month you get 2 gigs of data and 400 free texts as well as your £10 to spend, if your not under 24 you can get similar deals but with a bit less data and texts 

Hot UK deals is worth bookmarking, though a lot of the in store non online deals are things people have found in say one branch of tescos as a one off and you'll be unlikely to find in your local store

Also every supermarket has different policies but most will accept competitors vouchers.

true,mnmatt500,null,null,"&gt; Edit: It's also funny you say that the Americans were fighting dirty when it was British allies Sauk and British naval ships who Had attacked Americans after the treaty was signed. Dirty indeed.

I'd love a source to this because it is widely known that it  was Americans who started the battle after the treaty. 

Also on the same wikipedia page Historians either agree that nobody won, everyone was the 'real winners' or that Britain won and America didn't. 

Here: 

Historians' views

Historians have differing and more complex interpretations. Historians agree that ending the war with neither side gaining or losing territory allowed for the peaceful settlement of boundary disputes and for the opening of a permanent era of good will and friendly relations between the U.S. and Canada. The war established distinct national identities for Canada and the United States, with a ""newly significant border"".[188]

In recent decades the view of the majority of historians has been that the war ended in stalemate, with the Treaty of Ghent closing a war that had become militarily inconclusive. Neither side wanted to continue fighting since the main causes had disappeared and since there were no large lost territories for one side or the other to reclaim by force. Insofar as they see the war's untriumphant resolution as allowing two centuries of peaceful and mutually beneficial intercourse between the U.S., Britain and Canada, these historians often conclude that all three nations were the ""real winners"" of the War of 1812. These writers often add that the war could have been avoided in the first place by better diplomacy. It is seen as a mistake for everyone concerned because it was badly planned and marked by multiple fiascoes and failures on both sides, as shown especially by the repeated American failure to seize parts of Canada, and the failed British invasions of New Orleans and upstate New York.[189][190]

However, other scholars hold that the war constituted a British victory and an American defeat. They argue that the British achieved their military objectives in 1812 (by stopping the repeated American invasions of Canada) and that Canada retained her independence of the United States. By contrast, they say, the Americans suffered a defeat when their armies failed to achieve their war goal of seizing part or all of Canada. Additionally, they argue the US lost as it failed to stop impressment, which the British refused to repeal until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and the US actions had no effect on the orders in council, which were rescinded before the war started.[191][192]

A second minority view is that both the US and Britain won the war—that is, both achieved their main objectives, while the Indians were the losing party.[193][194] The British won by losing no territories and achieving their great war goal, the total defeat of Napoleon. U.S. won by (1) securing her honor and successfully resisting a powerful empire once again,[c] thus winning a ""second war of independence"";[195] (2) ending the threat of Indian raids and the British plan for a semi-independent Indian sanctuary—thereby opening an unimpeded path for the United States' westward expansion—and (3) stopping the Royal Navy from restricting American trade and impressing American sailors.[196]

[END SOURCE]

You are also forgetting that the British suffered fewer losses. And the idea of the tribal confederation was to not use them as soldiers but give you something to deal with after. It was precautionary in case it went tits up. But yes, they wanted to fight because they wanted to show that the British, while they were their allies, were not better than them.

&gt; I would say that Britain had lost its will to fight and America had no interest in continuing since it got what it wanted.

No, if Britain really wanted to continue they would have. They had Canada as a source of resources. 140 ships-of-the-line to use. America is just lucky we had an Empire. For without we wouldn't have also had wars in each of the four corners of the world. 

&gt; Even after the end if the Napoleonic wars[...]

You understand that the Napoleonic wars ended after the war of 1812? It's almost as if you don't understand the gravity of the Napoleonic wars. 

You understand that the only reason Americans remember the American battle wins in this war is because: 

a. Propaganda of patriotism 

b. It was shocking that they would actually beat the World's best. 

A majority of the battles in this war ended in stalemate or were abandoned by both sides. 

And saying that Sauk acted under British authority at the end is stupid. They just wouldn't accept that their tribe was doomed. They were shocked that we were leaving and were basically trying to encourage us to carry on but we had no interest. And upon the signing of the treaty we ceased all ties to Native American tribes.   

Also you're forgetting this is a sub where we praise Britain and only Britain. Just like in r/murica where they claim everything good is American and everything that isn't is 'commie' and that America is the best nation on the planet. Even though (and I'm speaking neutrally now) it isn't. ",0,1378167243,null,0,false,0,cc0jnwd,t3_1lki0w,t1_cc0jnwd,t1_cc0h1ta,null,1429610775,6,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,6

Sakho will challenge Agger/Kolo/Skrtel for starting places. Most likely it will be a rotation of Kolo &amp; Sakho with Agger holding LCB but when Agger needs a rest/gets injured Sakho will take his place and Skrtel will be rotated.

Ilori will provide some challenge for Lucas. Probably not too many starts - except against weaker opponents. But coming on when Lucas is tiring. Also will probably play with reserves/u21s a fair amount.

Moses will most likely be played on the left with Coutinho in the middle and Suarez on the right, with Sturridge playing as lone Striker. This will mean Aspas provides competition for Moses. Henderson provides competition for both Coutinho &amp; Gerrard (seeing as he can play either role) and then players such as Sterling will be pushing Moses &amp; Aspas to try and get game time as well.

Overall I think we've added a lot of depth. Multiple layers of cover in every position pretty much.

A bit worrying if both Glen and Kelly get injured for a longer time since they're both injury prone. 

Would be amazing if Wisdom too got a sexy loan deal where he could develop into a beast just like Borini and Suso got, but Kelly simply can't be counted on with injuries so we need 3 players for 1 position. Hoping we can get some proper cover for Glen in january so we can send Wisdom away then.

I guess now we wait until January to offload Skrtel and perhaps sneak another attacking player or a midfielder in the club. And of course, Coates too is off next summer no doubt.

Sturridge is fantastic. Quickly becoming one of my favourite players, but we can't keep relying on his goals. If they both remain fit, Luis and Danny can get 40 goals combined in the league **easily**. Add to that Moses and Aspas once he gets accustomed, that's 50+ goals we can realistically hope for just from the 3 front positions. If by some cruel twist of fate we'd sold Suarez today, we'd never have been able to replace those goals and we'd struggle to maintain our form over the season. Suarez gives us yet another ~~option~~ outlet up front, and a fantastic one at that.

true,13lah,null,null,"I'm not sure you're understanding my comment.  I was simply attempting to point out that the American War of 1812 was not a victory for the British in the way you were attempting to portray.  And you seem to agree since your last comment stated it was effectively a stalemate, which I also had stated.  Of course you can argue that the purpose of the war from the British perspective was to prevent an invasion of Canada which it did successfully.  However, you are completely neglecting British antagonism which fueled the desire to attack the British in the first place.  I doubt that the American populace would have had an interest in going to war had Britain not been stifling trade or abducting American sailors (yes I am aware of the ambiguity of this point as well).  So then from the American perspective, the war was an American success.  I think any reasonable person can understand then the reasons for considering it a stalemate.

&gt;You understand that the Napoleonic wars ended after the war of 1812? &gt;It's almost as if you don't understand the gravity of the Napoleonic &gt;wars.

On the contrary, I'm very aware of the impact on the Napoleonic wars in Europe.  I also understand that the War of the Sixth Coalition ended with Napoleon's abdication in April of 1814 which allowed the British time to transport veteran infantry to fight in America until hostilities between America and Britain ended in December of 1814.  The point here is that even with veteran troops and superior numbers the British were not able to pull off a decisive victory or gain any significant territory.

&gt;No, if Britain really wanted to continue they would have. They had &gt;Canada as a source of resources. 140 ships-of-the-line to use. America &gt;is just lucky we had an Empire. For without we wouldn't have also had &gt;wars in each of the four corners of the world.

Right, but that's the point. Britain *didn't* want to continue fighting.  It was exhausted from the Napoleonic wars and after two years of fighting had not achieved any significant success in America even with native and Canadian allies.  And further British wars at the four corners of the world was effectively a tactical error allowing an upstart like the American colonies to break off in the first place.  I'm not saying Britain didn't do exceptionally well dealing with all it's problems... on the contrary I doubt any other nation in the history of the world could have.  I'm saying that Britain had to make a tactical decision about whether or not to deal a regional issue of little importance to its empire.  And they chose not to not follow through with it *because it wasn't* important to them.

&gt;a. Propaganda of patriotism
&gt;b. It was shocking that they would actually beat the World's best.

About point (a), you're absolutely right.  Regarding point b, that's a mute point.  Britain had already been soundly beaten thirty years before.

He can play in one of three ways (as far as I see it):

Winger. Most likely and what most people on this sub seem to think/want. Probably on the right, with Moses on the left, Coutinho as a CAM/#10 and Sturridge as a lone striker. 

**Pros:** Incredible attacking power from both sides, with a proven poacher to get into the area and nab goals. Also ability to cut in from each side and Moses &amp; Suarez can always work magic and get their own goals.

**Cons:** Could end up with too many balls being played to the same flank (ie; Suarez's flank) and the defenders crowding him out. Suarez is also the best crosser of the ball (although I haven't see him do it much to be fair to him). So he is potentially wasted there. I have no doubt though that wherever we play him he'll work magic.

#10 - Taking Coutinho's place. Shifting Coutinho out to the left, Moses on the right and Sturridge as lone striker. 

**Pros:** So much attacking power straight down the middle (Gerrard &gt; Suarez &gt; Sturridge). Suarez &amp; Sturridge would be great playing off each other down the middle too. And Suarez has freedom to roam around more.

**Cons:** As with playing him on the flanks, I fear we would focus too much on giving the ball to him and going ""go on Luis, do something!"". This would be easily worked out by most defences and he'd be closed down quickly. I think we'd also see Coutinho go missing for long periods again. 

Striker - Playing Suarez as the lone striker, with Sturridge/Coutinho in behind, then moses &amp; the other on the wings.

**Pros:** Suarez can do anything as a striker. He is immense. Coutinho if played in #10 would be perfect for the through balls Luis thrives on.

**Cons:** Sturridge wouldn't be as prolific and I think he would be wasted. Coutinho could also again be wasted if played out on the left to allow Sturridge to play more central.


*Hopefully* we'll play him on the wings (probably left because then he can cut inside) and Coutinho will play behind Sturridge and Suarez &amp; Danny will both have 30-goal seasons and we'll win the league with 114 points.

&gt; For example, Congress supported President Reagan in the Falkland Islands crisis between Argentina and the United Kingdom. After Argentina in April 1982 seized and occupied the Falkland Islands, which the United Kingdom claimed as a crown colony, the U.S. executive branch sought to mediate the dispute. When Argentina refused one of the U. S. peace overtures, Secretary of State Alexander Haig announced that the United States would prohibit arms sales to Argentina and provide material support for British operations. Both Houses of Congress passed resolutions supporting the U.S. action siding with the United Kingdom.

I think Spurs handled our transfer business much better. You took a good offense and inserted a good player. We took a good player and traded it for a good offense. I think we get an A+ and you get a B. that being said... I'd really love to have fucking Özil.

true,oer6000,null,null,"From all that I've seen concerning the way we(Arsenal) play, a holding midfielder(in the destroyer mould) would be absolutely useless to us.

Our Midfield 3 succeed primarily due to their ball retention skills, with the two central midfielders doing a lot of offensive movement to 

a. Provide options for a passer and 

b. Put themselves in a better position to receive the ball. 

Examples are the goals we've scored over the past few seasons, most especially the goal we scored against you lot on sunday. The problem with this strategy is that when we lose the ball, our central midfielders are often in no position to immediately help with defense, which gives the impression that they don't ""track back"". Thankfully(or Sadly), this is an issue that is most exposed with teams that are the best at winning the ball and turning defense into attack, which is why Arsenal have performed relatively poorly against the top 3 teams in England in the past couple of years.

Most destoryer defensive mids rarely have good ball retention abilities and its why the ones that do are highly sought after. We've only had two ourselves in the past decade(Song and Flamini). 

**TL;DR: In other words, the only type of defensive mid we(Arsenal) need is one in such short supply that we're much better served by sticking with our current system.**

true,rydleo,null,null,"I'll caveat this with I don't like Suarez and I wish he had moved on, but even I would have a hard time saying a our current team without Suarez is stronger than with him.

That said, I do think there are serious question marks a) around Suarez's ability to integrate back into the team and b) whether he is a good fit for what BR is trying to do and c) whether results with Suarez would be better or worse.

For a)- at the moment we have a happy, smiling, drama-free squad who are top of the table.  Days before Suarez even steps on the pitch at Old Trafford, the questions will start bombarding BR and the negativity around the team will increase.  Will Suarez shake hands?  Will he bite someone?  Are his boots too orange?  Whatever it is, the press will make a meal of it and that wonderful feeling the team are now enjoying will likely be gone.  In addition, Suarez has been pretty outspoken about his belief that he is better than what the team can offer him at the moment- this is not something I imagine his teammates find endearing, nor his apparent belief that BR is something of a liar.  These are all valid concerns and I have no idea how things will play out with respect to the general vibe in the dressing room.

For b), Suarez does a lot of things very well, but a few things he does not do well are retaining possession of the ball, hold up play and bringing others into the game, and taking shots with a high probability of success.  All three of these items are key to the brand of football BR is trying to instill in the squad and, unfortunately, Suarez is often times wasteful as that's the nature of how he plays the game.  Can Suarez take it down a notch and perhaps try to become more of a team player instead of trying to do everything individually?  I don't know but I'm not convinced he can.

For c), we've clearly had a very good spell with Suarez sitting in the stands.  7 wins, 0 losses, and 1 draw in 8 games is an amazing feat for any club, much less one who is without their supposed 'best player'.  These results, in my mind, come about at least partially because the team is playing much more as a cohesive unit- closing down the opposition, working hard for each other, trying to pick out the open man, etc. and again, I'm not sure whether once Suarez is back in the squad we might not revert back to 'kick it to Suarez and watch him' ball in which case our results will not be as good moving forward as they have been lately.  The other factor I think is perhaps missing from this thread is that the decision wasn't Suarez or nothing, but perhaps Suarez leaving and having £45M to spend on new attacking players.  I think it could be easily shown that one or two targets in with Suarez gone could well have made a much more balanced, capable team than I believe the team is with Suarez.

All of that said, I've seen numerous posts on here say something like 'Sturridge is good, but Suarez is the best ever striker in the universe' or whatever.  Might I remind everyone that in 18 Premier League games, Sturridge has 13 goals and 5 assists for us.  Suarez had 6 goals and 5 assists in his first 18 games for Liverpool.  Sturridge has played very, very well for us and I cannot understand at all why people are seemingly belittling his contribution to the team (which has been far superior to Suarez's since he's come in the side- 13 goals and 5 assists to Suarez's 8 goals and 6 assists) whilst talking up Suarez.  Fair enough if you just like Suarez better because he's a flair player and is ""exciting"" or whatever, but based on contribution to the team Danny wins hands down and he's also has the notable benefit of actually wanting to play for Liverpool while Suarez wants to go play for anyone else, including our direct competition Arsenal.",0,1378176977,null,0,false,0,cc0n2nv,t3_1lm10d,t1_cc0n2nv,t3_1lm10d,null,1429609184,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Moses was Chelsea's best player in preseason, he's still young and he didn't get enough chances in a stacked Chelsea midfield. He'll come here hungry and eager to prove himself, and I think he's going to be terrific.

Sturridge/Suarez/Moses is terrifying. Coutinho in front of Gerrard and Lucas gives me a chub. I have no idea who our best CB combination is, Kolo/Agger were huge, I would have been happy with them but then Skrtel bent RVP over and made him his bitch this weekend. Now we get Sahko, whom I've never seen play to be honest but all I hear is how beast he is. Agger will definitely be in the first team, he's an unbelievable player and there's a reason Barca wanted to sign him, he's pure class.

Hopefully instead you can use independent thought and look at the evidence. I say one piece of evidence is that CFC have never made a serious public statement before. Do I believe his name was on some list and that they had casual interest in him, along with dozens of others? Sure I do, but it was never serious interest. If you don't want to buy that, then fine, there's more. The evidence is that all teams are allowed to put in bids prior to a medical being scheduled, so why didn't Roman's bid win then? 

The evidence is that Anzhi is owned by someone who has personal connections to Roman. The evidence is that the person in charge of Chelsea transfer negotiations is merely Roman's personal assistant going on 17 years, who Roman recently put on the Chelsea board (Marina Granovskaia, June 2013).

Hitting the gym won't make you lose weight unless you have a caloric deficit (i.e., the calories you put into your body are less than the calories that your body uses).

So...

Step 1) Work out your TDEE (there's a good calculator at 1percentedge.com/ifcalc - I'm doing that from memory, so hopefully that's right!)

Step 2) Take 500 calories away from that. A 500 calorie deficit per day will give you a weight loss of 1lb/week. It might not seem like much, but its the best way to make sure your muscle stays there. Also, half a stone in under two months still isn't anything to sneer at!

Step 3) Hit the gym. Lift some weights. Make sure you factor this into your TDEE. Maintain your caloric deficit to lose fat, keep lifting weights to be strong. You'll be ripped in no time.

I really recommend calorie counting for a little while. It's quite easy to get the hang of it, and get some idea of what you are (and should be) eating after a while, but starting from scratch means its a really good idea to count meticulously for a month or two.

You have to understand that in big picture, Tottenham are small potatoes compared to a team like Real Madrid.  I wouldn't be surprised if that ""partnership agreement"" was Spurs' idea when the Modric deal was done, as a cherry to put on the deal that would make us seem like a bigger player in the global football market than our resume would suggest.

Essentially, it's a way for us to sell our biggest player at the time, Modric, to the world's biggest football club and then on top of that we get an endorsement from that club saying how great we are to work with and how world-class we are, etc etc.

It's just marketing.  There's no contractual obligation for them to do anything at all, least of which avoid dealing with our rivals.  That would be ludicrous.  We're the kid brother in this arrangement, so the ""partnership"" means more to us than it does to them, make no mistake.  

So, this summer, when it came time for the Bale negotiations, they fulfilled all of their promises you quoted in the agreement above:

(1) Did they work together in respect to payers? yes. (2) Coaching? kind of irrelevant but sure. (3) Best practices? yes. if anything we dicked them over by dragging our feet on the deal. (4) Commercial relationships? they gave us more than $100M so I'd say that's a pretty solid commercial relationship.

They don't OWE us anything, again, other than the money agreed upon in the deal.  No favors. No pats on the back. Nothing.  And that's how it should be.  

We've had a couple of great years at WHL, no one can deny that, and things are more exciting for Spurs now than they have been in my memory, but we must remember we are just now knocking on the door of greatness, of true relevancy on a global scale.  Teams like United, Madrid, Bayern, Barca...they are powerhouses year after year...Champions League spots are seen as their birth right.  

We have a long way to go.  We need to stop acting like petulant little brats who take their ball and go home just because someone doesn't want to hold our hand. We don't need to make whiny posts calling other team's officials ""cunts"" every time someone does a deal with Arsenal.

You can argue till the cows come home, but fact remains Arse didn't address their primary issues at all during this transfer window and made a last-minute impulsive overkill buy to placate their little fans. 
It's irrelevant how good Ozil is, because creativity from attacking MF was not their weakness to begin with. On the contrary, it's arguably their strongest suit (with Cazorla and Walcott creating a butt-load of clear-cut chances). 
In fact, Cazorla (statistically) is nearly as good as Ozil (and that's considering he's plying his trade in the EPL (whereas Ozil is yet to prove he can replicate his La Liga form in England). 
So, no matter how you slice it, their deadline acquisition was tactically and practically (in terms of improving their weakest areas) almost useless. 
It did take the pressure off Wenger for a bit though, but I could care less about that, tbh.

It will lead to less embarrassment for you and a lot less time wasted for both you and the person correcting you. Plus, you come off as a cock when you try to blame your mistakes on other people.

&gt;Arsenal fans are acting like jesus has come down and put on an Arsenal kit with this signing. There is no denying that you lot seem to think he will upend the league and you will win everything that could be won this year. It's ridiculous how you're seeing Ozil. He's a top player and was playing a position perfectly suited to him at Real in one of the best squads in the world. He doesn't have those benefits at Arsenal. He'll be great, because he's a great player, but he won't automatically make Arsenal title challengers and you can damn well bet on them flopping out of the CL and the cups.

Again, this has fuck all to do with me. I never said Özil was going to win ""us lot"" anything. I never said I see Özil in any special way, I never said he will make Arsenal a title challenger and I never said he'd help us get farther in the CL or cups. You're criticizing points that have nothing to do with me or our discussion. 

You said something stupid and now you're getting defensive about it and attacking straw men. You've already explained how this misunderstanding was your fault so I don't understand why you didn't just leave it at that, rather than blow up in an irrelevant rant about what other people are doing elsewhere on the internet.",0,1378192568,null,0,false,0,cc0r5oy,t3_1llolh,t1_cc0r5oy,t1_cc0qypq,null,1429607184,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

I'm hoping that these stats and his own shooting percentages were skewed since he was being played (and acted rightly) as the team's sole goal-scorer. He had to create chances for himself, because no one else was going to do the job. Now that Sturridge has established himself, maybe that will free Suarez to wreak havoc on defenses without the weight of goal-producing responsibility, simultaneously creating space for Studge to finish. I'm certainly an optimist in this regard, but they seemed to work well together last season (don't have the stats, but you might remember the highlights), hopefully eight months on that relationship has only improved.

First of all let me say I think it's been an excellent window by us. The recruitment in has been fantastic but also getting rid of a few will help us too. Keeping Suarez is immense. 

I think there's more to do but I don't think you can do it all in one window. And we did as much we could. The way I see it out defense is sorted. Not just for the season but for a few years. 

That's huge. As much you can in reality, we can draw a line through the defense. That's fantastic. Now what happens? We look at attack and mid field. Currently (minus one suspension) we have two out the 3 top strikers in the premiership. While that can change at the drop of a hat with keeping Suarez we're relatively well stocked there. Loaning Borini was important and getting him game time in the premiership is a blessing. 

That leaves midfield. Allens first year wasn't the best but there were injuries and the birth of his kid that are simply out of control. I'll think we'll see more from him this year. Lucas is still I think getting right after his injury but the fact is if he needs to struggle through games to get his pre injury performances then it's worth it. He's that good. Henderson I may get slated for this but for me the turn around in his performances has been meteoric. He is stepping up. 

Gerrard is ageing but still defies his 33 years of age. Not that old I know but he's played top level football for almost fifteen years. He'll have bumps in the road. 

We have youngsters like Sterling, Ibe, wisdom who can contribute. And some much needed loans for Coady and Suso. If all goes well they could be part of the squad next year. Suso in particular looking like he's doing we'll and Adorjan seems to be going ok too. 

We are susceptible to injuries that's true but we don't have the resources to match other teams. We're building and building well with one eye on he future. The next few windows will be adding top quality to midfield and attack. At he start of he window we needed 6 top players for the squad. It's far less than that now. And we are building up the youths to be squad members too. Depth might not be a problem meaning you spend on those one or two big names that really take you up a level.

Nice to see Ben Bradshaw having a go at the ludicrous Pickles and his car free-for-all. 'The minister who might benefit most from cycling'.

Meanwhile, in the Chamber of the House of Commons, Eric Pickles is having his head kicked in by Ben Bradshaw.

Seriously, if the original tweeters want to say that then whatever, but for the APPG account to retweet them is just bizarre if they want to get people on our side. If you follow the link to the [article quoting Pickles](http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Anti-car-Cambridge-criticised-by-communities-secretary-Eric-Pickles-20130828060200.htm) you'll see he doesn't accuse cyclists of being elitist:

Mr Pickles told the News: “I accept there is a historic part of Cambridge that makes it not particularly friendly to cars and that’s the nature of having a very ancient city but, if we don’t put our plans together on how people live and how some of the elite think we should live, we are just asking for trouble.

Mr Pickles acknowledged historic buildings could not be destroyed to make way for cars, but said cyclists should not be given total preeminence in the way that car drivers were for many years.

He said: “What I’m seeking is not to replace one binding ideology with another, I’m asking for basic common sense and pragmatism.”


Is there anything wrong with that? If a campaign doesn't get basics right and throw insults at those who dare to question them then we won't get anywhere. And retweeting fat jokes when one of the main pluses is reducing obesity? Stupid.

btw in that Pickles article is says in Cambridge half the population uses a bike once a week. Fucking hell that's pretty amazing.

1. Until fairly recently automatic cars were less fuel-efficient than manual cars (they still are, but the difference is much smaller now). Given that our petrol has always been significantly pricier than in the US, that makes a difference.

2. Outside of cities, our roads tend to be small, winding, country lanes. Again, this is something that's changing these days, with ever-increasing numbers of dual-carriageway bypasses, but we're talking about historical reasons why automatics didn't become a thing. If you're driving down twisty windy country roads it's infinitely more enjoyable when you're fully in control of the vehicle. In an automatic roads like that become just unnverving, rather than exhilarating.

3. Our cars. At least until the 1970s oil crises, and really for a decade or two afterwards, American cars were big and heavy. This is still the case to some degree (think of the huge SUVs and flatbed trucks which are still common family vehicles in US households).

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"&gt;to claim selective breeding doesn't produce a stronger plant is just wrong.

When breeding you are dealing with pre-existing traits. You are not adding to the genetic structure that already exists there. So you look to find a plant with a trait you want and you breed that over generations to stabilize the trait. For you to create a highly potent strain you need to already have a highly potent plant with which to deal with.

&gt;now we're on the subject to say cloning produces the exact same plant is quite clearly a load of bollocks, DNA gets damaged

Erm... cloning _does_ produce the exact same plant. You haven't got a clue what you are talking about if you think you can end up with an improved plant over time simply by cloning.  This is a fact. Any damage or mutation is minimal and I think you greatly underestimate the resiliency of plants. I have read many reports of growers who have kept the same clones for decades, we are talking 30 years or more, and they continue to produce the same flowers.

Migrant workers work harder than locals for a pittance making sure minimum wage is no longer a viable income to live on. (Who can rent a house in London when 6 polish guys are sharing a house made for 3 people with the intention of going home with a nest egg). 

The fact they work for a pittance means strikes and striving for fairer working conditions becomes more impossible.

If you have a government mandated staff to baby ratio of 1:3, it is very difficult if you are in a non-affluent area (such as Cornwall) to run a successful business.  When the original minimum wage came in, my parents ended up having to fire one member of staff and move another.  The problem was parents simply couldn't afford the new price structure.  Previously, as was standard practice, they would use one in training with one who is experienced and qualified.  My parents were bad business people they cared about the children.

With the minimum wage coming in it simply wasn't possible to provide this service without making a substantial loss.  What a lot of the other businesses did was to switch to trainees and volunteers to bulk up the number of *staff* or simply, not take the younger little ones at all.

Removing tax from people who are earning on the lower end of the pay grade makes much more sense, there is no risk to businesses closing, the treasury has good figures for how much it will cost.  The fact someone who is earning minimum wage pays only about £180 of tax a year (vs say £1500 10 years ago, based on £10k per anum) is a much better way of helping those in lower paid jobs.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"The reason why Guardiola bought Mascherano is because he said he is one of the most composed central midfielders in the world. His entire theory was to adapt a smart midfielder into a central defender because it gets you the extra man in posession - you don't need Busquets or Xavi to drop back into the middle with lead out play. To play that role, you need someone like Mascherano who is more than the hard tackling style of player. 

Because of how Mascherano plays, hard charging and with a lot of spirit a lot of people overlook the very fundamentals of what makes him a good player: the ability to read the play, intercept or tackle but then in possession the ability to hold the ball up take his time to pick the right pass or relieve pressure after long periods of sustained attack.

Rushing back to make a tackle is the sign of a bad midfielder. you want to avoid having to make tackles through good formation, pressing, showing players wide or out, squeezing passing channels, forcing mistakes, etc. bring up the stats of a more ""traditional"" side like west ham or aston villa and you'll see their central midfielders make a lot less passes than ours and make lot more tackles while very few interceptions.

Were Mascherano on the pitch on the weekend he would have made a huge impact on that second half where a lot of our midfield transition play was rushed, and that was mostly because of a lack of link up and repositioning from the forward players (the weakest part of LFC at the moment is repositioning and spreading out the two banks after we regain possession, our average possession length in the second half on the weekend was less than 2 passes). 

Lucas has a similar set of attributes, but is much less consistent and his abilities in most of those brackets is just a little less, but he is no doubt still an excellent player.

Neither of these guys should be categorized as a defensive midfielder. I know fans like putting players into a box so they can compare them, but both Lucas and Mascherano (and Busquets, etc. and predecessors) offer a whole lot more than what the oversimplified characterization would suggest.

EDIT (From Wikipedia): Los Angeles is home to people from more than 140 countries speaking 224 different identified languages. Ethnic enclaves like Chinatown, Historic Filipinotown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, Little Ethiopia, Tehrangeles, Little Tokyo, and Thai Town provide examples of the polyglot character of Los Angeles.
According to the 2010 Census, the racial makeup of Los Angeles included: 1,888,158 Whites (49.8%), 365,118 African Americans (9.6%), 28,215 Native Americans (0.7%), 426,959 Asians (11.3%), 5,577 Pacific Islanders (0.1%), 902,959 from other races (23.8%), and 175,635 (4.6%) from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 1,838,822 persons (48.5%).

Non-Hispanic whites were 28.7% of the population in 2010, compared to 86.3% in 1940. Mexicans make up the largest ethnic group of Latinos at 31.9% of Los Angeles' population, followed by Salvadorans (6.0%) and Guatemalans (3.6%). The Latino population is spread throughout the city of Los Angeles and its metropolitan area but it is most heavily concentrated in the East Los Angeles region, which has a long established Mexican American and Central American community.

Usually I get really frustrated with people who argue with me. But you... you somehow made this enjoyable, thanks for that. 

Just a few discrepancies in your argument: 

Abduction of American Sailors, I thought it was believed that they were British sailors who couldn't cope with life on a British ship and didn't serve their agreed time so they were taken back to do so. (Yes I did see where you wrote about the ambiguity of the statement but I couldn't be sure as to what else you were alluding to.)

Where you mention the Veteran infantry. Exactly! They were veterans who had been fighting another war not long ago. They would take roles on ships and continue arduous training exercises in the meantime before arriving at America. 

Canadian Allies. Well technically as of this time they are British Allies. 

&gt; allowing an upstart like the American colonies to break off in the first place.

We didn't just allow it. We were fighting all over the place even then. We had just beaten France (fuckin' french frogs... &gt;:( always starting wars) we were fighting in india and we were fighting the Spanish as well as organising our colonies in (what is now known as) Canada. 

Just a little hypothetical for you. Understanding that Britain sent less troops in any battle of the war of 1812 than were present at your average battle in the N. Wars. Then you would know that had we not been fighting anywhere else America would have likely lost. 

Then again saying that I can't praise any of our Generals at all. Because the Army was ruthless in their training and the Generals knew the repercussions of not following the rules they did so absolutely in America. They weren't adapting to scenarios. For instance there were numerous battles in America in which 1,500 Regulars would land against a force of maybe 1,500 to 2,000 American soldiers. Now instead of using the upper-hand of surprise tactics or Rounding and dividing troops (as they had done in previous wars) they didn't they would wait for reinforcements, which meant the Americans found them. Which in turn means that they can fortify their position. 

The Generals made their job harder than it was. 

Arguably our most established General was the Duke of Wellington but he was not there. And our most esteemed Admiral (for years ago and years since) died 7 years before the war started. 

Also the Napoleonic Wars didn't end with the 6th coalition. It ended with the 7th when Napoleon escaped and the French were ready to fight again.  

That is to say the American win wasn't all down to British faults. No. There were many great Generals in the American Army. It probably took this war to show the British that their rules were not infallible and that they had to adapt to their surroundings. Which probably lead to the tactics used in the Battle of Waterloo.

Enrique needed competition. I may be in a minority in that I really rate him very highly, but he seems like a player who needs competition (and will respond and improve because of it).

Coady's out on loan and if he wan't I think he might be better employed providing defensive midfield cover. Gerrard and Lucas both often look tired after 60 and we don't have a great option from the bench to give them a rest. And we'll be deeply worried if either of them picks up an injury.

In that respect, Tiago Ilori excites me; even if his long term future is at the back, he's an all-round footballer who should be able to do a job wherever needed.

With Wisdom out on loan, and Coates injured in the long term, we've got Agger, Toure, Skrtel and Sakho as our experienced central defenders; two lefties, two right-footed if I'm not mistaken. Agger's been carrying a knock so this increase in strength hasn't come a moment too soon, and I don't see how it can be too much.

Then we've got three right backs (one coming back from injury, one freshly injured, and Flanagan) and two left backs (one injured). For all this depth, we're a little bit of bad luck away from a crisis.

1) There are schools that preach religion to their students, regardless of their own/family religion, which are funded by the government

2) Some of these state faith schools select and reject students based on their religion

The second one I think we can all agree is just plain discrimination. The state school is there to educate *all* children because it is paid for by *all* the people. You can't select your students based on race, you shouldn't be able to select your students based on faith.

The first one is more difficult. Given that a faith school shouldn't be able to discriminate based on faith, they must have students with a variety of religions. Teaching one particular faith, eg. christianity, in a school would be trying to convert those children to another religion against the wishes of their families, ie. the taxpayers. This is obviously not ok.

Children don't get sent to school so they can pray. They go to school to learn maths, english, science, music etc etc. Things that we *know* will put *every* child, regardless of race, religion or creed, in good stead for the rest of their lives if they study well. That is what we are paying for as taxpayers.

If a religious family wants their child to be taught religion, they can go to church, they can teach them at home. If they're rich, they can send them to a privately funded religious school.

Our state schools are paid for by *all of us*, so they should be suitable for *all of us*, not just the christians or the muslims or whatever.",0,1378204449,null,0,false,0,cc0sp5s,t3_1lkwrp,t1_cc0sp5s,t3_1lkwrp,null,1429606465,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

* Put your kid in a faith school which has a better academic record and will likely lead to better options for your kid in the future.

* Stick to your principles and put your kid in a secular school which has a worse academic record.

I think every parent will choose the former for the sake of their child's future. They would choose a good, albeit religious education over a worse education which could possibly scupper their hopes for university and employment years into the future.

An individual parent doesn't have the power to improve the secular school. It's up to the government to do it, and even if they do, it'll take many years and be too late for their child already.

Over the years, more and more parents meet the same choice and make the same decision for the personal betterment of their child's future. The good teachers want to teach at the school with the good students and the good students want to learn at the school with the good teachers. The faith school, which started off only slightly better than the secular school, is now miles ahead.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"There is actually a vaguely sensible answer to that. By military procurement terms anyway.

Because so much of the Fleet Air Arm infrastructure was based around the Harrier, replacing it with the F35B, which is the only similar thing planned, was considered sensible. Harriers didn't just operate from carriers, but from helicopter decks of Auxiliaries, large cargo ships, and clearing in the middle of the woods. It takes a shitload of fuel for them to take off vertically, especially when armed, but if you've got a tanker in the air nearby, it's not a problem.

It was the general overall versatility that was the benefit. The 'advantage' of the C carrier version over the B was largely range, but with mid-air refuelling, that's fairly moot.

The reason for the carriers being fitted 'for-but-not-with' cats and traps was because the ships were expected to outlive the F35 and be in operation for possibly up to a hundred years. 

The next generation of aircraft that would replace the F35 would almost certainly be unmanned, which bring several cost advantages. However, whilst carrier launched UAVs aren't too far off, fixed wing carrier UAVs that can take off and land vertically would require significant development. 

So having the potential for cats and traps wasn't *necessarily* just a fallback plan. And ordering F35Bs as a direct Harrier replacement to fill - and considerably improve upon - all of the roles it fulfilled and keep that versatility, wasn't entirely stupid either. Ordering the F35C as a cost cutting measure just didn't make sense. As a carrier aircraft, yes, it's better. Add air-to-air refuelling and the cost of railgun cats and the benefits and costs pretty much balanced out, or were worse, hence the u-turn.

I think that what *might* happen is that we'll still see a navalised version of the Typhoon. And *no* electric catapults. 

Because if the carrier can get 30 knots of wind over its bows, the Typhoon has enough thrust to take off on its own. The carriers will *probably* be able to do that under their own steam, but 15 knots of wind plus 15 knots speed is enough anyway. I don't *think* that Hornets can pull off this trick reliably. 

Rebuilding 25-30 of the first tranche of the RAF's Typhoons to a navalised spec alongside the tranche 3 upgrade would mean they could use the carriers and be ready as soon as the first carrier is.

If Britain had gone into Syria, or the global defence situation changes more quickly than the F35B will be ready in, I suspect this might happen. It's almost certainly being considered as one of the backup plans.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"First off....it was never supposed to be a ""partnership"" from everything i have seen.  That is why both Real and Spurs referred to it constantly as a ""special relationship"", the intention of the ""relationship"" was never to do anything that would suddenly increase Spurs revenue flow by getting additional funds from Real. There is no real benefit for Real to enter such a partnership, they are the biggest club on earth and generate huge sums of cash, Spurs are not on the same level as them and can't offer anything in terms of increasing Real's bottom line to a level that they would even want to enter a arrangement as such with us.  

The arrangement is in regards to some marketing considerations and probably some scouting collaboration.

The truth of the matter is regardless of what we call the the arrangement it appears to be nothing more than a right of first refusal for Bale. This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, when we entered into this ""arrangement"" most people assumed that this is exactly what it was set up to do. 

For anyone to assume it was an arrangement that would stop Real from selling to Arsenal is horrifically naive. There is no benefit to Real to make any such commitment.  Why would Real cut off their right to deal with a club like Arsenal who have a massive amount of money? Arsenal hadn't shown a history of spending money on players (and neither had we) but they have a huge sum of money available so in theory they could spend at some point. To enter an agreement with Spurs that would take a team like Arsenal off the table for Real wouldn't make sense, (historically) Spurs can't offer the potential monetary benefits that Arsenal can. To enter a arrangement that would cut Arsenal out of a deal would cost Spurs a hell of a lot more than selling our players at inflated prices to them.

Real had every right to sell a player like Ozil to anyone they wanted, if we had the cash and could have convinced Ozil to come to Spurs we would have had the same opportunity to buy him. So would United, Chelsea, City, PSG, Liverpool, AC Milan, Inter Milan, Juve or Bolton.  The only teams that Real would hesitate to sell to would be Barca or Athletico...and that is because their fan base would go ballistic not because their money is in anyway less valuable or desirable. If the tables were turned Levy would turn around and sell a player to Barca without hesitation.

Arsenal made a hell of a signing in Ozil, the guy is fantastic and will help Arsenal. I wish they hadn't signed him. But this assumption that somehow Real weren't supposed to sell to them is ridiculous.  It makes us seem entitled to have our business dealings fall outside the realm of normal business.

We didn't put Eriksen shirts up in our stores, we didn't set aside a jersey for him, didn't go to the media telling them how Eriksen is wasting himself at Ajax and needs to come to spurs etc.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;The problem is they planned for what caused this debacle. 

Not strictly true.

The carriers were always designed with a catapult conversion in mind, but the specs for an EM catapult did not exist. They used the known requirements of a steam catapult design as a baseline and left it at that.

Jump forward to 2010 and with the F35-B in trouble (and rumoured to be about to fall victim to the US defence budget cuts), the Government made the switch to the F35-C, announcing that they'd buy the EM catapult design off the Americans. This also fit well with the new philosophy of resource-sharing with the French and Americans, as we'd be able to fly off each other’s flight decks, and give the carriers the potential to launch marine UAV's in the future.

This was extremely late in the day to be changing the design however; it took nearly 12 months of study to understand the full cost implication of converting the carrier, and by the time the decision came to reverse the design change (about 8 months later), the impact of first change had only just finished filtering down through the design teams.

It turned out that the EM catapult design nearly completely invalidated all the original assumptions about its requirements made at the beginning of the program. Extensive modifications would be required to parts of the vessel already fabricated and on their way to the assembly yard at Rosyth.

What's more, the UK government announced their intention to the system prior to entering negotiations with the US manufacturer, allowing little room for dealing. The US refused to share any of the development work, and the catapult system would need to be re-designed from the configuration intended for the Ford class due the smaller size of the QEC flight deck.

These projects are simply too massive to make major 11th hour design changes; the momentum that’s involved in shifting course is immense. It isn't easy to change the design to save money, because the act of changing the design will likely cost you even more once the production process has reached a certain point.",0,1378210116,null,0,false,0,cc0tibi,t3_1lmpv8,t1_cc0tibi,t1_cc0ruja,null,1429606087,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

There is nothin inherently offensive about that statement, it's just a fact. Now I am of the opinion that this plays into why /r/gunners has so many subscribers. This is because when these young men were just starting to take an interest in soccer, the best team happened to be arsenal. Now if I was around 10 years old, I'm not going to pick some team that doesn't win, where's the fun in that?

Don't forget that that 30 knots is the maximum required, just for the time it takes to launch aircraft, in completely still conditions. If there's a 30mph wind anyway, the carrier doesn't need to move. 

The Typhoon takes off at about 150mph. Because its thrust levels are so high, that means it can get to 120-ish, before the end of the carrier. So if you add a 30mph headwind - or the carrier moving too - and a ski jump to give it a bit of extra height to accelerate in once it's off the front, and taking off without a catapult can be done.

I can't be arsed to work out the maths of the acceleration factor, but if you think of the Top Gear episodes where Typhoons have raced Bugatti Veyrons and think of how long it takes it to get to 120mph and how far, you'll see how it works.

By comparison the Super Hornet is heavy and underpowered, but it's comparable to the idea of a navalised Typhoon, because it essentially came about as a modification of an existing aircraft to meet new needs when other proposed planes were cancelled.

true,ebilutionist,null,null,"&gt; I know Cazorla plays out wide, but that doesn't make him a ""wide player"" in that he doesn't add width to the team; like the NLD this weekend where he played ""wide left"" but was pushing so far to the right that he ended up next to Walcott on several occasions.

He adds balance to the wings, and his drifting inside allows Gibbs forward on the overlap; the latter is the one that provides width. In the NLD, this proved vital because we effectively had a spare man in midfield - Michael Cox of Zonal Marking explains this extremely well (http://www.zonalmarking.net/2013/09/01/arsenal-1-0-tottenham-cazorla-provides-the-overloads-in-midfield-and-the-through-balls-for-giroud-and-walcott/).

&gt; Podolski is already out until Christmas, most likely, and if Walcott gets hurt, you're going to be looking at an Arsenal team with almost no natural width; Cazorla &amp; Ramsey are good players, but they won't give a team any width.

The fullbacks provide width, and Walcott pulls wide occasionally and sends crosses in - a good example is his assist for Giroud's goal in the derby. I don't see a problem with width. I do agree we lack strikers, but Özil is capable of playing as a false nine (he did this against France, I believe) and thus, adds a fascinating tactical option to Arsenal's... um, arsenal. 

&gt; And no, probably Arsene couldn't find a player who was ""better"" than who you had; but given you have 2 fit CB's, you didn't need an ""improvement"" you needed a body. And that's where Arsene fails; he is a constant optimist about players getting healthy, even in the face of their history.

We have Sagna, who is extremely capable at playing there. Jenkinson is decent enough to play at RB nowadays. Besides, Flamini is also an option.

I don't mean any offense, and I certainly don't wish to antagonize any Spurs fans here (I didn't comment hoping for a fight) but I must say that it seems that you sound like you're in denial. It certainly doesn't seem like you know our playing style very well.

PSG stuff is a rumour, so not sure how true.

He was on track to become the best 10 in the world 2 years ago, falling away from that isn't the end of the world. He still scored/assisted 27 times in 33 matches last season, plus 5 times in 6 CL games (against Dortmund, Real Madrid and Manchester City).

Eriksen got 53 goals/assists in 66 games in last two years of Eredivisie. He got a goal/assist in 80% of his matches

Their business strategy with the very young was to take a loss / no profit, with the hope that in 12 months they would turn in to a more profitable age category, before getting old enough to be in the profitable age category.

I am not going to disclose their business information, but they ceased trading almost a decade ago, against my advice they didn't declare bankruptcy and used their home equity to pay redundancy packages for the staff who were eligible, my mother also helped a lot of the younger ones get their new jobs (she was originally secondary school dep head).

Now you show your complete ignorance by assuming the cost of a staff member is their hourly wage.  It isn't.  Plus you show ignorance of the business by assuming you just pay for an hour, you can not expect staff to live so elastically to demand.

You also can not have a perfect 1:3 ratio unless you were running some kind of childcare ranch.

I suggest taking your head out of your arse a bit, and thinking about the numbers involved.  Yes my parents were terrible business people, yes they had many other flaws in their business plan (not to mention the whole part of caring for children, terrible industry if you give a shit about care).  Did the minimum wage kill the business?  No, the schools handling of the childcare vouchers did that as schools were allowed more profitable ratios for the 3-5 age, many suggested if they wanted a guaranteed place at the oversubscribed primary school that you live miles away from (Cornwall!) you'd better get them in the pre-school program, so they'd feel at home.

Sky sports even contacted Chelsea yesterday evening who responded that they hadn't had any contact from PSG and reiterated that he wasn't for sale.

The whole thing is just pointless stories spread by tabloids because Mata hasn't played much this season, but from the lack of play time in pre season due to injuries and how clearly out of fitness he looked against Aston Villa it seems clear as day that when Mourinho says that he isn't match fit he's telling the truth. 

The whole squad is set up so that we have at least 2 ""quality"" options for each position which is why we now have 6 attacking midfielders for the 3 roles behind the striker and is why when having signed Willian we were over stocked, Moses was sent out on loan.

If Chelsea has any slight urge to have sold Mata then we would have not only been selling potentially Chelsea's best player and a massive fan favourite but also leaving a hole in the squad. Therefore, it would of made no sense what so ever. 

Unless reported by a reliable source I would pay zero heed to any football rumors. People are just trying to get people to buy papers or visit their websites by printing hyperbole and they love nothing more than putting 2 and 2 together and getting 3.

true,podpool,null,null,"Everyone has strengthened somewhat really.

Here's how I think teams will finish:


1. Chelsea - On paper I think look very strong, in saying that I'm surprised they didn't sign another top class striker Eto'o is getting on, not sure how good he actually is. More surprisingly they let baby Drogba, Lukaku go on loan. I think he could well have done the business for them this season. In midfield they are very very strong, not many problems at the back either. Definite title contenders for me.

2. City - They look quite shoddy at the back without Kompany, you expect them to dominate and they don't really. Against Cardiff they were poor, against Hull they weren't massively convincing even though they won. Hull had a few chances to score on the break. However with Pellegrini, I expect the to get much better as the season progresses.


3. United - I think they lack spark in midfield. I can see RVP becoming as frustrated against us in more games this season. The change in manager and the lack of a creativity in midfield, they will be up there but I don't see them winning the league.


4. Liverpool - Before the end of the window, I felt we were a defensively short. We've addressed that now and then some. Moses was a shrewd deal I think he will definitely add something. Mignolet, nothing to be said - top class. The squad looks 'full' and healthy with good competition in the majority of the places. It feels like we have trimmed the fat and replaced it with some quality. And with Suarez to come back and the recent run of good results (although only by 1-0 scorelines, chances wasted!), the defence looking rock solid. I really think we can mount a decent challenge for top four this season.

5. Spurs - Lost Bale and with it a lot of goals. They have signed good/very good replacements, however the most recent of signings have never played in the league before, that has to be of concern. They will take time to gel together. One worrying thing for them is, they haven't scored from open play in the league yet. Despite the signings I think they will struggle to gain back Bale's goals.

6. Arsenal - First team on paper and probably in reality is top draw. With the addition of Ozil their starting midfield is potentially brilliant, fluid and full of creativity. Giroud is looking like a player at last too. However in signing Ozil, I still think they haven't strengthened anywhere near enough. Their defence is weak I feel.

My father always belittled everything I was taught in school and forced his beliefs (or lack thereof) on me and my sister. When we stayed with him, he would always say ""Jesus and God don't exist"" when putting us to bed.

The gripe with him for Madrid (and the reason Isco was preferred) is because for all of his industry and ability he can struggle to really take hold of a game. Expect some nifty flicks, clever passes, and excellent movement, but only for about 60-70 minutes and only if the rest of the midfield protects him.

He barely got the protection he needed with Alonso and Khedira behind him, what do you think is going to happen when he's in a midfield with nothing but 145 lbs 5' 7"" players (Ramsey, Wilshere, Arteta, Cazorla, Walcott)? The tactic is clearly going to be to stick your enforcer on him and rough him up a bit, and I'm not entirely sure he'll be able to play the game he loves to play so long as you stick to that tactic.

He may be a 9, but Cazorla was already an 8 for the same position and he doesn't really offer Arsenal much more than what they had before. They already had excellent ball movement and slick passing.

1) Controlling possession hasn't always given us the wins. Remember the 3-2? or the 2-1?

2) Spurs have better ball playing players now. Spurs midfield for me have always been their weakness but with Paulinho, Capoue and Dembele they had a midfield capable of holding on to the ball longer.

I'd also like to add that we played a similar way in all our wins this season, home and away. The only game where we actually were in complete control was the Villa game, ironically.

And since we're being civil, I'd like to add that I think this Spurs team looks very very good. This is definitely a team capable of champions league football, or at least CL standard.

But these players will need time to gel, and by the time that happens the league might have run away from you.

Also, you'll have problems getting goals. Soldado makes great runs but you don't have the midfielders to pick him out. I was more worried when Defoe came on because Defoe can score out of nothing while Soldado thrives on good service, and he wasn't getting any good service.

I also think one or two players will not be suitable for the PL. Chadli reminds me a lot of Gervinho.

My dad and I were driving up towards Gatwick Airport and were darting along some country back roads to short-cut all the major usual congestion. 

We came around a long bend in the road and came across a hatchback spewing blue-ish smoke and making one hell of a row. The thing is that the driver of this thing was determined to go at at least 50mph and the car was obviously not happy. 

Dad tried flashing his lights a few times over the course of about a minute with no response. We reached a long, straight, empty patch of road and he sped up with the intent of signalling to this person their car was about to die. 

As we pulled level the woman driving this thing clocked us and tried her hardest *not* to let us pass - something we weren't trying to do - but the noise from her car was incredible. 

Suffice it to say (with a small amount of pride, and the fact we had a working car) my dad was able to drop our car into a lower gear and race round her, before chucking on the hazard lights and successfully signalling the problem with her car - she broke to a halt soon after. 

Long story short? A hell of a lot of effort to get across a very obvious issue and with little acknowledgement that we'd probably saved her a sticky end! ",0,1378217008,null,0,false,0,cc0v00v,t3_1ln3uv,t1_cc0v00v,t1_cc0uwlz,null,1429605391,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Are you suggesting that the price of goods/cost of living will simply increase to compensate with people's new disposable income? That's an interesting thought (and may lead to increased inflation, making things potentially worse). Maybe as long as there is enough competition among many different companies providing goods and not a small number of massive companies that can set their own cartel then prices wouldn't rise?

&gt; what is you moral justification for steal others property to give to those who haven't earned it?

Income size isn't based on deservedness; some people work exceptionally hard and continue to earn a low income and vice versa. If wealth redistribution is necessary for the prosperity and happiness of the majority of humans then it should happen (and I'd strongly suggest that it is).

true,PhuQDuP,lfc99,,"1. Chelsea - Scary team, They are incredibly solid defensively and I am so worried we won't be able to break them.

2. City - Another scary team with one of the scariest attacks in the world. They scare me simply because I think they'll outscore us.

3. Liverpool - If it weren't for our reputation of the last few seasons, anyone looking at our squad would see we are very solid all the way through. We beat the Champions without Mignolet being TOO troubled. I know it's the bane of all Liverpool fans but I have really high hopes for this season.

4. Arsenal - Ozil is going to carry them. Their midfield is quite scary looking in my opinion but I think they've probably got the worst choice of keepers for the top sides. But as a team they have been together forever and you can really see them link up quite well. I'm looking forward to our matchup with them, I think it's going to be an excellent game. The reason I put them lower than us is I think they've got really shitty depth. 
5. Manchester United - Moyes has not impressed me at all, These lot were champions last year and they really don't look like it on the pitch. They have a very old squad who are past their prime, they refuse to give younger players game time (Chicharito deserves way more respect than he's being given). I think they'll probably drop points against each of the top 6 at least once. This all goes out the window if they make like 3-4 big surprise signings in January.

6. Spurs - They''ve made fantastic signings but, and correct me if I'm wrong, their XI, apart from the two fullbacks, is completely different to the XI of 2 years ago. Also, their wide players (FBs and wingers) are very average. They also are yet to score from open play, they won 6 points from penalties AND one of those penalties was a dive (I know they should have had a penalty earlier in the match but two wrongs don't make a right).

As I said in my previous prediction, I think the gap between 3-6 is going to be insanely tight.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"I don't know if you are trying to be obtuse, but the biggest costs was a parent not bringing their child in.

That cost is directly relational to the costs of staffing, however, given ratios, its a complex function.  4 children is a serious loss, 5 just about OK, 6, well sadly that practically never happened.

You say it's easy to bare the increase in this cost, it wasn't without sacrificing the quality of the product.   The normal operating was to have about 1000 baby days of care, this was also seasonal, because, Cornwall.  As you can imagine, by far and away the biggest outgoing was staff wages.  Trying to keep them lined up for parents.

Parents didn't like the idea of having a 6 month guarantee of attendance for their baby, even when offering a 33% discount.

So whilst the biggest cost, is due to ratio not lining up nicely.  The biggest outgoing is staff wages.  If you imagine my parents were charging the most money they could, in over 10 years of running the nursery, they made a loss on each baby of about £150.  By comparison, each older child would on average make a profit of around £500 per year.  Licensed for up to 60, that makes a business which can make if very lucky £30k a year.  Or less than my mother earned as a teacher.  Now if you consider to make that £30k, some 18 people employed (excluding parents) with roughly a total hours of 45000 per year, it is very easy to see that a wage change of 50p an hour, would put them quite heavily into the red if the nursery was running along at 70% capacity.  This was often the case.

Yes, this is an outlier, childcare is a piss poor business to be in, and yes, my parents were not good business people (if good is making money, rather than caring for children).  But try and have some perspective of that industry.

- Give the body some rest and do not put it under pressure

- Eat good food

- Keep training lightly and working out so the muscles don't forget what they are going to be used for

- Slowly introduce the player back into the squad (Jose tried that but Mata looked extremely bad which is why he stopped and will try again)

Rushing a player in this situation can have negative long term side effects throughout their career including long term injuries. This has happened to Essien earlier in his career and we saw what happened to his long term career all because he was not properly cared for.

Mata is one of the most valuable players at Chelsea. He is our future and if we rush him out now just to secure points he is not going to be the player he can become at Chelsea. 

Why do you think Arsenal players get injured at a slight breeze? Their medical staff is horrible. They get young players and when those players are going through stages like these they rush the player out. At that moment some players seem to be fixed and some get injured again but the damage is done. Then after a season or two the player gets injured every odd week and having a bad medical staff they cant even care for them properly and only make things worse.

We might as well drop a point or two than to risk Mata. That is how valuable he is. Jose understands that, no manager, not even the worst of the worst would not realize how good Mata is.

Enrique has always been a great player let down by mistakes. Now he has competition in Cissokho to keep from making those mistakes, and Cissokho is no slouch defensively either.

Johnson is kinda similar, but looked fantastic against United. He also has competition with Kelly (once he's back to full fitness) and a constantly improving Wisdom.

CB is probably our strongest position at this point. We've seen Agger, Toure, and Skrtel all do amazingly well so far this season. And Sakho is highly regarded. Ilori and Wisdom look great for the future, too.

Lucas is one of the best DMs in the PL. Gerrard helps significantly in defense. And Henderson is definitely earning his place in the starting XI. He played a big part in shutting down United.

true,lbspredh,null,null,"&gt;When breeding you are dealing with pre-existing traits. You are not adding to the genetic structure that already exists there. So you look to find a plant with a trait you want and you breed that over generations to stabilize the trait.

well I'm sorry but that simply doesn't match up with the facts, selective breeding with plants is the same as with animals, in Africa they breed rhinos to have much bigger horns than they have in the wild for the ivory, if they were only securing the trait how come the horns have gotten so much bigger? while it is true that no genetic material is added every new plant is different(even clones but I'll return to that shortly) through mutation, if you pick the most potent plant over every generation you will eventually get a more potent plant.

&gt;Erm... cloning does produce the exact same plant.

Erm... cloning does produce an exact copy yes.... of the specific part of the specific plant at a specific time, which will not be the same as a parent parent plant because the DNA is damaged(IE it mutates)

&gt;This is a fact.

no it's anecdotal and scientifically unsupported at best

&gt; Any damage or mutation is minimal and I think you greatly underestimate the resiliency of plants. I have read many reports of growers who have kept the same clones for decades, we are talking 30 years or more, and they continue to produce the same flowers.

well yes they aren't suddenly going to sprout different coloured flowers, then you have to consider that if the intention is to produce very similar plants all you have to do is pick the parts of the resultant plants that are closest to the original clone. like I said you can strengthen the plant by picking a trait

even if I do accept what you say about cloning being an exact copy(let me reiterate it's wrong) growers who want to produce will grow from a clone because it is more likely they will get pretty much same plant they cloned and the results should be more consistent. However the people developing these breeds will pick seeds since they are actively trying to produce a stronger plant by selective breeding, which is well documented to produce offspring with noticeably stronger traits over several generations.

After that, the next 4 squads line up very evenly. Spurs might seem like the best on paper, but I have a ton of doubts on how all of those players are going to do in this league. If 1-2 flop, its back to being average, minus Bale. Arsenal has glaring holes in their lineup even with Ozil, but 4th may be obtainable still.

United look as confused as we did at the start of last year. Moyes style + bringing in Fellaini insures that they are going to play closer to how Everton did under him. I think that is seriously going to cause some problems. Moyes also seems much less adaptable tactically than Rodgers. I can see United drawing a ton of games the way Everton does.

Many people have ideas. Many people want to be writers. The key to actually becoming a writer is quite simple: you have to write. I have a friend who, after many years, finally got a book published this year. He writes 2000 words a day, without fail.

That's the kind of commitment it takes to get good at writing.

Write every day. Maybe not 2000 words, but something. Write short stories, write a novel, write scripts. Write poetry. Read - and not just the genres you like. Read everything, as much as possible. Keep a notebook and pay attention to the craft of writing while you read. If you see something you like, some technique that was clever - write it down.

**Hodgson facing England injury crisis as Johnson and Jones join Rooney on sidelines with Caulker called up to face Moldova and Ukraine**

Roy Hodgson faces a major England injury crisis which threatens to derail his World Cup qualifying plans. 


Wayne Rooney, Phil Jones and Glen Johnson are all ruled out of the double-header against Moldova on Friday and Ukraine a week on Tuesday as the Football Association called up Cardiff central defender Steven Caulker. 


England also have a major doubt over in-form Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge, despite his match-winning performance against Manchester United at Anfield. 

The England manager's mood was not improved when what was described as an 'administrative mix-up' meant Hodgson was unable to gain access to the chairman's lounge at Liverpool after he turned up to watch the 1-0 win over United. 


United striker Rooney had already been ruled out for three weeks after suffering a bad gash to his head during training at Carrington on Saturday after a collision with team-mate Jones. 


Jones and Johnson picked up ankle injuries in Sunday's game while Sturridge, who scored Liverpool's winner against United, is struggling with tightness in his thigh. 


There was yet another scare for Hodgson when talismanic Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere was substituted with what looked like a recurrence of his ankle problem during the Gunners' 1-0 North London derby win over Tottenham at the Emirates. 


But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger later revealed the 21-year-old midfielder was simply suffering from a stomach bug and would be fit to join England. 


The news on Rooney was not as positive. United manager David Moyes said: 'Wayne is bad. The cut is right in the middle of his forehead. It was a boot by Phil Jones which caught him down the forehead. He will be out for three weeks, I'd expect.' 


Moyes said of Jones: 'It's a bad twist to his ankle.'


Liverpool counterpart Brendan Rodgers described Johnson's injury, sustained after a clash with Patrice Evra, as 'not good' and Johnson left the stadium on crutches. 


Sturridge, who celebrated his 24th birthday on Sunday, is also far from certain to be involved. He had been nursed through the build-up to the big game and was seen pointing to his thigh as he came off during the pre-match warm up. 


But that did not stop him producing another impressive performance as he scored for the third Barclays Premier League game in a row to seal Liverpool's third 1-0 victory from their first three League games of the season. 


Rodgers is eager to protect his striker and could be on course for a row with the FA after the Liverpool manager insisted his club would be Sturridge's main concern. 


'We just need to assess him,' said Rodgers, whose side are top of the table after their best start to a season in 19 years.
 

'He wasn't sure he was going to make this game. He had struggled for the last couple of days. We will see how he is but we need to make sure we think of Liverpool first



'I suspect that, with his quality, Roy will be looking to start him (against Moldova and Ukraine). But the priority is Liverpool and we need to make sure that he is OK. If he is OK, he will go to England. 


'I'm delighted with Daniel's application because he was nowhere near fit. He played a full game, then extra time, in midweek. He had a slight knock on his thigh

'We have just said, ""Put yourself out there at 75 per cent and you will be as good as, if not better than, most strikers"". He did that and he got his reward. There is no doubting his qualities.'
 

Sturridge, who has opened the season with five goals in four games after two in the Capital One Cup win over Notts County, said: 'It was great to have (Hodgson) here. I had a problem with my thigh before the game and it is still hindering me but I hope I will be OK for the squad.'
 

Embarrassed Liverpool were quick to apologise to Hodgson, who had an unhappy six-month spell as manager at Anfield in 2010-11, over the matchday issue. He sat in his usual seat, in an area reserved for scouts, and watched 85 minutes of the game.

true,pharao007,null,null,"Don't compare natural chemicals with those which were produced in labs or extracted from some plants as without human processing you wouldn't be able to use them (probably excluding chewing tobacco leaves). We use drugs (medicines) but that's entirely different as medicines help with pain and actual problems, they are not used solely to have fun only because a person wants to go to another level of fun or isn't capable to enjoy life due to some problems.
Even if drugs don't have bad medical effect in short or long term (obviously plenty of them have) and even if you are strong enough not to get addicted to some of them or even go for harder ones later on it is still wrong to use them for a reason they are fake and of a kind of short-cut in life. You want to have fun, so you get high. You want to earn more money, you steal. Not greatest example but that's the whole idea of cheating in life.
Drugs, alcohol and tobacco destroyed millions of lives and they still continue doing it. By saying responsible (as you may say), there will always be bigger or smaller margin where people aren't responsible with the use of certain substance. Increasing its popularity you only increase such margin. I never understood why people knowingly harm each other but that's probably how most of the society behaves, they just act and very often don't use their brains - showing our animal-type behaviour on visceral level, where short term goals are more important than long ones.
I am most probably with minority but my belief is real and it follows quite simple life goals, where I try not to harm myself but at the same time also lead a pretty decent and fun life.
Also, don't forget that scientific research takes a lot of time. If certain drug is supposedly not harming someone's body for now, this may change in the future. The will to live shows its strongest point just before losing a life but then it's too late to realise the mistakes which could lead to such quicker ending.
One more thing, I don't judge anybody but most probably and statistically speaking, people who use drugs/alcohol and even tobacco have problems in life which they can't resolve. As some problems will always be in every person's life, that is why we see so many (and with increasing numbers) people getting hooked on some substances. Even if they don't have real problems, they can have a problem of for example being too rich, where money just tells some people to ""enjoy life"" in full, thus use such substances.",0,1378222066,null,0,false,0,cc0whin,t3_1lkeut,t1_cc0whin,t1_cc0v2m8,null,1429604698,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

b) I really don't feel people are giving the Spurs squad enough credit.  Maybe I'm being pessimistic but I don't count them as contenders for fourth but first this season.  Everyone seems to think they need to gel, but they won as well as we did in each of our first two games.  I'm very happy with our squad, but the quality on their bench will come into play eventually.

true,Jamaicaman90,swans1995,1912,"Here are some of my personal thoughts:

**INS:**

* **Bony**: No doubt our new, Premier League Jason Scotland. His style is very reminiscent, but with Michu now behind him the pairing look capable of carnage. I think if you only watch highlights, you may end up questioning his contribution when he doesn't score - however, his movement and strength from what I have seen can cause problems for opposition defences, and he looks capable of disrupting lines and creating space for our attack without touching the ball. Also, he allows Michu to go back to his preferred (and obviously far more effective) position behind the main striker, rather than being up top himself.

* **Shelvey**: He's looked good in every game except for the three in the league. Hopefully with a good run of games, he will get better. His eye for attack is superb, and his diagonal balls are often fantastic. The downsides are that those diagonal balls are by nature a higher risk of losing possession, and his defensive play looks quite shaky right now. He could end up being a match-winner or a match-loser, and I'll be watching his development keenly.

* **Cañas** He looks like a natural successor to Britton. I expect him to share the load with him this season, and make the position his own in the coming years (should he stay, of course). Solid signing and brilliant business on a free.

* **Pozuelo**: Many are lamenting missing out on Nathan Redmond, but from what I've seen of this young lad so far I think he is an equally good purchase, at a fraction of the price.

* **Álvaro**: While I'm usually quite good with my La Liga knowledge, for some reason I don't know much about this guy. He didn't have the best of times at Getafe, but looked very promising at Espanyol. That being said, he only spent a year at Getafe before coming here, so it hasn't necessarily stalled his development. We've got a good record of getting the best out of players that need a boost (Routledge anyone?), so I'm not too worried.

**OUTS:**

* **Ki**: While I'd rather we didn't help our league rivals like this, I can see why it's happened. He's a promising player, but personally I don't think he'd get many minutes this season, not while Britton is still going strong. Letting him rot at this point would do us no favours.

* **Bartley**: I'm hoping we've got options to recall this season, because he's a capable player who we could do with having if any of Chico, Williams and Amat get a fairly serious knock. However, in the meantime getting him out there for some first-team football is a great decision.

**GENERAL THOUGHTS**

We've made some big signings in, but more importantly we've lost not a single key player, something I didn't think was possible.

I never really expected Michu to leave, but had already accepted the departure of Williams - for him to stay is massive, because I really think he is close to being the most important man on the pitch for us. Captain of club and country, strong, good on the ball, good in the air, and the cause of unity in our back line (while both very good defenders with Williams, Chico and Amat seem a bit confused together, which could be seen away at Ploiesti with some bad defensive positioning from both).

We are undoubtedly a stronger team than last year. Europe will be a strain on our overall form, so I don't *expect* an equal or better league finish this year, but I think we're capable of getting out of our Europa League group while avoiding a relegation scrap. After all, we managed all the League Cup games last year, right?",0,1378223085,null,0,1378240882,0,cc0wtbh,t3_1lnb4x,t1_cc0wtbh,t3_1lnb4x,null,1429604545,4,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,4

Ozil said himself that Wenger gave him complete confidence that he'd be used perfectly. Bayern has Kroos and Gotze, they don't need Ozil. PSG? He probably didn't want to go to Ligue 1. It's a big coup, way bigger than any of your transfers. I'm sorry you can't see that.

That depth barely dragged us through last season? Huh? We had the best defense in the league the 2nd half of last season, and the 2nd best defense overall. 

Sacrifice some lambs so we don't get any real injuries? We already have Poldi and Ox out until Christmas, and Vermaelen has been out for months.

Also, Jenkinson just started against Spurs and we watched Chadli do a whole lot of nothing on the left with Jenks guarding him while the defense kept a clean sheet

And Sagna is the 4th CB, so...again I don't know what you're saying here.

Actually reading through your entire post you're either trolling or just a complete moron. Wilshere not quality enough for any team wanting to go places hahahaha. He's better than 90% of your squad. Hell he's better than any of your overrated midfielders. Someone was trying to tell me Dembele was world class, why'd he look so shitty on Sunday? He was fucking horrible, as was Soldado.

Does Townsend know he's allowed to pass?

Someone's mad they spent 100m and still have a worse squad than us.

Luckily had a bottle of water so topped the radiator up and took it to a garage, take a few days for spares but I need the car badly, so I get some tube and clip it back back on, top up water and it runs fine for about 3 months.

Put it in for it's MOT, get call two hours later ""sorry mate, your head gasket blew while we ran the emissions test""

Got price of £850 from several garages to fix, one put it back on ramp to check it all out then waived the cost as it was plainly costing more to fix than the car was worth!!

these days I keep a carful eye on my new motor and it goes into garage twice a year (MOT and service, then the annual service cos the car alarms out if you try to keep driving once it passes its service date)

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"&gt;now I'll admit knowing sweet fuck all about growing weed, what I know a big chunk about is genetics and biology, and you apparently don't know yours.

I'll admit I don't have a background in genetics and biology but I do know a bit, and what I know seems to be at complete odds to what you are saying. Fuck rhino's I'm talking about plants.

You seem to be suggesting that we can introduce new traits into a plant by breeding. I'm saying those traits must already exist which they can select for to stabilize that trait and they can breed with other plants to combine various traits. Eg. picking a super strong but low yield plant with a high yielding plant to hopefully create a high yielding high strength plant. Because ultimately we only have what is already available to us, we can mix the colours but we cannot create new ones.

I know that corn yields for example have improved massively from the wild plants over hundreds of years of breeding, but there will be a wild corn plant somewhere which yielded just as good, for they will have selected that at some point during the process, and they keep selecting for bigger corns and after many hundreds of generations you end up with a larger corn.

When you put it into the context of weed and understand the reliance of clones, well people could find those special plants and simply clone them. No need to select and breed for stabilized seed. You just keep cloning.... and as I have said there are a number of well known clones which to this day are being kept for over 30 years.

So the whole idea that this breeding has resulted in a new super strong varieties, it's bullshit. And that's before you consider the fact that cannabis has been cultivated way before the 70s. It was being cultivated in the 1800's for hashish and many of these strains were picked up by breeders in the 70's.

Many people consider in fact that these new indoor varieties are not as strong as their landrace counterparts. Usually selecting for fast flowering, high yielding and short growing plants for indoor growing. I know that I have smoked some stuff from Nepal that blew my head off, more than anything I have had in Amsterdam for example.

So I don't believe it, and I think anyone who thinks that todays weed is stronger than the 70s really doesn't have a clue what they are talking about. All that has changed is peoples preferences have been refined. No longer do they want to smoke ""bush weed"", now they want high quality flowers. And consider that the hash of the 80s was just as strong then, being a concentrated product. Hash was the best you could get back then.",0,1378224743,null,0,false,0,cc0xd8i,t3_1lkeut,t1_cc0xd8i,t1_cc0vzy4,null,1429604287,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Obviously many of the players can play in various positions. At LB for example we have Agger, Sakho and Johnson who could realistically slot in behind Enrique and Cissokho. 

Midfield could still use one or two signings. I actually prefer Henderson in Gerrard's position instead of the number 10 role so backup for Coutinho would be nice in January. Ilori can apparently play as a DM with both him and Allen that position isn't too weak.

From Forbes:
Selling at a high, some say overvalued, price allowed Tottenham to only spend a net sum of £3.27M (€3.86M/$5.09M) even though they bought seven players this summer.  Tottenham arguably made an upgrade via a the-sum-is-greater-than-an-individual basis, and Real Madrid got the goal scorer and marketing force they wanted.  It’s a win-win for both clubs, and that’s what matters in the transfer market. Business success is far more important than pride.

Far enough that there should be a system to protect the tenant, and by all means fine landlords who break the rules.

This law is a bit of a red herring anyway. It just means that the money is still available if the landlord goes bankrupt.

I was actually screaming for Raheem to give Alberto the ball, he was about 25 yards out and had no one in front of him like Raheem did. I'm not trying to take away from Sterling, the shot was good and obviously the corner wasted those final few seconds we needed to deal with, but if Alberto had received that ball, we *may* be talking about him a lot more seriously had he been given the opportunity to test De Gea, or he'd even scored.",0,1378226895,null,0,false,0,cc0y4bf,t3_1lnfm3,t1_cc0y4bf,t3_1lnfm3,null,1429603865,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

The point is that he *thinks* he is, and leaves a swath of destruction in his wake because of his obliviousness to his own flaws.  There is a lot of dramatic irony in 10, which is perhaps most obvious during his time with Martha. His complete inability to see himself for who he is contrasts so well with her initial love/devotion to him which gradually decays into complete disillusionment.

As much as I love Matt Smith, the problem with 11's ""Madman with a Box"" is that the only thing 11 has consistently been is, literally, a madman with a box.

People are arguing that because we had a ""special relationship"" with Real that they shouldn't have sold to you.  Which in my mind is a ridiculous thing to ask. 

I am not happy that you got Ozil, but i had no expectation that Real wouldn't sell to you.  I was more surprised that you opened the piggybank than anything else.

In the end we can't worry about your business, we can only worry about our business, which was fantastic and widely considered one of if not the best of the entire window and our performance on the field. Its hard to separate that but it is really how the team needs to look at things as well.

Unfortunately they're usually the loud-mouthed keyboard warriors that you encounter in /r/soccer and spew Piers Morgan tweets as if they're at all intelligent.

As for depth, we have a weird situation.  We have a LOT of midfield players who can play multiple positions, and I see Özil as the keystone of our attack, with players like Cazorla, Walcott, Podolski, Rosicky, Ramsey, and Wilshere slotting in around him where needed, including striker.  If Giroud goes out today, Walcott goes up front and Rosicky starts on RW.  Later we'll have Ox for RW or Podolski up front, but that's much later unfortunately.  It's also worth noting that Walcott's contract stipulates time at striker for him, so we technically have 2 starters for striker (although he is by no means a ""true striker"" and can be utterly useless against a strong, well positioned defense)",0,1378228709,null,0,false,0,cc0ys1h,t3_1llobc,t1_cc0ys1h,t1_cc0ia23,null,1429603557,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

For one, defensive midfield is the practically the only weakness in the squad after deadline day. I look back on Momo's time at Anfield fondly (maybe because it occurred around the peak of Rafa's time here), and the circumstances absolutely allow for his return -- it's a free transfer, and I doubt his wages would be much of an impediment. He's not terrible with the ball at his feet, and more than makes up for whatever he lacks in that department with his tenacity in winning the ball. 

Besides, it's not like we'd be asking him to start regularly. If Lucas ever takes a knock or can't play for whatever reason, or if we're trying to protect a lead away from home, who would you have out there as your defensive anchor: Momo, or Joe Allen? Not knocking Joe Allen, but he's not a natural holding midfielder.

If Sturridge needs to get subbed out, Suarez will be put up front with either Moses/Sterling on the left flank and Ibe/Aspas on the right flanks. What's great about these 4 players is that they can interchange positions and be used as wingers/reverse wingers(breaking down player marking). Suarez and Aspas seem to have the same tireless workrate and are going to be a menace on those wings, opening up Coutinho in the middle to slice through the opposition defense.

Regardless of which player is going to slot into what position, we have amazing depth this season which we were severely lacking since the departure of Alonso and Mascherano.

Chelsea - Imo, the best squad in the prem now. A little weak up front (as in strikers - Torres &amp; Ba who are...*okay*), but aside from that, they kept Mata so their midfield is incredible. Their defence is pretty solid (except Terry. Fuck Terry) and they have Cech and Courtois (if they need to recall him). Also Mourinho is a world class manager. They've played well so far. I see them winning.

City - Again, world class squad, great few signings (Navas &amp; Negredo particularly). One weak area is GK - Joe Hart has been akin to Reina. No competition thus slipping in form. But I'm sure he'll want to up his game for the WC. They've played well (bar Cardiff) and I think it will be a good season for them.

Liverpool - Incredible transfer window. Ok so we didn't splash £30M+ on a striker/midfielder, but fuck it. We don't need to. We have Suarez (easily rated at £50M+), Sturridge in immense form, Coutinho (although been slightly disappointed so far, I can still see him being key for us), and Moses for the season. Toure by far the best value-for-money signings regardless of what people say about Ozil. Mignolet just behind (what a steal!). We've been pretty damn good at winning so far - even though we've been frighteningly poor at times. I can see us reaching even 2nd with a bit of luck and City collapsing more like they did against Cardiff. 

United - Poor against us. No real ""good"" signings. Fellaini will be a flop and looked like a massive panic buy by Moyes. Sure he wanted to bring in a player from Everton - fair enough - but there's no need for Fellaini and he doesn't suit the Man U style of football. Unless Man U are going to go to anti-football with long balls over the top almost stoke-esque. They've been ok but Moyes will crack under pressure. 4th is generous.

Tottenham - Great transfer window but they've lost the man who made their season last time. Without him a lot of their goals are gone. Even with Soldado &amp; Fernandinho. Their creativity came slolely from Bale last season. The chemistry he had with the rest of the team is not there with Soldado &amp; Fernandinho and it's quite clear. 3 games in - *no goals from open play*. They've been mediocre at best. Really unimpressive for a team that spent £110M. I can see them gelling around January and making a last-gasp attempt at 3rd/4th but they may well be out of it by then.

Arsenal - One marquee signing in the position they're strongest in will make very little difference. Wenger just added depth to a position they were already deep in. Admittedly their midfield is very strong now (Cazorla, Wilshere &amp; Ozil presumably) but their attack, defence &amp; GK are still gaping in terms of depth. With only Giroud as an out-and-out attacker, and Szcesny as a quality GK, you've got to question how wise dropping £42.5M on a player in your strongest position really is. Yes he will make them stronger. No, I don't think it will make them much more of a threat overall.

Everton - Just lost their best playmaker. Silly move by Martinez (although tbf Fellaini did request a transfer at the last minute). Only Baines is a quality player now. Rest of the team are pretty average. Would be very surprised if they finished higher than 7th. Could even fall into 8th/9th/10th behind teams such as Swansea or Villa. 

That's just my opinion. Far too much hype has been placed on Ozil. He's very good, yes. But he's not the saviour all the gooners think he is. ",0,1378230313,null,0,false,0,cc0zdhz,t3_1ln49b,t1_cc0zdhz,t3_1ln49b,null,1429603279,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,lbspredh,null,null,"&gt;Fuck rhino's I'm talking about plants.

I think this says it all, you know what plants and animals have in common? DNA

&gt;You seem to be suggesting that we can introduce new traits into a plant by breeding. I'm saying those traits must already exist which they can select for to stabilize that trait and they can breed with other plants to combine various traits.

this is exactly what I'm suggesting because it is true, if your logic was followed life would never have progressed from simple single celled organisms. I dont know how much detail I'm going to need to explain genetics for this to make sense to you. but I'll try anyhow

1. every time a plant grows the cells in the plant split and multiply before growing again, this does for the most part produce cells with the exact same DNA, however there are always errors when this occurs, the proteins that make up DNA are set in a sequence that determines how the cell is going to turn out, some of these are different every time so every time the cell is slightly different

2. there are segments of DNA called alleles that can identify certain attributes the plant will have, I'm guessing from your argument this is what you refer to when you say we can mix colors but make new ones, however the protein sequences on the alleles are ever so slightly changed during each cell division.

3. therefore any two cells on the same plant will almost certainly have different DNA, now for every division the effect would be minimal, but go from one end of the plant to the other, and into a new plant you will notice differences in the DNA, by this random mutation occuring all of the time it is common that an entirely new allele can be created eventually, if you select the mutant plant or plant part where this occurs and use it to create a new plant you have created a plant with an entirely different attribute. 

so yes, I am saying a new attribute can be created because this happens pretty much every time a cell divides

from this proven, factual science I can say it is more likely that corn yields will have increased through selective breeding since the chances of all the world's corn coming from a single parent plant are incalculably long odds, and I am certain that the corn plants of today are bigger than any corn plant at the birth of agriculture

when I put this into the context of clones, there is literally no reason why it should be any less possible to produce a stronger plant by selecting clones

so this whole idea that we are smoking genetically identical plants to those in the 70s is frankly ludicrous, and the length of time weed has been cultivated is irrelevant to this discussion

believe what you want, just know there is no scientific evidence to support that belief, and I know for a fact you don't know what you're talking about because your idea of how genetics works doesn't match the real world evidence.

whether this is actually what has happened I can accept a debate on, I mean perhaps we have just been selecting our plants at random in this last 200 years, I doubt it but it's not impossible.

however saying that the science is wrong here and that selective breeding cannot make stronger plants is just plain ignorant.

&gt;I'm really disappointed with his departure. It looked as though we were building a squad that was more than capable of pushing for promotion, and then we go and lose a key piece. For me, it raises a couple of concerns. Firstly, the failure to bring in a replacement means we're going to have to rely on the loan market. I'm not convinced the likes of Gillett and Moussi are of the quality necessary for us to avoid loan players. Secondly, what does this mean for Abdoun? Adlene was apparently instrumental in convincing him to join. Hopefully he can settle and become a key member of the squad.


&gt;With all of this said, however, it would be no use trying to keep a hold of him if he wanted to leave. We got a reasonable fee and it avoids having a player potentially disrupting morale. I guess we should have seen this coming from the start, considering this is his 9th club in 9 years.
