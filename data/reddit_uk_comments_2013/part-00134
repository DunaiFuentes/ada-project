You were clearly implying that rewards should come to those who are citizens, and therefore 'deserving'.  If all that is required to become a citizen is that one form is filled over another, it's a pretty poor judge as to whom should receive healthcare that they already pay for.

&gt;Did I say immigrants are the root cause? You're filling your own bias and agenda in and deviating from my words.

You said ""how awful the NHS has become suggests you've had no dealing with it of recent to see just how shit it is"" in reply to me referencing immigrants and whether they should pay.  That's been the subject of the comments, and story throughout.  Are you saying that you've had something else at the back of your mind as to why you said the NHS is shit?

Of course this is ""legitimate"" tobacco that's just a little out of it's region, not a black market grow and processing operation. You're quite right that that sort of tobacco is a small percentage of the trade.

You can't see her patterns of behaviour, because she regularly deletes her comments once they're a day or two old, but she is known for ignoring reasonable responses and insulting people.

I.E. she'll claim X, a responder will address the issue of X, and she'll reply ""haha, good try, for reason Y"", completely ignoring how she's wrong about X and been proven so.

He told me this years ago but I'll do my best:

He'd been helping a mate recondition a car and had various bits, including the rear registration plate, in the yard/kitchen.

The car got stolen during the work and he called the police.

They arrived, saw the registration plate on the kitchen table and immediately decided he was falsely reporting it stolen for an insurance claim or similar: arrested on the spot.

They basically treated him like shit and refused to believe anything he said and when he asked for a Solicitor they first refused.
Then they threw a full-size phone book at him and said ""dial one"".
There was more along these lines but the they got really dirty at the end when they were ""releasing"" him:

""We've decided to let you go, there's just a bit of paperwork to quickly sign"". He read the document he was being asked to sign and it was of course a full confession that they had prepared for him in the hopes he either could not read or did not bother to read.

He of course refused whereupon they bodily picked him up, carried him back to a cell and threw him in full-force.

He still despises the police and won't ever speak to them or help them.

So that would be 2, by virtually every account AVB/Levy wanted to bring in 2 strikers while potentially keeping either JD or Ade as the 3rd and then upgrading a youth striker.  So if we ship out BOTH JD and Ade, well....who are the other strikers that are coming in?

I'm much more curious about the CB position at this point.  We seem to be really close to Ilori now but after how poor Skrtel was last season and how uncomfortable he seems to be in BR's system, is it reasonable to rely on him?  I mean even if Toure was brought in to start this season, he's not a long term solution and that idea goes against the grain of what our philosophy seems to be.  I don't think Ilori or Coates are good enough to be starting alongside Agger every weekend and I'm skeptical of Skrtel's ability to adapt (which is a shame because I love him and really want him to succeed here).

Although 3-5-2's and other extreme formations are different

It is the actual instructions and player responsibilities which determine the effectiveness. Manchester United played a consistent formation against us, but realised we were weak on one side and changed the instructions of their build up play to roger Cole

That being said, the formation is too narrow. It crowds out the midfield but we are not a possession based team, and don't have the players currently who could achieve that.

Also my mum was a police typist in the 70s in a large and rough Scottish town. She typed out statements, apparently a lot of the people arrested were very accident prone, always walking into doors and falling down stairs.

My own experience has been mostly fine, though they can be a bit arsey when they want to be. I consider myself lucky though as on more than one occasion I've had a policeman give me arsey treatment then not search me, which was a relief considering what I had in my pockets.

______________
______________
______________ 
  
  So i'm going to give you a quick lesson on why many Somalis are *actually* unemployed in the UK.  ______________
______________
______________ 
  We have a lot of pride and alot of problems within the UK, and many choose to beleive this is because of Khat (which makes people lazy and not want to work) instead of cultural dissonance.  
______________
______________
______________ 
Most Somali's in the UK aren't lazy because of Khat; it's because they're ex-Upper class Somali Civil Service. In the early 90's most of my uncles were on incredible salaries doing f*** all in Somaliland. When they came over here, they all expected to be handed white-collar middle management jobs on a plate. However, in the UK you need *real* qualifications to be able to do white collar jobs (my dad was lucky as he was a qualified doctor upon entry), and most to this day outright refuse to work as a cashier in Sainsburys or similar ""inferior"" jobs. Instead they prefer to parade around in suits unemployed for a decade watching 24 hour Somali news channels, still waiting for that magical call from the Somali embassy saying their expertise are desperately needed.  
______________
______________
______________      
So you end up with a situation where most of these Somali men are out of work, whilst their wife's are working to bring in the income. Most other British think they're lazy; these groups are just utterly, utterly delusional.  
______________
______________
______________ 
The solution to this isn't to ban Khat, it's to bring Somali-born Male expectations down a notch. Unfortunately the Anti-Khat movement is propped up by conservative middle-class Somali's, who would rather believe that the problem is caused by the presence of drugs and alcohol.  
____________
Edit: Just to be clear there are alot of generalisations in here that many Somalis may find offensive. I don't claim to have the whole picture; both of My parents are doctors who came over to London in 1992, unlike many Somali's I have had quite a good UK upbringing why I (perhaps incorrectly) beleive gives me quite a good insight into some British Somali Communities. Please bear in mind I am only 20 years old.

As for why, despite Skrtel having a poor season, he is still much better than Toure. He lacks leadership and foresight but makes up for it in strength and tackling. He isn't great at Rodgers system of not having the centrebacks attack the strikers (like under KK). He doesnt seem to be able to plan ahead or position himself correctly at times. His passing is okay, he could cope in a retention of possession system but I'm sure he'd rather lump it up field. We would be better of replacing Skrtel with a more adept CB,but if that isn't the case then he'll surely start.

I'd much rather ministers were a bit more honest that there's really not much in the way of public health argument involved in the banning of lots of drugs, and that basically the argument for banning seems to come from some kind of arbitrary moral belief that people should only be able to take certain mind altering chemicals, but not others.

Not by a long shot. As a landlord, once you take on a tenant you basically lose all rights to the property but get to pay all the bills and if your tenant never pays, you get to spend £1000s and wait months if not a year or more going through the whole legal process to get your property back.

Here's the solution for cannabis and the potential mental health issues:

**Education**.

Don't use it if your family has history for mental health problems.  Don't abuse it.  Feeling unwell while using it, please see a Doctor and seek help.

There's also the part of legalisation while many people won't know since they don't know a great deal about cannabis.  If it was legal, it wouldn't all be this strong high THC skunk we have on the street at the moment. Strains with high levels and ratio of THC over other cannaboids such as [CBD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol) are linked to mental health issues over ones which has less THC and a much closer ratio of the two.

There could be as much diversity as alcohol.  Rather than high THC all the time, there'd be strains with other properties which are known to reduce anxiety etc.

Also I'm not a huge European history buff (I only know what happened in the US) but were darker skinned people as repressed there as they were here in the US? 

There have been times when he was seen as Human or foreign and not accepted, but his charisma, wit and confidence often (eventually) made the people repressing him realize their mistake.

They charged my £60 then took months to do.. nothing. I kept phoning them - they claimed they need to do ALL reference and credit checks all over again as it was a legal requirement. The landlady (!!) intervened and told them to forego that, she was happy with me as a tenant, no bother. When they kept dragging their heels she terminated their service agreement - she'd been peed off with them for quite a while anyway and is now dealing with me directly. 

Countrywide kept sending me letters for months reminding me that rent was due and they'd hit me with penalty charges.. they didn't update their records and still had landlady as client. She had to intervene again. It was shambolic as feck.

I claimed back all fees last year when [Shelter ran their campaign in Scotland](http://www.reclaimyourfees.com) - in fairness, Countrywide were quick to reimburse; Slater Hogg shrugged their shoulders until I took them to the Small claims Court (and then they paid up fast).

So you might be unlucky and have to pay up - unless you can deal with your landlord directly (look into it, if you are on good terms I'd definitely recommend it). If you're in Scotland you can claim back your fees. Hopefully the rest of the UK will follow suit soon.

I like yours and Flobblem's reasoned opinions, I agree with both of you. I initially found it strange, given there are pretty much the same rights and privileges afforded by civil partnerships and marriages, that anyone was bothered by the way things are. I thought people were just getting hung up on the semantics of ""marriage"".

However, the way I see it now is that the main problem is that ""religious institutions are not legally permitted to perform civil partnerships""^[1] and that is ridiculous. If a religious same-sex couple wish to have their legal union blessed by a religious institution which is willing to do so, there should be no state law restricting their rights (the couple's or the institution's) to do so.
I can't understand why 175 elected MPs failed to look at it this way. It is a massive restriction on freedom of religious expression.

&gt;Why not overhaul all 'partnership' legislation so's no-one can get 'married' on the state, only civil partnered then allow all the churches of all the different shades to offer the marriage.

That sounds like a great idea to me.

true,Stormwatch36,cyberman,Cyberperson,"TL;DR: If someone doesn't like the direction Moffat is taking the show, they hate change?

You have good points here, but the direction you're taking them in is unnecessary. I don't think Moffat did a good job in season 5, 6, or 7A. I think he pulled his head out of his ass and started doing a great job when 7B rolled around. That doesn't mean that I hate change and would rather Smith degenerate back into Tennant because I'm some kind of RTD fanboy. I just didn't like what Moffat was doing, plain and simple. I understand the show is about change, but there are good changes and bad changes. 

Having the Eighth Doctor reveal that he was half human is widely considered a bad move. The show, audios, and novels have spent ages trying to retcon that because it was an extremely stupid and unnecessary plot point.

He identifies this fact but you try to use it against him as if you are proving him wrong, despite its inclusion already
All other points he made you conveniently ignore.

In the overall debate, you also are trying to use the claim that Moonshiners exist as a way of saying legalised alcohol hasn't changed anything. When I am pretty sure (without numbers) from personal experience that most people do not consume moonshine or non regulated alcohol. It is a tiny minority in the huge majority. Regulated Cigarettes are consumed worldwide and its hardly heard of (especially in the west) of unregulated ones being consumed.

In this case all patterns go against what you claim. A good portion of organised crime is caused by the money in illegal drugs and narcotics, not by Alcohol and Cigarettes. 
It is not Utopian to look at patterns, past experiences and examples as a way of creating a model for how that type of thing would happen again in the future, it is an completely accepted academic way of approaching future events.

Assuming a tariff of 14p per kilowatt hour:

£70,000,000/0.14 = 500,000,000

Assuming two months vegetating (20 hours on), two months flowering (12 hours on), using 60W per plant:

(60*(30*2*20)+60*(30*2*12))/1000 = 115.2 kw/h per plant

500,000,000/115.2 = 4,340,278 plants

Assuming 5 ounces per plant, that's 21,701,388oz that could be produced for £70m worth of electricity (if it was spent on lighting alone). Sell those for £150 each, and the return would be about £3.2b.

Of course the £70m isn't just spent on lighting, it's spent on ventilation, possibly hydroponics, and most likely the rest of the damn house, but still, that's a lot of revenue that could be taxed.

Over the last few decades, it has been presented on TV, or movies, or soaps that being gay is OK (and rightly so), and that a lot of people who are gay are just normal people. Also, a lot of people know someone who is gay, and they don't dislike them, so people don't mind gay people and therefore aren't opposed to them getting more rights. 

People who take drugs, on the other hand, are represented completely differently. We'll often see story lines on soaps where someone gets hooked on 'drugs' (often something hard like cocaine, not marijuana, but they'll still refer to it as being on drugs), and their life will go downhill. We also have a government who are vehemently anti-drugs. This means that when someone says they want to legalise certain drugs, they'll imagine they mean the bad ones like shown on TV, and will be against it.

Perhaps we'll see a change in the future, but I doubt it.",0,1372863547,null,0,false,0,cav78bx,t3_1hk3uw,t1_cav78bx,t1_cav6l56,null,1430596781,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,hereIam__,null,null,"Well I look down here and it is mostly nice storys

But here are a few of mine, 29 male, never been directly in trouble no record, generally a good white boy. 

However the following have completely tainted my view of the police

1) I was once followed on a saturday morning as i was driving over to my dads house. It was about 15 minutes away from mine, via town, lots of stopping traffic. When all of a sudden the police lights come on. OK i am being pulled over. I do everything he asks, I ask him what hte problem was, no answer, he then starts walking around my car, and it was plain he was trying to find something on me. After 20 minutes of questions, him poking at my car, I was let off with a ""warning"" yet i am not really sure what for ""wasting police time?""

2) I have 3 friends that joined the police force, one thing they all have in commmon? all were bullied pretty badly at school. Police friend 1) first chance he got, put my familys names in to the computer and a few weeks later informs me that my dad and uncle have very colourful pasts (wtf) and when questionning him about it, appeartly he checked a shit loads of peoples records because he could. So now some common friends are aware of my dads criminal past. Highly illegal but who the fuck you going to tell. A different friend, once was at the pub, with one of their police friends. I can honestly say I have never met such a power hungry self righteous idiot. This girl sat their boasting about how she can fuck people up who caused her issues even raging about how if she ever meets her ""enemies from school"" she would destory their lifes, it is so hard to explain but when you at the pub and you see this from someone that is meant to protect and serve, you start to see who really is attracted to police work

3) Police heavy handiness, I live in a fairly busy town, we have a night life. so some of the things i seen

-- A man once in a swimming pool sweared at some kids who spalshed him. He was told to get out the pool he said no that the place was over reacting. 15 minutes later 8 police officers turned up, and 4 jumped in the swimming pool to haul him out. Now if it was not so sad that 8 police were using their time for this it would have been some funny. 4 wet policepeople trying to get a guy out of a swimming pool while 4 watched. amazing. (have video someone!) 
-- Night life is pretty good, now ever this is a bit more understandable but still over the top. Drunk man walking down street that is closed off (no cars still allowed to walk) the police tell him to get on the pavement (really no reason to) he says no, shouting. The police see this as defiance 4 grab him and slam him in to the group restricting his arms so his head hits the floor. I heard the crack. Now yes the guy was benig loud but there was no reason for him to walk on the pavement, and their was no reason to cause that much damage to him. 3 minutes after pinning him to the floor (and by now he was fighting and personally i understand why) 2 police cars turn up 6-8 more police jump out. Again amazing. I caught that on video as well, building up a few videos.

All in all, as a 29 year old, I do not trust the police, nore will i go to them for help. They have even stopped helpping local shops saying that if someone has stolen something less than 100 pounds they will not investigate. 

 and lets not even get started on the whole twitter thing, wasting police time on words? words are wind and mean nothing they cannot hurt you. Yet in the uK they can send you to prision for having an option.

________________
If you read my above reply to twogunssalute you'll see I completely agree with you; I'm not speaking for all Somalis, namely my extended family and friends on my fathers side who came over in the period 1992-1999. This probably comprises about 500+ people. And (though I didn't use the word early), because they're unemployed many are effectively useless for the economy, even though it's not through wanting to exploit benefits payments as the Tabloids may have you beleive. 

I even said that I'm only referring to those who are persistantly unemployed and explaining it's not because they're lazy but because they're delusional and unqualified for white-collar jobs. After a decade of trying to help them, my father's frustration finally gave in against their wall of arrogance.

Sure feels sandy.  Mata is one of the best on the team for controlling possession so that actually undermines your position.  He also plays on the Spanish national team which controls possession and while it doubtful Barcelona actually wants Mata, there are reasons his name is floated out there including the theory he would fit into the tiki-taka.

true,mfanning1990,ZW,zimbabwe,"&gt; It could work on the counter attack, but Mata is not fast enough

Fast. Not Nippy, not agile, not anything else. I'm talking about pure straight line speed. 

How does it undermine my position, I was referring to counter attacking when I mentioned his pace. FM says 17, I sure as hell don't agree with that; I have watched him train, he is not faster than Ramires or Hazard in a straight line, even Ronaldo or Messi are both faster on and off the ball and they are roughly the same speed as him on FM. I've see him week in week out get skinned by faster more physical players in a 50-50, yet FM posts that number. Have you seen the FM data collection process? They have no access to data from the clubs such as sprint times and weight training data.

Ok, so if you are the expert, please tell my having pace would be a standard requirement for possession football, such as ""Tiki-Taka"", Tiki-Taka is defined as an expert one touch football. If you watch Mata, his main area of play is either picking up the ball and distributing on the edge of the box, after getting into space, or playing off someone else in the centre. Hell even most of his goals come from inside or the edge of the box when we have had a long periods of possession and build up. Close control, an eye for space, great technique. Not pace. There is a reason he was brought in from the wing. He also slows down play and has been told to do so. 

Sure you must know the difference between quick and fast as well, something you did not touch upon whilst you attempted to say my argument was built on sand. Poorly structured in terms or wording yes, but my point remains and I certainly know what I am talking about, otherwise I shall have to tell my old boss I didn't learn a thing and that I  will have to stop working for him in the future once I finish in London.

Edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44Yt_wKCSVw  

For the majority, he gets closed down extremely quickly in a straight line and sheds his speed dramatically with a change in direction, but in that moment a counter attacking opportunity can be lost extremely quickly when players are rushing back... all it takes is two seconds and a chance is gone.",0,1372865907,null,0,1372866484,0,cav81yp,t3_1hkbfn,t1_cav81yp,t1_cav7mr6,null,1430596381,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

You have to be seen as being in permanent residence. They call it 'Qualifying Residence'

&gt; The NHS is a residency based system, free at the point of delivery. The legal framework that underpins our current charging system defines what is meant by ‘residency’, and then determines which other groups of people who are not ‘residents’ should or should not be charged. 

The proposal is:

&gt; To adopt a revised definition of qualifying residency for free NHS entitlement that requires a non-European Economic Area (EEA) migrant (who is subject to immigration control) to have indefinite leave to remain (ILR) before they can acquire the status of ordinary residence.

So if you're not a British Citizen, or coming from an EU state or don't have ILR (ndefinite leave to remain - typically what spouses of UK citizens hold until they get a passport), then you will be subject to paying the charges.

Also anyone leaving the UK and then wanting to return, they won't get healthcare unless they have paid a full 7 years of NI contributions.

I can see this hitting the Universities very hard.

tl;dw, police shoot people walking and running away. Sexually harass a woman then arrest her, beat people to death who are unconscious. Beat people to death who are mentally ill.

They've been beating up black people for years but it wasn't until [people started filming it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW1ZDIXiuS4) and [white people](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVR4wTPsHYk) started getting beaten up that anyone started giving a shit. Too bad the police are so corrupt that the officers never get in trouble. Maybe paid leave for a bit if they're unlucky....

barely any, because if you keep someone doing what they dont want to do, they dont give a fuck about it, but if you employ someone who WANTS to be doing that, that person is going to do a much better job at growing the plants, and end up with more, and better product. And because there is a real market for it there, there is competition, so you want the best bud you can grow.

Khat is a ~~nice~~ niche stimulant and IMO the result of this will only be to make it less available and drive the Ethiopian-Somali youth to beer and weed.

I was really enraged when I saw this in my local paper a year or two ago, and wanted to write multipage letters for them explaining how idiotic it would be to ban khat.

The people around Bradford and mostly very friendly and it is pretty safe (I never really feel in danger but I'm 6ft 4 so that may come into it). The [town centre](http://www.impressions-gallery.com/_lib/_user_files/Image/Impressions%20General/Bradford_City_-_Centenary_Square_-_June_2006_rt.jpg) around centenary square is very nice and has recently been redone to include a [pool](http://www.impressions-gallery.com/_lib/_user_files/Image/Impressions%20General/City%20park%20night%20thumb.jpg). Some of the buildings in the city centre and outside towards Saltaire (I'll talk about that later) are very nice such as [Waterstones](http://community.dur.ac.uk/paul.hodgkinson/wordpress/wp-content/photos/BradfordWaterstones.jpg). The majority of the Architecture itself in the city centre is really nice with very old buildings scattered around which really give it a sense of history you don't get with other cities.

A VERY nice area is Saltaire. It is quite a bit away from the city centre but is a fantastic place. Classed as a world heritage site, it is a really nice quaint village with the old [mill](http://www.icecreambarge.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Saltaire-Canal-Winter.jpg) as a focus. It also has brilliant pubs/bars like [Fanny's Ale House](http://bradford-pubs.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2012-05-27_1338135081.jpg), [the Boathouse](http://www.theboathouseinn.co.uk/images/tbhim.jpg) which runs around the canal and [The Old Tramshed](http://s0.geograph.org.uk/photos/42/04/420431_59be2803.jpg). This is where I would suggest at least coming to visit. 

Bradford is also known for it's ridiculously good curry restaurants. Shimla Spice, Aggrah, Kebabish, Ackbar's, Mumtaz: they are all fantastic and I would recommend them all. Real ale is also drunk quite often but that is a general thing in the North of England really. There are several brewaries around so there is always some good beer going.

For nice areas to live in, I would suggest Shipley, Idle/Thackley (where I live) or Saltaire. They all have pretty good connections to the city centre, are very safe and good areas in general.

You care about the people affected by the illegal side? how about the thousands of people that get put in a cage for doing something in the privacy of their own home, doing no harm to anybody else? you don't care about them?

Keeping a lot of drugs illegal and criminalised is like shooting yourself in the foot, and blaming the gun for the wound.

You say we cannot compare it too alcohol, but we can. In the states when it was illegal, it was treated just like any other illegal drug, people got killed over the production and sale of it, and sure as hell people where forced to do things they didnt want to do relating to that market.

I think if they had a 3-man central midfield behind them then the 2 under the ST have complete freedom to roam the entire attacking third with no defensive responsibilities.

Having someone in that Makelele role could also provide the two advanced CMs with more freedom to make forward runs and runs out to the wing (think De Bruyne would excel in that regard.)

I don't think it would take too much if anything away from the attack while adding some defensive stability.

For example, I loved her in Smith and Jones, the Family of Blood episodes, the season 3 finale (although I have problems with that finale itself but not her performance) and in her appearances after season 3. In those episodes she was allowed to be her own person, and she had a really strong, cool personality. In a lot of the other episodes in season 3, her defining characteristic was that she was quietly pining over the doctor. For me, that's just not interesting to watch and, frankly, having unrequited love as the defining aspect is going to make almost any character look at least a little pathetic. 

I loved her first episode because she was smart and capable. I really liked her in Family of Blood because she was on her own for a lot of it and I feel like we got to see more of her character and how resourceful she could be. Most of all, [I loved her exit because](#s ""she was the only companion in New Who to leave on her own terms."") I also really liked the moments in her season when she would call the doctor out on stuff.

In her appearances after season 3 (when she's gotten over her crush) I think she's a pretty cool character because she took her time with the doctor to make a new life for herself and do her part to protect the world. 

**TL;DR: I just wish that the writers hadn't made her unrequited love for the doctor *the* central aspect of her character or at least made it a little more subtle because she has so many other awesome attributes that get overshadowed by this.**

If we play the Christmas tree, I agree, it would provide Mata with a central position to exploit his passing, Hazard has the freedom to shift between the left/right wings easily, Oscar/KDB/Lampard/Ramires can make runs forward, and lessen the defensive requirements of all involved (provide they track back). I was simply stating what I believed others rational was behind 4-2-3-1.

Furthermore, I think the tree would be so easy to adapt to the situation. Need more width? Sub on Schurrle or Moses. Need more attacking options? Tell Oscar/Kdb to play higher up the field. Need more defensive strength? Put on another DM or tell the CM's to sit deeper back. Depending on who we start, the formation could be changed to a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1 without any subs if needed and change the direction of the attack (added width, running through vs. passing through, etc.) and organization of the defense. Not that changing the formation really matters, but the ability to change whats expected of the players can add an element of unpredictability to how we play.

I'd say there are two fair definitions of Companion. The first is the one I subscribe to, defining a Companion as anyone who has traveled with the Doctor on more than one trip. Mickey is definitely a companion. Captain Jack is definitely a companion. I'm not sure if Canton counts since he really was only in one story. Still, being a valuable ally of the Doctor counts for something.

Another definition that I think is completely fair, is that the Companion is the co-star. In this case there is usually only one companion at a time and it's typically an attractive woman.

Couple of things: I'd look at actual Universities, or somewhere like [SAE](http://uk.sae.edu/en-gb/home/) as the chances are that they'll have a higher budget, and so better facilities, which are REALLY important for Music Tech/Production. You want a variety of different desks/softwares so that you're comfortable with any random bit of kit you get thrown. Also you'll probably get a more worthwhile degree, both in terms of recognition and what the course actually entails. 

Look at [UCAS](http://search.ucas.com/) to find unis that offer courses (to name a few Portsmouth, Southampton Solent (ahem) De Montfort, Staffordshire, Oxford Brooks...) then check their websites for more details. Also get some prospectuses sent out, it's free and helps with information about the uni/city in general, especially if you can't go to an open day.

Catherine Tate is a fine comedian, but her dramatic acting is always strongly informed by her comedic skills. Though she improves over the course of her time on the show, she tends toward stiffness and shouting when trying to be serious.

Maybe some people dislike Martha's acting and love Donna's, but I haven't met one yet. This subreddit is full of enthusiasts, so I'm not surprised by all the downvotes my advice gathered. However, someone who *quit the show* over Martha is not invested enough to slog through stories they don't like just to get to some they do.

In my opinion one of the greatest strengths of Doctor Who is that the episodes are self-contained stories whose dramatic arc, setting, characters, tone, and style vary widely. Skipping ahead to the introduction of Matt Smith would provide /u/Taigatrommel with an entirely new cast being directed by a new creative lead, and I think it might lead him/her to return to the skipped seasons eventually.

I've rented for 10 years and I've had my shitty share of landlords but with the deposit scheme there isn't much they can do to rip you off nowadays - its more likely to be letting agents with their 'fees'. To be honest the biggest problems I have had with houses has been with things like damp or something else wrong with the house, as landlords don't live there it can be hard to get them to actually see the problem. 

So my biggest advice would be to look really carefully at the house you're thinking of renting as that will save you trouble in the long run. Check for things like central heating, good windows - new if possible, ask them when they were last changed. Look for smoke alarms as that will save your life, check to see if they have an up to date gas certificate (every house should have one as this checks for carbon monoxide poisoning and it shows that the landlord actually cares about their tenants). Check for watermarks on the walls and ceilings as this is a sign of damp, and a damp house is no fun believe me, it gets all over your stuff and makes you sick, and theres not much you can do about it when its the middle of winter.Then just look at the general state of the furniture/building.

How they can stay so fucking ignorant in the face of hard evidence is beyond me, its because of politics, because of power. The leaders of today do not make choices for the benefit of us, the british public, but they make the choices they make because it benefits them. When you look at the netherlands, they have ""allowed"" cannabis to be sold freely to anyone over the age of 18, and they have a lower % of the population that regularly use it than we do. In Portugal they decriminalised ALL drugs, and 10 years later drug abuse is down by 50%. The evidence is there, Prof. David Nutt, former head of the ACMD (Advisory Council of the Misuse of Drugs) said that cannabis should be decriminalised, and MDMA is safer than horse riding, this is a guy that is educated on the topic, he knows his stuff, when he brought this up to the tories, did they listen to him? No. They gave him the sack.

Im not saying it should be lagalized because i want to smoke it. It should be lagalised because i want to be treated like a human being, i want to make my own choices in life, if i want to do what i want, providing i am causing no harm to anybody else.

It's my body, and i'm the one who dies when i die, not you, so let me do with it what i want.
If by doing so, i am causing harm to other people, then that is a different matter, but as far as drugs go, im taking them , not you. 


&gt;The black market would not disappear overnight and I think it's likely that, because of how established it is now, it's won't go quickly or quietly.

Why is it so established now? because you have allowed it to grow. The longer you leave it, the harder its going to be to try and stop it, and using that as an excuse is pathetic.

As a landlord, once you take on a tenant you basically lose all rights to the property but get to pay all the bills and if your tenant never pays, you get to spend £1000s and wait months if not a year or more going through the whole legal process to get your property back.

Well, that was not the case in my situation with 2 previous landlord, who felt it perfectly reasonable to enter my property without notice and go through MY personal belongings. You may very well be a good landlord but there are a shit load of them out there who are total cunts and as a tenant you have very little rights in a way of defend against them. I know this first handed, I even contacted CAB who told gave me very little support because there just isn't much to defend tenants in such situations.  Please note I'm an honest person and always treated my landlords and their property with utmost respect, in return I've received almost none. 

Also, regarding the bills, this is total bull shit, when the tenant leave you can send a notice to the utility companies that your tenant has left and that you accept all charges from X date onwards, you are providing a service, so take responsibility for it! Then any previous debt is purely in their name!  This recently happened to me with and SW Water, who attempted to chase me for £1200 from the date I left the property till March 2013. I didn't even live in the county, but SW Water said it was my fault due to no notification my behalf, I did and so did my estate agent notify them. VERY luckily I was able to prove they where in the wrong, due to my previous estate agent being able to back me up (first time I actually gain some respect for an estate agent TBH). You clearly seem to be quite clueless on such matter. 

&gt; No it isn't. They can issue a Section 21 notice for no reason at all from the date the AST ends. The fact you don't know this suggests you know little of the law in regards to renting.

Yes, when the eviction is **not** based on discrimination, which in this case, it was direct discrimination because I confronted the landlord regarding him and his daughter **BREAKING** the law by entering the property with zero notice multiple times.  If I would of gone to the police, this would of stretched out for many months with very long proceeding with little result, where as their power allowed them issue an eviction notice to me in a matter of hours.

I am not anti-cannabis. I'm not really pro-cannabis either though. I'm pretty neutral. I do think that people should be able to do whatever they want as long as they aren't hurting anybody.

But bitching and whining about the fact that you chose to break the law and might get in trouble is pathetic. 

Let me put it this way, it's generally recognised that 80mph is an acceptable speed on an empty motorway however the speed limit is still 70mph. If I choose to go 80mph and get a ticket because of it, that's my fault.

You have no need to use cannabis, you choose to knowing that it is illegal. You made the choice to break the law and if you are caught it's only fair that you take responsibility. My feeling on this point is unrelated to whether or not cannabis should be legalised.

1. Heard a load of fireworks going off in the park/open space next to my house so a buddy, my girlfriend and me go investigate to find a large group of teenagers about to start smashing up a quite new motorcycle and throwing fireworks around.  Me and my buddy get into a scuffle with the teens who are throwing fireworks at us and swinging metal bars while trying to trash this bike meanwhile my girlfriend phones 999. Obviously distressed woman screaming they are attacking us, please help gives location and hangs up. The teens eventually get the message and luckily no serious damage has been done but we now are sitting there with a probably stolen bike. So we wait for the police... we are now starting to worry that like The Sand People that the teens might easily frightened but will return in greater numbers but we still wait.. and wait... after about hour we just give up and go home. Girlfriend had contact with police at work so a few days later she brings it up to the officer she was dealing with, he looks into it and it shows that the call was logged as ""Woman being attacked"" then promptly closed nothing further was done.

2. Car is broken into and there is splatters of blood and some bloody fingerprints where some scrotebag has nicked our car stereo but cut themselves in the process, phone police but forensics are too busy to help absolutely insist that they take the this really obvious evidence which they refuse so we drive the whole damn crime scene over to them and refuse to leave till they do which of course they now will. Our evidence is the bit that convicts the the serial car stereo thief who they estimate has done more than 30 cars since his release from prison, The cop who speaks to the paper praises the focused police operation that has lead to the arrest and prosecution.

3. Few guys wandering back after the pub, a few beers but hardly drunk. Choice, one side of the road is a friends house the other side is a take away. One guy presses the button to use the road crossing then of course someone wants to hit the take away.

""my understanding was that unless they have a reasonable suspicious about you then you don't have to say anything."" 

You must provide your name and address if you are suspected of committing an offence (I.E going being arrested or committing a road traffic offence) you always have the right to refuse to comment on any line of questioning, although it may be harmful to do so when/if your case goes to court. Refusing to do so is one of the justified grounds for arresting someone. Basically if you refuse to give your details when an officer thinks you may have commited a crime they can arrest you to detrimine who you are. This can sometimes lead to people who think they know the law getting arrested. Such as the countless videos you see of stops where someone has commited a minor traffic offence and they refuse details. The officer is trying everything to get there name out of them so they don't have to be arrested, the SGT will turn up and it will to most people seem a massive overreaction. But they are actually merely trying to prevent having to arrest the guy.

The thing is, those statistics don't represent people buying things 'from a mate down the pub', that's shops selling products illegally to avoid taxes and people buying the cheapest thing in the shop because they can't afford to buy more expensive stuff.

I doubt most consumers are aware that what they're buying is smuggled or that the shops aren't paying taxes. They might not be too upset to find out that they're getting things cheaper because the product is illegally imported, but I doubt anyone goes around actively looking for knockoff 'vokda' and cigarettes.

What's more, most people are more than willing to pay the extra price of a regulated, taxed product because they don't want to risk their health on a product whose quality can't be guaranteed. The only people who don't choose the safer option are those who can't afford to do so.

However, even if you ignore all of those objections (which I suspect you might), the plain and simple truth is that while marijuana is illegal, ~100% of professional growers are stealing electricity and not paying income tax, ~100% of buyers aren't paying sales tax on their purchase and ~100% of the product sold is unregulated, untested and from unknown sources that could be supporting or perpetuating any number of other illegal activities. While some of these cases are inevitably because the people involved are stupid or evil, the majority will be because society offers no alternative. If marijuana were legalised, taxed and regulated those percentages would all decrease dramatically.

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"&gt; And presumably the clocks affected by this news are also unaffected by the mains wobble, and vice versa?

Almost certainly, but not inherently.

You could, in theory, build a clock that set itself to the MSF signal, but kept time between synchronisations by mains frequency.  I have no idea why anyone _would_ do that, but it's possible.

The MSF signal is susceptible to a few issues - ranging from poor radio reception, to maintenance (as per this thread).  It's also broadcast once per minute (although precise to a fraction of a second).  If you want seconds on a clock, you need to count them yourself.  This is often done with just a microcontroller counting cycles on an RC oscillator (i.e. not even a crystal), because the accuracy of that is enough that the clock never gets more than a second or so out even in the event of long gaps in pickups of the signal.

But with the cost of the radio pickup and decoding gear, a quartz oscillator is negligable, and so that's also a common set up.

Anyway, in terms of rarity - the radio set clocks will be sold on this feature - look for 'radio controlled' or 'atomic' [0].  They've been getting more common in the past few years - at £12-£15 a go, they're at the 'probably one in most houses' level.

Note that DAB, Freeview, Satellite TV, GPS and mobile phone receivers also get a time signal from those mechanisms, and thus are (or can be) auto-setting.  I can't speak to the accuracy of those, but I'd be surprised if they're more than a few seconds away from the MSF signal.

GPS is special, and is the most accurate - it _has_ to be based on atomic clocks for GPS to work (They use time difference to multiple satellites to track location).

They seem to have stopped the monthly bulitins that track the MSF signal against UTC, but it's typically within 5 microseconds.  GPS time is within about 8 nanoseconds.

A quartz clock has perfect accuracy - the moment it's set.  It's the drift that gets you - a typical cheap crystal is 20ppm, which means about ~~1 minute~~ 10 minutes per year drift.  The signal backing MSF is an atomic clock, and is about 1 part per 10 ^ 14.

[0] The MSF signal is backed by an atomic clock.  It's not an actual atomic clock - not at the price!

Even if you are a member tickets are first come first serve so you may not even get a ticket, it's essentially a lottery for popular games. If the game didn't sell out, you might be able to get a general sale ticket. 

I would suggest going to Selhurst Park, where Palace play, and trying to buy a ticket from a tout (which is illegal but people still do) but since it's their first game in the premiership in years I can't see anyone selling a ticket for less than one on stubhub.

/u/rumdiary's story might be positive in that it worked out for his brother, but think of all the other occasions when lying cops get away with it. I think your statement about ""oversight"" and them ""not getting away with it"" is, as a generalisation, radically optimistic. 

In my case, I was given a fixed penalty fine, which allowed me to avoid a criminal record so long as I paid it without objection. Perhaps I could have challenged the ticket in court, but doing so would have raised the stakes considerably - I'm not sure if public order offences (""harassment, alarm and bullshit"") are considered a criminal conviction on one's permanent record, but the fine could have gone to several hundred quid. I spoke to at least two solicitors, and was told that cops lie all the time in court and that magistrates will tend to just accept their statements unquestioningly.

It is not just the two cops who lied that bothers me. I mean, the fact that they didn't have the chance to put their heads together and agree their story suggests to me that they lie all the time. The cop to my right may have hesitated, but she knew to make a statement which would appropriately support the fixed-penalty ticket - she didn't say ""hey, that didn't happen"" and she didn't go to a senior officer and get me quietly released.

Had the booking sergeant separated those two cops and asked them to tell their stories, there is no possible way they could have supported each other. Their fictions would have proved those cops liars. When the duty inspector fulfilled his legal obligation to tell me ""hello, I'm the duty inspector"" I tried to ask him if he'd spoken to the offers himself - instead, he just walked out.

As far as I'm concerned both the booking sergeant and that inspector failed in their duty of care to me - they saw me screwed over because they couldn't be bothered to check for themselves.

&gt;Whenever criticism is levelled against the USA on Reddit, the most upvoted comments are those defending America. Just below that is a layer of people lamenting the (often nonexistent) anti-American 'circlejerk', and below that will be a smorgasbord of explanations as to why America was right all along. There's rarely any acceptance that the USA may have got something 'wrong'.

&gt;It seems like we're more ready to accept our nation's wrongdoing than our American cousins are. Is that true? Are we actually more critical of our own nation's chequered track record? What has the UK done wrong in the 20th Century and maybe even before it was the United Kingdom? What are our equivalents of Iran Air flight 655, and have we come to terms with how wrong they were?

&gt;Reddit's obviously going to sway things, but I think we largely accept the moral question marks over the Dresden bombings, 'scorched earth' in the Boer War, British troops' actions in Northern Ireland... I know the Empire tends to be viewed with a noticeable rose tint, but if somebody posted a link to the human rights abuses in Kenya I wonder how many Britons would try to claim that it was justified or that it was the Kenyans' fault.

For example in many parts of the country, the BBC radio channels are virtually the only channels available.

Personally I'd quite like to see the BBC disassembled into its core pieces - an independent but license-fee payer funded news agency, a TV production company, and a combined radio-TV channel company . These would all work from seperate locations, completely independetly of each other under their own unique brands, with just the TV/radio aspect retaining the BBC brand. So for example, it is permissable that sometime in the future the sucessor-BBC news company might not be hosted on a BBC channel - many channels could bid for the agencies broadcasting - including current competitors like ITV/C4/Sky etc.

In many respects, that independence and compartmentalisation is how the BBC is supposed to work already - simply enshrining them in different physical companies would make the theory a reality.

Parking's awful on our street so obviously someone who'd come home from a night shift and parked quickly without realising they'd blocked me in.  I was late for work, and needed to get my daughter to nursery, so needed it sorted.

Parking is a major source of conflict on our street... some of our neighbours have come to blows over it before, so it's a bit of a touchy subject.

I'm a lover, not a fighter, and I had no idea which neighbour it was, and didn't want to go knocking on 50 different doors.  Phoned the local police, gave them the reg number and they phone the owner... no reply so they sent round an unmarked response car within 25 mins to sort it.

Two coppers had a look, decided it wasn't worth trying to squeeze my car out and risk scraping the paintwork, so they asked me what I wanted (i.e. towed away, ticketed etc).

I said I just needed to get to work and didn't want to cause anyone grief over something trivial (it's the first time in 7 years it's happened to us).  So the police asked me to wait inside, knocked on the owner's door (turned out to be 5-6 doors down on the other side of the road), woke the owner up, asked for his keys in a friendly way then moved the car 50yds down the road to an empty space.  

Easy peasy, all done in 3 mins with no hassle and no paperwork. It stopped a potential argument between neighbours, I got to work on time, neighbour went back to bed without having to change out of his pajamas, and coppers went on to their next call leaving behind two happy campers.

Good result all round really.

No, you're not just saying. You're complaining. You really think the problem is the rare mental health patient like her who really has little to no quality of life and in constant care, or the 1 in 3 of us who are obese?

That £1500 figure is roughly what it costs per day to keep a patient ventilated and on some meds in the intensive care unit, so that figure seems rather high to me for a mental health patient (unless it's a private institution), and ITU beds are scarce, we don't keep people there forever.

I think your example is an extreme. You need to look at the bigger picture. You could equally balk at some of the costs for medications for things like cancer treatment, yet we have no problem giving those to people.

My worst experience was in Nottingham years ago when I came back after the xmas break to find the house reposessed, so keep an eye out for threatening looking bailiff letters in your landlords name. Maybe just as bad was the time a sketchy land lord in Hyson Green threatened to send some 'people he knew in Manchester' to deal with my parents if I went to the police to report him for assault after I confronted him about where my things had gone when he thought I had moved out fully yet was planning to remove the rest over the remaining 2 weeks my tenancy had to go. He didn't use a tenancy agreement stating that the rent book was proof enough legally, so watch for that.

In Wakefield, the set up was that if we didn't fill up the house/ anyone left then we had a short grace period to find someone new or the landlord would. We were slack so had to deal with some right rejects being foisted on us, a guy who'd been locked up several years for arson but released after the guy who did it (his friend) admitted it after being caught doing it again, and a 40 year old ex-alcoholic who later turned out to have a computer full of child porn. (he got sent down for that) so choose your house mates carefully. I think most shared student places in Sheffield run on the system of if someone moves out it's up to the tenants to make up the rent straight away until the fill the empty room.


I had some dealings with www.studentaccommodationsheffield.com, they were drama free, went out of there way to sort out anything that cropped up and it was good dealing direct with a landlord who lived locally and not some random office/agency or bloke that was always abroad when I wanted something doing.

Theoretically renting is simple. find a place you like and can afford, from a landlord that comes across the right way. Pay your money on time and don't trash the place. L-lord makes sure the place is habitable and gives you grief if it is not as clean as it was when you moved in when you move.

I got invited out of the car and was asked what their names where - and I got them the wrong way round.

After that, it went downhill.

""Do you know your registration number sir?""

""No""

""But it's your vehicle""

""So what?""

""You should know the registration number""

""I don't usually need to care what the registration number is, it's on the front of the car if I want to check""

""Do you know what's in the boot?""

""Not really. Lots of crap""

""I think we'd better check in the boot sir""

I open the boot, and the young 'bad' copper starts pulling out loads of stuff (it was messier than my flat), and after a while pulls out a halfords radio in its' box, in a halfords bag, with a halfords receipt in it. He then asks me ""Where did you get this?""

The older 'good' copper with him rolls his eyes and says ""put it back""

The young 'bad' copper, not wanting to lose face (at least, that's what I assume), pulls out a tyre arm (crossbar type) and says ""...offensive weapon?""

School starts at 8.50, which in itself is a nightmare for people who have office hours jobs, especially if there's a commute involved. I try to work around it and when I'm working from home I walk or cycle with my daughter to school, but if I am doing a contract that starts at 10 in London I have to catch the 9.22 train, and the only way of getting to the station on time after drop off is driving.

Quite apart from that, its probably illegal and definitely not recommended for safety reasons to just dump your kid a few hundred yards from where they need to be. 
The parent/carer in reception, maybe for another year or two are *told* to accompany their children to the classroom door and and hand them over to the teachers, so I'm not sure where the magic extra childminders/people willing and able to transport 10s, possibly hundreds of 4,5 and 6 yet olds to their individual classrooms are going to appear from.

Also, anyone seen any school crossing professionals recently-I haven't. And who's going to take responsibility if one of the kids goes missing?

Negredo is whack lets face it.

true,GratefullyGodless,tennant,Tennant,"   The problem with Moffat is that his own enthusiasm trips him up sometimes, and stretches the bounds of credulity. Like, the Statue of Liberty creeping across New York City. He's a man of big ideas, and no one really reining him in, so those ideas get out, whether they should have or not. 
   
   Plus, he is also inconsistent. The Angels attack by sending people back through time, unless you're on a different planet apparently, in which case they just kill you instead? Oh, and control your body and use it to talk to people?
   
   But, overall, he's had lots of good ideas, and has certainly created some interesting plots and characters. He gave us River Song, Amy Pond, Rory Pond (Ooops, Williams ;) ), and now Clara Oswin. 
   
   A victorian lizard lady, and her blushing butt-kicking bride. A sontaran with brain issues, and a robot that thought it was a man. 
   
   He's given us creepy villains, such as stalking angels, gray skinned people that you don't know are there if you're not looking at them, and carnivorous snowmen, amongst others.
   
   So, Moffat is like any other show runner, he has his ups and downs, BUT, most importantly, he is a fan of the show. Too many intellectual properties are brought down by having someone put in charge that has no idea of what makes that property work. Moffat knows that Doctor, and loves the Doctor, and that shows in his writing.
   
   Which is why, while I may quibble with some of the stuff that he's done, I would much rather have him running the show than some schmuck who hasn't the faintest clue about the Doctor and his history. 
   
   If you want to see the results of that, look at the lame Doctor Who TV movie that Fox did. Ugh.

Just like back then, the new doctor with a new story style, a new cast, new way of how the seasons were set up, and being the first doctor of their era to do a real, full length multi-doc story has led to the biggest surge in doctor who viewers the series has ever seen as fans from both sides of the atlantic boost the popularity of the show.

I mean, you're entitled to your opinion, but please don't think that the show didn't pull the exact same thing multiple times. And each time it led to a surge in popularity the likes of which it hadn't yet even seen.

During the cold war, the Soviets built a brand new embassy in Washington. They were very careful with how they sourced all the materials, e.t.c. to avoid any possibility of bugs or vulnerabilities. They did regular checks for anything out of the ordinary. But this being the cold war, the US was very keen to spy on the Soviets.

One day, somehow, someone in the Soviet embassy discovered a ""crack"" in one of their windows. It was tiny, much less than 1mm. But when they looked more closely at it, they realised the ""crack"" was exactly prism-shaped. It was so precise, they knew it must have been put there deliberately, but they could not figure out why it was there. Eventually someone figured it out - if you shone a laser onto the crack, because it was prism shaped, the light would be reflected exactly back to where it came from. The US were using this to shine an infra-red laser onto the window, and then by measuring the position of the laser that was reflected back, they could measure the vibrations of the window very precisely. From this, they could figure out what was being said in that room. They had managed to cut this prism into one of the windows destined for the new Soviet embassy without being noticed.

The way high-security buildings are built today, like the CIA HQ and also MI6 HQ in London, now have very complicated layouts to prevent this from happening. Some of them are almost literally one building residing inside another, so there is no direct line of sight to any of the windows.

The Ecuadorian embassy probably has dozens of bugs and listening devices aimed at it right now. It's hardly a building built to prevent it from being spied on, it's just an old building. Our governments probably know nearly everything that goes on in there, it must have a million vulnerabilities. Someone at MI5 probably knows what they all had for breakfast this morning.

I don't think how you classify that really matters, because the vast majority of obese people are not that way because of some underlying mental health issue. Therefore their contributions in comparison to the rest are minor.

I don't doubt that there are many people that present to A&amp;E with alcohol related injuries, but the cost of treating a scraped bloody knee is far less than the complex pathologies that are associated with obesity.

Your figure quoted was for alcohol related illnesses and injuries vs obesity related conditions.

It matters when there are comparisons and figures flying about the place. 

&gt; because the vast majority of obese people are not that way because of some underlying mental health issue.

Not sure what would count as vast majority, 1 in 4 people will experience problems with mental health at some point in their life. 

&gt;I don't doubt that there are many people that present to A&amp;E with alcohol related injuries, but the cost of treating a scraped bloody knee is far less than the complex pathologies that are associated with obesity.

But how about the overall cost to the NHS of that person? It is not just the care in A&amp;E, it is the cost of the ambulance called out because they have drunk themselves into unconsciousness, or have fallen and cut their head. It is the the x-rays, CT scans etc to ensure they have not got a brain or neck injury. And then that same person does it all over against the next weekend. 

Incidentally I don't disagree that overweight people are a drain on the NHS, Cardiovascular disease is a primary cause of death, and diet plays a large part of that, as does smoking.

If you're renting privately I have the following comments. 

Avoid any properties with Parklane involved, seriously. My friends have told me many, many horror stories. The places look wonderful at first but when there are problems (and there always are) they don't fix them. One friend complained about a leaking bathroom pipe weekly for around 2 months, luckily she was out of the house when the toilet came crashing through the rotten flooring/kitchen ceiling. I was tempted by one of their properties recently so just set a general Facebook status asking of anyone had rented from them. I'm not exaggerating here, within 30 mins I had 50 replies with horror stories and people having to take them to court to get deposits back etc. The stories were from 10 years ago to last year.

Also avoid Haus Properties. If you do a quick Google, you will see that they changed their name from something else a few years ago because their old name was actually nationally known and had been featured on Watchdog! (I can find this again if you want?)

My boyfriend had a good experience with Stoneacre recently and I liked Northern Apartments. I've also had good experience with Whitegates (but that was a while ago), they were good but my landlord was an arsehole. 

My first rental in Leeds was with Falkingham Properties and the owner was genuinely lovely. 

My current place is somewhere I found on Gumtree. I got tired of paying useless estate agents to fob me off. Now, when I have an issue I speak with my landlord directly which is much better. 

EDIT - sorry but I've just realised that I've kinda recommended you look on Gumtree. Just to be clear, I'd only recommend this if you already know the areas around Leeds quite well and are very confident in what you're doing. If you're a first year and live outside of Leeds, I wouldn't rent from a private landlord.

I'm not up in arms at all about the incident. I didn't like it at the time, it was embarrassing, and I still don't like it. But I'm not saying it's a black mark on our club. We've had our fair share of black marks over the past few years from past owners downwards; the rant at Fergie doesn't compare.  That still doesn't make it acceptable. But to me that's as far as it goes.  But between that incident, his Jekyll &amp; Hyde nature, his nightmare matches in the domestic cups and vs. Stoke and his lack of contribution at all in the 2nd half of the season, I just think he's nothing more than a fairly promising youngster who didn't make the grade.  To me, there was nothing special at all about Shelvey, he was just another player.

His stats were poor: he played 47 league games for us in three years and in that time contributed one league goal and a solitary assist. He [couldn't place a shot to save his life](http://basstunedtored.com/2013/06/12/shelveys-shocking-shot-placement/) and he wasted chance after chance. He had the lowest clear-cut chance conversion rate of any of our players in the last 3 seasons of 13% as well. I just don't, and never have, understood the hype about him.

He's not above criticism. So he's fairly young and English; he's not alone in that regard, but there are plenty of better players who would've got in the team in front of him. He wasn't even the best young British CM in our squad and even Allen and Hendo can't even guarantee a slot in the first team at the moment when Lucas and Gerrard are fit. So he was our 5th or 6th choice CM. £6m for him is a fantastic bit of business.

Anyway, he's gone. I wish him the best of luck, but I'm certainly not the only one who thinks he'd never be good enough to make a significant contribution to this squad.

Their advertising feature is you don't even need to be able to hold a pen!

Don't get me wrong, I'd sooner have payday loan firms, which are regulated, respect bankruptcy, rather than loan sharks.  But I think many people who use them, the fact Wonga has an iPhone app, demonstrate the issues.  Why not hock the iPhone!

People live beyond their means, too many people don't think they need to save money.  They are always too poor.  This is shocking, because the same people have TVs, Sky, Phones etc.  Yes these things I would want, I would feel like a massive looser in our society without.  But I'd never buy without some cash savings in the bank.

The issue is people are going overdrawn without knowing that they will.  You should have enough cash so that any surprise life throws you (loosing job, having dependants need cash) you have a buffer for.

Ultimately payday loans should be a last resort, one that is fairly safe in terms of consequences (without it, the credit score would have been defaulting).

However, this firm, advertised directly that they should be the first port of call, not your bank.  *fill in loads of forms* is my objection.

It was more an ironic outburst. Socialism and conservatism don't historically go hand in hand, the obvious exceptions being bailouts for banksters and militants.

&gt; militant

It's the right word and a simple word, one far more appropriate than ""soldier"" which has a positive marketing campaign obfuscating their reality. Militant captures the grunts at the bottom to the ""intellectuals"" at the top and has symmetry with those on the other side. Soldiers deserve respect, militants deserve less than death.

&gt; big words

Juxtaposition is the only one that seems to merit that criticism, but I'm having to make assumptions because you haven't been explicit.

My conclusion is as follows: the Convervative Party (only especially as there is bipartisanship) act as military trade unionists demanding more and more for their special class (secret courts, benefits, pensions, etc) and love nothing more than big government for themselves and small to non-existent for the public.

My point, however, is that the rate of 2,000% only applies *if* you take the loan over a year. If you borrow £100 for two weeks, the representative APR is 5,835% but the real-time interest is less than £20. 

If you borrow £20 from a mate for a week, and buy him a pint when you repay him as a thank you (£3, let's say), that seems totally reasonable. £3 interest on £20 over a week is totally fair, right?

Because it's just over 770% APR. Whoops, suddenly £3 on £20 over a week seems extortionate. 770% APR!!!! That's mindblowingly high! Your friend is ripping you off at that APR rate! But it's still only £3 on £20 over a week.

This is because the A in APR stands for *annual*. That's why it's inapplicable for a loan over a short space of time.

My point is: look at the real-time cost of the loan when it's only over a week or so.

The old clichéd response they give to start ups is ""you want me to invest x amount of money for x% of nothing"" or ""how do you value 'nothing' at x amount of money?"" etc.

Lord Sugar's investment really is an investment from scratch. If you have the expertise and a very minimal plan you get the ground floor investment. 

Look at the previous 2 winners, a geeky guy who has expertise with inventing but no real finalised product or viable business plan.

There's a whole raft of legislation in the Housing Act to use against them. 

&gt;  Also, regarding the bills, this is total bull shit, when the tenant leave you can send a notice to the utility companies that your tenant has left and that you accept all charges from X date onwards

I was referring to the mortgage, repairs, gas safety checks which you still have to do if the tenant doesn't pay and not the gas/electric/water.

As to your last point you seem to misunderstand the purpose of a Section 21. Its a ""no-fault"" notice.

&gt; So, don't tell me about the law or be-little me with your oversize head, I'm very well aware of my position.

Apparently not given you seem to think you have few rights to defend against a bad landlord.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The idea had everything going for it, so it's actually strange that they eventually decided against it. Remember, Humanists and Atheists are included in other religious programmes on the BBC. That's why its called the ""Religion &amp; Ethics"" department, rather than just the ""Religion"" department. And it had the support of many key people, and nobody seemed to object. Why did it fail?

&gt;Our arguments about Thought for the Day have been frequently rehearsed and have the support even of the presenters of the Today programme, John Humphreys and Evan Davis. We simply cannot understand why the BBC resists this small change that would prove that it is serious about proper representation of all opinions on the airways.

In my opinion, it's the NSS themselves that ultimately killed the idea. They were invited onto the review, and they used it as a platform to argue that ""Thought for the Day"" should not exist at all. Great debating tactics, guys. It's fairly obvious from the tone of the chairman's writing that he did not think highly of the ""lengthy debate"" he had with the NSS either. It sounds like it was just a chore.

Now go and have a look at the NSS website. Every article they put out is critical of religion, critical of the people involved in religion, and critical of organisations that engage with religion. That is the primary aim of their whole organisation, to be critical of religion. Not that this in itself is bad, but it does cause another problem.

And this causes an issue, because the BBC's religious programming, and ""Thought for the Day"" in particular, is very inoffensive, very positive, and very uncritical. And then they're faced with an organisation which does almost soley the opposite, and does nothing *but* be critical of religion.

So while nobody seemed to object to the idea of Humanists appearing on the show, I would bet that nobody involved in religious programming on the BBC would want anything to do with the NSS. If I ran ""Thought for the Day"", I sure as fuck wouldn't want to deal with them. Even forgetting the fact they openly accuse your show of being ""propaganda"" and think it should be taken off the air, I'd also be very concerned that the NSS would just try and use it as a platform to be critical of religion, which is hardly an unfounded fear, given that is practically all they do. And religious groups are not allowed to use ""Thought for the Day"" as a platform to be critical of other religions, so there's no way NSS would be allowed to do the same. I mean, can you imagine vetting the kinds of ""Thoughts for the Day"" that NSS members would come up with? What a fucking nightmare. The number of subtle jabs at religion they would have tried to slip in, the tiresome debates it would spawn over what is and isn't acceptable to say, and the obvious potential for them to go off the script and just start ranting like an angsty teenager. I'm betting that ultimately, someone at the BBC decided that it's just easier not to have to deal with them, so they put a stop to the idea.

So well done to the NSS. This is what making life difficult and burning bridges gets you. People don't want to deal with you. And it's a great shame too, because there are probably loads of Humanists and Atheists that would have wanted to appear on the show.",0,1372898862,null,0,false,0,cavjorn,t3_1hkjur,t1_cavjorn,t3_1hkjur,null,1430590819,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

We haven't quite seen it come to fruition yet. I just found out today that Hurt is essentially confirmed as the Time War Doctor. Obviously we won't know if they pull it off until the 50th actually airs and makes its way to the end credits, but so far my thoughts on that news are:

1. What a disappointment. A hidden Doctor, that could be from *any* point in the entire history of his timespan, and they go with the cop-out and stick him in the Time War. He could've been anything. Before Hartnell, so far in the future that they don't reveal his number, between Troughton and Pertwee, there were *so many possibilities*. I'm disappointed to see ""the Doctor's greatest secret"" so rooted in an idea from strictly the modern series.

2. If they *must* do a Time War Doctor, which it appears that they are, I think John Hurt will be *much* better than Hugh Laurie ever could've been. The few lines that we've gotten so far, and the pain in his eyes from the few seconds we've seen sold me on his ability to do it.

3. That being said. They are *not* going to deliver on the Time War. The Time War is to the 50th as the TARDIS is to Journey to the Center of The TARDIS. It is **never** going to live up to anyone's expectations, which is another reason why I'm extremely disappointed that they even went that route. The news that John Hurt is the 'at war' Doctor is a double edged sword. John Hurt is going to pull off that Doctor flawlessly. In no way is *he* going to be the problem. The Problem is going to be everything surrounding him. Us actually getting to *see* the Time War. I was wrong before, seeing an at war Doctor will work out just fine. Seeing the war itself is what is actually going to be the problem.

Then again, I said it myself, I was wrong before. I'm going to be hoping with all my heart that they pull it off from now until November. Honestly though, I just don't see it happening.",0,1372901789,null,0,false,0,cavkj5y,t3_17zm5e,t1_cavkj5y,t1_cavjugb,null,1430590421,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

We were already running by this point but about 10 seconds into what we though would be a terrifying sprint we spot a police car, parked in a church car park. I run over, tap on the window and point towards the guilty party, what I met with subsequently made me extremely sceptic towards the met for a while. 

Staring back at me are two overweight men shoveling kebabs into their mouths, (the latter probably being the reason they didn't get out and help us as their car had a perfect field of vision over the ground we were being chased on) so as I had selfishly interrupted the meals entertainment I wasn't met with the kindest of all greetings. Shaking and slightly drunk I tried my best to explain the random attack that had played out in front of them. ""Dint see nuffink mate"" was his initial response and I, having watched the armed man and his dog trudge away whilst I was explaining this to him was a little upset. Then the chaps decided to elbow their way in and 'mediate', not the best path trodden.

So, we end up attempting to trudge down to the local constabulary which is closed (it was 4am), so we ended up adding it to the various stories we reverted back to when conversation wasn't thriving.",0,1372904391,null,0,false,0,cavla8v,t3_1hk7d5,t1_cavla8v,t3_1hk7d5,null,1430590066,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

EDIT: Scratch that, here's how it should go down:

As we saw in  10's regeneration, he became 'self aware' that the regeneration process was not fair, and that for doing all those good things, he loses a life. So I think 11 should go somewhere along those lines.

11 realizes that he's starting to regenerate, for whatever reason will be given. He knows that he has 1 more life left until he dies, (Time lords have 13 regens) and is furious, once again, that he is rewarded by none other than dying. Clara walks into the TARDIS, and sees the Doctor glowing slightly. She asks what's wrong and why he's glowing this yellow energy, and he explains the regneration process to Clara, holding back his tears. Clara starts to panic, and uses the mental link to summon River Song to the TARDIS. River uses her Vortex Manipulator to get to Clara, and is panicked when she sees the Doctor starting to regenerate. Clara, who is two-times more panicked than River, starts asking lots of questions as to what they should do. The Doctor, overhearing these questions, gets irritated, over-irritated, because of the regeneration process, and starts the actual process. Because of his anger, he wants Clara to shut up, and shoots regeneration energy at Clara, knocking her unconscious. He does the same to River, but that merely knocks her down and out the TARDIS doors, nearly leaving a wound. River gets up and confronts him, telling him to stop. He calms down and somehow, stops the process midway, just long enough to say his final words. 'Spoilers.' And continues shooting energy at River, until she's almost dead, and he's done with the process. The new Doctor, almost crying at the sight of River and Clara unconscious, uses all the strength he has to carry them all the way through the long, TARDIS coridoors, to the sick bay, where he runs back to the Library to get a Time Lord Medical book. The final thing you see is Clara and River both lying asleep in the sick bay, as Clara wakes up, and the episode ends.",0,1372910337,null,0,1372911343,0,cavn1qe,t3_1hlkpe,t1_cavn1qe,t3_1hlkpe,null,1430589234,-4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-4

This was not his TARDIS, it had lights scattered all over and was a completely different color. A tan-ish dull color, He didn't like it at all. Yet he remembered it from past regenerations. As He recalled the past regenerations that contained this version of the TARDIS, he knew it could only mean 1 of 3 people could be on-board.

	“Rose, Martha, Donna?” Shouted The Doctor who wondered who would respond.
“Doctor?” Responded Rose wondering who Martha and Donna were?

	Rose didn’t recognize this Doctors voice, but He recognized hers instantly. He knew it could only be Rose. The Doctor ran over to Rose and slid towards the end of his sprint, and reached his hand out towards Rose. Rose grasped his hand lightly not recognizing the feel of his hand. Rose looked at him inquisitively. 

	“Rose you may not know me, but I definitely know you.” Said the Doctor trying to clear the elephant in the room.
“So I'm guessing that means that your another Doctor?”Replied Rose
“Yes, I am, and I'm not supposed to be here, or even on the TARDIS.”Said The Doctor as he looked around curiously.
“If you're not supposed to be here then why are you?”Said Rose

	“Well its kinda complicated but..”said the Doctor “I'll try and short it down a bit”.
My ultimate rule of travel was to never was to never cross my own time-line but sometimes accidents happen... even to me.  Apparently my TARDIS and your TARDIS collided causing an immediate exchange of power transferring all data and power to this TARDIS and the power and data from this one into mine. Also in the process switching me and the other Doctor out.

	“Then how do we get them... um... you... The Doctors switched back?”Said Rose confused on the whole situation.
“Simple, we have to find the other TARDIS and me and him will switch places.”Said The Doctor

	The Doctor Continued, I can probably find some trace of the transfer and use that to communicate to the other TARDIS, and then we can find a place to meet and sort this all out before it gets all complicated.

“Where there’s one thing I didn't tell you about our current situation.”said Rose

	The Doctor looked over at her and said “And what's that?”.
“We were trying to escape from...”Rose was interrupted by a loud bang as the TARDIS shook.

	A loud beeping noise rang through the TARDIS, and the doctor ran over and flipped the switches on the panels in a chaotic motion.

But it's not the most important factor in losing weight obviously, in fact it's almost bound to disappoint even if you are really committed to a good regimen, because muscle weighs more than fat and you'll be replacing part of the fat you lose with muscle.  

Bottom line, controlling caloric input is the most important part of a weight loss programme, but not faddy or extreme diets, just healthier eating with more fruit, veg, fibre and possibly protein, and less sugar without fibre and the more unhealthy fats.

If you read through it, you'll see that Australia is a ""listed non-EU country"" which means that if you meet the other conditions, you'll be able to bring your dog into the UK without needing to put him into six-months of quarantine.

The conditions include:

* The dog must be microchipped
* The dog must have up-to-date vaccinations against rabies; if it's his first rabies vaccination (not a booster) he must have had the vaccination at least three weeks before you travel
* The dog must have a vet-approved treatment for tapeworm administered between 1-5 days before you intend to bring him to the UK

Also it's not enough to just get those things done, they must all be done by a vet who participates in the ""pet passport"" scheme, otherwise you won't get the official certificate which will allow him to bypass quarantine. I'm not sure how to find vets who are able to do this in Australia, there should be some kind of list on a gov.au site somewhere, or you could just ring round some of the larger vet practices in your town.

There's one other thing to consider -- even with the pet passport certification you can only bring the dog into the UK via certain airlines/routes ([list here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/200594/pets-air-routes.pdf)) -- although it looks like that includes most carriers who'd be doing an Aus-&gt;UK flight anyway.

For once I actually trust that whatever the club go for will be the right choices. Happy with nearly every player we've bought/are linked to and with every player out. With this in mind, unless they make some silly, out of nowhere purchases, I will fully back whoever they go for, success or not, as I prob also thought it was a good idea at the time 
i.e. if Luis Alberto performs very badly for whatever reason next year I won't call for his head too quickly not blame the club as it seemed sensible at the time.
For what it's worth regarding rumoured links IMO;

MID
Mkhitaryan- seems like he would add goals from midfield and love everything I read about him but he can also seem technically inept at times from what I've seen, esp against big opposition.
Atsu-going on what I've seen, he's a speed merchant and little more
Gameiro- can fuck right off, esp now that sturridge is firing and aspas looks sharp.

CB
Papadopoulos- again love everything I see, I think he would complement Agger well but his passion and temperament, while it might be an asset, could also be a big liability. Plus dodgy knee and I don't think he would listen to advice/instruction too well from the sounds of it.
Alderweireld- looks, as someone already said, like he could be a lesser version of Vertonghen. Although we wont know till he plays in England plus there doesn't seem to be too many other options suiting what we're looking for (dont think Sakho will move esp with a new manager)
Might be controversial but I  don't think it would be the end of the world if we kept Skrtel and didn't sign any more centre backs. Wisdom and Kelly could compete for right back/centre back cover (although I would prefer either got loaned out to somewhere they could play cb weekly) and Skrtel and Toure compete for vacant spot. Worst case scenario Skrtel plays poorly again and Kolo can't keep up, in which case we might have to take a chance on Kelly/Wisdom?

OTHER
Would like to add that aside from these I love all the quality youngsters we're linked to; Canos, Kane, Biteco, that def mid from Spain who sounds good. Really shows were thinking about the future, which is great!

Some games they are extraordinary and others they aren't however I find their styles besides Hazard's don't actually offer a reliable plan. With Moses on when he was in form you knew he would run at people make space get crosses in. He was reliable and I hope it is the same with Schurrle run at people drag players around so the likes of Mata, Hazard or Oscar can get some space and really open up teams. 

Now the engine room. I don't want to pretend I know what works. In games where we have a lot of possession I like when Luiz and Lampard are in midfield because they are more dynamic with their passing against teams sitting back. However I would rather have Mikel in DM first choice every day of the week for defensive duties probably followed by Ramires then Luiz then Lampard. I don't think you can apply a one size fits all solution however I think we need another option in the engine room as Lampard is aging , Essien has fitness concerns and Romeu still has room to grow. On a side note Ramires really frustrated me this year some games he has extreme amounts of energy is involved in everything and then others he had the first touch of a donkey and seemed to ruin every thing he touched.

Leaving the best behind to go for coherent team mean someone will end up getting furious. With that in mind, I think, a 4-3-3 or a 4-3-2-1 will definitely work better for us. We can always play Mata and Hazard/Schurrle as the 2 in 4-3-2-1. 

Also, I would say leaving Oscar or hazard or even schurrle out of starting 11 to favour lampard will be a bad idea. Lampard is getting older while others are just starting. 

So, if I will have to choose, I will go with 4-3-2-1. Oscar, Mikel, Ramires to fill the back 3, with Lampard and essien as backup. On Oscar's side, we can use mata or hazard for better linkup play. On the ramires side, we will need a winger so schurrle or Moses will do good. 

Alternatively, if Schurrle performs well, we can do Mata, Mikel, Oscar at back 3, with Lampard, ramires and essien as backup. Ofcourse, Mata will play a bit higher than the rest. For the two positions, Schurrle/Moses on Mata's side, and Hazard/Ramires on Oscar's side. That way, we will have someone on both ends to provide the width for closed games, but midfield will still be quite locked.

Now, the reason he could be wearing a mix of 8 and 9's clothing could be that he becomes a little unhinged from being exiled by Rose and starts wearing clothes from other regenerations of the Doctor.

Rant:

I agree. Inconsiderate people dropping rubbish is one of my great hates. I live near the meadows (big park near the middle of town) and after a nice day I hate walking through there, there is so much litter left. I don't understand the thinking - 'It's a lovely day, let's go down to the park and relax, and leave our rubbish to fuck it up for everyone else.'

The annoying part is you're pretty much forced to walk past a bin to leave the meadows in most directions; it's not like you have to go out of your way to tidy up after yourself.

 I have seen 16 workers and 4 trucks cleaning up the morning after a nice day - that's my council tax being wasted instead of being spent on books for kids or fixing pot holes. Same walking along the street - plenty of bins about, you might just have to carry your empty crisp packet 30 feet to put it in one.

TL;DR, If you don't put your rubbish in a bin, you're a fucking arsehole.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"Making up my own questions to answer, hopefully spurs some discussion (perhaps OP can make up questions for the players to kickstart chatter).

&gt;What type of player is Tom Carroll, how is he best utilized?

He is a traditional play maker who is comfortable playing either deep or further up front in midfield. He isn't a prolific goal scorer (at current level) nor does his frame allow him to be the most solid defender, so I wouldn't tag him as box-to-box. He can run the ball if it is on but very much favours his passing game. Honestly he reminds me of a mini Modric, just minus the fact that Modric could beat a man with his first touch every time.

I think his best position would be a non-DM role in a midfield 4-3-3, it allows him to play from deep when transitioning from defence to attack and move further forward to support when on attack. I think a midfield 3 of:

Carroll - Sandro - Holtby 

Would be a perfect blend. Sandro to break down the opponent and then get it to Carroll/Holtby who can spray it further forward. On attack it would look something like:

LCB - Sandro - RCB (standing at the back)

RFB - Carroll  - LFB (providing a supporting backbone)

RW - ST - Holtby - LW (trying to penetrate the lines)

The front guys would try and unlock the defence and if need be could play it back to Carroll who would be very good at moving the ball back into a dangerous position.

&gt;Do you think Carroll has the potential to legitimately crack the spurs squad?

Yes. He is our most promising youth player in a group that includes Caulker, Rose and Townsend. Three guys who looked to have cracked the squad already. If there is one player spurs are truly lacking it is the pure creative type, the (dare I say it) Modric replacement. With Paulinho, Dembele and Sandro we have the new age 'complete midfielders' who can tackle, pass, run and maybe even shoot. In Holtby we have the embodiment of enthusiasm + a player who thrives on one touch football. Holtby is best using his quick wit and feet to link up the midfield with the guys at the front. Siggy in my opinion is best on the left, so doesn't overlap positionally. 

Carroll has that eagle head that you see on players like Iniesta and Modric, he is always looking around off the ball and updating his mental mapping of the field (who is where? where is the space?). When he receives the ball he already knows exactly what he wants to do with it, he is the one player at spurs I think can truly and consistently pick out the correct pass. To give you an idea of how highly I rate this kid, he is in my opinion already beyond Huddlestone in what he can offer the squad, and we all know that Huddlefro will very easily be sold to a PL team. Seems obvious to me then that Carroll is already PL quality.

&gt;What should happen with Carroll next season?

Stark choked Ripley to show that Luther's approach to justice isn't right, it's an example and a shock tactic.  He's behaving as he's sees Luther would, which in fairness isn't far from the truth, the main thing missing is that Ripley has done nothing morally wrong so would be unlikely to feel Luther's wrath.

Ripley was talking about the man that put his hand into the blender to remove his fingers, and therefore prints.  Ripley was pressing Luther on how to deal with it and wanted to bring in the suspect.  Luther put Ripley off, then called the man to tip him off.  You'd never do this if you thought the suspect was guilty, you'd turn up unexpected and take them in, which is what Ripley was asking to do.

So, he knows at that point that Luther has perverted the course of justice and is helping a murderer from walking free.  In Luther's mind, the man was justified in murdering his tormentor, and is suffering remorse from doing so - he sees the remorse and the death of his daughter as punishment enough.  In reality, as horrible as such an act is, the tormentor could have been suffering mentally or any number of things - and in either case didn't deserve to die for the crime.

Ripley is actually doing the *right* thing by our own moral standards.  Luther is a criminal and should be locked up.  But, he's an awesome criminal that for every bad thing he does, he does two good.  He's sort of like Robin Hood I guess.  If there was a modern day Robin Hood that came into your house and stole your TV, PC, iPod, phone, etc. from you and gave them to the needy in Africa/India/etc. you'd be pissed off and want him arrested.

I think to the police it was really obvious that the dad had done the murder, they could just 'feel' it due to the parent's reactions and their years of experience.  This is why the case got picked as the trap, other police officers had investigated and knew who the murderer was (perhaps there was another witness we didn't get to see, or the parents had been interviewed before already).  To them it was as clear as day, an almost perfect trap.",0,1372930256,null,0,false,0,cavrbyf,t3_1hko5v,t1_cavrbyf,t1_cavmjin,null,1430587140,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

Small three-person family run brewery in the North of Scotland, capacity isn't adequate yet so I have to pre-order crates from my local bottle shops.

Fyne Ales - Avalanche/Jarl.  On sale in Oddbins across the country apparently.  Jarl is a delicious hoppy session IPA at just under 4%.  Avalance a bit stronger and hoppier.

Williams Bros - Good Times/Birds and Bees/Ceilidh.  First two have interesting botanical ingredients added in and are excellent food beers.  Ceilidh is a delicious pilsner style.  Larger brewery but with a diverse range of interesting beers, including fruit beers, heather ale and pine ale.  Quite widely available I think.

Mikkeller - Nelson Sauvin Single Hop IPA.  This is just incredible and it's sweeping the board across most of the review sites.  Expensive, but packed with complex citrus flavours.  Hard to get but try if you can.  Not Scottish!

I have to say, growing up in England (Cotswolds) and moving to Scotland, Scottish real ales/craft beers are nicer IMO.  I'm regularly back in England and go to ale festivals and try anything new I see in pubs, and I still don't like it as much as the stuff coming out of the three Scottish breweries above.

&gt;
&gt;The Bristol Cycling Manifesto was launched at the end of May – now a month old there are more than 900 signatures on the petition website. This isn’t good enough.
&gt;
&gt;There are approximately 16,500 daily cyclists in Bristol, and I’d wager that not a single one of you is 100% happy with your daily journey. There will be a pinch point, a crossing or a junction that either puts you in conflict with another road user or at worse direct danger of intimidation or physical harm.
&gt;
&gt;There are at least three spots on my daily journey to work that I would like to see changed or altered. I bet you’ve got a similar number or more. This is why I signed the ‘Freedom to Ride’ manifesto and why you should, too.

I think this side is very solid with our weakest point being LB. Coming off the bench i'd like to have Ade and also Townsend to rotate with Lennon most games. Holtby also switching out for Dembele/Paulinho as necessary.  
I think Dembele is going to be even better this season with more licence to push forward and Sandro because Sandro.  
Rose may struggle if we are attacking heavily down the left and i think Sandro will be tracking across to help out a lot. I can also see Lennon struggling in a more advanced position where you would expect to see him chip in a few more goals.

Ima shake things up a little.

Sell Ade and Hudd for the rumoured 5 each, and Scotty for his 2 to QPR, leaving me with 32m. Keep Defoe.

Benteke comes in for 16m. Villa in for 10.

Starting 11 would mix between these two, dependant on form and the team we're facing:

_

Paulinho, Sandro, Dembele

Lennon/Bale, Villa/Benteke, Bale/Dempsey/Siggy

OR

Sandro, Moussa/Paulinho

Lennon, Bale, Villa/Clint/Siggy

Benteke/Villa

----

Everyone seems to want to go all in for the 4-3-3 without remembering that our star man, G-Baz would be more restricted.

The 4-3-3 I posted gives options for inverted strikers, as well as traditional wingers, as AVB like, but I think I would almost prefer the 4-2-3-1 I concocted.

This allows Gareth to remain in his free role, still retaining the winger in Lennon and the inverted forward in Villa/Siggy on the left.

I think it's important we utilise Gareth in the best way possible, more than anything.

-----

Obviously in my 4-2-3-1, Paulinho would come on to shake things up, and the other attacking options are marked with the '/'s. Of course, Tommy Carroll comes on for a little stability in the late game. Oh! And schlepp Andros into the mix there once in a while. And Lewis Holtby in there somewhere, too!

I think Benteke would prefer to play with someone behind him, like Gareth, and would hence thrive there, whilst Villa would make the most of the 4-3-3 as a lone striker, the target up front, if you will. What I worry about bringing Villa in is that he won't be our main man in the attack, Gareth will be as long as he stays with us. But I don't think that would be a problem with a 4-3-3, as Bale will be pushed left or right.

---

That pretty much answers all the questions, I think.

---

Defence to attack sees the Walker-Lennon partnership thrive, as well as Rose/BAE moving up, when we're on the left. I worry when we move down the right, BAE seems to find himself moving too far forward, so really, I'd only want one full back to push up. Sandro always remains defensive, only really moving forward to support or shoot like the goal vs fulham.

Back to defence, our midfield is solid as fuck supporting the back for with the front 3/4 ready for a counter. Lennon was especially brilliant at tracking back last season, so more of that from Azza, but leaving Villa and Benteke, or Bale and Benteke, or Bale and Villa for a speedy counter.

Tipping isn't standard in pubs in the UK - that's probably not something you'll be able to control much, but be aware that if you do attract actual Brits they won't expect to tip, so pay your staff a reasonable wage without tips.

- Some kind of real ale. London Pride will do to start with - Spitfire or Doombar if you can get it, Guinness is fine, maybe a Greene King IPA as well or something else from the major brewers. That's a passable selection. Must be served at cellar temperature, which is 15-17 Celsius. I guess that's about 60 Fahrenheit. Guinness is the only exception to this - no other ale is served that cold, and personally I like Guinness at cellar temperature as well. If you can get proper casks and [hand pumps](http://www.funkyrhino.com/TrainingMaterials/images/pic010.jpg), do - almost every pub has pumps. Serving bottled isn't unforgivable, but pumps are much more authentic. Most pubs have three to five ales on at any one time - specialty ale pubs can have ten or more.
- In addition to about three or four ales on, a couple of European lagers. I like Staropramen, but Carling/Stella/Carlsberg/Heineken/Grolsch are all more common. You very occasionally see Coors or Bud on - try to avoid that, it'll seem inauthentic. Stick with European.
- Some kind of (alcoholic) cider. Something sweet and fizzy is fine - most places here have Strongbow, which is almost undrinkably sweet. Something a bit nicer is Aspall's, which is becoming more common these days. If you can get something like Stowford Press, do.
- I don't know if it's possible to get proper scrumpy in the US, but if you can, do, and if you can't, [think about making your own, because it's really easy](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/sep/14/how-to-make-cider). Old Rosie is an example.

Glenmorangie, Glenfiddich, Glenlivet, Ardbeg, Talisker, Lagavulin. Whisky should be served neat in a rocks glass, ice only if asked for. A little jug of water is acceptable with the nicer ones.
- Spirits mounted on [optics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_spirits_measure), if you want to look authentic. Almost everywhere except for cocktail bars has the commonly used spirits on optics, due to the Weights and Measures act of 1985. As far as the spirits you should have goes, make sure you've got plenty of vodka (whatever. Smirnoff is fine) and gin (Gordon's/Plymouth). Usually there's a JD on an optic as well for mixed drinks.
- A shelf of miscellaneous spirits. You can put a couple of nicer gins on here if you want - Bombay Sapphire and Hendrick's are good starters, but there's hundreds of good London gins. Branch out. You should make sure you've got some fruity spirits - Passoa (passionfruit liqueur) is good. Archers (peach schnapps) is almost mandatory. Any other spirits or liqueurs you feel like having can go here as well - Tia Maria, rum (white/dark/spiced), Absinthe, brandy, tequila, Grand Marnier, and other cocktail ingredients like bitters and Tabasco.
- A couple of bottles of wine - white in the fridge, red not. Doesn't have to be amazing. A chardonnay, a pinot grigio, a pinot noir and a rioja would probably do. Served by the glass. Probably don't have a wine list - wine in a pub is drinkable and that's all you need to know about it.
- Soft drinks/mixers: lemonade (in the UK, lemonade means sparkling and clear, like Sprite. Schweppes is a common brand), coke &amp; diet coke, OJ, tonic water, soda water, lime cordial, possibly pineapple or tomato juice if you want to be fancy. Ginger ale.
- Walkers crisps, if you can get them. They're like Lay's, but they say 'Walker's' on them instead. That'll make any Englishman feel right at home straight away. Other bar snacks: [Nobby's nuts](http://www.nobbys.co.uk/), [Mr. Porky pork scratchings](http://www.mrporky.co.uk/), maybe some Kit Kats.

Any questions, I'd be happy to answer. I can also advise on meals, but I'm more experienced in drinks and snacks.

true,philthehumanist,null,null,"Stephen Lawrence was brutally murdered in broad daylight in the street. He was one of those average, normal kids who wasn't in to gang violence and was a decent pupil at school some saying he had a promising football career. The guys who killed him were the sort of racist bigots you find in the EDL who are begging to do time for being really nasty pieces of work. Video's filmed on camera phones eventually surfaced of them simulating ""how to kill"" with the usual horrific racist language you might expect. The public finally made up their mind and demanded something be done. Arrests were slow to take place, police seemed indifferent to follow up evidence, the local community had begun to get angry.

The police seemed to do everything in their power to screw the case up. People turned up on mass to the trials to throw food and jeer at the accused and there was a lot of worry that justice was going to turn vigilante style. The press began to get heavily involved and you saw Stephens face, his distraught family and very angry people all over the news for a while. IT seemed to go on for ever - each time it hit the front page it was police corruption, failure of the justice system, institutional racism meanwhile 5 clearly very nasty individuals who were the cause of all this were walking free.

Because no one was convicted a police inquiry was commissioned and it turned out that institutional racism was rife in the police force. This came as little surprise to many but further stoked a lot of hatred towards the police. The Daily Mail stepped in with a front page headline accusing them of murder and to ""Sue us if we're wrong"". The irony that The Mail took this case on wasn't missed by anyone, but it further stoked the flames and it was rare that anyone in the country hadn't discussed the issue. No one was imprisoned and people were very angry. It was a brave move by a newspaper - but many saw it as very necessary. The government was now involved and Jack Straw stepped in to try and sort things out, documentaries were being made - a lot of people were calling for the killers to be bought to justice. On each case the same result came back from the police - no evidence, unfounded claims. Faith in the police force was at an all time low and it seemed that no one could do anything.

Eventually two of the gang had a go at a black police officer and they were sent to prison. The law was over turned that meant you could now be accused of a murder for a second time (if acquitted before) because of all this. The others were involved in various crimes for high level drug trafficking and various petty theft - justice seemed to be taking place.

To realise how long all this has gone on - it was only last year that ""new evidence"" was found and they eventually accused two of the gang to life sentences. The memorial centre created in Lawrence's name was vandalised and there was talk of it being a small part of the reason why the summer riots kicked off - this thing isn't going away as well.

America's involvement in WWII was mixed.

Don't pretend your involvement in WWII wasn't one of self-interest and hegemony at least as much and if not more than altruism.

Absolutely.  I am neither a pacifist nor in principle against things military - I'm a bit of a military history nerd as it goes.  I believe it is possible to serve as a soldier with professionalism, honour and integrity, however it's very hard to do so under a political class with an expansionist imperial agenda (even when its mostly by proxy as is ours).  Projecting power is always problematic, but limiting ourselves to a self-defence force isn't something most of our (military and political) establishment are prepared to countenance, and so soldiers will be sent to do immoral and illegal things in the name of being able to sit at the top table, to play the great game, to project power, to take more than our share of global resources and to continue to keep the global south and BRIC competition in check for our corporations.  Corporations which frankly no longer give a fuck about the Western taxpayers who have funded globalisation to put them in their globally dominant positions and are already making long term plans to fund better lives elsewhere and screw their benefactors at home.

---
Lloris

Walker Kaboul Dawson Rose

Dembele Sandro Paulinho

Bale ??? Villa

---
With ??? obviously being our brand new striker, unless we keep Adebayor. Bale and Villa are used to cutting inside and will play the inverted winger roles.

When we're not in possession, I expect Sandro to drop back and shield the defence, however in attack I think this will switch quickly - Sandro will move up the pitch in possession and look to quickly release Paulinho, Bale, Villa or ??? in attack. When we're in possession I'd actually expect to see Dembele as our most withdrawn midfielder. None of these roles are cast in stone however, and I fully expect an interchangeability in the roles of the three midfielders, which can be no bad thing.

However, I don't expect this to be the only formation we play, or with mainly just these players. I expect Gylfi and Holtby to get more game time as both have the potential to be very versatile players. I think we'll also still see 4-2-3-1 when AVB sees fit, with any 2 of Dembele/Paulinho/Sandro/Holtby in the centre, and Bale or Gylfi playing in the hole. I think this system would also suit Lennon far better, playing as an out-and-out right winger - when he's played as an inverted winger on the left I've never really been convinced.

I very much doubt this. A key component of the AVB 4-3-3 is having the FB go high up the pitch in attack with the CB's splitting and the DM dropping back to cover. It allows one more player in attack and with the FB's providing width players like Bale and Villa receive more freedom.


&gt;I'd actually expect to see Dembele as our most withdrawn midfielder

That would be quite novel. Kind of like how Barca had Toure as a CB at times, provided real punch from the back. Dropping Dembele back will provide creativity over the whole pitch, however if that was the case I would rather Holtby/Carroll on the pitch rather than Sandro as they are more effective higher up.

&gt;...Lennon...

I agree with everything you have to say there.

&gt;I'd also like to see us get more wing cover - either someone like Pjanic, or if AVB thinks he's good enough, get Townsend into the team.

Agreed. Give Townsend some time to make it his own, if he can't step up then somewhere on the TODO list needs to be wing upgrades.

I really do think Leandro fucking Damiao is going to be a quality player, but he is tied up with a pain in the ass President and a shit agent.  I believe the 3rd party is already somewhat sorted out to a degree, i remember seeing something about the ownership now basically being Inter and Inter's president, which explains why the price continues to go up when he hasn't done anything to warrant it....the president gets to make a personal profit off the sale.

If i had to guess then Southampton have made a bid and Inter are hoping to drag us back into the fold to drive up the price.  Fortunately if Levy goes back in he will offer them phone cards and nectar points.

I have a tough time seeing Southampton forking up £16m-£21m, they strike me more as a smart spending team who learned from their mistakes of spending too big, to spend that big on a player when they aren't top half of the table is incredibly risky.  But, best of luck in negotiations though

A mixed bag really. Delighted that we would be signing one of the best strikers in the league, but wary that he will bring a lot of bad press with him. I also think £40M would be a lot of money for one player, and that we could probably put it to better use.

&gt;Do you think it's even possible?

It's possible, we do after all have the assets for the transfer and if Suarez is as unsettled at Liverpool as he is rumoured to be then maybe he will hand in a transfer request to try and facilitate the deal. 

I would say it's highly unlikely though. Mostly because of the sum of money in question which is so far above Arsenal's previous ceiling, but also because I'm nearly certain that Suarez would rather leave the UK than move from Liverpool to another PL club. 

&gt;do you agree with me that Suarez would still probably get a more sympathetic treatment there than he does at Liverpool?

Yes I think he would. I see that Liverpool gets a lot of stick in the media, and whilst Arsenal aren't exactly the media's darling like the Man Utd's and Tottenham's of this world, we do have a much better record of avoiding ire from newspapers. 

I think our insular approach to publicity and relatively well-respected reputation would help to dampen some of the criticisms that would be thrown in Suarez's direction. That said, the media are clearly driving an agenda against Suarez (some of it justified) so whose to say they would drop their campaign because of a club change. 

My turn to ask questions :) 

* How would you feel about Suarez leaving for Arsenal? 
* Can you see this happening realistically? 
* If Suarez does leave, would you bring in a replacement? If so, who?

Lloris

Walker - Kaboul - Vertonghen - Rose

Paulinho - Sandro - Dembele

Lennon - *Villa* - Bale


**Off the bench/Tactics shake up**

Holtby on for Paulinho/Dembele - same formation, but Holtby is a different sort of player, so the opportunity to change a little without risking too much is there.

Sigurdsson on for Paulinho/Dembele/Sandro - switch to 4-2-3-1 with Bale/Sigurdsson in the hole behind *Villa* (even though I think Bale is greatly wasted here)

Other switch that would cause a tactical shake up/potential nightmares for oppositions is switching Bale/Villa, just shakes things up a little. Also Vertonghen/Kaboul at full back can be devastating. And don't forget Townsend's ability to have a quick impact.


**Players to thrive in this formation**

To be completely honest, whichever midfield 3 is fielded will all greatly benefit, as they'll have cover for their weak areas from the other two, and they'll be able to focus more on their strengths. goes for Paulinho, Sandro, Dembele, Holtby, Carroll^inamorelimitedrole 
Also Bale thrives on the left wing when Paulinho + Dembele start to show greater creative spark than last season.

**Players to struggle**

Lennon. I absolutely love the little man, and I wouldn't sell him for anything that any team in the world would be willing to pay. This formation is not for him. This formation suits Gio dos Santos, whom I wish we still had. He's just not the attacking winger that we hoped he would be. He is a right midfielder, not a winger. For Lennon to strive he really needs to be played in a 4-4-2. His lack of ability to cut into the box/provide second striker presence when Bale is crossing is the problem. Hopefully having Townsend as an option off the bench will prove as a good replacement in games where Lennon is struggling with impact.
Other players that struggle in this formation are Defoe, Sigurdsson &amp; Dempsey. Siggy showed moments where he can play on the wing last season, but nothing that really suggests he could seriously hold down the position. Wasted as a winger.

Nowhere in the article is any evidence whatsoever provided by the author that this bug was installed by any private contractor let alone the named company it links to it.

People can (and do) end up in prison for not paying tax (although active evasion is the most likely cause of prison... you'll probably just get fined a shit ton and have it deducted from your pay before it even makes it to your bank)

If you're paid £32,000 in your full time job your tax rate is 20%, however £32,000 is very close to the next band (£35,000, 40%) so what would happen is the following, assuming £500 per month which is £6000 per year: 

The first £3,000 will take you to the top of the tax band you're in, so you'll pay 20% on £3000 which is £600, then you'll be in the next band (£35,000 to £150,000, 40%) which means the next £3000 is taxed at 40% which is £1200, total deductions on the £6000 is £2000, take home £4000.

However as a self employed person you can expense things. If for example you're doing tech support in peoples houses you can expense the cost of your travel and a portion of your car expenses (relative to the amount of usage) and if you're working from home you can offset your rent / mortgage costs (again, relative to the amount of work vs. home usage).

true,BenlovesBud,eng-hampshire,bristol,"on the topic of the harder drugs, look at it like this. People who want to use heroin, are going to use heroin, whether that means going to a safe vendor, and purchasing high quality heroin, or going to some shady guy in a block of flats and buying some cheap, unregulated heroin that could have come from anywhere.

Also, as i touched upon, if you could regulate the market, and have thorough checks, you could really im prove the quality of stuff being used. Who knows what shit they put into street drugs to bump up the weight, and it doesn't matter to the user. But if you could regulate that, you could increase the quality, and make sure as few impurites are in there as possible, improving the safety of it somewhat. 

Again, look at how well our current system of prohibition works. If you live in a city, it's incredibly easy to get cocaine for example. So the idea of keeping these substances out of public hands is impossible, you are never going to stop it. So instead of working against it, work with it. By doing so, not only are you making a healthier system for all users, but you are taking money away from organised crime, and giving it to our society, which is always a good thing.

At the end of the day, humans, as a species, like taking mind altering substances. We all do it, whether it's getting your fix of caffeine from coffee in the morning, having a drink in the evening or taking ecstasy and going out clubbing. So as a culture, we need to accept that everyone likes taking drugs, and we cannot stop other people from doing so, and work together instead of alienating the ""bad"" drug users from the rest of the drug taking culture of humanity.

A 2004 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report said: ""The United States is among the few industrialized nations in the world that does not guarantee access to health care for its population."" A 2004 OECD report said: ""With the exception of Mexico, Turkey, and the United States, all OECD countries had achieved universal or near-universal (at least 98.4% insured) coverage of their populations by 1990."" A 2010 report observed that lack of health insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States.[2] In 2007, 62.1% of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses. A 2013 study found that about 25% of all senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses, and 43% are forced to mortgage or sell their primary residence.

A study of international health care spending levels published in the health policy journal Health Affairs in the year 2000 conclude that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. than elsewhere.

Edited to add more information below:

A 2007 survey had found about 70 million Americans either have difficulty paying for medical treatment or have medical debt.[3] Studies have found people are most likely to accumulate large medical debts when they do not have health insurance to cover the costs of necessary medications, treatments, or procedures – in 2009 about 50 million Americans had no health coverage.[2] However, about 60% of those found to have medical debt were insured.[3] Health insurance plans rarely cover any and all health-related expenses; for insured people, the gap between insurance coverage and the affordability of health care manifests as medical debt. As with any type of debt, medical debt can lead to an array of personal and financial problems - including having to go without food and heat plus a reluctance to seek further medical treatment.[3] [4] Aggressive debt collecting has been highlighted as an aggravating factor.[5] A study has found about 63% of adults with medical debt avoided further medical treatment, compared with only 19% of adults who had no such debt.[6]",0,1372945109,null,0,1372945687,0,cavth69,t3_1hkpr9,t1_cavth69,t1_cavtdbw,null,1430586131,3,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,3

Why was this a good thing, though?

People talk about owning a home as *obviously* a good thing, like its something that doesn't even need explaining - I don't know that I've ever seen anyone give reasons for saying ""people should own their own homes"". 

There's perhaps some prestige in owning a home rather than living in a council house, but what's really important to people is not actually *owning* their home, it's having a *secure* home - the emotional security of knowing you're not going to be thrown out in the street because you've lost your job or at a landlord's whim.

In Thatcher's day council houses had long been a very secure tenancy. In many ways living in a council house was better than owning your own home - it was certainly more secure than having a mortgage, for example.

And this is not to say that ""we were all supporting them"" - at one time in the 70s a whole third of the population lived in council houses [[cite](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0109dvs)], factory and office workers, policemen, nurses and teachers *far* outnumbering the unemployed who were their neighbours.

&gt; in theory, the government could spend the money it gained on selling old houses on building newer houses

The council house sell off was part of a deliberate ideology that the government had no place in building houses.

One of the Thatcher-Reagan neoliberal beliefs was that the government building houses was a ""socialist"" thing to do (when half the developed world were our communist enemy) and that it was ""less bureaucratic"" and ""more efficient"" if house-building was left to private developers. 

Please don't ever say ""the council house sell off would have been good if the money had been reinvested into building replacements"" because it would probably never have happened that way!

What is MotoGoLoco?
In it's simplest form, we're a directory of GENUINELY motorcycle friendly accommodation throughout the UK &amp; Ireland.

""And?! Nothing particularly ground-breaking there..."" I hear you mutter, so please allow me to fill you in on a bit of that 'And'.

The Problem
We all know the problems and pitfalls when looking for somewhere to stay when travelling by bike:

""How will they react when I arrive on my bike?""
""What about all my (normally soaking wet) kit?""
""Are they used to having people arrive on bikes – will I be looked down on or made to feel unwelcome?""
""What about my bike? Will it be somewhere safe overnight?""
""Am I going to be treated like a hells angel? Is that what they expect me to be like?""

So how can we be so sure that the places we recommend are any better?

We’ve checked them all out, personally.  Every single hotel, B&amp;B and campsite that you see listed on MotoGoLoco is visited, checked and endorsed by one of us, in person.  Our ‘discovered, visited &amp; endorsed’ stamp of approval is our personal guarantee that the place you’re looking at is somewhere we would genuinely recommend to a biker.

I think that just about covers the (very) basics - hopefully I've not trodden on anybody's toes by posting, if so I do apologise.

Everyone pays a fixed price for dental care well below what it costs to have the procedure. You don't have to pay if you are [exempt](http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1786.aspx?categoryid=74&amp;subcategoryid=742). 

Prescriptions - Again a fixed cost for a prescription of £7.85, whatever it costs. Again there is a long list of [exemptions](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcosts/Pages/Prescriptioncosts.aspx). Still heavily subsidised by the NHS. Also some prescriptions you never have to pay for like contraceptives &amp; medication for TB.

Medical research - Not all funded through the NHS but government funded through MRC (Medical research council), some research funded through the NHS. Been trying to find an accurate annual figure for research spending probably are £950million per annum. Hard to distinguish between medical and non medical scientific spending from a quick look.

The FDA - The FDA has no jurisdiction in anywhere but the USA. The UK equivalent is [NICE](http://www.nice.org.uk/mpc/index.jsp) (National institute for healthcare excellence) which regulates drugs used in the UK and determines if drugs are safe and effective.

Medications not available - The NHS only funds treatment that is both safe and effective and has been proven so. If the NHS doesn't fund it it means it doesn't work very well or has horrific side effects that outweigh the benefits. Occasionally it's because NICE wants another study done before it's happy the drug is both safe and effective. The NHS doesn't fund false hope. 

Massages - Why should the NHS cover massages on their own? It covers physiotherapy to make you better and sometimes that covers massages if you need it as part of your physio. Massages on demand may make people feel good but isn't a medical treatment so the NHS shouldn't fund it.

Viagra - You can get treatment for [erectile disfunction on the NHS](http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/882.aspx?CategoryID=61&amp;SubCategoryID=612) if it's associated with another condition like diabetes or MS or after certain procedures like the removal of the prostate. You can also get it if you are prescribed it by a specialist if ED is causing you what is termed 'extreem distress'.

true,FootballMythbusters,null,null,"On Mkhitaryan specifically:

&gt;Backed by one of the top 50 wealthiest individuals in the world, Rinat Akhmetov, Shakhtar Donetsk are never under pressure to sell their prime assets. This may also partly explain why Liverpool's pursuit of Shakhtar's wonderful attacking midfielder, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, is likely to turn into one of the transfer sagas of the summer. Though Liverpool's interest has never been confirmed by either club (or the player), there's said to have been contact at an official level. If, as is claimed, the player's transfer rights are partly owned by two other parties (in addition to the stake held by Shakhtar) this would probably complicate matters even further.

&gt;Having wisely acted early in this summer's market with the signing of a series of players that look somewhere at the crossroads of future promise (Luis Alberto) and valuable squad additions (Simon Mignolet, Iago Aspas and Kolo Touré), the Anfield club still lacks the marquee signing that may help boost their Champions League aspirations – especially as Luis Suárez's future remains unclear.

&gt;As with Paulinho to Spurs, a player of Mkhitaryan's calibre joining a club outside the Champions League would have been unthinkable in a prosperous European football scene in which genuine spending power on the continent extended beyond a meagre dozen clubs.

&gt;I've still to come across a chief scout or sporting director from European clubs of a certain standard that has not placed Mkhitaryan very near the top of his summer wish list, but £20m plus for one player is proving hard to cough up on the continent these days.

&gt;The 24-year-old Armenian is blessed with a somewhat unconventional playing style. Though usually deployed rather deep in his attacking midfield role his quick feet, positional awareness and ability to exploit spaces and successfully execute actions in a snap second make him extremely hard to predict – and a lot more ""concrete"" and direct than the typical attacking midfielder. Add to that a high goal-scoring rate through the capability of finishing immaculately with both feet, as well as setting up his team-mates with an accurate killer pass, and Mkhitaryan could turn into a genuine Premier League hit.",0,1372950896,null,0,false,0,cavuvmm,t3_1hmxnk,t1_cavuvmm,t3_1hmxnk,null,1430585396,13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,13

That's going to have to be one incredibly inefficient home before it makes up the difference of the sheer quantity of money that is being given away by selling them.

Incidentally, what typically happens with many right-to-buy houses is that the ex-tenant cashes in their windfall of a cheap house by selling it very soon after buying it.  It gets sold to private landlords, who the government then rents it back off to put a social tenant back in.  Therefore government selling off social housing just ends up with them paying higher running costs for the very thing they used to own.

Depends on your definition of healthcare and your definition of poverty. $250 for an X-ray to discover the source of your persistent back pain is not, in the grand scheme of things, a lot of money. But when you're working on minimum wage, your car needs fixing or you won't be able to work, and this is an unplanned expense, it's a lot harder to find the money. It's not about people in poverty, it's about the vast majority of people who are on a relatively low, but perfectly livable wage.

&gt;How would you feel about Suarez leaving for Arsenal?

I've mixed thoughts on him leaving. He is under a spotlight that no other player is. Shortly after his biting incident, Fellaini elbowed three Liverpool players in the derby match. The commentators on the stream I was watching were outraged, and it was the main thing they talked about at half time, but it didn't even come up on MOTD. Like Suarez's bite, nobody was hurt and the game wasn't affected, but if Suarez had done it it would have been trending on Twitter, which is apparently grounds for a 10 match ban. Suarez is a ticking time-bomb for reasons that are only partly of his own making, and if we could sell him at a big profit we probably should (as long as the money is spent on similarly high-calibre replacements).

Selling him to Arsenal is a different story. Liverpool fans would like to think that we are competing with Spurs and Arsenal for that greatest trophy in all of football, fourth place in the Premier League. Losing our best players to Barcelona and Madrid is something we're used to. Torres to Chelsea worked out OK, but only because we'd already squeezed all the juice of him and sold them a husk. Suarez to Arsenal would be rather painful, unless he managed to get himself a lifetime ban on his debut and then serious lulz.

Most former Liverpool players get a genuine welcome when they return to Anfield but if Suarez leaves this summer he'll be about as welcome as Gary Neville.

&gt;Can you see this happening realistically?

From our end, I can see the pragmatic decision being to get rid. If he brings in £40m+ that's a handsome profit. I don't think the people running the club now are afflicted with the kind of sentimentality that's dogged us recently, and are more likely to see him as a PR liability.

I'd really be more surprised if Arsenal were to splash that amount of cash. I've mentioned elsewhere in this thread that a swap deal seems more likely than an outright purchase.


&gt;If Suarez does leave, would you bring in a replacement? If so, who?

As I said elsewhere, a swap deal involving Walcott strikes me as more likely than an outright purchase. Our transfer activity seems to have focused on the 'versatile midfielder/forward' side of things (assuming Mkhitaryan is on the way), so I don't think we'd necessarily be looking at like for like. Suarez's departure might leave us short of an accomplished finisher, and I'd like to see an experienced player in that position at the club to help the young players learn as much as anything (we have 'institutional memory' in defence and midfield, but not up front, and it shows in some of our naive forward play). David Villa springs to mind there.

But we desperately need to strengthen the defence with at least two signings (full-backs or central depending on where Kelly and Wisdom will end up in the long term). My fantasy signing is a controversial shout, but with mixed messages about whether David Luiz is wanted at Chelsea I'd love to sign him, and play a 3-5-2 with an all-Brazilian spine of Luiz, Lucas and Coutinho.",0,1372951965,null,0,false,0,cavv6ro,t3_1hmk10,t1_cavv6ro,t1_cavsvtr,null,1430585251,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

I'm surprised they were annoyed you already had a job - did they look at your CV? 

The only thing I can guess is that they wanted to speak to you about contract roles and were annoyed that you probably have a 1 month notice period or similar - so wouldn't be eligible for contract work which generally requires an immediate start...

The best thing I can think of is to put in red font at the top of your CV *what kind of thing you're looking for as well as some information about your current situation*. Include your notice period, the kind of work you'll consider and the skills you are looking to work with. Don't include salary expectations though - just a bracket of expectations (£30-40k, rather than ""I am currently on £29,000""). 

Alternatively do some research into local media agencies and approach them directly? More leg work but you retain total control.

Since it's my job, if you'd like to send your details to me then I'll pass them on to my colleagues with a caveat of the kind of thing you're looking for - but this is Reddit and not Jobsite so if you'd rather not - that's fine :)",0,1372952226,null,0,false,0,cavv9k4,t3_1hmrtp,t1_cavv9k4,t1_cavv3og,null,1430585214,2,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,2

Agreed. I don't see why at this point in time he'd rather be at Arsenal than Liverpool, but maybe he's being pushed out by the club?

I always thought it would be cool if the Doctor went back to WW2 (and for once not in London). To stop a soldier who had seen and done too much and was going insane with power when his company gets cut off.

The Doctor stops him by making him forget the killing he'd witnessed and taken part in. At this point the Doctor learns that the man is a young Sergeant Mott. In ""The End of Time"" it's talked about how Mott never killed anyone in battle and that he keeps meeting the Doctor. This would expand on that if the Doctor was the reason why he got to go on with his life never knowing what he'd done. So. Bittersweet?

EDIT: Maybe the Doctor learns that the Sergeant is so far gone that he has to kill him but can't once he learns who he is. Maybe it ends with the Doctor taking Mott out to see the stars but takes those memories away. That explains why Wilfred is so fascinated with the telescope later in life. Small traces of those lost memories.

Luiz -I don't subscribe to the 'Luiz for midfield' school of thought. He is a natural defender and I think that is where Jose will play him. Furthermore, with Terry on the decline his leadership is too badly needed at the back to be counted on to fill squad gaps in the midfield.

Romeu-Was coming on well last season, but it is yet to be seen how well he'll recover from such a serious injury and long lay off, especially at such a young age. Hopefully not a case of deja vu ala Essien.

Aké- Talented to be  sure, but hardly ready to hold down a starting spot in our midfield. Made only 6 appearances last year, and even those were mostly due to the desperate need to rotate the squad to combat massive fixture pile up.

Chalobah- Again, extremely talented however I would expect him to go out on loan again, with a premier league club this time. He's not ready to start for Chelsea at the highest level.

Essien- More of a sqaud utility player these days than a top choice midfielder. Mourinho used him all over the pitch at Real Madrid last year, in particular making a number of high profile starts at right back in the Champions League. I can only imagine that Jose will utilize him in a similar 'jack of all trades' capacity at Chelsea next season.

Oscar-Hasn't shown me anything in the past season to suggest that he is suited to a deeper-lying CM role. Has looked his best in an advanced AM position either just behind the striker or on the wings. Each time he has moved deeper for a short period towards the end of games, I have been supremely unconvinced. I know he has played well there for Brazil on occasion in the past, but the Premier League is a totally different animal and it takes an entirely different type of physicality to cut it in the center of the park. A physicality that, I'm afraid, I don't really see in our little Brazilian.

van Ginkel- ??? Will he stay, or will he go? Again, looks like an extremely talented young prospect, but we're still not sure what the immediate future holds. If he stays we'll see if he can cut it in the Premier League week in, week out. However, I would be far from surprised if he ended up spending the season on loan somewhere.

**TL;DR**
The lack of quality in depth at central midfield is real. This has been the weakest part of our squad over the last two years, imo. Signing an established, or at least semi-established, well-rounded CM player should be a top priority. We really missed out when Levy refused to sell us Modric.

true,TheGingerLow,EN,england,"You're entitled to your opinion and all but I don't think Luiz is as good in defence as he is in midfield. He loves to go forward and so I really don't feel comfortable with him in defence. I know he CAN defend, which is why I think the holding midfield position is perfect for him. No way is he being wasted in midfield (look at his performances when he plays there).

Ramires is a solid tackler (not afraid of going for it). He's also very pacey and a good dribbler. Yes his first touch can be iffy but his pros outweigh the cons.

Mikel is very good in the holding position. Very underrated. Wins the ball back a lot for us, distributes the ball well (as does Luiz) and can go forward as shown by his performances for Nigeria.

We also have Essien lets not forget. Ok he isn't what he used to be but a solid back up choice. As is Lampard.

Romeu showed under AVB that he can play well in that position.

Ake and Chalobah are two promising youngsters that can play CB or CM. You say they ""aren't ready"" but then if we keep buying new players then they never will be. Then they'll be a waste of promising potential.

So yes, ""really"". We don't need this Dutch fellow. I'm sure he's a talented player but we simply do not need him.

&gt; Our prison system - Shit, yes, but not quite as bad I would *personally* argue (my opinions, please note). Their system is a business, they have absolutely no motivation for less prisoners, as prisoners make *money*. Prisons are factories, they make profit. I remember an episode of QI where it was stated 50% of Americas home appliances are made by prisoners. I would even go as far as say that their legal system is made to keep prison rates high, to keep pockets of the rich full.  

&gt; Our Police - A bit shit, too bogged down in bureaucracy and budget restraints, and the occasional underhand deals from papers, but nothing *inherently* corrupt.

&gt; Our Government - Shit. *But* at least we have a system where it is possible to have a 3rd party. Theirs is fucking mental. They spend BILLIONS on campaigns for candidacy. Its fucking mental. While we have a rather modest in comparison cap of around 50 mil I believe.

&gt; Our foreign policies/Image - Shit and miraculously getting shittier. Yeah pretty much this, slightly less bad in comparison maybe.

true,showmethefever,flair8,,"The 4-3-3 seems ideal for including Sandro, Dembele and Paulinho all at once, but I can't get past the compromise it forces upon other players. One thing I like about the 4-2-3-1 is that it allows Bale to easily switch roles across LM, CAM and RM, while whoever is playing from Lennon, Siggy, Holtby and Dempsey adjust. It really makes Bale hard to keep track of and gives him more creativity, while allowing the other players more space and freedom. In a 4-3-3, we would have to have mobile forward who could slip out to the wing in order for that to work, so David Villa would have to be a primary target. 

My preferred signings would be Villa and Gomez for around a combined 25m, where we make up that extra 5m in selling either Defoe or Ade, and staying in the 4-2-3-1 for at least another year. AVB could phase in the 4-3-3 over the year if that's the direction he wants to go. As awesome of a midfield the previous trio would be, we still have to see how fit Sandro will be and remember that Dembele is quite prone to minor injuries. This way we have plenty of depth and still allow for Siggy and Holtby to get plenty of the playing time that they need and deserve.

Rumored bid. £12.5M.

**Cons**: Too similar to Schneiderlin, possibly. Slowest and gets caught in possession often.

The council has not been good at dealing with it. They have done trials in some places, gull proof bags and the like, but are taking forever to get around to implementing solutions widely. On top of that, the bin men come at times which might or might not be pretty regular for the job but it is a window of a few hours so even if you leave it late to put the bags out there is plenty of time for the gulls. 

They do not have the on-street large bins everywhere as it is not always practical and the council allege that there are issues with much of the city being World Heritage Site. Probably also some bureaucratic nonsense about trying to minimise rubbish as the EU is now giving out big fines for tipping rubbish above targets.

Other significant reasons include locals and tourists being messy bastards, and the bin provision is woefully inadequate in tourist spots during the festivals.

true,MoarLazers,,Furness,"I'm a second year in CS (going into third year this summer), they started a new course last year and it's pretty varied.

Last year we had four modules in the major CS:

* Software Development:

This is mostly Java but you'll do a little C and Scratch in the first five weeks, you don't really need to be familiar but a little knowledge never hurt anyone.

* Fundamentals of Computer Science:

This mainly explains algorithms, data structures etc. If you did A-level decision maths this is just a re-run.

* Information Systems:

This is the biggest load of bullshit you'll ever be presented with.

* Digital Systems:

The hardest module by a really long way. You'll cover machine instructions, binary, MIPS, some hardware and you'll do a little C towards the end of the year. The guy who runs this module (Andrew Scott) is the guy who created Microsoft's mobile IPv6 framework. He expects you to get up to his level.


All in all the course is alright, if you do straight CS instead of a minor there are a couple of other modules that are apparently not worth doing, so I recommend choosing a minor subject that interests you a little.
