In the ""Science of Doctor Who"" special, he said that he thought the main draw to DW was the phrase ""It's bigger on the inside."" No. Dumb. Bad show runner. That's a stupid little one-liner that makes people sorta chuckle. Just like characters constatnly repeating the title of the show. I realize it was probaby taken out of context and a joke, but no one who understands DW could say that.

Dr. Who is about the characters. It's about ordinary people living ordinary lives being thrust into extraordinary circumstances and still prevailing as themselves. It's about showing a world where what we call ""humanity"" is larger than humanity. 

Nothing before Moffat had such insanely over-arching plot arcs. Even the Bad Wolf thing was subtle. And it didn't drive the plot except in those two moments: the coincidence joke and Rose's realization. 

The evolution of Torchwood over the years was a little less subtle, but it still never drove the plot for an entire season (or, god forbid, two). The closest thing I can think of was little things like YANA and knocking 4 times. But they weren't as heavy-handed and thoughtless as ""holy crap, this is a crack in reality, so I'm going to spend an entire season worrying about it and pointing it out every chance I get, then I'll joke about it 2 seasons later for no reason"". 

I really like Clara. I think that setup, that actress, that character has the potential to be the best companion since Rose. But it won't happen under Moffat. 

This season is boring because Moffat has forgotten what makes Doctor Who special. And I never expected that. He wrote some *awesome* episodes (Silence/Forest, Blink, The Girl in the Fireplace, Empty Child/Doctor Dances). They were absolutely briliant. All of them are on my list of favorite episodes. They all had something special about them, and they all felt like Doctor Who.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"That phrase can mean a couple of different things (which is why government likes using it). One aspect in which it's undoubtedly true is how much money you get to keep when you have the opportunity of piece-meal work while claiming JSA. At the moment, you lose the same amount in benefits as you gain in wages, at least up to the JSA limit of £55 a week. 

Say you lost your job as a builder. You could be sending leaflets round for odd jobs. In the long run there might be a small business there, but in the short term you're spending time and effort with no reward, you have to go through incredible amounts of bureaucracy, and you might even risk losing JSA entirely (with an income which might fail the next week).

You might have to do this for multiple benefits, with separate forms, different rules for each, and uncertain outcomes. When there are unclear thresholds, you can't even be sure whether you might lose money in aggregate.

So 'always earn more in work' can mean 'if you earn £50 a week extra, you will get to keep £30 of it'. And only fill in one form, and don't worry about five different sets of rules. That's the basic idea behind a universal credit, and it's an excellent idea, if they can make it work.

true,[deleted],null,null,"A long time ago, someone I love died. Things went horribly wrong and I was left sitting around wondering, mostly, what if. In doing so, I had devolved into this thing that just lived. There was no drive, there was no will, there was nothing. But then a friend of mine introduced me to Doctor Who. 

The first episode he showed me was the second half of the series 4 finale, when Martha comes back with a 'gun'. I was intrigued and downloaded all that I could find. Didn't really care much, just wanted to see it. 

Started off with 9. Watched the first episode and watched another. I had realized then that on CBC (Canadian channel) a few years ago, I had seen the episode with Cassandra and the end of Earth. Episode 2 if I remember correctly. Kept downloading more and more, waking up each day with more episodes to watch. Doctor Who was quite literally the only thing that actually had me excited to wake up in the morning.

Got a bit too involved. Poured my heart and my soul into that show and ended up creating a very strong bond with 10 in particular. You know with all that stuff of him being my first. Kept watching the show faithfully, knowing that 10 was leaving soon but I kept going. I had sort of accepted the pain and dealt with it and was moving on and then 10 died. 

That dealt a pretty big blow. I hadn't dealt with the pain at all, all I did was shift it from one person to another character. I wept when 10 died. Oh god did I weep. I mean, I'm a grown ass man and I had snot pouring down my face. I ended up back in the same funk that I was in when the person I love died. I was going by day to day and I was trying to sort it out but now it was just compacted. Essentially what had happened was the inital problem was a bunch of snow. Then as time went on, the snow started to harden. When 10 died, more snow fell and it all got compacted into ice.

Didn't know what to do. Hated 11 for a long time because of the shift of grief. Honestly, I'm still not a huge fan of 11. Does he do a good job? Yes. Do I like him? Not entirely. Do I still watch it? Of course.

Took me a little bit but I was able to sort it out. Took a lot of alcohol, some home-made therapy but I'm doing considerably better.

Until the past 2 months. I've been under a lot of pressure to find a new place to live. Current landlord is the most vindictive bitch I've ever met in my life and she is straight up abusing her tenants. Found a place on April 11th and the new landlord had said it was mine. New landlord wasn't in town however, she was out of town dealing with some family business. Eventually, on April 26th, she comes into town. 

Now, I've got forms and shit to fill out. I'm not entirely paying the rent on my own at the moment, will be in a month but due to some circumstances I ended up flat on my ass a little while ago, and I needed her to fill out these forms. She immediately regretted telling me that the place was mine, despite her being aware that these forms needed to be filled out. I had to coax her into agreeing and filling out the forms.

She takes the forms and she is going to fax them in as she has to go out of town again and has to stop at a bank first. That's all fine, I'm cool with that. I get written stuff from her saying that the place is mine and she has the forms and is going to fax them in before the 1st. 

Well I called today to check if the forms went through. Apparently they didn't. They ended up getting caught somewhere and they haven't gone through so my current landlord is getting the money that the new landlord was supposed to get. Remember how I said my current landlord is a vindictive bitch? Yeah. She is. She's saying she is entitled to the money due to my breaking the lease. I informed her it was bullshit and she had to give me the money back. I'll get the money back but she is going to make sure it's going to take a long time to get through. 

So I emailed my new landlord and told her what's up. She's hesitant again and I'm stressing out. Hell, even the transportation to bring my stuff from my current house to my new one is falling through so I've got to find a backup for that. I'm stressing out, my heart is racing, I'm freaking out. To make things worse, today is my ex's birthday, tomorrow is MY birthday and I won't be doing anything other than packing and stressing out. 


Yet I take one look at 10, I see this photo and everything feels right again. Whether or not it's healthy, I don't care but with 10 has always come this feeling, to me, that things are going to be okay. It's idiotic, I know, and I must sound like I'm rattling off some drivel but I just needed to get it off my chest. Sorry for the comment, go ahead and downvote it as I'm sure it doesn't quite belong here.

The thing about single episode characters is that they need to be much larger than life because there isn't time for lots of development or exposition.

It involves spending some money, getting proper engineers and designers who know something about cycling and not putting motor vehicles as #1.  Better cycling facilities and public transport, make the alternatives to driving much better.

Even where there aren't many cycle lanes in Holland (throw the orange man down in Google Maps, it's hard not to see cycle paths) because so many people cycle, the drivers aren't as aggressive.  No tailgating, swearing or punishment passes.  They pay attention, they overtake when safe etc and this shows in their accident statistic.

Over here, if you take the lane so you don't get doored or take it so a car can't squeeze past, it only takes a few moments before someone decides to be aggressive.

true,patrick888,null,null,"&gt; Also if you go to Dubai you are reaping the benefits of save labour. There are lots of Indian guest workers who are promised a certain wage for when they arrive. Then when they get there they have their passports taken and told they will only be getting a quarter of that.

That doesn't really happen, at least, not to a significant extent. If it did, do you really think thousands of Indian labourers would come back to Dubai year after year?

You quote from Johan Hari but that article is nonsense. It is entertainingly written but anyone who lives here or has a reasonable amount of experience with the emirate can see it is wrong. Of course Dubai has its problems, like anywhere, but this was written only to generate a reaction, not provide balanced journalism. Here are just a few of the obvious fallacies:

* He says there are cactuses in the desert. However these only grow in the Americas and are not found in Dubai.
* He says he sees the Sheikh's smiling face plastered on every other building but there are only a few posters of him in the whole city (and he is never smiling) - Hari was probably getting confused with adverts.
* He says workers aren't given breaks in the heat. All the construction sites I have worked on close between 12 and 3 in the summer.
* Every worker speaks like him. Putting words into their mouths?

I could go on. The whole tone of the article is geared up to generate outrage whilst ignoring the subtleties, just like a Daily Mail article. I am sure he could write a great novel, but as a journalist he needs to be more factual and less emotive.

It is a shame because he could have made some valid points but ruined it by going completely over the top and even making stuff up. That seems to be the guy's style though as he has subsequently been discredited for habitually falsifying information:

He would probably be best suited to play the playmaker slot but much deeper than you would with Holtby or Carroll.

In a 4-2-3-1 i think he is a better fit providing playmaking from deep with a midfield destroyer along side him with one or two creative mids ahead of him, this pulls Bale and Lennon back a bit deeper which isn't ideal to the attack but still workable.

&gt;Why would you have a kid if you didn't have a good job? And even if you did have a good job, what sort of idiot doesn't take out income protection insurance, to make sure they have a decent income while not working?

Some of us have had good jobs, raised a family on fairly low wage, and then been made redundant. Income protection is paid for through my taxes on low wages, its called ""out of work benefits"" and if you work and pay your stamp, you have access to this unbelievable low cost protection. Your not paying for someone else, your paying for yourself. The cost is shared across all of us, even those on the bare minimum of benefits.

In common with many other providers we contacted, VyprVPN acknowledged receipt of our questions but then failed to respond. We’ve included them here since they have such a high-profile.

We maintain this level of information on a per-session basis for at least 90 days.”

&gt;On Usenet forum NZBMatrix several users have reported having their VyprVPN service terminated after the company processed “a backlog” of DMCA notices which pushed them over the “two-strikes-and-out” acceptable use policy.

I can honestly say that I've never been in a relationship with someone that was unhappy with the idea of abortion and in fact, I can't think of anyone in my social circle that is unhappy with the idea (although I can accept that one's social circle is largely self-selecting).

Personally, unwillingness to contemplate an abortion has historically been a red line for me when it comes to relationships and it's a conversation that I've always had very early on in a relationship.

Pregnancy is a natural consequence of sexual relations and I - personally speaking - could never be in any sort of relationship with someone who was happy to have a sexual relationship with me but unhappy to discuss the potential consequences, and that extends to things like STD/STI status as well as attitudes towards unwanted pregnancy.

Yes mistakes and accidents can happen, but I just can't reconcile the idea of freely engaging in sexual activity and not being prepared for the consequences.

I know the usual lot who hear the word 'Loyalist' automatically assume absolute idiocy - and in many cases you'd be correct. The PUP, however, are not idiots and aren't to be pushed around either. They've taken a lot of shit the last few months and have responded well in the media to it by taking some form of diplomatic approach to it all. 

**--BIG FLAG PROTESTS--**

During the flag protests they took the side of the pro-flag crowd but were also one of the first to condemn any form of violence around about the same time Jim Allister (TUV) made a similar speech in Stormont. 

This got a lot of young people interested in politics as the PUP used the big stage to promote their brand of politics. Disillusioned, working class, young Protestant people saw that the PUP's policy was actually looking out for working class people and empowering the will of the people. Now whether or not you agree with their party politics is completely your choice - personally I disagree with them on many levels - but you cannot deny they are a new brand of politics to those who didn't know anything outside the letters DUP &amp; UUP. 

**--LESS FLAG PROTESTS--**

As the flag protests came to a steady decline the PUP didn't take the same route as the Protestant Forums of Bryson and co. and instead kept themselves very quiet about the whole affair. Instead they continued to push for new members and people to get involved in their local community. 

This was their big separation from other PUL voices. They didn't want to be identified with the likes of Bryson and Fraser from the start and instead wanted to be taken seriously by the people of Northern Ireland. They knew that by not radically changing the image of the party from a left-wing Loyalist party to a Union Flag Loyalist party they could still maintain their image while having a new membership base.

How they handled themselves between the end of the protests and now is very important as well.

**--NO MORE PROTESTS--**

So there is no more protests and the PUP are still hammering away in the local media. Now we start to see they are just a party who are trying to revive themselves but are acting as a true voice of opposition. They are calling the DUP and UUP out on their representation of working class Protestants and do it effectively. They start to get more and more active as the weeks go on in their communities and putting their name out there.

The most important thing but, in my opinion, is that they have a real link between the higher and lower tiers of the party. They educate their members - especially young people - on the history of Northern Ireland, the current state of affairs and now the PUP aim to change that. This is a distinct difference from how the DUP and UUP treat their young members - which is a guaranteed membership fee and a guaranteed vote. 

Educating their young members and setting up new youth wings across Northern Ireland has been effective in that their members can actually call out themselves the flaws of the current establishment and I have actually found myself agreeing with new members of the PUP on certain issues - while also having educated debates with them on things we would disagree with. This is something I couldn't do with these people initially I'd say - or at least to the same degree.

**--THE GRAND SCHEME--**

The PUP have come out of this as a far more legitimate political party than they went in. The flag protests has really opened up a market that they have been chipping away at for years and years - especially since the death of Ervine. They used it to their advantage to get their message across and now membership has shot through the roof.

Now that they are engaging with Republicans they are also seen as a party who want to see NI move on from the dark old days. They have a good image of themselves in the media now that this story is out and it can only get better from here if Hutchinson and Co. continue to play their cards right. 

**--MY PREDICTIONS--**

The PUP will continue to grow in popularity and before long the UVF of East Belfast will be kicked out from the 'mainstream' UVF. This will end the PUPs links with the UVF - they need something to happen to get rid of those links and I think this will be it. It may take a few months or so but it will happen within the next 12 - 18 months I think. 

In turn the PUP will poll well in areas like Belfast East, Belfast North, North Down &amp; Ards where a lot of working class Protestants (especially young people) will, quite possibly for the first time ever, go out and vote in large numbers in opposition to the current establishment.

I don't like the PUP and their views but they've played their cards well over the last few months and in the politics game that's what you have to do if you want to come out on top of your game.

But most roads aren't like that. When I think about towns and cities I know reasonably well, they have almost no roads which would be wide enough for a cycle path. Certainly not enough to create a useful network.

I suppose one possibility would be to steal one lane of the road and make it a one way street. One lane for cars (one direction only) the other for cycles (both directions).

That actually wouldn't cost very much at all, you wouldn't necessarily need a barrier. It would create serious pain for motorists - one way systems are horrible. This is probably the sort of difficult decision Holland would take, but the UK would really struggle.

Although of course many towns have introduced one way systems to create extra parking spaces, motorists just about put up with that.",0,1367274445,null,0,false,0,c9p77f6,t3_1dbtyi,t1_c9p77f6,t1_c9p68bz,null,1431380669,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Especially with Moussa being substituted, this meant that Scotty was forced forward and had to make those runs which Moussa usually does, while Scotty just dribbled his way into trouble.

So with Lewis and Scotty last game, together, in that forward 2 you placed as a midfield, they didn't work well. As two players who run all over the place, they were often caught out of position while defending, and we were caught without width, as Gareth and Clint had to compensate while having to come and get the ball, since Scott and Lewis were out of tune.

Similarly, Tom's long balls through, although good, meant that we were caught high up the pitch with little width and support.

I feel like what you have there would do well, because Scott is more mobile in that Anchor role, with NO ATTACKING RESPONSIBILITY, whilst Moussa and Lewis can dictate the attacking through the centre, and can be relied upon to distribute wide.",0,1367279229,null,0,false,0,c9p8wl4,t3_1dd4a2,t1_c9p8wl4,t1_c9p7oe0,null,1431379796,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

The problem is that Sky Sports is the same cost on any provider, I think Sky got in trouble for selling Sky Sports at higher rates to competitors. So whatever the cheapest basic package is for any provider will probably be the cheapest inclusive of Sky Sports, you'll just have to add ~£20 or whatever the added cost is.

The huge advantage of Sky for me is that my parents have multiroom, which I use whilst at University, so I have Sky Sports streamed through my Xbox in my halls room, which is a godsend. 

I'm a bit confused as to how it's going to work next season, as from what I've heard, BT don't have to sell Sky their packages, but Sky Sports will be available on BT, so the only way to get the full Premier League package might be BT Vision with Sky Sports added on, but don't take that as gospel.

The Competition Commission have really made a mess of it, we were better off with Sky having all the games.

* Sexy chose him, a TARDIS recognizing something like her, something that was lost and broken like she was.
* In the last days of the war there was madness. There was the Could-Have-Been-King and his army of never-wheres and may-have-beens (something like that). It's completely plausible that intangible things (like TARDIS energy) would be made tangible... hence his birth into mortal flesh 
* He ran away from the time lords and from the war because he was new and not used to being alive yet
* In this last episode we saw that part of what a Tardis can do is make machinery. The Doctor has a sonic screwdriver but it's just a screwdriver. If you can talk and interact with machinery though I'm sure it's a lot more effective.
* He doesn't know how old he is. How could he? It'd be awfully hard to put down dates on this sort of thing.
* Interesting to notice the progression to being insane in 9-10-11.

CSKA to offer Honda extended deal
Kyodo
MOSCOW — CSKA Moscow will begin talks with Japan midfielder Keisuke Honda about a contract extension through the summer of 2015, a Russian website reported on Thursday.

Honda's existing deal with the Russian Premier League leaders expires at the end of next year. According to sports.ru, citing Honda's agent, the 2010 World Cup star is happy at CSKA and will not rule out extending his contract.

The report, however, also sources CSKA as saying that Honda wants to play for a big European club and that it will not stand in the way of the 26-year-old.""",0,1367284748,null,0,false,0,c9pav5s,t3_1dd90h,t1_c9pav5s,t3_1dd90h,null,1431378872,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

He gets the ball and attacks, but he very rarely loses the ball (unless he is taking a shot at crossing).  It's really important for us, given how advanced our FBs get, that we keep possession in those areas.

**BUT**

A key thing to keep in mind about Henderson is he is rarely unfit, last season he played more minutes than anyone else in the team, *and* he was playing out of position.  

I think this year he has definitely grown up, grown more comfortable at Anfield, and realized that he has skills.  His confidence is up, his goal-scoring is up (just had his first multi goal game against Newcastle), and he seems to be enjoying all of it.  No one runs more than Hendo.

I've never really met anyone who felt the same way about Who that I did. The show and Tennant's doctor in particular has helped me get through some pretty rough emotional situations over the years. Whenever I seem to be going through something I'll usually watch some of my favorite episodes like The Girl in the Fireplace. 

Although I eventually got over it, like you I had an irrational hatred of 11 for over a year after Tennant left. The End of Time left me a emotional wreck. Although I love Tennant's performance in it I can barely bear to watch it because I always break down in tears during his speech to Wilfred and during Vale Decem. I feel like I'm losing a best friend. I've watched the entire new series more times than I can count. I have only watched the End of Time a handful of times, however. It hurts too much.

I wanted to share this with you. It's a motivational speech edited together from 10's soundbytes. It always brings a smile to my face and really helps me when I'm feeling down. I hope it does the same for you.

The Doctor had already lost the Ponds once that day, he didn't need to do it again. When Amy realised that her husband was gone, she couldn't leave him. Nothing could make her leave him. The Doctor begged her not to go. Even though The Doctor pleaded her, Amy told River to be a good girl and to watch after her best friend for her. When she left, you had already gone through the initial shock of their departure, and then in the graveyard there was that horribly emotional ordeal. there is no way that anyone can go through that many feels and come out unscathed.

1. Professor (lots of research, much administration, little teaching, get your name on plenty of papers you didn't write)

It's a long, hard road and between each of those steps a huge proportion drop out. Professors work mainly in sales: writing and winning proposals to do research contracts.

Further data point: I know someone who used to be a full-on departmental professor in a world-class UK university. Now, almost all British universities (even the very best ones) are what you would call ""public"", that is mainly funded from taxes. When he moved into the private sector he nearly tripled his salary.

Personally, I'm still not sure it fits together. After TBOSJ, she has (or thinks she has) a pretty good idea of who the Doctor is - an alien with two hearts who can't fly a plane and goes around crooking his finger for people to jump in his snog box. So why does she say ""so that's who"" as though the question had been troubling her before? Was there another mystery figure in her life, who the book made her realize was the Doctor? (We saw her meet him once as a kid, but not as a mystery figure.) Was she somehow realizing who it was that the Doctor said she reminded him of?

On the other hand, that was a failed timeline, so the show probably won't go back to that scene directly. So you're probably right about that part; it's probably her way of saying ""so that's what his real name is"", or ""I never knew that was who he was"".

true,JamesB5446,cnty-scotland,Cleethorpes,"&gt; Some (most) of those things would be impossible to implement in existing cities though, wouldn't they?

Nope.

&gt; Milton Keynes has excellent provision for cyclists, with tracks which are completely separate from the roads (many of then don't even follow the same route as any road). But that was designed in from the very start, they went on the plan at the same time as the roads and buildings, and they were built at the same time.

MK started well but then more priority was given to motorised traffic over cycling and walking. [This is worth reading.](http://aseasyasridingabike.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/they-built-it-and-they-didnt-come-the-lesson-of-milton-keynes/)

&gt; The reason a lot of cycle lanes are very narrow is because that is the most space you can take while still leaving the road wide enough for cars to use. A fenced off cycle lane would have to be a lot wider, and most places there isn't the space.

In those cases you have to take some space away from cars.

&gt; Do these things get retro-fitted in Holland, or is it just that they have been doing it so long that most places were built like that in the first place?

Imagine then that some of your sketches of Joe get shared on Reddit &amp; alas the user re-shared on imgur which removes the image metadata and has also cropped the image so it no longer shows your sig or web address.

The picture in question is of Joe hugging a baby, it's from a witty strip you did that was meant to show that just because someone is pro-choice doesn't mean that they hate babies, BUT just the last ""Joe hugs a baby"" panel is shared. It gets posted to /r/aww and gets a small number of upvotes. One of the few that do see it works for a small ad agency that are putting a leaflet together for a large pro-life campaign group, they're looking for some clipart for the cover and see a cute bear hugging a baby. They do a few searches for ""Bear hugging baby"" or ""Bear loves baby"" etc and don't find the source, they apply under these new rules for the rights for use and go ahead.

Your picture is now on the front of a few thousand leaflets promoting a cause that you don't believe in, would not want to see yourself endorse and have had zero choice in the matter. Ok, if you find out you may get industry rate money for Joe's use. Big fucking whoop!

Johnson, Carragher etc ( I don't really want to leave anyone out)

With Sturridge and Coutinho i feel blessed to be watching them play for liverpool. I think we've rescued their careers ( or at least brought a new height) and they really feel lucky to be here, to fight for every point.

Borini and Allen has a huge point to prove that they deserve to be here and wants to start games and i hope they show more to challenge the regular first team players next season.

Then there's the young members of the club, Sterling who've shown us so much and so much to come, Suso as well, Wisdom. I think they really get it and always confirms how much they want to be here for the long term.

I haven't been so positive in a long time about lfc. Personally, ever since the H&amp;G saga, each season has been more depressing after the next (except for King Kenny's honeymoon). I think the players really get it now and we'll be so much better with new additions next season.

&gt;-30 Apr 2013-

&gt;Qatari telecommunications firm Ooredoo has moved to deny reports that it is in talks with Liverpool over a joint shirt and stadium naming rights sponsorship deal.

&gt;Al Jazeera Sports, citing an Ooredoo director, had previously reported the company was keen to utilise the global power of the English Premier League club’s brand to boost its presence in the Asian market. Ooredoo recently rebranded from Qtel, but a company spokesperson on Monday stated there is no truth in the reports linking the firm to what would have been a big-money deal.

&gt;The spokesperson told the ArabianBusiness.com website: “There is no basis for the current speculation linking us to the sponsorship of a Premier League football club. If the situation changes, we will – as always – be open and transparent in our communication with the media and with our customers.”

&gt;Al Jazeera had quoted an Ooredoo director as stating: “The goal was to sponsor a big English club with a huge history, our search included Arsenal and Manchester United but the former two have long sponsorship deals and the same applies to Manchester City, so Liverpool is the only club available right now. We want to sponsor the club in full. We want to sponsor the stadium as well as the club’s kits. Our goal is to reach the Asian markets where the Premier League has an enormous fan base. We received the tender from the club a few days ago and we are currently in the process of due diligence and we are studying each aspect of the study.”",0,1367308230,null,0,false,0,c9phr13,t3_1dedgp,t1_c9phr13,t3_1dedgp,null,1431375558,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

BoSJ was pretty entertaining but it doesn't seem to really add much to the Oswin mystery other than just introducing the new version of Clara. Was good to see the great intelligence back so soon though. 

RoA was okay, I didn't think the shot with them in front of the planet was all that amazing, and the story had some good moments but was ultimately weak. Scene design was pretty weak too.

CW was overall stronger than RoA, but it was more of a middling episode, having neither the highs nor lows the preceding episode. 

Hide was brilliant, marred only by the seemingly tacked on Romeo and Juliet ending for the creatures. I can forgive the occasional plot hole if the overall story is as entertaining as Hide was, and I liked that they were only there in the first place because the Doctor was trying to get more info on Clara.

JttCotT was very good, largely dissatisfying because of hype and over-expectations. The sub plot with the brothers took up way too much screen time that could have been filled with TARDIS rooms. One brother died too quickly for any sort of emotional connection with the audience and one was a largely two dimensional jerk. The youngest brother is by far the most interesting, especially his sensitivity to the TARDIS considering he wasn't even a real android. The episode lacked a greater sense of importance, what with the big friendly reset button at the end, the only lasting contribution being Clara's seeming innocence even in the most dire of circumstances. Plus I don't think there was a big enough wow moment. I think they were trying to make that the frozen exploded engine room, but it should have been the Eye of Harmony. The Eye of Harmony should have put Akhaten to shame, effects-wise.

Obviously I don't know where Steven Moffatt is going with Clara, but I would've loved to see the engine exploding in JttCotT tied into the TARDIS exploding in season 5, perhaps with Clara being spread throughout all of time and space because she was in the engine room when it exploded.

The proposed changes to the justice system are transforming prisoners into slave labourers. It raises lots of problems that most people won't even consider, not least that forcing prisoners to work for less than minimum wage removes job opportunities from the more law-abiding and jobless members of society. There's also the continuing problem that despite these working schemes within prisons the government does little to help ex-convicts find work once they're released.

That money isn't produced from nothing, it's taken from the richest.  Leaving exactly the same amount of money as there ever was.

I also think you're playing fast and loose with the ideas of rich_er_ and rich.  It's by no means making everyone have the same level of wealth -- I have not the least socialist leanings in me.  Don't worry yourself, there would still be poor people and rich people; it's simply a more efficient way of doing the wealth redistribution _which we already do_.

Let me restate it: if we want to have a welfare state, where nobody goes hungry, but we simultaneously don't want to distort the incentives to make work unattractive, and rampant fecundity attractive, then we should supply that minimum amount needed to live in the form of raw cash.  We should do it by giving that minimum raw cash to everyone equally.  We then fund that giveaway unequally, so that the richest (who have a different marginal utility for a pound than the poorest) pay more.  Now, even the rich get given the same equal refund, so that means everyone has a REBATE-TAX=NET_GAIN value -- if your tax is higher than the rebate, you are paying for the system, if your rebate is higher than the tax, then you are being paid by the system.  The rebate is set such that it is the minimum necessary to make sure nobody dies -- we wouldn't be making poor people rich in any way.

They have a redirect for your post, scan it, securely store it for 2 weeks, and if you don't need the original securely shred it.

It is a great example of a *bridge* between my world, my work and my life and our old Royal Mail.

Royal Mail really needs to change what it is, if I want to write a nice letter to my gran, how much does that cost?  Paper 4p, ink 1p, envelope 10p, stamp 60p.  Or if its small enough 46p.

Either way, thats quite a lot of money.  A phone call is certain to be cheaper.  But wait, she has broadband (£6.50 a month) and I bought a Nexus 7, painted the power button orange, and gimped android with a simple shell that just runs skype.

Now assuming I write one letter a month, it is a cost premium of £6 a month, that allows my Grandmother to Skype everyone, me, my parents, my aunt, her great granddaughter. 

That price for internet is probably going to go down as well over the next few years.

So that is another pensioner left only with bills and the like coming by post.  Nothing that needs a 1st class service either.

Meanwhile, most companies have realised the cost of printing bills is rather high, and a great chance to nickle and dime those who are luddites, I think my mobile phone company charge £3.50 a month for sending out paper.  My bank have stopped a long time ago (I had some fraud with a cheque book that went missing, my local postie said he reckoned it was the seasonal staff, police of course, just gave me a crime number).

Which is the question, who is going to be wanting the Royal Mail we have today in a decade?  We will want the ability to send more parcel type objects, faster when in the same city/town (Amazon already do same day delivery in London), but at the same time people often aren't at home, due to more people living on their own (Amazon Lockers anyone?).

See I missed PSO when it was out but then again I was only 13 and entirely hooked on FFs 7,8 and 9 and essentially played them over and over again. Those were my defining games when I was growing up and still love the sound tracks; sweet sweet nostalgia. I actually went to see the Distant Worlds concert in the Royal Albert Hall last year for the 25th anniversary. Special mention for Abe's Oddysee/Exodus and Metal Gear Solid as well. Oh and Sonic 1,2,3, Sonic &amp; Knuckles and the Sonic game on the Dreamcast...which I can't remember. 

My mate had Halo 1 and 2 but in the end, on account of being shockingly bad at it, I stopped playing with/against him. I was forever getting head-shot by handguns from the length of the map by people with an insane amount of skill. Mario Kart though....I've still got Mario Kart: Double Dash and love it, same with Luigi's Mansion and the Zelda classics. I was working my way through Ocarina of Time (again!) and Twilight Princess before the sun came out :)

So there's that I was pretty engrossed in PC games like Starcraft, Diablo aaaand an embarrassing amount of time on WoW: and when I say embarrassing I'm talking months of play time on a single character....and I had like 8....I don't play any more though and I'm hoping you won't judge me too harshly on it.

I've become a bit of a convert in terms of PC gaming - anything single player with a great storyline and is visually impressive gets an Xbox controller plugged in and put up on the big screen; so things like Skyrim or Mass Effect. The ability to get cheaper DLC and mod the games to look even better just makes it a little more appealing than a console. 

Essentially though anything that's fun, has a great storyline, great sound track and plays well I'm a fan of - anything that looks great and can be modded I'm even more of a fan of.

As for non-PC/Console games I tried a couple of things like Warhammer and Magic the Gathering...didn't get on with it. I loved playing games like Risk though I never found anyone to enjoy them.

There is no set criterion for evaluating GCSEs, but they are certainly taken into account as part of the ""academic story"" that your application tells.  GCSE results (and A-level results) are also taken within the context of the school's overall performance, to which admissions tutors have access.  Looking back on previous years, while all our successful applicants (engineering science) were very strong, they have varying levels of success at GCSE.

In my subject, the application form nominally is weighted similarly to the interview, although this will vary with individual circumstances.  Your admissions tutors are, pretty much without exception, very good at doing what they do - that's why they are doing it.  That means, you can expect fair treatment, encouragement where needed, and where the goal is to help you demonstrate your best.

The myths surrounding the ""Oxford interview"" that the press likes to propagate are not helpful, and entirely inaccurate.  If anything, they just serve to put off applications from those school-leavers from whom we'd like to encourage applications.

Still, regardless of whether the system catches them or not, that wasn't at issue or debated.

By the very meaning of the term ""BTL"" a BTL landlord cannot inherit the houses they rent can they? I know a landlord who died recently a millionaire. You'd not have known him from the time he had no money and his wife was working three jobs to make ends meet though. You'd just see this guy with a string of properties and a six figure bank balance and assumed he'd just been gifted it or magicked it from his arse. 

Turnover does not equal profit. I get £6k in rent from mine a year, less than 1/3 of that is profit. 

&gt; Why do you reserve your scorn for those that are born poor?

I was born poor to a level probably a shitload worse than you were. I reserve my scorn for those who blame their situation on everyone but themselves.

&gt; If you want to demand that those who are born rich, they too have to work for a living, then you will have a consistent position.

Why should someone who has enough money to live on without working work unless they wanted to? In fact by them doing just what you seem to want that takes a job away from someone who is in desperate need of a job.

Cost me quite a bit as I had oversized pupils and had to get wavefront style of treatment that is expensive, so it cost £2,700. However I do know people who had it done for about £700. 

Got it done in Milton Keynes, coming from Cambridge, it was a bit further than I needed to go but I got an appointment a month earlier.

If you live near an Optical Express you can just go in and book an appointment to make sure you can have the treatment.

The last point on my previous reply was, again, intended as light-hearted (self-deprecation and a ;) smiley). People feel negatively about subcultures for one or both of two reasons:

1) a general unease brought about by misunderstanding (refs my initial point)

2) repeated negative experiences with individual members of any given subculture. 

My point was to highlight that, in my own personal experience, I am far more likely to be verbally (and, on occasion, physically) attacked by a member of the ""jock"" or ""chav"" subculture than by a goth. That will obviously taint my view of the group as a whole, not suggesting that they are all that way, but that the chances of meeting one will more likely result in a negative experience.

I don't know how old you are, or your previous education/work experience, but if you're going for undergrad I'd look at [UCAS](http://ucas.com/students/). It's how you apply for universities en masse (well, up to the 5 maximum you're allowed), but you can use it to search for courses at universities. If you're doing postgrad stuff, [UKPASS](http://www.ukpass.ac.uk/students/) is the site you'll use.

If I may offer some bits of advice, if you're already in university then don't try to transfer, there is no real international transfer system. And unless your family is rich and you have money, don't bother with London. It's very expensive to live in, and you'd be required to have $14,000 to support yourself instead. Also, if you're in uni now, try to get really good grades because there aren't many scholarships available to international students, and the tuition for masters is more like $30,000+, so you'll want to be able to get as much support through scholarships as possible. If you're thinking of working, and are still in uni, you'll need to get 5+ years of experience in your field because UK companies will even look at your CV unless you're super incredibly awesome at what you do (statistically speaking you're not, don't mean to offend.)",0,1367324863,null,0,false,0,c9pjyti,t3_1daufu,t1_c9pjyti,t1_c9pjowv,null,1431374514,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Users do not need a licence or insurance but must register their vehicle with the DVLA.

&gt;PC Williams, who runs training sessions, said: ""I had a go on one... when you start accelerating away it's quite daunting.""

&gt;Regarding compulsory training he said: ""I certainly think that would be of great assistance because you can't get behind the wheel of any car or motorbike without any mandatory training.

&gt;""You can buy them online now and put them together yourself without any training whatsoever.

&gt;""The complaints I have received in Christchurch are [about] people who have been going into supermarkets and not reducing the speed limit.

&gt;""If you clip someone's ankle... you can cause injury to yourself or another, so certainly that needs to be looked at.""

&gt;But he warned users they were not immune from prosecution and could face fines or worse.

&gt;""We've had stories where people have been intoxicated driving them - you still fall foul of the law.""

I have to say though, I think there's a better answer than 'slapalicenseonit'. Remember that the majority of users are riding responsibly, and mobility scooters are quite literally a lifeline for the people who need them - they would likely be housebound without.

That argument is rather disingeniously close to 'cyclists should be licensed' - it just seems like extra bureaucracy which will drop the number of users massively, without really making anyone any safer. Besides which, what about electric wheelchairs? Where does one category start and the other stop? Would young children who rely on electric wheelchairs be allowed to keep using them, or told 'sorry, you have to be over 12 to be licensed now'? Etc, etc. Bad idea.

But, regardless, they were ugly because they were burnt. They were all over the ship because cracks in time from the exploded TARDIS engine put them there.

&gt;And why did the brothers turn into a conjoined twin version when they touched

Their burnt selves were conjoined, so the Doctor figured that by keeping their healthy selves separated they could avoid becoming conjoined, and thus rewrite that timeline.

true,KaiserMacCleg,,,"[A History of Wales](http://www.amazon.co.uk/A-History-Wales-John-Davies/dp/0140284753/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) by John Davies is the best, most objective overview of Welsh history out there, IMO.  It's brilliantly written (and brilliantly translated - it was originally published as *Hanes Cymru*), and is a sincere attempt to provide as honest a view of Welsh history as possible, lacking the political skew ever present in Gwyn Alf Williams' and Gwynfor Evans' books.

Welsh history has been notably absent from our TV over the past few decades, but a major new series was broadcast last year by the BBC. [The Story of Wales](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Story-of-Wales-DVD/dp/B007PBK5FW) is a decent starting point when it comes to Welsh History, and is entertaining to watch, but it only gives you the bare bones, really (inevitable as it's only six hours long).  It highlights some interesting aspects of Welsh history but completely omits other incredibly important events / periods / stuff (eg. extermination of the Druids on Anglesey, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, Welsh literature). Still, it's worth a look, and you can watch the entire series free [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVAvRlTRnh8yI8LQ2WyIO19kpNEzWOUeb).

true,PlayingForTheShirt,,Bangor,"&gt; There's a lot of contradictions at play. Someone said during the flag protests that ""we're all a minority now"". While I utterly detest the rudderless politics of the guy who said it I can see the logic and the follow on is that NI politics is a motley collection of self-interest groups who collectively have very narrow and differing definitions of what the issues are and how to address them.

Everyone is a minority because everyone has their different issues. I'm personally concerned with regional government (more powers to councils), taxation (less taxes) and public spending cuts. Others are concerned with the state of union or job creation or public sector wages or whatever. Long gone are the days of where tribal politics ruled the roost for all in real politics. The issue is that people in NI still vote along tribal lines but all their issues aren't being addressed - this created minorities within these tribal lines and as you put it, self interest groups. 

&gt; Given that we seem to be diverging from a bi-polar society into an equally divided one - just with many more poles - how would even opposition-based politics here rule effectively? The performance of those in power sharing at the moment leaves so much to be desired in terms of long term strategy - whether it's SF's 'break everything British' ploys or the DUP's tactical manipulations of current events with no regard to cause and effect - that I want the devolved administration to have less power not more as things stand. Tax-raising powers? Not a hope.

Indeed there doesn't seem to be a hope in hell of more powers being devolved if the current regime stays in place and tbh I'd rather those powers be devolved if there was a new establishment setup because I'm selfish and don't want the DUP &amp; SF to get those powers. 

&gt; Getting back to cause and effect, so long as one party here clings to the remnants of revolution this unfit dynamic will always have fuel. What's worse is that due to their beliefs they have no interest in seeing NI move forward. How can you solve dysfunctional politics here when arguably that's a by-product of one of the main party's in the government?

Going to use the term self-interest again here. This government is working in self-interest. They will cling to power by running out the tribal lines every so often. SF will do their thing, DUP will do their thing, UUP, SDLP etc. etc. They've had years of practice at doing it so they are experts in the field. There is no way of solving this 'dysfunctional politics' without the people themselves actually rejecting the notion of tribal politics which serves self-interested politicians.

true,TopdeBotton,null,null,"Behavioural economics on the whole isn't inherently right-wing and if anything, a lot of what it says contradicts the standard neo-classical/neo-liberal ideas of modern economic theory. 

I'd go as far as to say that's a fundamental part of the field; it corrects traditional nonsense in economics. 

So I find it strange that David Cameron's government would be spending money on a ""nudge"" unit. It's ironic that on the one hand the Conservatives hold old-fashioned views that jobseekers are lazy and fraudulent and yet on the other hand believe that they can be ""nudged"" into finding work. 

I think the criticism here is largely misplaced. I'm not particularly keen on psychometric testing and I think it's easily manipulated as the video shows. Behavioural economics is largely sound however and about as common sense as economics or social science can be. 

There is a placing for ""nudging"" in policy, however this doesn't seem like a particularly good use. A better, simpler way to get people into work would simply be to create more jobs in the economy. People don't need ""nudges"" at times like these; there are thousands upon thousands that would jump at real job opportunities but they don't exist in sufficient numbers. 

Nudging would make sense if unemployment was very low and there was a small section of society that did need a push to find jobs that did exist - but that's plainly not the case in today's Britain. 

This is a case of good science (behavioural economics) being mixed with bad science (psychometric testing) to effect a change that isn't possible. The problem isn't that people don't want to work, it's that people are being pushed towards jobs they are overqualified for or simply have the wrong skills-set for. 

The government shouldn't be convincing people to find any job that is out there but ""nudging"" Number 11 to change tack on austerity. The fault isn't with jobseekers, it's with the policies meant to create jobs. 

An ever-shrinking economy won't be successful in pushing people into jobs if they are evaporating with each day. ",0,1367327669,null,0,false,0,c9pkjsp,t3_1deiaa,t1_c9pkjsp,t1_c9pjplv,null,1431374239,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

Positive Psychology is a movement within the academic Psychology world to shift away from 'making sick people better' and instead studying how one can live a life full of well being. It was started by and has since been championed by [Professor Martin Seligman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Seligman) and the whole idea has since become a big business. It's a rapidly growing field of study and I'll point out that it is all backed by serious scientific principles, experimentation and rigour. It has also been picked up on by certain goverments (including ours) as a better method of measuring well being within a population rather than using things such as gross household income.

Now, clearly, the people whom the government have hired to create this shorter version of the test have gone wrong in some way, and why they don't just use Seligman's version of the test which is seen as the definitive one, I don't know (especially as it's free to do online). But it shouldn't take away from the validity of the field of study.

Aside from that, here are a few reasons off the top of my head why the theory is wrong along with why it was downvoted:  
  
1. This would mean Amy and Rory are still companions. Their actors are no longer with the show, so that's impossible.   
2. This would mean all the character development of Clara is null and void. Big no-no, making us care for someone over an entire season that never existed.  
3. Tied in with number 2, Clara is IN the 50th Anniversary, so unless THAT'S a dream too, which it's not, as Clara's mystery will be solved in the S7 Finale...

Liverpool preparing £30m bid for Michu

Share

INDEPENDENT·6 HOURS AGO
LIVERPOOL are reportedly the latest Premier League side to take an interest in Swansea City striker Michu according to Italian source TuttoMercato.

Brendan Rodgers is perhaps keen to beef up his striking options given that Luis Suarez will miss the first six matches of next term but may well have to fork out a big sum to land the in-form Spaniard.

Liberty Stadium boss Michael Laudrup believes that the player he picked up for a bargain price of just £1.9m last summer isnow worth £30m.

Arsenal had the fluid, attacking football allure and are media darlings thanks to a healthy financial statement and a reluctance to join the big spending theme that some people seem to hate. They had a unique mix of heritage, likeable manager and a modus operandi that seems to strike a chord with so many neutrals. I think they would be the closest thing to a successful team that still remained a neutral's favourite. Back in the  day that is, nowadays they are more loveable loser than stylish winner

I don't think Chelsea will be in that position for a long, long time. Then again, I'd rather be the ruthless winner everybody loves to hate, rather than the soft-bellied team that lacks the 'win at all costs' mentality.

It absolutely is an economic issue, who pays for it all? your talking about kids going into the army (what 16+ up?) they are going to have to be paid one way or another right? who pays for that? we do. If we cant afford to pay for every kid to go to uni we certainly can not afford to put them in the army. How long does this national service last? months? Years? It costs £40k to keep a prisoner locked up for a year in this country (http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-for-the-new-parliament/security-and-liberty/the-prison-population/) so add a years pay on top of that very basic lifestyle (15k) and thats £65k a person, £65k for millions of kids. Yeah, its not an economic issue at all is it?

&gt;It's the attitude of modern Britain. 

Being effeminite? so women are the problem then? what are you on about?

&gt;Installs discipline in young people, teaches them skills, makes them employable, gets them fit and healthy (encourage healthy lifestyle which will reduce obesity rates in later life), teaches them independence etc. There are so many benefits to having a programme like this.

They wont let you in if you aren't already decently fit and healthy and if a kid wasn't forcing them through national service is going to do them any good, Army lifestyle isn't exactly the healthiest either to be honest. So we are going to be basically paying around (low estimate) £40k for them to go to the gym for a year? For them how to cook basic military food that most of them by that age know how to cook anyway? When i was in school this was all covered by pe and some cooking classes at a fraction of the expense. How does it make anyone employable, people who come out of the army have a notoriously hard time getting work, other than going back into the army. There are very very little benefits vs the cost and what it would take to implement this whole thing.

&gt;Are you out of your mind? Do you know how many opportunities are in the army? You can go into engineering, first aid, police, intelligence corps etc. This would equip so many people with actual skills they could take into the working environment rather than being left o nthe scrapheap of cashier work.

No one in their right mind is going to let some 16-18 year old near any intelligence corps never mind, police, more than likely they be scrubbing dishes or something along those lines for the same pay they'd get in a real job with regular freedoms, a job that isn't paid for by the government. If they really wanted to do proper, profitible engineering they should go on an actual plumbing and gas maintenance course not some random Army one, do the proper one so they can get the actual certificates, that they can use towards a proper job.

Who pays for the army? just ask yourself that. Its the taxpayer. At a time where the government is reducing the real army, you want to get every kid in the country at a certain age to be paid for by the taxpayer to scrub dishes and go to the gym? What a farce. 

Did you do national service by any chance? im going to guess you didn't but apparently ""kids today"" are the problem? at the end of the day the majority of 16-18 year olds do no wrong and are more intelligent and skilled than they have ever been the reason youth unemployment is high isnt to do with their lack of skills. Forcing the majority because a small minority dont adhere to all of society's wishes (as in not doing anything illegal , just unemployed, on benefit and the like) or if they are ""effeminate""

true,SuperSonic4,eu,Burrrmin'am,"&gt;So I find it strange that David Cameron's government would be spending money on a ""nudge"" unit. It's ironic that on the one hand the Conservatives hold old-fashioned views that jobseekers are lazy and fraudulent and yet on the other hand believe that they can be ""nudged"" into finding work. 

I think it's so they appear to be doing something rather than any inclination it'll work. It's another excuse to call jobseekers lazy and fraudulent (unless they're rich enough to not need a job of course) and it's far easier than creating the jobs needed. 

It's also a clever little trick, because it allows people to be pushed into jobs that are not on the JSA agreement by using these bogus strengths and I'm guessing almost all of these would be for whichever part-time, zero hour contract is going *du jour*

I know this is controversial but I think the Tories want relatively large unemployment:

* The rich/poor gap increases
* Worker's rights are more easily infringed because of lack of job security

The second thing is, we've seen in the past how overwhelmingly guilty he feels whenever something bad happens to one of his companions.  We saw what happened at the end of Rose and Donna's storylines, and there have been plenty of times when he was reluctant to take people along with him because of his guilt.

The third thing is (I know I said two, buzz off) that while the doctor solves mysteries on the daily, there is something incredibly unique about Clara that at the moment he's quite preoccupied with.  There's a good possibility he just doesn't want to give up without finding the answer.

By no means are Elderly drivers an outright risk but there certainly appears to be an increased potential for lapses in attention or sloppy driving. Roundabout, dual lanes, blind spot checks, indicators and creeping out of junctions into traffic are their biggest flaws I've seen. Extremes have been forcing cyclists off of the road, ignoring temporary traffic lights (blows through reds) and opening doors without checking.

You banded race about, I simply mirrored what you were doing and you couldn't take it.

Other people downvoted you for your stupidity.

true,sgtakase,smith,Smith,"&gt;the last episode Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS had great potential, but the ending was a huge cop out.

Sure it was. But can you think of another way to get them out of that situation? Also it wasn't that bad and made sense. The universe was cracking because the TARDIS was exploding again (see Series 5) and because the Doctor already knew to an extent what he was dealing with, he knew that he should lock onto a signal to point to the point in time they could've prevented it.


&gt;They keep using the same ending ""rewrite time"" or ""wibbly wobbly""]

I can only think of a few, The Big Bang, The Wedding of River Song, and Journey to the Center of the TARDIS as far as rewriting time goes. What do you mean when you say wibbly wobbly? That just seems like too general a term to describe an episode.

&gt;Another example was how Rivers story was ruined, I felt having her be a companions daughter was a bit lame

It wasn't the best way to go about her story, but I thought it was interesting. Going in opposite directions their stories made sense. She grew up fantasizing about destroying the Doctor, but grew to be infatuated with him. Then thats when her character took her down spin, but after The Byzantium (more specifically after the wedding) she starts to become closer to her original form in the library. It made sense that she was much more of a one line catchphrase that was all flirt, people forget is that even if she looks older than the Doctor and her parents, that most of the time we see her is in her younger days. 

&gt;and now they're trying to make up for it with Clara who is essentially the same basic idea. 

How so? One is a mystery that the Doctor doesn't really investigate. Actually, not even really a huge mystery, he knew that shes only lived one life (but later found in different forms) but the only mystery was how she knew his name, which again, he doesn't really search into.  It just happens that events lead him to finding out. As far as he knew going into Demon's Run to save Melody, River was a completely different person. Now we have this enigma of Clara that the Doctor actually cannot figure out, which scares him. Just because she is a flirting girl with a mystery behind her doesn't mean that she and River are the same.

If you boil down anything enough youll get to the same ***basic*** idea. ",0,1367338469,null,0,false,0,c9pnwt9,t3_1dewyn,t1_c9pnwt9,t3_1dewyn,null,1431372584,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

North Wales is very rural and more people speak the Welsh langauge there (they are called 'Gogs' which comes from 'Gogledd', or north).

Here is the quiz btw: http://www.behaviourlibrary.com/strengths.php

I'll give you a quick run through of what the (very poorly written) code does.

There are 48 questions (with a buffer of empty string coz this guy can't deal with 0 indexes properly.)

They come in order in pairs, with the first pair being the positive for a category and the second pair being the negative for a category.

e.g. for ""love of learning"": 

positive questions is ""I am thrilled when I learn something new""
negative question is ""I never go out of my way to visit museums""

There are 24 strength categories:

""Curiosity"", ""Love of learning"", ""Critical Thinking"", "" Originality"", ""Social Intelligence"", ""Perspective"", ""Bravery"", ""Dedication"", ""Honesty"", ""Kindness"", ""Loving"", ""Teamwork"", ""Fairness"", ""Leadership"", ""Self Control"", ""Carefulness"", ""Modesty"", ""Appreciation of Culture"", ""Gratitude"", ""Optimism"", ""Spirituality"", ""Forgiveness"", "" Humour"", ""Enthusiasm""

So 1 for each 2 questions.

Your score for each category is 1-5 for both questions (so a total of 2-10)

The categories are then ordered and you get the top 5 back out. So even if you rank everything as 2, you'll still have 5 strengths. Because its a stable sort the order should match the original order. So a lot more people will be curious than enthusiatic!

Anyway, safe to say this is a completely bollocks test proving absolutely nothing about you as a person other than taking two questions for you to decide if you're brave.

I just want to take a brief second to rant about the code, at first I hoped that as it was php page this js was outputted from a more versatile php script. But looking at the JS its clear is almost entirely hardcoded.
The JS really looks like it took about an hour to write. Its not awful, though there are a few mistakes, but it is horrendously basic. It's also incredibly specific to the problem it's solving.

Imagine if you wanted to a third question to determine someone's originality. The whole thing would have to be rewritten. It has no modularisation at all.

I disagree. The first two episodes of the season I thought were pretty crap. Bells of St John and Rings of Akatan were boring with crummy stories. I thought *since* those episodes it is getting better. Cold War was pretty cool, and not only because Davos was in it, and Hide was amazing. Journey to the center of the tardis seems to be getting a LOT of hate, but I really loved the episode. I think peoples expectation of it were waaaaay too high. They heard the title, and thought, wow! That's going to be the most epic, amazing, mind blowing episode ever! And when it didn't live up to their expectations, they call it crap. (It did live up to my expectations, as I said above, i thought it was a fantastic episode)

&gt;and, frankly, insults its audience by saying

And I'm sorry, but I am *seriously* sick of hearing people say they are **insulted** by what happens in the show. The fucking creators didn't take your personal feelings into account? Too bloody bad.

My advice is to find out what your grant and loan adds up to, work out a weekly budget, and try to get a part time job if you'll need more money. Most people I know at uni don't have a job, but there are also plenty of people who do. 

I lived on £60 per week for food, drinks, transport, socialising etc and dipped into some savings whenever I needed something outside of my budget (ie textbooks).

I'm spoiled, in that I basically live on really cheap, high quality sushi at home which English sushi absolutely pales in comparison to, but I've managed to find some alright stuff here.

Yo Sushi is the easiest and most convenient option. Conveyor belt sushi bars are always really fun, and as someone else mentioned, Mondays are £2.40 a plate, which is good if you're not dumb about what you order. Skip things like soybeans and california rolls, and go for the salmon sashimi plates, and hand-rolls. They actually have really high-quality salmon here, so go crazy with that. On the other hand, the tuna is pretty bad, and some of the maki plates are way overpriced.

Obento is alright, they have some sort of half-price special on weekdays, I think. I've only been there once or twice, and can't really remember what I got, but hey, they're cheap!

Masa is also pretty mediocre. The meal wasn't at all memorable, the service was shitty, and it didn't feel like a very clean establishment. Definitely wouldn't recommend it.

Yume Kitchen just opened up near the university on Cotham hill, and I'm a fan. They're inexpensive, and have high quality fish, especially the salmon. Also, they're the only place in England I've found with an authentic California roll/rainbow roll, that is crab chopped up and mixed with a bit of japanese mayonnaise and sriracha. So much better than the crabstick rolls you get elsewhere.

Noa in Clifton is the best for maki, but they're damned expensive. About £20 for four six-piece rolls, but they're heavy on the rice, so it's enough to share. Their soft-shell crab roll is one of the best things I've eaten over here, I just wish they were cheaper.

In seasons five and six, the Doctor used his cunning to get out of hairy situations, like when he wrote a virus which would turn all digital items to zero and had Prisoner Zero disguise itself as itself so that it would be discovered. But the more recent episodes, it seems like there's all this run around that doesn't add up or make sense and then everything is solved by dumb luck or something out of left field that magically makes everything better, like the giant reset button. I think the closest they've come to this in recent episodes was Clara's initial episode where the Doctor used their own robot soul-sucking device thing against them, but even that plotline was dull and nonsensical, as the audience never found out the reason people were being captured or who the ""client"" was, as far as I can remember.

It's a tough'n. I for one hope we keep our 4-4-1-1 with Gareth playing a number 10, find a pacey LW, like Atsu at Porto, and a prolific striker, Benteke, please god, and move forward that way.

I think the doctor see's the earth at this point as... ""his"". His to protect, and guide to the future he knows is coming for them. It's certainly his home. It's where he feels safe having christmas dinner, it's where he goes to brood.

He goes to a sort of depressing, brooding time in earths history. (And one where he's fairly sure he won't run into himself.)

All in all, good theory!

It's been called an intermediate formation, with the view of moving towards a 4-3-3, but I'm not sure. The team, the players, all seem pretty confident with it, and to change it up to what is, in reality, a completely different formation, especially when the midfield and wings are concerned.

The problem last game is that Scotty was forced to play a role he didn't understand, and Holtby was too. We lacked structure because those two were running around the place leaving gaps open.
This meant that Clint and Gaz were forced inward to try to get the bloody ball, whilst also playing on their opposite wings to their strong feet.

So, we were caught out, out played and generally out worked by the Wigan side that, really, we should've beaten.

I thought that AVB would have worked them out better, and I was extremely disappointed with his choices.

I want to see:

-------------Lloris-----------

Walker--Vert--Daws--BAE

-Huddlestone--Dembele-

Lennon----Bale----Siggy

Secondly, you must consider every man your enemy who speaks ill of your king;

In the case of short term illness or absence abroad the Counsellors of State can take over her duties, these are Philip, Charles, William, Harry, and Andrew.

So there's no need for the Queen to abdicate. If she wanted to retire she could be declared incapacitated, or she can cope with illness and old age by taking holidays while being signed off. Just don't tell the DWP.

I think the more likely thing is that she lets Charles and William do most of the leg work visiting and entertaining, and she just keeps up with the paperwork from a country estate.

It's completely legal to own a TV but not have a TV license. The TV can be used for watching DVDs, games consoles, a big screen for your tablet, a monitor for a desktop PC - anything really except watching broadcast TV.

The notification thing has put me off buying a TV (I could use an extra HDMI monitor with built-in speakers, but it's not worth the risk of being hassled) but I guess the TV license authority has been forced to accept that people have reasons to buy TVs that don't require a license.

I'm surprised you didn't get at least a letter but then they're not supposed to contact you for two years each time you sign a declaration anyway.

I've been a little over 4 years without a license now. No visit yet - just letters. But it's good to know the visits aren't that bad.

Alright, so let's go back to 1963 real quick.

The Doctor's granddaughter, Susan, wanted to go to earth to study it or whatever. She goes to a high school there, and has been doing so for some time.

Then two of her teachers, Barbra and Ian, notice that she's *very* smart, and already knows the subjects before they teach it, always gets 100% on tests, etc.

Around the same time that they notice how brilliant she is, they also notice that she's coming in to classes late or something like that.

Then one day, they're sitting in a car talking about her, and then in classic television cliché, Susan walks down the street right in front of their car. They go ""Hey look, isn't that Susan, the girl we've been talking about? I wonder what she's doing out so late?""

They then watch her go into a junkyard. Obviously, this is really suspicious, so they decide to ~~stalk~~ observer her.

They open the door to the junkyard just in time to see her walk into a small box with an old man. Now, of course, they're really concerned, so instead of calling the police or anything, they go in after her.

When they get inside, Ian goes ""Susan, what are you doing in a junkyard with an old man in a snogbox?"" while Barbra seems to be the only one noticing that it's bigger on the inside. She brings this to Ian's attention, then the Doctor goes around and says ""Sorry, you've seen too much. I'm afraid I cannot let you leave.""

Susan argues with him for a bit, and he eventually decides to leave earth and take them with him.

Your frustrations sound like you think *too much* is happening; I'm not sure why you're bored? 

&gt;Moffatt was great for single episodes (Blink, Doctor Dances ect) but these season long stories are awful.

Season 7 has been decidedly not season-long arc heavy and much more episode-by-episode.  The ""episode is a movie"" theme really drives that home.  Also, I really enjoyed Moffatt's A Good Man Goes To War, The Pandorica Opens, The Big Bang, The Impossible Astronaut, and Day of the Moon - all great episodes I'd say.

&gt;how Rivers story was ruined, I felt having her be a companions daughter was a bit lame and now they're trying to make up for it with Clara who is essentially the same basic idea.

It's more important that River is a child of the TARDIS, and less that she's the daughter of a companion. Although I do understand some people did not like that reveal. In her whole storyline she's not defined by being the companions daughter, she's defined by her love for the Doctor, her time lord regenerative powers that she gives up for him, and us knowing her eventual death.  I don't think the show runners had a plot point from series 6 in mind as their motivation for the new companion, and fortunately, both Clara and River are charismatic enough to still be interesting after they are ""revealed"". 

That io9 article is abysmal, and I normally like their write ups.  The author missed major plot points (she didn't understand the fused zombie were the brothers) and hated the episode because she didn't understand it (she thought telling the brothers not to touch each other was a made up ""rule"" for no reason).  She also completely missed that Clara will likely remember the Doctor name, just as the brother remember to be a decent person, so it wasn't a total reboot.  She really missed the boat in that review unfortunately.

That doesn't invalidate your feelings, but if you feel similar to that author, maybe it's because you're missing the intention behind some of the plot points?",0,1367347688,null,0,false,0,c9prcqd,t3_1dewyn,t1_c9prcqd,t3_1dewyn,null,1431370962,22,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,22

    Malicious wounding
    Wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm
    Use of substance or object to endanger life.

So no way is anything GBH or Mal wouding related going to receive a community resolution, so its really just ABH. Some ABHs are actually very minor and really only just above the threshold of common assault. Something like a small cut caused in a scuffle might be ABH. Minor ABHs are a lot more common than GBHs so this is not exactly a huge revelation which should send us all running for the hills.

The driver went through a metal barrier on the upper deck which opened out onto a ""skylight"" for the ground level. The area the car landed is directly in front of the disabled parking and child parking bays so there was a risk of injury or death if a person(s) were to be standing in front of their car on the pathway.

Tesco have already somewhat repaired the barrier by the time i took a trip down (7pm) but the area on the upper deck remains cordoned off.

Overall, there was certainly a risk of further harm to bystanders below but the car landed in a low footfall area in the middle of the ground floor carpark. The barrier that was struck appears to be no different than any other carpark metal railings and other sites in the local area such as [CastlePoint](http://england-visit.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/bournemouth-castlepoint-shopping-centre.html) are no different. The outer walls are much thicker, using bricks about chest height so a forward tap from parked should hold them back. I would presume that the driver swung their car into the bay far too quickly and had enough momentum to push through the black metal ground anchor at the end of the bay and then the barrier.

&gt; I think it's so they appear to be doing something rather than any inclination it'll work. It's another excuse to call jobseekers lazy and fraudulent (unless they're rich enough to not need a job of course) and it's far easier than creating the jobs needed.

Nobody thinks that a successful way to govern a country is not to bother with jobs and just call the out of work lazy. What on earth would that achieve (except getting kicked out at the next election?).

&gt; I know this is controversial but I think the Tories want relatively large unemployment:

Nobody wants that it's bad for everyone.

&gt; The rich/poor gap increases

The Tories dont want a bigger rich and poor gap. If anything they may not really care about it - so long as people are free to get rich it less of a concern if there is a big gao.

&gt; Worker's rights are more easily infringed because of lack of job security

Having a bunch of companies that can't offer job security is a sign of a shit economy. Which nobody wants.

&gt; It gives an amorphous yet large target as a scapegoat and furthermore they [unemployed] do not have the means speaking out against plans

Having a set of people to blame is a very shitty alternative to having people in jobs. 

&gt; JSA is next to nothing in the DWP's budget, let alone the government one so not that much money is being lost.

Its stupid to say that not a lot of money goes on this stuff. The reason why it's an area for action is because its an area that can be tackled (unlike NHS, pensions, education which are obviously not going to magically shrink).

All that has happened here is (as per usual) the government have taken a reasonable idea and cack-handedly implemented it so as to take pretty much all of the value out of it, compounded by a shitty workforce in the DWP. 

Everybody agrees more jobs would really help this whole situation out.

We have no physical players who can dominate there or can distribute precision passing to the attacking third, this is why we are getting dicked in the league absolutely no balance. Aside from Mikel (arguably Luiz) who can play in this position? No one. Lamps is leaving, and Ramires is a box to box midfielder and is wasted in this position.

true,manosdelmuerto,river,River,"The TARDIS exploding is part of one of my Clara theories
the Tardis Explodes again, this causes cracks in time. The TARDIS pulls a Rose and sends a message leading her doctor to her, with a little help from Clara.

Now a Tardis Exploding causes cracks in the universe, we have already fixed the cracks in the universe, but I don't think we have properly identified the cause. They explosion that ends the universe is not the explosion that River Song was Trapped in. That was the TARDIS pulling an emergency protocol sort of thing. With the Universe ending around it the TARDIS went as close to the Doctor as it could to save him, since it could not put the Doctor in the TARDIS because of the Pandorica around him. Instead it went to the sun and exploded itself in a temporal loop. This heated the planet.

Meanwhile the universe ended and Silence fell. Since there was nothing in existence but the earth, nothing was ever there to have built the Trap for the Doctor and eventually that faded. Unfortunately he was too late to restart the universe, it simply took to long for him to get out. The time lord beaten by time. OH hell no

Normally traveling through time is like running across a busy 14 lane free way in the middle of an air raid during and earthquake. There's a lot of stuff going on, which is what makes it so hard. Except now there's no universe to get in the way. Going back in time is crossing a crack in the sidewalk, in the dead of the night. Not much to interfere. Now the Doctor can go back in time, but he can't get himself out, so he goes and gets Rory. And they do the time wibble and They make the Big Bang Now the Universe is Reset and The Doctor is no more, which means that the TARDIS with Clara in it will never explode and The Silence will not fall.

Only he got Amy to Bring him back. And so The Silence tried to kill him. And they failed.

And then He met Oswin and Miss Montegue, who lead him to Clara so that he and Clara can go on their adventures. So that The TARDIS can go an explode once more to set forth the events of series 5. Now all that is left is for him to go and fix the fact that the TARDIS exploded.

In summation of the second because it is bit long and Clara is a normal girl who goes on a trip with The Doctor. Oswin Oswald and Victorian Clara are the TARDIS bleeding through time, taking on images of Clara in order to lead that doctor to Clara so that Their adventures happen to make sure that the TARDIS explodes so that the cracks in series 5 can happen so that the universe can end and be restarted and the Doctor can be remembered so that he can exist to meet Oswin and Clara and be led to Clara so that their adventures can lead to the TARDIS exploding...

Wibbly

but who caused it to explode? Who wants to make sure The Doctor never dies, who would be able to remember him after he was erased? River, because she knows his name and can remember things more personally. She helped Amy bring the Doctor back, since she needed him for her to exist, and she gave Clara his number to make sure he meets her so that their Tardis explodes so that the cracks can form so that the doctor can reset time so that she can be born. If the universe doesn't end and get rebooted then she will never be born and a huge number of paradoxes start happening because she is to tied up in The Doctors timeline.",0,1367352916,null,0,false,0,c9pte3g,t3_1deyvq,t1_c9pte3g,t3_1deyvq,null,1431370003,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

They came at the angle originally from a more philosophic viewpoint, and they studied all the different iterations of virtue ethics from different civilizations to see if they could find any virtues which are prized unanimously by all civilizations. The results were extremely positive in that they were able to isolate quite a few virtues/strengths which exist within all of the societies that they studied.

They used this as a basis to start to see whether there was a correlation between those who we see as 'virtuous' and those who are 'happy' and they found that there was. Like I said, I don't have access to the exact research they used, however, I do remember that Seligman referenced [this](http://www.businessinsider.com/grant-study-reveals-what-makes-us-happy-2013-4) study quite heavily in 'Authentic Happiness'.

Eventually making its way to the maternity ward, where a new child is being born. But there is trouble in the ER the child isn't breathing! The doctors and nurses start emergency CPR to bring the child back to life. The medical staff is working expertly and quickly but with no visible results. The small patch of golden particles hovers momentarily, as if waiting for an opportune moment. After several moments of tense work the medical staff stop working. As the Doctors prepare to announce time of death, mother looking on exhausted and terrified, the golden mist floats down to the baby and up through the nostrils. The lead physician begins to speak but before he can finish the child takes a sharp inhalation and starts crying. The child would be named after the Doctor :)

KDB and Hazard can play on the wings and Hazard is great there, but KDB is simply not a winger, he's played on the wings for Bremen four times this season. Yes, we need better options in central midfield, but to say that's our only problem area is ridiculous, currently we can't rest Hazard and Mata without fielding a line up that struggles against QPR. 

I agree the central midfield position is a problem area right now, but if you really think we should be worrying about FFP then we should be looking to use players we already own. Essien would be great depth and Chalobah is absolutely brilliant, he's definitely ready for the premiership and I'd love to see him playing here next season, we'll also have Romeu back; still I think we should sign another central midfielder, even if we recall Chalobah and Essien, which I doubt we'll do.

Bit short-sighted to say that considering the lack of game time he's had in the first team over the two seasons he's been here. He's had what... ~20 appearances in total. He's not going to adapt immediately if he's not starting on a regular basis.

&gt; Injury Prone

Unfortunately. He's only had the one major injury while he's been here and a few tiny ones at the end of last season. Not sure that makes him entirely injury prone though.

But I do agree with you on the point that we have no physical presence. In fact, I personally think that's the fundamental problem with the team at the moment.

When you have someone who is going to be in lots of episodes, you want to see them develop and grow and feel that you are gradually getting to know them.  This approach doesn't work if they're only going to be in an episode or two where you need them to have maximum impact in a short time.  The latter dictates that their character needs to be somewhat over the top and larger than life but these sort of people rapidly get irritating if you see them all the time.

That's why I don't agree with people who would like Clara to be more like her Victorian counterpart or Oswin because they were written for single episodes and would rapidly become annoying if we were seeing them week in week out.

We have played without proper wingers for the last four years now. That being said a solid DM is integral to how we play. Now why do we struggle against QPR? Not because of a lack of wings, but a lack of creativity and strength in the midfield. We have too many people in the attacking midfield, our squad is not balanced at all. We do not need another winger/attacking midfielder.  If you get a proper DM or Deep Laying play maker (one with foresight and ability to pass) we wont need to depend on Hazard and mata. We can adjust our tactics and have different formations. 

Essien is on his way out and will never be the player he used to be. Sure he is doing decently at Madird, but how will he do back in England? When will be be injured again?

Right, but some people literally can't do any work (disabled etc) and many that are on benefits already have to qualify their use of jobseekers allowance with doing free labour (there was a fuss about a scheme with poundland) and so on.  Is that so different?

As you said, the specifics are indeed important.  My concern is that paying people to do something is not necessarily more productive than doing nothing if the jobs that they find don't need doing or end up replacing people who are employed normally.

Equally, if you get the same amount of money being paid by the government as seeking normal employment, you then have little incentive to stop.  At that point, the government has a lot of people draining cash from it while they do not want to move off this beneficial scheme (for the people) and it is not necessarily getting much benefit from this labour.

true,hotcod,null,null,"The name is the name they would be given regardless, this way they cut it off at the knees. It's also part of the history of the movement and has it's roots in a think tank in Sweden that sprung up in response to an anti-piracy group that used piracy in their name. Piracy was an attempt at framing copyright infringement as akin to stealing by pro copyright lobbyist and there is no better way to deal with that than make it a legitimate movement. Which it is, the Icelandic party just won parliamentary seats.

It shouldn't matter anyway because, as you say, they are a politically narrow party and I don't think that's a bad thing. It may make it hard to win seats in our current system but they are injecting a voice that is largely missing in public discourse.    

&gt;I really dislike some of their opinions on copyright law. They want a maximum 10-year copyright term (reduced to 5 years for closed-source software). To put that in perspective Microsoft's Windows 7 would be public domain next October and Linux Kernel v2.4 backwards would be PD now (for any company to use without giving credit and, more importantly, code back to the community), that just seems mental to me. While lengthening the term to 10 years for open-source works is nice, I don't think it should be up to the government to **incentivise licencing a work under one licence over another**. 

That last point is an interesting one. You could argue the government already incentivise a licence by making copyright something that is automatically assigned at the point of creation of the work under UK law. Under the Statute of Anne (1710), the start of UK copyright law and in fact the base for all modern copyright the right was only assigned at the point of publishing at which it was 14(then later 21 years) plus another 14 if the author was still alive. It worth noting the Statute of Anne was the result of lobbying by publishers, not authors, who had decided they needed a new way to enforce monopoly on printing after the Stationers Guild was broken up. 

The pirate parties terms may seem extreme in terms of the UK historical laws, which are have almost always been longer term but it's based on the idea behind the American system (most based on UK laws of the time) which saw copyright as a trade of a short term monopoly to incentive the creation of work and having that work move in to the public domain. The idea being that copyright is in fact a limiting of people inherent freedoms and if they are being asked to give that freedom up it should be for a return. 7 years with a 7 year extension is how their terms started out, which is largely seen a hugely radical in todays terms because publishers have been pushing the idea that copyright is an inherent personal right (copyright as a common law right was briefly flirted with in this country in 1765 or so thanks to a court case but it was overturned by the lords) because publishers have largely made their money from being assigned those rights and locking up the public good.

As an example the last 100 years are pretty much missing in terms of public domain books. It's only recently with people actively publishing in to the public domain that we've seen levels start to rise. This is a horrid thing in my view. My point is simply that shorter copyright terms may seem crazy to us now but that's because for the last 100 years or so we've seen nothing but the expansion of those terms with almost no debate let alone the kind of public engagement in the topic we are seeing these days. 

The point of all this is that we need to choose what we want copyright law to accomplish and ask ourselves what is the best way of doing that and everything should be on the table as a result. If you think 10 years is crazy find out why people are even suggesting it because in a lot of ways long terms have been accepted just because that's what we've been told we need.

Moffat's tenure as show-runner has featured tremendous inconsistency in the quality of the scripts. Yes, there were bad episodes under RTD. But the series under RTD tended to bat .800 or .900 and even the bad episodes were generally C's. Moffat's series are closer to .500, the bad episodes are frequently D's or F's, and the current series has been truly dreadful in the script-writing department.

I actually found ""Journey to the Center of the TARDIS"" to be a welcome relief because the ending actually proceeded logically out of what had been established over the course of the episode: We knew the button could turn off the magna-tron. We knew that a rip in time was allowing the past, present, and future to freely mix together. Compared to the illogical nonsense found in the conclusions of the last four episode, this was a significant improvement. (Significant problems elsewhere in the script combined with some truly dire choices by the director and editor, unfortunately, still plague the episode.)

I also agree that the execution of the meta-arcs have been very questionable. Series 5 mostly sustained itself by repetitively showing us the same ""spooky"" shot of the crack and occasionally supplemented that with portentous nonsense like ""all I hear is silence"" at the end of ""Vampires of Venice"". I did enjoy ""The Pandorica Opens""/""The Big Bang"" as a conclusion to Season 5: Misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor results in the creation of a broken pocket universe and the Doctor is forced to sacrifice himself in order to reboot the universe, but it turns out he's able to prep a loophole and come back. I thought the method and motive of assassination was clever and well established by the meta-arc of the season; I thought the rules of the pocket universe were clear and interesting; I thought the loophole was played fairly and was also joyfully clever in its execution.

But then we fast forward a season and we find ""The Wedding of River Song"": A misguided assassination attempt on the Doctor results in the creation of a broken pocket universe and the Doctor is forced to sacrifice himself in order to reboot the universe, but it turns out he's able to prep a loophole and come back.

Only this time there is no motive presented for the assassination attempt; the method makes no sense; the pocket universe is a lot of sound and fury without clear or coherent rules to its existence; and the loophole is puerile.

RTD's run was not immune from this ""deja vu decay"" either: A dalek accusing the Doctor of being a good dalek in ""Dalek"" was astonishingly brilliant storytelling that evoked what had happened to the Doctor and how it had changed him. The third or fourth time we came back to the exact same moment with Davros accusing the Doctor of the same thing (only this time in a context for which it made no sense in the middle of a plan to destroy the universe which also made no sense) it had lost all its impact. But this was the major reason I wasn't mournful when RTD left: It was clear he had told all the Doctor Who stories he had to tell.

Finally, we come to Clara: Of the three incarnations we've seen, the decision was somehow made to go with the most bland, vanilla, and uninteresting version of her as the permanent companion. There's nothing about her as an individual which is unique or interesting or anything other than cliche; in fact, she mostly comes across as Companion the Companion. The ""mystery"" surrounding her multiple existences throughout time and space is boring because there are absolutely no stakes attached to it: Yup. It's a weird thing. And I'm mildly curious what the explanation might be. But there's been no reason given for why I should actually care what the explanation is and mild curiosity can't really be effectively sustained across multiple episodes.",0,1367357100,null,0,false,0,c9pv1tq,t3_1dewyn,t1_c9pv1tq,t3_1dewyn,null,1431369207,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

I'd definitely second what others have said - keep a car, live outside the city. Shamefully, I didn't know what the West Cambridge Site area was considered to be, so had to google it myself. Looking at it, you're going to be working about a mile from where I am - I'm down near the Council area/Shire Hall. I bike in currently - it's about 5.5 miles as I'm in Shelford - and it is doable, but it's knackering in shitty weather, and definitely something you need to carefully consider in terms of what your ideal cycling limits would be. 



Like others have said, Trumpington/Cherry Hinton would be do-able areas on the salary you've suggested, but you're right to think realistically about costs of housing. For example, we rented in Cambridge 7 years ago at a cost of £770pm for a two bed terrace just off Mill Road. We now own our house (with mortgage) at currently a really good monthly repayment of £614pm thanks to a decent deposit and good interest rate deals. However, one of our friends rents a one bed flat in Cherry Hinton for just under £1000pm, so property prices for both purchasing and renting can vary massively - you'll always get more for your money a few miles from the city centre though. 


Going out can be pricy, but it depends what you want to do. As other have said, definitely keep a car if you can; we rented in a village called Haslingfield when we first moved into the area. It was beautiful and quaint and lovely, but it was also nearly 7 miles from my work, and at the time I couldn't drive. On rainy days, if I bussed in, I had to make sure I got the 5pm bus home because that was the last one. Buses - especially out to the villages - can be really haphazard in terms of some timetabling!

Which countries do you consider are following a Keynesian stimulus at the moment?

Our economy is flat lining and showing no signs of recovery, austerity isn't working here.

&gt;You can't borrow money, and squander it, you have to get a good return on the investment. Paying people to do something which doesn't make more money will result in either inflation or a bigger debt. Neither are good.

Firstly, there wasn't a suggestion that any additional money should be borrowed but more taxes should be raised instead.

Then we randomly introduce a corporation named Bad Wolf. The words Bad Wolf could have been anything, the plot would have been exactly the same if they were ""cotton candy red,"" as long as Davies randomly brought up a space station named ""Cotton Candy Red"" station.  If the words Bad Wolf had not appeared in any episodes until that point, nothing would have changed in the plot in any way

It wasn't a season story at all, all plot development begins and ends in the finale.  Then the episode just goes into full ""make it up as you go along"" mode, giving Rose godlike powers from the TARDIS vortex and she goes and fixes everything.  Deus ex machina is one of the weakest plot devices, and this is the prototypical deus ex machina cop out.  *Rose literally turned into a god out of the machine*.  

Season 2 was alright.

Season 3 finale was also a deus ex machina cop out, with everybody thinking about the Doctor really hard and the satellites link them so the Doctor is invincible and god out of the blue and everything is okay again.  But maybe I'm biased; I can't stand Martha for some reason.

Season 4 finale was kinda a deus ex machina too, but less so.  Still, she touched his hand which had regeneration so when she got shocked she suddenly knew everything he did kinda feels like another cop out.  But I think this one was more about the Doctor getting closure with Rose, and while I don't like that if that was Davies's goal, sacrificing plot strength for character development is a reasonable thing to do in some situations.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;Personally I would prefer simply a higher tax on the richest, whether their income is through wages or capital gains.

Higher than 50p?  I agree in CGT, but I'm in favour of abolishing CT because it doesn't bloody work, having VAT on more things that are currently excluded (ie sandwiches from pret) and CGT becoming the same as income tax.... That's a different rant, and I say this as a business owner who would *loose out*.  However I think more than 50p is kinda stupid, no one will pay it.  You only have to earn £80k+ a year to be targeted by people advertising EBTs and the like (think jimmy car), once your at £500k you have far too many options to avoid taxing the whole income.  Who would feel guilty paying £50k tax bill, when you consume no public services?  People dodge it is the reality, in life one thing I've found is those who claim they don't dodge it the most, see Guardian and AutoTrader.......

&gt;Which countries do you consider are following a Keynesian stimulus at the moment? Most countries are having some kind of austerity, those with the deepest cuts are suffering with the weakest economies.

Well it depends what you mean by Keynesian stimulus, I would describe Greece as one of the biggest followers of it over the last 30 years, they employed people on high wages to do jobs which didn't deliver value.

I would suggest that if there are jobs which can be done by someone, which add value (ie produce more than the cost of employing people) why aren't private enterprises doing it!  Maybe because the upfront investment requirement is too high, but that only effects a tiny minority of these projects.

&gt;Firstly, there wasn't a suggestion that any additional money should be borrowed but more taxes should be raised instead. If there were a need for more borrowing, you need to make sure that whatever work you have people doing pays off more than the approx 1% that it costs for the government to borrow. Improving the infrastructure of the country, roads, rail and broadband, would provide a boost to the economy and surely pay off in the long term.

This is what is normally referred to as return on investment, the fact is that unless you are able to generate true value from the productivity of the person you are paying, you loose money (debt or inflation).  So the question is what is it that you could employ people to do that add long term value?  I think cross-rail is a good example of something that will eventually do so.  As a keen cyclist and someone who finds driving boring (I even drive an eco diesel!) you can I trust understand I'd love to be saying we should be building new infrastructure, mass transit, cycle infrastructure, as a programmer, I can probably better describe the benefits of broadband on commerce than most..... However, we're in deficit.  If we had swapped out Labour in 2000 for the Tories, it would be great to have some spending types in power now.  Sadly we have had chronic reckless spending, which is unsustainable, the proof is, in effect, the state of economic situation now.

So then it comes down to the simple, do we take a very mild pain now, do we try and avoid it by borrowing more?  Get it right and brilliant, mild pain avoided, get it wrong and much, much worse.

The issue is people always pick and choose their examples, is the massive government employee system of Greece Keynesian?  I don't know.  Get Keynes in this thread and he'd probably give us two opinions ;)",0,1367358589,null,0,false,0,c9pvlrk,t3_1df2hy,t1_c9pvlrk,t1_c9pvbe2,null,1431368945,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I never claimed they were. I was pointing out that you can be sent to prison for making a tweet, therefore it's not that hard to be sent down.

&gt;Most people are there for commuting crimes that hurt others, whether directly or indirectly.

Source?

&gt;And yes, shoplifting is a crime. You're stealing something which belongs to others and ends up costing law abiding people more money since the store loses out. Why do you feel that its a crime undeserving of punishment?

I didn't say it wasn't a crime. I just couldn't give a shit if some homeless person steals a loaf of bread from a multinational corporation that makes millions in profits. I don't think that makes them a scumbag, I think that makes them desperate. The reason some people are in that situation in the first place is because some people think their profits are more important than the populaces welfare. They're the real scumbags.

There's plenty of laws I think are complete bullshit and should be scrapped, so obviously I don't think people should be punished for breaking them. Do you agree with all our current laws? I bet everyone has broken numerous laws on many occasions and would argue that they shouldn't be punished for doing so because those laws are bullshit. Copyright infringement being a major example.

&gt;For most minor crimes, you don't go to prison for your first offence. Hell, even burglars and muggers aren't always given prison sentences. 

That's true, most of the time. Doesn't change the fact though that people can be sent to prison for crimes they didn't commit or things that shouldn't even be crimes in the first place. Nor just it change the fact that you can be sent to prison for simply saying the wrong thing.

I reckon it could go one of two ways:

**Tight affair** (0-0, 1-0 either way) - Since both teams want to be in the game while watching for other results, and neither team has been playing well recently, this is most likely. I was at Millwall and we weren't very good, but we stood up to them physically and hopefully we'll have gained some confidence from that. Leicester have been terrible but they'll be fired up, the manager's job and several player contracts are riding on it.

After a long time of trying to justify piracy to myself, I can't find a good reason that I should really be allowed to pirate things. I don't like equating it to theft - it isn't theft, it's copying - but people need to accept that it's not really ethical to duplicate other people's creations.

I do worry, though, that lawmakers look at current copyright law and see it as Something That Must Be Indiscriminately Enforced. It needs to be reformed so that it serves its original purpose - protecting artists and creators from companies who want to take their work and making a profit off it without their involvement. Strangely, the government doesn't seem all too concerned about this particular aspect of copyright.

My main fear that the enforcement of copyright will become *too good* at the expense of other freedoms and common sense. I don't want the HTML5 standard sullied by non-interoperable DRM binaries. I want to be able to exercise the discretion that I can probably torrent Age of Mythology or perform the song Happy Birthday without really hurting anyone.

If enforcement of copyright laws became perfect, it would be a tragedy. This is what's going on with patents in the USA at the moment: you can't open a technology startup without exposing yourself to massive lawsuits. There is no application of discretion or being reasonable about things. It's all about technicalities and exacting application of the law by suing everyone you can find. [This is genuinely a thing](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/patent-trolls-want-1000-for-using-scanners/).

How do you protect creativity without ruining society? I have no idea. It's clear that the current situation isn't really working out though.

Edit: /u/hotcod's comment has just reminded me of the attempts at extending copyright over ludicrous periods of time. That is bad. Nothing from the 1930s should be in copyright. No other industry gets to make money just because they came up with something in the 1930s.

Car parks turned into homes, shops or green spaces. Residential areas reclaimed for people and leisure, rather than cars. Improved battery tech should come along at the same time, so they'll absolutely be electric. Cleaner city air. Potential for batteries to charge at night and/or balance the grid at times of excess renewables production. Reduced foreign oil dependance. 

Massively improved transport options for people not old enough/not able enough/not sober enough to drive. 

Improved productivity, instead of a stressful commute every morning you can use the time to catch up on some e-mails, or finish that book. 

Improved road safety, these systems will be far better at spotting pedestrians and cyclists.

And most favorite? For a long time I really loved Amy. It might have been because I actually found her terribly attractive, look and personality, even in real life. But she ended up being pretty self centered later on. Rory, now that's my man. He really went all out for Amy, and even for the doctor. Amy acted as though everything she went through was so much worse than what Rory had gone through, but honestly, Rory got the short end throughout.. I really like that guy.

true,LooksLikeANewAccount,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"Sorry I'm late on this but I might be able to help.

Assume we have 10 companies (1 supermarket, 1 construction company etc) each employing 7 people (from CEO to cleaner). Our total population is 100. (We have 70% employment)

We want more people to be employed but our companies wont make profit off employing extra people.

We can try a few things.

* Print money and give it to the unemployed. This will seem like a good idea because now our unemployed people have money! Firms see this and realise they can charge more cash and still achieve the same demand. This is inflation. More money but it's worth less. Our workers' salaries are worth less than they used to be, but our unemployed dudes can now eat. Inflation can spiral out of control crippling an economy. This is generally seen as a shit idea.

* Make the government buy stuff from companies so they need more workers to keep up. Alternatively, borrow money for benefits which will create the demand. Workers become employed, they now have jobs and their salaries replace the demand that the government was creating. The government now has debt to pay off. This was a traditional 'Kenysian' (Named after the famed economist John Maynard Kenyes) solution. Clear pros and cons.

* Tax the workers more, give the money to the unemployed. This is similar to the first point, we're making the workers worse off and the unemployed better off. Only this way we don't have hyper-inflation. Our workers might seem a bit peeved considering they are working hard and now getting less, they might even (being the majority) vote in a party who will stop this from happening. 

* Reduce the costs workers inflict on firms. Now the benefit they will give the company is greater than the cost they present. This is done by lowering minimum wage, reducing workers' rights (e.g. health and safety). Maybe more people become employed but the working/living conditions deteriorate.

* Give the unemployed people more skills so they are more effective workers. This may now mean that the revenue the companies would gain from employing them is now greater than the cost of employing them. This usually costs the government money in higher education budgets etc. though there have been ideas (such as the scheme OP was in) to move on these costs to the private sector. Everyone is happy!

So we have, give away money, borrow cash, redistribute wealth, lower business costs, increase business revenue. 

While many people use political ideology as a shield, almost all parties agree that they need to use almost all of these strategies.

I can give examples of both Labour and the Lib/Cons using at least one policy from each category. 

I might have over simplified things for you, I don't know if you're a GCSE student or a professor of economics.

EDIT: To link this to your comment, it isn't about fitting 120 workers in 100 jobs. It's about creating new jobs. That maths works out quite well.

true,TheEvilScotsman,scottish,Scotland,"I wouldn't call what the Greeks had as Keynes-based. Seems like a lot of their government jobs were sinecures, with an inappropriately low level of government investment as they were safe in the confidence that as members of the Eurozone their industry (largely German-owned) would never be flat for capital. This would be a rather facile description of the Keynesian argument.

This isn't to say Keynes is perfect, but his economic theory is largely that it is possible to have near full employment (with an unemployment rate of about 2% or so) with government investment in profitable industries or in infrastructural construction. There are of course limitations to this, such as the difficulty of ensuring the profitability of companies and their competitiveness when they are receiving government money - which can skew how profitable businesses actually are since they view government investment as something permanent, and hence become uncompetitive. The issue with infrastructure projects too is that there is only so much infrastructure that is needed, it would be folly to constantly build highways or railway lines if these are not going to be long-term profitable investments, and there is the chance of mismanagement in this area.

This all being said; a flagging economy, which is losing out in many areas to foreign competition, where the movement of industrial goods proves prohibitively expensive because of poor infrastructure, could benefit inordinately from some choice application of Keynesian stimulus. Careful planning of infrastructural developments based on need can improve the productivity and profitability of industry, and with effectively lowered transport costs there is more money available either for innovation or an expanded workforce. A key benefit of a more employed workforce too is that this increases the base of consumers, with the concurrent benefits this affords retail. Feeding back into the economy and providing growth.

Of course, this is an ideal application of Keynes and such efficiency is rarely met. ",0,1367365885,null,0,false,0,c9py6hv,t3_1df2hy,t1_c9py6hv,t1_c9pvlrk,null,1431367732,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Blink is a very nice stand-alone episode, though it doesn't necessarily represent the series as a whole, especially since it is a 'Doctor-lite' episode.

You could have a look at http://fixato.org/files/drwho/WhoEpisodes.txt which was mostly a guide for my partner to catch up on some Doctor Who by listing the (imho) most important episodes.

With regards to the 9th Doctor, ""The Empty Child"" is still one of my favourite episodes.
Bad Wolf / Parting of Ways is pretty good too, but you kinda need the backstory of the rest of the season for that imho.

Blink, ""School Reunion"", ""The Impossible Planet"", ""Human Nature"", ""Silence in the Library"" are sort of my favourite 10th Doctor episodes.

**In general:**

every Doctor is different. We all have our favourite and least-favourite actors, and some people just can't stand certain actors. Pick some episodes of every Doctor and form your own opinion. :)

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"&gt;denying civil rights to a people is not cool and has consequences. naked sectarianism and bigotry is another thing altogether.

Apart from not being totally convinced marriage is a human or civil right, I'm having a hard time reconciling this vision of liberal values that you're trying to describe which is inclusive of 'naked sectarianism and bigotry'. This is my goat with LBGT proponents who are so blind due to their own narrow mindedness that they cannot see the faultlines in their argument that SF are 'liberal' because 'they back ussuns'.

Tell me how such an argument is any different to a nat/loyalist from blaming everything on themmuns without considering the others pov?

What is the relevance of the above point? Well, if you believe that marriage rights should be extended to non-heterosexuals I would advise you on approaching those DUP/UUP/whoever supporting liberals that aren't really that fussed with something more subtle than ""YOU'RE ALL CALEB-SUPPORTING PARIAHS FROM THE 1950s"".

That way, you might actually begin to change mindsets from the ground up. If you don't, you'll be spouting the perma-rage for a few more years yet.
