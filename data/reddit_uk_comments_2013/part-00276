Basically it's a series of photographs and you have two hours to find as many as you can and take a team picture in that spot.

Edit: I'll try and dig it out. It's a pretty big file though so I might have to make a lengthy Imgur album of it so bear with me. If we actually do this I volunteer to administrate it because obviously I know where they all are. There are a few rules as well (like you can use any form of transport that isn't privately owned - no cars or bikes but buses and taxis are acceptable, and all team members but the one taking the picture must be in each shot to count, teams must be roughly even sized). I seem to remember there are maybe 30+ places to find and it's not really possible to do all of them in the time limit unless you happen to be a ninja with an encyclopaedic knowledge of Bristol. It could also be expanded if someone else wanted to team up with me and add some more images over other areas, say Stokes Croft or Cotham.

We could make it so it's something like £2 entry per person, winning team(s) splits the pot and we give a percentage to charity.

If you want the western equivalent then consider the people in their youth who get into shit like radical socialism or the animal liberation front. A few of these people will end up like Breivik or McVeigh, that's the white version.
These people are radicals who think they're a precious snowflake that has been bestowed with the right to change the world. They then find a narrative and an identity (downtrodden Muslim in this case) that fits with that.

The narrative here is the narrative of the Arab people following the dismantling of the Ottoman empire.

Fans booed after being thrashed on aggregate 11-0 by 2 of the teams that we should be competing with. That booing was justified. It is not being entitled to expect more than the garbage we rolled out in those games.

true,GlassesAndMoustaches,logo4,,"I'm guessing you're a City fan and therefore plan on visiting the Etihad. However if you want to see a different team then follow /u/megage_a_un's advice.

For City, well the best thing to do is become a member on the website. From there you'll get a slight pre-release on match tickets which will give you an advantage on most other people. Champions league tickets you may as well rule out, you'll get zero chance of seeing City and Barca at the Etihad - you will need x amount of membership points to score tickets.

As for premier league you may be able to get tickets to some of the lower end fixtures but don't get your hopes up on seeing Chelsea get thrashed when they visit us. That'll be a tough game to get into. 

You could try some FA cup matches. I know people who aren't members yet managed to get tickets to them and they're fairly cheap. Don't forget if you're in London you'll have to pay for the train to Manchester, the tram to the Etihad, lunch, a few drinks and the train back. So the cost can quickly add up.

If you can't make the matches then go for the next best thing - watch them at a pub. Try to find a City pub in the area you're in and make the most of it. It's a lot different to how Americans' (I'm going off what I've seen in films here) watch sport in bars.

My uni doesn't even require previous IT qualifications to enter the IT courses.; it's the ability to study at that level that is required. 

Something to bear in mind with IT courses is that everyone I know who has done one complains that they spend time being taught stuff they already know...  but they often forget that they have detailed knowledge in a specific area, and they may not know anything about, say, database programming theory or planning for business integration. 

If you have only practical experience, I suggest making sure you have your level 2 (GCSE) English and maths and then speaking to the course advisors and tutors at local colleges and universities. Their are vocational - focused courses that can build from a low level all the way to a degree level...  but availability and course structure varies so much that I can't really advise further.  Just remember ; universities value someone having BTEC diploma / a level quals,  as it demonstrates study skills.  That and the aforementioned maths and GCSE basics are what you need...  and what's worth sticking out a crap year in college for.

It sounds like the relationship between AVB and the club was broken and despite efforts by Baldini/Levy/others and conversely AVB making an effort with the club it didn't seem to be getting better, i totally understand that in that circumstance both sides basically decided that it was time to walk away (Jason Burt's article alludes that all sides were worn out with the situation and both agreed to end it).  Fair enough.

However, i just would love to know if there was a plan.  Given the year, and specifically the time of year (WC in the summer and mid-season for most of the European leagues) most managers that people would consider to be potential targets are understandably occupied with an existing job.  

Add to that it seems like we kinda went to Sherwood and were asked if he would be willing to do the job short term.

Well, what the hell was the plan?  shouldn't we have been inquiring with some managers representation ahead of time? Shouldn't there be conversations with clubs about potentially buying out their manager?  Shouldn't there be a sense of urgency surrounding the club to let everyone know (players/coaches/fans/staff/etc) what is going on?

Suarez contract talks are private. Says nice things about Suarez and that he would like to build team around him for years to come.

Lots of talk about the good atmosphere and the improving quality of football at the club.

Journalist forgets to mention Joe Allen when talking about midfield so BR corrects him and then waxes lyrically about Allen.

Goes on to say the midfield three against Tottenham were great, but Gerrard makes Liverpool a better team.

He says Liverpool have a relatively small squad. Repeats that players being bought will have to be better than what we already have and there is no pressure or need to loan or sell.

Repeats the talk about Tan that has been reported elsewhere. Includes small self-promotion by mentioning Cardiff are the second team from Wales to make it to the PL!

BR says Flanagan isn't a surprise as he's seen his attitude in training for so long and that he's very happy with him.

Agrees that Cardiff are dangerous at set pieces, but doesn't really answer question about whether that's a worry to a Liverpool side that struggles to defend them.

After the Tan and AVB debacles he says he is happy with FSG and his decision to come to Liverpool. Says FSG have a strategy, and the confidence to allow time for the strategy to develop.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"Yeah, some of the conspiracy blogs turned out to be right about Saville being a paedo, this is because they have named EVERYONE IN THE PUBLIC EYE as being paedos. Because that's what they do. 

There is nothing stopping me right now (apart from a basic working knowledge of libel law and common sense) from publishing a blog post saying that everyone in this thread is a regular visitor to a children's home for sex crime reasons - and I could sprinkle some facts over the top - like the fact that reddit got in trouble for users exchanging CP a few years ago - and the fact that children's homes have been linked to abuse in the past - and maybe one of you has a Jim'll fix it badge - 
and hey presto I'll have convinced conspiracy land and that blog post would then be used as 'source evidence' for fly-by-night 'news sites' like this one.  

And why mention that someone has 'shared a platform' with someone as if that's meant to mean they are somehow part of a conspiracy? Is Douglas Murray an Islamist because he's been on the same Question Time episode as Anjem Choudry? 

And yes Liberty has spoken up for the rights of awful people, they campaign against  stuff like the death penalty and torture around the world - that means some times they have campaigns on behalf of nasty serial killers and terrorists and all sorts. This doesn't mean they endorse their life style choices. 

It's amazing how people remember the Saville is a paedo allegations from David Icke and Angrifaan (usually the primary sources for these kind of sites) and then say these sites are credible - forgetting the lizard-aliens stuff and the fact these sites feel the need to inform us if anyone is SHOCK HORROR Jewish or Catholic. 

Even if this was 90% true - it is NOT OK to spread rumours about even one innocent person because they happen to have been a patron of the same charity or a member of the same dining club as a criminal. 

We do not have guilt by association in this country, we do not conduct trial by media, we do not publish allegations against people unless we can back up those allegations. 

How many people here have expressed sympathy for Ian Watkins band mates recently? You don't assume they must have known everything because they were in the same band yet people assume people must have known what Cyril Smith was up to because they are part of the same political party.. 


Compare this to the excellent documentary on Saville produced by Mark Williams-Thomas, who has a background in policing. 

He corroborated and cross checked details of witness statements 

He didn't assume anyone knew anything - he let them reveal their knowledge or otherwise themselves 

He kept his investigation close to his chest and didn't leak anything - he didn't broadcast until he was sure of his facts 

He let victims and witness speak for themselves

Some friends wanted to get me more into watching it regularly, and being Barcelona fans that's what I originally saw. But to be honest, the first games I watched that got me excited about the sport were those of the German national squad, which led me to get into the Bundesliga (I ended up choosing Bayern due to not only accessibility of information but also because so many of my favorite German players play for them. People may call me a glory hunter, but this before the treble and picked them because of the players, not because they were so good). I'm also of German heritage so that all had an appeal to me. 

Eventually I got sick of friends talking about PL stuff, and me being lost since I didn't follow it, so I decided to look into it. I automatically ruled out Chelsea and Man U because fuck those guys. I eventually narrowed it down to Spurs, Liverpool, and Man City. So I watched games from all of them, threw out Man City, and watched more of Liverpool and Spurs. I just loved seeing Spurs play, I looked up a handful of old matches and watched those, looked at the fan base, I for some reason loved the name ""White Hart Lane"" and that their crest is different than the other clubs. I basically decided on Spurs shortly before that horrific Bayern/Chelsea CL final, which cemented my hatred for Chelsea since it boned both Bayern and my newly adored club Tottenham.

Long story short, I chose Spurs as my English club because I fell in love with their history and watching them play.  ",0,1387486122,null,0,false,0,ce5sc4w,t3_1t7vc2,t1_ce5sc4w,t1_ce5ocbp,null,1428062874,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Not only is Private Eye the target of litigation by wealthy tycoons and politicians, but we're probably more aware of it because the Eye has less budget and is more vulnerable to bankruptcy when it's sued.

""I talk about the Scouts because they are real world examples of when relying on donated services isn't enough. It is not hard to see why a charity can't rely on donated services, and as such can't rely on the printing company you mentioned. Let alone when they are printing on the scale of the three large charities you opened with"" 

Scouts can't rely on only donations (which they never did anywhere) hence no other charity can? Extrapolation much?


""I didn't question whether you watched the video, just the parts you focused on. As for that Ted talking being preaching to the converted, seeing as I was on the fence on the subject at the time of first viewing it, that simply isn't true. Perhaps preaching to the open minded?""

That's your opinion, think what you like.

""I never said that. I only mentioned businesses in the context of the organisations donating services, I at no point compared a charity to a business, though I suspect you mention that because you have had that said to you by other people or perhaps it was in the video.

""The scale of all markets, including the charitable ones, have changed completely in that time anyway. That would be like saying why don't banks operate without computers seeing as they managed it in the 60s. The world is different, and we only need to deal with the requirements of the world we live in.""

And I'm saying the scale has increased because of some charities doing more harm than good. I started supporting Traidcraft over 20 years ago after a horrendous case of a charity getting an asian country to ban children from working in clothing factories, which then caused a massive spike in child prostitution as the families suddenly lost a lot of income.

""There are incentives of course, no one can deny that. It is, unfortunately, competitive. People have to decide where their money (and time) go, not just between charities but all over. Do I need another Xbox game or is there some way I can help the world instead?

Donating isn't in the blood. Although I would be interested in reading an article on genetic philanthropy. What I would say is, in a more Darwinian sense, in the blood is self preservation""

Darwin said that we are successful because we've outsmarted evolution in that respect e.g. altruism. You're being too dismissive of other ways of raising money.

""You know what, as a left leaning person so am I. Unfortunately that is the world we live in. You don't think money helps?""

If raising that money involves harming people and causing them to require help then no.

""Next time there is a tsunami I challenge you to maximise the saving of lives without any money.""

I think you'll find the public donated a fuckton of money when that happened.

""Lets cure cancer without test tubes (I am sure I simplified it again) And with scientists that won't get paid if their company isn't the one to patent the cure.""

I refer you to my previous comment on that. 

""Money may be annoying, but if you are denying the need for it then I haven't got a clue where you are coming from even if the way that money was raised has negative consequences."" 

Right, there we are, you think it's ok even if there are negative consequences and I don't.  

""You are still yet to demonstrate this other than vague comments about charities investing in arms dealers. Please tell me the negative consequences of the mailouts you received.""

Nice merging of two separate points. You've already acknowledge money may have been raised with negative consequences. If you're such an expert on charitable income then you've surely kept up with what the Archbishop of Canterbury thinks about it. Negative consequences of getting mailouts? Remember that tsunami you mentioned? That little thing? The money I donated got partially spent on sending me paper. 

""It annoyed you? (I have already acknowledged they should have obeyed your wishes when opting out anyway)""

Yes it did, so I went and posted on AskUK and got a great suggestion of where else to send my money.

""If you hadn't opted out? 

The only possible negative consequence are with occasional individuals refusing to donate any more. ""

Yes who cares about that when there's hedge fund money invested in oppressive regimes to buoy them up.

""People are rarely that spiteful. ""Lets let people die because we got a piece of paper""?""

How about ""let people die because we've got mailshots to do.""

""And more are gained than are lost.""

Oh yeah?

""The simple fact is, you would barely know about the work of many of these organisations if their work wasn't publicised on one level or another. The Red Cross maybe, they get international new coverage for the disaster relief work (because the disaster is exciting, not the work of the Red Cross). Interestingly not for the local work they do.

Perhaps because our secular punishes them if they try that shit?  In countries with Sharia, or law heavily influenced by Islam, sectarian murder on a large scale is pretty common. See Syria, Iraq, Somalia... 

&gt;Nutella as an example because they're essentially putting their own causes to the name of something completely unrelated.

This is a ridiculous comparison, and I'm sure you know it really. Religion is *interpreted* bullshit.  That means anyone can say Islam means anything they like to them, and they'll be able to justify it with reference to the text.  To continue your silly example; Nutella on the other hand has a definite, empirically testable, composition that cannot be different however much someone would like it to be.  You can't *interpret* Nutella to make it whatever you want.  It's a piece of piss to do this with religious texts.

Montoya: Glenjo is getting old.  Montoya can also play LB when Enrique is out (honestly I think he could well just straight up take the starting spot from him) too.  Great young player.

Xabi Alonso: I want his beard inside me.  And since I can't have that, I'll settle for seeing him in a Liverpool shirt again.  In reality this one's a bit tough... he's an absolutely incredible player but scooping him up and then starting him regularly goes a bit against the way we're trying to build right now.  I also don't think it's possible for him, Lucas, and Gerrard to be playing in the middle at the same time as it would be the worlds most static and immobile midfield ever.  We have mobility/athleticism issues with just Lucas/Gerrard at the moment.  That said the feels compel me to scream that we need him.

Raul Garcia: Superb midfielder and currently in his prime.  I know we like younger players but he's really good and we could do with some reinforcements through the middle.  He chips in with some goals too, especially this season.

All objects and their interactions exert a distorting effect on the fabric of spacetime. Some interactions result in greater distortions than others, even when the immediate result is very small - So, shooting a rifle at a rifle range has a smaller distorting effect than John Wilkes Booth shooting Lincoln, for example. The former was merely incidental, but the latter shaped the history of a nation.

Now, think of how you would pilot any kind of vehicle where you set the controls and wait: You point it in a direction, and tell it how far to go. This is a vector.

This spacetime vector intersects with all the intervening times, places, and events - but since you're in the vortex, traveling to the future might take you through the past within the vortex. You won't necessarily land there, but it might be on your way, so to speak.

Now, imagine for a moment that you're playing miniature golf, but you're viewing the course from directly above, with only a 2D view. You can't see any of the dips and hills. You plan a vector for your ball, hit it, and those unseen distortions in the terrain alter the trajectory of your ball.

Timelords would, of course, account for this in TARDIS designs - there's likely some component buried deep within which is essentially a Vector Drift Compensator, specifically for the purpose of keeping your course straight and true. After all, most timelords don't seem to have trouble with arriving where they meant to be - but the Doctor stole Marnel's TARDIS from a repair bay. It's cobbled together, and has been blown up, flooded, burnt, and who knows what else countless times - Sexy's probably forgotten a fair chunk of the things she was built to do.

So, no Vector Drift Compensator. The TARDIS trajectory passes through events with a large enough distortion on spacetime and falls in. Vworp vworp revolution. Vworp vworp alien invasion. Vworp vworp twisted experiment which threatens the whole of reality, etc. Perfectly natural.",0,1387491028,null,0,false,0,ce5umgu,t3_1t9mkv,t1_ce5umgu,t1_ce5qauu,null,1428061807,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,nunnible,null,null,"&gt; Scouts can't rely on only donations (which they never did anywhere) hence no other charity can? Extrapolation much?

I included the reasons scout can't rely on donations from profit making companies. That an organisation who can spend may come along and make an offer too good to be refused.

&gt; That's your opinion, think what you like.

My opinion yes. I was just demonstrating an extension of your opinion that the video is little more than preaching to the converted.

&gt; And I'm saying the scale has increased because of some charities doing more harm than good. I started supporting Traidcraft over 20 years ago after a horrendous case of a charity getting an asian country to ban children from working in clothing factories, which then caused a massive spike in child prostitution as the families suddenly lost a lot of income.

How is this relevant to administrative costs? That is an operational costs. Which is precisely what you think a charity should be spending money one (In fairness it was also a political move, which you are against charities having but that is different)

&gt; Darwin said that we are successful because we've outsmarted evolution in that respect e.g. altruism. You're being too dismissive of other ways of raising money.

I am yet to dismiss any form of raising money for charities in this debate. I simply don't think we can rely on them.

&gt; If raising that money involves harming people and causing them to require help then no.

Still waiting for proof of this.

&gt; ""Money may be annoying, but if you are denying the need for it then I haven't got a clue where you are coming from even if the way that money was raised has negative consequences.""

&gt; Right, there we are, you think it's ok even if there are negative consequences and I don't. 

Blatant misquote. 

Please don't add your words to the end of my sentences. You even deleted a full stop.

&gt; Nice merging of two separate points. You've already acknowledge money may have been raised with negative consequences. 

No I haven't, that was a misquote

&gt; If you're such an expert on charitable income then you've surely kept up with what the Archbishop of Canterbury thinks about it. 

I am not an expert. But I had a quick google using the phrase ""Archbishop of Canterbury fundraising""

The top results were the previous guy being involved in fundraising events, Canterbury cathedrals fundraising page, and the new guy talking about wonga. Please enlighten me

&gt; Negative consequences of getting mailouts? Remember that tsunami you mentioned? That little thing? The money I donated got partially spent on sending me paper. 

Which generated more income. Meaning that they could help more people. What a terrible outcome

And, your money probably wasn't spend on that. If you donated to an appeal it would have gone to the appeal. The marketing budget would have come out a more general pot that would have been there either way.

&gt; Are you really, seriously, SERIOUSLY telling me Oxfam and Save the Children are not well known, not major figures? Seriously? You have got to be joking. That's like saying no-one knows who Madonna is. 

They are well known, because they market. Does Madonna not spend money on publicity?

&gt; You are all over the place. What specific point are you trying to make? 

I am not all over the place. I responded point by point to what you wrote. But my overall point is simple.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We live in a world (unfortunately) where money is important.

Charities need money to function.

Charity marketing generates income. 

This is a net gain. (Income generated &gt; Marketing expenditure)

This is an investment. This means that, in simple terms. Your donation helps 50 people rather than 5.

However they should respect requests to not receive mail

Anyway these travellers stayed there for about 4 weeks and cleaned up that part of the river by taking away all the scrap metal and shit that had been by the chavs and actually made that area look nice for once.
I remember one woman carved wooden mushrooms everyday and then sold them at garden centres, rest of them seemed to spend the rest of day just chilling out (this was in late June/early July). 

They were a really nice bunch of people who when they left had made the area look a lot better than it was when they arrived. Also had a decent campfire with them one night which was a good laugh. As I said these weren't the travellers I hear about all the time and were more or less 20 or so pretty happy potheads. Ever since they stayed there not a single car has been burnt-out nor any fly-tipping occurred; just before they left they blocked off the end of the road with a giant oak branch so that if someone did drive down there it would still be in full view of the nearby cottage. Generally just a welcoming group who genuinely cared where they were staying.

true,RabidRaccoon,cnty-expat,Expat,"&gt; I loathe the monarchy. They are fawned over endlessly by morons and do nothing of value except titillate said morons. 

When there's a General Election the Monarch calls the leaders of the political parties in order of decreasing popularity and asks them to form a government. Now you'll say ""but we could have a President instead and he'd do the same thing"". Problem with that is that - unlike a Monarch - a President is a politician and there's always a risk that they'd inject their political biases into the process. 

So the Monarch is really a placeholder as Head of State because they're apolitical and the point is that you don't want someone political in that position. Maybe the post election thing could be done by an elected President but what about the rest of it? The Monarch has enormous reserve powers that are never used. Should a President have those powers? What's to stop President Blair from pulling the plugs on Cameron and Clegg by dissolving Parliament when Labour could win, or the political mirror image of that? What about the cohabitation problem where a President from one party has a PM of another and they fight over legislation? A President would have the power to veto laws and he/she would always be tempted to use it.

You could say that the US and France seem to manage OK, but do the really? I think the UK's system is much more lightweight and adaptable. Really it is a way to give an enormous amount of power to the leader of a party that won an election - enough to implement that party's manifesto in full. It can also take it away very quickly if that leader becomes an electoral liability for his or her party as happened to both Blair and Thatcher. In a system which has a separation of powers - an elected President, an elected Parliament and maybe an elected House of Lords it seems that no one has that power. The US and France have a tradition of a powerful President, but those Presidents have far less power than a British PM. They don't get to implement their manifesto in full. In fact look at Obama - his performance at implementing the policies he was elected on is not really very impressive.

If you were designing a constitution from scratch I don't think you'd end up with anything like the UK, but that doesn't meant that retrofitting bits of Americana to the UK is going to make things any better. It could easily make things even more dysfunctional than they are at present.

I firmly believe that the boys would of continued to get better and better as combinations developed throughout the season (my only real gripe with AVB was that he was probably trying too hard to keep the boys ""fresh"" and rotated the squad a bit too much)

I think a Europa League spot would be where we were at, especially the way Liverpool and Everton have been going. Although you'd have to expect them to both hit a bit of a bump at some stage due to injury or form slumps, and if that happened then 4th was still a possibility.

Personally I think the signings we made over the summer gave us a higher ceiling, but also with so many we had that lower floor for this season.

At the end of the day, after 16 games last season we had 8 wins 2 draws and 6 losses (25 points) this season we're 8 wins, 3 draws and 5 losses (27 points) this is why I say that while we haven't been playing great football and have had some terrible losses, we're not in as bad a position as everyone thinks.

* Some pictures are definitely worth posting and enjoyable to watch. For example how Stamford Bridge looked like. I know a lot of you have seen this, but it's still something nice to see. Someone here posting about the scarf picture. Okay, I agree, the scarf picture is worthless. We all know what a Chelsea scarf looks like. However, this post was not about the picture, but about the sale of it on ebay for a charity. OP wants to donate money and shares it with us, why not?  

* Karma whoring can be easily avoided by only allowing pictures as self-posts (i.e. make a self-post and link the image in the post). Voting system should take care of the rest.

* Having daily discussion about a single football club is hard, definitely when we play once a week. This means that after a game a lot of shit posts will come up, especially after a defeat. Heavy moderation should prevent this from happening and let such ideas only be allowed in post-match threads (that's why they exist, to discuss the match).

* Reposts. FB video has been posted three times, Ashley Cole video two times. 

* As proposed, have a monthly/weekly ticket exchange/request thread to avoid seperate request threads. (I'm not really into this idea, because there are plenty of sites/forums that discuss these matters, for example [TalkChelsea](http://forum.talkchelsea.net/).) 

* Big update on sidebar threads and better visibility of the sidebar is necessary.

They don't do it with Doctor because 

1) They tried way back when but lets be fair it's a different time now.

2) The new series has had far more international success. So it's going to be difficult to throw in an American version. It's better to just get a piece of the BBC pie by reairing episodes and taking over productions(like Torchwood).

3) The target audience of who is incompatible with the US market. You simply can't air Who to the same audience in the same timeslot here.

Sebastian Larsson - I always thought he was a talented winger. May be worth looking at for free?

Klose - Though he would be 36 next season he still scores goals. May be a useful veteran backup to have around? Odds are he'll go back to Germany though I believe.

Juan Vargas (Fiorentina) - Though he is 30 now he is a decent left footed winger, I may be wrong but I don't think we have any left footers in midfield and certainly none of his class.

Emmanuelson - Now 27, he could be a useful LB, Wing back or LM to have in the squad. Sound technique and pretty pacy when I've seen him.

I have always been a massive fan and I have followed his progress for a while (mostly because he is Irish). He possesses a perfect mixture of youth, charisma, philosophy, drive, tactical determination, man motivating skills, positivity and enthusiasm that the club so badly needed.
He is in the limelight at the moment after that perfect performance and people keep saying he has no past success to draw on, he's too inexperienced. Rodgers worked wonders at Swansea, with foundations already laid at the club he took them to completely new heights and his influence should not be easily dismissed. 

His work at Liverpool has been superb, easing us into his playing style, adapting his own style to suit the players we had, helping players realise their full potential time and again; Downing, Sterling, Henderson, Coutinho and Sturridge were all struggling to be appreciated, had shown potential but not displayed it regularly. All these players (minus Downing) are part of a team, are individual stars and are considered future world beaters by most. Let's not forget that the widely recognised best form player in the world, the 3rd best in most people's books full stop, Suarez, used to take fifteen clear cuts before he stuck it and used to challenge Ashley Young in diving. Rodgers takes rough diamonds and polishes them, lets them express themselves and builds teams/tactics to allow them to reach their zenith if they can.

His transfers have been questioned, with any successes usually being attributed to the transfer commitee but anyone watching Allen on Sunday would struggle to deem him a failure, Coutinho/Sturridge/Mignolet/Sakho/Toure etc... are here because Rodgers wanted them. The pursuits of Costa and Mkhitaryan show not only ambition but an ability to see world class players that would no doubt flourish in his system.

He is also a great face for the club with a great demeanour, reputation and charisma shown time and again in his media dealings. He also shows great confidence and balls (Suarez staying, Gerrard top, top, top player, Tan is a cunt or something similar).

I think the thing to remember with BROD (especially riding high on spurs waves of self loathing) is that he, like all managers has his faults too. His positivity can wear at times, and there is a reason there is a Rodgers/David Brent quiz. He can be tactically stubborn. His use of substitutes leaves a lot to be desired in terms of timing/use to change matches/rest key players and give young players quality minutes. His desire to control has led to two great youth employees being removed (depending on what you would like to believe) He has made transfers which have yet to show their full value or won't  and he can just fail to make decisions that a load of laptops think he should soooo obviously make :)

But despite his few minor faults I appreciate his presence at the club so much that I am genuinely sure no one else in world football could do it better right now. I will continue to be realistic or pessimistic depending on your views but I believe in everything he is trying to achieve, I love our team/squad and it is a good time to be a red.",0,1387498434,null,0,false,1,ce5xrro,t3_1ta8ai,t1_ce5xrro,t3_1ta8ai,null,1428060327,74,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,74

Obviously this only works when the cardholder is there in person; an online transaction can't be referred.

The problem with phoning the customer is that not only could the person phoning be a fraudster, if they are calling a landline they can hold the line open so if the customer tries to hang up and call the bank directly, the fraudster is still there.

What is needed is a way for both parties to securely identify themselves. The bank has ways (however imperfect and susceptible to fraud) to ID the customer, but the customer has no way to satisfy himself that the person calling is the bank.

Public key encryption is probably the best way to solve this, but using such a system would be beyond the capabilities of the majority of the public given that they can't even get to grips with a simple 2FA technology like card readers.

For AVB, clearly Villa is a good proven striker with lots of experience leading teams and winning trophies. Levy didn't want him simply because he couldn't justify shelling out some 10m on a player who wouldn't have any resale value in a year or two. I do appreciate Levy's wisdom in preferring to buy players who are young enough that they can be resold for a roughly equivalent value at some point down the line, but sometimes I wish he would just dish out some cash (which he did this summer on some very good players).",0,1387500715,null,0,false,0,ce5yq7d,t3_1t941f,t1_ce5yq7d,t1_ce5lk1x,null,1428059881,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Less conspiracy theory version: The payrise comes alongside pretty hefty cuts to their expenses, basically they get most of their compensation as their pay now, rather than getting a chunk of it less visibly through expenses. The reason pols are outraged at this decision isn't because it's a payrise, it's actually a pay freeze or pay cut when you look at the whole package - and they want a real payrise (which will be sold to the public as a cut to salary, and then of course hidden benefits on the side).

Shelvey is a bit of a basket case and can't handle the responsibility of controlling the midfield, Leon's legs can't handle more than about one half of football at a time, Canas has looked great but can't play every game. Loaning out Ki at the same time as we were losing Kemy Agustien was a terrible decision. If there's any way to recall him, we should do it the day the window opens. 

If we'd kept Ki, there's every chance we'd have had the legs to actually keep up with Cardiff for the full 90 minutes and possibly sneak through our Europa league group above Valencia, amongst other points we might have won/held on to. I've been bitching about the Ki loan since before it even happened and I'm not going to stop because it continues to baffle me.

for one, buying hulk for what Zenit wanted would have been the worst the worst deal in our history, and one that could have crippled us. not to mention he is a massively overrated player, who relies on his physique much more then his technical ability. and he would get nowhere near the time or space in the PL to get his shots off as he isn't quick footed enough like Bale. 

Villa, he had a tour with us, we offered him everything he wanted but he took less because he wanted to stay in spain and not uproot his family. yeah that is levy's fault as well is it?

i'm happy that levy didn't take the plunge on hulk because we would have been stuck with an overrated player and have very little chance of ever offloading him due to what he would have cost, fee and wages wise.

if AVB was a bit more realistic with his targets maybe we would ahve been in a better position. if moutinho was proving to be too hard why didn't we have a plan b, someone who has a similar play style, they aren't uncommon. we have needed a player in CM that has the ability to play quick first time balls since Modric left and we still haven't rectified that.",0,1387506290,null,0,false,0,ce60xrt,t3_1t941f,t1_ce60xrt,t1_ce5lk1x,null,1428058849,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,corymiller5,null,null,"The Chelsea roster is simply not suited for a 4-4-2 formation. Our outside backs would surely enjoy the freedom that coincide- such as overlapping and outside midfield aid on defense; however, our midfield would be a catastrophe. Not enough of our players have the mindset to play both ways.  Hazard, Mata, KDB, Oscar, Lampard can't play defense whilst Mikel and Essien don't provide enough attacking penetration.  That leaves us with Ramires and David Luiz.  Together- they actually would work brilliantly. However, Ramires tends to be exposed positionally as others do not cover for him, and David Luiz can't seem to control the tempo of the game well enough on his own (he also is a bit of a risk trying to dribble in the middle of the pitch).  

What I propose: 4-1-3-2.

I believe that an Essien/Mikel player sitting in front of the back 4 with not too much attacking leeway would enable the front 5 to flourish.  The space created on his either side would enable the wingbacks to overlap along the sideline. Also, we haven't yet attempted a dynamic forward pairing.  I believe that Schurlle and Torres could work very well together up there, and if need be, bring on Ba towards the end of games for the poacher's goals.  This would create more triangles for our midfield trequartistas to work with and finally see some more fluid passing build-up play.

OP is about as optimistic as it comes, and he's pretty damn realistic about it.  We *do* have some very talented players with absolutely amazing potential.  Of course it's a huge if when it comes to whether they'll realize it or not, but that isn't the point.

And just because you're optimistic doesn't mean you think the players are perfect.  The very fact that they're what ifs shows that we acknowledge the chance that they don't happen.

And if most of our squad is average, I'd say that's how it should be.  We don't have millions to drop regularly, we shouldn't expect to have a squad that blows others out of the water.  I think we have a bunch of good to great players, and a couple with the potential to be much more than that.

But overall, I just don't understand looking down on the optimists.  At a certain point it may become unrealistic, but not even halfway through the season isn't that point.

And as for not having a manager or system in place, it's been four days.  I'll be the first to say we shouldn't have sacked AVB without at least being very confident we had someone as good or better to step in immediately, but you have to give the club a chance to get the right guy.  I'd rather struggle briefly with an interim manager if it decreases the chances of a panic appointment.

And as for having better, more intelligent players, who?  You're trying to be realistic, but realistically who should we have brought in?  Who should we bring in now?  Looking at our summer signings, I don't see anyone save for Paulinho and/or Soldado who I'd say we should have done better than.

As he explains in The End of Time, during the Time War the Time Lords were becoming too ruthless and too ambitious. A quote from The End of Time:  Lord President: ""We will ascend, to become creatures of consciousness alone. Free of these bodies, free of time, and cause and effect, while creation itself ceases to be."" 
The Doctor: "" You see now? That's what they were planning, in the final days of the war... I had to stop them."" The Time Lords had been poisoned by war and ambition, and the Doctor had to stop them from going too far as he began to do himself in The Waters of Mars and becoming gods themselves, so he destroyed them and ended the Time War.)

If we had lost to West Ham, Man City and Liverpool with somewhat reasonable margins he would still be manager. Hell, if he was still manager and we lost this week against West Ham in the style that we did, he would probably still probably be manager.

The biggest problem is he got burnt using the high line three times in a row. I trust AVB, but I would be lying if those results didn't make me think twice. 

His stats are misleading too. No need to hit the Bale-shaped nail with a hammer again. What would have last season's win ratio look like without him? What would this season's win ratio look without the buffer of beating relegated teams in the Europa? Or barely clinching a third round tie against Hull in penalties (did love the match though). 

What about the seemingly daft substitutions? I was pulling my hair out when he put in Townsend. What type of makeshift midfield plays with three natural wingers considering our ""deep"" squad?

Point is, people bitch and moan about why AVB does this or that. About his lineup. About his style. About his subs. Anything but his haircut. Perhaps we are just using his dismissal as a scapegoat to hide the fact that after the losses we have suffered, and the way we look on the field, that fourth (or playing in Europe at all) is probably unrealistic for this season.

true,SackUSMC27,tardis,TARDIS,"Love the ideas.  But what about:

""The Time War""

Think The Old Republic meets Doctor Who.  Both the Time Lords and the Dalek Empire are at the height of their power, but their centuries-long conflict has engulfed all of space and time.  In a radical attempt to turn the tide of the war, a secret group in the Gallifreyan High Council tired of Rassilon's failed schemes have begun recruiting young Time Lords and sending them out among the stars in their own personal TARDISes to fight against the Daleks and any other villains they encounter.

Let's see what kind of classic MMO mechanics I can tie in to Doctor Who:

- Grouping up with other players would allow you to pilot your TARDIS the way it was meant to be (6 pilots!)--increasing stats, unlocking special abilities, taking on harder challenges, etc.
- Pets would become--what else--your companions.  Recruit them through special side missions.  Each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Increase their loyalty, or they may decide to leave you.
- For crafting, we could have your sonic whatevers be able to detect various timey-wimey things across the maps and then combine them to construct things that go ding when there's stuff.
- Dying during certain pre-set battles/missions/key points forces you to regenerate and completely change your appearance, stats, and abilities.
- You choose a ""real"" Gallifreyan name at the start, but over the course of the game, by completing various long-term tasks/achievements, you can earn titles to replace your name like the most famous Time Lords.
- Special quests can be triggered that can only be completed by bringing in some of your past regenerations (now AI controlled) to help you.
- The main story line can take you all the way up to the final day of the Time War and have you assist the Doctors with sealing Gallifrey away in the pocket universe--at which point all those previous times and locations become time-locked.
- If the show eventually has the Doctor ""rescue"" Gallifrey, that would be the end game, allowing players who have completed the main quests to access all locations at all times without concern for the overarching ""time war"" plot--just like the Doctor.

true,dsruix,tennant,Tennant,"If we look at 10s arc through his seasons, including 9 as well really, we see how he grows in his love for the humans. From Martha telling him he needs someone to Donna helping him see how he has the power to help, even if it's just a little in Pompeii. He does things he doesn't have to and that's the beauty of it. He didn't have to have mercy on the racnoss, he didn't have to save that 1 family in Pompeii, but he did as he learnt from his companions. Then we also see him in midnight where he is alone and the trouble he finds himself in is absolved by the waiting hug from Donna. All of this culminates in perhaps one of the most profound sayings of 10 to Wilf: I think you look like giants. That showed his growth, the softening of the doctor after the hardening war. These moments were not driven by plot, but by character, they needn't have happened, but they did.

On the flipside, we have 11, who has his fair share of grand speeches (akatan, submarine) but they really are plot devices more than they serve his character. 11 doesn't really do anything he doesn't have to do for the plot. There's no resolution to old Amy because there doesn't need to be, there's no real resolution to Rory and Amy's departure and his mourning of them, that we see is plot driving to the next companion. Clara never built herself into the woman who would jump into the doctor's timeline, the plot did. And the doctor didn't build himself into the man who would save her. His acceptance of the war doctor in the 50th is entirely plot driven. He is the man who forgets because it's stated and because he keeps telling it when there's a giant evil that needs schooling. 10 is the man who regrets because he showed that to us, through his battle within himself.

Try to ask yourself what you'e *really* scared / upset about it; try to get to the core of that and then, try to rationalise it away. Speak to your boyfriend and your family about how you feel. Look back on other times in your life when things have been hard, and how you've managed to climb back up into a better place. If you're loved and supported then (the lack of) money in your bank or Christmas presents becomes less of an issues. Remind yourself that it will all be okay, you have a game plan for how to save money once you start getting it (assuming you do!) and that you've just got to get through this difficult bit.

Remember, there are a lot of ways to enjoy yourself without money, also. Go for walks, re-read books, eat modestly but well. Exercise / play sports, that will help you anyway, from the natural endorphins. 

You'll get your time to treat everyone in the near future.

The section that collapsed was to the back right of the domed ornate ceiling, as far as I could tell, there was nothing other than wood or plaster that fell, no chandelier or lighting rigs as I have heard reported. It's hard to remember exactly how big the section that fell was, but I think that it was about 5-6 metres across and slightly longer in the stage-audience axis.

true,ImThe10Doct0r,tennant,Tennant,"WARNING: Long post

Great idea, but I have several suggestions. 

1) should only be for computers. I don't think consoles could handle a game of this magnitude.

2) instead of The Doctor, you can be any random Time Lord that you can create and name yourself. Or could be other Time Lords/Ladies like Romana or The Corsair, or even the Doctor if you really wanted to. And if/when you die, you regenerate. And if it's someone you made, you get to choose if it's a man or a woman, but that's it, everything else is random on how you look. And after a regeneration, you get to choose what clothes the version wears. And you always start with the first version. So if you were The Doctor, you'd be the first Doctor

3) When talking to people, it should be similar to that in mass effect or even like in the Telltale Games. You even talk to your companion(s) this way, but you have more options with them, but you should use gaming headphones so you can actually talk to the other people irl

4) If you make a Time Lord/Lady, you should have the choice to have a weapon as well as a sonic screwdriver. You get to choose what type of gun you have (weapon choices are only pistols or the gallifrean rifle seen in DotD). And you make this choice each time you regenerate.

5) The sonic should do more than open doors. It should've able to hack into computers and scan things and turn things off and on. And each one of those should be different. Like when scanning things, it should show the object or person with a little circular x-rayed area on it signifying your sonic, and you basically have to try and find the thing(s) wrong with it or the person, which while be signified by glowing read areas. Hacking into things should be trying to find the right wavelength. Opening doors should be similar to the lock picking in Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, except instead of lockpicks, there should be a light signifying your sonic. Also, instead of moving things up, you should have to move things down and turn things, and at the end you have to push something back. 

6) companions can be captured, tortured, and even killed. If the companion does die (though if the Time Lord/Lady is good enough, s/he should be able to stop his/her death), the player who is the companion has to create a new one and has to wait for the Time Lord/Lady player to find them. 

7) If you choose to create a character, you also get to choose what you TARDIS will always look like (except for a police box, since that's the Doctor's icon)

8) The game should be a puzzle/mystery/strategy game. You should solve things, look for clues and evidence, and, when necessary, lead troops into battle. 

9) When you get into the TARDIS and go to the console, it should go to a galaxy map similar to the one in mass effect, but when you click on a planet it also shows a time period you can go to, and each planet has differing amounts of time periods you can go to. For example, earth you can go to any century you want, while in Trenzalore you can only go to 2 different time periods. And when you decide where and when you want to go into the sequence you said, but if you messed up a quarter of the time, you go to that planet, but a different time period (unless it only has one, then you still go). And if you mess up half of the time, you go to a different planet in the same solar system. And if you missed 3/4 of the buttons, you're somewhere halfway across the galaxy.

true,0xbdf,null,null,"Game designer here.

Doctor who is tricky, mainly because of the nature of the *conflict* involved. In your description, you reference Elder Scrolls and Open World and Quests and Unlockables and all sorts of fun things that the best games have. The thing is that all of these elements are peripherals on top of the CORE of the game, which is some mechanic &amp; system about *conflict and conflict resolution.* 

Creating a conflict/resolution system for Doctor Who isn't as simple as saying ""swords, bows, and magic... damage and hp... grind for xp and level up."" These things have been done enough that we can fill in the blanks. The doctor is more... subtle than that. He typically resolves conflict with plot devices and ""being clever,"" which is really hard (and I mean ***REALLY HARD***) to make fun for the player, for a number of reasons.

Your game design is missing the most important thing: what you DO. *We can't fill in these blanks*. Walk me through the resolution of an encounter between the doctor and, say, a group of 5 daleks. What actions do I (the player) take in order to defeat these foes?

Then, convince me that EITHER this conflict/resolution system can be used to handle an appropriately diverse set of encounters to support the size of the world you're envisioning, OR describe a sufficiently large set of conflict resolution systems to allow for this much content.

Then, you and I can talk about scope. ;)

My intent here is to engage you in a way so as to create the possibility for this to be a good game, as that is the only way I choose to engage a game idea. I choose to take your idea seriously because I &lt;3 Doctor Who and have thought about this before too.

&gt; Shouldn't we be doing things to fight censorship rather than putting such efforts down?

I notice that you have not refuted the point that I made; that there are ways to circumvent the censorship without having to entrust third party..

Now to address the points that you made;

1. *Refusing to give in to censorship.* This is a method of circumvention, not an effort to stop censorship.

2. *You built this with purely altruistic intentions.* If that were the case surely you would have invested your time in educating people to use the already existing free and secure circumvention techniques which exists, rather than creating a freemium product which is less secure.

3. *You should be immune from criticism because you are fighting censorship.* You are not fighting censorship, you have created a product which reduces peoples security on the web and circumvents censorship. Even if you were fighting censorship there is no enemy, ideal or cause so evil that the methods of anyone opposed to it are beyond criticism.

If I might be blunt you are advertising your own product (which is against this reddits rules isn't it?), which is a security nightmare for anyone who uses it, under the banner of altruism but the motivation seems to be that of personal gain, be that financial or in terms of exposure",0,1387528788,null,0,false,0,ce67zrw,t3_1tb61y,t1_ce67zrw,t1_ce67j51,null,1428055546,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

We have seen this this season in the way he has tried a few formations and has allowed the team to mix up the passing from time to time, rather than naively insisting on short passing 100% of the time.

That says he still has not strayed from his philosophy on the game. I am a big fan.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"I know why and how radicalised Islamists become so. You are right that radicalisation isn't related to the Quran but you are also being somewhat disingenuous as the Quran can and is used to provide justification for Islamists actions once they have become radicalised. 

I also know that it is only possible because Islam hasn't undergone an Enlightenment and cannot undergo an Enlightenment because the doctrine doesn't allow interpretation and has to be taken literally. This contradicts your assertion about the quotes being taken out of context as no contextualisation is permitted. 

I also know that Islam doesn't separate the religious and the political, making it unique amongst the Abrahamic religions and posing unique problems for dealing with radicalised adherents that are not applicable to other extremists like those you mentioned. A political belief can be refuted with evidence. A religious belief is not based on evidence but faith and is much harder to refute. Fortunately within the Quran there are passages that do refute violence against Kuffar. Unfortunately most of these are superseded by later pro-violence passages (which the irony of God getting things wrong in the first place is ignored) which take precedence.

So whilst it is possible to use the Quran to deradicalise Islamists the Quran can and is also used to provide justification for Islamism in the first place.

That's the private sector's choice, not the government's fault.

&gt; Harping on about how London is propping us daft, flat cap bastards up North is pathetic when the elite in London are propping up most of London and yet all you read is ""oh well London puts in more than it takes out""

I never used those words, and the numbers don't lie. As a region, London contributes more than it gets back.

&gt;  ""regional GVA up north is horrific,"" bore off mate.

It is pretty bad compared with down south.

&gt; The beeb ran a show about the London Underground last year, half of money spent on the Underground comes out of the public pocket, Crossrail getting billions, Thameslink getting billions, no fucking wonder there's nowt to shout out about outside London when Leeds can't even get a Tram System built

Yeah, this will be for two reasons:

1 - London (as I've said before, and it is irrefutable fact) contributes more than it gets back, so any money going into London is justified in that respect. 

2 - It is also easier to justify as London is growing and there are 1.2bn tube journeys a year. Putting money into London probably creates upward multipliers more than in any other place in the UK. It's just meeting demand.

I'm not blaming anyone as such, just stating the facts, as London seems to get an unfair rep from people who've never lived or worked there. ",0,1387534739,null,0,false,0,ce68yq4,t3_1t8n2c,t1_ce68yq4,t1_ce5xt2s,null,1428055093,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,nine8nine,cnty-england,England,"I wrote that on my phone so it may come across as a bit harsher than I wanted it to.

Basically I have no problem with immigration at a certain level. I would like to see more young skilled immigrants because this country and especially the South East needs them. They do contribute to the greater economy, on a local level however I find the high street near where I live has been ghettoised - there are black businesses, asian businesses and Polish businesses. The problem is, the scale of immigration has allowed this to happen too quickly for the local economy to react.

As a born and bred local I seem to be the only one who frequents all three nationality's businesses, and I've made some good friends amongst all the communities who've settled nearby. That's how I have come to my conclusions - I'm not some shut-in who reads BNP newsletters and refuses to engage, I just report the problems I see. I'm disturbed to be frequently called a racist here and elsewhere for saying these things.

1. The Poles I've met are hard workers, mostly young with families. They do not invest money in the UK. Most I've met are convinced they are going to go back to Poland some day and build a house, but several have already done that and are still there because a house in Poland, while nice, does not pay the bills. Several have started businesses. They openly admit to finding workers who've just arrived and will take low wages, as they did when they arrived. The ones who work for British businesses are model workers - most of these are sending about 70% of their pay back to Poland to support family, commendable but not exactly good for the economy.

2. The Ghanaians run many of the hairdressers, grocers and jerk chicken shops (despite not being Caribbean). My immediate neighbour, one of the most prominent local businessmen in the community, is being pursued by the council for longstanding non-payment of tax and business rates. Again, the third or fourth largest industry within the community is remittances. Ghanaians in my area shop exclusively in Ghanaian shops, or in Lidl. Several enterprising business owners buy their goods at Lidl, mark them up and sell them to older members of the Ghanaian community who will not shop in non-Ghanaian stores. The Ghanaians have been here the longest and are most integrated, about 75% of the community can speak English well enough to be understood, in my own estimation. I do not know the literacy rates.

3. The Pakistani community in my area seem to have the most internal problems. I cannot begin to fathom what it must be like coming from Pakistan to England for the first time. My other immediate neighbour is a local business community and stalwart of the mosque down the road - in our across the fence conversations he complains to me most about endemic corruption and bribery within the Pakistani community. It was he who first explained to me what the bungalows springing up in the back gardens of several houses I overlook were, as he is related to some of those families. Although some are genuinely provision for large numbers of relatives who may come to visit, in his own words he explained that several wealthier Pakistanis would club together buy houses and pack them full of immigrants who paid to come to the country to work. If one owned a chicken shop an the other a Halal butcher, the workers would be assigned to each to pay off their debt in coming over. Pay is therefore negligible, as are worker's rights. Abuse and quasi-slavery are therefore common, even before you factor in the Byzantine caste system, imported wholesale. The Pakistani community in the UK is riven by political and indeed tribal affiliations of those back home, and thus as a community it is hardest to get a feel of what exactly many are here to accomplish. Some are here to escape Pakistan, some are here to recreate Pakistan. The second group I will admit I do not welcome with open arms.

Sorry for the essay. This is England 2013 I guess. Merry Christmas.

&gt;Although the manufacturing sector's share of both employment and the UK's GDP has steadily fallen since the 1960s, data from the OECD shows that manufacturing output in terms of both production and value has steadily increased since 1945. A 2009 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, citing data from the UK Office for National Statistics, stated that manufacturing output (gross value added at 2007 prices) has increased in 35 of the 50 years between 1958 and 2007, and output in 2007 was at record levels, approximately double that in 1958.


&gt;This is a trend common in many mature Western economies. Heavy industry, employing many thousands of people and producing large volumes of low-value goods (such as steelmaking) has either become highly efficient (producing the same amount of output from fewer manufacturing sites employing fewer people- for example, productivity in the UK's steel industry increased by a factor of 8 between 1978 and 2006) or has been replaced by smaller industrial units producing high-value goods (such as the aerospace and electronics industries).


&gt;However, manufacturing employment fell faster in Britain since 1998. This started with manufacturing productivity flatlining from 1993 to 1997 and a rise in pound sterling. PricewaterhouseCoopers presumed that British manufacturing was less able to adapt to new production immune from Asian competition. Since 1993, Britain also invested less in R&amp;D and adaptation than its OECD competitors.

What the UK has lost out on in manufacturing is the cheap tat that we can produce cheaper in other places and improvements in automation. There is simply no way to re-create that industry and why would we want to it's inefficient?

They're easy to find - on a side road off new street in the city centre. A Too is a seriously lovely, friendly place - they even have a shop dog!

www.atoo.co.uk
www.autographmenswear.co.uk

If you're into Jazz, Soul, Funk and other good live music, check out The   Yardbird Jazz Club. It's about 5 minutes walk from New Street train station. Free live music most nights of the week, and drinks are reasonably priced. It's run by real music lovers, so they make a real effort to get good musicians in.

If you like real ale, try The Wellington. If you like more young 'cool' places, try The Victoria and Brew Dog. For cocktails try Island Bar, or Bodega (South American themed with good food.) All of those places are in the city centre.

I'd also recommend the Ikon modern art gallery. It's in a nice area called Brindley Place. The café serves excellent food, and the gift shop is well stocked with books, mugs, cards, hard to find magazines etc.

http://ikon-gallery.org/

If you like art (and perhaps even if you don't), make sure you check out the city's main gallery just at the end of new street. It's one of the highlights of the city for me. Has a nice secluded café where they don't play any music - great for a bit of peace and quiet.

The new library is definitely worth checking out too - it's the biggest public library in Europe, and was opened in September. You can go up quite high and stand on the 'terrace' and look over the whole city.

There's a museum in the Jewellery Quarter which is quite cool. It contains an old workshop where the workers got up and left in 1981, and nothing has been moved since then. So it's like a kind of time capsule. There are a couple of good pubs in that area too - The Rose Villa Tavern, The Lord Clifdon, and The Church Inn http://www.bmag.org.uk/museum-of-the-jewellery-quarter


The botanical gardens is quite nice, but probably not somewhere you'd spend more than a few hours. There's not a great deal else in the surrounding area.

http://www.birminghambotanicalgardens.org.uk/

Finally, I'd suggest Birmingham Nature Centre. It's next to Canon Hill Park/Midlands Arts Centre, which is worth a quick visit in its own right. It's a pleasingly quiet little mini zoo.

But now ? Im not so sure. We are at times incredibly passive, largely non threatening and quite frankly prone to dull performances. There are however the results. Scraping through game after game and finally getting hammered every now and then isnt really a recipe for entertainment. Even though it might provide the necessary points to stay near the top.

It's mostly a South American player thing though.

&gt; tax free isn't the case in monaco anymore... they just recently got lumped into the sum of the Ligue 1..

This doesn't seem to be the case entirely.

[AS Monaco has been told that they have to move their headquarters to France by June 14'](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/736acd48-da89-11e2-a237-00144feab7de.html#axzz2o0qVZHZg), so while they did get lumped into Ligue 1 by the LFP they're not subject to any French tax laws *yet*.

Another interesting article on this, [here](http://www.sportspromedia.com/guest_blog/as_monacos_taxing_problem/).

Not to go into this too much, but I don't expect UEFA, the FFF, and the LFP to change this. That and similar competitive advantages exist for football clubs that [incorporate in places like the City of London, Belgium, or Ireland](http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/06/tax-havens-delaware-bermuda-markets-singapore-belgium.html).

Worst case scenario, you're right and guys like Carvalho, Abidal, and Falcao have to give up their tax free earnings in the 2014-15 season. If that's the case, they might all leave beforehand.

&gt; people don't realize how much of a sell out the dude really is

This might be just me but I'm sort of hot and cold on the whole 'sellout/greed' thing. 

Henry leaves Arsenal as their top goalscorer for Barcelona in 2007 while getting a wage bump to £4.6 million a year, and he's regarded as a legend, not a sellout.

Beckham to Real Madrid and then the LA Galaxy, people remember him as part of the Class of 92' and again, a club legend. Not only that but a national figure, the guy was voted as one of the top 100 Britons.

We have Eto'o, who left a massively successful Inter Milan for the European pinnacle of football, Dagestan! Why? Because he was getting paid €20 million a year after taxes. 

People are constantly giving Ibrahimovic warranted praise, but he's played the big three clubs in Italy, Barcelona, and PSG (where he's making €14 million per year net) Is he a sellout? Or is he just going places where he feels like he can win more trophies?

Falcao won trophies at Porto, he wont trophies at Atletico, and there's a good chance he'll win something at Monaco. Is Falcao driven by money? Maybe, but the money wouldn't be a factor if he wasn't a great player (which he is). Which is why I don't totally believe he was a sellout. 

Atletico was by no means the top of the pyramid for him, he was bound to move on. At least he moved to a club that has proven pedigree in the French league, and not to Dagestan. Right?

Doesn't think of Real or Galatasary in Champions league. Happy with draw because of Didier returning. Their last two managers were very good.

Won't comment on Cardiff because he isn't involved and so doesn't know the full story. Never happy when a manager is sacked. Owners should trust managers and give them the chance to preform. Every club is different.

Something about Cole and rest.

Azpi isn't injured.

We don't have the player to score week after week to show in numbers the quality of our play.

Being punished when we lose possession. Losing points and matches because we don't kill the game.

We are dominant in matches (according to official stats). Play with a lot of attacking players. Players are responsible when we lose the ball to change their mindset and become defensive.

Ivan plays right back, JT plays centre and Cole isn't playing from beginning. Azpi plays left back.

Excited about Arsenal game, wish it was earlier.

Its his Chelsea that has a good record against Wenger's Arsenal, not him against Arsene.

We are not scoring enough goals.

Stupid question asking if he will play his best team against Arsenal.

No psychological edge, we just play better than Arsenal.

Christmas wish is to win.

Everytime a potential author says something they are trying to expand their audiance in order to help their long term financial interests. When Jeremy Paxman makes comments on the Graham Norton show he is trying to expand their audiance.

* In what ways were those goals not achieved in the interim?

* What were the overriding reasons for the sacking of the manager?

* Did you have a successor lined up? A shortlist? Or was the decision to sack the manager made before any consideration was made to his successor?

* If the latter, why do you think a lack of a manager was preferable to the continuation of AVB in charge?

* Are we closer now that AVB has left to the long-term goals in the first question?

* What would you now consider a successful season this year?

* Where the hell is this new stadium?

* How would you explain the fact that we have been competing for the same objective since Martin Jol was the manager and we still haven't become an established Champions League side? Do you consider this a failure? What responsibility do you think your decisions have in this stagnation?

* Do you think we have replaced Modric, Van der Vaart and Bale? If not, why not?

They might be happy about it. The third party ownership puts it into a bit of a quagmire, and to be honest if it can't be resolved I'm confident in saying that there's a 0% chance he'll move to England. 

In what was possibly /r/soccer 's best thread ever, [nikcub's thread explains Falcao's move to AS Monaco and some of the aspects of third party ownership]. It's worth the read, and not worthy of me trying to haphazardly sum it up in like 100 words.

If there's one big takeaway from it, it sounds like Falcao's moving around has more to do with investors than himself.

I'm not sure what other London cyclists think about this proposal, but I'm really disappointed.

This is not a network, it's just some quiet roads highlighted on the map. Look at the map and try to plan routes you take on a weekly basis or even monthly basis. If you had to use the quiet road networks you'd just have to take a longer trip. While these roads are probably quieter, I imagine TFL will do nothing to transform the streets into bike-friendly streets. Well they'll definitely put up some signs and some paint on the ground, but really, what will that do?

I want to see connected East-West routes and lots of North-South routes. Even if I have to bike a bit out of my way to get to one of these straight-shot routes, I can get on it and enjoy my ride. It's like the Tavistock Place cycle track. I can hop on it and forget about lorries and changing lanes, I can just *enjoy my ride*. [Link for anyone interested.] (http://www.camdencyclists.org.uk/camden/campaigns/ssl-upgrade/)

I want a network, not a highlighted map. TFL wouldn't allow cars to be limited to this proposed network because it would take a lot of time and mental effort (You have to make a lot of turns) to get anywhere. TFL is taking a lot of effort to improve the status for current cyclists with small incremental changes but the changes they are making are never going to create new cyclists. You need a real network that makes someone say ""Oh hey, I live next to this cycle route that takes me straight to work. I'm going to buy a bike and cycle to work.""

I have no idea what you're talking about. The ""land"" was the remnants of the Ottoman Empire that the Allies promised the Arabs but then divvied up between themselves (the French got Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, the British Palestine, Iraq, Iran).

If you're discussing earlier than this then the history of the Islamic lands go alllllllllllll the way back to 600AD or even before then (600 AD - ~1200AD were the glory days, the mongols followed this and brutally sacked Baghdad). If we go even further back to the BCs then these lands were always hotly contested (Canaan or modern day Palestine/Israel was the 'trading wheel' of the ancient world).

It might interest you to know that Islam spread often because of the highly effective administrative skills the Muslims had (at the time). Look up the Mali empire, they adopted Islam as their state religion not because they really believed in it (most of the population remained animist) but because they wanted the administrative side that came with it. The Mongols and Turks also arguably picked it up for similar reasons.

If you want the ""evil empire"" of the middle east then the Turks and the Ottoman Empire is probably as close as you'll get and that empire died at the end of World War 1.

The arab nations in their glory days were known much more for trade than warfare and in the early days of Islam the religion spread in many more ways than just war.

Every religion is intertwined with politics throughout its history. Remember that we, the West still have leaders (in the US and in Europe) that talk in terms of religion (e.g. Tony Blair, George Bush). While we're much more secular these days its worth noting that this is a very recent development.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"&gt; But Christianity does not come with similar political frameworks built into it in the way that Islam does

The Vatican? Remember the Pope was historically a figure of IMMENSE power and constantly interfered with the politics of Europe throughout its history (i.e. he often started massive wars - abroad and in Europe and almost always picked sides in internal European wars). The west have had countless power struggles between the church and the state. It's right now that these dialogues are happening in the Middle East. Read up on the father of Turkey (Ataturk) that's less than 100 years ago, in terms of history that's _very_ recent.

Drawing on a religious book as a historical reference is never going to sway me. If you compare the Middle East of 600AD with the West then they were much more progressive and advanced at the time so I don't really understand your point here.  
While Jesus was a smiling, happy-clappy kinda guy that never prevented the Christian Church from being an _incredibly_ destructive influence (and occasionally constructive) over the course of history and across the globe.

&gt; They are highly unlikely to catch up

I completely disagree with you. Read up on the modern day people of every Islamic country. I know people who live in Pakistan and Iran that are very secular and often struggle with the Islamic system in the same way that Westerners would. A lot of people within these countries who identify themselves Muslim are like this, they're very similar people to us! Arab Spring is just the start, these people need their own representation before they can shun the shackles of religion. When a dictator is in charge religion offers sanctuary because its a legimate opposing power base that a dictator has difficulty controlling. So its not surprising that religion is still strong in these countries.

Once these countries throw off their dictators and gain their own free will they will start to resolve their internal issues. Look at how Egypt rejected the Muslim Brotherhood.

For the record Muslims shouldn't even be fighting the west, they have a massive internal feud (Sunni/Shi'ite) and it just demonstrates how much we've dicked about with the Middle East that extremists consider the west a higher priority target than their opposing form of Islam.",0,1387543540,null,0,1387543951,0,ce6aa5o,t3_1t8rox,t1_ce6aa5o,t1_ce6a5eq,null,1428054478,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Popular mechanics, on 'surface contamination':

&gt;[In the past two years alone, a series of surface spills, including two blowouts at wells operated by Chesapeake Energy and EOG Resources and a spill of 8000 gallons of fracking fluid at a site in Dimock, Pa., have contaminated groundwater in the Marcellus Shale region.](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/coal-oil-gas/top-10-myths-about-natural-gas-drilling-6386593#slide-4)

On contamination of water supply:

&gt;[In May, Pennsylvania officials fined Chesapeake Energy $1 million for contaminating the water supplies of 16 families in Bradford County. Because the company had not properly cemented its boreholes, gas migrated up along the outside of the well, between the rock and steel casing, into aquifers. The problem can be corrected by using stronger cement and processing casings to create a better bond, ensuring an impermeable seal.](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/coal-oil-gas/top-10-myths-about-natural-gas-drilling-6386593#slide-8)

The BBC, on earthquakes: 

&gt;[There are also worries that the fracking process can cause small earth tremors. Two small earthquakes of 1.5 and 2.2 magnitude hit the Blackpool area in 2011 following fracking.

""It's always recognised as a potential hazard of the technique"", says Professor Ernie Rutter from the University of Manchester, ""But they're unlikely to be felt by many people and very unlikely to cause any damage.""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14432401)

To be honest I am sure that fracking could go ahead and for there to be relatively few instances - although the risks are real and could lead to big problems if care is not taken. It also has benefits over coal, which is fucking awful in general.

The point is not to ban all fracking - but to regulate it heavily to ensure there is the least possible risk and have harsh penalties for those who allow accidents to cause environmental damage or cause peoples taps to shoot fire.

Good choice! Game play's a little slow for my liking but still a cracking game. Gutting when you lose a soldier you've had for a while.

&gt;trading screens

You work in The City? There was a post on /r/tipofmytongue the other week about a show where a Dutch guy spunked $1,000,000 of his money on training (I think 8) members of the general public to trade and then letting them loose on the actual stock market with his money. So he set up a hedge-fund out of total novices, basically, funding it all himself and hoping to make some money. It was called Million Dollar Traders, and is uploaded in full on YouTube. The concept is better than the show, but it's still worth a watch I think. Fairly interesting!

Anyway...

I'm really not feeling much joie de vivre today. I had a job application to check over, the position was one which really suited what I want and was actually in my range in terms of qualifications. Which is practically a miracle. It was quite a new vacancy and I got the application form done and dusted but ran out of time to check and send it. So I got to the computer today, ready to check that I'd not made any stupid mistakes and send it off when it comes up that, 2 days after opening, the vacancy's now closed because of the volume of applicants. Bitterly disappointing, but I can at least take solace that even if I had made it, I wouldn't have got the job anyway once they'd read my cv and whatnot. So there was that.

Then I found another, practically perfect job, at Santander which I hastily set on applying for and rewriting my cv for it so I could really sell myself. So I'm happily trundling along, feeling like the king of the world because of the confidence I have in answering all the questions and whatnot. Then halfway through I try progressing to the next page and just kept getting ""Fatal error"" messages so that totally nixed that for the day because I ran out of time again. So, I'm hoping that whatever the fatal error was is rectified by the next time I get access to a useful computer, and that by that time the vacancy hasn't closed. 

It already became just a bit too much for me quite a while ago, but now it's getting even more just a bit too much for me, to be honest.

On the plus side, I'm happy with my new cv. I finally listened to myself instead of others saying ""Your personal statement doesn't really matter, it should only be a line or two long"" . I ignored that because my cv is pathetic, and I think a personal statement should actually show some personality, and make a statement. I need to tart myself up and really sell myself because nothing on that cv other than what I say will be impressive. Been angry with myself for how it is for ages but I've let other voices win out to what I feel is my detriment (heh, story of my life) so yeah, pleased with that.

Fucking hell this is long and dull. Sorry about that, everyone!

true,amongthewolves,lfc99,,"Flanno's been brilliant as a cover for LB. He's been asked to step up and has done it brilliantly. However, the only issue that I have with Flanno is that he isn't as attacking oriented as Enrique. Especially with the way Rodgers wants to employ his fullbacks in his system, Flanno needs to work on that side of his game. Arguably, he seems awkward considering he's being played in the wrong position, but for the circumstances, I'm very proud and excited for him and his future career at LFC.

If we manage to pick up an LB over the January transfer window, I can see Flanno getting sent on loan to get a full season to build up his game. Cissokho might get sent back to Valencia, since he hasn't had a really great time at LFC. Even with the chances that were given to him, he looked one-dimensional and often gave up the ball to the opposition. Enrique might eventually get lowered in the pecking order depending on the quality of the LB we get.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","It's nothing to do with the manufacturer's guarantee, it's the Sale of Goods Act. 

Goods must be fit for the purpose for which they are sold, and last a reasonable length of time.  ""Reasonable"" isn't defined in law - you wouldn't expect the oil filter in your car to last as long as a fridge, for instance - but the maximum is six years.

This is with the retailer, not the manufacturer, so it's them you need to go back to.

Upshot: If you buy a fridge with a 1 year warranty and it packs up after two years, you can demand the retailer repairs it or offers a refund. Doesn't have to be a full refund - if it's been working for some time, a partial refund may be reasonable. 

The difficulty you'll find is that many retailers train their staff - right the way up to store management level - in company policy and they completely ignore what the law says in training. What they are clear on is that company policy is set in stone, and deviation from it is Not Allowed.

Series 1, for instance, refers to the 2005 series, with the Ninth Doctor.

Season 1 refers to the original season in 1963 with the First Doctor.

The classic series is made up of 26 seasons in total, and you can also refer to series 1 as season 27.

This is fantastic news. He could be the best player to have ever played for the club. No doubt there's a new, clear release clause, and no doubt he's on astronomical wages - but the fact is we have maybe the world's best out-and-out striker playing for us, and playing incredibly well. He looks happy for now, and if we can keep up our form, I reckon he could stay past the summer. If not, we'll get a hefty transfer fee. I know it still won't be worth it, but he deserves to be playing at a club that can offer him anything and everything he wants. If he stays I hope we can become that club for him.

With that said, I still no longer think that AVB had the tactical flexibility in his own mind to bring the team to where we all want it to be.  Another article said it perfectly the other day... If something went wrong, instead of changing his tactics to accommodate, he would play a player out of position, which only works in the short run, if it works at all, in order to maintain is standard formation.  Also, his vendetta against some players was down right detrimental to the team and really pisses me off.

When the people, the *demos*, are not the ultimate source of authority, as they are not when they are dismissed from witnessing the actions of government, then they cannot consider themselves to live in a democracy.

One thinks of Niemöller's famous poem;

&gt; First they came for the Jews

&gt; and I did not speak out
&gt; because I was not a trade unionist.
&gt; 
&gt; Then they came for me
&gt; and there was no one left
&gt; to speak out for me.

But the truth is that they will never come for me. Nor will they come for you. It will always be others who they come for and it will always be others, the guilty and innocent alike, who will be vulnerable to be ensnared by this machine that makes no effort to discriminate between guilt and innocence because these are only standards of value in civil society.

* The possibility of a weekly picture thread, or even ""Show Us Your Jersey"" thread is in discussion.
* We want to actively promote friendly, constructive discussion and discourage personal attacks. We feel discussion surrounding Jose Mourinho, Juan Mata and Frank Lampard are turning particularly nasty.

* Slightly stronger moderation. Removing posts like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1s17x6/david_luiz_leaving_in_january_window_falcao_in/) for example.
* ~~Hoping to entice /u/cech_mate to resume his match thread duties by returning the match thread icons to our CSS.~~
* ~~Open threads for discussing the other games occurring during the week, care of /u/1rudiecantfail~~
* Polishing up the rest of our design. You may have noticed the Europa League trophy being replaced by the Chelsea lion in our header logo. We'd like to add a few tweaks/fixes over the next week or two, time permitting.

All you need to do is use pressure (Quite a lot of it) to propagate cracks througout the reservoir rock to allow recovery of the gas. If you could keep pumping water down the borehole, it would mean that something is leaking. This doesn't happen in practice. The vertical borehole is steel lined down to a depth of a kilometer or more, the horizontal directionally drilled recovery ""channels"" are jacketed, and small seqential explosions puncture the lining and start the cracks. The high pressure water then extends these cracks through the source rock so that the trapped gas (or oil) can flow out.

All of this happens WELL below any aquifers from where we obtain drinking water.

For buying bitcoins, I've used Bittylicious, IBWT, and localbitcoins successfully.  

For localbitcoins, although the sidebar says it's for face-to-face transactions, a lot of UK traders there just use bank transfers - so it's just a case of picking one with a good reputation, who lets the site keep their BTC in escrow.

For those of us in the UK, I think short-term investing is currently difficult to do profitably.  I'm buying long-term, with the view that if the value increases more than the crappy 1.6% p.a my savings account gets me, it will have been worthwhile.  

Short-term investing is difficult for us because it's tricky to buy at a low enough price.  Compared to the exchanges, Bittylicious sells at something like 20% premium, and even localbitcoins is at least 5% over.  UK exchanges may, in future, offer prices that are comparable to those overseas, but there's still added costs: IBWT will cost postage to send money, and bit121 charges £10 per deposit or withdrawal.  For the foreign exchanges, you've got the costs of converting GBP to USD or EUR, and the cost of a international bank transfer.

As for whether it's a good investment, I don't know.  It's impossible to predict.  I don't personally think it'll ever tank to zero.  The one thing that everyone knows about bitcoin is that the price can go up massively, so there'll always be points which trigger buy-ins.  I know that if it crashed to £1 a BTC tomorrow, I - like everyone else on the planet would buy thousands - and up it go again.

As I said, these countries have to deal with issues themselves much like the west have in the past. Instead of focusing on the vote for the Brotherhood please pay attention to fact that enough the Egyptian people rejected it vehemently to depose Morsi. Enough people in Egypt don't want Sharia law and want secular representation.  
Democracy is a still a bit of an odd concept to people who have been oppressed under a dictatorship, many Iraqis when interviewed stated that they would vote for their religious leader or whoever they recommended. They're not used to the ""freedom"" nor do they have enough decent candidates because former dictatorships exiled them/killed them. It will take those people time to realise that their religious leaders are not that good to have in charge either, much like a lot of people in Iran have been realising over the past 50 years.

&gt; Look at how many Muslim majority countries are going backwards. 

In my eyes all of the stable ones are moving forwards. Which are you referencing?

&gt; How do you think Syria is going to end up if the Allawites don't win?

Syria has always been a bit weird. It is a ""proxy-war"" playground either participating (Lebanon/Israel war) or being a victim (today). Remember its a key Russian ally which explains a lot about that country.  
Remember as well that this war is a Shi'ite/Sunni one, read up on that history, understand why the Shi'ites are often pissed at historical Sunni rulers. Not too dissimilar to Northern Ireland and the Catholic/Protestant troubles if you're looking for a Christian comparison.

&gt; The areas controlled by Muslims are seeing beheadings and ethnic cleansing, just like everywhere Muslims have dominated in the last century.

That's a very unfair comparison. North Korea, Nazi Germany, the USSR, Mao, Paul Pot. You don't need religion to ethnic cleanse. You're cherry picking. If we go back over the past century there are tons of war crimes by tons of different religions or non-religions.

&gt; My point is that Christians can resolve their issues and move forward, the bible allows that. The Quran does not. They are not equal books

What makes you think that what is written in the holy book has any relevance? Read up on Jesus and then look at the former Catholic Church, those things do _not_ match (new pope is way better though, makes me think he's actually read his book). What is written in the book isn't actually _that_ important, whats important is the interpretation and the parts the church decides to focus on. This changes all the time.

Remember that the Bible and Jesus's teachings are part of the Muslim religion. These are all Abrahamic religions. To say that one is fine and another isn't is silly. They have the same books, they contain mostly the same message and religious leaders of these religions all have their own interpretations that they use for war or for peace.

-----------

What is more unique about the Muslim population is that they mostly live in areas of the globe that have experienced a lot of very recent and sometimes brutal political upheaval. When people are looking for reasons why extremists exist then _that_ is a much more compelling reason than the religion of choice.  
The problem is though is that not many westerners really know Middle-Eastern history that well which is why people tend to blame the religion instead.

Clubs and players will often have informal verbal agreements (these are more common) - see Bale and Modric at Spurs.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Keep in mind that the reported offer for Suarez from Arsenal was £40,000,001 which didn't meet Liverpool's valuation (actually sounded like it was about £15m short of what they wanted).  Real never came in with an offer, nor Bayern, Monaco or Barca.  So Liverpool had a single offer for Suarez, it didn't meet the valuation and was to a league rival.  That is pretty simple to turn down.

On the other hand we had a world record offer for Bale which met our valuation and put him outside the league.  That is a pretty hard offer to turn down.

I think the bigger difference between Liverpool and Spurs has been that Rodgers has shown he is willing to change tactics and systems as need be.  Add into the fact that they made some fairly astute transfers (and got a bit lucky for Sturridge and Couthinho to pan out as well as they did) and the combination seems to work.

Its easy to say things would be different if we kept Bale, but we have no idea if that is the case (we probably would still have been reliant on Bale pulling a moment of brilliance out and struggling to score otherwise for example).

true,nycsurfer,num22,,"I looked through r/soccer and r/coys and couldn't find it with the sheer number of articles posted this week.  It might have even been an insightful comment on reddit, not sure.  

The point of it was that last year (and a lot of this has already been said over and over), the team and AVB were 'Baled' out.  AVB's brilliant tactic was to release Bale and let him roam about and do what he wants.  When a player like Bale is allowed to do that, magic happens.  So no one cared or, as they said, realized, that there was a major issue.  In fact, even in matches when Bale was shut down by the opponent's defense, we played well/scored because Bale was triple marked and their defense opened up.

This year, we lost Bale.  AVB was forced to 'change' tactics but he continued to enforce his 4-3-3/4-2-3-1.  At the beginning of the season, it seemed cool.  We won matches, but not by goals from open play.  It was chalked up to new players.  Then it started to become evident that there was a problem.  If you watch Lamela, he'd run down the right and just as we looked like we were about to threaten, he'd pass back to a defender.  Safety and possession trumped threats.  This would go on the entire match until the last ten minutes and then all the players would start to take solo, long range shots out of desperation.  Sometimes a wonder goal was struck, we'd celebrate, praise the team and AVB, and maybe even win the match.  This was the role of Bale's 89th minute wonder goals last year.  Nothing really changed and a huge problem has been masked for a season and a half now.  

As injuries began to plague the team, instead of changing things up, he'd insist on playing Siggy on the left, he'd play Dembele up front in midfield, he'd have a dreaded Paulinho/Dembele combo.  He'd play Naughton at left back or Vert at left back (a position everyone knows he doesn't want to play).  Freyer's wouldn't get looked at for non-EL matches.  Having finishing/link up problems?  He refused to use Adebayor due to a personal disagreement.  He loves the high back line, which, to be fair, has worked in the past a couple of times.  But not when you are starting Dawson (slow) and Capoue (CDM, not CB) against Suarez (the best striker in the league).  That has shit show written all over it.  Whats worse is that everyone else seemed to know that but him.

He has had some good impacts on the team.  Focusing on the last ten minutes to prevent giving up late goals has saved our asses tons of times.  Working with players individually, watching videos, etc is awesome and I really hope we don't start conceding late again now that someone else is in.

Ultimately, he was exposed.  It sucks that it happened now, mid season, but I'm beginning to think it had to happen.  FWIW, I was pro-AVB on sunday afternoon and did not think he should be fired until I sat down and thought about a lot of the points that the pundits and other commenters had to say.

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"Okay. So you are claiming as a universal fact that all types of organisation such as the ones you've just mentioned are incapable of efficacious and objective research, regardless of where they get their funding.

Can I just tell you how utterly fucking preposterous and imbecilic that comment is? It is also a perfect example of your own heavy political bias.

Also, the mentality you have just demonstrated is an extremely good counter-argument of  the petition's proposition. What follows next is a fact: Knowing who funds research does not inform you of the quality or objectivity of that research.

There are many times businesses, politicians and NGOs want objective and efficacious research. It may come as a shock to you, but there it is.

Another interesting aspect of this argument is that most people in this discussion have a very singular and biased view as to the nature of the 'perpetrators' of this hideous propaganda. ie: evil Global Corporations or rich right-wingers.

However, here's a hypothetical but not far-fetched scene on the BBC News. A gentleman is being interviewed, and he is insisting that due to global warming, the Government needs to invest billions more in renewable energy sources.

Thanks to this petition, the BBC is now committed to informing the viewer of any political or financial interests he may have. So it is revealed that he is heavily invested in a company that manufactures wind turbines. And also that he is a significant landowner who has applied for planning permission to build a large wind-farm on his property.

Now what do you learn from this information?

a: Does one assume that he's lying about global warming in order to make a profit?

b: Does one assume that he is so committed to his principles that he has invested his own hard cash, and that the investment is driven less by profit and more by his ethical beliefs?

The truth is, you don't know. All that has been revealed is that there is a *potential* conflict of interests.

In reality, people will believe what they prefer to believe. So much of Reddit will assume that the hypothetical wind-farmer I used earlier is altruistic (option 'b'). But most Tea Party supporters will gravitate to option a.

&gt; It's depressing that people are still paying the TV license for this shit.

It's not coming out of your wallet. And, if it is, you can always opt out. So what's your point?

&gt; It's depressing that so many lives are regimented by TV cloned in mass rituals of vacuousness.

No one's life is regimented by prime time TV. They turn it on and then turn it off when it is finished. It's just a meaningless TV show to enjoy on a Saturday night (or whenever it airs) with the family or the cat. It doesn't mean anything about anyone. Intellectual, insightful people can enjoy mind fluff just as anyone else can. 

Or do you think intellectual people come back from their super important jobs at  NASA and ponder the meaning of life until dawn like all the other pretentious fucks on OKCupid? 

&gt; It's depressing that people give the BBC such high regard when it's the worst broadcaster in the UK; propaganda, in house pedophilia—it's essentially the GCHQs playground/wetdream.


This doesn't make sense. And, even if it did, I have no doubt that you would say the same thing about any other broadcaster that isn't Dave. 


&gt; It's depressing that so many are wrapped in a meaningless political process when there are far more important things to be active in, even passively engaged.


Like crusading against a dance show on Reddit. 


&gt; It's depressing that there's actually about 15% of the show that's dancing and the rest is bullshit opinionating and arse licking, fluffing something of no importance into great.

This is exactly how I feel about your comment.

I would imagine a 5 Dalek encounter as being on of the special *rare* encounters, which I envision would be more along the lines of a Star Wars- Knights of the Old Republic style multiple choice approach)

The Doctor versus 5 Daleks? Hmmm....

In my mind I envision a series of responses, each with their own unique reactions to the gameplay. Vague, I know. But I'll try an example.

 *Doctor Who-11th- is running down a long corridor attempting to reach a goal set off in the distant area of the city. He continues to check the signal via the sonic screwdriver, as Amy and Rory are in tow. You burst through the doorway at the end of the hall, and it enters into a small cinematic as the Doctor scans the room and Rory and Amy are looking around. Rory goes off and begins to inspect a painting, casually saying ""This looks like you..."" as the Doctor begins to break into a bit of a vague explanation he stops. ""Something is strange...""

*Daleks come into the room from the other doors* 
 ""EXTERMINATE. EXTERMINATE THE DOCTORRRRRRRRR""  

-Encounter begins-

 (Of course, I've suggested it being a two player optionable game so if it were the case the second player would be controlled. In a single player encounter then the companion would have just like an auto-pilot response. Duck and cover, react with whatever they had with them. Gun, pot/pan, silverware, whatever.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 (**Brawn**) The Doctor and his companions attempt a direct approach to escaping or confronting the Daleks. Upon selecting, 3 options appear. 
 1) Attack the Daleks
 2) Use inventory
 3) Panic

 -Attack the Daleks would open regular fight and, well. Quite honestly, pretty stupid to do considering 5 Daleks, but you never know. Good luck. *salute*

 - Use inventory would open your bags and allow you to select something you've picked up during your travels. Maybe you got a smoke bomb, or some fancy object you picked up on some far planet that you don't have a clue what it does but it blinks so let's try...

 - Panic. It doesn't do much of anything except for make the Doctor do a bit of a worried face and Rory hyperventilates. Gameplay then goes straight into the survey option.
-------------------------------------------------------

 (**Survey**) You inspect the room which yields potential items of use during the encounter, selecting them would have a response in the game. -example, Selecting Survey reveals 3 items: A secret door behind a dresser. A length of rope that goes up to a chandelier over the Daleks, and a silver platter on the floor.

 - The secret door when selected would have the doctor go over and begin using his sonic screwdriver to open the door. (on single player, the other 2 companions would take over the interaction with the enemy. On 2 player, it would then become directly the responsibility of the second player to keep the Daleks back from The Doctor to ensure his ability to complete the door opening) Once completed they are able to escape through it.

 - The length of Rope when selected would have The Doctor motion to Amy for her to release it. It drops down onto the Daleks allowing the 3 of them to escape past them in the confusion. Amy and Rory shove one over to get past and run after the doctor.

 - The silver platter, The Doctor does something seemingly random to the platter, waves his sonic screwdriver over it then throws it towards the Daleks. The Daleks shoot at it which effectively blows a nice little hole in the wall which allows them to escape.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 (**Clever**) try a good old fashioned Doctor approach and spit out a quick, ""We give up. We are yours to take.."" That would be the Queue for Amy and Rory to use a quick solve ability. -on cooldown and not a guaranteed solve?-

Again, I don't even have an idea of what I'm doing. I don't even know if this is what you were looking for. So I apologize if it's completely opposite of what you were looking for.

 I imagine the majority of encounters to be mostly a duck+cover, fighting encounters without the specialty encounter interactions(as above) could utilize a fallout style highlight to reveal items of use. Say there's a group of cybermen and as you come down the road a electrical panel lights up and the doctor can use the sonic screwdriver on it to overload them. Generally it would be you going and solving puzzles and other such things to advance through the zones/maps. Directing companions to stand in stuff to open doors, etc. Second players can do the same except for they can take a more direct hand in exploring the landscapes. I don't know really what more to put. I was actually apprehensive about this and was just going to inbox you. But this works as best I suppose.

 I hope that was kind of a bit of what you wanted? Maybe? also. I have no idea why some sentences are blue in this. I apologize. O-o",0,1387554493,null,0,1387557375,0,ce6da4i,t3_1ta1nm,t1_ce6da4i,t1_ce67vn6,null,1428053068,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,Stadred,tennant,Tennant,"Thanks for this. You said it better than I could have. I would love a Doctor Who game as much as OP, but to try to encapsulate the character of the doctor- A centuries old alien with an incredible wealth of information to draw on, in a manner that can be presentable and understandable by a player- As my programming professor would said, ""It's a non-trivial problem.""  
The only parallel I could think of would apply to dialogue options. In the Fallout series, having a high score in int, perception or the like gives you access to options that you as a player may not realize, but the character knows. But that wouldn't work for battles.  
Now that I'm thinking, something actually occured to me. In ""The Eleventh Hour,"" the Doctor saw Rory taking a picture of the prisoner when everyone else is looking at the sky. In that moment, the Doctor had a plan, or at least the kernel of a plan, for how to save everyone. And he built on the plan bit by bit, but the majority of it came through in that moment of realizing what it meant for Rory to be looking at the Prisoner.  
So, to take your dalek example, perhaps there could be some sort of highlight system where world objects appear in different colors (Or say complicated galleferian symbols for problems that are meant to be difficult for a player to utilize). These highlighted objects would represent possible solutions that the Doctor recognizes. The player would interact with them. At a glance, I worry that it would force the game to be on rails, but Deus Ex: Human Revolution had a system that's close.  
So, these daleks confront the Doctor. Let's put them in some industrial area so we have places to run. We'll have the daleks themselves highlighted with a very complicated (To the human player) symbol representing a direct attack. Somehow interacting with the daleks directly would start a direct attack path that would pop up lots of other symbols on the daleks that are close to the first symbol, but with only one that matches. You'd have to hit the daleks in very specific points in order to directly damage them, and hitting the wrong points either cancels the direct action, or harms you, or ""buffs"" the daleks.  
I'm going to assume that we want to encourage different play-styles, so let's further assume that the level of difficulty (Complexity of the symbols highlighting different world areas) depends on your skills in certain areas. For this example, we're assuming the more traditional doctor who thinks through everything rather than directly shooting it. So maybe instead of the complicated symbol that's highlighting the daleks, signifying a direct action in which your character isn't as skilled, we'll have simpler color highlights over other world elements. You're the doctor, so it'll involve running. Somehow interacting with a world element will start things for that color's path. We'd have to have some unifying theme for the player. One color would indicate an area into-which the enemies can be lured, and attacked by a corresponding element that we won't light up until enemies are in the area. Maybe lure the daleks under a foundry bell full of molten metal, and when they're in place, a control panel lights up. We'll have that panel be a dim version of the lure area's color, so that the player knows it *will* be active, just not until there are enemies in the area.  
Another color can indicate a hack-able object that may, say, spawn allies that will fight for you, or pop-up turrets to shoot the daleks.  
The only thing is, I can't see how this could avoid being a game on rails. I don't think you could have an encounter akin to ""The Eleventh Hour"" (See Rory, get the phone, find a laptop, hack the meeting, write a virus, steal a firetruck, get to the hospital, make Amy dream of the Prisoner) while having other paths just as complicated (Including VA) *without* having the game on rails.  
I just realized I spent way too much time writing that, and re-reading it makes my idea seem silly. But I did spend that time, so I might as well post it for all to see and mock publicly.

The government did basically threaten that unless they agreed to this, then there would be a law making them do it.

So the ISPs have probably gone along with it to avoid this legislation, which would be much worse for them because they would be liable for failing to implement the filter properly.

With a voluntary agreement it doesn't matter to them if /r/gonewild isn't filtered, or if a bunch of customers incorrectly have the filters deactivated.

It's also not actually a big deal for them or their customers (the people who pay the bill) because they can easily opt-out if they want to.

A fracture may travel a few tens of metres to a few hundred meters - but it will be directionally controlled not only by the lead in of directional blasting (I.e. the initial fracturing blast will create fissures in a horizontal plane that the water will then exploit and widen) but by the structure of the rock itself - most oil bearing rocks have strong horizontal ""bedding"" which is what the frac'ing process will exploit.

Above the hydrocarbon reservoir rock, you'll have strata of all kinds of things - mudstones, clays, sandstone - whatever, all before you get to either aquifer or surface. These act to constrain the hydrocarbons (if they weren't there than the reservoir would be empty anyway). Clay is a particularly good impermeable barrier - it's very fine particles make it air and water tight. It has the advantage of being plastic and flexible too. It's those kinds of layers that will act to contain the fracturing, hold the hydrocarbons in place, and keep everything happening below that layer separate from everything happening above.


**analogy follows**

Imagine we build a stack of rock. I will use common material with analogous properties.

The gas is trapped in a layer of 9 ply plywood (shale). On top of that is a layer of neoprene (clay) which acts to hold the gas in the ply wood. On top of the neoprene is a layer of cardboard(sandstone), then another layer of neoprene, then a layer of plywood which holds nice clean drinking water. On top of that is a layer of feta cheese.

We want the gas from the bottom layer, we DON'T want to ruin our nice clean drinking water. We drill a hole through all those layers down to the gas, and line the hole with a drinking straw. A little bit of gas escapes (And would be captured) but because the holes in the plywood are not linked up, we cannot recover most of the gas even though the plywood is saturated with it. We use a high pressure water pump to force water laced with sand into the plywood, bursting those thin layers of wood apart minutely. The sand holds the layers slightly apart, allowing gas to flow. We then extract the gas from the plywood, but because we have our drinking straw ""well liner"" and the neoprene rubber layers form a nice tight seal around it, we do not contaminate our clean water, and we don't lose any gas to the environment.

There, we've frac'd a stack of building materials.",0,1387555159,null,0,false,0,ce6dj5f,t3_1tbdyo,t1_ce6dj5f,t1_ce6cow4,null,1428052950,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Crap. My old MacBook started failing (turning itself off) a few weeks before the year warranty gave out. I brought it in to be examined. 'No problems'.

Same again, after the warranty had expired. 'No problems'.

I also got an iPod cable replaced because the ends frayed. The ends of the replacement frayed within a week (probably because I used it plugged in, so it was under some stress - but no more than to be expected).

They can sit one guy in the center of the diamond and if that player is any good he will pick the team apart. The way to stop that from happening is to have one of the wingers track inside to cover the extra man but thats not exactly ideal. Having played on the wing for most of my life I have often experienced this strategic conundrum. You want to help your fullback with the opposition winger and opposition fullback but you also have to help out inside.

&gt;Greenhouse gas emissions of nuclear power plants are among the lowest of any electricity generation method and on a lifecycle basis are comparable to wind, hydroelectric and biomass.

&gt;Lifecycle emissions of natural gas are 15 times greater than nuclear.

&gt;Lifecycle emissions of coal generation are 30 times greater than nuclear.

&gt;In May 2005, British Energy completed a study into the life-cycle impacts of generation from its Torness nuclear power station. The assessment covered the entire fuel cycle and included nuclear waste, spent fuel, CO2, SO2 and NOx emissions. The total emissions of CO2 from electricity generated at the Torness power station, calculated on a life-cycle basis, are estimated to be just over 5 grams/kWh. This compares to emissions of CO2 from a typical UK coal plant of around 900 grams/kWh, based on the operational stage alone. Typical gas power station CO2 emissions are around 400 grams/kWh.

Yes nuclear and wind power take carbon to build, but they use a lot less over their full lifecycle.

If you had read even the title you would know the answer to that so I guess that's a reading comprehension and thinking fail on your part. The TV is literally regimenting the precise time people are putting kettles on and I know because the national grid have just released the data.

&gt; Stop liking what I don't like. 

I gave objective reasons, dumb my argument down all you like if that makes things easy for you. It's immoral to pay the TV license if you are anti-war and pro-truth.

&gt; It's not coming out of your wallet. And, if it is, you can always opt out. So what's your point?

I do opt out. However, it's a bit like refusing to be immunised against childhood diseases*. Enough people watch the BBC and pay for the shit—that makes it easier for fascist regimes to invade countries, torture muslims, privatise the NHS, induce sycophancy in the monarchy, etc. All those harm me and being surrounded by unthinking morons makes life a malady and TV is one of the main causes.

&gt; No one's life is regimented by prime time TV.

You are repeating yourself now, I guess that's an example of the lack of attention span I mentioned. Millions are regimented by TV to the point they put kettles on at the same time. How are you not getting this? Perhaps you watch too much TV.

&gt; Intellectual, insightful people can enjoy mind fluff just as anyone else can. 

This is a fallacious argument. I'm not talking about ""mind fluff"", I'm talking about the TV so I can ignore this.

&gt; This doesn't make sense. And, even if it did, I have no doubt that you would say the same thing about any other broadcaster that isn't Dave. 

It does make sense. The BBC harboured several pedophiles for years, and they put out GCHQ propaganda all the time. MI5 decides who gets to work there. What doesn't make sense is pulling my love of ""Dave"" out of your ignorant fallacious arse.

Just look at the overwhelming scorn and controversy that RM created by putting up 86m for a player that has won nothing of note. Madrid effectively sent the ""major player"" transfer market into orbit by throwing that money Spurs' way. Can you imagine what Suarez's agent is going to be asking for once he *eventually* exits Liverpool for one of the massive European clubs? The money we got for Bale, a player who even by your own admission had one foot out the door, was a gamechanger, and has allowed us to prepare for our future instead of being consistently one step behind. By that I mean, when Berbatov and Modric (and even VDV, IMO) exploded onto the scene, we held on for too long hoping to maximize their value, and instead, put us in a bind to find their replacements -- we still haven't seemed to find our striker, and we still have yet to find that creative spark in the midfield (jury is still out on Eriksen and Holtby).

As to your last statement, that losing our world-class player cost the manager his job leaving the team looking ordinary -- well, yes, losing a club's world-class player (a player that is impossible to replace) will certainly hurt, but it's up to the manager to ensure that the fallout will be a smooth transition.

London had these in spades, of course, but Cardiff is my main point of comparison as that is my nearest city growing up and where we moved here from. We saw Sleeping Beauty in the Theatre Royal recently and it just didn't compare at all. The stage is too small, they had to cut several dances from the prologue. The Dome isn't a huge deal better either.

It can be argued that the city just doesn't have the demographics for my tastes and I won't argue against that, but it still leaves me at odds with the culture of the city and London is nearby anyway.

I think the increase in wages now helps Luis Suarez and his agent have a higher starting point if they were to negotiate wages with another club.

But at the same time the increase in wages does continue to help LFC make Luis Suarez less attainable.

So, this new contract is good for both sides.

Though, ultimately, I don't think the new contract really sheds too much light on whether Luis Suarez stays or goes. There are only a few clubs able to afford to pay the transfer fee and the wages and that hasn't changed.

With Man Utd, Man City and Chelsea in transition this was our one big chance to establish ourselves in the top four, possibly even go for the title. Instead we've blown it. This season looks like a write-off. We're trying to bed in too many new players at the same time. These new players would probably be enjoying life at Spurs if they weren't being expected to replace a prolific Bale. Instead we have the likes of Soldado and Lamela suffering confidence crises.

AVB isn't blameless but I recall something Harry said. ""Tactics are overrated. Good players win football matches"". You look at Di Matteo. Sacked at West Brom and then wins the CL with Chelsea.

What you seen to know.nothing about or completely have forgotten, is that this within the context of consumer law.

You think you need an engineer investigation detailing each component and the expected product life cycle  is expected to get a refund over a claim of a television.

Are you an idiot? 

The cost of a detailed fault report specifically isolating a manufacturing defect vastly exceeds the retail value.

The magistrate rightly will look at the case, deem what is most probable and award based on that.

Owning a tv that is sold and designed to run on uk power, being plugged and used as a tv should suddenly stopped working , with no obvious signs of misuse or water spill etc, will easily highlight poor durability of the product. And you will get a refund.

I think you grossly misunderstand how policy and practice is used in the real world.

If we were discussing a rolls royce jet engine, it wouldn't be going though the small claims court and certainly would be based on engineering forensics.

But consumer law for white goods? Just what planet do you live on?

The UK shale gas reserves at current energy usage will last us about 40 years. Now that means we have about 2x as much as we need if there is a linear decrease in gas usage from now till then (which is quite optimistic).

Now tell me. Is it feasible to replace these gas boilers significantly faster? Your own reference doesn't seem to think so. Now you tell me how it will significantly improve the our gas emissions between now and then to continue to import gas rather than exploiting our own reserves (all things being equal, it's already better as we won't be using energy to ship it in)?

I agree with you that an eventual replacement of these systems is the best approach but it won't happen overnight and will produce significant amounts of carbon if we attempt to do so.


&gt;Are you seriously suggesting that the carbon required to replace a gas boiler comes anywhere close to the carbon emitted by burning gas for the lifetime of that boiler? And if so, please show me how you reached that conclusion, and perhaps you could also share your findings with the national grid.

Like I say, none of this happens overnight. Burning gas in my home boiler to generate heat is quite efficient with modern boilers. Now compare this with NOT JUST scrapping the boiler but the fact that if I, for example, install a heat pump the electricity is being generated elsewhere by burning fossil fuels (about 75% of power stations in this country are fossil fuel) are you suggesting that we can also replace these over night and that that won't also generate a lot of carbon emissions?

TLDR: It's a good reference and I agree with what it says. I also agree with you that we need to replace fossil fuels with better alternatives. What you seemed to miss is that it's recommendations will take almost 40 years to roll out.

If we were serious about doing fracking right, there'd be a nationalised, small-scale fracking corporation (similar in management structure to Network Rail, where the main contractor is a wholly owned subsidiary of a state-run holding company with board-level control) run like a private entity, but with the proviso that it can be stopped immediately and continuously audited by the science establishment, without the possibility of legal challenges from shareholders. Once the kinks are worked out, scale up and tender private contracts using the experience gained to impose restrictions based on experience rather than the best intentions of civil servants.

Fulham remain in 19th at the minute and this is a very winnable game for us whilst Arsenal have Chelsea on Monday at the Emirates and United play one of their bogey teams in West Ham (albeit at Old Trafford).  Liverpool have the early Saturday kick off against Cardiff.  This is a chance to score some very crucial points and start pulling up a few more trees in the title challenge.

With Aguero and Jovetic injured, this is another chance for Guidetti or Lopes to get themselves on the bench with the expected starters of Dzeko/Negredo up front.  EDS play on Sunday in their version of the League Cup but they can do without one of them (presumingly Guidetti)

The Hart/Pantilimon question still remains and with Liverpool at home coming before Palace away, he could go Panti/Hart/Panti over the next three games.
