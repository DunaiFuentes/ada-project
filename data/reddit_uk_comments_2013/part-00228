true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; but why should a person be punished less for causing the brutal crime on account of it not happening often?

agreed here, a crime being infrequent does not mean that it should be punished less

&gt; As it stands today a victim of rape has all the resources society can muster thrown at them to help heal and rebuild their lives, their identity is protected, all of this is as it should be.

Ideally yes, but in practice no. As you said later on it it is still difficult to prove and convict rape, and despite the best efforts of certain groups, there's still a lot of victim blaming that goes on in cases of rape. People still get told they shouldn't have got drunk/ shouldn't have dressed a certain way/ shouldn't have ""led them on"" or any of that bullshit. 

&gt; The victim of a false accusation on the other hand will have that accusation pop up as the first hits on a Google search for their name forever, worse, there will be as many if not more people questioning whether or not it happened (no smoke without fire etc). Sure, this is an extreme case by any measure but an accusation this severe will forever bar you from many professions - not a conviction, just the accusation.

Yeah their identity should not be publicized when it's still just an accusation, to prevent what you have discussed as happening. 

&gt; We have a situation now where there is no effective consequence for making such an accusation, whereas in the past arrests for wasting police time and perjury might have offered some means of redress, they have all but fallen by the wayside.

A false accusation is still a crime and people have been convicted and sent to jail for it. Although yes, as you mention earlier, it is hard to prove that someone intentionally made a false allegation; such allegations can be accidental. 

&gt; but where the evidence is clear, given the lifelong stain and consequence of an allegation like this in today's society, sending them down for a period similar to someone convicted of the allegation doesn't sound unreasonable.

They should certainly be punished, but not to the same degree. An intentional false allegation is not really on the same level of seriousness as someone forcing themselves sexually on to someone else. The crime of rape directly infringes on someone's bodily autonomy and is a traumatic event in itself. Assault incurring bodily harm, indecent assault, neglect, solicitation, encouraging prostitution of minors etc. can all lead to horrendous events afterwards, but people committing those crimes are not given the same sentence as rape, as the act itself is not seen as severe. Someone directly forcing themselves upon someone sexually has caused the trauma, there and then.  

If the person who made the false allegation in this horrific incident in Bristol could be identified and shown to have made an intentional false allegation, who would they been given the same sentence as? If the basis of the punishment being so extreme for the false accusation is because it lead to someone being murdered; do they get charged as if they had actually murdered, or as if they had actually molested a child? The maximum sentence for both those things is life; should the person who made an intentionally false allegation be charged as harshly as the actual murderer? If it could be proven that they did actually intend for the person they were falsely accusing to be murdered, then I think (I'm not sure) then they could actually be charged with conspiracy to murder, in which case they would be able to get a similar sentence. However they may have made the false allegation, but without any conspiracy to murder. While that is still deplorable, it's not on the same level. Please forgive me if I'm waffling here or some of this doesn't make sense, I haven't slept in quite a long time and I'm a bit off at the moment, if I've misconstrued anything or wrongly applied any laws or anything I apologize and will attempt to correct them.

If a woman was on the front lines I believe she should pass the exact same tests that men have to pass - which would mean she'd probably have to do twice the work to get there, because men and women really aren't built the same.  I doubt you'd get any delicate flowers qualifying for front line service, most of them would probably be the type of woman who could knock you out without breaking a sweat.  When I've come across these kinds in work environments (often in security, door-to-door, taxi driving), they tend to be treated equally by their male peers.

Men I think are instinctively protective of those they see as weaker than them - like women have an instinct to go 'OMG!' over small children doing dangerous things - but I don't think most would see the kind of women who'd qualify for front line service as weaker at all.  

Part of the problem with the US forces is that women only need to work half as hard as men to qualify for the same levels of service, so you DO get female peers who are much weaker on the front lines.

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; I reject your shoot vs defuse paradigm. It's not like that at all. We do our best to defuse, and if that fails there's a failsafe of being armed. Some people 'shoot first' but that's an extreme minority. So please don't think the UK culture is all noble and compassionate because you value defusing over killing. We are the same, but we back that up with a safety net, vs hoping/praying that the crazy/drugged/enraged/etc. person is defusable. (Very often they are absolutely not.)

I'm not saying its noble or compassionate, or even necessarily objectively sensible (though obviously it does appear that way to me who's grown up in it). It's just that the British mentality is that if someone who is armed demands something of you, you generally give that to them rather than risk dying trying to protect it. Really, we don't seem to have much of this crazy/drugged/enraged attacker problem.

&gt; Overall, I think that UK society is far more willing to 'play the odds' than we are. Yes, the odds are low that you'd need a gun to defend yourself, but they are not 'lightning strike' low, like they are in Japan. You have PLENTY of violent crime, but you've effectively normalized those levels as acceptable such that it make the odds worth playing. It's as if your russian roulette is just 1 bullet in 100 holes, so it's an acceptable risk, whereas we think that 1/1000 is still not an acceptable risk.

Perhaps. I've never been to the US so I'm not sure how I'd feel there, but as I say I've never had a situation that I think would have been improved were I to be armed. As I said earlier, I'm going to ignore undefined use of the term 'violent crime'.

&gt; We just aren't willing to acquiesce to taking those kinds of chances, with our lives/futures/families.

Yeah - from where we're sitting we take those chances and almost always win. From your perspective it's apparently simply not a chance worth taking. I can see why you might, but I'm happy without the additional responsibility I'd feel were I to routinely carry around a weapon.

&gt; We are wiling to take that extra precaution - and it's quite easy to take. Guns are relatively inexpensive, minimal levels are training are easily achieved, and safe storage is convenient/cheap. We don't obsess about it. We don't spend a fortune. We don't live in fear/paranoia. We're simply prepared for the unlikely.

It's got full armour and all that, but it *is* bright yellow so I only really wear it at night time or in extremely bad weather. The Rayven brand is also unheard of by nearly everyone, which might be a bad thing. I think it costs around £100.

Only last week I got a new jacket, a Spidi Voyager 3. It's got waterproof and thermal liners, the waterproof one you can wear as a seperate coat, or wear it under the jacket rather than fastening it in, which is handy. I got caught in a heavy shower yesterday sans lining and it managed to keep me dry anyway, but it was raining for less than a minute. I haven't tried it with the thermal lining included yet, I expect I will have to before long. I've got quite a lot of faith in it. The only downside is if you want to maintain maximum comfort you do have to stop and add/remove liners. It has a handy pocket to shove them into at least.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"9 or so years ago something similar happened to me.

I bought a house on a counsel estate - most people on the estate where lovely people, but like all estates of this kind there's always one bad apple.

Unfortunately that bad apple moved in to a house next door but one to us.

We had our suspicions early on - she was rough as you like, spots and scars all over her face, she had about 5 kids, all shaved heads (lice?), she was even shaved at one point. A couple of days after they moved in they tarmaced the back garden and let their dogs shit and piss everywhere. The kids would play in it. They had mess everywhere, the front of the house was a tip and so was the back. The later got some rabbits, but they all died in weeks.

Any things started to get bad when the dogs where introduced. They did nothing but bark. All day every day untill around 10-12 at night, and kick off again at 6am.

We phoned citizens advice, was told to basically sell the house and move. The said that they where almost defiantly a ""problem family"" that had been moved to that house to get them out of another area.

After months of this I snapped - looking back I realize how stupid a move this was (well...it might have been a good move). I went over  to the house as nice as can be and asked if its possible to let the dogs indoors sooner rather than let them continue to bark into the night. Things from here got messy - shes swearing, her kids (bless em) are swearing, threats are made (not by me) and the door slams and that's that. I'm kinda stunned I go home.

The next couple of days things got worse - 1st thing was the fact that the kids and mum now have a pellet gun, which for the course of 2-3 hours use it to shoot pellets at my windows. The the next day they see me with a camera (note - Im a keen photographer, I go everywhere with my camera. I think I was loading it into the car at the time) and then the Pedo reference start...

For days/weeks im getting kids shout ""pedo"" over the fence, or even when I walked past their house, the mum too. Get comments about going to ""play parks with my camera to photograph kids"" or shit like ""you wait till your dad hears about the pedo over the fence"" (obviously saying this to her kids - but loud enough for me to hear)

It all seemed so hopeless. We phoned citizens advice again, same advice....Move

So we do. We pop the house on the market, several months later we have sold it.

Best decision I made.

Subsidised by the TV License. And I check iPlayer periodically. Nothing. Actually less content than last year.

&gt;And you get Radio for free.

It's not free, it's assumed enough people are paying for a TV Licence, and so it's bundled in with that. And it's not my cup of tea either. I contribute monthly to SomaFM because it provides an amazing selection of music. The difference between Soma and the BBC, is that Soma have earnt my subscription.

&gt;You don't have to watch live TV you know? 

So it's right that it's all or nothing? I like the occasional show, and my girlfriend likes the football (when terrestrial gets it), even if I do catch 1 program a week, is it fair I should subsidise those that watch all day long?

It's not a fair comparison: the idea of ""value"" is different. BBC has value because of what it does for everyone (apparently), SKY has value because you as an individual think it's worth it. I wouldn't say BT or Sky was worth it, but I don't think the TV Licence is worth it either. If I didn't have to pay a TV License, suddenly SKY has become £12 a month cheaper - increasing my perceived value of it.

Definitely agree with your last point. It's so easy for tabloids to fire out an us-or-them headline and try to convince easily-suggestible people that anyone who DOESN'T think paedophiles should be beaten and burned alive may as well be one, rather than applying some logic.

true,Jamaicaman90,swans1995,1912,"The footballing rivalry rivalry between us and Cardiff is deeply rooted, but it does go further than that.

There have been a few unsavoury incidents throughout the history, particularly in the last 30-40 years, [this incident in 1991](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsEZL3-VTo)being a particularly bad one, where Swansea City Centre was just a battleground for the day (not to say that issues weren't happening when we traveled there as well, because there were).

Hooliganism aside, there's bad blood between the clubs themselves. Former owner and current 'life president' of Cardiff, Sam Hammam, used to [fairly openly support the Cardiff City firm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hooligans/1993938.stm), and taunted not only the club but also the people of Swansea with statements regarding the wealth of the area, going as far as to offer free coaches for our traveling fans as a cheeky way of suggesting that they'd struggle to pay for it themselves.

Players such as [Alan Tate and Lee Trundle](http://i2.bebo.com/042/10/mediuml/2008/10/07/23/1440471244a9087770742ml.jpg) at Swansea, as well as [Jay Bothroyd](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jay-bothroyd-rubbishes-swansea-citys-2068697) at Cardiff, have also flaired up anger between the two clubs.

The Welsh FA and Welsh media have always fanned the flames here as well by showing often quite blatant bias towards Cardiff. There are too many media examples to note (mainly how Cardiff always got the headlines over us even when we had the better story), but particular Welsh FA bias included how often Swansea used to have our bans extended by the Welsh FA interventions we used to have, while Cardiff quite often had them reduced (here being a prime example for [Swansea](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13399709) and [Cardiff](http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/portsmouth-boss-redknapp-slams-purse-ban-over-turn-181795#.Um-g3HC-1Nc) in massively important situations(and look who it is, fucking Mike Dean!)).

Outside of football... well, there's a lot and I don't want to be sat here writing about it all day, but look into the building of the Welsh Assembly Government headquarters (Senedd) as the kind of shit that winds us up here in South West Wales, and also look at how much money has gone into redeveloping Cardiff compared to elsewhere since WW2.

This is a highly shortened and probably highly biased recounting of the rivalry. Other people will have other ideas, and no doubt if you go to ask Cardiff fans you'll get a completely different response.

**EDIT:** And in answer to your secondary question... Don't hate Cardiff just because I've listed a bunch of reasons and because those of us on the terraces do. Keep doing what you're doing and see how you feel. Nothing's worse than a distanced fan who tells you how much he hates 'x' club, but can't really tell you why other than because that's what fans of his team do. I've heard enough Manchester Utd fans from Swansea who claim to 'hate Scousers' to know that you'll come across as a bit of a twat if you copy us blindly!

We can help with the actual money part!

&gt;  I need to make sure I will always have enough money to live on for the 4 years of my degree, unconditionally.

A degree is often only 12 hours teaching a week (seminar+lectures), depending on your degree.. You can get a part time job to augment your income. I worked throughout uni with no issues. Loads of people even have two. This will really help rest your mind of parents blackmail. It will also help finding work after uni.

&gt;Im not very financially aware, so how can I set up a system where I have 2 bank accounts, one with all the money, another with 4 months supply in (so I dont go over budget in the first week) I also need to be the only one with complete control of these accounts. Someone please help

The day (or day after if you are really hungover) you turn 18 do this (that way, your parents don't need to sign/know about your accounts - you may be able to do this age 17, I'm not sure). 

1) Go to bank - an online bank is a good idea here as there's no branch for you to go into.

2) Sign up for current account - cut up (or better yet, freeze the card in a pint of water)

3) Go to second bank.

4) Sign up for second current account.

5) All money goes into current account #1.

6) All bills (including a small weekly online food shop) go out of account #1

7) Set a transfer of X amount leftover minus a percentage for emergencies/savings/unexpected bills (about 10-20%) to account #2 on a weekly, monthly or 4 monthly basis. You could do this manually online if you trust yourself, or set it up automatically.

8) What is in account #2 is available for you to spend without worrying. Using a debit card, cash etc. 

Also, ask your parents for your original documents such as your Birth Certificate, counterpart driving licence, etc. Keep these in a cheap, metal file in your uni house, buried at the back of a wardrobe (fireproof/lockable a good idea too).

Final thought:

Now is a great time to educate yourself about financial stuff. You have the one thing a young person has plenty of: Time. 

Money saving expert has literally saved me thousands of pounds after the bad financial choices I made as a student. Read their guides about credit, budgeting etc - it's an absolutely invaluable tool that I wish I knew about aged 17.

true,Snay,null,null,"Islamic loans have to abide by Sharia Law (although there are a couple of different interpretations, and some people may find one banking product okay, whereas others may not). The fundamental principle is that money is a measure of value of a thing, and not an asset in and of itself, so generating money from money is forbidden, therefore usury (the charging of interest, called Riba in this context) is prohibited. As is investing in products or businesses that are haram, or unlawful, such as pork, alcohol, pornography etcetera. 

Also prohibited is maysir and gharar, derivatives and speculative futures, basically the sort of investments that are tantamount to gambling, where you are betting on a future occurrence, (i.e. the price of oil going up). This also outlaws intangible assets, things that have been made up purely to trade. 

Depending on how devout you are, Islamic loans and Bonds can work differently. For some of the most conservative Muslims the only type of loan that is okay is gift loan or hibah, where you loan £x, and then get paid back exactly £x. The recipient of the loan can choose to gift you a little extra as thanks for the loan, but it is not expected or a condition of giving the loan. So banks may pay a hibah to current account customers in a similar way to interest, but it isn't interest (honest!). 

Sukuk, or Islamic Bonds are different to western bonds in that they constitute ownership of something, as opposed to just a loan of money.  So most Sukuks are fixed term investments in government assets, projects or investments. The issuer sukuk will usually pay a rent to the holder for their usage of the thing, as opposed to direct interest on the money. Once the fixed term expires, the issuer then buys back the share in whatever was invested against.

If you like the occasional show and the occasional football match, then you are still getting way better value than the equivalent from any other broadcaster.

If you want to play with imaginary numbers, how about you spend £12 less a month and then your TV license is free?

You subsidise schools, hospitals and pensions too. Even though you might never get ill, have children or get old. That is the nature of taxes. The TV license is actually a tax you can opt out of if you so choose and still see many of benefits from.

This is assuming you favour a progressive taxation, whereby the rich pay more of a share than the poor.  Corporation tax can only be paid by the productivity, ie the people, either the ones doing the jobs or those consuming the product.  If the former or the latter it is better to have a means tested income tax, it is fairer.

true,Tibbs735,null,null,"No I do not. I like most thing about the UK, but I really detest the degree of gun control we have. I wish we were more like America or at least the Czech Republic. I've posted my views on this before:

""This is probably more to do with me being British, but I am very Pro-gun, as well as pro-individual freedom (Don't read that as explicitly libertarian / right wing though.) I support the kind of system where an adult walks into a shop, with money + ID. After doing what is essentially CTRL + F on a big list of the dangerously mentally ill, as well as those serving time in prison. If they come up clean (maybe after a day or two waiting period) they can buy whatever bearable arm they want, as much ammo as they want. No registration either.

This comes up when someone comments on gun control, expecting me to agree with them, and I state that I disagree. I try not to bring it up as it tends to be a big sticking point with people, even those who consider themselves in favor of free speech, or think themselves to be open minded. 

I just don't think it's appropriate for the state to have that kind of control, and I want to become truly self sufficient eventually, maybe moving abroad, and I view a full ""toolkit"" of guns as a vital part of that, e.g. Handguns for self defence and target practice, a range of rifles in different calibers for hunting and target practice, as well as a shotgun and some sort of magazine fed, military style rifle. That's my controversial opinion.""

But overall, we've got what we've asked for. The majority of British people don't feel the desire to own firearms, which I think is a shame, because the poeple who do want to own them legally are left in the lurch. 

Who knows? Maybe we'll come to regret it one day.

If you don't like any of the current TV provision models for quality TV that exist in the world, none of which exist without paying either a tax somewhere or a subscription charge and normally both, then you are better off watching DVDs. If you take that as a fuck you, I am sorry.

My point about freeview was that if you got rid of the license fee, you would still have to pay a subscription fee in order to access things that your license fee currently pays for. Even pay per view requires you to have either free view or subscription to SKY/BT in order to pay to watch content. 

I would have major qualms about a less independent BBC. With actual Taxes, I believe that NI for example is static. As is VAT. So you are talking about income tax. Which many of the richest avoid anyway. 

Your options are simple and fair imo.

Want to watch live TV, pay a TV license.
Don't want to watch live TV but still want to enjoy hundreds of hours of free content, paid for by everyone else, without adverts, as well as local radio, specialist music and special interest channels and programming, then don't.

Apparently, to satisfy the 'good reason' test, you've basically got to be a vet or RSPCA officer and not just a stalker with a rifle licence, and you'll pretty much only be allowed a single shot .32.

The main reason for this being easier to get hold of that I've heard is that a few muppets have tried to use rifles at fairly close range to despatch deer that have been injured on roads. With the result that a very high velocity round has gone right through the deer's skull, hit the tarmac and sending splintered lead and road surface everywhere. 

With the huge increase in deer numbers and resulting incidents on the roads, it *probably* makes sense for a few more small pistols to be available to deal with them, but that's about it. I'd say that there's maybe a case to be made for .32 single shots to go on the equivalent of a shotgun licence for this reason, but that's about it.

You seriously think that's a viable option for some elderly people? 

&gt;Pensioners in this country are the most provided-for, cosseted, and indulged generation EVER. 

And rightly so. How many of them were shirkers when the benefits system wasn't as generous? 

&gt;They have not had to even bother to save for retirement

Some have. Some haven't. 

&gt;They get free travel (five years before retirement age, for crying out fucking loud, when they should still be bloody working), 

There is no retirement age. The age at which you are eligible for a state pension is 65 for men. For women it is increasing to 65. Plenty of people work well past the age of 65. So your assumption that people with free travel cards don't work is absolute rubbish.

Women are eligible for free travel when they reach state pension age. Men are eligible for free travel when they reach the pensionable age of a woman born on the same day. As the pension age for women is increasing, I don't really see what your problem is.

&gt;free TV licenses, 

Only those over 75 get free licenses. 

&gt;and a ton of other benefits.

What would this ""ton of other benefits"" be?

&gt;If they can't be fucking bothered applying, then stuff them. 

Because that's the way to treat the people that have contributed to the system the majority of their lives...


&gt;The sooner these selfish gits realise that it's not all about them the better.

Simple, but not fair.

Sky/BT are not required pass on subscriber data to the TV Licensing company, so really you can get away with it. I want to be honest.

What are you talking about, ""atrophied democracy""? You realise it's the same way even in the US? Were there a referendum or a vote there, the vast majority would vote for things to stay as they are. Not because they feel strongly about the actual use of guns, but simply because it is engrained in society as a right. There are 1000 other things that are / aren't banned, and you simply group your current situation together and deem it as 'freedom'. Had the US grown more like the UK, guns wouldn't be considered unjustly ""banned"" or a violation of freedoms.

I can be pro-gun in the UK and vote to continue the ban because I can understand the social history of the country, and have a good guess at the impact of introducing such a change. Which is applicable to a wide variety of large scale legal changes within a country, not exclusively to weapons. This is what Llanita is saying, that a vote to *continue* to ban guns isn't necessarily an anti-gun vote. How you conclude that it is indicative of an atrophied democracy is beyond me.

Why are you bringing up the middle east? The law in the US regarding gun law is an example of a status quo, as I explained before. Taking the US and the UK's gun laws into account, surely all you've done is proven that gun control in itself is not as influential a factor as you attempt to portray it as?

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"In Islamic law money can't be earned just for owning money - you have to use the money somehow to generate profit. So there is no interest earned on savings or paid on loans. This principle is also found in the Christian Bible and was enforced until the Renaisance - hence why Jewish financiers - who did charge interest - were scapegoated in the Middle Ages as being unscrupulously profiteering (actually most were barred from working in other sectors and relied on this income.) There are different kinds of Islamic Bonds and most accord with Christian principles as well in terms of their structure and investment portfolios. 

One example - a bank sells bonds to raise cash, instead of deposoting that in a savings account to earn interest they use the money raised to buy office property and they pay out returns to bond holders from money earned on business rents. 

Fixed rate fees on financial instruments are also used as a source of funding - this is considered better than charging interest as costs are upfront and predictable. The libor fixing scandal illustrates how seemingly clear interest rate settings can turn opaque when scrutinised.


The investment portfolios must also adhere to Islamic law which means no investment in alcohol companies, pork companies etc. 

The UK gov. has been considering this since 2007, I worked in this sector in 2009 and learned the demand in the UK was shifting to non-Muslims who wanted simpler terms and conditions on loans and mortgages etc.

However, I was utterly appalled with the way the handgun ban was brought into place. It was a complete knee-jerk reaction to [Dunblane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacre) and MPs who argued for moderation or more time lost their careers and were ignored because the campaigning press labelled them as ""out of touch"". 

I don't think anyone needs to own a handgun. They are devices designed for killing other humans. However, on the few occasions I have done some shooting, it has been great fun. That was rifles and shotguns. We used to be one of the best countries at competition shooting, now, how is anyone going to be able to start with handguns? Sure, a few medals aren't worth people's lives, but there is no reason all hand guns could not be held permanently at gun clubs.

The arguments that we need guns for self-defence are just silly. If a hand gun makes you safer, an automatic makes you safer still and an automatic rifle, even more so. If that is the case, a government has a duty to issue all adults with automatic rifles for everyone's safety. That would be a scary country. 

Take a recent example, the Aurora shooting. Pro-gun people argue that if someone else had a gun in the theatre there would have been far fewer deaths. This is true. However, if 15 people had guns in the darkened theatre with gunfire on the screen (remember it was Batman) then in the confusion it would not be possible to tell whether a person shooting was defending or attacking and you'd have people shooting one another, others caught in the cross-fire, a disaster. 

There is nothing like guns that can escalate a situation. An argument turns into an injury, an injury to a fatality, a single fatality into a mass killing.

I could write a paragraph about how I can't get my head around the US cultural 'blind spot', and word everything as if I was 100% correct like you do, but it wouldn't make it so.

Your reasoning is absurd. Your logic leads to anarchy. Why have any rules regulating firearms for anyone? If it's so basic and weapons equalize the playing field for all, why have any limits? Why are the rules and restrictions in the US, that you personally had nothing to do with, the magical absolute perfect way to do things?

Why doesn't the US use chemical weapons in war?

&gt;Yet the single most powerful tool for such a use is removed from that potential by some kind of cultural 'double speak' that insists that no such valid reality exists.

Seems like you're not using the biggest stick because of cultural double speak? Is the government of Syria wiser than you or yours?

It's amazing how you describe UK views as a bermuda bubble when you can be so narrow minded in your attacks on any non US way of thinking. The rest of the world also isn't quite as you describe. Take a look at Europe. The very argument of using guns is flawed from the ground up. With guns internally or without, the playing field remains even.

true,keizersozei,flair5,,"Since we did so well in getting into, and progressing in the Champs League, our fans have very high expectations. We've also been getting used to ""out-scoring"" our oppositions during the Redknapp era which made for exciting watching....

At the beginning of last season, we lost VDV (still sad about this) and Modric, and gained a new manager had a very different approach. This was a transitional season for us. Before the current season kicked off, we lost our best, and most influencial player, and gained 8 (not incl Rose or Townsend) players who are all expected to shine in our starting 11. This is potentially even more of a transitional season than last year. 

I remember being at the Tromso game a month or 2 ago at the Lane.... We scored 2 goals early in the game and absolutely dominated the game. It was completely 1 sided (we had 17 shots, 10 on target, compared to their 2 shots, 0 on target at full time), but after around 75ish minutes, our fans started to shout and moan when we played the ball back to our defense rather than trying a difficult through ball. 

There is no excuse in booing our own players or staff, and as a group of fans, we are becoming complacent. Victims of our own success and self entitlement. Creating a loud, and happy atmosphere when we're ahead in a game isn't as important. I'm pointing out the blatantly obvious. The blatantly fucking obvious.

My dad, works on an estate in the countryside, very remote location. He was raised rough and ready. A fairly tough man. He owns 2 shotguns, and keeps mine as well. He uses them for pigeon and squirrel shooting and game birds when in season. He's also has a drink problem, but does not become violent (otherwise I would have removed them from him). He's become increasingly paranoid over the last few years, justifiably as there have been numerous intrusions on the estate and theft of expensive equipment. Now in America, a man in that situation would most likely keep his gun by his bed and be intent on shooting the perpetrators. My dad has moved his gun cabinet to the room next to his. He keeps it locked and the guns unloaded. He has notified the local police of the issue, and the first thing he will do if it happens again is call them. The next he will do is get his gun. And load it with the rock salt cartridges he spends time making himself. He could just easily load normal cartridges, and probably maim/kill the intruder. He does not want to. He does not need to. Shooting rock salt at them is his absolute, last resort. He will do everything he can do scare them off/reason with them before threatening them with non-lethal violence. In America he could not do this, because it's likely that they'd be armed and would shoot him. 

Here the summary. My drink-problem, paranoid father, who's rough round the edges, been around guns since he was 12 and was raised the hard way, beaten daily as a child, will still not use lethal force to protect his home and property. He has gone miles out of his way to ensure he doesn't have to. That's the level of aversion British people have to this issue.

It is true that the richest person in the UK (excluding royalty probably) still can't live in the kind of dizzying opulence that the richest person in the US can.

But neither will the poorest person in the UK have to deal with the absolute soul-crushing destitution that the poorest person in the US has to.

We have a different basic social priority compared to you. We are essentially ""socialist"" to an extent, because as a society, we believe that our poorest members should still have everything they need to live. No one should be left to die of sickness or starvation because they couldn't afford to live. And we are happy for the more fortunate members of society to pay for this through progressive taxes.

&gt; if you avoid the ghettos of poverty/crime, you can have the best of both worlds

It seems like you (and seemingly many Americans) would rather just ignore them completely.

Other people from places like the US, Dubai and HK where taxes are low or non-existent come to the UK and complain night and day about how high our taxes are.

British people complain too (because we love to complain about everything) but at the end of the day, the vast majority of us pay our taxes happily in the knowledge that no matter how bad things might get for us down the line or for our children, we will still have the basic necessities for a life. Not an opulent life, but a life nevertheless.

I'm not making any judgement as to who is morally ""right"". God knows that we all wish we could live in the kind of resplendent luxury available to the wealthiest Americans.

I've argued against this stereotype for years, as it's just not true.  Tevez has what you call ""showy workrate"".  It's dishonest.  When he wants the crowd on his side because of a manager fall out or a recent golfing holiday or just moving to a new Club, he runs like a headless chicken which the crowd appreciates.

However, when he actually has to do the conscientious workrate that the crowd doesn't notice so much like covering spaces or pressing an option man, he just stands there.  It honestly drives me daft.

The amount of times that I've seen Tevez not actually do his job defensively on the pitch probably would number into the hundreds.  I remember one game (Norwich away a few years IIRC) where he literally walked around the midfield area whilst they were passing around him and keeping possession which kept the defence really deep.

Tevez is an enormously clever player who knows how to work a crowd and realises that selective memory can leave a really good stereotype/image in people's heads.

true,boomsc,null,null,"Castle Doctrine is *ancient* (hence 'castle') but it's somewhat relevant. In america, castle doctrine doesn't really consider relevant force, you can shoot and kill a burgler and get away with it mostly.

In the UK, Castle Doctrine relies heavily on reasonable force. The case you're mentioning (name escapes me), the farmer defended his home with a shotgun. He shot at the two teenaged burglers, hit one in the back as they were fleeing and killed him. Shooting a teenager in the back as he's already trying to escape is excessive force, and the farmer was convicted of constructive manslaughter (there were other issues to consider that negated outright murder, I believe the teens had been repeatedly stealing from him.)

As I write, I realise this is another very powerful point as to why we *don't* permit a gun culture. Burglars will very rarely carry guns because lethal force is reasonable force in response to a lethal weapon. If you carry a gun, that is designed *only* to kill, it's common knowledge your life stands a very good chance of being forfeit if your victim gets the upper hand. If you *don't* carry a gun, you *might* still die, yes, but the chance is very unlikely, because the victims and homeowners are as aware as anybody that if they accidentally kill you and you're not carrying a gun, they'll likely be convicted of manslaughter instead of being entirely the victim.


If everyone is able to carry guns, that risk is both minimized and amplified. Victims are more likely to be excessively violent in defence, expecting a weapon, and criminals will carry more frequently because they'll be expecting a much greater level of violence regrdless of whether they carry.",0,1383056776,null,0,false,0,cd241li,t3_1pbt8v,t1_cd241li,t1_cd22wa0,null,1428941056,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If they move here, live off benefits, don’t bother learning the language and don't make any attempt to get a job (or if not possible give back in some way e.g. volunteering) then well frankly I don’t see why we should be paying for them. 

In the same way that single mum’s (or dad’s) who live off benefits and keep having kids for the benefits and don’t bother getting a job or give back in some way – why should I be paying for them. 

Of course the above doesn’t cover everyone in those categories – there’s plenty of people who can’t get jobs or are unable to give back in some way. And I don’t consider all single mums in this way – just the ones who are taking the mickey.  

I know there are schemes for people who are here and can’t get a job so they can do some work for someone/in the community and be “paid” in food or training etc and I full support this scheme (we had someone help us paint our house and we paid him in an old laptop with 3G and some food shopping – he worked hard and he earned his way however he could).

However if you have moved here with the intent to get a job and you are working hard to do so then you are most very welcome!

I know  some people who say immigrants “come over here and take our jobs” which is rubbish! Most immigrants come over here and do the jobs most of us don’t want to do (and work darn harder at them!). And if they are trained and get a job then why shouldn’t they have it as long as they can do the job as well (perhaps even better!)

I strongly believe people should learn the language of the country one lives in and there is no excuse not to bother – there are lots of projects out there to help. 

In the short answer – I’d treat them the same as anyone else I meet!

This Thursday (31/10/2013) is the deadline for statements of objection (or support) to the NGT scheme, which will have a major impact on cycling in Leeds. For background, see the website [here](http://www.leedscyclingcampaign.co.uk/?q=node%2F17).
 
The committee will be submitting an objection letter ([download here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/trk0g8901sj4nuz/New%20Generation%20Transport_Objections%20to%20TWAO_DRAFT%20IV.docx)) but to make sure our voice is heard it’s important that members also write individually to raise their objections.

**Must include full name and postal address. at the end.**

&gt;  Re: Transport and Works Act Order for Leeds New Generation Transport – Concerns over Impacts on Cycling
 
&gt;I write to second the objections made by Leeds Cycling Campaign to the proposed scheme.
 
&gt;The Council is ignoring an opportunity to invest in cycling, with the result that provision for cycling has been an afterthought on the most cycled route in Leeds. The business case for NGT is not aligned with council objectives not to increase motorised traffic, and health benefits and costs were disregarded in the business case. Investment in cycling schemes offers a much better return on investment than other transport projects, but cycling alternatives or complementarity were disregarded in the NGT business case.
 
&gt;Segregated space for cyclists, generally recognised as the best way to encourage people to cycle, is not provided. The scheme fails to adopt best practice design from “Manual for Streets 2”, does not comply with guidance document LTN 2/08 regarding width of cycling facilities, and danger to cyclists at ‘pinch-points’ is not mitigated. The design of the scheme is not aligned with the city's cycling strategy and the forthcoming cycle superhighway.
 
&gt;In particular I'm concerned about ...
[**INSERT YOUR OWN SPECIFIC POINTS HERE**]
 
&gt;I urge you to consider the real needs and opportunities for the city, and to encourage Leeds to embrace cycling as part of the solution.

Clearly this incentivises generation companies to generate power in lower-cost locations (which is usually just 'close to the fuel') to help drive margin.

So, those effects are shared across the market.

The 'investments' were in dodgy securities or credit swaps not in actual money making businesses or schemes. 

You're essentially relying on a bank to invest your cut properly which they haven't been doing. The same goes for pension funds. 

So the question remains about interest and whether it is even worthwhile for the consumer. You're paying more for your debt **and** the bank is then investing that money poorly and almost bankrupting the country you live in. Into this scenario comes the Islamic bank which says that interest is forbidden in their religion.

If you have say 30 mates, and lend to them, you know that there is a 50% chance they will ever pay you back.  You lend out £150, half pay back £10 the other half 0, meaning you've got back £150.  You've made no money.

Some would argue that isn't interest, so its OK under sharia law.

The smarter kids would have said *but that's not how it works*.  And this is why we had a **Credit Crunch** because it turns out everyone was working at the same company.  They all got fired on the same day.  Meaning that whilst there was a 50% chance of them paying the loan back.  They all failed to pay it back on the same day.  It was this cross correlation that lead to the panic of the credit crunch, as one bank stopped trusting another, they found that the credit protection they had been buying was worthless, because AIG didn't have enough cash to payout if everyone went bust etc.

The capital that banks had stored in their accounts was barely enough to cover 2% of people defaulting on their loans. Northern Rock for example had only 1.7% capital. This meant if 1.7% of their customers defaulted on mortgages then the business was technically bust. This is what happened to a lot of British banks. Instead of keeping their money back they invested it badly. 

When this scenario occurred they had no money to cover the remainder of the bad loans/mortgages. They went cap in hand to the government for a loan / buyout.

Add into this all the crazy shit with credit swaps, derivatives, securities  or whatever they are called and every bank began to doubt whether any of the others could pay them back.

This was because their spare money was invested poorly into dodgy schemes and packages. Nobody, even the leaders of banks, had a clue who was due what money and when they would receive it. Hence the money market essentially shut down overnight.

As has already been pointed out, if a crime happens in the UK, it isn't very likely the criminal will have a gun with which to shoot anybody. Therefore, situations are far less likely to escalate rapidly. Yes, some criminals are very violent and might well kill you with their bare hands but this is exceptionally rare.

I also think in some sense, your questions is posed incorrectly. In it, you have implied that HM Government has acted without considering the will of the people. This is false as, although once elected the Government is free to write and pass laws, ultimately, the Government is freely elected by the electorate and therefore, each MP sits in Parliament to represent his or her constituents. It therefore follows that the Government is prohibiting ownership of firearms - specifically handguns - because it is the will of the people that it should be as such.

In fact, I could guess with reasonably accuracy that if I took a snap poll at work right now by asking the question ""do you wish you could own a handgun?"" almost all of my colleagues would say ""no"" and this would in fact, broadly speaking, align with the wider UK population's view.

And besides, shotguns can be owned in the UK with the correct licensing - don't forget that everybody and their mum is packing in the country.

In spite of his pace, he was overrun several times in the Chelsea game and while Fernando Torres isn't exactly slow, it was the manner in which he got past Clichy and put that cross in. This cross became the assist for Chelsea's first goal and I think this suggests he is not the Clichy we once knew anymore.

In my opinion, it's time to give Kolarov an extended run as first-choice LB. Right now I'd rather have his dead-ball delivery than our pacy Clichy, seeing as he can't even seem to use that pace anymore.

Not only that, but Kolarov, from what we've seen, seems the more consistent now, and with us needing to get a hold of things in our away games, I can only imagine that Kolarov would provide us with a better shot at pulling in the away points.

I think they make perfect sense in themselves without being compared to that - but I agree with your points that the *impact* of those bills on people depends on their purchasing power. 

I don't have the data to hand to crunch those numbers in detail, but given that energy is cheaper in the UK than the average EU15 and EU27 prices I suspect that the overall numbers would not show energy bills to be significantly more of a burden on British households than the average in the EU27 or even the EU15. 

Purchasing power in British households is [more than 20% above the EU27 average](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114), so if Brits have higher purchasing power and lower prices it doesn't take much to deduce that Energy bills are probably not as big of a burden on UK households unless they use a lot more energy than their European counterparts. And whilst energy usage is [higher than average, it's not by that much](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65964/1524-eu-energy-efficiency-household-trends-art.pdf).

But at the same time, I do understand the concerns of some Spurs fans, because at the moment our football isn't very fluid and we're struggling to break teams down and create chances. Our wins against Hull and Palace were due to two very, very dodgy penalty decisions. We have lost Bale, but we've invested heavily in a lot of attacking talent and yet we often look toothless. 

A lot of Spurs fans think this is due to the influx of new players and that once they've settled in, we will be tearing teams apart. I'm not so sure. It seems to me that it's affected us since AVB took over. Last season we really didn't open teams up and were reliant on Bale to score wonder goals for us. AVB's tactics seem to involve a very defensive central midfield, pacy wingers and a lone target man. There doesn't seem too much focus on patiently working the ball through midfield and really slicing teams open. The good thing about this tactic is that defensively we've never been better. We are much, much harder to beat than we were under Redknapp. The downside is that I cannot see where the goals are going to come from, and we're not much fun to watch. As someone who has supported Spurs for many years, I'm used to us playing attacking football and conceding stupid goals. AVB's tactics seem to be a pretty serious change to the Spurs DNA and it is taking some time to get used to. 

To be honest, I haven't seen that many Spurs fans whining that our football isn't pretty enough or that AVB doesn't know what he's doing. It's more a genuine concern that we really aren't creating many chances and we don't know where the goals are going to come from.

Personally, I got my full deposit back most of the time, on one occasion I lost a bit for cleaning, and some kind of plumbing issue but it wasn't enough to make a fuss about it. 

Just make sure they give you an inventory that you all sign off on, and take photos if you want - definitely take photos if they don't give you an inventory. When it comes to the end of the year, if you leave the house in decent order then you will get your deposit back. If stuff goes wrong during the year I would recommend emailing rather than calling them so there is a record of your correspondence. 

Apart from that, there's little they can fuck you over on. I've personally never had a visit/inspection during the year from the landlord/letting agency, but pretty sure they have to give 24/48 hours notice. Some agencies do have quite high admins fees/holding fees, and some will ask for the equivalent of 6 weeks rent as a deposit. The fees are unavoidable unless you have a private landlord maybe, and if it's a house you definitely want then you'll end up paying the fees.

true,guernican,null,null,"&gt; Simply put, energy bills are less of an issue for UK households than for the average European one. 

Actually, this is starting to get quite interesting... I've just been looking at [2013 consumption data](http://www.energy.eu/). The UK is, almost across the board, one of the lowest consumers per household, less than Spain and Italy, for example.   

Anyway, I digress. To your point about energy bills not ""being an issue"" for UK households... would you say that was the sense you get, in general? Living in a reasonably diverse area, both economically and culturally, I know of plenty of cases where people struggle to pay their energy bills. 

Reading the executives from the energy companies getting their grilling from the Commons select committee today, I also found it interesting to note the delineation between the generation business and retail business. People on here have pointed out that energy companies make a profit of less than 10% on retail of energy (supermarkets make much higher margins, for example) yet the generation arms of the business traditionally clear a profit of 17-23%. 

I guess what it all comes down to, for me, is this. Energy as an essential service to maintain life, and quality of life, is now sold as a commodity. And commodities sell at what the market will sustain. That, ultimately, is a problem.

remember to do your book project responsibly. It may seem a good idea to do the whole project at once. BUT too much too soon can be a bad experience. try just one very small sentence ( 4 or 5 words)  and wait for an hour or two to see how you feel( the impact of words can vary however you measure them) . If after and hour or two hours your small sentence does nothing for you,  try a slightly larger sentence. however, if your small sentence leaves you happy leave the rest of writing for another week. There's no need to over do it, become competitive or try and reach some literary high. It might also be a good idea to have a buddy who's not involved in your book project to supervise. Even a small sentence can be a lot of fun. but be warned even a small sentence can effect you for over 6 hours so start at 7 pm if you want to get to bed at a decent hour.  also put the phone away as you might be tempted to tell people about how good your book project is. Finally before you start you book project get a decent meal down you and have plenty of fluids to hand.

true,sionnach,irish,Filthy foreigner,"&gt; To your point about energy bills not ""being an issue"" for UK households...

I don't mean ""not an issue"" - they clearly are for a lot of people. I mean ""less of an issue than to the average European household"". I hear from people that they seem to think UK customers are getting particularly shafted compared to the rest of Europe, and that just isn't the case as shown by the numbers. Are we all getting shafted right across Europe? - that's a more difficult question to answer. I'm just trying to make the point that the UK does quite well compared to the rest of the market, really.

I'm absolutely sympathetic to people who struggle to afford to pay their energy bills. I don't think it's right that the green taxes are effectively regressive by being tacked on to the bill - I would prefer that more affluent people (although far from loaded, I'd categorise myself in that class) pay more to help reduce energy dependence by the country as a whole. I don't think energy firms are angels, far from it. But they're not the only part of the problem - government policy is a huge piece of this, so at the end of the day I think the prevailing view of ""the energy firms are all bastards, and the source of all our energy price problems"" is just so incredibly wrong and actually counterproductive.

Of course, ultimately, companies are going to pass these things onto consumers, but that takes me all the way back to my starting point on this argument... that we were stupid to sell off, rather than reform, our energy in the first place. 

I can sympathise to an extent with the argument that blaimg the energy companies for all of this is counter-productive, but my experience of private enterprise is that they cannot be trusted to do the right thing by anyone other than their shareholders. This wouldn't matter, as such, if we weren't talking about something that people rely on to keep them alive.

No. But this is not about them. Depending on circumstances and benefit entitlement, they may be eligible for the cold weather payment.

Government cuts have reduced help available and there are plenty that slip through the cracks.

true,FoolOfFools,null,null,"I've been reading the back-and-forth posts on this thread for some time now and I think (I hope) I might be able to pin point and hopefully further explain the differences of opinion (btw, I'm not from the UK or the US and I'm still formulating an opinion on gun laws, but I'm leaning to the anti side....just so you're aware of any bias I might have).
    
From what I can see, there's a difference of opinion regarding what level of protection is necessary when defending against a threat. According to OP, a gun is a legitimate solution because there are no 'maybes', you're taking the most direct and absolute route to determining your and your loved ones' safety. Have I gotten that correct?
    
On the other side, the UK feel like that's an unnecessary amount of protection, that it escalates the violence of the end result unnecessarily. Moreover, they feel that the 'gun culture' is not present in UK and therefore not an issue. Nobody has it, so nobody needs it. Am I okay on that score as well?
    
Now, I'm going to see if I can explain to OP the UK's position (since that's where my bias lies) using a situational example (assuming I understand their perspective correctly).
    
If I were to rely on your original example of the crazy guy with the knife, maybe you should put it into context of each location and the accompanying laws. In the US, I believe it's a natural reaction to want to go for the gun to protect yourself. However, here's where I find myself curious. If a crazy guy surprises you in your home, how are you going to have time to grab your gun before he stabs you? Depending on your answer, I think it will lead to one of my two next points.
    
First, if you have time to go run for a gun, then I believe you would have time to also run away, in which case you don't need a gun. That's one of the points one redditor tried to make. Second, if you're worried about your family, then trying to get a gun will still have problems, such as them being taken hostage.
    
My next point. In the US, the biggest problem with your scenario (as far as I can tell) is that there's a greater chance that the crazy guy will also have a gun, in which case you not only have smaller chance of your gun being effective, but you also have a smaller chance of being able to run away.
    
In the UK, however, with neither side having a gun, of course the possibility of danger still exists, but the alternative you suggest carries much higher risks with it as well.
    
That leaves me with a final question: Can you give me a scenario where, according to your pro-gun laws and bearing in mind the situational risks I mentioned above, someone would be able to effectively defend themselves without there being a higher risk for everyone involved? Where the risk is only applied to the attacker?
    
I'm obviously taking huge leaps in assumption here, so feel free to point out holes in my example. Also, I don't know very much about this topic, I'm only speaking based on what I've gleaned from this thread and elsewhere, so please excuse any ignorance I might have accidentally spewed.",0,1383069820,null,0,false,0,cd29k75,t3_1pbt8v,t1_cd29k75,t1_cd1mtub,null,1428938482,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We were mid table, and while not an easy target teams knew they could try and pick us off.

Now after a few years of consistent performance and challenging for the top 4, it takes a lot more balls to turn up and aim to leave with a scrappy win. Previously we were not a team you would park the bus against and settle for a draw and now we are.

Previous years have seen teams turn up to games home or away thinking ""We can make a real go of this and get 3 points"" these days they turn up and think ""Fuck this shit, lets just shut up shop, put up the hurricane protection and hope for the best.""

We are not used to this yet, it's a new experience. We are feared by these teams now, and to be fair to them, they are doing an exceptional job at defending as well.

Firstly you'd have to write a letter (yes, write) to your ISP requesting cancellation for no fee as a worker had admitted on a call on such and such a date that the service was overloaded.

Next you'd have to wait a week. You'll probably not get a response. Then you'll have to write another letter. Wait another week.

Then write yet another letter - this time suggesting you'll take the case to the small claims court for the cancellation fee if they don't comply within a certain time.

Now this may or may not have the desired effect. If not then your choice is to take it to a County Court - and you'll have to employ a lawyer to do this. Chances are it is cheaper for you to pay for another two years to your ISP than hire a lawyer for one court case.

true,CanistonDuo,cnty-england,England,"&gt;The article being discussed is about child poverty. Why the double standard?

There is no double standard. I was making a point in relation to a specific benefit for a specific claimant. That being the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. 

&gt;Why is it necessary for some benefits, but not others?

To ensure that only those eligible for them, claim them. 

&gt;You're right that we spend more on means testing than on the actual benefits themselves.

That would depend on the benefit. 

&gt;So, why the double standard? 

Again, there is no double standards. 

&gt;Don't poor children deserve a warm home as much as a well-off pensioner does?

Indeed they do. If the parents aren't eligible for a cold weather payment because of the child's age then depending on their income they may be eligible for help from their supplier to the tune of about £135.

Did I present it as a ""great solution""? 

&gt;the very point of tax avoidance is that we literally can't get at that money because it's left the country,

Do you have any idea at all what you are on about? I linked to an article about UNPAID tax which covers more than just tax avoidance. 


EDIT: If you want an idea that works then we could quite simply remove the entitlement from anybody that pays the higher rate of tax. That means less than half a million pensioners would not get their £200 winter fuel allowance and it could easily be done based on their tax code.

- You can't use the argument that the defender will have more skills and training because both you and the attacker have access to the same methods of training. Saying that  'Most criminals have cheap, crappy guns, w/ cheap ammo in them. And they can't shoot for shit...no skills/training' is a cop out in this context, since we're speaking about the relevance of gun laws in a generic location such as the UK (I won't comment on your saying that regarding your own society since I don't know if what you're saying is statistically true or untrue). Assuming the UK were to allow gun laws, then everyone would have potential access to the same methods of training and guns/ammunition.
    
- Lastly, you're comment with regards to the liberty philosophy. That kind of reasoning can be applied to anything. I'll use a specific example: Why do we ban drugs? It makes people happy, but it does them harm. Is the state 'nannying' them by not allowing them to indulge for their own good? It's not like they're harming anyone else except themselves through their own choice (I'm deliberately being flippant here to make a point, not to be stupid or sound insulting).

I completely agree, Garcia at CB is always my greatest fear, I couldn't care less about LB when faced with that man as our CB, even if MP played Joe Hart at LB.

Discounting our very unlucky injuries at CB, I think we do have some good depth there, the problem is that Kompany seems to have substituted his groin with glass.

As you rightly say, Kolarov, even when in-form, does not compare to Clichy when he's fit, ready and playing well.
What I don't understand is how we're even HAVING problems at LB, they're both in their prime, pretty much, Kolarov at 27, Clichy at 28 years.

Maybe, just maybe, we oughta bring in an understudy soon who's got loads of potential, think Luke Shaw. Of course, this is just me perhaps jumping the gun a bit too soon, it's not like this has been a persistent problem, but if it lasts, I think it should be seriously considered come January.
My dream scenario would be Alaba joining us, he's my first buy every time I play FM with City, haha! Top class prospect at such a young age, the kid's even won the CL.

**In summary I look at it like this:**

* Defence is our biggest problem in the squad.

* Discounting injuries at CB, LB is, for me, the biggest weakness for us right now in defence.

* Both our LBs are in their prime, but the most talented one has forgotten he's in his prime, and the least talented one, well, him in his prime is (and this is maybe a harsh opinion) still not something I'd call a first-choice LB worthy of a team expecting 5 trophies in 5 years.

* The solution to this is possibly a young lad with potential, challenging for first-choice LB, Alaba being the impossible dream and Luke Shaw perhaps being a bit more within our reach.

Then again, I'm thinking too far ahead, it really seems like a bit of a luxury problem that will solve itself in the end.",0,1383076750,null,0,false,0,cd2coau,t3_1ph0jv,t1_cd2coau,t1_cd29soc,null,1428936959,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3

* **House prices**: Based on the latest ONS house price index, UK house prices were 3.8% higher in August than they were a year earlier (and, excluding London, only 2.2% higher). As a comparison, during the period from Q3 1996 to Q1 2008 (i.e. both earlier and later than just the worst excesses of the last bubble in 2003-4 and 2007), house prices rose at an average rate of 11% a year; and for only three quarters during that time (between Q3 2005 and Q1 2006) did they grow by less than they current rate of 3.8%.

* **Mortgages**: As the Guardian article correctly states, there were 66,735 mortgage approvals in September, the highest since February 2008. But February 2008 was not a high point for the mortgage market. The Bank of England publishes this monthly data series going back to April 1993 (i.e. a point when the market was still feeling the effects of the early 1990s recession). Between April 1993 and February 2008, the number of mortgage approvals per month averaged 98,000 *and at no point was it ever as low as it is today*.

I think if people want to shout 'bubble', they should understand the context. Real GDP today is still lower than it was five years ago, let alone where it should be today if it weren't for the recession.

No. I linked to a Guardian article hoping you'd have the intelligence to figure out that HMRC fail to collect much much more than is actually given to pensioners by way of fuel payments.

Indeed it is. That doesn't mean it is ideal. Particularly given the number of pensioners it will affect.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Thing is, a 'narrow diamond' 4-4-2 exposes us even more in wide areas than a 3-5-2. At least with the 3-5-2, if the opposition get in behind the wing backs and two CM's, the closest CB can step out and deal with them as a fullback would.

If you watch the buildup to West Brom's goal, Kelly's out of position, but Kolo ends up jockeying the winger as a fullback would do, and Skrtel &amp; Sakho take up the positions of a CB duo in a back four. (It's a legit example because that should never have been a goal)


With the narrow diamond 4-4-2, those fullbacks still need to get forward, but if they're beaten, then we've suddenly only got two CB's, and you can't have one step out as readily. You mentioned having the DM drop back to turn it into a back 3 when necessary, but even making that small transition requires time, and thus leaves a window in which we're very open and vulnerable.

Rodgers has said one of the great things about the 3-5-2 is the way it encourages us to overload the opposition centrally in their final third - get SAS in 2 vs 2 situations against the opposing CB's on counterattacks, before their fullbacks get back into position. It also helps us avoid the same thing happening to us by having 3 CB's. Switching to the narrow diamond 4-4-2 would create the very problem for us that we're trying to foist on other teams.

Where does this leave Coutinho? Who knows. Glad I don't have to deal with that headache. ",0,1383077528,null,0,false,0,cd2d11p,t3_1phbbv,t1_cd2d11p,t3_1phbbv,null,1428936794,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

&gt;SAGA ran a campaign to get people to donate if if they didn't need it in order that it be given to those that do. I'm sure Google will provide you more info.

&gt;You think that laughing at people dying is less ignorant than pointing out problems?

yes, it is more ignorant than sarcasm. lol.

&gt;As opposed to being devoid of any facts and spouting random nonsense?

except for the fact that iv not even said a thing that was incorrect, you on the other hand have pointed out a biased and incorrect article about something entirely unrelated, a correct but irrelevant article stating the figure spent on WFA, and an article about non benefit claimant figures that was intrigueing but not exactly important. apparently not agreeing with left leaning socialist opinion is no spouting random nonesense. TIL.

&gt;No. I linked to a Guardian article hoping you'd have the intelligence to figure out that HMRC fail to collect much much more than is actually given to pensioners by way of fuel payments.

wrong again my foolish friend. wrong again. HMRC do not fail to collect anything because it is not written down in that annoying little rulebook we like to call the law that it is due to be collected, and for that matter what they are failing to collect doesn't match any academic definition of tax due. what the article says is that some companies are not paying 23% of what the guardian has arbitrarily decided are the profits of these companies based on a misinterpreted definition of profit, as well as few choice things about the current government, but I guess I am pretty stupid for hoping that someone might do some research beyond reading their favorite left leaning newspaper.

&gt;Indeed it is. That doesn't mean it is ideal. Particularly given the number of pensioners it will affect.

this is the solution you gave after condemning me as an imbecile for supporting a means testing, what this says to me is that you actually have no solutions and hope that if you repeat your insistence that what you have cited is relevant and attempt belittle my views enough I will eventually give up talking to a wall, which is true enough and something I am close to doing.",0,1383079017,null,0,false,0,cd2dp7x,t3_1pgdpk,t1_cd2dp7x,t1_cd2cxpf,null,1428936480,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,nephos303,null,null,"In this you used the idea of a Navajo living on a reservation. I am from the uk, and can only guess at what this situation is like. I have read that there are some areas where alcoholism is crippling. the difference between guns and alcohol is enormous. alcohol can destroy families, lives, and be fatal if drunk driving but with guns it is much easier to be fatal, a slip of the trigger or safety catch and it can lead to death. I read today over in r/askreddit that a high school student put a gun with a blank in it to his head and promptly blew his brains out on stage(the NSFW school thread).

 I am also lucky because my school runs a CCF, combined cadet force, the ""army"" for High school students. I have had the privilege of holding an A 80 assault rifle, the cadet training version. With this I have been able to fire blank rounds with the correct blank firing attachment, I hope to be able to fire live rounds on a military range some time next year. I however have been made to make legal declaration when leaving the area we have been firing in that I have no rounds in my poses ion. The guns i have been using are owned by the army and I have been warned that if one were to be unaccounted for the local area would effectively have to go into shut down until the gun was found. My dad owns an air rifle. he keeps this at home with a trigger lock on it. it would be no use in home defense except as a club, hardly its intended purpose. This gun is mainly used for shooting pigeons and occasionally targets we set up. The uk law on this seems very liberal, you can fire the gun when you are 14 and are more than 50 yards from a public byway.

The poster above highlights some points i agree with such as the ease a gun allows suicide to be done at. It is also felt by young men such as my self ( I have discussed this with them after seeing your interesting post) that there is little need for a gun. in one of your earlier posts you mentioned that young men always want guns. this is true to a degree, but whilst it is awesome,in the original sense, to hold a gun, the potential damage done with it is huge and this is emphasized. 

I also feel that when someone owns a gun it makes me feel less safe, the more you feel that you need a gun, the more you need a gun. take this scenario: If i know that 10% of people are carrying a concealed gun i feel that that 10% has a huge potential advantage over me. I then feel that i need a gun so that they do not have an advantage over me. if people feel like this then quickly more and more have this, it eventually becomes redundant. its like highlighting a whole piece of text, if it is all highlighted, none of it is.

 Also what if i'm shot from behind? what can i do to stop that? If i go to draw my weapon but whilst i am doing that i myself am shot, what use is my gun now? as someone who as thankfully never been shot and hopefully never will, i feel that my idea of what a gun shot would do is probably totally stop me, even if it was a limb that was hit. i have heard from someone that was shot with a plastic bullet, one that is fire like a standard one but is only plastic can break bones and totally debilitate someone.

whilst i appreciate your extensive posting on this subject, i feel that you have not quite grasped the British mentality that guns are for killing, hunting(killing of a sort) or target shooting and that the vast majority would rather not have guns on the streets. i would also recommend that you look at the recent British case in which a man killed an intruder with a knife and the resulting argument over how he should be charged.",0,1383079027,null,0,false,0,cd2dpe9,t3_1pbt8v,t1_cd2dpe9,t1_cd0w1in,null,1428936478,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Americans needed an influx of immigrants, England also needed more immigrants at certain points in History.

The situation has changed, we have a welfare system for one...for every job a Brit can't get, that's potentially an extra Brit on welfare. You can argue they should be better or they are lazy...but whatever the reason the result is another Brit on welfare. That's money out of everyone's taxes, money that could even be invested in creating jobs.

On the other hand more immigrants actually create more jobs, they are buying stuff as well.

Wages are also affected by immigration. There's a balance between lower wages so businesses thrive and wages that get so low people can barely live. You must have seen how expensive bills, food, rent/houseprices are now? A record number of people are visiting food banks too.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24536817

If Mexicans in America stopped 'picking food' and were slowly transitioned out will America suddenly starve? Again not as simple as that, they may have to pay american's more money to work, and the price of food will rise again, but wouldn't lower paid workers now have more money? Less wage inequality?

Also note that some people work and send money 'back home'. That is money that is not being spent in this country. The money multiplier effect be damned

Nothing I am saying is an absolute statement for or against immigration, there are other factors too, but each situation is unique and each situation is going to have it's own optimal level of immigration.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"I'm a Brit but with lots of Polish relatives. To be honest, traditional Polish food tends to be on the stodgy side, the traditional image of meat, potatoes and cabbage isn't that far off the mark.

That having been said, if you ever get the chance to try homemade bigos (pronounced ""BEE-goss"") then don't turn it down. It's a stew of meat, cabbage and sauerkraut but tastes far better than it sounds. It's probably the closest thing to a Polish national dish -- every family will have their own recipe. But ignore the bigos they sell in tins and jars, it's awful, you only ever want to have homemade stuff.

Other than that, pierogi are nice: they're similar to ravioli but usually a bit larger and filled with (surprise!) cabbage, or mushrooms. The pasta/pastry is usually quite cloying which can be a bit unpleasant for someone used to a more traditional Italian style pasta. They're worth trying, though.

Polish meats are good. Sopocka (prounounced ""so-POTS-ka"") is my personal favourite, it's like a lean, heavily-smoked ham. There'll be a huge variety of thin dried sausages (kabanosy, pronounced ""kab-a-NOSS-ee"") that look a bit like peperami, they're usually pretty good, and also plenty of fat German-wurst-style sausages.

Beyond that there's lots of fish, especially herrings which you can get in pickling vinegar (kind of like rollmops) and in sour cream.

 I have some questions about Liverpool. I grew up in Southport and always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with Liverpool. My early memories of visiting Liverpool as a teenager was the rawness of Liverpool compared to Southport, I got attacked a couple of times (for no reason) so that sort of put me off Liverpool for a while. But later on I think I grew to find Liverpudlians somewhat of a special breed with a cracking sense of humour, and a real down-to-earth attitude and openness I don't think you find anywhere else (actually I haven't lived in the UK for 10 years).  

I visited  Liverpool 2 years ago and I was surprised to see how it has changed in the last 20 years, my memories are of wasteland dockyards and industrial decay, but I saw wind power, modern hotels, high end shopping (and probably one too many Greggs shops). Anyway it seems like Liverpool has made some serious efforts to lift itself and change its image. But my question is really, what is it that has caused Liverpool and it's culture to be so unique? I have puzzled over that for some years.

Your energy is going to be expensive if it is going to fund needed investment.  The government pretend to help, but really they are part of the problem.

Government planning laws make adding new capacity an extremely difficult undertaking, even for the likes of wind farms which have negligible environmental impact.  Our massive offshore tide and wind resource are heavily controlled by the government as they are the owner, planning authority, and eventually could levy ""windfall taxes"".  Large amounts of capacity is held up because of a lack of grid connection due to other parts of the government.


What we need is  to make it easier to build new renewable capacity.  Give interest free loans for rooftop solar (bills go down).  Build more wind farms in England and give a share of the profits to local people (bills go down).  Let farmers make money from wind and solar sites on their land instead of blocking them.

DAE THINK TEAM OF THE WEEK SHOULD BE ALL ARSE-ANAL PLAYERS??? OMG LOOK AT DAT CLASS AND BEAUTIFUL FOOTBALL!

10 Changes and we beat you with our B-team 2-0 at your home ground infront of your Arsenal youth enclosures created due to the excessive amount of 12 year old Xbox fifa kids becoming gooners also currently dominating /r/Soccer. Even the ref felt sorry for you and decided to give you chances halfway through. We know it is very hard but can you kindly shut the fuck up about your 'amazing players' and how all of them deserve to win the best player awards when your only nominee is there because he played for another team. Watch another club play every once in a while and you will realize exactly where on the ladder you stand.

Know your place Arsenal scum. This wasn't even our final form. We already beat the best team in England.

Maybe someone can settle my worries by telling me managers never stay than long for any team anyway? Was Ferguson just a once in a long time kind of deal?",0,1383082836,null,0,false,0,cd2fdr0,t3_1ph51g,t1_cd2fdr0,t3_1ph51g,null,1428935696,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

&gt; Guy Fawkes Night, also known as Guy Fawkes Day, Bonfire Night and Firework Night, is an annual commemoration observed on 5 November, primarily in Great Britain. Its history begins with the events of 5 November 1605, when Guy Fawkes, a member of the Gunpowder Plot, was arrested while guarding explosives the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords. Celebrating the fact that King James I had survived the attempt on his life, people lit bonfires around London, and months later the introduction of the Observance of 5th November Act enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure.

We are most definitely celebrating the foiling of the plot.  Traditionally, Guy Fawkes / Bonfire Night includes a tradition called The Burning of the Guy, which involves building an effigy of Fawkes to be burnt on the bonfire.  Many Britons find it very strange that Americans would see Fawkes as a hero, it's amusingly ignorant (in the uninformed / naive sense) of you.  [The Gunpowder Plot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot) aimed to kill the head of state and replace them with somebody else in order to change the way the country was run, with most of parliament as collateral damage.  If it happened today, people would be throwing around the T word like it was going out of fashion.

In reality, Guy Fawkes / Bonfire Night has become more of an opportunity for a bit of a party than to celebrate a particular event, in much the same way Christmas has been secularised.  Few people would be able to give you more than the most sketched out overview of what happened.  Guy Fawkes is, perhaps, not seen as the villain he once was, but he is most certainly not a hero.",0,1383083476,null,0,false,0,cd2fnrf,t3_1phqyl,t1_cd2fnrf,t3_1phqyl,null,1428935566,32,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,32

Also I think you need to re-emphasise how important it is for your parents **not** to pay the fees upfront, it is essentially wasting thousands. They behave completely different to commercial loans, and to be honest, behave more like a graduate tax if anything. Here's why -

- Student loans have no effect on your credit rating.
- Repayments are proportional to income, if you earn less than £21000, you don't pay. It gradually increases as you earn more. 
- After 30 years the debt is wiped if it is not fully paid already.
- If you lose your job or take time off, you stop paying the repayments, since you have no income.
- The interest rate on the loans are so low, any spare money you have is better off invested or put into a savings account, rather than paying off the debt.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Yes clearly we should claw back benefits from pensioners who have earned them with a lifetime of tax

Except they haven't, which is entirely the point.

Pensioners are living far longer and in far better health than ever before and all the tax and NI they paid does not cover the cost of all the cash that is thrown at them, nowhere near it in fact.

It's people like me and you - who are working NOW - that is paying the most to support them and who will benefit the least when OUR time comes to retire.

It's utterly ridiculous that all pensioners get free bus passes and winter fuel grants when such benefits should be restricted or targeted at those that actually need them.

As an example, someone who is on a generous private pension has absolutely no need for a winter fuel grant whereas someone who has to rely on the state pension topped up with pension credit probably does, so why would we automatically pay it to both of them when it should be assessed on need?

Likewise with free bus passes; when I'm trying to get to work in the morning to pay for said bus passes, why should I have to share room on the bus with some pensioner who is off on a jolly or out doing their shopping at 08:00?

Why can we not restrict free bus passes for pensioners to only be valid out with of core commuting hours?

Nobody is saying that we should take every single penny off every single pensioner, but when the majority of the welfare budget goes to pensioners (rather than the unemployed or the disabled) then we really do need to take a step back and have a long, hard think about whether so-called universal benefits really should be universal at all.",0,1383085112,null,0,false,0,cd2gc59,t3_1pgdpk,t1_cd2gc59,t1_cd2g3za,null,1428935250,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Mods could take down + np the post, and warn or even ban offending parties if needed. They could also post in their green-font handles and warn the community not to do this, whether or not that will have an impact in the short term. They can also filter posts going forward, so stuff like this doesn't easily hit the front page. There is a lot they can do. The matter is whether they are willing to do anything about it, or endorse it by not doing anything about it.

The admins can address it more directly because they have a transparent view of post voting, and can disable votes + accounts on their end. I messaged them as well, and did not receive a response, though I wouldn't expect one so quickly for obvious reasons.

Did you go to a Welsh medium school? You should see the state of the way Welsh is taught in English medium schools. I speak a couple of languages and have a degree in a language field, and I feel I can say with some authority that not only is the Welsh method broken and entirely different from the way other languages are taught, but it is also so unintuitive and forced that it breeds resentment quite easily (and this is coming from a Welsh man who is both patriotic and loves linguistics).

Their post match thread is so beautiful (edit: despite a reasonable tone overall here are some gems)

**☑** 'if we played a better team we would have won' despite us playing our B team

**☑** 'don't care' attitude about the league cup, will be repeated as they're knocked out the FA cup and CL

**☑** calling arsenal one of the two biggest clubs in europe

**☑** actually complaining about the cup drawing system

Of course such a conflict is as unrealistic as it would be one-sided, so this sort of thing really isn't a justification for gun ownership. There are many examples of police overreach or incompetence killing innocents, and as of yet, as far as I know no one has been roused into organised resistance to deter them.

Yes, the older people don't tend to celebrate as much. I know we're meant to celebrating Guy Fawkes failing to blow up the houses of parliament but, as others have said, we do use it as an excuse to go out and have a good time. The fire shows that they have in cities seem to be aimed at families and the younger generation, if older people do go out, they will more likely go to a smaller bonfire at the local pub or village hall rather than the big ones. Some people choose to let off fireworks in their gardens and have a barbecue or something, so I suppose the older generations could do that, but really bonfire night seems to be more for the children, in fact I know a lot of older people who don't bother.",0,1383086303,null,0,false,0,cd2gtgn,t3_1phqyl,t1_cd2gtgn,t3_1phqyl,null,1428935026,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

true,surprisecloset,lfc68,,"Let's not pretend we're BR, but since this is the internet and we can make boastful claims without facts, let's go! The way I'd look at this is what are our assets?

Backfield
We have a few good CBs and two good wingbacks when healthy. Since Enrique is out and I don't trust Cissokho yet, it may make sense to go four in the back against heavy opposition like the Gunners, with Kolo and Johnson out wide and Skrtel/Agger and Sakho in the middle.

Midfield
Gerrard and Lucas are stalwarts which means we have Hendo, Coutinho and Moses as legitimate contenders for the remaining two spots. But as someone rightly pointed out, a diamond shape really crowds the middle and leaves our backs exposed if they go on the offense.

What if we moved to a 4-2-3-1 formation though and move Suarez to the the midfield, leaving Sturridge as the lone striker? This opens it up for the midfield to look like Gerrard and Lucas as the DMs and Suarez, Coutinho and Henderson as AMs, with Coutinho in the 10 position.

Admittedly, I'm not an expert on tactics (flame on!) but this seems like a nice compromise until we can get Enrique back.

Why would BO mods take down the linked post? The post it links to is an incredibly insightful look at the differences in gun culture between the UK and US. It may breadcrumb users to this thread, but that's so far out of the mods control it's a silly notion. Unless you mean the /r/UK mods taking down this post, and why would they? OP may have been guilty of ""cross posting to other subreddits to gain support and upvotes"", but apart from that I hardly see it as breeching the subreddit rules. Apart from a few people and the brigading, most of the actual discussion I've has been fairly civil - taking down the post on that basis alone is silly.  

I'm not entirely aware of mods capabilities, but are they even capable of seeing who has downvoted/upvoted certain posts? Given that most people downvote as an alternative to replying, it's hardly a reasonable request for them to go through every post to do so. Imagine if they had to do that for every controversial post? It'd be the workload of a full-time job.

I agree about them green-fonting warning people against brigading, but I'm highly dubious about the actual effect of that.

&gt;They can also filter posts going forward, so stuff like this doesn't easily hit the front page

The BO mods have no obligation to filter posts like the one that breadcrumbed people to this one, given that it was only consequentially related to this thread. And given that OP's post is sitting at a resounding net karma of '0', it's not likely to be nearing the front page.

&gt;The matter is whether they are willing to do anything about it, or endorse it by not doing anything about it.

Mass downvoting is essentially a function of the karma system, so I'm willing to bet that their inaction is more focusing their efforts elsewhere on more important and more easily combatted issues, ie removing illegal content from the feed. Brigading can be seen in just about any thread that involves someone challenging popular opinion, particularly with OP's condescending and near-offensive comments, so it's more a psychological issue. People are just more likely the downvote and move on than spend the time to write out a constructive reply.

&gt;The admins can address it more directly because they have a transparent view of post voting, and can disable votes + accounts on their end.

I agree on the first part, entirely so. The ""score hidden"" function is a good step but more structural changes need to be made for a more balanced system. However, it's highly highly naive to expect admins of a site as large as reddit to focus on disabling accounts. Given that reddits regular traffic is in the millions, do you seriously think it's reasonable for a small group to spend time and effort on disabling accounts? Especially considering the ease to which a new account can be made?",0,1383086985,null,0,1383087570,0,cd2h3ca,t3_1pbt8v,t1_cd2h3ca,t1_cd2ggrd,null,1428934898,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

As you say video is very different, those guys are still years behind the music guys. I can go on google play and buy a TV season box set for 18quid or so that I could pick up on DVD from amazon for less than a tenner. It makes no sense to use most of the overpriced online offerings. I use Netflix, but have to use a DNS hack to get US content (so therefore still pirating in theory) because the UK offering is so bad. I was having a look at Now TV from Sky earlier.

I live in a high-crime, poor area of south London. I see absolutely no purpose in owning a gun, at all.

Say I get mugged - a group of guys come up to me and tell me to give them my phone and my wallet. One of them has a knife. I am unarmed. What do I do? I give it to them, of course - why escalate a situation and endanger my life? I walk away, shaken but ok.

What if they threaten me more seriously - say, tell me to walk down into an alleyway and lie on the ground? As a 20-something girl, this is an unpleasant but plausible scenario. Well, screaming and running away would be the obvious thing to do, or I might try to defend myself with my hands. What's the worst that could happen? I might get stabbed. In one month this year, 1000 people in London were the victim of knife crime. 400 were injured, and 4 died. So, if someone produces a knife there's a 40% chance of getting injured but only a 0.4% of dying. That doesn't happen with guns.

I don't carry mace or any kind of weapon at all. If I did, it would instantly escalate any situation I found myself in from a simple robbery to a battle with use of deadly force. My chance of death or serious injury goes from tiny (here, take my stuff and go away!) to quite high (shoot at them and run away, but what if they shoot back, and maybe don't miss?). 

The alternative, which you seem suggest - I produce an assault weapon and kill all of them, before they can get me - means that maybe 7 young men are now dead, whose only crime was falling in with the wrong crowd and nicking a couple of phones for a laugh.

And in every other circumstances in which you would be allowed to carry or use a shotgun, it's the better and more appropriate firearm.

There is absolutely no case to make for using firearms for self-defence purposes in Britain, and very few people who actually want to own handguns, so there's no call for what you're suggesting and no point, and it just makes you seem like a bit of a sociopath to assert that there is, or that it's even a problem.",0,1383088853,null,0,false,0,cd2hup3,t3_1pbt8v,t1_cd2hup3,t1_cd2hmd2,null,1428934543,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Unfortunately as far as Travel Insurance goes and in my experience, your story is very, very common.  I used to run various adventure sports / expedition type trips in some of the weirder parts of the world and unfortunately it was quite common for clients to fuck them self's on a regular basis. You are not alone in being out of pocket.  

Basically the insurance company's will try and do every thing in their power to not pay up / provide repatriation when your in a vulnerable position.  3 or 4 whiskys is not drunk to the point of recklessness so unless your insurance specifically states you should have a blood alcohol level below a certain threshold, you have a case to get your money for the flight and medical bills back. 

If you fancy a fight with the insurers and a chance of getting your cash back, Start an online blog stating all the facts, copies of the receipts, medical details etc and copy's of all communication with the underwriters. Write to your MP and local press about it (they might as well do something) Put in an invoice via recorded delivery and when they ignore it, take them to the small claims court. If you can wrangle it so that you can claim compo for the trip and disfigurement .- find a no win / no fee solicitor and put in a fucking huge claim.  

I'm going to take an opportunity to rant here....The way medical travel insurance runs as a industry is both a disgrace and quite frankly immoral.  I have seen too many people over the years needlessly suffer both physical and mentally whilst relying on what they believed to be adequate cover.  It touches a nerve but 4 years ago my mother died after having a stroke in Morocco and was not repatriated quickly enough.  It took AXA insurance nearly a month to ""get the finance in place"" for a flight out by which point she was well past the point of no return. In their eyes it was worth the wait as they would not have had to pay out as much if she had died.  AXA only agreed to organise their own flight when I started faxing them quotes of my own.  Please don't feel any morality in squeezing as much out of them as you can.",0,1383089892,null,0,false,0,cd2ia6l,t3_1phdok,t1_cd2ia6l,t3_1phdok,null,1428934342,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

true,intangible-tangerine,null,null,"Guy Fawkes, as you may know, is presented in the populist version as an heroic anarchist who wanted to do away with the Monarchy. 

But this isn't actually what he wanted, his actual goal was to replace our Constitutional Protestant Monarch with an Absolute Catholic one.  (An absolute Monarch is like a dictator with a crown, their word is law) 

Catholics (and other non-Anglican groups, including non-conformist Protestants) were oppressed in Great Britain at the time, BUT they generally had a much better deal than Protestants living in Catholic countries in Europe. They did not enjoy political freedoms such as the right to stand as an MP, but they could generally live peacefully if they kept their heads down. 

Meanwhile France had experienced the Bartholomew Massacre just a generation before.

 In many ways life was better for the lower social classes in Protestant countries regardless of your religion because Great Britain and other Protestant countries such as the Netherlands had developing proto-democratic systems with checks on religious and government power, bills of rights for ordinary people and the like. 

There was far more power devolved to the Middle Class which kept a check on those at the top. Of course the poor were screwed everywhere, but even then the rule of Law and checks on powers made a difference. 

The Proto-democracies weren't perfect, but compared to Catholic countries where an absolute Monarch vied with the Vatican for political power and influence and the Middle Class had to rely on currying favour with the Court or the Church to gain influence they were what we modern types would call *progressing*

It's vital to note that at this time the power of the Vatican within the Church was much greater than it is now and there were debates about whether Catholicism was compatible with Democracy or Secular Constitutional Law, whether a Catholic State could ever be pluralistic or whether it could adapt to change. 

It seems crazy now with hindsight, but think of the debates the modern world has about whether Islam is compatible with Democracy.. 

So, when Fawkes and his associates set out to blow up the Houses of Parliament, to a patriotic British mind they were not *liberating* anyone, rather they were attempting to remove a Constitutional Monarch and replace him with a puppet of the Pope. 

This should not be confused with being anti-Catholic, the objection was NOT to the Catholic religion, it was to the attempted imposition of a non-democratic religiously based authority on a people who were used to certain Rights and who were majority Protestant.

Long answer: The Hurt Doctor has already been shown in scenes in screenshots and the Comic-Con trailer to be involved in the Time War. That's no longer conjecture at this point. So it stands to reason that he is either a missing regeneration between 8 and 9 or 8 in the latter stages of his life He has also been shown working alongside 10 and 11 which makes him being the Valeyard highly unlikely. If it was him it would have to be a Valeyard from an earlier point in time before meeting the Sixth Doctor as after ""Trial of a Time Lord"" he later met the Seventh Doctor and died during that encounter (the novel ""Matrix"" if you're interested). Ultimately the Valeyard supposedly manifests between the Doctor's 12 and final incarnations and depending on how the Hurt Doctor fits into the picture along with the supposed miscount of regenerations that Moffat has been teasing we may have either already seen the regen that created the Valeyard or it has yet to be shown.

&gt;It is a good thing that government ministers come to Scotland sometimes. It is a bad thing that they insist on opening their mouths when they do. Earlier this year we endured the spectacle of Philip Hammond making an erse of himself; today it has been Theresa May’s turn to make one wish cabinet ministers would, just occasionally, contemplate the virtue of silence.

&gt;[..]

&gt;Anyway, the point is that most of this is a non-issue and it is, or should be, unworthy of the Home Secretary to imply that Scots shouldn’t vote for independence because if they do they increase the risk they’ll be blown up by lunatic terrorists who would have been apprehended if only Scotland had been wise enough to remain part of the United Kingdom. This sort of thing, for once, really does merit the scaremongering label.

Congrats on the job offer. Firstly, Newbury is a town of 30,000, Reading is effectively a city of 200,000-300,000 people. They're both pretty much what you expect from those figures. 

Newbury is a lovely market town with some pretty nice scenery and some really pretty villages surrounding it. The big downside to it versus Reading is that there isn't much happening for (what I presume) is a young person as yourself. We have two mediocre bars and one nightclub which are only ever busy on Saturdays. We have got a cinema which livens things up a bit. There are also two really good theatres, the corn exchange and the watermill if you're into live theatre. Other than that, there's not too much happening. Most of your essentials are there though -  supermarkets, gyms, library, pubs, a small selection of shops and restaurants. Oh and if you have kids/plan on having kids, the state schools are pretty good as far as I'm aware. 

Reading on the other hand has far more things to do, I'm not as familiar with it though. The oracle is a big shopping centre and there are a fair few pubs and bars that I'm aware of. It's also got a far greater selection of the essentials I listed above. If you're into sports, they've got Reading FC and London Irish. Area I know of to avoid: Whitley. 

Transport wise, you can commute from reading to newbury in 20-30 minutes on the m4 or there's a very regular train. Newbury does occasionally have direct trains into London but usually you'd have to change at Reading. I think I'm right in saying that Reading train station is one of the biggest stations outside London and you can get anywhere in the country from there so you're pretty well connected in either Newbury or Reading. 

I imagine house/rental prices would be cheaper in Reading than Newbury but obviously you'd have to counter that with the amount you'd spend commuting. Also if you lived in Newbury I imagine you'd be able to walk to work, or cycle if that's your thing (unless your job is in the Vodafone headquarters). 

Anyway, it's late, I'm sure I could tell you more but that's all I can think of right now. Feel free to PM me any questions you have - I lived in Newbury for 19 years and come back every uni holiday so I'm pretty familiar with it. 


TLDR - Newbury is nicer and more picturesque than Reading, but Reading has more to do. ",0,1383092157,null,0,false,0,cd2j8bd,t3_1pgyn2,t1_cd2j8bd,t3_1pgyn2,null,1428933847,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

If you want to get rid of these people quickly then you can say you don't have a computer. Or just hang up. I however consider it a community service to keep them on the phone as long as possible - while I am winding them up they aren't calling some little old lady who might fall for it.

I've never got close to 1h45m. My record is about 20 minutes, after which they called me back and spoke to my partner for about 10 minutes more even as my partner explained that his job is IT security and he's not falling for their crap. They are incredibly tenacious, saying ""this is a scam and I'm just keeping you on the phone to wind you up"" doesn't actually make them hang up. My favourite one was when I wound up the bloke so much he told me to fuck off. I said ""Excuse me, did you just tell me to fuck off?"" and he responded by going back to the start of his script ""Madam, can you see the start button."" Another guy told me my English wasn't good enough to understand (I wasn't even trying to be misunderstood, I'm just Northern.)

Good tactics for keeping them on the phone unnecessarily/winding them up include:

Telling them you are starting up the computer. You can probably keep them going for 5-10 mins by saying ""gosh it is very slow starting up, you must be right.""

Describing in detail a linux setup to them (or Mac). ""Press the windows key, madam."" ""Do you mean the super key? mine has a penguin on.""

Telling them to hold the line while you get the person in charge of computers then playing 'Folsom Prison Blues' on the ukulele.

I've no doubt that Westminster needs to be massively pared back, if not done away with but don't see how that would be facilitated by our breaking away from the UK in 2014.

Back on topic, cybercrime is probably a moot point given its global nature and the fact that friendly agencies need to work together, although I don't know what would happen were we to have to recruit for our own intelligence network. I imagine that it could take a while to get up and running and can see how the cross-border dealings could potentially delay things.

I don't think that May is necessarily correct in her statement about terrorism here but it does seem to me that a major physical strike on the Borders or Dumfriesshire could also easily affect the north of England. I expect the Yes campaign to understandably spin this statement a bit but, ultimately, we live on the same wee land mass, with our countries only separated by an invisible line- the City of London feels far more separate to me than Yorkshire or Wales.

I'm disappointed though unsurprised that MacAskill chose not to answer any of May's points; it would have been great to know that the current Scottish government, at the head of the separation charge, had a plan for this situation but the lack of reply sounds once again to me like they're saying ""It'll be *fine*, we're on this, don't worry about it.""

In America it is illegal for federal money to be spent on abortions.  This means that Planned Parenthood gets federal money, they're not allowed to spend a single cent of it on abortions.  However, they can spend the money on other things which frees up other money that they do spend on abortions.

Hendo is more effective centrally, so I don't believe dropping Cissokho and slotting in Hendo as a wingback would be effective. I can probably see the same setup we had against Newcastle, where Hendo or Moses will be played centrally behind SAS and Gerrard/Lucas being used as the CMs. Coutinho will most likely be brought in as an impact sub if we're lacking creativity, but we're playing Arsenal at the Emirates and we need to use the 3-5-2 as a counterattack strategy.",0,1383102697,null,0,false,0,cd2nkgy,t3_1pebpb,t1_cd2nkgy,t3_1pebpb,null,1428931751,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

You're not so far away that you can only come down once, so I'd definitely recommend having a look to see if there's a particular event happening. Here's some websites to have a look at:

http://www.brightonlife.com/
http://whatson.brighton.co.uk/index.aspx
http://www.theargus.co.uk/leisure/events/
http://www.visitbrighton.com/whats-on

Also, for gigs, check out the usual places like http://www.songkick.com , http://www.seetickets.com etc.

If you haven't got plans for the 5th of November, [the Lewes bonfire night](http://www.lewesbonfirecelebrations.com/) will be happening soon. Lewes is a normally quite sleepy town about 15 minutes train journey out of Brighton that goes fully mental every year with a massive procession and loads of (ticketed) firework displays.

What sort of things are you into, going out/spending a day out-wise?

Having said all that, although Brighton doesn't really wind down too much over winter (especially as its only recently that there was a new influx of fresh-faced students wanting to go out all the time), it does come alive spring/summer time. So if your idea of a good day out involves catching some rays, it might be best to wait a bit. Spring/summer brings street parties, days on the beach, [Brighton Pride](http://www.brighton-pride.org/) and loads of other fun stuff.",0,1383104236,null,0,false,0,cd2o5zz,t3_1p519w,t1_cd2o5zz,t1_cd2g6bv,null,1428931472,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,sacredstones,null,null,"its narrow on paper, but hendo would go wide left to keep pressure up there.

Rodgers said that, but we really only saw it when the triangle was inverted against west brom. The rest of the games we have been the ones pressed in our own half and finding it hard to get out. Thats why I'm thinking a 4-4-2 would be effective. We have players in Hendo, Suarez, Sturridge, and Gerrard that are effective at applying a lot of pressure. Its pretty much how we played against West Brom except we ADD coutinho to apply even more pressure. Its true that having only one holding mid makes more gaps, but thats why the pressure is so essential. When you press the opposition you reduce the options for passing. its a bigger risk, but I like the fact that we have Coutinho AND henderson on the pitch and are thus are able to keep high pressure while having even more offensive players on the pitch. When pressed, the opposition will MOST LIKELY have fewer passing options, making it easier for Lucas to cut out or it will force the opponent to boot the ball into space, in which case the CB's can go wide and jockey until the fullback returns (standard practice in a back 4 formation). its definitely an aggressive formation, but i think our team could pull it off very well. 

If we end up staying with 3-5-2, I worry what will happen if Hendo is replaced with Coutinho. We lose a lot of defensive presence, which means we'll end up getting pressed back into our half again.

This is out of line there is no reason to block girlsgonewild, it doesn't have any illegal pornography on it. So why ban it?

Because of a possibility that it might be misused on occasion? All evidence points towards the fact 99 percent of pictures on girlsgonewild is made by consenting, grown up women who made the choice to put themselves up on the internet.

In Britain there is a movement by the government,some feminists and social conservatives to block pornography outright. They muddy the water by linking pornography to illegal pornography unjustly and try to make out that all pornography is illegal.

Just this picture from newsnight shows how biased the media is towards the government in pushing its propaganda.

The IWF although i don't agree with them do a good job in blocking child and other illegal pornography.

But girlsgonewild is in no way centered on illegal pornography, so why is it being blocked for me and lots of other internet users?

The union carried out a ballot for strike action, and in retaliation the company shut the entire plant down, then came out saying that the place was running out of money and unless workers signed up to a reduction in pay, pensions and other terms and conditions that the entire plant would close forever, loosing 800 jobs in the process.

Effectively, the company was willing to turn one situation into another.  THe union is there to protect jobs, so they consulted the workers again, and the workers on site said that they'd rather keep their jobs, instead of persuing it any further.  

Remember, this isn't 'Len Mclusky's own position' - this was worker created and backed action.  When its working properly, the union should do what its members want - which is what happened here.

No because I have no figures. Whether it's done efficiently or not is not the same as it costing less to administer than the total amount paid in the actual benefit itself.

&gt;And I take it that this is means tested? 

If you are referring to the cold weather payment then no its not. You get it dependent on what other benefit you get, as opposed to whether you have too much income or savings. It is automatically paid to those that are entitled.

true,Jamaicaman90,swans1995,1912,"&gt;The word ""yes"" alone takes a while to explain I'm sure.

Solution: Don't teach it.

Seriously. They teach you essentially as if they are a talking phrase book. You won't learn even the most basic grammar and sentence construction unless you get to A-Level. Until then, you're stuck with 'Mae hi'n [weather]' and 'Dw'in byw yn [place]' level of Welsh from the age of 7 to 16. It's borderline demeaning how simple they teach it, and the amount of times I heard 'don't worry about *why*' when asking about a rule ('yes and no' being a perfect example) was ridiculous.

Maybe you couldn't teach it *exactly* like French and Spanish, but as someone who got fairly proficient at both during my time at school and then pushed on afterwards, it would have been far, far better than the way Welsh was taught. Even learning what the basic verbs were and how to use them would have been nice, rather than relying on having an example sentence for literally every sentence I'd ever get the chance to use.

So yeah, that's it basically. Welsh language education in English-medium schools consists of being given a list of nouns (proper or otherwise), and being given a sentence with a gap in it where you put in the noun that applies to you. Now try and remember that sentence word for word and that's you ready for assessment. Don't understand what any of the individual words in it mean? Don't know what 'Pa fath' means? *Don't worry about it*.

You can see the resentment seeping in already, can't you? Like your friends, I regret learning Welsh. But, I also know that trying harder in school would have got me nowhere anyway, because they don't give you the tools to use it, they just rig you up to pass the specific tests they give you.",0,1383119516,null,0,false,0,cd2s9e3,t3_1pgh1j,t1_cd2s9e3,t1_cd2gno9,null,1428928563,1,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,1

After his opening bullshit, I told him in no uncertain terms just how big a cunt I thought he was and hung up, he instantly phoned back just to get into a 15 minute argument.

A few choice gems included:

* Me constantly asking him if his mother was proud of him, and then referring to her as a rotten bag of dicks (this **really** pissed him off, I think it might be a cultural thing thats taken even worse over there than it is other places)

* Him telling me that I actually don't work in IT and have no idea what I'm talking about. (I'm a self-employed IT tech, I fix the aftermath of this kind of shit about once a month!)

* Him repeatedly asking me really basic IT questions in an attempt to prove who has the biggest tech-penis (such as: ""what is the registry??! you can't tell me what the registry can you sir?!!!""), mostly followed by me laughing.

* Copious amounts of me berating his mother with the foulest language I could think of... I did kinda lose my cool a little I have to admit.

* Me asking him if he really thinks that Microsoft employees actually talk to customers like that, followed by him calling me an idiot.

* This exchange:

me: I know what your going to say, your gonna get me to open event viewer and tell me that all the stuff in the logs are viruses or some shit.

him: Hahahaha no sir you don't know what your talking about, where did you hear that? who told you that?

me: not event viewer then?

him: no sir, blah blah blah...

me: you're going to tell me to run NETSTAT and then tell me all the ""Foreign Addresses"" are people hacking my computer?

Him: &lt;long pause&gt; ""no....."" &lt;pause&gt; &lt;massive rant about how I should respect him for trying to help me&gt;

* At the end I decided since wasting his time was time he couldn't spend trying to scam someone else I VERY sarcastically went along with him and agreed to follow his instructions just to see what he would do, and started to boot up my Windows XP VM (Virtual Machine, where he could do whatever the fuck he wanted without causing any harm)

Unfortunately I basically told him that I was going to log his IP address, and he instantly hung up before the VM had even booted. I had no idea what I was going to do with it once I got it, but it makes me wonder if Indian/wherever ISP's are actually aware and reactive to this sort of thing if they receive a report. Either that or he thought I was a l33t hacker or something for knowing what TCPview is. Heh, I wish, these people and especially this guy in particular are massive cunts, if I knew of a good way of fucking them up remotely I'd get it ready for next time.

Bale didn't do much in the first half of the season, but scored the bulk of his goals in the 2nd half of the season. I still don't see your point.

All the hype surrounding Bale last season started after those long range goals. He scored a few good goals, but so did Mata and Van Persie (I like how you skipped over those points). He was NOT the best player in the league, and was average on both occasions when Spurs faced us or UTD. He was one of the best players in the league, yes, but so was Anelka when he got the golden boot. That golden boot didn't go towards much, though.

It was his long range goals that kept Spurs in the race for 4th place. But the thing with long-range goals is that they don't always last. He had that one good performance vs West Ham... But come on.. Its West Ham. I'm not going to judge a player as one of the best in the world if he scores a few good goals vs a side like West Ham.

Yes, he shouldn't be there. He is not one of the best players in the world. Compare his season to Messi's or Ronaldo's and you'll notice the gulf in quality.

I agree wholeheartedly.  There are definitely some reasons to be optimistic, but this issue has been long-standing.  It's not just happened this season.  Last year we only won two games (TWO!!!) by more than one goal, which is dreadful for a team aspiring for a top four result.

AVB has a pretty one-dimensional attacking tactic (hope for a pacy winger to make a run and dink it into the box, or take shots from range).  It makes us predictable and very easy to shut down unless someone like Bale or Townsend scores a wonder goal.  Compare that to the modern formula of fast, skilful, highly mobile CAMs doing lots of off the ball movement (Mata, Silva, Cazorla, Ozil, Hazard, etc), and we look downright old fashioned.

I'm thankful for the points we've got, but we're not going to go where we want to this season unless we bang more goals in.  If our opponents are regularly trumping minnows 3-1 and 4-0, us scraping by on 1-0 results will come back to bite us big time at some point.  Our defence is looking good, but it's easy to get a single unlucky goal, referee decision or piece of brilliance go against you.  When we shape up against teams containing the likes of Aguero and RVP, do we really think one goal might be enough to beat them?
