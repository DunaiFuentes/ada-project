i think it would be more interesting with Eriksen/Holtby (depending on opponent, health, style of game etc) and Siggy both in advanced CAM roles with Sandro sitting deep.

A midfield like:

------Eriksen-------Siggy-------

------------Sandro-------------

With Lamela/Lennon/Andros/Chadli outside and Soldado ahead may be useful in some situations (lower table teams or when chasing a game).

Would allow us to get Siggy's scoring threat on the pitch while not forcing him to be the creator and not lose Eriksen's creativity.

You need to look at the current inflation rate, standard interest rate etc to make a calculated decision. There are many theories about greater chances if you take it all , and then buy new bonds.

If I were in your shoes I would take the money and then put it in to a P2P system like Zopa or Rate setter, you would get ~5%. Or if you want to move a long the risk/ratio line use Funding Circle and get between 8% and 12%.

Zopa is probably the simplest.

Well, somewhat. He can only vaguely recall it since he crossed with hisbowb timeline in that encounter.

&gt;Why will he be afraid of going to Trenzalore?

Because no one ever said Capaldi was his final regeneration, the one he dies as.

&gt;Why will his regeneration limit come up if he Obie's he's going to become 4 again?  

Well, that whole 13 limit was never actually claimed as fact. It was mentioned, briefly, in only a few episodes in the 70s. But if you want to use that limit, the show does say it's possible to obtain more regeneration energy, leading to more than 13 regenerations, easily.

&gt;It's a cameo. Show me a source where anyone from the show says othewise. 

How about the dialogue where The Curator says ""We may find ourselves revisiting a few old favorites."" ? There are a few areas where The Curator refers to himself or the doctor as 'we'.

&gt;He never said he was the future doctor, so it's not cannon. 

The lines The Curator delivers about Gallifrey being lost mean absolutely nothing? And does Smith or Capaldi have to blatantly say ""I saved Gallifrey instead of destroying it and locked in a separate dimension!"" In order for the 50th to be cannon?

One issue with it that I rarely see discussed is the problems it causes us offensively.

No, only the younger doctors weren't going to remember, it was never established that 11, the oldest, wouldn't remember.  If he didn't remember, then the whole conversation is moot anyways.

&gt;Because no one ever said Capaldi was his final regeneration, the one he dies as.

The thirteen limits is real, it has been established.  It was even established in the 50th, when a time lord says ""All thirteen doctors.""  Meaning they limit still exists. 

&gt; Well, that whole 13 limit was never actually claimed as fact.

Moffat has said repeatedly that it's fact, and that that's the plot of the Christmas special.

&gt;The lines The Curator delivers about Gallifrey being lost mean absolutely nothing?

&gt;How about the dialogue where The Curator says ""We may find ourselves revisiting a few old favorites."" ? There are a few areas where The Curator refers to himself or the doctor as 'we'.

Doesn't mean he's the Doctor.  He could be the moment, he could be something from the Tardis, he could be a Time Lord that looks similar to 4, and was old friends with the Doctor.  There are many other things he could be other than the Doctor.

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"Sounds like my brother's situation. He worked as a barman for six month before the landlord leased a second pub, putting my brother in as manager. The landlord interfered constantly, paid my brother a salary which amounted to £2.91 an hour because he worked 80 hours a week, promised a Christmas bonus to make up for this which ended up being £100, constantly criticised my brother, even though he was doing really well and the pub was popular.

One time on his day off, my brother and my mum and I went for a hike up a nearby hill, and my brother put his phone on airplane mode half an hour after we started following a barrage of texts from the landlord about how it was my brother's ""evening"" off, not day off, and he couldn't afford to pay the barman covering my brother.

Meanwhile, the landlord's stepson was constantly hanging around the place and regulars reported him going behind the bar and taking cash out of the till while my brother wasn't at the bar, changing barrels in the basement or whatever. The landlord occasionally brought up that there was money missing from the till, but when my brother relayed this information he was accused of lying.

Then came the final straw. My brother at the time, along with one of the barmen, was living above the landlord's other pub as a security measure, while the landlord lived above the one my brother ran as it had much larger living quarters. One time the landlord reported that there was a bottle of whiskey missing from behind the bar at the pub he himself ran, and when my brother and his barman got home after their shift could they look for it around the living area. So my brother and his friend were like, fine, we're not going to bed til we find it. Funny thing, it was in the lounge. Not even hidden, just in the lounge. The landlord and his wife said they'd looked in there and it hadn't been there when they looked, basically accusing my brother and his friend of lying.

So my brother quit, and so did his barman friend. And in fact so did one of the other bar staff (leaving only one left, who'd only just started and was not trained in all aspects of the pub stuff like changing barrels and cleaning lines). The landlord put in the thieving stepson as manager. All the bands performing on Friday nights that my brother had booked cancelled. The pub instantly started making a loss where before it was making a profit, and the landlord ditched it, focusing on the first pub (which has an income based on tourists, not locals).

The pub has been run by several different landlords since then, none having it more than 6 months (one seemed like he was doing well, but his son was left running his other pub and was doing it badly, so he had to go back) and this year the brewery that owned it finally gave up on it and sold it.

**TL;DR: cuntish landlord bullied and underpaid my brother, who was good at his job, until my brother quit. Landlord put his thieving, scrounger of a stepson in as manager, business folded within two months.**",0,1387223295,null,0,false,0,ce387j7,t3_1szz4n,t1_ce387j7,t1_ce35ev7,null,1428106541,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

Both should be forced to pay their interns, they do work which newspapers once paid a wage to staff to do. What's worse, the New Statesman doesn't even recognise the National Union of Journalists, it's an anti-union workplace which isn't surprising given who runs it. Helen Lewis, the New Statesman editor, condemned Unite's tactics at Grangemouth at a time when Ineos was holding the country to ransom and threatening the livelihoods of the workers there. Fuck hypocritical liberals, they always side with the bosses when it comes down to it.

Failure at the Club has been punished swiftly and severely on every occasion.  The remit is not to build a Club that gets to the Knockout Stages, it's to build *the biggest Club in the world*.  I think people should think about what entails for a minute.

It's a tough one that because it's hard to compare a 6 month team to a few year team due to changes in form and the like.  It's also tough because it's unfair on Pellegrini; I've never seen Pellegrini face this type of challenge before at City so don't have any leaning to how he'll react.

Mancini's City were defensively superior and crucially, they packed the middle of the park with players to allow a slower tempoed game of possession.

Pellegrini's City play much more open and thus carry a far greater attacking threat.

If I could mix and match I'd take Mancini away and Pellegrini at home, and this would be perfect.  Over the two legs though, despite the lack of players in the middle I'd go with Pellegrini because his play in wider areas is superior (and I feel this is somewhere where we could punish Barca) and the combination of Yaya and Fernandinho could both excel as a high workrate physical midfield two (or three if he also put Milner in there) which worries Barca.  

Mancini would be based around keeping the ball for long periods yet I still feel today that many of our players lack composure when they are being pressed, and this would gift possession back to Barca and undo his game plan.",0,1387224226,null,0,false,0,ce38ne2,t3_1t01cj,t1_ce38ne2,t1_ce38auq,null,1428106336,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3

That ""Factcheck"" seems to be wildly optimistic.

Or maybe you're being pessimistic. It's all relative.

&gt;The study also neglects the possibility of Turkey joining the European Union, which would give some 70 million Turks the opportunity to move into Europe, most of them being Muslim. Turkey has the youngest population in Europe.

70 million is practically the _entire population_ of Turkey. They won't _all_ leave and move into Europe (just like sixty million UK citizens haven't left and gone to the US). Those who do migrate will mostly go to Germany because that is the European country with the highest immigration and the largest Turkish population.

&gt;I do not have time to analyse the data in the fertility decline study, but these numbers are staggering regardless. A question we need to ask is what percentage of the Muslim population resides in the rest of the UK rather than England? We keep speaking about Britain or the UK, but the truth is it's England that is really in trouble with these demographic figures.

Not even all England. Mostly London and Birmingham, if anywhere.

&gt;Demographic changes are very difficult to estimate but one thing is certain, the Islamic community is going to grow substantially while at the same time moving increasingly in a different direction to the rest of British society.

Nah. With each generation they'll be more like us. The birth rate will tend to align with the national average. It usually does.

&gt;The idea that large swathes of people who live among other Muslims, visit the Mosque with other Muslims, pray five times per-day with other Muslims, celebrate certain religious festivals with other Muslims and largely socialise with other Muslims will all of a sudden decide to become secular atheists is extremely wishful thinking.

No-one expects that. You're throwing up quite a straw man there.

&gt; Apostasy in Islam basically results in complete social ostracisation. When you take into account ""*White Flight*"", the opportunity for young Muslims to socialise and learn among their non-Muslim counterparts will diminish.

So we fight against it, by welcoming Muslims instead of ostracising them ourselves. Meet a few. Introduce yourself. Say hello. Salaam. Whatever. If we allow them to integrate,  the Islamic social death associated with apostasy loses its impact.

&gt;This is where the real problem exists. How do you introduce and ""integrate"" people into a way of life that becomes not only alien to them, but the very polar opposite of what they believe in.

Gently, and with a friendly disposition. See above.

&gt; Christianity started to decay through a slow evolution of changing attitudes. It will be harder for Islam to go through a similar change as accepting this course of action will be viewed through the prism of abandoning ones faith/culture/people.

It will happen, slowly. It helps if we start treating them like human beings instead of aliens. The more we despise and exclude them, the more they'll turn inward.

&gt;The danger presents itself through the growing consolidation of power by the Islamic community. As they grow in number, the main three political parties will have to outcompete one another to gain their support. This will result in Muslim political candidates being selected to contest seats in predominantly Muslim areas. This will exacerbate and  intensify the segregation in towns and cities across England. I believe that will possibly be the beginning of an attempt at securing local political autonomy based on religion.

There are already Muslim councillors and MPs, mostly from the major parties and fairly well integrated, essentially British. As long as the major parties continue to allow well-adjusted Muslims to get somewhere in mainstream UK politics instead of shutting them out, there will be no need for isolationist representatives and the scenario you describe simply will not happen.

&gt;The reality of the dilemna is inextricably depressing.

Relax. By the time all that happens, you'll be dead.

I'm not too sure about how Cahill's feeling, and I'd like Terry to be rested ahead of Arsenal so they'll be some changes at CB. In midfield I'm not too sure what will happen, though I'm going to use our LC game against Arsenal for some inspiration. Mikel and Essien played well together then and controlled the tempo of the game. Furthermore, they'll both be able to help on our troublesome setpieces. Further forward it's about rotation and keeping everyone fresh, again with the Arsenal game in mind. 

4-3-3

Schwarzer

Azpi-Omeruo/Kalas-Luiz/Cahill-Cole

Mikel-Essien

Oscar

Mata/De Bruyne Ba Schuerrle/Hazard

I left some flexibility in there, could easily be a 4-2-3-1, and there's some leeway with specific players. I'd love to see Hazard tear them apart again, but I'm not sure if he need's a quick rest before the upcoming fixtures (following his most recent performance).

 Just note that it's still about winning; this side or a similar one should have more than enough quality to beat Sunderland again.

It was like every time Lord is born with a set amount, and depending on how they used it, it could only last them oh so long, but on average they can only kind of stretch it between 12 or 13, or at least that was average. So I was just kind of thinking that River has used hers for a lot of things other than full regenerations: she changed her dress size, she let out little bursts, she could have used it for anything.

One of my most vivid footballing memories is my brother and I groaning in pain when Riquelme missed *that* penalty against Arsenal in 2006.

Couple of things I wanted to touch upon.

Pellegrini's Villarreal had a phenomenal record against Barca. This [game in 2005](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIVm9gwgtXA) when Forlan denied Eto'o the golden boot sticks out as one of the best from a neutral point of view. So on the closed game vs. open game issue, I think Pellegrini should stick to what has been shown to work for him, which is an open free-flowing game. A lot of people think playing a closed compact game is the best strategy against Barca, but this is really a case of confirmation bias. Nobody remembers all the teams that come to the camp nou to put 9 men behind the ball and end up on the losing side but the few that succeed - only Chelsea and Inter really - are remembered.

Other than that, I think it's going to really depend on how well the front 5/6 players press for each team. If Barca are allowed to play out of the back, they'll be dangerous. And if City can launch long balls over the top to Negredo, Navas, and Navas they will create chances. The front 6 for both teams have a lot of goal scoring ability and I'm confident Pellegrini won't set out to spoil the game, so we'll have a great game of football for sure.",0,1387226577,null,0,false,0,ce39r36,t3_1t01cj,t1_ce39r36,t3_1t01cj,null,1428105821,7,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,7

true,count_toastcula,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;Have you looked at FAR, SAR, TAR and AR4?
Those projections AND OBSERVATIONS keep going down. Every 5 years.

The predictions have always ranged widely, simply because it there are so many variables. The argument is not that we should stop global warming to avoid exactly 3.47C  of warming by May 2043, the argument is that we cannot risk between anywhere in the 2-4C window because the polar ice caps will probably not recover and we won't be able to return. 

If you think *this* prediction is changing, prove it.

&gt;When have we seen similar changes that could offset the results of environmental engineering? There's been millennial cycles where the planet has warmed up, and we still simply don't know enough about hot spots.

Exactly - the earth has never threatened to warm this much, this quickly. There is nothing from history to suggest that the speed of climate change we're seeing has ever happened before, discounting meteorites.

&gt;What you have to look at is how much we hope the use of green energy is going to achieve and what difference it will make. Because Germany just looked at what over €100bn invested had bought them and it had offset global climate change by an estimated 37 hours!

Where are these numbers from?

I found [this thread](http://boards.fool.co.uk/selling-beer-slops-11073596.aspx?sort=whole) with the following response from Trading Standards:

&gt;I have received your message regarding the practice of using the
overspill beer to compliment the following delivery. 

&gt;it is not specifically an offence to do this but from a mixture of
Trading Standards, Food Standards and Environmental rules it would be a
practice that would be advised against, as possibilities of certain
breaches of legislation could occur in certain circumstances, eg whether
the quality could be compromised if the spill is stale or possible
hygiene contraventions.

&gt;it is probably indicative of a failure to control the level of froth on
the beer and is likely being done to minimise his ullage wastage. 

&gt;We make regular visits to public houses but this is not a practice we
would observe on our routine checks as it would not be done in our
presence.

Sturridge is such a creator and goal scorer that Brendan definitely needs to find a working system with both him and suarez on the field. A fluid front three, (sturridge, suarez, coutinho) is probably the best formation and it has worked before. A serious run of all three fully fit is an exciting prospect.

Agger is the type of player we WILL keep on the bench if he is not playing as well as Skrtel and Sakho. 

I have nicknamed Jose Enrique ""The Man"" because he cannot get over how damned awesome he is. He cannot seem to stay back and frequently makes runs forward and loses the ball. He thinks he is a winger and needs to be more conservative. Flanno is too young to be consistent at the position however, so steady rotation between the two would work.

What we need from the January window is a player that will improve the team, and if December goes well, fuel a title push. Liverpool needs more quality depth in the midfield and front line, as well as for right back (Kelly might fix that). 
With great power comes great responsibility and that responsibility is Brendan Rodger's. He needs to give new players time on the pitch. period. they cannot prove themselves or improve and the starters need rest.

&gt;Exactly - the earth has never threatened to warm this much, this quickly.

Except the changes seem to coincide with the Medieval Warm Period and the Roman Warm Period.  So we might add a little with human intervention, and then maybe a little less back if we remortgage the entire proverbial farm to spend on renewables, shaving maybe a degree off...only to then go into another warm period which cancels out our endeavour.

&gt;Where are these numbers from?

Bjørn Lomborg of the Copenhagen Consensus and formerly the Danish Environmental Assessment Institute.  It was actually over $100bn ($110bn) - I remembered wrong currency but the point stands.  Remembered the hours right.  For everything a country like Germany has done, which is still billions with an ongoing commitment, globally they've pushed the problem back by the end of the century by 37 hours.  At 38 hours all the cuts and reductions they have introduced would have been replaced.

As far as 'worst option' and Pinochet goes, Videla and Pinochet were drawn from the same far-right neoliberal ideology though I have no idea where you get the idea that Videla was 'better' than Pinochet. They were pretty similar, though the repression in Chile during Pinochet's rule is worse.

Here an account from a prisoner in Chile under Pinochet:

“Once at the prison camp, agents questioned Ayress for hours to gain information about liberal intelligence. She refused to answer and suffered immense torture. Ayress’s torture began with nude beatings. Agents yelled insults at her while they beat her. They screamed, “Speak, red dog, or we will shoot your father and brother in front of you!” Each day her torture worsened. Agents sliced her skin and burnt her with cigarettes. Then they hung her from the ceiling and crammed tree limbs and coke bottles into her vagina and anus. As the days passed Ayress endured more gruesome treatment. Tortures stripped her naked and placed her on metal bedsprings where they shocked her tongue and vagina. Guards employed animals to conduct torture on Ayress and forced her to endure rape by Dobermans. They also shoved starved rats into her vagina. She screamed as the rats ripped and tore their way out. Guards raped Ayress over 40 times and consequently she became pregnant. She feared that if her tortures learned of her pregnancy she would face maniacal experimentation on her foetus. She kept quiet about her pregnancy but as a result of endless torture miscarried.”
Source: Elizabeth Simmons ‘Torture Under Pinochet’s Regime’ Paper Given to the University of Alabama, Huntsville 2009
“For women, it was an especially violent experience. The commission reports that nearly every female prisoner was the victim of repeated rape. The perpetration of this crime took many forms, from military men raping women themselves to the use of foreign objects on victims. Numerous women (and men) report spiders or live rats being implanted into their orifices. One woman wrote, “I was raped and sexually assaulted with trained dogs and with live rats. They forced me to have sex with my father and brother who were also detained. I also had to listen to my father and brother being tortured.”

Yes, for now, probably due to the hole we made in the ozone layer. But the water under that sea ice is warming. Care to wager our future on the sea ice continuing to increase as the earth warms even further?

&gt;Except the changes seems to fit in line and coincide with the Medieval Warm Period and the Roman Warm Period. So we might add a little with human intervention, or take a little away if we remortgage the entire proverbial farm to spend on renewables, and shave maybe a degree off...and then we go into another warm period.

&gt; The taurine and zebuine cattle breeds comprise the majority of the world cattle population but their taxonomic status is still controversial. The two forms of cattle are currently classified as Bos taurus and Bos indicus species and are differentiated primarily by the presence or absence of a hump. However, these two species hybridize readily, producing fully fertile offspring. We have determined and analyzed complete B. taurus and B. indicus mitochondrial genome sequences to investigate the extent of sequence divergences and to study their taxonomic status by molecular dating. The sequences encompassed 16,338 and 16,339 nucleotides, respectively, and differed at 237 positions. Estimated divergence times indicated that the two cattle lineages separated 1.7–2.0 million years ago. Combined phylogenetic analyses of 18 new and 130 previously reported extant B. taurus and B. indicus control region sequences with data from 32 archaeological specimens of the extinct wild aurochs (Bos primigenius) identified four major maternal lineages. B. primigenius haplotypes were present in all but the B. indicus lineage, and one B. taurus sequence clustered with B. primigenius P haplotypes that were not previously linked with domestic cattle. The B. indicus cluster and a recently reported new B. primigenius haplotype that represents a new lineage were approximately equidistant from the B. taurus cluster. These data suggest domestications from several differentiated populations of B. primigenius and a subspecies status for taurine (B. primigenius taurus) and zebuine (B. primigenius indicus) cattle.

Abstract

&gt; The origin and taxonomic status of domesticated cattle are controversial. Zebu and taurine breeds are differentiated primarily by the presence or absence of a hump and have been recognized as separate species (Bos indicus and Bos taurus). However, the most widely held view is that both types of cattle derive from a single domestication event 8000-10,000 years ago. We have examined mtDNA sequences from representatives of six European (taurine) breeds, three Indian (zebu) breeds, and four African (three zebu, one taurine) breeds. Similar levels of average sequence divergence were observed among animals within each of the major continental groups: 0.41% (European), 0.38% (African), and 0.42% (Indian). However, the sequences fell into two very distinct geographic lineages that do not correspond with the taurine-zebu dichotomy: all European and African breeds are in one lineage, and all Indian breeds are in the other. There was little indication of breed clustering within either lineage. Application of a molecular clock suggests that the two major mtDNA clades diverged at least 200,000, and possibly as much as 1 million, years ago. This relatively large divergence is interpreted most simply as evidence for two separate domestication events, presumably of different subspecies of the aurochs, Bos primigenius. The clustering of all African zebu mtDNA sequences within the taurine lineage is attributed to ancestral crossbreeding with the earlier B. taurus inhabitants of the continent.

Not really because you're missing the point.

What we are doing, for however many billions we're spending, it isn't working.  No point wagering on it because what we're doing isn't changing anything meaningful.

&gt;Those were localised. The warming we're seeing now is predicted to be global (barring localised anomalies such as a shift in the gulf stream), and not temporary either.

No, the climate change is predicted to be global.

Just as climate change has always been global.

Immediately scientists are now predicting a period of global cooling:  

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/10294082/Global-warming-No-actually-were-cooling-claim-scientists.html

&gt;That guy isn't a climate scientist,

But the people he was working with very much are.  He's a political scientist that teaches statistics.  All the figure does is take the statistical reduction which the environmental scientists give him and factors that into global predictions for emissions.  

He's not arguing there that manmade global warming does or does not exist.  He's taking what emission reductions the Germans claim to have achieved, combined with what they have spent, and seeing how that impacts on global emissions over time.  Not what the emissions will actually do to the climate.

Again, you're kinda missing the point.  Accept by all means that emissions are bad and the extent of their harm, but the point remains you're not actually cutting emissions globally in a meaningful way.

You have a really polite tone.  If you feel I deserve to be insulted based on my posts above, then my apologies.  But seriously, no need to be rude about it.

A quick summary of the fulcrum of Ho Chi Minh's rise to power, he was Chief of Police of Hanoi, as the Japanese surrendered and withdraw, the Brits (who couldn't give two shits about the French colony) were meant to be managing the French return, they allowed a power vacuum to form.  During the Japanese occupation, the Annamites who had been used by the French to run things (the french simply speaking, bribed those who had the power when they arrived, took their children to be educated in Paris, very effective way of getting loyalty, as this also lined up their children to be the natural ruling administrators) were imprisoned.  Pretty much all of them died during the power vacuum.

This resulted with no one having a legitimate claim to power in the eyes of most of the locals.  I mention Ho Chi Minh because he was definitely brutal.  It was a very awful war.

I say give him more time to get it right.  Things have to turn around soon though.  If the transfer window ""isn't the answer"" like he says then he better find the answer, and soon.

The four best attacking sides in the league - Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Man City - all play multiple creative players in midfield, and allow them to drift and interchange positions fairly freely.  This is what we need to attempt.

However, your formation still plays two inverted wingers, which have caused us problems this season.  We're better off playing with true wingers (Lennon on the right, and Lamela/Townsend on the left), because it will help us stretch play and open up space in the centre of the park.  It will also massively help Soldado if we have fast wingers running to the byline to whip in crosses that come to him in front of his body, instead of having inverted wingers cut inside and cross balls in from behind him, where he doesn't have the strength or size to connect with them.

Additionally, a big problem for us has been distribution out from the back.  The ball gets bogged down in our midfield, with Dembele, Paulinho and Sandro not being particularly good or speedy distributors of the ball.  I reckon playing Holtby as a deep-lying passer (akin to Pirlo or Xabi Alonso even though he's not nearly in that class) would help get more passes forward, and quicker.  Holtby can be a very positive player, plus he has the energy to hassle and harry opposition attackers, even if he's not quite got the defensive discipline yet.",0,1387234647,null,0,false,0,ce3dk1g,t3_1t0v18,t1_ce3dk1g,t3_1t0v18,null,1428103967,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,StargazyPi,eu,European Union,"2) Ideally (and it's probably not practical at the moment, but give it a few years) - someone would build a massively complex computer simulation of the world and UK. You'd then feed into it a set of policies, then see what the projected outcome is for all aspects of society. If it's the desired one, then try the idea out!

Failing fast is also important. Politicians should be free to change their minds and back up when it becomes clear an idea isn't working. Some ideas you need to try out, and there should be no penalty. Accusations of ""flip flopping"" drive me up the wall. What, so when that idea didn't work out, you think it would be *smarter* for them to back it all the way into the ground? 

3) Proportional Representation (Alternative vote would do). First past the post is a truly terrible system. Democracy as a whole seems to work out. We at least get a new set of interchangeable incompetents every few years, after the old ones have outstayed their welcome.

4) I'd love it if more politicians were qualified in their areas of expertise. A PhD in economics would be great for a Chancellor, for example. Someone with teaching experience being Head of Education, a Science minister having at least a science degree, for example. It astounds me that almost everyone in politics is qualified for making good arguments, as opposed to delivering good products.

5) Hells yes. We've currently got the ""Let's-ignore-all-current-economic-theory-and-strip-the-country-bare"" Conservatives, wishy-washy bandwaggon jumpers Labour, Lib Dems (who were awesome until they showed their true colours), a collection of thinly-veiled-racism parties, the Greens who at least have integrity, but also no plan for the UK without giving us power outages. Give us something!

6) Not an economist, but it's clear some things need changing. I suspect tax law should be updated to the 21st century, and things like ""showing an internet advert to someone geographically located in britain"" should cause money to end up in the treasury somehow. It seems like there are a lot of holes that need patching, and a lot of simplification to be done.

7) Mainly. It's a bit unnerving to be honest. I've floated along making very few decisions until now. Suddenly, I have to pay bills, I have time to go visit people at weekends, I've got a career where my success is directly proportional to the amount of effort I put in.

For instance, because the paper points out pervasive issues of race and class-based inequality, it should artificially promote people from ethnic minorities, or from poor backgrounds? These ideas do not follow from one another. The problems are pervasive throughout society, and throughout a person's life. For instance, poverty affects child nutrition, and the amount of time parents can spend with their children, and the amount that a child is communicated with in their first two years affects their language skills for the rest of their lives; the child then goes to a shitty school, with parents who are constantly stressed out, lives in cramped conditions leading to poor health, gets a handful of qualifications, can't get into university, struggles to find a job and on and on. Is the Guardian then going to sweep in, and make everything better?

The Guardian should take reasonable steps, for instance strictly avoiding nepotism, paying for internships, appointed through formal processes, given on a meritocratic and fair basis. But it is meaningless to expect one organization to solve all these problems at a stroke, and operate within its own internal utopia.

true,northerncal,lfc68,,"Article is nice to see, but I feel like they don't totally get the whole picture with Rodgers and Henderson. Yes, he looked into selling him at first, (and got close to swapping him for Dempsey, imagine if that had gone off..) but one of Rodgers strengths is developing young talent and Henderson certainly wasn't unknown for potential, we paid 20 million for him! (too much admittedly, but hey if he keeps this form up long enough it will be worth it in the end.) 

The problem was Henderson hadn't really produced much, he had the potential but it wasn't really developing and he had plenty of poor matches. What Rodgers did was challenge Henderson to prove he had what it takes to step up to Liverpool's level. If he had shown he was not capable of doing this, Rodgers would have likely looked to move him on, but the point is I think Brendan was very fair and open minded, so he was willing to keep Hendo around if he could meet the challenge. And so far he has, which is great for everyone involved. 

TL;DR: Rodgers didn't say ""I think you suck, I want to get rid of you,"" he said ""I want players at this club who have what it takes to make it big and take this team up the table. If you can demonstrate that you can do this, you're here, but if you can't meet expectations, you'll move on.""

The way we're set up, and the high back line and disjointed midfield, means that too often we can't pass out from the back.  Lloris nearly always favours throwing the ball to one of our backs rather than kicking long, and with Walker and whoever's playing at LB pushed high up the pitch, it often leaves out two CBs stranded with the ball.  One of our CDMs must drop to provide a passing option, but savvy teams (Man City, Liverpool, and Chelsea in the 2nd half against us all did this) use fast midfield runners to suddenly press us and can easily overwhelm us before we can get the ball out of defensive zones.  Couple this with a lack of height and strength up front, and we can't hit long balls and hope to retain possession.

true,TheMasque,null,null,"I disagree frankly. I can't think of any mainstream Politcian who genuinely uses Political science. They ignore all the things that we learn about in University, quantitative research, case studies etc. 

The basic tenants of most Political science go entirely against what we often practice, and it's obvious to me (and anyone into political science) that David Cameron, Theresa May, and even Blair and most of New Labour, are all in the pockets of big business and are suffering from serious moral imperative syndrome.

If they were using political science, evidence and consensus based policies, we'd be a lot more like the Nordic and Scandanavian countries giving people a basic living income, having a more rehabilitative prison service etc  etc. We don't have that, because of the uptight Eton boys who grossly misinterpret a once reputable science to fit into their private-school aristocratic notion of reality.

Most politicians have a degree in Economics, turning it into a business, making them market politicians.


I'd remember the little people. I worked in McDonalds for 4 years going through uni. I am not proud, or uptight at all.



Edit for clarity: The moral imperatives of which I speak are things like ""People have to work to make money"", or ""Criminals deserve punishment"". Arguably true to most of the population, but in terms of science they don't actually yield the best results in tackling poverty and making the world a happy, fairer place. Universal basic income, rehabilitative treatment, mental-health, the decriminlization of drugs....this is what Political science tells us quite plainly to do.",0,1387237870,null,0,1387292708,0,ce3ey9p,t3_1t13at,t1_ce3ey9p,t1_ce3emvj,null,1428103316,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,almodozo,null,null,"&gt; of course, employers can be nice people. Just that the not-so-nice employers are usually the ones who run the tightest ships, make the most money, and run the more successful businesses

What do you base this on, if I may ask? I mean, I can't think of a way to fact-check whether nice bosses or not-so-nice bosses do better, really, which is part of why I ask. 

Anecdotal evidence can easily be found, of course, but it can easily be found for the opposite too. Trump is an ass, and yet got very rich. Google was, at least in the past, said to be a rather social-minded employer, and hasn't exactly done badly. Amazon is notorious for treating its employees like shit, and has gone big; Ford became the country's automobile powerhouse for decades by, from what I understand, taking a more family-like approach to employment, rewarding loyalty and paying employees decently (""Ford's policy proved .. that paying people more would enable Ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the economy. [Henry] Ford explained the policy as profit-sharing rather than wages"", says Wikipedia.)

Those are all superficial impressions, though. I guess you could take a more abstract approach, and base the argument on a concept of how things would or should work. Eg, you say: not being kind to your employees allows you to run a tighter ship, since you can do away with niceties, and make more money. But an equally plausible theory could be that treating your employees well will make them more willing to voluntarily work hard and scrupulously for you. Far as I know, making workers work hard out of fear or through force have proven not to work as well as fostering a sense of identification with, and loyalty to, the company (which is where all the corporate team-building, ""employee of the month"" etc stuff comes from). 

Earlier this year I read a book about labour in the Pacific Northwest in the bad old days (late 19th, early 20th century), and it described how lumber industry workers who were being treated callously took revenge by doing shit work -- radical socialist organizers used a slogan akin to ""shit work for shit pay"". Vice versa, right now in the 21st century, Valve has become quite famous as a successful company for basing its employment concept on abolishing hierarchy and fostering community. A WaPo article about the company quoted Gary Miller, author of *Managerial Dilemmas*:

&gt;Miller argues that firms are really successful when they can create trust-based reciprocity, in which the business promises to look after their employees over the longer run in return for their employees making extra efforts that are difficult to measure but hugely beneficial for the firm as a whole. If employees suspect that in a crunch their employer will side with anonymous shareholders rather than with them, it’ll be difficult to create this kind of relationship.

In short, sure, I can imagine your argument holding true. But I can easily also see the opposite of your argument being right. In my personal experience, when I had a boss who was nice to me (and I've been lucky more often than not), I didn't take advantage; I worked harder because I felt I owed her. When I had a boss who was ""not so nice"" (to put it kindly) - not that she broke any rules or paid me less or anything, but just was very rude and aggressive - I started feeling completely unmotivated and had to force myself to do even the slightest thing for her. But that's just personal anecdote - what are you basing your take on? Because you sound pretty sure about it.",0,1387239677,null,0,false,0,ce3fpnn,t3_1szz4n,t1_ce3fpnn,t1_ce381hb,null,1428102961,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Levy really rates Sherwood....they have been talking about it for a few seasons on the other boards how Sherwood is Levy's golden child.

Most seem to think that Levy was grooming Sherwood to be a future front office maestro and that before determining that he would bring in Baldini to be DoF Levy was ready to give the position to Sherwood. 

In one article today they said that the ultimate decision to not turn Sherwood into the DoF was because they rated his work with the youth teams so highly that they felt he could be a quality manager, (and incidentally if he has management experience and he ends up as a DoF or Chairman he now has a good idea what to look for in a manager).

Personally it feels a bit of a risk to me.  Because he has no managerial experience at the top flight it means that he doesn't have the experience to avoid the points that managers slip up in that are normally learned at a lower level. Add into that the fact that he has been so favored by the front office and you can come across as naive and be resented by players which in all honesty we can't afford to have happen.

On the other hand, if he is as good as some think he could be....we may have found our building block for the club.  Which is a huge, HUGE upside.

Reports in Milan say Inter are eager to sell. The majority of Internazionale fans are unhappy with him and are ready for Kovačić to take his place so they can use the money for a forward. 

He's underperformed for most of this season but he's played in a more advanced midfield role; he prefers to sit deeper. He has a great shot from range and has a strong pressing game when he's in the mood. 

If Chelsea do sign him he could play in the pivot with Mikel or Ramires.

Sturridge Def need to start. He provides a whole new dimension at the front thats irreplaceable. 

I'm hoping agger will do what skrtel did. Keep his head up and keep on trying to get better and force his way back into the team. Which is why rodgers bought all these defenders.. To create competition. 

Enrique might have to be eased into the side again. He has been away for quite a while. Flanno, given his recent awesome run of games, is still a young pup. We got to remember its hard for young players to stay consistent. So there will def be room for Enrique to slot back.

What would have been David Tennant's fourth series was instead those three specials, with the End of Time being a two-parter. These can be produced ad-hoc to allow the actors or crew to work on other projects, have no maximum run time, and are aired as needed.

The Christmas Specials are the only consistently-produced Specials, although where they fall in the overall story arc varies. David Tennant's first episode was the Christmas Invasion Special, the very first one produced of the New Who. This year's Christmas special, Time of the Doctor, will be Matt Smith's final episode.

and then for the defense just moving the amc next to holtby and pushing sandro back just above the back line.

I want to see a more narrow attack centred through the middle instead of this outdated crossing game hoping to get the ball to soldado, No top teams are utilizing this tactic for a reason...It's fine for low level teams but if we hope to do better and achieve champions league level football we need to do away with crossing. Our players have enough flair and technique to pass well through the middle, it may take time to get used to a new tactic but it would be very worth it in the long run.",0,1387248614,null,0,1387248940,0,ce3jo9d,t3_1t1tl1,t1_ce3jo9d,t3_1t1tl1,null,1428101112,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

Some asshat empty suit at the Beeb decided that if *Doctor Who* was a children's show, then its main character must be a circus clown. Everyone else associated with the show, including Colin Baker, said ""well, I like being employed.""

From [here](http://www.toplessrobot.com/2011/01/6_ways_the_sixth_doctor_from_doctor_who_got_screwe.php):

&gt; Anyone with a pair of functioning eyeballs can point out the most obvious problem with this Doctor within seconds: that coat, those pants, that horrible baby-blanket tie. This clown vomit outfit, decreed by producer John Nathan Turner, is notorious to fans and has become kind of emblematic of all the other garish shit thrown at us during this era, from the vulgar Vervoids to Bonnie Langford's hair. It wasn't until decades later that we found out Colin agreed with us, and that his idea for a costume would have been something darker and more uniform to go with his Doctor's darker personality (watch the above clip and notice how much pain goes away after his costume ""regenerates""). The harsh blow of his duds has also been lessened in recent years with the appearance of the far more palatable blue variant costume, which, while not ""official"", has shown up on the cover of audio dramas and even in action figure form. 

EDIT: Watch the video on that page, with C. Baker being interviewed about his costume. It's very good.

Managers should always be learning and they need to make mistakes and get caught in pitfalls so they can learn to avoid them in the future, its much easier to do this at the lower levels when every journo in the UK isn't waiting for you to make a mistake, when 50% of the fan base is wondering why you aren't Guardiola and when the players aren't wondering why the hell they should listen to you.

He does have a very specific ethos that is very rigid and demanding of the players, but unlike AVB, I feel his approach would fit the players we currently have.

Bielsa is the guy Guardiola imitated and evolved from when forging his Barca side (Guardiola regards Bielsa as the best manager in the world right now).  His sides have been young, inexperienced teams blessed with pace and potential that he has moulded into frightening attacking forces.  He loves fast, direct play, utilising a high press all across the pitch and rapid distribution of the ball.  He's less of a possession idealogue than AVB and Guardiola, and unlike AVB, he doesn't have a rigid formation and is willing to experiment with all kinds of things, including a back three (a rarity among modern managers).

His profile is almost ideal for us... he is a maverick coach with strong ideals who hasn't yet cemented his place in the upper echelon of managers.

Unfortunately, it is canon that the Sixth Doctor chose that outfit, as it appeared onscreen. It is also canon that the Eighth Doctor is half-human. It is also canon that the Second Doctor never regenerated. It is also canon that the Daleks were ""created"" by Davros, even though they were really merely humanoid Kaleds mutated in a nuclear war. It is canon that the Doctor's full name is ""Doctor Who."" 

These may be canon, but they were mistakes. Mistakes made by people who did not understand the show they were working on. Mistakes by people who did not care about continuity. Mistakes made on a show that has been going on for five decades.

Now, you can argue that a shitty costume is not a continuity error. But it is. Because, while the Doctor's personality varies a bit across regenerations, he is still fundamentally the same person. A person who would not dress like a circus clown. A dandy, yes. But not a clown. The Doctor relies on the force of his personality and his appearance to get things done. He can't get anything done if he is an object of derision. Even the Fourth Doctor, the most eccentric of all Doctors, would not dress in that outfit.

But there is one Doctor who *especially* would not dress that way. (Actually, two — could you imagine Nine in such an outfit, for any reason?) And this is the most important point of all:

THE SIXTH DOCTOR WOULD NOT WEAR THAT OUTFIT.

As written, The Sixth Doctor would not be caught dead in such a getup. Yet it's the first thing he does. This is just bad writing. Inconsistent. A decision made by a man who hated the show, and wanted it to fail. 

Sabotage.

Caring about a show means *caring about a show*. And when the showrunners screw up, well, you don't abandon the show, unless it's *Enterprise*. But you don't take it lying down. You say, *no. That's wrong. The Doctor would not do that.*

And the Beeb, as ever, says ""go screw yourself.""",0,1387255027,null,0,false,1,ce3mluu,t3_1t1b4r,t1_ce3mluu,t1_ce3li9r,null,1428099731,15,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,15

What you meant to break it down to was the point you understand them to be hypocritical with their logic. That by denying one point you claim is in the Quran they are in fact to be considered non-practicing heretics and thereby pointing out the flawed nature of being religious. Just like how some Christians ignore hallowed tenants of their own belief structure and so on. 

Well, well done, religious logic is often loopy, relying on a personal understanding called faith. And yes it would be a lovely world if people didn't have to lean on such ideas but some do and they choose to believe and they're not harming anyone. Pointing out inconsequential flaws over and over won't help anything. I'd rather have people claiming to be muslim not killing anyone than people who do the opposite. Just like how there are a lot that don't kill today. And isn't it great?

It felt like she was just a whiny puppy for a while.

Then I rewatched her episodes and realized it was the Doctor who was kind of terrible in those episodes and Martha is amazing. She was the one saving his ass for most of her episodes. Martha didn't appear to the Doctor because she's the most important person in the universe like most of the other companions in the new series. Martha didn't earn her keep by being a mystery. She constantly saved the Doctor and supported him full time (Family of Blood and in Blink).",0,1387255625,null,0,false,0,ce3mvs6,t3_1t21d2,t1_ce3mvs6,t3_1t21d2,null,1428099602,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

- Mauricio Pochettino (Has done well at Southampton. Seriously doubt they'd let him go, and he possibly wouldn't want to anyway. The Southampton job has far less pressure involved)
- Guus Hiddinck (apparently isn't interested in being another short-term only replacement)
- Luciano Spalletti (transformed Roma into a great cup side and made Zenit dominant in Russia. Under contract, probably has little intention of leaving)
- Fabio Capello (Obviously talented, but he's getting on a bit. And hasn't managed at club level since 2007. Wouldn't be available until after the World Cup anyway)
- Murat Yakin (I think he's the fashionable name to include, largely based on those two wins against Chelsea)
- Frank de Boer (Similar style tactics to Martin Jol, but with defensive solidity. Could be a good choice and is possibly in a position to move from Ajax)
- Jurgen Klinsmann (I'm not entirely sure of his managerial potential, given his only club level experience was at Bayern for less than a year)

- Harry Redknapp (Would Levy even consider asking him to return?)

- Glenn Hoddle (Get serious people. He's not managed a squad since 2006 at Wolves. And he's never been that good a manager anyway)

- Tim Sherwood &amp; co (Seems to have the club politics down. Quite likely knows the players. He has the playing experience to go with under-21 coaching, but do you trust the job to a managerial newb?)

true,Frosstbyte,null,null,"There are a few major reasons.  The first is simply that she isn't Rose.  In the same way that people were intensely attached to Tennant and therefore deeply resistant to Matt Smith when he started, Martha was just not Rose, and because of that people didn't like her because she was a change.  And unlike Smith, who got three and a half seasons to win us over, Martha only got one.

The second reason is because people very fundamentally misunderstand why Martha starts the season ""in love"" with the Doctor.  People think this has to do with an attempt to retread Rose's storyline, and stop there.  That's not at all what Martha's storyline is.  Rose's is a terrible tragedy.  An average girl falls in love with someone who is very much not human, who falls in love with her, and she gives up her entire existence to be with him and then, due to the simple fact that he *is* the Doctor, she loses everything.  Don't kid yourself about Rose getting what she wants with the metacrisis Doctor.  He is mortal, he looks like 10, and he has his memories, but much of what Rose falls in love with is the fact that she can travel all of space and time with someone who **isn't** human.  Metacrisis 10 is none of those things.  Her story is one of fundamentally misunderstanding what the Doctor is, giving everything she has to give to be with him, *and not getting any of it*.  Her father still dies.  She loses her boyfriend.  She barely gets her mom, and she's sealed in an alternate universe.  Hers is a cautionary tale.

Martha's story, on the other hand, is one of showing how experience with the Doctor can enrich your life.  Martha is the *only* modern companion who has no ""magical moment.""  She is not Bad Wolf, she is not Doctor Donna, she's not the impossible girl, she doesn't re-originate the universe with a thought.  She is smart, capable, and successful before the Doctor ever gets to her, and, also unlike every other modern companion, she **chooses** to leave him, and in so choosing, gets everything she wants.  She achieves success, she finds love, and she gets to help the Doctor (or at least further his mission of protecting the earth from outside threats) for the rest of her life.

Unfortunately, a lot of people get stuck on the ""She loves Ten and she isn't Rose"" and ignore the very powerful message of the rest of Martha's story.  The Doctor is, and has always been, a madman with a box.  He is not human.  He loves humanity, but he does not understand what it means to *be* human.  Martha sees this, and she decides to take what she has learned from him to be a better person.  Every other modern companion doesn't understand this and tries to choose to travel the universe with him forever.  And every other companion, so far, loses everything they have.  They might find other happiness and other lives, but they never get what they really want, which, very fundamentally, is to be with the Doctor forever.

Martha is a great companion and, you're right, she gets a lot of hate because her story lacks the romanticism and tragedy of other stories.  More's the pity.",0,1387257716,null,0,false,0,ce3nqid,t3_1t21d2,t1_ce3nqid,t3_1t21d2,null,1428099204,183,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,183

While the pressing game worked wonders against this Spurs team that could barely score from open play, we can't be certain it will work against others. City and Chelsea will be the big tests of this. 

I worry that those top class teams won't let the ball slip away so cheaply as Spurs did, and that we won't enjoy as much of the possession as we did on Sunday. This would mean our Reds will have to be running and gunning at the opposition more often to win the ball, leaving us open to deadly breaks from the likes of Hazard, Jesus Navas, etc. 

This is where Gerrard comes in as a sweeping midfielder; there are few players in the world even at the moment that can make open-field tackles like Stevie can. His performances of late have been questionable and he doesn't deserve starting based on them, but I think that is largely due to him over-estimating what his old legs could do in terms of box-to-box attack. He may not like it, but he has to pick his runs a lot more sharply and less frequently. If he does that, he will be in a INVALUABLE asset to this Liverpool side.

I'm not even sure that it has truly settled in yet.  Sure the man is not infallible by any means but I have been a staunch supporter of his from day one.  He led us to our best premier league points total and a solid start (points-wise) this season.  

The logical and realistic part of me understands this decision to a certain extent.  There were problems with the way we were playing, and it seems there were other problems in the inner workings of the club as well.  However, I just can't support firing him 16 matches into the season.  I just can't do it.  Having performed the way he had through the first season and a third, he deserved a full 2 seasons to prove himself.  It's just depressing and disheartening.

I think he is a brilliant manager tactically (maybe defensive at times but wins games), very devoted to his cause but perhaps not that great in man management and motivating his players. Alienating Alonso and wanting to bring in Barry just highlights that. 

Rodgers is incredible. He came in when Liverpool was not in a good state. He now gets us to play attractive football and winning games in about a season and a half.

You wanna know the right way? (For the club to go forward)

Pop into a pub called The Alexandra in Wimbledon on a Saturday lunchtime when both Chelsea and AFC Wimbledon are at home. 

Look at the swathes of Chelsea fans looking enviously over at the pockets of AFC fans, 10 years ago they looked at them with pity, now they look at them with Envy. Yes, Chelsea can boast about winning the Champions League, FA Cups and Premier League titles in that time, but they also (deep down) know it all means jack shit, the novelties worn off, half of them won't even be going to the Bridge that afternoon, they either can't afford to or don't even really want to, some will be principled and think they're not going to go and plough another £60 into a club that pays some of its Players £150k a week, but they'll look over at those AFC fans, drinking and laughing with each other, looking forward to going to see if they can overcome Mansfield, debating whether the Left Back they picked up from Staines in the Summer can hack it at this level or not, wondering what next for their Club, and those Chelsea fans will be reminded of Kerry Dixon and David Speedie, of paying their £4 to sit on them benches they used to have in their West Stand, of when Football was fun, of when they really could say they were Chelsea, of when they felt they belonged to that club, and of when that club belonged to them, and they'll think of the Chelsea that exists today and have to wipe a tear from their eye.

If they're really observant they might also notice the cunt of a Leeds fan standing at the end of the bar watching them watching the AFC fans, and they might notice he's laughing his bollocks of at them, but also (deep down) he's also hoping that never happens to Leeds.

All the work and transport in the one place.

In Australia, you'd never think about getting a job and commuting to another capital city because it's 1000km away. You'd move capital cities. 

People do commute in from minor cities to capital cities. The rail links are fairly direct and CHEAP. None of this multi-websites to find cheap tickets bullshit.

In the UK, the villages, towns and cities are spread out evenly over the country. So it means that, to get to work, you need to travel to the next village/town/city. i.e. 10min to 1hr drive from most places.

Chances are there isn't a time efficient public transport option between every single set of two points on the map, so people are forced to drive. I think the car culture here is stronger than in the majority of Australia. i.e. people mostly living in urban areas

I don't think there's much that can be done about it either. Reducing the cost of train fares would help as it's cheaper to drive than to catch the train (unless you live right in London).

I understand that the purpose of the B6 and B1 was for liver function, but not the multivitamin. I mean it's not like I'd stopped eating through this period in my life and was vitamin deficient.

Also separate studies from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health ( same university, different department ) contradict this report too:  

&gt; Peter Zandi PhD with Johns Hopkins School of Public Health stated, ""These results are extremely exciting. Our findings suggest that vitamins E and C may offer protection against Alzheimer's disease when taken together in the higher doses available from individual supplements.""

&gt;Another study also in the Archives of Neurology found that Vitamin E intake may slow the progression of cognitive decline as we grow older.

&gt;How does Vitamin E do this? Well, remember some of the benefits of Vitamin E cited above and how Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant? It is widely accepted that oxidative stress plays a role in the bringing about Alzheimer's. And by its antioxidant properties, Vitamin E is able to reduce this oxidative stress to the cells of your brain.

Why therefore are the scientists from different departments of the same university contradicting each other with these studies? 

And

&gt;Jeffrey Blumberg, Ph.D., F.A.C.N. of Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts states ""... surveys of over 200,000 people in different communities around the world have provided compelling evidence that diets high in vitamin E and/or use of vitamin E supplements reduce the risk of heart disease.""

And

&gt;Two other studies were reported on in the New England Journal of Medicine, the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. These two studies followed thousands of women and men. The researchers found a significant reduction in heart disease of the folks taking Vitamin E supplements.

It's both sad and funny as I sail past the huge tail backs of cars on my way home in Leeds.  Many of the people in those cars do not need to be there, but I also don't blame them for not cycling.  I find it immensely fun and rewarding, but can certainly understand why someone would be put off cycling on our roads as it stands.

Not only is there money to be saved by reducing congestion, the more people that cycle, the fitter and healthier the nation becomes.  Less pollution, more liveable streets, reduction in road deaths.

(a)that he had no reason to believe that there was any person within hearing or sight who was likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress, or

In terms of it's usefulness - PRINCE2 is like a receipe rather than cookery lessons ie it tells you what to do when on a project but not the how. Often people go on a PRINCE2 course and think (or worse seel themselves) as a project manager. It's like reading the highway code and calling yourself a driver. PRINCE2 itself is really good, really useful and recognised beyond the UK.  It's really big in Australia (along with other related methods) and the new 'owner' of PRINCE2 (a company called Alexos) aims to make it into a globally recognised method (it's not really recognised in the States at this point.) If the person wants to be come a proejct manager, I suggest they supplement the PRINCE2 course with an the APMP course from the Association for Project Management - this is the equivavlent of the cookery lessons.

The basic implication is the same. ""Making a career"" has the result of being paid more. You are implying that they hold the opinion they do in order to advance their careers - essentially a corrupt reason - and not because it is their genuinely held expert opinion. It's a trick as hold as the hills when scientific views are divided: those you agree with are presenting their honest expert opinion, those you disagree with are cynical careerists.

I agree that there is no unconditional consensus of scientists on the issue. My point is that the portion of scientists who believe in legalization are not 'lobbyists for legalization' any more than those against are 'lobbyists for criminalization'. I also think it is wrong to say that being in favour of legalization improves one's career prospects - Nutt was making a fine career with the ACMD and other government positions before his opinions led to him being sacked and having to find funding elsewhere.

true,GetKenny,eng-sussex,South Saxon,"If you were detoxing from alcohol, the likelihood was that you were deficient in certain vitamins - the B vitamins in particular because of the alcohol, but vitamins in general because alcoholics often don't eat very well.

For most of us, who are eating a reasonable diet and are healthy, every health professional I've talked to (I've recently come out of hospital after a long illness) says that we get more than enough vitamins and minerals from our normal diet.  This included talking to specialist consultants, doctors, nurses, Occupational Therapists and dieticians.

There may be the odd exception, one example is where dark skinned people living North of somewhere around Birmingham may have to supplement vitamin D because of the lack of sunshine and the way their skin absorbs less. Smokers may need extra vitamin C.  For the rest of us, taking large amounts of vitamins may be harmful - vitamin C supplements can form kidney stones in some people for example, and most doctors will advise against prolonged high doses of vitamin E.  Generally the excess water soluble vitamins (C and the Bs) will be peed out.  Fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E &amp; K) when taken in excess of what the body needs are stored in the liver, and can be much more problematic if allowed to build up over time.

As for the studies where there is 'compelling evidence' of some sort of health benefit for taking vitamin X, well I suppose you just have to take an overall view of the weight of evidence available.  New studies and newly reported opinions of doctors and researchers always carry more weight, sometimes just because they are newsworthy for a time.  How many times have we been told that wine/chocolate/coffee is good for you/bad for you?

Our basic instincts are usually right.  They tell us that a balanced diet in terms of salt, sugar, fat, fibre, vitamins and minerals is the best one, and the most reliable evidence we have that has stood the test of time backs this up.

His opponents here may not be skilful debaters, but their argument is vastly more difficult to enunciate than his.

**Pros**

- Cheaper deposits (no transfer fees, no exchange rates).

- Less [verification](https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/verification) required.
- Verification is faster.

- No banks involved, so you (as a customer) won't have transactions frozen, or risk your bank account being closed permanently.

- Extra security for customers (2fa login, optional 3fa, and 2fa coin withdrawal).

- You can day trade on the IBWT platform.

- You can trade in Litecoin also (other viable altcoins being introduced in future development).

- You can also trade in USD and Euro (and deposit USD and Euro, perhaps if you went on holiday, came back, and still have some holiday money you want to get rid of, cheaper than using Thomas Cook or any other similar exchange) - USD/Euro &gt; Btc/Ltc &gt; Gbp &gt; withdraw.

- You're not giving your money to the banks (banks own your money when you give it to them, important for some, not so much for others).

- No need to wait for a buyer or seller. IBWT is an Exchange, where you can place Buy/Sell Orders or meet Orders instantly, without the other party needing to be present/online.

- £0 deposit/withdrawal costs if you deposit/withdraw in person, Plymouth (currently contact support@ibwt.co.uk for this service, it will be added into the platform over the next couple of weeks).

- Deposits/withdrawals are fully covered by Royal Mail.

- There is essentially no limits to deposits/withdrawals, no banks to freeze transactions.

- Deposits/withdrawals take 1-3 days (depending on the day you deposits/requested a withdrawal, and depending on whether a bank holiday falls on one of those days).

- You can deposit/withdraw on Saturdays, and will be processed on Saturdays (I'm unaware of any other Exchange that works on a Saturday, due to banking limitations).

- Expanding internationally, very soon.

- You only need to register an email to create an IBWT account and start day trading.

- IBWT wallet services are completely free.

- There are no buy/sell limits.

- There are no account limits.

- 0 risk of charge-backs.

**Cons**

- Only re-launched 4 weeks ago, liquidity is relatively low still (we expect it to pick up after Christmas).

- Sending deposits via Royal Mail can feel uncomfortable for some, however [Royal Mail's Special Delivery](http://www.royalmail.com/parcel-despatch-low/uk-delivery/special-delivery) is specifically setup for sending hard currency.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"By numerous accounts and dating back several years ago Levy feels very strongly that Tim Sherwood is someone who has a long prosperous future with the club ahead of him.

Sherwood has been described as effectively being Levy's ""Golden Boy"" who has been getting groomed to be a front office executive.  It was reported that Levy was close to naming Sherwood the DoF before naming Baldini. The story in the media is that the decision was made because Levy and others felt that Sherwood's ability was best suited as a manager.

From the articles out there i don't think the decision to remove AVB was an emotional outburst.  It really sounds like all parties were done with the situation.  AVB seemed worn down and Spurs did as well, the early reports make it sound very much like this was a situation that just needed to end for all involved.

Personally i think that Levy and Baldini are a pretty smart pair of individuals. Guessing that they felt that Sherwood was worth a look especially when the managers that they would want would be tough signings at this point of the year. Sherwood already knows the players, the coaches, the training staff so it would be a quick transition. If nothing else turning the reigns over to Sherwood for a few games lets them feel out people like De Boer and Yakin and see what the possibility of buying them out of their respective contracts is without much risk.  If Sherwood crashes and burns they can move him out and install one of the managers that they want if he succeeds he can effectively buy himself time.

I am pretty sure that when they sacked AVB and the plan always was for Sherwood to take the reigns (at least temporarily) and see what he is capable of. Levy may think some of these other manager candidates are the ones who can lead the club forward but he is going to give Sherwood first run.

~38% of earnings gone to servicing mortgage debt. 

It's not as black and white as it seems. When you take London out of the equation the numbers become entirely more sane. The house price numbers come tumbling down but the wage numbers don't move quite as drastically. 


Plus there's still plenty of sub £50K houses in England! Just not in the south.

Because if you look at how it was done prior to that, it was always very rough and different each time. Not like the all glowy regeneration cycle that he has shown for each regeneration since then. Meaning the War Doctor was around for all of those 800 years. Making him the longest lasting regeneration of them all, with the original being the next longest, and 11 the third longest.

As to why 11 hasn't shown much aging for having been around nearly as long as the William Hartnell incarnation, who theoretically grew from being an infant to the older man we saw 50 years ago, remember that River/Melody decided she was going to age backwards that last time she regenerated.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"Firstly, what's your source for this assertion? I tried to find a list of Guardian journalists and the best I could find was the [list of frequent contributors on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian#Notable_regular_contributors_.28past_and_present.29). Doesn't say anything about ethnicity, social or education background.

I can't show that they *aren't* all middle/upper class Oxbridge educated, but it's very presumptuous to assume they are based on absolutely nothing at all.

Secondly, diversity doesn't mean to hire people based on racial or social quotas. You don't show diversity by hiring 25% white, 25% black, 25% east asian, 25% south asian. You show diversity by hiring based on ability, not on background. Race should neither count for or against you in an application.

Again, there is nothing to suggest that the Guardian (or any other newspaper for that matter) has been racist in its hiring practices.

Thirdly, what exactly is wrong with hiring Oxbridge graduates? Are you one of those people who assumes that everyone who came from Oxbridge must automatically be middle/upper class, affluent and elitist? I won't deny that there are colleges notorious for this, but this is a very unfair generalisation over the vast majority of diverse colleges in Oxford and Cambridge. Oxbridge accepts students based purely on merit, and graduates them also based purely on merit.

Why are so many Oxbridge graduates in high flying positions? It's because they're smart and they earned it. I may not agree with his political ideology, but I would never suggest that David Cameron is not a very smart man. He is just not a moral man. Most of the people coming out of Oxbridge are perfectly good people who got an excellent education. If you ran a company and could afford to hire them, why wouldn't you?

Finally, you don't have to be living in poverty and starvation to comment and report on poverty and starvation. The fact that these allegedly white, middle/upper class Oxbridge graduates spend all their working life trying to raise awareness of the plight of the poor, the unemployed and the exploited surely shows that they can't possibly be elitist as well. If they were, they'd be writing an elitist newspaper, it's not like there isn't a market for that!

Technology and the toys we have do not say anything about how well off we are.

For example, the London rioters and looters were condemned for having Blackberries and people dismissed their status as being in poverty for that reason. That is a sign of technological times, not a sign of financial or how well off we are. 

The one thing I always tell my father is that when he was my age the population of the entire world was half of what it is today. So in one generation the amount of people on this earth has doubled. I cannot live on my own on a basic minimum wage income, I would have to make the most of foodbanks and every form of government support.

The problem is clearly those who have the money. Not BECAUSE they have money, but because they want more without having to put that much into the economy or job market, so they cut corners, fire people make the remaining staff do twice the work for half as much. It all comes down to one thing which can show how bad of a situation this country is in in regards to doing well for yourself, and this is Zero hour contracts. They're a slap in the face to those who want to work and earn their money.

&gt;rehab...doesn't make people hardened into actual criminals while sending them into a completely pointless and repetitive process of arrest and re-arrest.

Agree with that; I don't think prison is the solution. At the same time I think that to call Hitchens some kind of fool for thinking that willpower is enough just strikes me as ignorant. Willpower is ultimately what will get the person off the addicted substance and into productivity, and I'm inclined to think that people can do it for themselves if they want it badly enough.

I don't disagree with rehab, provided the argument is framed the right way. People in rehab who want to be there will likely succeed, because they have made the choice to seek help because they want to get to a particular place, mentally, emotionally, spiritually or physically. But throwing people into rehab is just a waste of resources. I don't think it can work, because willpower is the underlying factor of a person's ability to change. You can't change a person by subjecting them to a process or a system or a curriculum. You can, however, assist those who want to change. So I don't think Hitchens' is wrong, and I don't think he's entirely right either.

It should be ovious to a smart man like Hitchens that the law alone is not enough to stop crime. Back when capital punishment was legal in the UK we still had murders - the 'deterrent' of losing your life was no enough to stop some people.

The same goes with any crime. Law and criminal sanctions are PART of the many ways in which we can control crime - control being the word, because we can't STOP it.

So really the question comes down to have the least crime possible. Yes, you could shoot all criminals on sight and that would limit some crime - but I think most people who don't read the Daily Express would argue that's a bit much.

How best do we deal with drug-related crimes? Is it by locking up drug addicts? Because we all know how drug-free prison is and how being locked up with other criminals is the best way to avoid crime when you are released. 

At some point there has to be rehabilitation. Why not BEFORE a drug addict is sent to prison. Why not try to STOP a person descending into other crime to support their habit? What's WRONG with that?

It's wrong in the eyes of the likes of Peter Hitchens because it offends his delicate sensibilities of how an 'ideal' world should be.

There's a good chance that the alternative: not paying for their rehab, and treating them as criminals, would be a false economy. 

*If* the treatment works, then it would almost certainly cost the taxpayer less money than a jury trial, incarceration, and subsequent likely reoffending. If this reoffending takes the form of relapsing into drug use then this can lead to health issues which can be treated at the taxpayer's expense on the NHS, and could lead to being caught up in the criminal justice system again, with more expensive court cases and incarcerations.

As long as the treatment has some minimum success rate, then it would save the country money because addicts and other criminals cost the country money.

&gt; But after the derby, when they had a huge disagreement over the team’s approach and the substitutions, Villas-Boas promoted Luis Martins and relegated Freund in the seating positions.

&gt; Martins, who arrived at Tottenham with Villas-Boas when he was appointed in 2012, became the manager’s primary confidant. Inevitably it created tensions at the training ground and Freund felt alienated as his role vanished.

&gt; Levy was also concerned with the team’s identity and he reminded Villas-Boas that playing football with style and some swagger is a prerequisite for any Tottenham side.
&gt; Preparation was everything to Villas-Boas, something that factored heavily in his favour when he was chosen to replace Harry Redknapp as manager.

&gt; Despite this reputation, Gary Neville's remarkable analysis on Sky's Monday Night Football on November 25, the day after the 6-0 defeat at City, suggested Spurs' players were no longer responding to his methods.

There are several oil company sites (Chevron, Statoil) that give good, objective information, but I won't link them for fear of being labelled a corporate shill.

Please note, I am NOT a rabid Hydraulic Fracturing Advocate. I simply hate the fact that debate on the subject is shut down by one sided ravings.

I think that Frac'ing, if done safely, could provide an important source of income and energy for the UK at a time when we desperately need both. I'm also only too aware of the negative environmental impacts of MANY mining and extraction methods when allowed to go unchecked.

2007 Merseyside derby (Everton v. Liverpool) at Goodison Park, Blues were up 1-0 at halftime.

The referee, one Mark Twattenburg, puts in the most blatant one-sided performance in footballing history; among the many issues:

* Awarded a penalty to Liverpool for a foul that was CLEARLY outside the box, leveling the game at 1-1
* Had pulled out a yellow card to book Tony Hibbert for the tackle, but after talking one-on-one with Steven Gerrard, proceeded to put it back in his pocket and give a straight red card - showing he was clearly influenced by the player, not to mention the fact that the tackle likely didn't even merit a yellow
* [Only awarded a yellow for what has been described as a ""two-footed kung-fu tackle"" by Dirk Kuyt on Phil Neville](http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/10_03/Kuyt2210DMPA_468x306.jpg) which, given the previous incident, should have also been a red if going by the same standard
* Gave another penalty, as well as a controversial red card to Phil Neville for a handball, ensuring we finished with 10 men
* In the dying moments of the game, despite awarding two sketchy penalties to Liverpool, failed to award a penalty to Everton for a [CLEAR foul on Joleon Lescott](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHX1hBItnDQ), perhaps the most obvious penalty in the history of football, and he had a clear view of the incident.

A number of other issues were that:

* Clattenburg had travelled with the Liverpool squad on their preseason tour of Asia
* Rumors that he was a vocal Liverpool supporter raised questions of whether he should have been involved in such a match
* [David Moyes was charged by the FA for criticizing Clattenburg's performance](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/27/newsstory.everton), but the charges were mysteriously and quietly dropped - rumor has it that Moyes went to the FA with clear video evidence of the many incidents, and the FA withdrew the charges to keep the whole issue quiet.
* Clattenburg never admitted fault, but was dropped from refereeing Premier League matches for the next week, and didn't return for some time.
* Clattenburg *coincidentally* didn't referee another Everton match until 2012 (five years later), despite a rotation system designed to avoid this, and hasn't been back to Goodison at all

There are likely other incidents/issues that I forgot to mention. Needless to say, many Blues are bitter against Clattenburg personally, but also against the FA",0,1387288227,null,0,false,0,ce3u1g7,t3_1t0xs1,t1_ce3u1g7,t1_ce3lxz7,null,1428096251,4,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,4

This appears to be the worst logic anyone could ever conceive.  The argument over have we done a greater good than if we hadn't intervened is always moot as there is no way of knowing.  

Had the terrorist attacks of the early 2000's occurred but instead of having the retaliatory approach we took an approach of leading by example - building a better, more stable and cohesive society that showed compassion to other countries - we could have acknowledged that although grossly damaging, terrorism is still a minority fraction and mainly isolated.  

By taking the action that we and the US took, Islamic countries that had little reason to terrorise us wouldn't.  Afgan would still be a highly tribal land, crimes against human rights would still be being carried out, but we would at least have the position of impartial aid to the bulk population, rather than being feared by a whole nation and hated for any form of intervention.

What Cameron is saying, and very wrongly, is that we've done what we intended to do; remove a societal structure.  The massive failing that will endure for many many more generations will be the vacuum caused by this action.  Countless more will die, and ultimately, return to the same state it was previously.

So I don't think Hitchens' is wrong, and I don't think he's entirely right either. But ultimately I disagree with wholesale transformation of how we treat drug abuse on the idea that rehab is 'nicer'. It can work but not 'by default'.

I agree with this. Empiricism is it's own addiction (""WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE!?!?!?! I MUST HAVE A *p* VALUE!!!"") and I think it gets in the way of common sense sometimes.

No word on Hart or Panti in net but I'm expecting Hart even though I'd prefer Panti to get an easy game under his belt after his nightmare the other day.  He could do with that before we go back to the PL.

This could be a really good game for Dzeko to show some goalscoring form and boost him back into contention for a first team spot.  To be honest, he's well behind Negredo and needs to hit the back of the net more if he's ever going to get a run of games, which he needs this season as he's the big hope of Bosnia going into a World Cup.

No word on Guidetti but I don't expect him to be in the squad.  This is really the type of game he needs to be playing for us but with Jovetic and Dzeko both needing the time and him playing 70 minutes for the EDS on Sunday, I highly doubt he travelled with the squad.  Mind you, Lopes played 45 minutes in that same match so what do I know?

Kompany needs the rest after his injury lay off recently so it will probably be Lescott next to Boyata, which isn't the type of defence that makes you overconfident but they can hopefully do a job.  Boyata played as a right back at Bolton and a couple of times at City, so he could potentially slot in there for Zab who will need the rest with Richards injured, leaving Lescott and Demichelis as the two.  If Pellegrini is really brave, he could potentially bring in one of the young lads from the EDS here but I imagine he'll go with Javi Garcia if he wants to rest Demi.

This would leave a gap for Jack Rodwell to get into the team and continue his comeback from injury.

2. Sherwood, Ramsey and Ferdinand has marvellous coherence through the club since Sherwood is close to Levy, they've been coaching the young uns and will now take charge of the first team. In one fell swoop it opens dialogue up throughout the club, which after all was the point of spending £40m on a training ground and concentrating effort on becoming self sustaining and bringing players through.

3. By the time he joined us as a player, he was a little over the hill - but I DO remember him as a tenacious, vocal, WINNER as Captain for the title winning Blackburn Rover's side. He probably is quite ruthless - he was captain to huge personalities(/egos) like Shearer, Le Saux, Batty, Sutton, and Colin Hendry...anyone who remembers these players...knows that's quite an assortment of BIG characters to keep under control. 

4. Sherwood scouted ISCO who is now playing for Madrid but could have been playing for us, AVB said no (from JJ, ITK)

5. Apparently has an Arsenal tattoo on his upper arm?

6. The lack of top-flight managerial experience with Sherwood compared to AVB does not bother me.

7. Before coming to us AVB had just 9 months more experience of managing in the Premier League and no experience of playing in it. Yes, he had a season at Porto but he was never a player so can't have the same understanding of players that Sherwood will have.

Sherwood knows the club inside and out, the first teamers to the youth players. He's got Les, Freund, Ramsey alongside him, the support of Levy - and no pressure to be a permanent successor. Whether it's permanent or not all comes down to him.

8. A very close member of my family does legal work for Sherwood. All I have ever heard from him is what extremely nice and grounded individual Tim is. Apparently, TS recently turned down a very lucrative offer from another club to remain at Spurs and is highly regarded around Europe. Tim is fiercely ambitious and wants to make a name for himself at the club. I do know that JJ's info re: Isco is correct btw, and that AVB didn't want to take him - much to the chagrin of TS who had spent a great deal of time with the player (who was happy to sign for us!).

There are always two sides to each story. I appreciate there are some angry fans who are accusing Sherwood of meddling but...fact is Tim gets on with everyone else at the club. AVB managed to alienate himself from staff and players - falling out spectacularly with Freund and p*ssing off Vertonghen. The impression I have been given is that this image of AVB as some sort of nice guy is widely distorted. From what I have heard, the man sulked and held contempt for many at the club. That is not to absolve others from blame but this notion AVB has been hard done by is wide off the mark.

Levy and most of the people around the club have been completely enamored with him for a few years. He has gotten rave reviews for his work with the youth sides over the past few years.  Blackburn and Swindon have both interviewed him and said very favorable things and Levy fought like hell to keep him with the club. 

I continually see people say that he has a good footballing mind, that Levy basically treats him as the ""golden child"" and was trying to mold him into someone who could ""run a club"" (presumably Spurs) from the front office. then again there are a number of reports that he has used the fact that he has Levy's ear to undermine AVB and 'Arry's management.

The truth is we have absolutely no idea what we have in Sherwood.  He has never managed a first team squad at any level and even if it is interim we are handing him the reigns to the squad. I would have to figure even if it is only short term that people have a feeling that he is up to the task. 

It is incredibly difficult to be a first time manager at any level there is a learning curve and mistakes will be made, but to be a first time manager in a situation where the team came into the season on huge expectations, has just sacked their manager, where the media will be focused on your performance and waiting to jump all over any mistake and where half the fan base will be pissed because your name isn't Pep Guardiola...well, that is a whole new level of pressure.

Perhaps see the ""insurance disc"" as a basic mandatory third party (fire/theft as well?) insurance, and the fee equatable to paying the excess up front, and need to buy/renew it again after being at-fault in an accident.

I was initially quite miffed (albeit unsurprised) at the sacking yesterday - fearing that despite everything there wasn't a viable replacement who would be an improvement. However, I am now cautiously optimistic about Tim Sherwood taking the reins and seeing how things go. The lack of experience is one issue but if the plan was for him to take over at some point anyway then he would always have had to overcome that - it's not like you can really loan a coach out to gain managing experience at a lower-league club. Being in charge on an initial interim-basis will be a good trial run to see how it goes without the pressure of him needing to impress given our current run and the lack of any real big-name contenders on the horizon.

Lords are experts in particular fields of work. They are not career politicians. If we lose the lords, we lose that domain specific knowledge that politicians do not have. The lords play a key role in advising the career politicians on difficult subjects.

Without having to worry about votes and appeasing people. The lords also have a chance to stop things, or allow things, against the general consensus. Again, these are experts in a field who may understand something much better than the general public where ""accepted knowledge"" just isn't good enough.

&gt; what can we replace it with?

I would be very up for replacing the Lords with an elected body to represent specific expertise/roles. However, who does the voting?

If it's the general public, we have career politicians again. People who know a little about &lt;x&gt; and then go about specialising in being voted the best at &lt;x&gt;.

If it's a select committee, how do we pick who they are. Same issue as above. Maybe we pick industry leaders in specific fields to vote on Lords. But then how do we stop industry bodies or big players pushing their own agenda into the Lords. Again, Lords should be considering the best for society.

He sulked around the pitch looking barely in the mood for half a season then suddenly hit form and scored a bunch right before January and then forced his way out at the 11th hour with a bullshit transfer request at the last minute, leaving us pants down trying to find a replacement (who we got in Andy Carroll and while I love the big guy for his effort and determination to succeed here he just didn't do it for us).  Torres did make a choice and that choice was the jump ship and leave.  Not only that but he went to a premier league rival just to add insult to injury.  He made his bed and now he gets to lay in it.  I feel bad for the guy because it's got to feel terrible to have declined so much so fast on the pitch though.

Suarez tried to do the same this past summer with Arsenal and he really pissed everyone off a lot. Thankfully Henry's magnificent, veiny, indestructible balls took over as he told Suarez to politely shut up and fall back in line.  He's done that now and with the way he's carried on so far this season (clearly not disrupted the other players, looks to get on well with everyone, keeping his head down and playing magnificent football, giving his full effort every run out) he's earning the respect and admiration of the fans back.  What will happen this summer remains to be seen and I personally think he'll be leaving.  But the difference for next time is that I don't think he's going to stay in England when he does go, which will make it easier to stomach for us as fans.  It's always extra painful when your star man switches to a club in the same league because it feels like you lost out double on the situation when your club gets weaker without him and a direct league competitor gets stronger.

The prevailing view on Reddit, which seems to reflect a particularly American fallacy, is that it is inherently rude to attempt to correct someone's error. This simply is not true. Can a person be rude when correcting another person? Of course. Happens all the time. But can you correct someone politely? Appropriately? In a non-judgmental way? Of course. Happens all the time. But people feign offense anyway.

If you cannot be corrected without feeling offense or shame, even on a trivial matter, then something is deeply wrong with you, something important that needs to be addressed.

Are there trivial errors? Of course. ""It's just Talking Heads, not *The* Talking Heads."" ""If it's got vodka in it, it's not a 'martini.'"" ""His name is The Doctor, not Doctor Who."" Are there important errors? Of course. ""No, the Nazis were not socialists."" ""Global Warming is not not a myth, and it is anthropogenic."" ""Homeopathy is not based in reality, and avoiding real treatment will kill you.""

Then there's the stuff that is not life-or-death important, but not trivial, either. Are you a native English speaker who doesn't know the difference between ""they're"" and ""their?"" Your ignorance will most likely not lead to the deaths of a bus full of child nuns. But is your ignorance inexcusable? Yes. Is it the equivalent of not knowing how to zip up your pants? Yes. Is someone wrong for pointing out your inexplicable carelessness and proud ignorance? No.

A knee-jerk rejection of all correction is harmful, because it is not always apparent what facts will turn out to be trivial and what facts will be important.

But let's forget about general principles. Let's limit this specifically to Whovians.

If I'm forbidden from pointing out that someone got my beloved character's name wrong, what you're telling me is that I have no right to care so much about a trivial fictional media property. That an adult expressing so much reverence for a foreign children's show — attending conventions, dressing up like a bizarre dandy, and arguing over the relative merits of various fictional aliens who are in fact British day players in badly-made costumes, is foolish.

And that's fine. You can do that. You can be my mother.

But if you're here to harass and belittle Whovians (or Trekkies or Star Wars geeks or Browncoats or whatever) then do it. Be open about it. Don't pretend you're defending someone's delicate sensibilities, some vaunted principle of politesse.

His name isn't ""Doctor Who."" That's the name of the show. The character's name is ""The Doctor."" That's how it works, even when the show itself gets it wrong.

When good players play in a team built around them they gain a false sense of ability because everything is tailored for them, don't get me wrong they are usually very good players to begin with but their ability is elevated because we only play to their strengths and shield/protect/shun away from playing their weaknesses.

Of course the down side to this is they can become arrogant in their abilities and believe rather than the team elevating them it is them that elevates the team, so they become interested in joining a 'bigger' team problem is the new team may not be willing to change and the player quickly finds that their not as proficient as they thought, then they lose their confidence, then its all down hill from there.

I always hear *'but torres was also good at athletico'* yes he was but we had a much better team and so when we built it around him he became the world class striker we all know and remember and when he moved to chelsea even though they had arguably a better team because they didnt build around him he never really settled in.

Owen was always a good player but injuries fucked up his career, although he moved to Madrid it never worked out because they never played him and they also got fed up of his injuries so he moved to newcastle who also got fed up of his shit and moved to united then to stoke.. none of them gave him the time of day but if he stayed with us we would have

In that case, I'll have a go explaining why that sounds like a bad idea.

Referring specifically to MP's:

There's about 650 MP's, which is quite a lot. The vast majority of which are elected based on voters choosing the party they want to win a general election, as opposed to the individual candidates personal merits. This means that in order to get elected, one does not need to be an exceptionally talented individual who deserves a high remuneration. 

The basic salary for an MP is just over £66k, which is 2-3 times the average UK salary. That's before any of their expenses. I believe they are also paid a salary by their political party, though my google fu is failing me. I'm not sure how much they get. Saying that their pay is ""so low"" is far from accurate. They are already well paid. Plus they are allowed to work in the private sector (most of them do) and earn large sums of money from consultancy work etc. 

According to Private Eye, MP's in the last parliament were 4 times as likely as the general population to end up in prison. Granted this number was skewed by the expenses scandal, but it's still ridiculous. A decent salary will not encourage or attract more honest individuals. 

As for accommodation and travel, I personally agree. MP's are required to be in both their constituency and London. I think the state should provide accommodation for MP's (preferably state owned) to reduce opportunities for abuse.

To your final point of performance related pay, this is a terribly flawed idea. Firstly, you number of votes is highly influenced by your competition, therefore is not a reflection of your own performance. Secondly, as mentioned before, it's mostly a reflection of the public's support for your political party. If a politician is good at their job, they should get to keep it. If not, they should either be voted out by the electorate, or replaced by their own party. Most people don't get performance related pay, would should MP's?",0,1387300154,null,0,false,0,ce3yern,t3_1t2xvt,t1_ce3yern,t1_ce3xz6j,null,1428094213,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Honestly, you weren't. I was quite content to make a general point which included you. You've chosen to turn it into a conversation, which is fine. One of the advantages in not being 23 any more, I've found, is that I care much less what people think of me. 

&gt; But that's the whole thing. It's the employee's OWN PERSONAL LIFE, not the responsibility of their employer.

A good employer, particularly an employer willing to go to the expense of hiring and keeping a reasonably skilled professional, will understand that an employee's quality of life and state of mind are issues that affect their work. This is not a theoretical exercise whereby you come into work and your home life scuttles out of your mind. People are people: stupid, intelligent, complex, simple and everything in between. I'd add, specific to this, that a pub doesn't exactly employs thousands. The wellbeing of your chef - presumably a reasonably senior member of the team - will have a knock-on effect on your relatively small workforce. If you're bright, you'll bear this in mind. You the employer, that is, not you that I'm speaking to. I'm not able to judge how bright you are. 

&gt; There are many ways to run a successful business. The way I was taught is a good one. Differing methods can work well also (look at Valve, for example).

Yes, there are. It was for your parents, in that they were successful, but I have no idea whether they experienced a higher-than-average churn of staff, or a succession of disgruntled employees posting shit through their front door, or anything else. So the lesson here is to remember that your view is just that: a view. As for Valve, they are certainly painted as Elysium with code, but a cursory search would tell you that there are plenty of stories of employees deemed unsatisfactory being really quite precipitately hoofed out of the building. Whether those stories arise from mismatches of personality, lack of ability or anything else is kind of the point. Every has a view, they often differ, and good managers - and I hope I am one - take them into account. 

I'm being slightly disingenuous with you because, frankly, every manager occasionally has to say to people ""We're doing things this way, and that's because I'm in charge and ultimately I make the decisions"". You also take the blame and the credit and you try, where reasonable, to share the latter and minimise a culture that gives rise to the former. But then, that's just my view. Like a certain body part, everybody has one.

The problem with your analogy is that *Psych* doesn't have a main character named Psy, who people could confuse for Psych, James Roday has never been listed as playing Psych in the show's [credits](http://imgur.com/Cc2ELv8), no one in the show has ever thought his name was, or called him Pych, there aren't any episodes titled ""Psych and the...""

To me it's not that there's a problem with correcting his name, it's the way it happens. It always turns into a foaming at the mouth rage, trying to discredit whoever said it in a rabble jerkoff, that really seems to destroy any interesting discussion that would come from the material.

-Spend morning cooking and cleaning. The more stressed the better.

-Family/Friends arrive.

-All pitch in except elderly relatives and children who must be offered drinks and stored safely in the living room until dinner.

-If classified as adult, offer to help in kitchen, if you are male help will likely only be required for the movement of plates, cutlery and food. If help is outright refused, simply linger around for a minute or so before quietly drifting to the living room to discuss football/jobs.

-Be seated. Make sure to seat kids on a smaller table elsewhere (preferably upon spare camping furniture.)

-Pull crackers, place paper hats firmly upon head, await turn to offer terrible joke and then precede by consuming sickening amounts of turkey, pigs in blankets, stuffing and spuds (accompanied by a single brussel sprout for good measure). IMPORTANT: Consume copious amounts of alcohol throughout this period. 

-Board games. Make sure to assign to groups, men vs women vs kids/teens is a favourite. Recommended board games are charades, pictionary and trivial pursuit, which all significantly improve when slightly jarred. IMPORTANT: Again consume more alcohol through this period.

-Continue until all passed out or pissed off.

The truth is, teaching children in the UK about other languages is short sighted. Most people from the UK who visit other nations, do so for pleasure not business in the form of a holiday or vacation. 

Teaching every child French (for example) is of no use to almost all children. Who is to say this child will even visit France? There are too many other nations speaking too many different languages for children in the UK to ever benefit from learning a single other language. 

The people most likely to use another language are those who are highly educated, intelligent and or skilled. But they will be in business or trade with other people of similar attributes who have most likely learned English because it is the language of trade, diplomacy, science, business and the internet. 

If you need to learn another language then by all means do so, most likely as an adult or sometimes as a child. However forcing other languages upon our school children and producing UK documents in multiple languages is redundant.

You could argue they should provide the jacket (or at least argue you should be able to wear your own) as a HS issue depending on the temperature of your workplace - if you're working in a cold environment then warm clothing counts as PPE, which they legally must provide free of charge.  

Generally the guidance on minimum temperature in indoor workplaces (if it's reasonable practicable to achieve that which it may not be in a warehouse) is 16C or 13C if it involves strenuous work.  If it's below that then they really should provide warm clothing but there's no strict limit under which it applies, there's various factors involved.  

However they definitely can't make you work outside if it's freezing and say you can't wear a coat unless it's one of theirs that you paid for.

true,artmonkeyworld,null,null,"Hi, I'm the artist on this one and I thought I would just repost the explanation of their seating arrangements that I posted a few weeks ago to answer the majority of the questions that keep popping up.

I initially started wanting to have 3 characters in very specific positions, 4,9, and war.  I also knew I wanted to keep every figure in the exact same position as they original figures are.

I really always wanted the War Doctor in the middle. [Spoilers if you havent seen the episode](#s ""I painted this before the special aired but knew that from the episode “The Name Of The Doctor” what he did in the time war caused him to stop calling himself the Doctor. I took this a step further, rather than being just an atrocity so horrible he could no longer be the Doctor, he in fact sacrificed his name for the Universe and his other selves. He took an entire regeneration killed it and buried it in his head to save the universe and effectively allowed the others to go on being the Doctor.The title of the episode wasn’t about what the Doctors name was, or who was going to say it. That episode was about the revelation to the audience that his participation in the Time War was not in “The Name of the Doctor”.
Some might argue that committing 2 acts of genocide is hardly a sacrifice, but to a man who values life above all there is no greater, especially when he has to do it for the greater good. Now with the events of the Day of the Doctor, we know that he in fact saved Galifrey. That to me makes the sacrifice of his name, the disavowment of an entire regeneration  and some 400 or more years of regret and guilt all the more powerful."")

Hartnell  was placed where he was because I knew that people would say that he should be in the center, luckily  in the original there is a figure to the immediate right of center that is leaning in and pointing at the center figure. It was too easy to turn that into him pointing with his index finger as if to say, “I was number One. That should be my seat”

9 was placed were where most people think Judas is.(That position in reality goes to where 5 sits) But since most people take that position to belong to Judas as he is holding a knife I ran with it. Not to start a flame war but not returning for the 50th was just silly. And in fact he will now be remembered more for not doing it than if he had. It will always be a footnote on his career and a sour note for many fans. It’s his personal right, but as tenant put it a bit churlish.

Speaking on 10, I put him there as in the original image that figure is in the most visually dynamic pose. I thought that would speak well of 10’s personality and let me show off the suit.Plus the 3d glasses emphasis the 3d special that the 50th aired in.

Capaldi is where he is because with his addition I know had the 13 Doctors to do a proper last supper tribute. But no one knows what his outfit will look like. Luckily I was able to kill 2 birds with one stone by using  both of 11’s outfits.  Capaldi is in the Christmas outfit having just regenerated and is in the middle of taking it off. I imagine 11 is off to the side saying to the others,” Do you see this?! He is taking off the bow tie.”  

Beyond that everyone else was placed for mostly aesthetic reasons. And I always knew that I wanted 4 on the end because in the original image there is a very faint but visible pattern on the table cloth that comes down on each side. Its only on the two sides though, my immediate thought was to place 4 on the end so that his scarf could be easily seen, and wrap all the way down the table around each doctor, and fall off the table in the same two spots replicating the table cloth pattern.

This gave me a way to achieve the draped look of some of the positions of the original while letting me emphasize that they are in fact all the same man.

TLDR
ALWAYS bring a banana to a party.

We have so much work to do at the moment, so if your enquiry isn't to do with Christmas then please leave it until the new year.

We can't always guarantee that stock will be there in time. Appreciate this and find another company, this is a free market after all.

The couriers are out of our hands. We will do everything we can to get your presents to you before Christmas, but if they're late there's not much we can do about it. They hire outside drivers who won't know the routes as well and might not get round to you.

We do understand that if something does wrong that you'll be angry and frustrated, but please don't take it out on us. It will make us feel less inclined to help you.

Bottom line, be civil, understand that we have a lot to do at the moment and above all remember that we will do everything we can to help you.",0,1387304937,null,0,false,0,ce40kk0,t3_1t2qsb,t1_ce40kk0,t3_1t2qsb,null,1428093134,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
