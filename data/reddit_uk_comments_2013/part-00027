Walmart and many other companies will not allow any war to happen soon.  Too much at risk.  And this is very much the same in China.  The people in power don't want a war because of their business interests.

There are some jobs which will inevitably involve an element of personal risk: being a coastguard is one of them. If you choose to become a coastguard, you do so knowing that you will have to put yourself in dangerous situations, and that dead bodies will be a fairly regular feature in your work. Nobody becomes a coastguard thinking that it's all clean, indoors and no heavy lifting. Likewise, it's a basic fact that some parts of the country are popular with people who wish to kill themselves, and Beachy Head is one of them. If you apply to be a coastguard at Beach Head, you do so fully in the knowledge that part of your job will be retrieving the corpses of suicide victims. The people who choose to do that job do so completely willingly.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; Why are you so tied up on the present dude?

Because it doesn't matter whether Shelvey will be a leader 3 seasons from now, we need someone for next season - or even better, someone to start right now. We have a young squad that needs leaders and voices in it, but I don't think asking Shelvey to be that voice is a good idea, because his own game needs work first. How many other clubs have youngsters that aren't regular starters as leaders on the pitch? It doesn't happen.

As for who else in the squad? Agger already does it, but 3 people - Agger, Stevie &amp; Reina - isn't enough. I'm hoping Lucas steps up - he's been around long enough. He shows leadership &amp; support in quiet and less demonstrative ways, but now's the time for him to step up on the pitch and provide a calming voice, especially to help slow the tempo and keep control of the game when we have a lead - Alonso was brilliant in that regard, as was Mascherano. Lucas is now at a similar level in the team to what they were at their time here, so I'm hoping he can do it. It really needs to be a defensive player moreso than an attacking one at this point.

Beyond that, there isn't really anyone in the current squad for right now, and that's worrying. This is part of the reason why I think Skrtel will leave in the summer, partly because Rodgers doesn't think he has the character he's after (hence Carra taking his spot), and he'll try bring in a new CB who he thinks does offer that leadership.

China doesn't own the world.  For all of its industrial might, it remains an exploited country.  Chinese capitalism is constrained at every turn, from the rent paid for intellectual property, to the restrictions on importing raw materials (especially in the form of monopoly prices by Australian mining firms), to the investments wiped out by foreign military action (Iraq, Libya, now Mali, where next?).  The loans - which are unlikely to ever be paid back - are a further sign of Chinese weakness. That is your ""level playing field"".

Obama has launched a new economic policy: after smashing the conditions of American workers, he now calls for ""in-sourcing"" of work and building up the United States as a cheap labour platform, at a time when the world is already awash in consumer goods that people are struggling to afford.  At the same time, he has called for a 'pivot' to the Pacific, redeploying America's vast military machine to threaten China.  New bases are being developed in Australia and Japan.  The Japanese are being rearmed and their ""pacifist"" constitution amended.  The Phillipines and Vietnam have similarly been encouraged to press their territorial claims against China.

Do not  forget how much money China has - it goes into trillions of US dollars....

Sounds to me from what you have written that America is the country that is showing signs of weakness.  Trying to do this 'insourcing' is just a joke.  You think that will happen?  How can American suppliers possibly compete with China?
'Buy American'?  People won't buy into that bullshit.  They just won't cheap and China can provide cheap.

And Vietnam and the Phillipines flexing their muscles is no more to be worried about than when many different South American countries did the same to America in the 70's/80's.  No way jose.

China owns the world whether we like it or not.  I've been hearing about a possible 'China collapse' since 1999 and there has been no sign of that happening.

Right now there is a brand new complex just completed next door to where I live.  All the apartments will sell for no less than GBP 600k each.  No shortage of buyers.

China's economy is very very strong and despite what America thinks or does, they need China.  China sinks and the world goes into depression.

I've also sympathised with him as well and I'm at the same stage where I've had enough of him. As you said there isn't a good argument left for him to be our main striker but I don't think he played too badly yesterday. He did play better than he usually does and I actually thought, along with Azpi and Ramires, he was one of our better players  on the pitch.

I still think we need to experiment playing both Torres and Ba on the pitch at the same time, with Torres playing just behind Ba..... until we can hopefully pick up a better striker over the summer.

Given all that is not known of the Time War or what it took to create the time lock, it is quite possible that its creation by the Doctor took the assistance of many other like minded Time Lords with the same goal of banishing their race from the universe. Themselves included. And the Doctor was going to be the only Time Lord left as he was the one to activate it, which would kill him and cause him to regenerate into Chris Eccelston. Thus, maybe wanting to preserve the only remaining part of their race for as long as possible, maybe those Time Lord cohorts of the Doctor gave him all of their remaining regenerations. Thus it would be quite easy to give the Doctor as many regenerations as they want at this point. Give him a couple of dozen Time Lord followers in the Time War to have done this, and yes, he could have hundreds of regenerations.

I agree with every point you've made and seeing as I have lived in the Beeston/Chilwell area all my life (going back their during university holidays) it is amazing someone such as yourself who has not lived in Nottingham very long can pick up on the concerns I have also arrived at. Yes it is Broxtowe Council and yes the square plans appear so generic that I fear my town is going to run into the ground. I too have found it an outrage that the area does not play up on its unique assets, such as Robin Hood, the best pub in the East Midlands (the Crown) and also the ventures of independent businesses which is starting to take shape along the High Road of Beeston (and going into Chilwell) including Bartons, what was once the largest independent bus company in Europe and is still functioning albeit in an adapted form. I know there are comedy/music/etc nights at Bartons and these are bringing people back into the local community. My fear is that the tram is a matter of allowing people to increase the distance of their journey by going into town, rather than maintaining the spirit of the local area and local economy, which appears to be of no real interest, merely getting people into the city centre (which isn't what everyone would want anyway).

He can turn little resources into relative success, but he has no experience at the top of the game, where city need to be concerned. Quite frankly the only manager I would regard as an improvement over Mancini would be Mourinho (and maybe Guardiola depending on how well he proves able to do at a club that's not Barcelona). The problem with Mourinho is that he moves around to much, he's no the sort of manager you can create a dynasty with. He has signaled his desire to settle down at one club, but even if he does come to city, who knows if he'll decide to stay here, and not some other club.

Pep would likely be more in it for the long haul, but hes just signed for Bayern, meaning he isn't going anywhere soon, and again, we don't know how he will do at a team that's not Barcelona.

true,glynxpttle,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt;Oliver Hogan, the CEBR economist who wrote the report, said: “The evidence seems to suggest sensible drinkers are cutting back but problem drinkers are relatively undeterred by cost.” 

This is the problem right here. Alcohol is an addictive drug, raising prices will do nothing to the addicted, which I would suggest would be the main people damaged enough by alcohol to require hospital treatment.

I think there is also some doubt about hospital figures reflecting actual damage caused by alcohol. For example a couple of years ago I passed out while in a pub and got taken to hospital, this turned out to be caused by a lung problem, unrelated to alcohol (I'd only had one drink at the time). I believe its possible that this would be included as an alcohol related incident simply because I was in a pub.

As far as public drunkenness goes I would suggest they reduce taxes substantially on beers around 3.6% (the so called session beers) in order to encourage people to drink at this strength instead of the 5% plus strength beers and shorts - in some cases I think its the speed of alcohol introduced into the body which has a negative effect on some people (anecdotally a friend of mine was like this, he was fine going out when drinking weaker beer, but when he started on the 5% stuff he used to get really belligerent - in his case he eventually recognised the problem himself and decided to give up drinking completely).",0,1360508972,null,0,false,0,c8cns7d,t3_188vbb,t1_c8cns7d,t3_188vbb,null,1431249343,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,friesahoy,null,null,"&gt;We don't talk about 'cowmeat', 'pigmeat', and 'sheepmeat'. It's interesting that we've not got a 'nicer' name for horsemeat...

I have a theory about that. Basically, we don't have a word for the meat because we don't eat the animal. However, there's a little more to it. 

In English we have a word for the animal, and a word for the meat from the animal. This is largely due to the Norman invasion. The King, Lords, and court all spoke French, and the people spoke English. Basically, we use (Old) English derived names for the animals that the peasants tended, and French derived words for the meat. 

There are probably exceptions, but we have cows  from which we get beef. The French for beef is ""boef"", IIRC. Similarly, the French for sheep is ""moutton"", which is rather like 'mutton', but nothing like 'sheep'. 

So, the reason we don't have another word for ""horsemeat"" is that we didn't eat them. At least, not by choice. They were far more useful as transport around the time the language was being influenced by the French invasion.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There is a large wall of text there and many valid points to boot. However, to provide some balance, there are those who would argue that more good can be accomplished by supporting local industry as that then relieves the state of some financial burden. That scraping of additional funds can then either be used in paying other services, reducing debts, but more crucially, sent overseas as charity and aid. 

That is one of the most appealing concepts to many of the nationalists who would like to see their neighbours out of unemployment and into a stable job which sees wealth brought back into some impoverished areas. The bond between percieved wealth and patronage often seem to be linked. How much good a charity worker building homeless shelters and digging wells will do compared to providing small incomes that only succeed in feeding their families in the parts of the world where labourers produce these items of clothing is clearly up for debate, yet one thing remains clear. 

The workers in the Third World often recieve so little that they have enough to provide for their families only the barest essentials, if that, and nothing left over to pool together into enough money for goods or infrastructural projects which could improve their environment beyond what little they have. On the other hand, a region which relies wholly upon benefits will only continue to degrade until it becomes little better than say Detroit or parts of Mexico City, where the remains of golden years has given way to decay due to the departure of continued or stabilised growth. 

It is the desire to fight back and prevent the downward spiral into this unpleasant conclusion that is spurning people to rebuild jobs in Britain, and if it means getting the machinations of charity back into gear so that in-time, people in the third world can break free of the mould of subsistence and get a better lot in life, then I have no problem with it.",0,1360512540,null,0,false,0,c8cohav,t3_188qhg,t1_c8cohav,t1_c8cnjb8,null,1431249672,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; Alcohol is an addictive drug, raising prices will do nothing to the addicted, which I would suggest would be the main people damaged enough by alcohol to require hospital treatment.

Alcohol is not physiologically addictive, it's only addictive by habit*. And people can only form those habits by drinking a large amount over a long period of time. Clearly that's affected by cost. Also, a lot of socially problematic drinkers are not the 'sad lonely drunks' who are genuinely addicted, but groups of people out together, often drinking a lot before going out. Clearly if topping up is made more expensive, the groups are likely to drink less before going on, and therefore drink less overall, which improves outcomes, or even over the long-term find other forms of entertainment.

It's not a bad idea to tax 5% proof beers heavily, and reduce taxes on 3.5% beers, but that is far more invasive than what's proposed. Under the government proposals a pint of 4% beer would have to cost no less than about 80p.

But I am very biased because I grew up in the 80's watching it on PBS, and I prefer it to everything since the reboot (especially since Moffat, although I like Matt Smith more than Tennant).  Yes, the pace is slower and it can get boring, but you will get used to it if you decide to commit.  There are literally decades of character development and backstory there, much of which is drawn upon or alluded to in the reboot series.  The reboot has much greater production values, but can't touch the writing of the Classic series.

It can be overwhelming due to the quantity of stories, so sampling the best stories is probably the best way to get into Classic Who.  Also, viewing them with a ""film historian"" mindset helps also.  And don't try to marathon too much.

BTW, The Time Monster is  Roger Delgado's second to last performance as the Master, as he was killed in a car accident 1 year later.

For Wales to put the misery and frustration of the last eight games behind them, the win was a massive confidence booster. I am the first to admit the game was not the best and the rugby was not the prettiest, but I think both teams played into the outcome. Both teams played rugby that was full of errors and lacking inspiration, but Wales had something a little extra in the tank to go on and score the try.

This will be a ghettoisation of the poor which I do agree is a bad thing.

However, I can find no evidence that housing families in wealthy areas has any significant impact on the long term prospects of the family and gut instinct would lead you to believe it would be isolating as they would share a very different social background to those living there by their own means.

I don't have a solution (other than massive investment in the North of England and relocating people there along with educational schemes to get them into the subsidised jobs created there).

I love these little anecdotes when they come from people that grew up down the road from Anfield and are raised alongside the club. But for those of us who adopted LFC from across an ocean, we have no tale of fandom that can compare to growing up with the club, so why bother trying really hard to appear like you care? Watch the games, follow the team, lose sleep about a loss or a shitty draw, and in 20 years when you don't have to say how important the club is to you, maybe then you'll have a story worth telling.

I say all of this as a shitty plastic American. I may be able to talk with anyone about the club tactically and about the modern issues surrounding it, but I don't know anything about what it really means to be a part of the club.

Ok, Snodgrass could have been more accurate from the set pieces he had, Becchio was in a slightly awkward position being in the loan striker role so early in his city tenure, and, indeed, the crucial goal eluded us. But Hoolahan and Snodgrass were superb together, and Becchio sounded like he was making all the right noises, jostling for possession, winning the odd free kick etc. Kamara too, sounds like he could really be a handful. This combined with our drive in the last quarter of the match was all very positive. They have returned to the style of play that kept them loss free for ten matches (in my humble opinion) and if Holt returns soon, Ruddy gets back between the sticks and our new signings are deployed well by Houghton, I see us being OK.

I'd say the main reason he splits opinions is because a lot of what he does goes unnoticed either due to it being a positional thing that only fans at the ground see, or being a cog in the passing machine but too early on in the move to gain much attention

He doesn't really possess the vision or technique to split a defence with a pass, nor does he have the legs or ability to run through on a dribble and take the game to the opposition, failings which become more apparent with our current system that really needs two midfielders who are more complete. In a 4-3-3 there was less pressure on him and I felt he was always more comfortable there. He's a better player now than 3 years ago but the position he's playing is less suited to his skill set.

true,WarOnHugs,null,null,"He has become a very solid defensive midfielder, I think last season's CL campaign is proof of that. He was excellent when we were up against it vs. Bayern and Barca. However Mikel's distribution is what often lets him down. If you look at the truly world class players in his position, like Busquets, Schweinsteiger or Xabi Alonso they know where to pass the ball before they even receive it and do so in 1 or 2 touches. Mikel can be prone to playing negatively (passing sideways or backwards) and slowly. I think the modern defensive midfielder should be able to contribute to attacking play - especially against weaker sides - which Mikel doesn't do well or often enough.

So unfortunately he hasn't quite fulfilled the potential he first showed at the U20 World Cup in 2005, where he rivalled even Messi. But I am very pleased to have him, at 25 he is already massively experienced and generally reliable if unspectacular. But with players like De Bruyne and Chalobah coming through, or links to Fellaini he may not be a sure starter in the near future.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I think these sorts of things should exist where there is racially-based disadvantage within the particular group. It's true that the black community or the Asian community are objectively meaningless in terms of someone's origin, it is inherently racist to suggest there is some essential link between a fourth generation immigrant from Jamaica, a first generation economic migrant doctor from Kenya, or an asylum seeker from DRC. Those people are inherently as similar as someone from Bristol and someone from Moscow, i.e. not at all. But the meaning of the groups has been created by historic racism; black people living in the country became a much more tightly bound group by the fact that they were placed under common conditions of racial disadvantage. Under those conditions, it's very appropriate to try to encourage, for instance, black kids to join the Metropolitan police, who previously at least were demonstrably racist, or black kids to go to university. It is a compensatory action for past disadvantage, and necessarily must use the same categories as were used to enforce that disadvantage. Over time, as the populations converge, the meaning of these distinctions will fade. A kid from a Nigerian background might still have an ongoing investment or interest in that cultural identity, but they won't think of themselves as culturally black, black will become purely a physical description of skin colour.

I think it's dubious for them to exist where groups are economically successful and well-integrated, as arguably you could say about people from South-East Asia, or the Indian subcontinent.

Take me as an example. At the age of 20 (a few years ago) I was a student. I was diagnosed with cancer and was being treated at Charring Cross Hospital in London. I had to take a break in studies, while I had chemo, chemo requires a morning every now and then in hospital and most days at home. I had spent all my money paying tuition fees and my family had nothing. So I had to apply for befits to get me through. At the time I filled in lots of forms took ages and at the end of that process I was told I could not claim JSA as a student ( I think this is incorrect, I think I ticked one of the boxes wrong), I was however able to claim housing allowance. I was staying in a student house share, my payment was £480/month. Someone from the counsel visited the house and said my accommodation was worth £400/month so that was all I'd be allowed. Yet the landlord still had to be paid the full amount. I had to find £80/month + food for 6 months. In then end the university gave me a £500 hardship loan (which I repaid), Macmillan Cancer Support gave me another £200 (because they are awesome), and my student friends gave me food (Not that they know how much food they gave me).

The advantages as far as I can see.

* Great for evidence gathering
* Greatly increase the accuracy of evidence
* Require much less statement writing
* Later identification of suspects
* Work wonderfully (as is the case of CCTV) for ending spurious complaints.

The Disadvantages. 

* Something for suspects, drunks et al to whinge about ""I know my rights, you can't film me."" 
* Can't be used in some scenarios 
* Its an expensive bit of kit and I'm not convinced how robust these things really are. The most modern bit of truly bobby proof kit I've ever seen is the 2D maglite.  
* I already carry a lot of kit. Mind you I have seen at least one method of attaching these things to body armour which looks like it would be of minimal inconvenience. 
* Mounting options in some scenarios would be very limited as well. 

I think the advantages do outweigh the negatives and I think as with anything as things progress and feedback is given and designs improved on it could be very workable although data retention could be an issue. Having to change SD cards / batteries, people are going to forget. Whether in these times of austerity forces choose to spend money on these devices or not remains to be seen.

true,Bloop2012,null,null,"Bank accounts and utility accounts are not owned or operated by the federal government, but they are both regulated by the federal government and both types of accounts require a SSN or a Taxpayer ID Number to acquire, so it's not too difficult to imagine that in the age of warrentless wiretapping that the government could easily pull up these records as well.

And as for your comment about owning something being a crime.. your taking my comment out of context. No owning a firearm is not a crime, but saying that licensing citizens to own firearms is an invasion of privacy is laughable. We license drivers because while driving you are basically a 2,000 lb. guided ballistic projectile. It takes a certain level of skill and competence to drive, and even then people fuck that up. It boggles my mind that jackasses think that keeping a gun a secret is more important than ensuring firearms (which are designed first and foremost to kill) are purchased by persons who have demonstrated a requisite level of skill to safely handle said firearm.

Claiming that licensing violates your privacy is a joke, anything the government wants to know about you, they already have avenues to do so. If you think you have much of anything in your life that is an iron clad secret from the government, then you are sorely mistaken. If you are suspect, then everything from wiretapping to parabolic microphones directed at your bedroom window will be used. GPS trackers hidden on your vehicle make mobile surveillance so much easier to do without being detected. So, the fact that you have a Colt .45 in your closet is not much of a secret. In fact, if you own a firearm that you are so damned determined to keep a secret, it only makes me think you want to do something illegal with it anyway.

I'm all for having guns available to citizens for self defense, hunting, and sporting uses. But if you need a secret stockpile of guns, then your one step away from joining a radical militia or being an end of the world nut.",0,1360551388,null,0,false,0,c8czz9i,t3_176jug,t1_c8czz9i,t1_c8cza7g,null,1431255227,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Rees and Burrell are ok, the only catered options if that's what they want to go for. Couldn't tell you which ones better as i've only been to one of the briefly. Not too far the the City Centre and University but not as close as the Guildhall accommodation.

Of the Guildhall accommodation Batson is probably the worse, it has shared bathrooms/showers but it is also the cheapest of the Guildhall Halls, flats are also male/female only, but doesn't really matter seeming flats in a block will all know each other.

The other three Guildhall accommodations, Trafalgar, Margret Rule and James Watson are all the same room/flat wise. They pretty much are cookie cutter student accommodation layout wise.

Margret Rule is closer too the city center (pretty much in it), but is right next to the train station so you can hear all the announcements in some parts of the building

James Watson is closer too the University and a little further from the city center, but it's only a 5 minute walk between James Watson and Margret Rule.

Trafalgar is between the two but again it doesn't really matter.

The three above are your best bet by far in terms of quality and location, but they are the most expensive accommodation. The Guildhall Halls are in best places overall, with Rees and Burrell after that, but as i said he really wants to steer clear of Langstone.

Best bet is visit an open day and get a gist of where they are and what they are like.

true,goofuth,flair3,,"Not sure if you were referring to Son or Szalai, but anyways: Son has enough pace and technique to play on the wings but also has a pretty good eye for goal and a shot to go with it. Like Sparklesnap said, he's not a guy that will hold the ball up front or create mounds of space with his body but I definitely think he's talented enough to play in the premier league in the near future either as a forward or winger. That said, I think he'd benefit greatly from another year or two with HSV where he'll get regular time on the pitch. He's only 20 and has already notched 9 goals this season in a top league so he's definitely showing rapid improvement.


Sports Seoul reported that a Spurs scout was at the Korea - Croatia friendly this week to see Son and was reportedly quoted as saying that they'd be ""keeping an eye on him."" HSV's price tag for Son is rumored to be 10 million pounds but he could probably be had for a little less than that this summer (unless he keeps his recent form and continues to impress).


Also, his name is Heung-Min Son/Son Heung-Min (Son being his surname)

But what Perez and many Chelsea fans don't seem to understand is that you can't have a team full of attacking players, football is a 2-way game.   
  
Mikel is the metronome in midfield, he always makes smart passes, rarely gives up possession, tackles well and he knows when to make smart fouls to slow the other team down and despite being relied on to do so he hasn't been sent off in 5 years. He's a smart player and only getting better every year. At 25 he has been an integral part of 4 FA cup and a league winning team, as well as being one of the best players on a champions league winning team and just led his country to victory in the ACN, how many players can claim that at his age? he is IMO the most important midfielders for our team defensively and would make the starting XI every game for me in this current squad, just look at how much he's been missed this past month to understand how important he is.

2. How much you need depends on where and when you're going. If you'll be travelling off-peak only (after 9:30am) you'll need a *maximum* of:
* Zone 1 = £7 per card per day
* Zones 1 &amp; 2 = £7 per card per day
* Zones 1 - 3 or 1 - 4 = £7.70 per card per day

Or if you need to do peak-time travel:
* Zone 1 = £8.40 per card per day
* Zones 1 &amp; 2 = £8.40 per card per day
* Zones 1 - 3 or 1 - 4 = £10.60 per card per day

Note that these are maximum price caps -- you might well spend less than this on a day's travel, but no matter how much you use the tubes, trains, buses or trams, you'll never be charged more than this for a day's travel in those zones.

If that doesn't cover your requirements there are full fare details at http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/14416.aspx

3. Simply touch the oyster card on the yellow reader by the driver. Everyone else will be doing it too, don't worry!

4. The cards are not zoned, but the way you get charged IS zoned.

A couple of other things:

* Oyster cards ARE tube tickets. You really don't want to be faffing around with the old-style paper tickets, they're much more expensive than oysters and not nearly as convenient.
* You know how with the pre-chip-and-pin mag-stripe credit cards you used to swipe them across the reader. Don't do that! Oyster cards are TOUCH cards, not swipe cards. Simple hold the card on the reader for half a second and you'll get a happy little beep, the people who have trouble with Oyster are those who keep waving them back &amp; forward over the readers!

This helps establish quick counter attacks, because even though his passes go sideways or backwards they are often controlled, which means that the receiving player can actually do something with the ball. He's also a great option for us when we need to get into assured possession, as he's always able to hold the ball and release it to someones feet.

Despite having a reputation as a crunching tackler, he really isn't the most mobile over the first five yards which means that he often has trouble tackling the quicker players. A lot of people will disagree with me, but I think he is a good reader of the game and often makes crucial interceptions or kills passing lanes to the opponents creation department.

With Nigeria he seems to spread the ball to the wings in a much more direct fashion than he's been asked to at Chelsea.

I may not be accomplished in the perspective of my peers, nor may I be socially well thought of, but I am very much a proponent of keeping Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Observing young Catholic girls walking through my predominantly Protestant neighbourhood is patently offensive to me. As my aforementioned neighbourhood is an affordable housing zone, their presence here suggests that they have access to one of the Government-subsidized living units. I find this both outrageous and unacceptable. These young women were deliberately provoking my provincial sensibilities by wearing the uniform of a nearby Catholic primary school (ages 5-11). As they attend such school, I can correctly presume that their parents who rent the living unit are ethnically Irish and in full support of a United Ireland and the militantly political group IRA/Sinn Fein.


Forthwith, their ability to secure a living unit in this neighbourhood has denied that very luxury to acquaintances of mine who are in dire need of such subsidized accommodations. This is most objectionable as my acquaintances have been living in this neighborhood for a much longer period of time, albeit in the same subsidized living unit as their parents. Now that they have had offspring and wish to live apart from their parents, but have no disposable funds to purchase or rent a market value house, there are no longer any subsidized units available. The housing council has advised my acquaintances that if they wish to live in a subsidized unit, they must do so in a different neighbourhood within the city limits of Lisburn.


I am having difficulty articulating myself due to the emotional nature of this discussion, which I also find quite comedic, however I must be frank. Whilst I have no working knowledge of the housing council, I charge them of clandestinely placing Catholic families in my neighbourhood to undermine the pro-United Kingdom sentiments of existing residents such as myself. Indeed, this unfounded subversive maneuver of accommodation discrimination is what led to previously Protestant strongholds such as the Knockmore housing estate and the Pond Park residential area becoming infiltrated by non-Protestants. Furthermore, I challenge that this dastardly act is by design to keep pro-United Kingdom residents apart and that the influx of Catholic families is eerily similar to the spreading of a dangerous virus on a molecular level.""

As buried_treasure said, the fares are capped so you shouldn't need more than £7 per day (plus the £5 deposit.)

To use it on the bus, place the card flat against the yellow reader and wait for a green light and a single, long beep. It's exactly the same on the train/tube/DLR, except you touch in at the start AND out at the end (if there are no gates, the readers will be on free standing cabinets.) The bus fare is flat, but tube fares are charged by zones travelled through: if you don't touch out, it'll assume you've made the most expensive journey possible from that station and charge the maximum fare.

The cards are valid almost anywhere **IN ZONES 1-9**. I say this because there's always someone who gets off the train at Gatwick, Woking or even (!) Portsmouth, tries to open the (incompatible) gates with their Oyster, and invariably gets charged (a) a penalty fare for travelling without a valid ticket, (b) the maximum fare on the Oyster for not touching out.

TL;dr: valid anywhere in London only, one card per person, look for the green light and listen for the beep.

Also, Londoner tip: the Oyster comes in its own wallet. KEEP IT IN A SEPARATE POCKET.

In the opening stages, Mali weren’t good enough at pressuring Mikel when he received possession. Their two holding midfielders, Mohamed Traore and Momo Sissoko, took turns at playing to the left and to the right of the duo, but Traore was much more effective at pushing forward to press Mikel – Sissoko had a disappointing game, and stood off when he was towards that side of the pitch.""

It's nothing to do with wanting to only do business with your racial or cultural group. Nothing. A business will take any custom, simple as. That's how businesses work. Make money. Sell as much of whatever it is they sell as possible. 

The real reason why this directory exists is so advertisers can pitch to a captive audience. (South-, at least in the UK) Asians are quite proud people and will take any chance to big-up their business, make it seem prestigious/successful and will be happy to be included in a directory that is a fantastic chance for 3rd party businesses to advertise to one of the most successful and entrepreneurial groups in the country. 


That aside, and this is a bit of a by-point anyway, in big cities with large communities of whichever subjection of ""brown"" you are, a lot of businesses owned by Asians can tend to employ other Asians and mostly do business with other Asians, especially if it is a non-professional business you're running (like a factory or grocery store). Even my uncle's solicitors firm deals 99% with other Asians. 

Why? Because communities are strong, local businesses usually cater to the local population and work of mouth and recommendation is an extremely strong factor in people's consumer choices. Need your boiler fixed? My uncles a plumber. Need to buy flights to visit family in Bombay? Mr Patel from 4 doors down runs a travel agent.

This is generally the case for the vast majority of lecturers in British universities. Most lecturers would far rather be doing research with their postgrad students than teaching undergraduates, but it's a requirement of the job to do the boring stuff as well as the interesting stuff, so they do it. But very few universities employ their academic staff on the basis of their teaching ability, and generally there's no requirement to have had any training in how to teach to become a lecturer.

Of course there will be businesses in cities with large minority populations catering and employing people from one particular sub-section of society.

How many white people do you think work at the Chinese supermarket on the main road? How many Afro-Caribbean people do you think work at the Polski Sklep? Whilst I’m at it, how many non-“alternative”/rockers do you think work at the tattoo and piercing shop in town? I wouldn’t work in a knickers and bra shop because the only thing I know about them is how to get them off (giggidy).

A factory making jumpers in somewhere like Smallheath in Birmingham will employ 99% other Punjabi’s, for instance, because the owner is Punjabi and his family and mates all get their sisters and daughters jobs there. My uncle deals 99% with Asian people because his firm is based in a predominantly Asian area where not only is it mostly Asian people buying and selling property in the area, but also he deals with immigration matters (which for linguistic and familiarity purposes) mostly serve South Asian immigrants. It’s not that he’s failed to assimilate with the majority population AT ALL. His wife is white British, and his son (my cousin) Freddie is mixed race. He has LITERALLY mixed with the majority white population of the UK.

It’s absolute bullshit for you to say that the fact he almost entirely has Asian clients stifles his business. He’s not thick. He’s not sitting around going “oh I’m so depressed my business is struggling still at least I refuse to do service with any white people, that I hate”. Nobody does that. Business people are motivated by expanding their companies and making £££. 

You’ve obviously got a chip on your shoulder about something. But I find it really confusing it’s about British Asians. I can’t speak much for other immigrant groups, but as a whole Indians/Pakistanis/Bangladeshis/Sri Lankans have pretty much the highest rates of education and are vastly VASTLY over-represented in high-flying, professional roles including in the NHS, law, education, finance and technology. This is exactly the OPPOSITE of what you’re suggesting. Don’t make out like we are living in some sort of self-imposed ghetto. Out of my generation of extended only 2 or 3 out of the 10+ cousins and siblings that are married are NOT married to White (for lack of better word) people, including me having a white Dutch step-cousin and shitloads of white British brother-/sister-in-laws.

true,quicksilverjack,cnty-scotland,No Mean City,"Our inheritance tax system isn't that ""unfair"", you should see France's which is 60% on estates over £30,000 IIRC. 

3 points. 

1. If you transfer your whole estate to your spouse or civil partner on death you pay no IHT.   
2. When your surviving partner dies they get to use your ""unused"" IHT allowance in conjunction with their own. Meaning no tax to pay on at least £650,000*.  
3. Do you have an estate worth over £650,000? .... No? ...... didn't think so.   

Oh you do? Talk to your solicitor or financial advisor about inheritance tax planning.   
  
  
  
  
  
*The ""transferable nil rate band"" (the current nil rate band is £325,000) is based on a percentage. So if none of it is used the surviving partner gets to use 100%, if 65% of it is used they get to use 45%. The actual cash amount is determined by the nil rate band at the surviving partners date of death.  

So if Andy dies and leaves his whole estate to his civil partner Brian when Brian dies his executor can arrange for his estate to only pay tax on 2x the current nil rate band, even if the nil rate band in force when Andy died was lower.   
Andy dies -- NRB = £150,000   
Brian dies -- NRB = £500,000 -- Brians estate pays no tax unless it goes over £1,000,000",0,1360577293,null,0,1360579485,0,c8d5uoy,t3_18atlw,t1_c8d5uoy,t3_18atlw,null,1431258064,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

------------------------------
1. Piracy of Any Sort
2. Any and All Memes and Meme-Like content

    i.e. Caption Photos
    i.e. Advice Animals or any variation of Advice Animals
    i.e. Most animated GIFs

4. Common Items That Don't Directly Relate to Doctor Who

    i.e. Cracks, Statues/Angels, ""Bad Wolf"" Graffiti, ""Atmos"" Brands, Tally Marks, Bow Ties
    i.e. Bumper Stickers, License Plates, CAPTCHAs, etc.

12. Finally - Anything That Can Not Be Tied Directly to Doctor Who

------------------------------
1. It isn't pirated. in any sense of the definition.
2. It is a gif, I will grant you, but this states MOST gifs if it directly relates to a meme, and it is in no way a meme and therefor should not be categorized under this guideline.
4. It is none of these things, and DOES directly relate to doctor who (has almost an entire episode dedicated to it and it's painter).
12. I will reiterate. It DOES DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE SHOW.

All the more reason for the local councillors to have drawn up a decent contract rather than pushing around different artist's impressions - the one thing this city lead the world in.

The second half was a bit patchy but certainly not the worst, there were some a fair few good moments where it got pretty loud. The ending was brilliant, the singing right after Frank scored were deafening, it's great to hear the whole ground bellow it out like that. I've been up to quite a few other grounds as an away fan and it was still easily better than most other grounds I went to, and we always seem to lose away matches I go to so that's saying something. Also the fact that I was at the Shed, where often you can't hear the Matthew Harding, might've affected it. Fans in the Shed usually react to away fans singing, but the Wigan fans didn't do anything all match so there wasn't much in that.

A win is a win, and it's not like you can expect 90 mins of raucous chanting, the most important thing is what goes on on the pitch, it's just something you notices when there. It was still a great match with good moments on and off the pitch. The atmosphere at the ground is still a big reason to turn up, and I'd also advise an away match for those who haven't been on any, they can be great fun.

Ferreira, Carvalho, Deco and Ballack all lost Euro Finals, and Ballack also lost a World Cup Final (which he was suspended for, the poor bastard). Malouda, Makelele and William Gallas Iscariot lost the 2006 World Cup Final.

Mostly he was pointing at local corruption, but at least one of those was because of a picture of one of said councillors posing with a RPG on the Afghan border. :)

It wasn't a bad start, and I was prepared to cut him some slack because of it. 

Since then the only thing I can point to him doing is make stupid comments about rape which have led to civil war within his own party. This has caused him immense damage. 

There's two ways of looking at Galloway here. Either he's doing something for Bradford, or he's doing something for the people. On the latter point he made great progress in getting Asian women involved in politics. He didn't want it to be about conservative Asian men deciding who the family was going to vote for. He sent women supporters out to do the canvassing, and he made sure it happened when the men were less likely to be home. He made a lot of progress this way and there's a reasonable current of opinion that says Asian women are the people who voted him in. 

...and then he started talking about some instances of rape being little more than ""bad sexual etiquette"". His party leadership (Salma Yaqoob - who was more the party than he was) resigned, I saw at least one protest by Asian women of all ages (fuck yes, that was amazing!) and the scruffy white herberts who were pro-George at the tlection are now vehemently against as far as I can tell. 

My personal George journey is this:

1) Something of a fan, due to some of his leftism, whilst not liking him personally

2) Announces candidacy and I think ""oh shit""

3) I see how he's campaigning and I'm prepared to give him a chance

4) He gets in, wave of resignations amongst some of the more corrupt elements of local politics, and I think he's a voice for good.

5) Silence. Lots of it. The commentors on the local rag, best kept at arms length in case misanthropy turns out to be contagious, start saying ""Where's George?"" 

6) My Rugby League team, Bradford Bulls, goes bust. He starts talking about getting some friendly sheik to buy the club. He couldn't have convinced me of his insanity any more if he'd been found bollock naked halfway up the clock tower of city hall. 

7) In his urge to speak well of Julian Assange he let his opinion on rape come falling out of his mouth with its trousers round its ankles.

My main concern is how much nicotine (if any) can be inhaled via passive vaping.

Seems it's being looked into anyway.

&gt; The consumption of e-cigarettes causes emissions of aerosols and VOCs, such as 1,2-propanediol, flavoring substances, and nicotine, into indoor air. During inhalation of e-cigarette vapor, the aerosol size distribution alters in the human lung and leads to an exhalation of smaller particles. This effect is caused by the evaporation of the liquid particles in the lung and also in the environment after exhalation. The quantity of the inhaled vapor could be observed to depend on the ‘liquid’ delivery system of the e-cigarette in use.

&gt;Overall, the e-cigarette is a new source of VOCs and ultrafine/fine particles in the indoor environment. Therefore, the question of ‘passive vaping’ can be answered in the affirmative. However, with regard to a health-related evaluation of e-cigarette consumption, the impact of vapor inhalation into the human lung should be of primary concern.",0,1360585240,null,0,false,0,c8d6po8,t3_18alka,t1_c8d6po8,t1_c8d6jk0,null,1431258469,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

____

Get rid of stam. Get Koné back on. Hope that Boyce is back soon, same for Alcaraz (just in case we need him). Make substitutions near the end of matches, when there's 15-20 minutes to go, rather than about 3. Henriquez &amp; Miyaichi(when he's not injured...) should be given a chance at the end of the game (if not sooner).

Tell Ali that he keeps spilling balls straight to the feet of the opposing team... and if he keeps doing it, think about even giving Robles a go (although I know Ali still makes some fantastic saves, so it's not easy to say). 

Get people in the box. Everyone seems to be frightened of getting in there.

Keep running in the box, don't just stop and hope that the ball comes to you (looking at Stam after this weekend) - same when someone's taken a shot, don't just stop, try to get on the rebound.

Counter attacks need to be quicker sometimes -- get up the pitch faster!-- We get the ball out of the defence and then someone ends up holding it up in midfield and the other team has plenty of time to get behind the ball... we usually end up passing it backwards.

Tell Espinoza that it's great when those little flicks come off, but there have been far too many that haven't.

On the occasion that we actually take the ball up the right, Stam usually ends up crossing it to the guy sat in the second row... on the other side of the pitch... unless he's trying to switch to the left wing, because then he'll make a decent cross ...to the opposition.

If we can get someone who can actually play on the right side, use them. We're basically just trying the same thing from the left wing every game.

true,AnalyticContinuation,null,null,"It's a combination of the ""house edge"" and the turnround time. The ""house edge"" is the average percentage that the house takes from you on each bet. So if it is (say) 10% then for every bet you will get 90% back on average. In practice of course sometimes you win and sometimes you lose but if you made 100 bets of £1 you would expect to have about £90 at the end of it with a 10% house edge. (Then you make 90 £1 bets and now you have £81. And so on.)

(Incidentally the National Lottery house edge is 80%. That's **EIGHTY** percent. If you bet £1 one hundred times you will end up with £20.)

So with a bet on a horse, you have to wait about 30 minutes for the result. It is a bit tricky to compute house edge for the horses because it is not fixed and partly because it cannot be guaranteed it is set quite high. A high house edge means that the bookmaker takes money off you faster. But because of this there is some pain associated with the process which can slow down the rate or amount you gamble.

Now with gaming machines the house edge is set very small - perhaps 1-2%. So you will experience long sequences where you are ahead. The trouble is that when you play a game with a very small house edge the game becomes **extremely addictive**. The brain really loves small randomly occurring pleasurable stimuli (winning) and because the machines take the money off you so subtly you can easily convince yourself that you can win back any losses. Of course the maths is against you. But very few people playing these machines can do the statistics necessary to realise they will never win. Now combine that with the fast turnround, and in practice the machines give you lots of small pleasurable bursts on the way down, but still manage to clean you out completely, because you keep feeding your remaining stake back into the machine until you have nothing left.

It is the extremely addictive nature of these machines which is so dangerous. The article calls them ""the crack cocaine of gambling"" and that is right. There is a strong argument that laws should increase the minimum house edge allowed. Although this seems counter-intuitive (house takes more off you each bet) it would reduce the addictive nature of the games. And note that although the edge is so slender, the bookie still ends up with **all** the gambler's money in the end.",0,1360591668,null,0,false,0,c8d7o6x,t3_18ap5h,t1_c8d7o6x,t1_c8d5hcs,null,1431258923,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

To those that hate guns/gun-owners; please don't, we come in peace!

Not everywhere is like the USA.  Many countries have a large number of privately owned firearms and have hardly any gun-related crime (relatively speaking).  America is it's own little thing, what happens there does not translate to every other country.

It's fun to shoot, it's cool to own your own firearms (safely) and to be responsible about it.

I'm sure I read somewhere that excluding the US, worldwide gun owners are far less likely to commit crimes and far safer individuals overall.  This is not to say that accidents don't happen and that fate can't be tempted, but you have to look at larger trends.  Most gun owners are very proud of their ownership and the fun they can have with their sport, the price to pay for this is that you have to be a very good citizen.  If you mess up in any way and the Police have to come slap your hand then you may just lose the right to own firearms and that my friends is the biggest deterrent of all to us.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Yeah exposing your sex organs in exchange for money is perfectly legitimate and on moral equivalence of a doctor.

Plenty of people have done the above when it's not even their main profession - almost as if it was indeed a legitimate way to earn money...and some people (whisper it) do it just for fun with no money involved at all, such as on this website, and go quite a bit further than showing the top half of their 'sex organs'. But I'm sure given enough time you can tar an even wider cross-section with the same brush.

&gt;so little stigma attached i am sure people openly divulge their profession and it carries with it no negative connotations what so ever.

You're suggesting this isn't the case? Gail McKenna is a good starter - Page 3, going on to become a Sports and Children's TV presenter; I guess none of the people interviewing her bothered to contact you when it mattered. But then, you might not have heard of her as she's from after the 18th century; shall we list some other successful people who have been paid to display their physique (sorry, 'sex organs') and haven't suffered any 'negative connotations what so ever'? It may take a while.

&gt;also prostitutes are no different from professional athletes they both use their body for the purposes of entertainment for others. 

Oh crikey, now they're prostitutes. Any other dreadfully outdated attitudes you'd like to share, or are you still busy on a Jack Ryan crusade to force everything to be black and white, like in the movies?

&gt;You are a genius....

I wouldn't say so - I just don't subscribe to Pakistan-levels of simultaneous morality/ hypocrisy.

I'm merely asking why, given the extreme over-achieving success of south asians who as you say are vastly over-represented in successful fields, we need to have ethnically aligned award ceremonies.   Race-based awards, Racially aligned business directories.


The whole thing makes no sense and just enforces self-segregation.  E.g. south asians are not good enough to compete with the wider world.

I could understand if south asians were not successful, or there were massive income differences.  One example is something as simple as the various south asian football groups in the uk.  South asians for cultural reasons often don't get involved in football.  As such there are various youth leagues that focus on asian players.  I don't agree with such racial divisions, and they often get around laws by having teams associated with gurdwaras or the masjid, but still, it provides an even playing field, and the opportunity to win cups/awards in an environment where the kids can succeed and develop skills.  Even though there is some justification in this; it still looks and smells like apartheid however.  Why not use merit to get ahead?

I'm not saying that you are living in a ghetto, but I am saying that self segregation does nothing for cohesion.  'asian business awards' - the idea of a trophy if you do well AND have brown skin seems ridiculous and shouldn't be part of free and fair society.

I believe that the biggest fundamental cause of inequality in our modern society is hereditary wealth. Right wing politicians love the idea of a meritocracy. But nothing undermines a meritocracy quite like giving some people a headstart and not providing enough assistance for those who were disadvantaged to catch up (Quick example: No student loans for Masters level study. See: http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2013/jan/19/oxford-university-st-hughs-sued-student-fees). Inheritance tax goes some way to levelling the playing field*.

Increasing the minimum inheritance tax threshhold would increase inequality. Reducing it would probably be going too far in the other direction, as it would start to tax the majority. Freezing it is a good move in my opinion (Yes, this will be a real reduction, but they have frozen public sector wages and benefits, why should inheritance tax be exempt?).

In 1869 new rations of tinned mutton were introduced for British seamen. They were unimpressed by it, and decided it must be the butchered remains of Fanny Adams. The way her body had been strewn over a wide area presumably encouraged speculation that parts of her had been found at the Royal Navy victualling yard in Deptford, which was a large facility which included stores, a bakery and an abattoir.
""Fanny Adams"" became slang for mutton[6] or stew and then for anything worthless – from which comes the current use of ""sweet Fanny Adams"" (or just ""sweet F.A."") to mean ""nothing at all"". It can be seen as a euphemism for ""fuck all"" – which means the same.
This is not the only example of Royal Navy slang relating to unpopular rations: even today, tins of steak and kidney pudding are known as ""baby's head"".

I didn't say there was none at all - but within reason, I'm not sure it's been an issue for several decades.

No, you went straight from one to the other merely by chance, yes? Wow, I've never seen someone dig whilst trying to back-pedal at the same time.

Please do share this shinning example of a page 3 girl who has ""hit the big time"" in social recognition and respect of society. (yes i do think its your strongest example)

&gt;you also seem incapable to understand the prostitute wasn't a &gt;vocational comparison to ""Glamour models""
No, you went straight from one to the other merely by chance, yes? Wow, I've never seen someone dig whilst trying to back-pedal at the same time.

clearly you are complete moron, as you seem to think the example of comparing one socially degrading job with your same warped logic to illustrate ""its not as simple as that"", is somehow i direct comparison of the two jobs (there is no back peddling here you are just too stupid to see the point)

&gt;Says the redditor who still thinks that showing skin for $ morally lowers you, while somehow unable to comprehend how many examples there are to make that attitude a joke

As opponents increasingly stay deep, Tottenham will need more players capable of breaking down a packed defence, which doesn’t seem their speciality in recent weeks.""

Great article, but this brings up a bunch of questions... (Warning, new soccer fan)

* If Bale is being marked by 2-3 players, why isn't there a ridiculous amount of open space on the opposite side of the field? Is this just due to the asymmetry of defense/offense (i.e. there are more people playing back on defense than there are playing forward on offense)
* How does a team go about exploiting this... have an extra midfield player play further forward? Are we doing this? If so, why isn't it working?
* And two sets of questions related to how double marking Bale could be exploited...

1.  Does this mean that we have a big talent problem on the right side? And who's ""fault"" would it be? Lennon not taking advantage? Holtby? Dempsey? I have no idea how to evaluate player talent at this point...
2.  Instead, if we're unable to exploit Bale being double marked by playing another player forward, why is that? Because it's just a bad idea? Because we can't because it would leave us too open defensively?


And one final thing, are we a one-dimensional team? What's preventing us from having a more dynamic offense?

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt; in a discussion on that very topic you don't bring out the biggest example you just bring out an (at best) irrelevance.

Or you bring out a single, random example and let the responder froth and exaggerate instead of providing any of their own. Over several posts.

&gt;it's like someone arguing against ""all Jew's are stupid"" by saying ""my milkman is Jewish and he is clever"" e.g ignoring Einstein.

And would still hold water - or would the clever milkman not count unless he was 'famous'? You're actually the one pretending Einstein doesn't exist, by demanding an Einstein example when you can't even deal with a TV presenter.

&gt;Please do share this shinning example of a page 3 girl who has ""hit the big time"" in social recognition and respect of society. 

Ah, so now it's not 'anyone that shows their skin for $', it *has* to be page 3 which is, of course, entirely different in a moral sense, right? Carole Smilie (who most people would know) did page three - can you provide examples of her doing this causing the downfall of her career?

&gt;clearly 

You really need to work on understanding this word.

&gt;you are complete moron, as you seem to think the example of comparing one socially degrading job with your same warped logic to illustrate ""its not as simple as that"", is somehow i direct comparison of the two jobs 

In the course of a conversation, that was your next example, and it really doesn't matter if you acknowledge it or not, it gives away your opinion - welcome to the world of you-not-getting-to-dictate-what-others-think when you don't bother to proof-read or deploy some sort of comprehension. I guess 'reading between the lines' must be a new concept, invented by 'morons' who actually check their own typing for spelling mistakes.

&gt;lol and yet you have not provided one good example of someone in ""high society""

We weren't talking about 'high society' - we were talking about selling looks for $ and your need to catch up. But extra bonus points for giving another example of your arrogance.

&gt;who was a ""glamour model"" 

Yes, I have. And there are lots of others; a leading Doctor (the type you asserted earlier was a moral example of virtue) famously kept a journal of being a prostitute (your favourite!) - now illustrate her 'moral decline' since she was 'outed'. At this point, you can go google for more.

&gt;I can provided many who were ""glamour models"" who are reviled and laughed at, must just be a big coincidence eh?

And I can provide many doctors who became alcoholics and were stuck off. One of us still thinks that their dignity has to be 'purchased back'. 

&gt;why dont you see what would happen if the PM's wife was discovered to be an ex glamour model, im sure no one would bat an eyelid, im sure teh same is true of royalty too 

Why, would either of those mean that it was impossible for all, or the norm? Really, try and give this some thought before posting. You wouldn't, after all, want to look like a 'complete moron'.",0,1360598944,null,0,false,0,c8d9gop,t3_18aubh,t1_c8d9gop,t1_c8d93eq,null,1431259766,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
