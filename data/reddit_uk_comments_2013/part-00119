true,[deleted],null,null,"As a young boy, Joe was completely obsessed with tractors. He had pictures of tractors all over his bedroom walls; he had tractor toys, tractor T-shirts, a tractor carpet, and duvet cover, the whole works.
He ate, drank and slept tractors. On his 17th birthday he was thrilled to get an invitation to go to a tractor factory nearby and test-drive a brand new tractor.

His excitement was incredible as he told his family and friends. The great day came and he went to the factory for the test-drive.
Unfortunately something went terribly wrong with the tractor when Joe was driving it and it flipped over, trapping and breaking Joe's leg and fracturing his skull.

He was so upset and tried to sue the tractor company for negligence. But the company would have none of it and told him there was no liability and he could get lost!

You can imagine he was very annoyed with tractors after this and vowed to shed them from his life completely and forever. All the posters came down, the toys were given away - tractors were GONE.

Many years later, Joe went into a bar for a drink. Inside, the cigarette and cigar smoke was terrible but through it he saw a beautiful girl seated at the bar on her own. Tears were streaming down her face.

Joe asked her what was wrong and she said that the smoke was making her eyes sting and stream with tears.

With that, Joe looked around and then took a huge breath, sucking in all the smoke. He then walked outside into the car park and blew all the smoke out again. He goes back into the bar where the air is now clear and sweet and sits down next to the girl.

""That was amazing!"" she said, ""How did you do that?""

""No problem"", said Joe...

We may have won in the revolution, but that's because we fought dirty as shit. And we didn't even have a proper victory until Saratoga. 

The way England just *held on* during the blitz and until we arrived is nothing short of astonishing. If you hadn't held on, the war could've gone on until the 50s even. The Russians were good, but they needed the second front. And that wouldn't have been possible until the B-36 (transatlantic bomber) would've been in service, which was 46-47.

I doubt this would help though as the people who decide don't get told much about the person, just their qualifications, personal statement and the fact they're international so there's no bias.

Entry requirements have got tighter over the last couple of years since our profile has been rising (4th in the UK for NSS!!!) but like another poster said, the fact that she's international will very much work in her favour. The uni prides itself on being international so has a higher proportion of places allocated to international students and with the new campuses in Dubai and Malaysia to fund, they are always looking for people who will pay! The entry requirements are set by Highers and GCSEs and their international equivalents which don't always balance up very well so the fact she's under by just a little bit probably won't make too much of a difference as there is a degree of error anyway.

You are arguing that since the agency has said two contradictary things; that he should be imprisoned, and later that he should be free, that we can't trust either of them equally and thus it would be foolish to believe either one or the other. 

That's ridiculous because they have an interest in one of those things and not the other. They have an interest in locking people up, because that's what they do, they are running a prison camp. They have no interest in freeing people, because they can only lose.

So when an agency that has a great interest in imprisoning someone tells you they need to imprison someone, it doesn't carry much weight.

It seems like you want a single thread for rumors regarding a particular player, created and led by a knowledgeable OP.  First and foremost, this sub is not large enough to expect there to be someone knowledgeable enough to start a discussion for any given player and who has the time to put into that thread.  Additionally, transfer news gets spread out over days, weeks, months sometimes.  A single thread created when we get linked is not going to be sufficient two weeks later when we actually make a bid, or two weeks after that when we sign them; it won't be on the front page, and a lot of people probably won't even remember it existed or won't have seen it in the first place.  Another thing to keep in mind is that a lot of people don't go out to those ""news"" websites and instead rely on people like /u/LeTouche to bring the news here, because reddit is a news agglomeration (and discussion) website and they are happy to use it that way.  Expecting everyone to go somewhere else to find and read the news then come back and discuss it is backwards in my opinion, and not utilizing the full capabilities of the site.

Just to touch on your fragment stuff, ""good points"" are going to be lost no matter what when whatever thread they are in leaves the front page.  The good points always get repeated though, and with multiple threads at various times those points are going to reach a wider audience.

The current model appears to be ""find new article, post it, let people discuss"" as well as three weekly threads related to youth, first team, and transfers.

Ben was very particular though, he liked to keep a routine and ordered the same drink, sat in the same place, arrived at the same time. He liked to keep everything the same and he loved going there, it was the high point of his week the nights he went there, everybody was like family and helped him see the point of carrying on.

 One night Ben arrives at the to see a badger sat in 'his' seat, and sighed inwardly. Badgers are notoriously difficult, after all. So he wanders over and says

""Excuse me mate""

""*What?*"" replied the badger, rather tersely.

""Well I'm sorry to bother you, but I just wanted to ask if you wouldn't mind moving, please? I'm a bit of a regular here and it's kind of like my thing to sit here.""

""*Afraid not, fella*""

""Look please, I don't want any trouble or anything it just really ruins my night if my routine gets put out""

""*No*"" an edge entering the badger's voice. The conversation continued like that for a while and gradually grew more heated until tensions spilled over, and the two started fighting. Naturally the badger came out on top, and sadly Ben lost his tail and his life.

 The patrons were stunned, horrified by what they'd just witnessed. A night or two passes and the pub's to be found in a scene of mourning. It's closed early to allow a candle-lit wake to be held in the honour of the deceased, so respects can properly be paid. The interior of the room is garbed in black, as are the occupants who're sat in rows facing a small plinth atop which sits an ornate carved box containing Ben's tail; all they have left with which to remember him by.

 As the landlord steps up infront of the group to say a few words, a gentle tapping echoes through the still air from the direction of the door. ^^Knock! ^^Knock! The landlord's brow creased *Surely not somebody at the door at this hour?* he thought, casting his gaze over the faces of the mourners infront of him, all of which were wearing expressions of confusion not dissimilar to the one which contorted his own features, double checking all those who were supposed to be in attendance were there. *Everybody's here...it's too late for travellers. No, I must just be imagin-* ^Knock! ^Knock! the sound echoed again, a little more insistent this time, and a murmur ran through the group as the atmosphere shifted into discomfort. *Right. Okay!* thought the landlord again as he stepped through the small crowd and accepted it wasn't his imagination.

 He took a moment to steel himself before unbolting the door and cracking it open slightly, only to be met the sight of Ben's ghost. Ben's ghost was, in turn, met with the sight of a dumbstruck man, mouth hanging open yet quivering slightly, as if the words caught in it were desperate to make themselves heard but afraid at the same time.

""Hello..."" Ben's greeting was met with silence. After a few seconds he tried again

""Er, hello. I don't know if you remember me [a large factor of Ben's popularity was his unassuming nature] but I was a regular here, and got into a fight the other night with a badger. As you can see, I died and lost my tail (a gesture to the stump at the base of his spine followed) and I was just wondering if I could please have it back?"" again Ben's enquiry was met with a vacant blink and the sound of silence. After a while, Ben had another go.

""So, could I please have it back?"" this at last drew a reaction from the landlord, who managed to stutter through his obvious shock

""Er...s-sorry, but we, we don't retail spirits after ten""

true,KnightDarkThe,null,null,"The reason why I say that trophy cabinets are a bad argument is solely based on the fact that football is a team game. It's 11 on 11, so if one player slacks you're not going to feel as much of an effect as compared to 5 on 5 basketball, where superstars coming together equates to success. When you're playing on Spain who have a fantastic defense, one of the best midfields (if not arguably the best) in international football, and a very strong forward line (Torres included when it comes to 2008), you're going to win trophies.

I agree with the statement that stats are only part of the story, but let's be realistic here: they're one of the best ways to provide comparisons, because what else is there? Gut feeling? opinions? If that's the case, then I agree Torres is a hard worker, but his sulking and often lackadaisical forward play (I mean, how often has he not beaten the first defender? Or lost control? Too often to count) is just something that a world class striker should not have and display on a very consistent basis. Shades of his former glorious self? You know you're not doing well when people continually say that about you. If it was shades of slacking, etc., then it wouldn't be a problem obviously.

I don't understand what you mean right here. Brentford are, by far, a ""lesser"" team. They're not even in the premier league. I respect them for getting as far as they did in the FA Cup and nearly beating us at their home, but other than that, they aren't a top side, and that's just being realistic. Sure anything can happen in the FA Cup, like Wigan dominating City, but the fact is Brentford are still..well..Brentford.

I was only able to watch the first half of the Arsenal game at the Emirates (though I did sneak in a replay later), but what I remember was that besides the goal, Torres wasn't performing well at all. Didn't he miss a one on one or lose the ball at an essential moment or we would have had a second? Just a thought that came to my mind about that match. He can't score all the time, but that's just an example of how he wasn't having a great game, unless I remember incorrectly.

Yes, Mata scored, and Cahill and Ivanovic scored, etc, but that doesn't change the fact that Torres could very easily had more goals. Many more goals. In fact, a more competent striker put through the amount of games and minutes Torres played would likely have had more goals. I don't see how the whole ""system change"" argument has any effect here, because I remember countless times of him choking at the end of a play and falling, or mishitting, or hitting a poor shot, or doing something else that he's become accustomed to. 

Well, I don't understand why you don't think so. Once again, since you're not very keen when it comes to stats, I'll try to reason with you based on opinion. You can't honestly tell me that Torres has, about a million times, run into the first defender, or scuffed chances wide, or try to dribble too much and end up losing the ball rather than shoot with just the goalkeeper to beat? It's infuriating, and I along with the commentators for those games, etc. all realize and know that he does this because he's lacking in confidence. When a guy's too scared to shoot when he has a chance, what else can you reason it to? When you're lacking in confidence, you're not going to have the composure a world class striker needs to have in front of goal to put the ball in the net. As for the skill argument, refer back to the losing the ball to the first guy, trying to dribble too much, etc. Maybe that lackadaisical play has to do with his lack of confidence, who knows. The point I'm making is that he's not good enough. Going into next season with Torres is our primary goal threat just isn't going to cut it with the expectations Chelsea and especially Mourinho have.",0,1371162435,null,0,false,0,caiefgl,t3_1g7vkm,t1_caiefgl,t1_cai6mhx,null,1430818441,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

It doesn't have much to do with architecture. It's building services and performance with a big portion of mechanical engineering. I'm on a placement right now and my position is as a mechanical engineer. There's detailed design of services such as heating and cooling, building design to reduce the need for services (like what it's made of, how big the windows are etc), sustainability and renewable energy, accousitcs, lighting, and also a bit on how people use and resond to buildings.

I love it because it's covers so many things and gives you so many areas you can go in to. We're really employable too, companies love our degree!

This here is Griffin [Park] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Griffin_Park_aerial_2011.jpg)

It has a capacity of 12,000 and Chelsea are allocated 2000 of these tickets.  The home fans are telling you exactly what they think of you and what they would like to do to your Mother.  They sit just two metres from where you are taking a throw in and it is relentless for 90 minutes on a cold winters Sunday in London in January.  The pitch is nothing like the velvet of Stamford Bridge and you are the existing Champions of Europe in a London Derby.  The shouts of ""Fernando Torres - you are not welcome here"" - have been echoing all game and winding you up, so with 7 minutes to go - you equalise and force the replay.  But it is not any old equaliser, it a world class equaliser that silences the home support.

There is very little creative design in it. Anything we design is in terms of how energy is used, not how it looks.

First thing that leaps out at me here is ""Her marks are all around lower than their ""minimums"", but not by much"" - is she sure she can do the course? The minimums aren't just there for exclusivity, they're also to cut down on the drop-out rate. I'm a big fan of second chances, and if she just assesses poorly, that's fine, but it's something to think carefully about.

Beyond that; personal statement will make or break the application if you're applying below the grades wanted. Personally I would make sure it covers:

1. Why she thinks she can do the course despite not having the grades.

2. Why she wants to study at Heriott-Watt. Universities really want to know that if they accept someone, they'll actually turn up, so showing enthusiasm for the institution gives them warm fuzzies. On that note; do not, whatever she does, talk about other institutions she may be considering.

3. If she's been to an open day, mention it, shows enthusiasm and a good understanding of what she's getting herself in for. Really shows enthusiasm if she's coming from Florida, too. The university should have a note of this anyway, but in my experience it's very easy for the connection not to be made.

4. Possibly talk a little about enthusiasm for the locale; why Edinburgh, has she visited before? Does she really like the architecture, history, location, events?

Chances are probably not too bad; while UK/EU places are effectively capped by the amount of funded places available, for full tuition students the university is much less constrained. Being below the minimum marks won't help, though, so it's not by any means going to be trivial either.

Governments claimed to be opening university education to the ""low income family"" when all they were doing were opening university to the less intelligent and those with no aspirations to further there employment prospects. University has suddenly become some alcohol fuelled rite of passage for people to waste large portions of their time for 3 years of their life...

Now successive governments are just using student loans as a way of passing national debt on to the next government, by underwriting student debt. The reality is the large loans new students will take out will never be paid and will just be written of leaving a large hole in the budget of a future government.

It is just a typical Tory policy, sell off assets for a short term gain transferring the cost to the citizens. I would If any move by to change the interest rate requires commons approval it will fail, hopefully the Lib Dems would find a conscience after abandoning so many students who voted for them as well as Labour supporting the many students they financed through university.

1. Again, her grades are fine, but her high school test scores are the problem. Do you think she should even address this? If her transcript shows she has proficiency in math and physics, do you think she needs to explain away her average test scores? I mean, they are not bad, but I don't feel as if she should call attention to them.

2. Sounds good, that sounds pretty straight-forward. Maybe research other programs to see in what ways their program is different than others, and use these as reasons for choosing Heriot-Watt? There's no doubt that they know and are probably proud of what makes them unique, right?

3. No open day, unfortunately. 

4. Sounds good. Do you think she should leave out that her boyfriend (me) is moving there as a reason for applying?

true,UK-Redditor,null,null,"Fine example of British stiff-upper-lip at the Battle of Imjin River. It's an incredible example of the British Army at it's very finest, if you haven't heard it before you need to know.

I'm no historian, but I'll do my best to summarise the most relevant information from my own knowledge and a collection of sources I'll outline at the end of the comment.

In 1951, during the Korean War, US 1 Corps (commanded by [Lt. Gen. Frank Milburn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_W._Milburn)) and UN troops under their command were tasked with holding a position along the Imjin River after a successful UN counter-offensive against Chinese forces. The Chinese were seeking to launch their own Spring offensive to force their way back across the river and continue south-east to recapture the South Korean capital of Seoul. Under the command of 1 Corps were the British 29th Independent Brigade (commanded by [Brig. Thomas Brodie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Brodie)), consisting of:

* 1st Battalion [Gloucestershire Regiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucestershire_Regiment) (commanded by [Lt. Col. James Carne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Power_Carne))
* 1st Battalion [Royal Northumberland Fusiliers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Northumberland_Fusiliers) (commanded by Lt. Col. Kingsley Foster)
* [Royal Ulster Rifles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ulster_Rifles) (under temporary command of Maj. Gerald Rickord)
* Belgian battalion of 700 men (commanded by Lt. Col. Albert Crahay), to which Luxembourg's contribution to the UN forces was attached.
* Also attached were 45 Field Regiment Royal Artillery (equipped with 25 pounder artillery), 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars (commanded by Maj. Henry Huth) and 170th Independent Mortar Battery Royal Artillery (equipped with 4.2"" mortars).

The four battalions of 29th Bde (~5000 men) were tasked with defending a key section of the Imjin River, 12 miles across, necessitating gaps between the units. As it was expected the position would only be held for a short time, no extensive defensive preparations (such as minefields, deeply dug shelters or extensive wire defenses) were carried out; the position was deemed safe but vulnerable in case of attack.

On 22nd April 1951, 29 Bde came under attack by *2 divisions* of Chinese soldiers (27,000-30,000 men), north of the Imjin River. The defending forces were vastly outnumbered (~6:1) and through fierce fighting over the course of the next 3 days, the Chinese managed to cross the river and penetrate the defensive line between the Gloucestershire Regt and the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, and to force their withdrawal from their forward positions. After unsuccessful attempts to regain the positions, US 1 Corps ordered the withdrawal of UN forces to a new defensive position further south on 23rd April.

Having suffered heavy casualties, and running low on supplies, the men of the Gloucestershire Regt withdrew and re-formed on Hill 235, where they set up a perimeter defence. The surviving ~500 men (having suffered ~100 casualties) from 1 GLOSTERS, completely isolated and alone other than for fire support, came under attack from an entire Chinese division (~15,000 men). US [Maj. Gen. Soule](http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/rhsoule.htm) asked [Brig. Thomas Brodie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Brodie) how the Glosters were doing, he famously replied ""Things are pretty sticky down there"". Maj. Gen. Soule ordered the Glosters to hold firm and await relief the following morning. This relief was sent in the form of armoured support from the Philippine 10th Battalion Combat Team and the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars; despite reaching a point only 2000 yards away from Hill 235 on 24th April, they were halted when the lead tank was taken out by Chinese artillery, making their further advance against heavy resistance impossible. At this point the US command deemed it ""unwise to continue the effort to relieve the Gloucester Battalion"" and withdrew the relief force. Maj. Huth, OC of the 8th Hussars commented that the entire withdrawal was ""one long bloody ambush""; among those killed was Lt. Col. Foster, the OC of the Fusiliers, who was killed when his jeep was hit by a mortar.

The 500 men from 1 GLOSTERS held firm against an entire division of Chinese soldiers for over 24 hours, covering the withdrawal of the rest of 29 Bde, and indeed the entire left flank of 1 Corps. It was only after 24 hours of fierce fighting and with 45 Field Regt RA no longer able to provide fire 25lber fire support, that the Glosters' OC, 
[Lt. Col. James Carne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Power_Carne), gave the order to withdraw from their besieged position and make for the British/UN lines to the South. Only 39 of them made it successfully, the rest were killed, wounded or taken prisoner.

[A memorial was erected on Hill 235](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloster_Hill), now known as Gloster Hill, to commemorate the 'Glorious Glosters' who were ordered to ""Hold on where you are"".

About 25% of the 29th Independent Brigade as a whole had been killed over three days of fighting; the Chinese 63rd Army had lost about 40% of its men.

Here is the Presidential Unit Citation from the US Army:

The 1ST BATTALION GLOUCESTERSHIRE REGIMENT, BRITISH ARMY and TROOP C, 170TH INDEPENDENT MORTAR BATTERY, ROYAL ARTILLERY, attached, are cited for exceptionally outstanding performance of duty and extraordinary heroism in action against the armed enemy near Solma-ri, Korea on the 23rd, 24th and 25th of April, 1951. The 1st BATTALION and TROOP C were defending a very critical sector of the battle front during a determined attack by the enemy. The defending units were overwhelmingly outnumbered. The 83rd Chinese Communist Army drove the full force of its savage assault at the positions held by the 1st BATTALION, GLOUCESTERSHIRE REGIMENT and attached unit. The route of supply ran Southeast from the battalion between two hills. The hills dominated the surrounding terrain northwest to the Imjin River. Enemy pressure built up on the battalion front during the day 23 April. On 24 April the weight of the attack had driven the right flank of the battalion back. The pressure grew heavier and heavier and the battalion and attached unit were forced into a perimeter defence on Hill 235. During the night, heavy enemy forces had by-passed the staunch defenders and closed all avenues of escape. The courageous soldiers of the battalion and attached unit were holding the critical route selected by the enemy for one column of the general offensive designed to encircle and destroy 1st Corps . These gallant soldiers would not retreat. As they were compressed tighter and tighter in their perimeter defence, they called for close-in air strikes to assist in holding firm. Completely surrounded by tremendous numbers, these indomitable, resolute, and tenacious soldiers fought back with unsurpassed fortitude and courage. As ammunition ran low and the advancing hordes moved closer and closer, these splendid soldiers fought back viciously to prevent the enemy from overrunning the position and moving rapidly to the south. Their heroic stand provided the critically needed time to regroup other 1st Corps units and block the southern advance of the enemy. Time and again efforts were made to reach the battalion, but the enemy strength blocked each effort. Without thought of defeat or surrender, this heroic force demonstrated superb battlefield courage and discipline. Every yard of ground they surrendered was covered with enemy dead until the last gallant soldier of the fighting battalion was over-powered by the final surge of the enemy masses. The 1st BATTALION, GLOUCESTERSHIRE REGIMENT and TROOP C, 170th INDEPENDENT MORTAR BATTERY displayed such gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in accomplishing their mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions as to set them apart and above other units participating in the same battle. Their sustained brilliance in battle, their resoluteness, and extraordinary heroism are in keeping with the finest traditions of the renowned military forces of the British Commonwealth, and reflect unsurpassed credit on these courageous soldiers and their homeland.

[Lt. Col. James Carne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Power_Carne) was awarded the VC and the US's DSC in recognition of his gallant and distinguished service. ""On two separate occasions, armed with rifle and grenades, he personally led assault parties which drove back the enemy and saved important situations. His courage, coolness and leadership was felt not only in his own battalion but throughout the whole brigade.""

[Lt. Philip Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Kenneth_Edward_Curtis) was awarded a posthumous VC for his role in almost single-handedly destroying a vital Chinese machine gun post in a desperate counter-attack to regain one of the lost positions. [Gen. Sir Farrar-Hockley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Farrar-Hockley) (who was present as a Captain, at the time) accounts that after beginning his daring attack in which 2 men were killed and Lt. Curtis himself was gravely wounded:  'We must take the Castle Site,' he says; and gets up to take it. The others beg him to wait until his wounds are tended. One man places a hand on his side. 'Just wait until Papworth has seen you, sir-'
But Phil has gone: gone to the wire, gone through the wire, gone towards the bunker. The other come out behind him, their eyes all on him. And suddenly it seems as if, for a few breathless moments, the whole of the remainder of that field of battle is still and silent, watching amazed, the lone figure that runs so painfully forward to the bunker holding the approach to the Castle Site: one tiny figure, throwing grenades, firing a pistol, set to take Castle Hill.
Perhaps he will make it - in spite of his wounds, in spite of the odds - perhaps this act of supreme gallantry may, by its sheer audacity, succeed. But the machine-gun in the bunker fires into him: he staggers, falls, and is dead instantly; the grenade he threw a second before his death explodes after it in the mouth of the bunker. The machine-gun does not fire on three of Phil's platoon who run forward to pick him up; it does not fire again through the battle: it is destroyed; the muzzle blown away, the crew dead.

[Lt. Terrence ""Terry"" Waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Waters_%28GC%29) was awarded a GC for his gallant conduct shortly after capture. Despite being seriously wounded from the battle and held in terrible conditions (along with the other POWs) he refused to comply with a North Korean Political Officer offering first aid and better treatment, although ordered his men to pretend to accede in order to save their lives. In doing this, Lt. Waters sacrificed his own well-being for the lives of his men whilst maintaining the British prestige to the utmost. He died a short time after. He was a young, inexperienced officer, comparatively recently commissioned from the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst; yet he set an example of the highest gallantry.

[Cpt. Anthony Farrar-Hockley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Farrar-Hockley) was awarded a DSO, despite it usually being reserved for more senior ranks, with the citation: ""Throughout this desperate engagement on which the ability of the Battalion to hold its position entirely depended, Captain Farrar-Hockley was an inspiration to the defenders. His outstanding gallantry, fighting spirit and great powers of leadership heartened his men and welded them into an indomitable team. His conduct could not have been surpassed"".

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"To be honest you lost me as soon as you mentioned stats, they mean very little, especially when playing in such different style teams. 

Also a bit of a flaw is the fact you were comparing him with Mary rather than both him and Pienaar. Moses is super versatile, and many people (including Martinez, judging by where he played him back in the Wigan days) feel he is most effective as an inverted winger on the left hand side  (traditionally Pienaar's hitting zone), quite what the front line would look like if he did sign is up for debate, but he is just as likely to sit in the left or middle rather than the right. 

Also worth noting that Mary is stronger on the left hand side of an attacking triad according to Olympiacos fans- attempts at playing that way this year ended in misery shortly after they begun, but with a new manager and an entire pre-season to work on it you never know what might spring up. 

For the sake of discussion though, if he was to come in as a flanker- I could see him playing alongside Mary and Pienaar for this season- but taking over Steven's position more and more as the months and years pass. The guy is not getting any younger, and his ability seems to have suffered a lot this year, going missing far more than he used to- still has an absolute world of quality when on form, but if he continues to decline we might be forced to bring in a replacement for him next summer regardless. 

Aside from the over-reliance on stats the analysis is pretty solid, I agree we are not lacking width compared to other positions- and there are far bigger fish we need to fry (someone who doesn't hate scoring for a start).. But saying that we know nothing of our budget, or Martinez's long term plan for shaping the side- perhaps he is more concerned than we think about Pienaar's age. 

It is a bit of a shitty place to be as a fan at the moment.. We need to sit down and trust what the staff are doing, and it is not going to go tits up- of course.. Everton being Everton it has every possibility of doing just that, at least if we bring in proven League quality then things can't go too badly.

true,Kerrt,null,null,"The Dame of Malta, Elizabeth Mary II was the head of the Committee of 300 and thus the Commonwealth Crown but this changed in 1975. Jesuit trained King Juan Carlos of Spain took control of the power in 1975 when the Jesuits reinstalled the House of Bourbon. The House of Bourbon is the second oldest monarchy on Earth behind the Emperor system of Japan. King Juan Carlos is the most important Protector of the Holy Sites of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem and a great power over the World from the Middle East to North Africa to South America and more. He controls industries such as chocolate and coffee as well as the international drugs trade through the Exchange Stabilization Fund mastered via the United States aided by families such as the Spring scion.

The City of London is a complicated system my friends because it is a sovereign nation upon British soil (Blessed Isles of Albion) like the Vatican is on Italian soil (Saturnia). Where it gets complicated is when you find out there is yet another sovereign piece of land within the already sovereign City of London. This inner core is of course the important New Jerusalem of which Elizabeth Mary II is a member. Within the City of London the Lord Mayor is the King and power along with his court the City of London Corporation. Elizabeth Mary II has zero powers within the City of London and this is why she cannot enter the City in any regalia. She can only wear the regalia in England etc since she has power there but not to the City and has not since 1215. You will notice that the monarchy never seem to wear regalia at all these days, since when did we notice this? Is this because almost all of the land was submerged under water and thus under the power of the Vatican again via the Maritime Admiralty Law system based on Vatican Canon Law. One can be very powerful in one or more places but not another but still have power to attempt to overthrow or counter power in that area to which they do not have power.

The Lord Mayor position is changed annually and yes it is manned by a commoner. A commoner can have power over a bloodline if he is connected in a position of power with the money-changers who loan out to the bloodlines. Remember Britain had only £9million in the bank when its debts back in the 1914 were £950 million which was raised to £21 billion by the 1930s. This was the way that the Jesuits and their Rothschild family bankrupted England and bought in the vile Uniform Commercial Code submerging us under water and thus under the Law of the High Sea. From this time onwards Britain came under the Roman Civil Law system and lost its English Common Law by way of deceit, in truth the English Common Law still stands but judges are so corrupt they deny you a real courtroom. Until the nations dump the central banks and the City of London power then we will never be free. We need to also focus on Switzerland which is more openly bloodline controlled such as the Canton of Geneva run by the House of Savoy headed by Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV. Please study the power of the Bank of International Settlements but more importantly the Universal Postal Union which is just around the corner from the Vatican Embassy.

Elizabeth Mary II is a Princess of the unHoly Roman Empire (little horn) and she is the wealthiest being on Earth. Just check out what one of her gold carriages is worth and be shocked to your bones. She is wealthier than the Pope and the King of Saudi Arabia. You are correct about the Guelph bloodlines and she has Germanic connections which are also very important in banking and highly connected to the Roman Empire. It is very complicated when you start entering into the highest levels of this conspiracy. A being with great power can be seen as less than another in some other area but in truth still higher in the grand scale. We have to remember that Monarchs are seen as having a Divine right to rule and thus believe they are connected to God in some way or from God themselves. It is not easy to break that power and replace it with a common man in any way. This could only be replaced by those who believe they are from another God. Who has destroyed monarchies, popes and Governments? Why it is the dreaded Jesuit Order the masters of the Order of the Bavarian Illuminati using Giuseppe Balsamo and Jesuit sheep-dipped Adam Weishaupt. The Jesuits created the Illuminati to shield their Aragon Templar actions so this organization would take the blame. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was created in Rome in 1491 before the Jesuits were even formed as the Jesuits in 1531.

Whilst there's only been one Pjanic thread now, mine. I'm not going to post 'em willy nilly, and hence one thread for a certain thread or rumour once a fortnight isn't really that bad.

I think the fact that it's the summer window has really changed things, and you're not going to get these endless discussions that you're after.

We have days for certain discussions, I do the first team ones on mondays, and friday, tomorrow, today for me, is the time for a rumour one. Perhaps that'll be Pjanic, who knows, but I'm sure it'll come up.

But seriously. I, and cacafogo, alike, don't really agree with you that we've descended into a mess of rumour upon rumour, as there's in depth discussion mixed in. I don't think it's a problem as of now. 

If you do, I encourage you to start a thread or 2 asking about our rumoured targets so that you can both learn more and promote discussion. That'd centralise commenting, and give you the community feel you're after.

* the number of home vs international places at UK universities are not really connected. Home students are a letter of government funding, international students are 'can we fit them in the lecture hall'.

* It's normal for English universities to accept students who don't meet the entry requirements for a few reasons, and I expect the same applies to the Scots. Basically universities make offers before students have their final results so the offers are conditional: they have to avoid getting more students than they can handle so once results are in some people they have made offers to will not have got high enough exam marks. These people are frequently accepted if they haven't missed by much, and then remaining places are filled through a process called clearing. Obviously this occurs rather less at top than middle ranked universities. Not sure about Herriot-Watt. I don't know how much this applies to international students since your gf will of course be applying based on existing grades.

* Having said that, whether she can handle the course is important. From my limited teaching experience, there are a certain number of students every year who are just out of their depth. The British education system is peculiar in that everyone is required to do everything at the same speed, so what course you do is usually determined by how old you are, not whether you are ready.

true,tobbern,null,null,"Well, if I might. The Daleks and Cybermen in particular were designed in the post-WWII experience, so they were extreme interpretations of Nazism and Communism, which was seen in a very bad light in the UK. In order to put this on TV without making it political, Doctor Who had to find a way to communicate these ideals to children and adults and, preferably, show them the strengths and weaknesses of their ideals. Keep in mind that Doctor Who became popular during an age where a scientific revolution was well underway in science and social sciences, and the Doctor is the super-rational hero who brings this age into its right. While most TV shows attempt to teach viewers something, Doctor Who is almost exclusively about this didactic story-telling style, a constant attempt to improve the human race over time. That's also why the Doctor makes us confront our own past and future abuses. In the modern show, it's more of a psychological process, but I still see elements of this philosophy that change is necessary and unavoidable. Long rant follows to illustrate and elaborate on this.


The Daleks were designed to lack feelings for relating to ""others"", and only to be capable of destroying anything but themselves. An extreme form of racial supremacy ideology that demands all creatures be destroyed, save the Daleks themselves, could not be truly rational unless other lifeforms lacked ""worth"", and that sense of worth could not be aesthetic. So they had to lack feelings in order to accept this. This was Nazism taken to its most extreme, and some companions point it out, but the Doctor emphasizes that the Daleks are something much worse - what one might become if one accepts rationally that others are inferior to yourself.


Cybermen? Their goal is to ""upgrade"" us all into the superior form, which is - naturally - a reference to communist society, in which all are truly equal in terms of ability and rights. If you accept that diversity exists, but believe that people must be entirely equal in all respects, you end up with a dilemma: Do you force them to become equal? This is what the Cybermen are, to the extreme.


As the story developed, it was obvious that this was to be their design flaw for both of the Doctor's main enemies. They hate diversity (whereas Britain was celebrating its ""liberal democracy"" which embraces multiple groups and philosophies of right). To embrace diversity would require a person to appreciate a worldview that is not ""complete"", but continually expanding and improving - it's a deterministic view of the universe and moral philosophy. That would suggest there's some wonder experience from meeting new people and seeing new things, which is pretty much the Doctor - taken again to the extreme.


So quite often he ends up deconstructing his enemies, be they Daleks, mentally unstable evil geniuses, etc. in front of them, showing their own imperfections, in a hope that they will improve and change. While he doesn't succeed undoing the Dalek and Cybermen mentality, the fact that they change, over time, suggests to me that they are understanding some of his points about adapting to changing circumstances.


This is a pretty Kantian moral perspective, IMO. The Doctor feels it's his duty to instruct people how to relate to others (because he knows better than they do), that life is pretty much unpredictable (and it's a time-based activity), and because almost anyone can be good or bad if they lose sight of the scale of the universe. What makes one truly bad is if they accept rational superiority, but neglect the emotional impact that these choices have for themselves and others. Since almost no aliens in sci fi are entirely without feeling, this is pretty important, because DW makes an argument that without emotion, it's hard, if not impossible, to be a just and fair person.


As for people who claim it's trying to be family-friendly, I'm sorry but I must disagree. The Doctor in the old show was almost quite as violent as other TV heroes of their day, and when the show got complaints that the Doctor punched someone - they just didn't take it on board. Doctor Who was responding to a trend of TV shows. Violence attracts viewers. 


Over time, as our societies got less and less violent, so did the Doctor. And the Time War obviously made him abhor weapons. But this was not an issue he had ethical qualms with in his early incarnations. In fact, without his karate and fencing skills, the Third Doctor would be far less awesome, and without his physically imposing stature and devastating punches, the Fourth Doctor would have died an early death. They often relied on these skills, when fighting the Master or other bad guys. I recall other Doctors threw their weight around as well, but these two in particular showed no regret or hesitation to use weapons if they thought the enemy was truly a threat to their companions or the universe.",0,1371199497,null,0,false,0,caioy1v,t3_1ga4my,t1_caioy1v,t3_1ga4my,null,1430813473,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

In economic terms increasing university participation will increase worker productivity on average. Of course, if you only have 1% of the population going to university, chances are 99% of those will fully utilize the opportunity. Increase to 5% going to university, you increase the proportion of people who won't fully utilize a university education.

But since the strategy was to orient the UK as a 'managing and service' economy, e.g. we would own assets in other countries which we would manage and provide services for, increasing the capability of our workforce to do that makes perfect sense.

So no, causing a drop in unemployment was not the 'sole reason' we increased university participation.

No need for that, happy and honoured to be able to spread the word.

In fact, if anyone was considering gold might I suggest that – as great as Reddit is – any of the various forces charities might be a more appropriate alternative in this particular instance. Keep in mind that we are still involved in active Operations in Afghanistan and across the globe; it annoyed me no end to hear someone on the BBC comment during the recent celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the [""dam busters"" raid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Chastise) that we're currently ""at peace"". We're not. The fact that us lot back home can afford to forget about that is entirely thanks to the ongoing bravery and sacrifices being made by the lads over there out on the ground.

I'd like to draw particular attention to [The ABF](http://www.soldierscharity.org/) who do a lot to support our soldiers (active and retired), unfortunately they're not quite as well known as [Help for Heroes](http://www.helpforheroes.org.uk/) – although that's another great charity. Half of the money the ABF receives it passes directly to the soldiers or veterans who need it, the rest it passes on to other charities in the form of a grant.

I've also updated the post with wiki links and more information on some of the officers who were highly decorated for their actions during the battle and in its aftermath.

I use to watch it all the time and I would be amazed at some of the quality on the pitch every week. One of those players from Parma mesmerized me more so than others. His name: Gianfranco Zola. 

I did not really watch English football until high school when Beckham mania took over and everyone in my year level was supporting Manchester United. I was asked who I would support and knowing that former Serie A Italian players Zola and Vialli moved to Chelsea, I supported them and have so ever since.

Pienaar would have been another good comparison, but I find his role in the side is very different to that of Mirallas (or Moses' role for Chelsea/Wigan, from what I've seen of him). To me, Pienaar is effective in his role because he pulls in centrally, which allows Baines to supply the real width on the left. He's never had much pace, and isn't a traditional 'beat a man and get to the byline' winger per se.

Admittedly Moses may be far more versatile than I'm giving him credit for, but judging from what I've seen of him, Mirallas seems similar in what he offers. A rotating forward line of Mirallas, Pienaar and Moses could conceivably work well though.

I do think you're being a tad harsh regarding Mirallas on the left. I think he had his best performance last season (first half v Liverpool) there and it works quite well when he switches with Pienaar (West Ham at home in particular). It's just unfortunate balance-wise that neither of them seem to want to stay on the right that much.

As /u/STINKO_DE_MAYO mentioned there is a life learning experience to university but that shouldn't need to be done with £13500 of government funding each year. 

This in turn has led to more and more students taken advantage of the increased avaliablity of uni courses but are not studying degrees that will help their job prospects or contributing to the ""managing and service"" economy you talk of. Instead we have people who are getting degrees in Ancient History and Media Studies (At that this point I should apologies to those who are using these degrees to further their genuine job prospects in those fields) not because the want degrees in that field, but because they want a degree.

The successive governments of this country have created a culture where students believe without a degree there are no jobs when in reality they should have promoted work based training and apprenticeships. Why did they not do this in the first place? Because there weren't enough jobs for the increasing number of unemployed high school leavers (also the poorer quality of school education means the students were underqualified, but that is for a different debate).

The reality is successive government wants to sent more students to university because it looks good for them on two fronts, they can say ""the number of people not in employment, education, or training is down"" and secondly ""more people are going into higher education than ever before"". Maybe I was wrong to suggest this was the sole reason, but it certainly plays a big part in election time manifestos.

The only reason the Tories may ever want to readdress the terms of student loans is because they have so much money invested in them because in my opinion too many students were going to uni.

true,misterjta,null,null,"Hmm. I'm currently living in Kennington, just south of the Ring Road. Quite a nice community feel to it (village newsletter, little co-op, Best One corner shop which sells literally *everything*, from bread and milk to brasso and That Thing You Never Need Until Yours Breaks). About a 15-20 minute cycle into the City, almost entirely on cycle paths, which would mean your son doesn't have to share the road with the vicious minicab drivers down Abingdon Road.

I lived in Marston, and that had a similar thing, but parts of it can be a little rougher. Cowley can be great for the hippy vibe, but again it's kinda patchy. Both of those are probably 15 minutes cycle from the city centre, Marston is easiest to get to avoiding roads because there's a great cycle path over the marsh. Headington is nice, too.

Kidlington is further out, but very nice. Wootton is further again, but apparently has a really nice community feel to it, and it's pretty close to the city whilst still being surrounded by fields. Summertown / North Oxford is gorgeous, but *seriously* expensive these days, ditto Boar's Hill. Jericho's gone similarly upmarket.

I'd avoid Barton, Blackbird Leys and probably Rose Hill. I think they're the sort of community you'd be perfectly happy with if you grew up there and were already part of the community, but they've got a bit of a reputation. I wouldn't say it's necessarily deserved in all cases, but I think it's fair to say they're the rougher areas of the city.

Oxford's a bit weird, because it's ""rough"" areas are seemingly randomly scattered, so you can get dodgy-looking streets right in amongst places that are lovely - best bet is probably to come along and get a feel for yourself!

If you suggest to them that restaurants, like any other employer, should pay their staff a decent wage, you'll be downvoted into oblivion.  Apparently, factoring staffing costs into your budget is not part of the American Dream.

For a supposedly classless society, there's definitely an undercurrent of condescension in the way Americans talk about their service workers.  It is very common to see US redditors arguing that food servers are incapable of performing their job satisfactorily unless properly motivated by the promise of tips.  

It's almost as if, in their zeal for personal achievement through the acquisition of wealth, Americans have come to see the poor as undeserving of respect and deserving of exploitation.  It always reminds me of the Anthony Hopkins character from Howard's End, who, after causing a man to lose his job, remarks *""The poor are poor, and one's sorry for them, but there it is.""*

the aim isn't to eradicate relative poverty, so arguing it's badly targeted for this reason is incorrect as the targets are based on extensive research and are mostly precise. There are four targets: 

- reduce relative child poverty to less than 10% (from [27%](http://www.cpag.org.uk/child-poverty-facts-and-figures))
- reduce absolute poverty to less than 5% (from 16%)
- reduce material deprivation (e.g. starving, homeless, shoeless children) to less than 5%
- reduce persistent poverty (this is less precise as there is no fixed target)

true,Mr_Weeble,mccoy,McCoy,"Since the 2005 reboot, Doctor Who has been one of the country's most popular TV Shows. The BBC schedule it in Primetime against the X-Factor which is the biggest show of it's biggest rival Network (ITV). So for example for the 10th Doctor's Final episode more that 40% of people watching TV at that time were tuned in to watch it. And the Actor playing the Doctor quitting, or a new actor being cast is front page news. This means there isn't really a stereotype any more.

However, back in the 80s there was a sterotype which was much like you describe. Indeed it was probably worse in the 90s and early 00s because being a fan of a somewhat unpopular show while it is on the air is one thing, but liking a show that got cancelled 10 years ago is perhaps regarded as being a bit sad.

Doctor Who has never really been niche however, everyone in Britain tends to know the basics, time travelling guy travels in a police box, battles Daleks. It launched when the UK only had two TV networks, and when it was finally cancelled in '89 the UK had really only managed to add a few more minor networks, so even if you didn't like it you were aware if it, and might even have watched it if you hated what was on the other side more.

true,theSituation39,cnty-uk,Blocked,"I've worked as a waiter for two different restaurants in the last 6 years and I can see where some people are coming from. Personally, I don't agree with adding a service charge at the end of bills when there's a certain amount of people in your party. I know that the corporate heads would say it's to make tipping ""easier"" than working it out between everyone, but that really shouldn't dictate how much you should tip. This should be entirely up to the customer.

I know when I've had a bad day and I haven't been able to tend to tables more than I should have, so I take the tips I earn as a sort of performance review of that day. If I get bad tips, I know I need to work harder the next day and to better my customer service. If I get good tips, it means I'm doing good, but there's always room to better myself. In regards to service charge, I take that off the bills before giving it to the customers (even though I have to include it, even though it's optional, by company policy). If I deserve it, I want to earn it. I don't want to be given tips I haven't earned by default. It gives me false hope and leaves you out of pocket. 

I know the chefs deserve tips more than waiters in some instances, but this is normally resolved with the chefs being paid more than the waiters (usually ranging from £2-£5 extra an hour). With the service charge, if it does get included into the bill, it gets ""taxed"" by the company and I don't receive it until the end of the month. This also counts towards tips left on a credit card, they get taxed a certain amount by the company (this isn't the charge for using a credit card machine because they'd charge you regardless of leaving a tip or not if that was the case). I can be quite awkward when i'm looking at the customer whilst they're trying to decide how much to give me, but I try to tell them that it's entirely up to them how much they want to give. At the end of the day, I'm here to earn money to try and fund my degree. If I've done a good job and I receive a tip then great. If I've done a good job and I don't give one then I can understand the reason why I didn't get one. But some of the waiters I've encountered are slightly obsessed and rely on tips and get into bad moods when they don't get them, which is slightly over the top in my opinion.

true,[deleted],null,null,"1. I think he is still in the process of adapting, but has done a great job so far. His performances were better in European games, which may be because he is still getting used to the tempo and aggression of England. I don't see this as a problem, I think he'll be fully settled in by this time next year. 

2. A little rest does everyone good. Honestly though he seems to cope pretty well with the demanding schedule. I'd expect him to be a little sharper come August, but don't expect anything crazy. 

3. Potential is staggeringly difficult to assess, so I'm hesitant to say this, but I believe his upside is enormous. He seems to have all the attributes to be a real star player. As long as he gets substantial playing time in the correct position, I think he will develop splendidly. 

4. This is a tough question. So I don't necessarily think he's going to be better than Mata. He could be, but I certainly wouldn't want to depend on it. However, I don't think that there's any reason they can't play together in central midfield. The best analogy I would have for this would be Xavi/Iniesta. Mata is most effective when he can get into the penalty area and score/create goals. Oscar, to me, should sit slightly deeper, not like a ""deep lying playmaker"" so to speak, but not as a really high #10. I also think that Mata could quite excellently play as a shadow striker if we play in a formation that utilizes one. Anyway, I think that they can play central midfield together, and that we should try that to best utilize Mata and develop Oscar.

true,chromofoam,uk,Hertfordshire,"Thanks for your reply. There is another post somewhere on Reddit (can't find it right now) which is an account of somebody who actually lived in a country where the state carried out varying levels of surveillance on it's citizens.  It's quite chilling and worth a read.

&gt; quoted text ""Each one of your paragraphs begins reasonably, and then spirals off into insanity""  

Judging by your number of downvotes I think it's safe to say I'm not the insane one.

&gt; quoted text ""a host of crimes that the internet enables and facilitates""

So on that basis then, we should also monitor or potentially restrict the use of private letters, email, SMS, phone calls, conversations and gatherings in public (smacks of the riot act, although that's not necessarily comparable as it relates to a time of historic civil unrest)?  

If you think that the state 'monitoring' crime will stop it happening, I think that you have a misconception of crime and the motives for crime. Bad people will always find a way to do bad things, and increasing the amount you watch people will not change that. Habitual criminals will just find a new way of doing it without being seen, and in the process everyone else is a suspect under surveillance. Petty crimes may reduce in some ways, but will increase in others - you might find less bag snatchers and pickpockets, but domestic violence may increase for example as the pressure is relocated to another part of society.

&gt; quoted text ""cannot conceive of any kind of oversight that is not warrantless, violent unstable world."" (sic)

I can think of many types of oversight that are not warranted. Watching you go about your private business is not warranted or necessary or in any way helpful. In a world where everyone is a suspect for the undefined and all-encompassing crime of ""terrorism"" against sovereign nations, anything you might say flippantly, or in jest, or quoting somebody else can be construed as support for a terrorist cause and you may be implicated or detained, or simply you might just be earmarked as a minor concern. Either way you're then in a state where you have to be careful what you do, what you say, who you speak to, where you go, what you read, what you send, what you look at - the list is endless. The point is that if you sign away all of your constitutional rights, no matter which country you live in, you hand complete power to the state who will promise to protect you, but what happens if your lifestyle changes or you lose your job or a natural disaster happens and things don't go your way.....oh dang, you have no rights because you sold them down the river in the name of security. Do you genuinely believe that the 650 or so politicians in the UK houses of parliament have your best interests at the forefront of their minds? Do you REALLY think that? I get that this isn't where you're going with oversight of the internet, but it doesn't take a genius to work out that nobody gave two shits about the security of the internet for years - why now? It's not because of crime or terrorism because there were more terrorist attacks in the 70's and 80's than there have been in the last 20 years.  

Random person on a ladder outside your bedroom window watching you have sex without asking you first - are you ok with that?  OK so it's an extreme example involving something highly intimate but it's tantamount to the same thing because peoples views on their private lives is entirely subjective - what may be personal to me may not be personal to you, and it has everything to do with your moral conditioning and your attitudes to voyeurism and your social confidence - many people like to live entirely private lives and only share that which they feel comfortable with, whereas others like to let it all hang out. Therefore, to assert that a one-size-fits-all internet surveillance is ok by everybody and that they should just accept it by default is completely barmy.

&gt; quoted text ""In your third, you, again quite rightly, say that this isn't 1984, but then paint a vivid picture that means that any possible action taken by anyone ever will unavoidably lead to a police state.""

I did not say ""any action taken by anyone ever will unavoidably lead to a police state"" - I illustrated a scenario where giving away your rights COULD unfold into a situation where the state COULD force you into a corner and you'd have absolutely no powers. I never said it WOULD happen. The point I was trying to make is summed up in the old idiom of ""give them an inch and they'll take a mile"" - Will it go that way? Who can say - neither you nor I hold a crystal ball, yet I imagine that there will be a number of citizens who are complicit with the idea of being a guinea pig for the government and secret services to spy on and keep everyone 'safe' but there are a great number of people who will be deeply unhappy about not having the freedom to come and go as they please and do what they wish with their time on the planet - does one individual have the rights to judge the actions of another person, and then deem those actions as detrimental to the state and the people of the nation? We are all born equal in the sense that we are made of the same flesh and blood, so does a uniform and a badge and the powers of unrestricted surveillance change that?  

Furthermore, it's well known and pretty much proven fact that government acts to an alarming degree in the interests of corporations and lobbyists, so in fact you're saying that you're ok with being to all intents and purposes captive to the will and objectives of somebody who is wealthier than you either by pure hard work, sheer luck, or just because they were born with money. Is this not contrary to a widely held belief (or fiction) that everybody should be free to live their lives in a way that makes them happy and that means they can be healthy, and enjoy a reasonable smattering of wealth? If you support giving up your own freedoms, and in doing so the freedoms of people who are innocent and to any degree, whether on the internet or in the 'real world', then that would contradict the basis of living in a democratic culture, and giving up these notions, is that not so? Does it not make everything that people like Julian Assange, Bradley Manning, Edward Snowden, Aaron Swartz fought (and some died) for absolutely worthless? Offering the potential of returning the entire nation to a state of prejudice and absolute control?

There is nothing wrong with me, and you have quite clearly become somewhat upset and made some wild assumptions about what I'm saying, painting me to be an all-or-nothing kind of person without any sense of moderation, which is quite untrue. I was merely speaking in extreme examples, and furthermore examples that have actually happened in other nations due to increased surveillance and censorship which go hand in hand with destruction of civil liberties and freedom as a result of the silent obedient consent of the people, and more often than not completely without even asking them - which I think is a big part of the debate as far as UK and US surveillance matters go. I did not make any mention of ""jack-booted thugs killing your children"" and I think you're showing yourself to be a little unstable and sensationalist.

In asking me to follow my own advice and think for one second - I think it's clear that I have done so and have researched both sides of the argument, however I can't say that this appears to be true of your position. Nobody made any mention of oversight being analogous to dystopia, you have once again leapt to a biased and unsound conclusion based on pure assumption, reading far too much into a statement of extreme examples.

The ultimate point, to reiterate once again, is that we have to be very careful about allowing the people who supposedly look after the best interests of a nation and it's people to have too much power. The historical examples are myriad and almost endless. Turkey has come to a head precisely because of this kind of surveillance, Russia has had it for decades. The government are sympathetic to the lobbying executives and peerages and favours are passed around, lordships handed out, and backs are scratched - to a certain degree the media reports what it's told to, or what is safe to report - evidence? How come we never heard anything about Iceland kicking out their banksters and their government?

Does that make driving without tax or insurance ok? No it doesn't, people should make sure they get that stuff sorted in advance, but LIFE happens to people and you can't justify spying on everyone to make sure they're behaving all the time for that reason. It's not democratic to propose oversight and surveillance when the citizens do not require it and do not demand it. It would be a very different scenario if a referendum was cast and everyone was able to vote as to whether or not we would like to set up the internet police, but that hasn't happened and it's being forced upon people without their consent, and THAT isn't fair - the thing that worries me is that you're really actually ok with the government making your decisions for you, and that you feel that they know what's best for you and should in some areas of policy be given absolute power to govern you as they see fit, not as you see fit. How long until they say ""we know this guy is the best leader, we don't need you to tick the boxes, we'll just pick for you"" and you just carry on playing with your balls and watching TV saying ""yeah man, that's cool with me, just do what you gotta do...Britains Got Talent is on"".

true,Aries2203,England,2009 CBR125R (Maxine),"I ride a CBR125 but I'm pretty sure they are the same bike, just different fairing. You can buy other tyres for the wheels (I recently had to replace mine and found out what tyres were available), you can get Michelin, Bridgestone and Dunlop tyres for the CBR125 and therefore the CBF. I didn't go for those because the garage I went to (Clevedon Motorcycles w00t) weren't able to get a complete pair of those, the Conti's were the only ones that came as a complete set. The Conti go's are a budget tyre so they're not going to be amazing, but I have never had a problem with them. I find them reliable in the wet and brilliant in the dry. It all depends on what you are expecting from them, if you are expecting the tyres to grip like the more expensive ones then of course they won't feel as reliable. Also the wheels are that size because of the bike you are riding, they are proportioned to the bike. And the bike is wobbly cos it's so damned light.

With regards to your brakes, have you had them bled lately? After getting mine back from a service I was almost thrown off the first time I braked as they were so responsive. 

The engine is fine for city riding, I can beat most cars off the line and at lower speeds the acceleration isn't a problem. Getting the bike up to 70mph is a little tricky (impossible up a hill) but it's a 125, it was never going to be super fast or have amazing acceleration. If you want to get the most from her, you have to rag it. I find the most reliable way to get to 70 is to not change gear until just before she redlines.

Your riding experience partly comes down to what you are expecting from the bike. If you are expecting something that handles perfectly and goes fast then you're on the wrong sized bike. For someone like a beginner (me), I think it's a great little bike. She's goes more than fast enough for me, I'm still learning so I don't need a bike that can exceed the max speed limit. Going round corners is awesome. I have complete confidence in her when I go round a corner, and the tyres grip fine. The only thing that lacks in confidence sometimes is me.

The main point of a 125 is for beginners to learn how to ride, you can make mistakes on a 125 that would get you hurt on a larger bike.",0,1371214276,null,0,1371214727,0,cair2jr,t3_1g5mne,t1_cair2jr,t1_cagyqz9,null,1430812472,0,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,0

Benteke, the youngest, is 22(become 23), Strootman is 23 and Abameyang is 23(becomes 24). All in the most ideal age for us to purchase them. They are old enough to have some experience from a lower level, but also old enough to last some season and evolve hopefully to better players.

Benteke might be a one season wonder, and I would certainly not be disappointing if we got any of your more certain strikers that you suggested. But physically he is a perfect mach for us.

Strootman is one of the most safest prospect right now IMO. He is capped for the Dutch national team, and is expected to one of their main players in the future. I'm not 100 % sure if he would take a first 11 spot in favor of Holtby, but I think he would. The best about getting him though, is that he would give us depth in the midfield, one of our weakest point last season. He would work as a defensive cover for Sandro and Dembélé, and his playmaker abilities is needed in this squad. I think having two (or three) young prospect in midfield fighting for a last spot  would be good for them and us. A more certain player in this position might be Cabaye or Nianggolan.

The last one is Aubemayang. He is might be the most unsure of thees player. But I think given his physic and his combined goal and assist stats of around 50 over two season, he could easily outperform most of our player in the front 3 (except Bale), even if his stats are form Ligue 1.

true,[deleted],null,null,"1. He has adapted very well to the kind of football played in the UCL. In a few EPL games, he has sometimes looked a bit perplexed as to his role. This is often the case when he gets shunted out onto the wing.

2. He is a young lad, with good stamina and a good support group which means fatigue will come from the right sources and not boozing or partying or late nights. Of course, he should play less - but I don't think he is stretched to any point of danger right now.

3. I think he can be our next Lampard. Enough said?

4. Is AMC his preferred position though? When he plays for Brazil, and is deployed centrally, his game is very different. His link up play starts *deep*, and he covers much more ground *with the ball* than he does for us. It is not unusual for Oscar to start and finish an attack for Brazil. 
I agree on the central part, he is so well-rounded that he does quite well on the wing - but his main talent is, as most coaches are quick to point out, his intelligence. It is his intelligence which enables him to get so many interceptions despite a slight build. Ultimately it will be his intelligence that will differentiate him from the other, more traditionally gifted midfielders. If we stick with 4-2-3-1, then he should play in the pivot and be given more responsibility *with the ball*.

5. I don't want to say we are misusing him right now, but if we continue to see him as another playmaker in the mould of Mata and Hazard, then he will not compete - he won't develop into the type of player that he can be.
Thing is, I think he is smart enough and has a good enough group around him for that scenario to be foreseeable and he'll be outta here in no time. I just hope that won't be the case.",0,1371214820,null,0,false,0,cair6ss,t3_1gbz4d,t1_cair6ss,t3_1gbz4d,null,1430812417,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

You objected to that - not a specific policy, but the very principle that anyone should ever attempt to determine what people do online, in any capacity. 

You spun ridiculous, paranoid fantasies from this - again, from the mere idea that people should not be able to do absolutely anything without someone noticing. *Nothing* you have posted has been reasoned - you have consistently and belligerently failed to distinguish between the idea that the internet should not be completely unwatched, and the death of democracy. 

In every comment, I gave you the opportunity to make that distinction, and each time you refused: you refused to admit any middle ground between lawless internet and a totalitarian plot.

There are only two possibilities then - firstly, you genuinely can't tell the difference between a principle, and the worst excesses possible that pay lip service to the principle, and that you genuinely think everyone is out to get you. 

That would be insane.

And secondly, you do understand that supporting the idea that the internet should not be totally unwatched is completely different to supporting the rapid erosion of civil liberties, and are cynically misrepresenting the argument and poisoning discourse.

true,thunderingblue,BR,brazil,"I believe he is still adapting to the PL but in European competitions his performances were overall better. I think he had a great first season, seeing as it was his first campaign outside of Brazil. By the end of next season I think he will have a much better understanding of the pace and style of the PL.

Rest certainly can't hurt him at all. He didn't let the influx of fixtures get to him. He coped well considering he's played more matches than anyone in Europe. I wouldn't expect him to comeback leaps and bounds better, but I think he'll be sharper in his play.

I think Oscar has tremendous potential. If he continues to get playing time and stays healthy he could become one of the better players in the world. In his last 7 matches for the Selecao he's won man of the match in each of them. 

Could he become better than Mata? That is a tough one.. In my opinion I think he can (that's not a slight on Mata, just I think Oscar has the potential to be one of the greats). Only time will tell though. He could make a move to the pivot, as I think he's the most well rounded of our attacking mids. I don't think the right wing suits him, but he has to be on the field. 

In just the last year Oscar has gone from scoring his first goal for Brazil, to be one of the first names on the team sheet. I really think he could become of the best players in the world. Never getting close to the ridiculous stats of Ronaldo or Messi, but I think he could become a star. I also think between Mata, Hazard, and Oscar, that Oscar will have the longest tenure at the club. Just a hunch.

I can't wait to see him and the rest of the lads play under Mourinho. If Jose really does bring stability to the club, I think Oscar could become part of the backbone of the squad (a la Lamps).

If the employees were paid a higher basic wage, that would be factored into the price of the meal but then customers would be tipping less, if at all.   I would suggest that the lower cost of restaurant meals in the US vs the UK is the result of several factors working together, not just the tipping culture.  For example, the US agricultural lobby is very active in ~~bribing~~ persuading the US government into offering large subsidies to the industry.

There are other issues that come in to play, as well.  As the article suggests, white employees tend to be tipped more generously than black employees.  I am also willing to bet that female employees are tipped more generously than male employees.  That kind of discrimination cannot (legally) occur through the pay packet, but is an inevitable consequence of tipping.  Allowing your employees' wages to be determined by their popularity with your customers is extremely regressive.

Also, restaurants on both sides of the Atlantic are notorious for further exploiting their employees by using their tips to make up the minimum wage, or by demanding that the manager/restaurant takes a cut.

Sativa (high) and Indica (stoned).

I personally think the best argument for full legalisation is damage reduction.  People are taking drugs anyway and the prohibition is doing more harm than the drugs themselves.

true,bluecon,null,null,"1) I think his performance since coming to England has had few faults. His positioning, vision, and technical skills are fantastic for his age and even better than other players. He needs to buff up and perhaps work on his defense.

2) With some quality rest and some attention from a new manager there is absolutely no reason he shouldn't get better next season.

3) Predicting the future is always tricky. He came into the team and performed admirably. I am hoping that it wasn't beginner's luck and with the right attitude and training he will continue to improve. There are games where he absolutely controls the field for 90 minutes but there is the occasional game where is is anonymous. That could happen to any player of course, but I think his current potential is fantastic. After that Juventus game the sky is the limit.

4) There were a few games where we played Hazard on the LAM, Oscar in the CAM, and Mata in the RAM. This seemed to be the best use of all three as Hazard can consistently use both feet, use speed to beat defenders to get close to goal, or use tricks inside the box to move the ball around. Mata doesn't use his speed the same way and it seems he prefers to cut inside from the right so that he can use his left foot for a shot/pass and he will have the overlap from Azpil to create space. This leaves Oscar in the CAM to do what we have seen him do for Brazil and personally I believe his best games are in that position. Would moving him to CDM be a bad idea? Absolutely not. If he improves his defense and hits the weights, it could certainly benefit the team to have a playmaker in that position. Hell, it couldn't hurt.

5) First thought to put things in perspective: the kid is barely able to legally drink in the United States. Other kids his age are still in school and he has already accomplished fantastic things. If he is able to play as well as he has there is no reason he won't do well in the future. Between Mourinho and the small contingent of Brazillians I would hope he will be happy and settle in well as a consistent star.

That's not something you can guarantee and wouldn't look good when you submit your correspondence to the court.

The deadline is important. Also small claims court will take a fee starting at £30 and going up incrementally with the value of the damages sought.

I would mention that you will also recover all costs related to pursuing it through legal channels (time, fees, stationary, solicitor -if you hire one -but not necessary). Make sure to state these costs up front.

Small Claims Court is a doddle. I'd make sure to send 2 warning letters and a final one with 14 day deadlines between each (the courts appreciate when you give someone maximum opportunity to repay - they are not fans of vitriol, harassment or vehement creditors).

Once you get to SCC, you'll normally receive a judgement in 30 days after the summons has been issued (unless she opposes it); then you will get a court order and if she doesn't repay you then she'll be breaking the law.

Sums it up. I went into it expecting to see the notion of what is for a God to arrive on Earth - how humanity would react, how the ""God"" himself would react to the revelation of his true heritage, that kinda thing.

There was a bit of it, but not as much as I'd thought. So that aspect was a little disappointing. I also didn't warm to this iteration of Lois Lane, despite liking Amy Adams a great deal.

The set-pieces, however, are utterly ridiculous. This really is what'd happen if a set of Gods used Earth as a staging ground to beat the living shit out of each other. There's hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars worth of devastation, as a consequence of their fights.

I doubt very much if I'll go see it again - I enjoyed it for what it was, but I can't see me going again, nor rushing to pre-order the blu-ray.

2) Most certainly. Some rest will hopefully let him come back a lot sharper. He's earned it also.

3) I'm hesitant to say this, because I don't wanna jynx him, but I think he certainly has a lot. Personally, I think some people over estimate him in this regard, but he definitely has potential to become really good.

4) It depends how you want to describe better. I don't think he'll become a better passer in the final third, Mata's already way to good at that and hopefully still improving himself. He certainly has areas where he could surpass Mata though. As for position, it depends on what formation we play. If we stay with the 4-2-3-1 I don't think he could play the pivot.

I myself legally avoid paying tax when I can. For example, I am not required to pay tax on my savings income, so I don't.

That said, I'm obviously biased in favour of an Engineering company who provides thousands of decent jobs to all levels of skilled and less-skilled employees.

RR is one of the few remaining companies in the UK to still make manufacturing a successful core business whilst keeping our country the technological leader in many high tech aviation, marine, nuclear and power industries.

On the other hand, I am very biased against so-called ""service"" providers like investment banks (Goldman Sachs) who merely provide a few very high paying jobs to a few elites. All they do is shift digital money around, providing no real long term benefit to the majority of the people who aren't living it up with stock options and shares.

In those cases, I would not miss them at all.

In any case, I think changing the tax laws to make them pay tax in the UK isn't being mean at all, since they're still going to make a healthy profit in the UK, just a slightly smaller one.

The only apparent difference is that they've apparently been paying attention - for the last few years - to the fact that the government [routinely haemorrhages personal details on millions of citizens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UK_government_data_losses) (and that only covers the years 2007-2008), and - *empirically!* - can't secure a computer system to save their lives.

It's like having a drunk monkey in charge of a bus, and admonishing the other passengers for getting upset about it because you ""aren't worried unless the driver is inebriated or a simian"".

Ricky van Wolfswinkel is a young, talented striker who went to Norwich for only ten million euros. Even though he may not blossom to be a star, I certainly believe he will be a productive and goalscoring talent. I believe that there are center forwards to be had without spending oligarch/oilbucks money and even that we could probably have Welbeck for a decent fee if AVB and Levy value him that much.

If we are to make a solid CL run year in and year out, we will need continuity and chemistry and I think buying at least one young striker is an important component.

I've never worked for a firm which makes cold calls (AFAIK) but I can say that the telephony systems we use would not support it, and even if we spent a lot of money to let them, it wouldn't be consistant.

I don't think it's too much to ask companies to ensure their telephony system allows people to know who they are. The dodgy companies are the ones who withhold their number. If a company has an out of date system that prevents the number being sent then they can speak to BT or whoever does their phones and get it tacked on.

&gt;The thing is, none of this matters, as they would simply dial from another country, incorperating there.

It should be set up so that you can block numbers coming from other countries, specifically India, Phillipines and countries which typically do this. Many calls that come from India are already routed to the UK and dialled from the UK out. If a company wants to get around a block on Indian calls then they can simply do that, and of course they would then need to comply with UK laws so the problem is solved.

From early in its life the Admiralty itself frequently referred to the flag as the Union Jack, whatever its use, and in 1902 an Admiralty Circular announced that Their Lordships had decided that either name could be used officially.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;I don't think it's too much to ask companies to ensure their telephony system allows people to know who they are. The dodgy companies are the ones who withhold their number. If a company has an out of date system that prevents the number being sent then they can speak to BT or whoever does their phones and get it tacked on.

What about a mid-sized firm?  The kind that has maybe 30 employees and no telephony expert.  Why should they face some big operating cost, they may well have to throw away all their kit!

I haven't gone near a PABX in 10 years, but I know that it is going to be very expensive and very costly for a lot of people to do this, because I know at least one of those companies hasn't changed their system in 15 years.

Sure all the PABXs you've played with might have a simple SIP trunking rule change and presto, DDI.  There are many companies without this.

So you couldn't apply it to all businesses, you would have to try and say it is only to those making un-solicited calls.... That would be very hard to practically enforce.

Hence why things like the TPS are a better idea.  I also think trying to regulate indian call centers (which btw most telcos happily let you block international calls already!) would fail massively, because ultimately it is quite easy to cheat this with some imaginative telephone routing.  I am not by any means an expert in this field, but I can think of a dozen (highly illegal) ways of doing this without even trying.  Hell just look at the people who have been *SWATTING* in the US (the art of dialing 911 with a faked number, to get an armed swat team to raid someones home for a jape).

I'm not sure why you think they would need to throw away their kit. They just phone BT and say ""Can you tack on a number as the call id for us?"" and it's done. You could even legislate that BT/Virgin/Sky etc whoever provide business telephone numbers must provide at least one call id per billed organisation free of charge.

That way the 30 employee firm would make calls from whatever number they wanted and they would all call ID as their main inbound number.

&gt;Hence why things like the TPS are a better idea. I also think trying to regulate indian call centers 

You can't regulate Indian call centres. You just allow consumers to easily block them, and you regulate whatever is their dialler end in the UK.

&gt;I'm trying to be polite, but I think you lack knowledge of what your talking about. It simply isn't practical to do these things they suggest, without massively changing the telephone network.

Pjanic, from what I've gathered is a really terrific prospect. A passing midfielder that will surely fill that Modric sized hole in midfield, the perfect role for the 3rd member of our midfield.

We already have our stopper in Sandro, with Dembele pushing us forward with sheer power, and Pjanic would be a great passing midfielder, controlling possession and calming the team down when we're erratic. Similar to the impact Tom Carroll has on games when he comes on.

I'd be absolutely thrilled if we got him, a move like this would really show our ambition.

The only real worry is the lack of experience. We have experienced players in Defoe, Ade, Clintus Maximus and Dawson.

I think Pjanic would be a good pick up.  He is much more of a deep lying playmaker than any of the others we have, he has great vision and creativity.  He would be a nice add, we could push Dembele up further and make him more of a threat in attack, we could then rotate Holtby with Pjanic in the CM role and Dembele in the CAM role.  Siggy can fill in out on the wing and rotate at CAM as well.

edit: for anyone who's either new, or has a very, very short memory here's why Ayre has been a  disaster for Liverpool FC:

I have no idea how he ended up in the job long term. He was brought is commercial director by H&amp;G in 2007, and to be groomed into the new chairman. A token scouser, for some of the worst owners in professional football history. To give him his due, he did some good work for the Standard Chartered shirt deal, but, why is H&amp;G's man still running the club? I don't understand. FSG said they wanted to appoint their own man, and have done so in almost every other aspect of the club, except for the most important nonfootball role, that's just bizarre.

Now let's look at his record: He was promoted in March 2011, assumably he worked with Comolli closely during that summer, that went well. The Suarez-Evra incident happened under his watch too, but who always had to speak publically about it? Dalglish, not Ayre. Not only did the club repeatedly shoot itself in the foot under his leadership, but he hung the manager out to dry in front of the press too. Furthermore, during this period communication between him and FSG was so bad that (I can't remember who exactly) they had to read about the story still going on in the US press.

Fastforward to August 2012, we loan out our record signing and leave ourselves with 2 forwards for 3 months. That's on his watch too, why'd he sign off the Carroll deal knowing FSG weren't willing to up the deal for Dempsey? Again, he left the manager to look a prick in the aftermath, Ayre was nowhere.

Add to that, he let Being: Liverpool happen, without proper editing. That film made him, the manager and the club look like utter tits. How can you let that film be broadcast as it was: the motorbike thing, the portrait in Rodgers house, the Joe Allen 69 thing etc, etc... No other club in the world would let their club be represented like that. 

And finally, he rubs other club MDs the wrong way all the time (Whelan, Gartside and others). That's not part of his job, just shut up Ayre.

&gt;Liverpool Council leaders clinched the £13m deal to buy Everton FC’s training ground just weeks before it could have ended up being taken over by the Government.

&gt;The company that owned Finch Farm was at risk of being struck off and dissolved by the end of next  month, the ECHO can reveal.

&gt;If that had happened, the Halewood site would have been taken from Finch Farm Ltd and put into Treasury coffers.

&gt;Treasury sources said, if that had happened, the Government would then have looked to sell it off.

&gt;But a Goodison insider confirmed Everton’s lease would have been secure even if this had taken place.

&gt;Concerns about the future of the 55-acre site grew as Finch Farm Ltd, previously known as ROM Capital (Academy) Ltd, failed to file accounts in January this year. They have still not been filed, and its annual return, due on April 27, is also still outstanding.

&gt;Three days later, the Registrar of Companies applied to have the company dissolved, so all assets would have gone to the Crown.

&gt;So far, no application to keep the company trading has been received.

&gt;Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson said it was important that the council helped the club where it could. He said the outlay on the deal, which has been bankrolled by borrowing at low interest rates, would be recouped in rent from the Blues.

&gt;Everton is in a long-term lease deal with the council and will have to pay the deal’s value – and more – back to the council in the long term. The ECHO understands they will end up paying double the amount borrowed by the council, but in smaller instalments over a longer period than under the deal with Finch Farm Ltd.

&gt;But, while opposition figures have questioned why the council is paying £13m for a site that the club sold to ROM Capital for just £2m, Mayor Anderson explained that the deal would still turn a profit when sold for the council.

&gt;He said: “Whatever the deal Everton did for the land, what we’ve got now is a complex that has infrastructure and buildings.

&gt;“Whether the value of the land has increased I don’t know, but there’s no way we would have paid anything without it being valued properly. It went past the District Auditor.”

&gt;No-one from Finch Farm Ltd could be contacted for comment but one of its directors, entrepreneur Robert David Whitton, was last in the headlines in 2008 when his £3bn property investment fund aAim, which boasted Sir David Frost as its chairman, collapsed into administration.

&gt;It ranked among its backers Sir Alex Ferguson and former TV presenter Anthea Turner’s husband Grant Bovey.

&gt;Mr Whitton became involved with the company that went on to become Finch Farm Ltd in 2006, and Everton moved in in 2007.

&gt;Council Lib Dem opposition leader Cllr Richard Kemp said more detail was needed on how the council had made the decision: “We need to know what the social and economic benefits are.

&gt;“If we are to make a profit from it, then we need to see report and there needs to be proper scrutiny of how the council thinks it can make a success of this.”

&gt;Club chief executive Robert Elstone has so far publicly said that “we continue to work with the council on many fronts and the club is especially pleased to have delivered an innovative scheme, on our superb Finch Farm facility, that works for both parties.”

&gt;An Everton source said: “Finch Farm Ltd was nothing to do with Everton. That’s all in the past now and we’ve reached a situation that works.”

----

The Finch Farm ltd company is being left to be closed because their only asset was sold. The article makes it sound like Finch Farm was going to be under government control before being resold. It was on the market since 2011 and LCC had been in talks for months about buying it.

The article does not mention that it had £8m worth of work put into it after being sold for £2m.

It suggests Everton are paying around £590k a year, down from £1.5m by saying Everton are paying double what the council paid over the course of the remaining lease (44yrs). When it's common knowledge that Liverpool Council have borrowed and will be renting back at a higher percentage to make a profit - otherwise why would the Council borrow for Everton's sake if it eats into their own revenue streams.

It brings up that Liverpool City Council's opposition Lib Dem councillor saying that he is out of the loop and wants to look at a costs and benefit analysis.

Right, no. For a start, I have no idea how he ended up in the job long term. He was brought is commercial director by H&amp;G in 2007, and to be groomed into the new chairman. A token scouser, for some of the worst owners in professional football history. To give him his due, he did some good work for the Standard Chartered shirt deal, but, why is H&amp;G's man still running the club? I don't understand. FSG said they wanted to appoint their own man, and have done so in almost every other aspect of the club, except for the most important nonfootball role, that's just bizarre.

Now let's look at his record: He was promoted in March 2011, assumably he worked with Comolli closely during that summer, that went well. The Suarez-Evra incident happened under his watch too, but who always had to speak publically about it? Dalglish, not Ayre. Not only did the club repeatedly shoot itself in the foot under his leadership, but he hung the manager out to dry in front of the press too. Furthermore, during this period communication between him and FSG was so bad that (I can't remember who exactly) they had to read about the story still going on in the US press.

Fastforward to August 2012, we loan out our record signing and leave ourselves with 2 forwards for 3 months. That's on his watch too, why'd he sign off the Carroll deal knowing FSG weren't willing to up the deal for Dempsey? Again, he left the manager to look a prick in the aftermath, Ayre was nowhere.

Add to that, he let Being: Liverpool happen, without proper editing. That film made him, the manager and the club look like utter tits. How can you let that film be broadcast as it was: the motorbike thing, the portrait in Rodgers house, the Joe Allen 69 thing etc, etc... No other club in the world would let their club be represented like that. 

And finally, he rubs other club MDs the wrong way all the time (Whelan, Gartside and others). That's not part of his job, just shut up Ayre.

And he's always in all the photos in a stupid fucking shirt.

&gt; Since he is our chief negotiator getting rid of him now would be a massive setback in current dealings and gives us another, more important position to fill over the summer.

Rumours have gone around for a few weeks about Billy Hogan being lined up as his replacement. At the very least FSG should have somebody in mind. They should never have given him the promotion.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"as a radio 4 listener and a cyclists Id like to take a stab at answering that...

no...yes....maybe.

Here's the thing - listening to music/podcasts  while cycling many would argue (myself inc) that its no less dangerous/or a distraction than listening to the radio in your car with the windows up. In fact, Id say compared to the noise blocked out by driving/radio listening I would say a cyclist still hears more with headphones in than as a car driver does in his car.

When I mention this someone will say - ""yes but you're on a bike, you should be more aware because of the dangers to you"". To which I would reply...

Thats is victim blaming. A car driver should be in control of your vehicle, if we agree that the volume of the radio is as much as distraction to you as a me, then really you shouldn't be driving with the radio on. Otherwise you are simply saying that the distraction is okay for the driver and not a cyclist. Some will say, but yes, I'm protected in my car. I would say you are in a car, introducing a real danger, there is more of a need for you to stay alert than a cyclists who pose a very low threat to the public/road users.

Now, that said its more complex than that.

its socially acceptable to drive with the radio on, with the windows up, and some cars block out so much noise Im surprised they are even legal. But, there have been a few cases where a cyclist has been hit or killed while wearing headphone - This is practically an excuse to get away with hitting a cyclist.. In some cases the jury has deemed this a negative thing. Of course (my opinion) this is total hypocrisy and looks to find faults with the cyclist while not applying those same faults to the driver.

Anyway....Heres what I do. I personally take the middle ground. I listen with one ear in, and one free. I set my Iphone to mono and that's good enough for me.",0,1371242886,null,0,false,0,caj111t,t3_1gbvok,t1_caj111t,t1_caiyv1j,null,1430807637,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6
true,R4vendarksky,null,null,"Okay so it sounds like you have a great holiday planned! Skye is an amazing place, one of the best places in the entire world to hillwalk. If you are a confident walker and not afraid of a bit of exposure then I highly recommend going hill walking. If you aren't that experienced then it may be worth splashing out some money on a guide and getting up into the hills anyway. It really is some of the most stunning walking/scrambling/climbing that can be done anywhere. Personally I would stay in Syke and not bother with lewis. Do you have stuff booked or is it a rough itinerary? I have family from Lewis but don't find it to be that exciting a place although the coastline is stunning. 

Anyway, to answer your questions:

1) Fair enough, you don't like the brewdog stuff. Personally I don't find it great to have more than one drink of... BUT it is the most exciting thing coming out of scotland at the moment in terms of the international market. Some more well rounded drinks can be found from the Cairngorm brewery, their tour is pretty good, just don't expect to be driving afterwards! http://www.cairngormbrewery.com/index.php. It IS a little out of your way though :(... but the reason I mention it is you can probably pick up some of their beers in and around Edinburgh. If you are going to try william bros stuff then you can get it really cheaply in ALDI (supermarket) http://www.williamsbrosbrew.com/ . Personally they don't make my favourite craft beers but they do have a big name for themselves and they sell well in fashionable bars around the capital.

2) Scotland has a problem with record shops, most of the good independant ones I know about have shut down. I'm no expert though and I suggest heading over to /r/Glasgow and asking there... the music scene is better in Glasgow so I'd imagine the best shops are there.

3) I know nothing about this.

4) personally I don't smoke at all but I know people who do and it can be readily obtained in Edinburgh/Glasgow. I would advise NOT asking online about it and also NOT asking on gumtree about it, people get ripped off on there. DEFINITELY DO NOT TRY AND BRING YOUR OWN. I would suggest asking people in nightclubs once you are here, but be aware that bouncers in Glasgow regularly search people... you should be fine in Edinburgh.",0,1371242886,null,0,false,0,caj111v,t3_1gcqo1,t1_caj111v,t3_1gcqo1,null,1430807637,2,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,2

I must add, I'm not saying that Carrick is shit but I think we can all agree who we'd rather have now in hind sight.

He had subdued seasons with us at first, he didnt really take off until Mou came along to be honest, which is probably why whenever Frank talks about Jose it's always in the highest regard.

I think it's a vicious circle.  Americans know that waiting staff are poorly paid and depend on their tips to survive.  So they tip generously because they have to (not legally ""have to"", but through social pressure, or because they don't want 3rd party bodily fluids in their food).

Instead the restaurant should put the prices up by 20% and pay the staff properly.  If a customer wants to leave a tip as something *extra* then they can, but it shouldn't be ""obligatory"" (technically it's not at present, but in practice it is).

Apart from anything else, it's a hidden charge.  If a meal costs £20 + £4 tip then it should be advertised as £24.

&gt; I believe tips are taxed income in America

I believe you're right. Furthermore, I read that they're taxed on the assumption that they make $7.25 an hour including tips, even if they don't actually make those tips.

I'd personally wouldn't expect American actors to be up to snuff. The closest would be Johnny Depp, but about a decade ago. Lately, he's really been 'Johnny Depp, as' in execution. 

Now there are some voice actors I think would be possible material, but there is the question of if they have presence in an acting environment. Two examples would be Vic Mignogna and Johnny Yong Bosch, two voice actors who have moved back and forth to characters bordering on insane, to serious characters. But while Bosch has limited acting, I don't honestly think that anyone not RAISED on Doctor Who really knows how The Doctor moves, when an actor plays as him. So I think honestly it'll be another decade before anyone who could be a possible Doctor could come America.

BUT! It's the only acting region I'm familiar with, being American, without a lot of experience with outside media. There may me an amazing actor in the EU, waiting in the wings, and for the chance to become an amazing Doctor, though I doubt BBC would do that.

true,KaiserMacCleg,,,"In the short term Wales would be operating at a deficit. There's no point beating around the bush about that as a supporter of independence; it's just fact that at present, total public expenditure in Wales is greater than the total revenue through tax. Therefore I do not doubt that borrowing, as in almost every other corner of the Western World (including the rest of the UK) would be key to financing Wales as an independent state, in the short term at least. In the long run, of course, we'd have to increase the tax take, which means growing the economy.

The question is just how big the deficit is. I've heard estimates ranging from £6 bn to £18 bn - it just doesn't seem to be clear at the moment, and won't be until the WG starts publishing more detailed analyses of the Welsh economy. I suspect the size of the Welsh deficit is usually overestimated, given how the amount of tax raised in the UK is recorded - corporation tax is recorded as having been raised from the area where the company's HQ is based, rather than where the wealth is actually generated. As Wales has a dearth of HQs, the figure is inevitably lower here than it is elsewhere.

If what you're asking is actually more along the lines of what the Welsh economy would be based on, well, the answer is what it is based on now: it would be an export-oriented economy. Manufacturing's still big in Wales, despite appearances, and we have a healthy trade surplus at the moment. The energy sector is another big potential exporter, given the coming UK energy crisis and Wales' highly developed energy infrastructure. Tourism plays a peripheral role, and there is potential for improvement in that sector - if Cardiff Airport gets back on its feet.

true,KaiserMacCleg,,,"&gt;First would be the economic downfall from turning away from one of the world's strongest economies. The pound, even though its value has declined in recent years, is stronger than the EU or USD. Economically it does not make sense.

Why the predictions of doom?

Independence does not mean economic isolation; an independent Wales would inevitably remain highly integrated, economically speaking, with the rest of the UK. There is no doubt as to who our main trading partner would be. 

Do not confuse the strength of currencies with the strength of economies. The two things are quite distinct and a highly valued currency is not always a good thing. As an exporting economy, Wales would probably benefit from a devaluation in the £,  just as Japan and China benefit from their own low value currencies - a low value currency means that goods produced by a country are cheaper to import elsewhere, making manufacturing in that country more competitive. In any case, independence does not necessarily mean an end to currency union. The favoured option of the SNP in Scotland is to retain stirling, if the 2014 vote goes their way. Of course, that would entail negotiation with the rUK were that every to happen.

My support for independence is based primarily on economic grounds. Frankly, the country's a fucking mess, and it's been getting worse, relative to the rest of the UK, ever since the war. Whatever magic is supposed to come with being a part of one of the largest economies in the world is plainly not doing the trick here. I'd argue that it's doing the opposite, in fact; a flat corporation tax rate country-wide and a chronic underinvestment in infrastructure away from the overheated core of London and the South-East make it impossible for the peripheral areas of the UK, Wales included, to compete in attracting the needed investment and jobs.

Since you don't provide any other insight to why you think he's doing a good job, what else was I supposed to say, really. So really I'm all up for a discussion here, but I just get downvoted for a post which was largely informative, with a few jokes thrown in. There are a lot of people on this subreddit with very very short memories, and a lot who think that criticising the owners or the club management is some sort of treason. They'd rather we just discussed signing players we aren't even linked with.

Replacing Ayre would never be a sudden thing, or at least it shouldn't. The owners should have a replacement in mind, and in Billy Hogan, I think they do (from what I've read, I have no idea if he's good at his job, or Ayre's job). You're right that now is a bad time, although like I've said before, it should have been a long time ago. I suspect if Hogan is the next MD he'll either assume the role in September or next year.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Interesting read, but I suspect that this will be a non-starter for several important reasons;

* It is easier politically to harm young students since their union is little more than a toothless childrens debating club and because students don't typically vote in a co-ordinated enough way to influence policy... however the 25-35 year olds this would target **do** tend to vote - and a policy like this could significantly influence the long term prospects of the party that introduced it. 

* It would almost certainly be subject to repeated legal challenge (which may or may not be sucessful).

* Applying the changes retrospectively would probably prove unworkably complex. Consider this example -- Mr A took out a £25K student loan in 2004 and has paid it down already with his decent earnings. Mr B also took out the same £25K loan in 2004, but his repayments have only covered the interest accrued due to his low wage. So... he would have to pay even more despite having taken out the same loan with the same T&amp;Cs... it would be a tax on poor graduates, while those wealthy ones that have paid down their loans would walk away free.

* On a similar line to the above point... they would also have to decide how far back to go -- To the pre-2006 days when students paid £1200 pa fees? To the pre-2012 days of £3000 fees? To the pre-1998 introduction of any fees? Any choice (except to implement them for every graduate alive) would effectively be arbitrary, making this even harder to sell to the public.

* Because tuition fees of any sort are relatively new (the oldest person paying any tuition fees would only have graduated 12 years ago), it would specifically target the already beleaguered 25-35 age range. These people are important for the economy as they are typically the most productive age group and their ability to spend is important... taking more cash out of their pockets when most are already shelling out excessive amounts on rent/cost of living vs low wages and high unemployment would be extremely counter productive.

* Since virtually all graduates that this would affect are already paying down their loans at 9% of income over £17K, the economic benefits of it would not actually be felt for many years (as it would essentially prolong the length of time they pay, but not the size of the repayments)... so why would a government today introduce something so politically damaging when it would only benefit a subsequent government 10-15 years down the line. It just wouldn't make sense.

**Tl;dr:** Scary as it is, I doubt this will happen. Implementing it would be so frought with complexity and so politically devastating to whoever introduced it that I doubt the income it could generate would justify the political costs.",0,1371248329,null,0,1371248950,0,caj2uv6,t3_1gc5d1,t1_caj2uv6,t3_1gc5d1,null,1430806775,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

true,KaiserMacCleg,,,"&gt;Yes, there are a lot of poor and low income families in Wales, particularly in the north. What real industry do we have to rely on for income from exports? Coal? That dinosaur is hastily becoming extinct along with what little oil there is off the coast.

For data on exports look here:

https://statswales.wales.gov.uk/Catalogue/Business-Economy-and-Labour-Market/Businesses/Exports/ValueOfWelshExports-by-Quarter-Product

The biggest export sectors (Q1 2013) are as follows:


Machinery and transport equipment £1.22 bn

Minerals, fuels, lubricants etc. £1.03 bn

Manufactured goods £0.54 bn

Chemicals and related products £0.35 bn

Miscellaneous manufactured goods £0.22 bn


With exports totaling £3.47 bn that quarter. Wales currently operates at a substantial trade surplus, as you can see [here](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/RTS/Pages/default.aspx).

There never was any oil off the Welsh coast. There's a gas and condensate rig in the Irish Sea to the north of Wales but I don't know whether that would fall within the economic zone of an independent Wales or not. I doubt it somehow - it's a long way out (EDIT: [Looks like I was wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Complex)). More likely it'd fall within the waters of the rUK or the Isle of Man. In terms of fossil fuels, there's limited potential for fracking in the Vale of Glamorgan and Pembrokeshire, open cast mining for coal in the valleys (still ongoing at Ffos y Fran by Merthyr), and coal bed methane. Nothing too dramatic and nothing that I'd be keen to see exploited. In terms of energy more generally, however, Wales could quite happily export some of that which it produces - it does now, after all - and the potential for renewable energy in Wales is huge.",0,1371248398,null,0,1371248886,0,caj2vn6,t3_1g9etp,t1_caj2vn6,t1_caigct5,null,1430806765,4,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,4

Wheras enemy of the world is a pile of utter shit and the only surprise that might save it is if it turns out patrick troughton does some really brilliant eyebrow acting.

Also, many stories have one episode left or are just missing one, so we have an even better idea of what to expect.

This is absolutely right. As cyclists we're the ones that get killed, while drivers are protected by a big metal box. Then again it's not unreasonable to take measures such as not having both earphones in while riding somewhere that motor vehicles are dominant. Much the same way in which women take precautions when out walking at night that many men don't even consider. It's not fair on them, but the society is such that it is seen as necessary.

It was in the right place, the right size, the right price per month, came furnished (which we were looking for as we were starting out together). Landlord was flexible enough to meet our needs and he got a really good vibe from them. The estate agents wanted **£2200** in fees (£400 each for a credit check and general admin, £150 each for reference checks, then a months rent deposit AND a month in advance) which was just astronomical. We walked away.


Two months later, we'd all but given up our flat search to live with each other and my boyfriend was looking on one of those 'rooms for rent' websites so that he could move in somewhere sharpish as his contract in his current place was finishing. On there he noticed that someone had put a one bedroom flat in the area we wanted to live in within our budget. Arranged a viewing immediately. Got there and my BF turned to me and went... we're taking it. It was exactly the same flat. Apart from this time, there was no estate agent and the couple who owned it were renting it through themselves.


Moved in two weeks later. When we were drawing up the contract we chatted about it and they'd had the flat on the market for nearly 5 months!! without any serious interest. They kept having people coming to look, loving it, then not taking it. Their jaws hit the floor when they found out how much the estate agents were trying to take off of people.

Soon all the rugby fans had shuffled out and the football heads had started filing into the pub. The bar staff's dress code was a black shirt with black suit pants.

Suddenly the atmosphere had changed. I went for a smoke to calm the nerves, and at this point I was certain Bayern had won it. After my smoke, I walk back into the bar and I see THE header. The whole pub starts booing because the majority of Irish people are Man Utd fans, and they'd come to gloat at the Chelsea's inevitable loss. I went fucking mental and started dancing. What a feeling! The manager tells me to get back to work, so I carry on, all the while keeping an eye on the big screen. When it comes to penalties I take my 30 minute break and sit myself in front of the screen with the other Chelsea fan I work with. We all know what happens next.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"Question Time is in my opinion actually destructive of political debate, because it is so shallow. Each programme, you have something like 6 questions, and 5 panellists, who each get their turn on every question. It is rare for panellists to be able to come back to each others' points, because the chairman always wants to move on to the next question. In sum, that means it's a perfect opportunity for politicians to trot out the party line, without having to discuss the topics enough to reveal whether or not they actually have any knowledge whatsoever of what they're talking about. It is actively destructive, because it gives the impression that a debate is occurring, or indeed that this is what political debate should look like, but in fact it is mostly a broadcast opportunity for politicians.

That is why they invite comedians on rather than scientists, because comedians are good at pithy soundbites, and the necessity for pithy soundbites is built into the structure of the show. There is no time for the boring details, or anything approaching a rigorous assessments of the facts.

The only time Question Time has been worthwhile, from my memory, is when they had the episode just after the London riots, and the whole show was dedicated to that one topic. There was a real sense that a meaningful discussion had occurred, and progress had been made. As far as I know, that has never been repeated.

1) It is explicitly written into the student loan contracts that they can alter the repayment in any way they wish. That doesn't make them immune from legal challenge but it does help.

3) In general the current government is fairly happy to shit on the 25-35 y/o range because to put it simply none of us vote for them.

4) The change would simply be in interest accumulation rate and would effect anyone with an outstanding pre-2012 student loan. They wouldn't need to decide who gets affected, everyone does.

5) Do we really feel the current government is above targeting the poorer members of society?

Yes, it's totally ridiculous that we're spending a fortune on having police standing outside the embassy, but that's what governments do. It's worth more to us in goodwill and international respect that we act gentlemanly and British about it. 

It might be costing us £3m a year for us to keep police outside that embassy, securing Assange inside it - that is basically £3m a year contributed to the security of our own embassies abroad.

true,Kuusou,null,null,"I have had a few thoughts about this one.

I have said many times, even on here, that I believe the doctor is FAR older than he says. Even during the seasons we watch he ages quite a lot. I think Amy said something about them being with the doctor for 10 years on and off. I think she meant that she was 10 years older than she should be, but I guess I could have misunderstood. We obviously didn't watch them for 10 years, and when he tells us his age, sometimes it seems to be based at least a little bit on how many years pass for us, or for the shows run, and not based on what is going on in the show. For instance, 9 states he is 900 years old, while 11 states he is 907. Am I really to believe that 9-11 really only happened over 7 years of the doctors life?

And he goes off to do things without other people all of the time, even between episodes or during episodes, where it looks like it's been a day, but it's been at least several for him. Think about times like when he watched Clara grow up, something he does in between traveling from one day to the next day, and in the same episode. So it looks like one day to Clara, and we only see parts of it. He could have spent YEARS doing that. And to him, he wouldn't even notice it.

These are just a few simple examples. Things like erasing yourself from history would take a considerable amount of time and I believe the doctor aged at least a few hundred years doing that one.

I personally believe that he is 10s of thousands of years old, or at least 10+ thousand years old.

All of that being said. I don't think he is telling his age in terms of EARTHS SUN going around THE EARTH. I mean, why would he. He must be using a different system. At the very least he would be using the Galifrayen calender, something we don't know anything about.

true,obvsthisisathrowaway,null,null,"**Phone**: if you're on Verizon or Sprint, your phone may only support CDMA networks - so it won't work in the UK. AT&amp;T and T-Mobile should be fine, as the UK uses GSM (as well as 3G and HSPA). Luckily, owning a phone here is super-cheap. If your phone works over here, you should just be able to go into any phone shop (Three, O2, Vodafone, Orange, T-Mobile, EE) and ask for a PAYG (pay as you go) SIM. A lot of these come pre-loaded with some allowance, and you can top the credit up to get more calls/texts/data. For example [£10 at Three](http://www.three.co.uk/Store/SIM/Pay_As_You_Go) gets you 500MB of data, 100 mins and 3000 texts for a month. £5 more gets you unlimited data and 200 more minutes.

You may want to get a PAYG plan designated as 'international' if you want to call home, as this will massively reduce the cost of doing so. An example of this is the [Vodafone International SIM](https://freesim.vodafone.co.uk/international-sim-card?tracker=3sY5Ve) - by topping up £15 you will get 100 free international minutes plus £15 of credit to spend on further calls/texts/data (where texts are 12p, minutes 25p). Alternatively, the [O2 International SIM](http://www.o2.co.uk/international/intsim) will let you contact the USA for 4p/min, 10p/text. If you top up £15 of credit, you get 100MB of data free and then the £15 to spend on calls/texts/data (25p/min, 12p/text). [T-Mobile](http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/shop/free-international-sim-cards/) has a similar offer.

If you need a temporary phone to use while you're here, just go into a few phone shops and look for the cheapest phone you'd be willing to use. Check with the staff that it's unlocked and you should just be able to pop any SIM into it and go. If you find a company with both a cheap phone and PAYG SIM that you want, you should be able to get both together, maybe cheaper.

**Alcohol**: Sainsbury's on Sidney Street will be closest and cheapest. Gardies on Rose Crescent is fairly obligatory for a late night kebab.

**Socialising**: I'm sure you'll meet people where you're staying quickly enough. After about June 25th, almost every student at the university will have gone home for the summer, but there'll probably still be a few people around to socialise with. I guess the best place to do so is probably pubs. The Maypole is fine, and I've heard The Bath House is too. The clubs in Cambridge are awful and will be empty at this time of year. God I hate clubs. Music or theatre (mentioned lots of places in my original post) might be options too. At this time of year the nightlife probably won't be that representative of what it's normally like in Cambridge.

**ID**: I really don't know how accepted an ISIC would be. My NUS Extra card is also an ISIC, but I've never tried to use it anywhere.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; You're basically saying that a foreign embassy should be treated purely as foreign soil within the native country?

Yes, exactly.

It's what embassies are all about. 

This ensures that diplomatic officials can't be bullied by the host country, and they can do their jobs properly - protecting their citizens whilst abroad and negotiating trade and stuff.

And because the host country designates the embassy as foreign territory this way, it demonstrates trust - that foreign countries can trust Britain to keep our word.

I'm pretty sure that when we declared war on Germany, it would have been our ambassador that delivered the news to Adolf. He would have delivered the news that we were at war, and then be allowed to peacefully pack his bags and depart on a neutral ship (or via Switzerland).

&gt; If Hague was invited into the Ecuadorian embassy however, if he under Ecuadorian law?

Theoretically, yes, I believe so.

Breaches of the law inside of embassies aren't prosecuted very often, because they're staffed by career diplomats who are expected to be well-behaved, and because everyone who goes inside knows the score. 

For the record, British diplomats in muslim countries will be allowed to drink inside the British embassy (and probably their private residences, too). It may be illegal to drink alcohol in this muslim country, but British diplomats come under British law inside the embassy.

&gt; Where does that law lie with actually dragging Assange out of there?

This would be a violation of the embassy's sovereignty. 

&gt; personally I think if Embassies are used just purely to harbour wanted men who are not citizens of the country that that embassys sole purpose is to serve,

Well, I'm inclined to agree with you, but the ability of *some rare* criminals to take refuge there is a loophole that's kinda inherent to the system.

Assange is only allowed to stay there because the Ecuadorians allow him and he claims to be a political refugee - because he claims he's being unjustly accused because the Americans want to punish him for wikileaks.  

If you or I stole a car or beat our wives, no embassy would harbour us. This is something that's only occurring because Assange claims to be a ""political refugee"" and because Ecuador are backing him.

true,shitakefunshrooms,null,null,"this isn't a solution for 95% of people, but if you're young still i give you this advice

1) save up your job money and start some kind of a side business. online whatever, spend a full sunday every week on it, more if you get the chance.

2) built up an emergency fund and split half of the rest back into the business with the final bit squirreled away for travel

3) use the money you get from this stuff, and saved to buy somewhere warm, sunny, light breeze that is much cheaper to live in than good old blighty. buy land [its much cheaper than here]. make your job part time or find one that lets you choose hours and placements.

4)do the thing the tory bastards do and spend 6 months here and 6 months there. you get your benefit of nhs just in case, and you live your winter in a nice little paradise. leverage those pounds

seriously, i know so many people that did just the above in places like south of france or further afield and they are happy healthy people. they couldnt give a toss about who's in charge anymore.
