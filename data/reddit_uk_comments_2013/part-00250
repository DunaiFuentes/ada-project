In the same genre are the Seven Stars on St Stephen's street and the Apple and the Hatchet. 

Nearer Clifton are 

The Shakespeare and the Ostrich and the Golden Guinea.

I've been wondering ever since the trailer came out if maybe all the incarnations would be involved, and similarly aged due to being inside the time-lock (with some other bit of convenient explanation, of course), and now that I think of it, maybe this could be the real reason that the War Doctor visibly ages so much after ""The Night of the Doctor""?  Also, for that matter, maybe it's just my opinion, but I even thought Ten and Eleven are looking a little rough in the trailer, so maybe it affects them too--maybe aging is proportional to how far back in the Doctor's personal past the incarnation is.

Sakho? I think I saw somewhere that he could be placed on the left side of the defense in a pinch.

I also recall a period of time where Martin Kelly pushed Glen Johnson to the left side and Johnson performed admirably.

I could even see a back four of Johnson - Agger - Skrtel - Toure. That's a lot of skill, talent, and experience right there.

*A special one-off drama that travels back to 1963 to see how Doctor Who was first brought to the screen. Actor William Hartnell felt trapped by a succession of hard-man roles. Wannabe producer Verity Lambert was frustrated by the TV industry's glass ceiling. Both of them were to find unlikely hope and unexpected challenges in the form of a Saturday tea-time drama. Allied with a team of unusual but brilliant people, they went on to create the longest running science fiction series ever made.*

*Followed by William Hartnell: The Original, a five-minute documentary looking at how William Hartnell shaped the Doctor and his legacy. Featuring rare archive footage and new interviews with many who worked with him, including Carole Ann Ford, Peter Purves and Waris Hussein as well as Matt Smith, Peter Davison and Hartnell's granddaughter, Jessica Carney.*",0,1385098695,null,0,1385099554,0,cdka6vz,t3_1r76n6,t1_cdka6vz,t3_1r76n6,null,1428556955,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt; He said: ""Everywhere else in the world, you can shoe your own horse's feet, but in the UK you have to use a farrier who will only use a traditional horseshoe at the minute. 


Utter bollocks, the reason only a farrier is allowed to shoe a horse in this country is because of the level of skill required to do it properly.
Add to that most good farriers will use the correct shoe or no shoe for the horse. If the horse needs a plastic shoe, ceramic shoe or rubber shoe to fix any problem the farrier will recommend and fit it.

Usage of these new terms has been limited; many sources count any syllable exchange as a spoonerism, regardless of location.

I agree with your comment regarding Eto and Torres, I just want to see more of Ba before he leaves us, because he does have the best shot of all 3 strikers when he plays well, and he can score brilliantly (his debut for example, unlucky not to get his hattrick).

The two teams would look something like this.

Team 1

Team 2

The closest the show has come since the reboot to touching on this issue would be in the end of season 4, where the Donna says that the timelord dna mixed with a spark of human creativity allows her to do things the doctor could never imagine. This does suggest that the doctor has no human dna of his own, though it is hardly compelling evidence.

Though the doctor seems as full a timelord as any other we have seen on screen, surely having only half timelord dna would lead to some differences in his abilities, though that is just speculation.

As for Doctor Donna and what The Doctor said about her, Steven Moffat has said a few times that Davies sometimes ignored previous stories if it took away from the story he's telling. ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" isn't held highly with Whovians and Wholigans, so it wouldn't surprise me if Davies ""forgot"" a few human things about it while writing about the meta-crisis. In fact, I don't think Eight was acknowledged by Davies at all in interviews. Moffat has a few times, then there's ""Night of the Doctor"".

I don't think there have been any Time Lord/Lady crossbreeds in the show, so there's no way to tell what stays and gets left behind with offspring. If there's anything that'd point to The Doctor being human in any sort of way, it'd be his curiosity. Time Lords/Ladies aren't very curious. They're very much the stern will of the universe.

When I used to do a short journey on the train I would always buy my season ticket monthly because in my case 12 monthly tickets cost the same as an annual one and I worked out that if I timed my ticket purchases correctly occasionally buying the odd day return I could delay purchasing my monthly ticket so I wasn't paying for weekends, weeks I wasn't using due to holiday and even bank holidays. Think I ended up buying 10 monthly tickets, 1 weekly and a handful of day returns over the course of the year and saved myself over £100 vs just buying the annual pass.

true,vensolis,cnty-commonwealth,it's too hot where I am,"That's not so much being 'proactive' as 'randomly overreacting'. Bank behaviour is about as logical and predictable as a cat's reaction to extensive petting: somewhere, sometime, you're bound to get a reaction - but it's not always the reaction you'd like, much less the reaction you'd want.

For example, banks are VERY proactive in periodically upping the credit limit extended to holders of credit cards. They will do this without your having submitted any shred of evidence whatsoever to show that your earning capacity has increased (and that you are therefore more likely to be able to satisfy any outstanding). In most cases, they will also not ask you if you'd like an extension to your credit; and as for revising your credit limit downwards - you actually have to write in to ask for this. 

What this results in is that you will get a not insignificant proportion of the population with credit limits up to an excess of three times their actual monthly income. It's not rocket science to see how this very easily tempts people into spending far more than they can actually *afford* to. This is just one example of how banks tend to be proactive when something can bring them the dollars, but completely oblivious to the real financial risk potentials they create for their customers.

While it's a good thing that your bank is taking the initiative to check with you before approving a transaction, you should be informed that this is done less to protect YOUR money than it is to protect the BANK'S. 

If a fraudulent transaction is allowed and subsequently it is found not to have been the customer's fault, the Bank not only has to absorb the actual monetary loss occasioned from the fraudulent spend: it also has to forfeit any interest it might have otherwise earned from the balance otherwise outstanding to the credit card (or other loan account) affected. This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are also lawyers to be paid, and if litigation (for whatever reason) ensues, there are going to be additional costs to be borne as well. Not to mention the adverse publicity and real chance of the customer choosing to make an issue of it and &lt;*gasp*&gt; sue the bank.

So yes, while banks can be pretty trollish when it comes to blocking transactions every once in a while, that doesn't make them so much proactive in protecting YOUR interests as it does them protecting their bottomlines. Also, banks are not always very consistent or thoughtful on how they monitor transactions. For example, they may block a £10 transaction in, say... China because China is a card cloning/ card fraud hotspot, but they will be perfectly happy to let a £1,000 transaction in IKEA Leeds through - even though your address held on file with them plainly states you live in Wembley, hold a mortgage with them on a property situated there, and all your statements for the past 10 years have been sent there.

The second reason is, perhaps the more important one, as a currency you can convert money into it but in general terms you are going to struggle to get your money back out of it unless you can con some other sucker in to buying your 'stock'. 

Thirdly as a currency it is unregulated, unbacked and thus as worthless as Deutschmark would be these days for anything useful.  You can't pay your bills with it and Tesco won't accept it for your shopping.  Unless reason two is in effect and you've found another sucker but then you'd be using pounds and pence.

true,dwair,null,Old man drink,"&gt;  it's hard to argue for TV streaming sites convincingly without sounding like somebody who just feels entitled to consume the content free of charge.

You are right and if you use this argument, I don't think anyone would have a leg to stand on as UK copyright law is the law and to some extent viewing or listening to copyright material is immoral. However, I believe that the decision to break the law belongs to the individual and not the state.  

What I find deeply disturbing is the state wishes to take control of what we can access on the internet.  Once the mechanisms for this are legally and physically in place, its very difficult to remove them.  There is no control as to what can be censored and what can't. Once the mechanisms for this are legally and physically in place there is no control over what the government can censor. Mucky pictures and copyrighted material (this will include journalism and many scientific papers as well) today and its a very quick and easy step to include any sort of dissent,  civil liberty's and any news you want (for instance which corporations bankroll the government of the day).  Built in censorship, by it very nature is very, very hard to control.

In my head its not a great leap of imagination to see governmental censorship of the internet as parable to the German book burning in 1933 and goes without saying that whole period of history didn't work out too well.  

Even going back over a couple of years, the Arab spring wouldn't have gained momentum as quickly as it did if the Tunisian and Egyptian governments employed full time competent ISP level censorship. Even in Briton more recently I guess we would have no knowledge of the GCHQ / NSA scandal as the government would have the ability to enforce a ""D"" notice at their whim, irrespective of whether it was in the public's interest to for a paper to publish or not.  I'm not saying that the UK will go down this route, but I think removing the route to the precipice from the map will safe guard our freedom from a government that can do what ever they like.

The solution - If you are going to try and enforce this situation, put the same effort into punishing those who download and hold material outside copyright as they are going to censor the entire country's access to information. 

Long and the short of it is I have lived in country's where censorship and surveillance are normal, where vans turn up in the night to take people away - and they are not nice country's to live in.  It works for a bit  and then it goes pair shaped and the next thing you know your suddenly stuck in the middle of a 14 sided civil war where kids with AK47's throw body parts at passing cars for a laugh.

true,txteva,null,null,"&gt;This girl is doing nothing of her day, staying home, never getting out and live only on benefits (government pays for her rent). 

She sounds depressed – depression (or other similar issues) are disabilities that would entitle her to benefits. 

Whether you like it or not if she has a disability then she is entitled to the support and since you are not a Doctor then you can’t say otherwise.  

I have friend with disabilities who sit around “eating pizzas at home all day along” – that’s not stealing benefits and it doesn't make them a bitch. Attacking random people kinda does make them a bitch.

The issue here really has nothing to do with benefits so I don’t see why you want to put that in – it’s irrelevant - I hope you are not exaggerating because you disagree with the fact she is on benefits. 

However if anyone – benefits or not – attacks someone it should be reported to the police. End of story and if you didn’t encourage your friend to do then that’s kinda bad.     

 Your friend needs to contact their landlord and inform them that there is a tenant who has attacked her and the landlord should throw the tenant out. Be aware your actions might well make her homeless.

If the landlord does not throw her out then your friend needs to move out now.

I assume my bank can differentiate between contactless and traditional uses, so the push notification could only be sent if it was a contactless use. I don't think this would be a great core security feature, but it'd put people's minds at rest a little.

Like helmet compulsion that wont happen - Ill get to that in a minute when I make comments further on.

&gt;and little budget to constantly chase cyclists around their districts - there's little repercussion for not following the law. I can see why the casual cyclist sees no (legal) threat from not bothering.

Its tricky - In an ideal world I would fine everyone who takes the piss, cyclists too. The issue is money and importance. Police have to prioritize according to danger, and a cyclists with no lights is a fraction as dangerous as a speeding car, or a car driving phone user.

&gt;we come back to high-vis clothing and lights as a way to increase safety. (Though it's still the motorists responsibility to stop if they can't see the road at all).

Hiviz in this case is sorta irrelevant - while I wear it myself (reflective not fluorescent), it still relies of drivers looking correctly. Whats interesting is those cyclists who wear all the gear are often the ones who are naturally more careful. But its tricky...I sympathies with both sides.

As for pedestrians - I don't want to wear Highviz to leave the house.

&gt; Have cycling safety campaigners been lying to me all my life? Everyone says a helmet is essential.

Yes and No....

Cycling helmets offer basic protection and are designed to soften blows/protect your head at no more than 12mph. This is great and useful if you fall of your bike, and I would say in that respect for me they are essential (I cycle around 5k miles a year, not fallen off yet but you never know). The bigger picture is more complex. Take the deaths in London, I doubt any helmet would offer much protection to being hit or crushed by a large vehicle. Maybe body armor would make more sense in these cases :P But the cyclists who die by falling off there bikes are tiny compared to those hit at speed or are crushed. In fact according to one thing I read the deaths of cyclists due to falling off their bikes is similar proportionally to pedestrians who fall and hit their heads.

The way I look at it is I wear one because it can only help - but it is dangerous to over state its usefulness.

&gt;this however would fall under the heading of 'tough shit'. I would have no sympathy at all for a motorist who was put off by wearing a seat-belt, driving with lights on at night or without insurance - they're all important

There are multiple issues here - On one hand I see your point, on the other (and maybe whats important here) is the government and health experts say otherwise.

The issue with forcing people to do such things is the perception of cycling changes - this has many knock on effects....

People who would once just pop on their bikes to go down the shops or round a friends house have to ""kit up"". It adds to the idea that cycling (as a whole) is a dangerous activity, or that it takes more effort than it used too or is worth.

You might say so what  - But again the knock on effects of this are the important factor. 

Less people cycling  means more cars, more congestion, loss of health benefits. And somewhat annoyingly cyclists loose the ""safety in numbers"" benefit that means the ones who stay on the roads (kitted up) are in greater danger.

Most look to Australia as an example - when they brought in helmet compulsion cycling numbers dropped by around 30%. Deaths stayed the same, and according to some estimates the loss in health benefits resulted in many 100s of indirect deaths each year via diabetes and heart disease.

The problem is further compounded by another 2 points - cyclists (and those who regularly exercise) live for an additional 2 or 3 years. And if we had helmet compulsion the cycle schemes all over the country would die overnight.

It all ultimately counterproductive.

And that is why no government (apart from Japan I think) wish to enforce these things - and for similar reasons its why bike registration wont happen either.


And while you could argue that's unfair - we are all free to cycle.

I want muso's and actors to be able to earn a living doing what they do well so I can carry on enjoying their efforts.  With the current distribution model, downloads do hurt what little earnings the majority get through copyright so morally I don't think its right.

The problem, as you say, is people who use it as a framework to condone something illegal and the idiots who support that cause (and I'm looking at /r/reinstatearticle8 here) and the slow steady erosion of civil liberty's under a political guise of nest lining (lets control the internet) financial intensive(tax income from sales) and protection of morals (stemming the tide of unimaginable Tiger porn) 

Mass censorship can be likened to suggesting cars should be banned as they might be used as a getaway vehicle after a robbery.  This in itself is a really bad argument as its used in the whole pro ""Guns don't kill people"" lobby and we all know that for the most part, having lots of guns about leads to a massive increase in gun related crime. Tighter control on who owns guns though -  that works.  Its easy to buy guns legally in the uk, but meeting the criteria to buy them is quite difficult.  We also have a moral culture that generally agrees that shooting people is a bad thing. Put the two together and the system seems to work on controlling gun crime.

So what can be done for downloads?  Bar improving a catch and prosecute system and putting the emphasis on the music industry to use evolve a decent DRM I don't think there is a solution.  Who distributes media and who receives it really should be the responsibility of the rights holder rather than the state.  The state can support the action but should not implement it. Your never going to stop pirated material but you can make it harder for it to work, riskier to hold and morally seen as a bad thing.  This does not need state control but the active participation of the music industry in protecting their profits. 

What can be done about porn? So we should educate our children first.  If your you have kids and let them onto the web, its your responsibility to educate them about all the dangers there in. I have kids and see this as my and nobody elses responsibility.  The stuff in the open web is easily policed but will require the cooperation of a few different country's.

It's a Web where user agents—browsers—must navigate a nest of enforced duties every time they visit a page. It's a place where the next Tim Berners-Lee or Mozilla, if they were building a new browser from scratch, couldn't just look up the details of all the ""Web"" technologies.

Except on anything the DRM hooks aren't compatible with or anything the sites that use the DRM decide they don't like. You can't make the problem of work everything with everything go away by embedding the restrictions that cause that in to standard. 

Breaking digital locks is illegal in the US and a bit fuzzy here.

Very little.  The platforms are a fixed length  so longer trains would be quite cumbersome to manage and you can only run so many trains on a given length of track. 

It's the sort of thing that could be solved, given enough time and service disruption but it really would be the £100bn solution: lay new track and temporary tunnels sufficient for the trains to run in some capacity and then send lots of tunneling machines (and work crews) around to widen the tunnels and rebuild the stations. 

Given enough time, money and patience from the customer you could have chunks of the Circle line for example running 4 tracks (2 each way) and the stations to accommodate such things, as well as switching gear for 2 in to 1 where needed.

If it's a more expensive electrical item like a laptop it may be worth taking a short video showing that it works and the serial number ect. 

Then don't scrimp on the postage for expensive , pay for the insured tracking option with signature required on delivery. On less expensive items signature on delivery will be good enough, and i think its less than £1 extra. In the few issues with claim backs i've had all i had to do was upload the postage receipt and they can see that the item has been delivered.

It's fairly easy to give shady buyers no recourse to complain if you take a few simple steps.

There might be analogous, but somewhat different requirements for photographic works or books. Noone has formally brought such requirements to our attention, but that might be something to be looked at in the future.

true,kayleighswift,sussex,Sussex,"&gt; The first is that if you were to install the complete wallet log (I admit it's 20Gb or so but that really is nothing these days) you now have links to kiddie porn on your system. That's enough for plod to seize your machine(s) and charge you.

You don't have to run a bitcoin node in order to trade bitcoin. You can use online wallets, paper wallets, and wallets that only download the relevant parts of the blockchain. Additionally, nobody has yet had a problem with illegal material on the blockkchain. I really don't think it's enough to have the police sneaking around.

&gt;The second reason is, perhaps the more important one, as a currency you can convert money into it but in general terms you are going to struggle to get your money back out of it unless you can con some other sucker in to buying your 'stock'.

This is what Exchanges are for. It's pretty easy to buy and sell Bitcoin. You can use an exchange, or you can use sites like localbitcoins or BitBargain that put buyers in touch with sellers. There are always people looking to buy, and people looking to sell, and this is what drives the market.

&gt;Thirdly as a currency it is unregulated, unbacked and thus as worthless as Deutschmark would be these days for anything useful. You can't pay your bills with it and Tesco won't accept it for your shopping. Unless reason two is in effect and you've found another sucker but then you'd be using pounds and pence.

Actually it's valued at £463/BTC at the time of writing. It has value because people give it value. It's a scarece resource, like gold - but unlike gold it is far more divisible, and can be send worldwide in a matter of minutes.

It doesn't need to be 'backed' by anything. Gold isn't backed by anything, its value is determined by the market.

While Bitcoin is not as widely accepted as cash right *now*, the number of places that accept it is growing rapidly. Again, wide acceptance doesn't drive its value. It can still be easily converted to Fiatk and thus used anywhere that Fiat can be used.

&gt;Fourth, I don't want to hire a hitman and I don't wish to be associated with hiring a hitman.

What's that got to do with Bitcoin? People have been using cash to pay for hitmen since hitmen existed. Does that mean you don't associate yourself with cash either?

&gt; And finally anyone who thinks its anonymous is an idiot and probably thinks TOR is as well; pity the NSA compromised one of the main TOR nodes, I'm sure GCHQ and co. have the others well in hand.

Nobody (that I know of) is claiming that Bitcoin is completely anonymous. And it doesn't need to be to accept payment from somebody for a laptop. The entire transaction ledger is public. That doesn't mean that every transaction is stored against your name &amp; address &amp; national insurance number though. People have to link an address to a person for the information to mean anything. Someone who wants to remain anonymous can do so, if they know what they are doing.",0,1385128599,null,0,false,0,cdkftju,t3_1r4oc7,t1_cdkftju,t1_cdkdvjk,null,1428554257,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This means that, essentially, Monsanto could hold the world in a stranglehold. These crops allow a higher population, so in the future we might need them. However, because Monsanto own the rights, they can hike up the price, essentially holding the world up for hostage. 

I have no problem with GMOs, but I do have a problem with giving companies like Monsanto a monopoly on world food supplies. ",0,1385128946,null,0,false,0,cdkfws1,t3_1r7nut,t1_cdkfws1,t1_cdkevry,null,1428554216,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

In his spare time, he does a bit of charity work and has ran the London marathon and other races to raise some money for children's charity in Africa and India.

This is impressive stuff but you're still skeptical. You ask him how he can afford to do this, he says well, I was born into a wealthy family but I wasn't going to sit on my arse all day and do nothing so I got myself a university education and started my own businesses.

But you're so right, you can't blame people for wanting a better life for themselves, their family, their children. A parent wouldn't put their kid in a terrible comprehensive school ""out of principle"". If they can afford it, they'd pay the money to get them into the best school they can find, no matter how elitist it is.

Same goes for jobs. I won't spend my life trying to fight a corrupt system if I can just get up and get out to a better place. It's selfish, sure, but we all have our own priorities, and it would be naive to think that priority number one isn't self and family.

In the UK, this has already happened in Engineering. Every year we have companies and politicians saying, ""There aren't enough STEM graduates, we need more to keep innovating and keeping our country in the top technological advancers in the world. Universities and schools, why aren't you making these STEM graduates??"".

And you know what happens? I see 75% of my graduating Engineering classmates either go abroad or go work in the city. Why? Because companies and politicians in the UK only pay lip service to ""valuing"" STEM graduates. The grad-schemes pay absolutely appallingly compared to city and bank jobs and companies abroad. And Engineers get very little respect in our culture, thanks in part to it not being a protected title (an electrician is *not* an engineer).

So no wonder we don't have enough STEM talent.

I'm having problem with this person because she assaulted a friend of mine and threatened her to death.

And I don't think she has depression. I think she knows how the system works and with a paper saying she is depressive she can fully profit of any help from society without having to do anything else.

She advised my friend to act as depressive like she did to obtain benefits. I think she has no respect for people who are actually sick of depression. I nonetheless think this person is sick in some form. Can you tell me which sane person would actually enjoy doing nothing of his day, staying home all the time, trying to bring conflict with every people around and cheating on purpose on the system in order to avoid having to pay for anything ?

Please don't be self-centered on the word 'depression'. This is a serious disease and some people are responsible of the misunderstanding around it : the classic ""you can just move your ass out if you are depressive, it'll sort it out"". When you are genuinely depressive, it's not that simple.

Assuming you're using Bitcoin-QT and not a brainwallet: a wallet is a collection of keypairs, and a keypair is just data.  Make as many backups as you want --- but be careful to manage them properly.  Firstly, you need to refresh your backups periodically (read about [keypools](https://iwilcox.me.uk/2013/bitcoin-semi-technical) and [how to check your keypool's oldest key](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1etyce/does_bitcoinqt_warn_you_when_new_keys_are_added/) ).  Secondly, never spend from the same wallet from two different computers (the copies would [diverge](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3497/what-happens-when-the-same-wallet-private-key-is-used-on-several-machines)).  Thirdly, if you encrypt the wallet, heed the warning that comes up.

Be [**very** careful](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet#Redeeming_Keys_and_Withdrawing_Funds) if you use paper wallets. 


&gt; when's the best time to purchase the coins?

When they're cheap!  In terms of time of day, you'll find there's more competition between sellers during more sociable hours.  Try not to buy in the middle of the night.


&gt; what provisions are made on what sites to protect me in case they turn out to be scammers?

BitBargain.co.uk and LocalBitcoins are escrow-based, meaning you only have to trust the admin and their fair resolution of any dispute (which are rare at BitBargain; don't know about LocalBitcoins).


&gt; how quickly can one sell it off?

I'd advise having a fixed selling price and sticking to it, else you might be tempted to panic-sell and you'll be taken advantage of.  That said, registering with an exchange reduces sell latency to a minimum.  Avoid *storing* coins anywhere but your wallet though, since local wallets are typically more secure if you have [good security practices](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/securing_your_wallet‎).


&gt; I also just saw the price at localbitcoins drop to £185.7 on bitcoinity, but on accessing their site I don't see anything at that price

To address one of the points - if she's physically violent, there's no reasonable excuse for such behaviour; my suggestion would be to report the matter to the police service, but aggregate as much evidence as possible in the meantime to back up your claims. Is your flatmate constantly aggressive?

In terms of your landlord, it's important to note that you too have rights. He can't simply evict you because he's getting some action from the girl; it may cause tension, but you absolutely don't have to move unless he has a legitimate reason to do so, or unless you wish to.

To that end, I would suggest that it might be worth your while saving as much money as you can, and moving *with* your friend; the atmosphere obviously isn't beneficial to your own mental well being in the long term; I know it's unfortunate, but I would suggest that from a realist point of view, that if the landlord is involved with your other flatmate that you won't be getting rid of her any time soon.

EDIT - Looks like this claim is probably not true - however they [it is accepted they use intimidation tactics against farmers, over reach their legal claims, and make accusations against farmers not backed up by evidence.] (http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/10/18/163034053/top-five-myths-of-genetically-modified-seeds-busted)


The following claims are very true :


Monsanto lobby hard to ensure GM food isn't labelled as such. They've failed (so far) in EU, but have had big wins in the US. Their argument is, why should it be labelled as GM - it's safe, so the public don't need to know.


You may think that this is a legitimate point of view.  But they also want to ban organic companies from saying their food is ""GM free"".   They don't want the provenance of food to be something the public is aware of.   The refusal to allow full information about the product to be known flies in the face of any sensible capitalistic model, consumers not being allowed to know how their food was produced is a bad road to go down.


The evidence for this comes from their legal fight over rBGH growth hormone, which they own the patent on, and is used by many large diary farms.  They are suing, and lobbying for changes in the law, to prevent organic and smaller farms from labelling their milk [""contains no rBGH hormone"" ](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/05/monsanto200805) 


Monsanto have an almost complete monopoly on some food supplies - 90% of the soybean market for example. Regardless of whether monopolies are good or bad thing in business, in a food supply it can be fatal.

We are now seeing ""[round up ready superweeds](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/20/us-monsanto-superweeds-idUSTRE78J3TN20110920)"", essentially over reliance on Monsanto round up ready GM crops, has meant that weeds have evolved to also be roundup resistant as well. So now, we have farms fighting weeds they can't kill with herbicides.  

Currently there is no evidence GM produces food in more abundance than conventional farming, besides which, we don't have a food shortage problem - we have a food distribution problem, the west is fat, and the rest of the world is hungry.  So the speed and pressure to move to GM isn't based on real world needs, but we're doing it to help Monsanto shareholders. 

That said, non Monsanto use of GM  in itself isn't bad - the [golden rice](http://www.goldenrice.org/) project in particular is interesting, and most importantly, seed is freely reusable in that project.",0,1385131160,null,0,1385138195,0,cdkgjza,t3_1r7nut,t1_cdkgjza,t1_cdkevry,null,1428553915,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

true,LS69,eng-yorkshire,We are Leeds,"&gt; Everyone says a helmet is essential.

No they don't. The evidence just isn't there.

Look at Austrialia and mandatory helmet laws.

http://cyclehelmets.org/1241.html

""Comparisons of pre- and post-law injury data (Figs 1-5) show that there is little benefit to either cyclists or the community from passing laws forcing cyclists to wear helmets. Rather than encouraging cyclists to wear helmets, the laws appear to have discouraged cycling, resulting in reduced health and fitness, but very little change in %HI. If the money spent on helmets had been used for other measures e.g. improving accident blackspots for cyclists, the benefits would have much been greater.

**More importantly, risks per cyclist seem to have increased, compared to what would have been expected without the law, implying that helmet laws are counter-productive. Possible explanations include risk compensation, reduced ‘Safety in Numbers’ and that brain damage is predominantly due to rotational injury.**



""The use of helmets increases the size and mass of the head. This may result in an  increase in brain injury by a number of mechanisms.  Blows that would have been glancing become more solid and thus  transmit increased rotational force to the brain. These forces result in shearing stresses on neurones which may result in  concussion and other forms of brain injury."" (NHMRC, 1994)



**""The earliest murmurings that I heard against  helmets were from a neurosurgeon who I worked for in 1994. He claimed that cycle helmets were turning what would  have been focal head injuries, perhaps with an associated skull fracture, into much more debilitating global head  injuries. We had a couple of examples on the ward at the time, and it was a bit worrying. However, I wasn’t too  convinced as I figured that the injuries that would previously have been focal head injuries may well have been resulting  in death, so the neurosurgeon was never actually seeing them. Instead, they were making their way straight to the  pathologist.""**(Bloomfield, 2000)",0,1385132180,null,0,1385132693,0,cdkgvq5,t3_1r7gzn,t1_cdkgvq5,t1_cdkedaa,null,1428553762,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,Leral,null,null,"Some quotes from [Prof. John Curtice's evidence to the Equal Opportunities Committee](http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/S4_EqualOpportunitiesCommittee/Curtice_John.pdf):

&gt; * SSA has asked its respondents on three occasions whether they agree or disagree that ‘gay or lesbian couples should have the right to marry one another if they want to’. On the first occasion in 2002, 41% agreed and while 29% disagreed. Thereafter much as one would expect given the trend in attitudes towards same sex relations in general, support for the proposition increased such that by the most recent reading in 2010, as many as 61% agreed and only 19% disagreed.

&gt; * A similar pattern of response to SSA’s most recent reading was obtained in an Ipsos MORI poll that was conducted in Scotland in June 2012 and which asked a not dissimilarly worded item on behalf of the Equality Network. This found that 64% agreed that ‘same sex couples should have the right to get married’, while 26% disagreed. 

&gt; * ...three polls conducted by Angus Reid across Britain as a whole. It invited respondents to choose between three options: Same sex couples should be allowed to legally marry, Same sex couples should be allowed to form civil partnerships, but not legally marry, and Same sex couples should not have any kind of legal recognition. Although on the three occasions on which this question was posed between January 2012 and January 2013, the proportion saying that same sex couples should be allowed to marry was the single most popular response, the proportion in favour was somewhat less than half. However, when on one of these surveys (conducted in January 2013) respondents were then also asked which option they would choose if the only options on offer were to allow same sex couples to legally marry or not, 52% said
that they would support same sex marriage, while 38% said they would not. Thus it would appear that not all those for whom same sex marriage is not their first preference are necessarily strongly opposed
to its introduction.

&gt; * From the available evidence it would appear that following a dramatic change in attitudes towards same sex relations during the course of the last 25 years, a change that has perhaps left some older people and those with strong religious convictions living in an unfamiliar world, that there is now probably a majority, albeit not necessarily an overwhelming one, in favour of same sex marriage, at least when the proposal is posed as a dichotomous choice.",0,1385132784,null,0,false,0,cdkh2r8,t3_1r3h8t,t1_cdkh2r8,t1_cdkczbs,null,1428553671,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,unfortunatefew,null,null,"I finally watched on hulu. I was really disappointed in this episode.  It was pretty weak in my opinion, especially in contrast to episode 4.  The premise was unimaginative and predictable.  I feel like I've seen the same plot on any number of bad '90s speculative tv shows. I think showing the ""code world"" beyond the front door of the virtual flat was a mistake.  It looked cheesy.  I would rather have seen Jess use her x-ray vision than see them blow the special effects budget that way.

Rant ahead.

First: What the fuck, Finn?  Are we really supposed to believe that he falls for the first girl who pays attention to him, even after she abducts him and keeps him prisoner? And what about his feelings for Jess? He thinks she's the perfect girl one minute, and the next he's not conflicted about hooking up with Leah at all, ignoring the fact that she used someone else's body to deceive him, took over his own body to kidnap him, trapped him in a virtual world and won't let him leave?  It's ok because she brought him a virtual pizza?  Is Finn actually mentally ill?  I would think at the very least he would have big trust issues with women due to how Sadie manipulated him, not to mention it seems that every time he comes in contact with a new girl they a. rape him (stepmother), b. blank him (funeral girl), or c. try to make him an agent of Satan (scout girl).  I'm sure it was a big relief for him to meet someone who he thought was normal and he actually would have been really upset by how things turned out.  I don't know about you, but if someone kidnapped me and kept me prisoner I would not want to have sex with them, no matter how sad and agoraphobic they were. Seriously, WTF.  Have some fucking boundaries already Finn, you stupid jerk.  Plus I am already wondering if we are ever going to see Leah again or if she's going to be like Finn's sister and disappear, never to be spoken of again. 

Second: Are we really supposed to believe that Jess, with all of her trust issues, forgives Rudy for the shitting video fiasco? Really? Just because he said he did it for love?  I really like the idea of them getting together, but I think it's more realistic and even more compelling that she would just NOT put up with his shit and in response he has to try to be a better person to win her over.  I get that she likes him too, but she is supposedly recovering from being betrayed by her first love and then by Alex.  Wouldn't Rudy have to work a little at getting her to trust him?  And then he does this horrible thing and she's ok with it as soon as he says she's ""shit beautiful""? I don't believe it.  That's just not the Jess we've seen for the last two seasons.

Third: Speaking of Alex, why didn't Rudy or Jess seem concerned about him while they are trying to figure out how to break news of their budding romance to Finn?  I mean, Jess was actually involved with Alex not too long ago.  How is it that he doesn't matter in this equation?  If he's cool with it, then show that.  Not addressing it at all seems lazy.

Also, someone in this thread already mentioned the thing about Alex indicating that he was ready and willing to rape Leah in order to take her power.  I have been uncomfortable with how rape has been portrayed in this show before - the aforementioned stepmother surprise! oral sex, Alisha using her power on Curtis and no one seeming to care, Alex saving the day by ""shagging the devil out of"" Finn - but this was over the top creepy.  What would have happened if Finn hadn't declared that it wasn't necessary? Would he have attacked her? Would anyone have stopped him?  Is Alex actually going to become a rapist, tracking down villains and raping them to remove their powers?  It's just so weird that no one ever seems bothered by any of it.

Evolution of weeds to herbicides is a serious problem. Saying, it's OK we'll just keep inventing more herbicides isn't a sensible answer.

 The over reliance and inappropriate over use of roundup ready is the plant equivalent of the antibiotic problem.

Many of them?  Care to name them?  Because it looks like you're just spamming generic responses on this thread - in your 5 myths link for example, only 1 applies to my post.

The ""myth"" Monsanto sues farmers.  Except they do,

It has an enormous amount of clinical foundation, proven efficacy, and supporting evidence, and receives significant funding from the NHS. With that comes a significant amount of credibility and trust, which is, in many cases, deserved.

It is heavily regulated in many countries, and is a protected title in much of Europe. We are highly unusual in developed nations in allowing a free for all in this form of treatment.

I would add we are also not simply talking about psychotherapy. These practices encompass clinical psychology practicioners and various behavioural therapies, many of which again possess considerable clinical substantiation, and have far more potent and clinically consistent outcomes than medication. 

It certainly is the government's job to regulate practices being sold as therapeutic for which considerable research indicates a high potential for harm when done carelessly.

Ministers for Health rarely have understanding of cardiac surgery. That has not, heretofore, prevented them from regulating it.

Alternative medicine is medicine not based on scientific evidence or method. This clearly excludes psychotherapy and other behavioural therapies, which have a significant clinical and emprical foundation.

Weed control is a rather studied science.   I spent a few summers back in the day at college killing and not killing weeds.    Rotation management prevents natural selection.    Using the same HT trait year after years leads to selective pressure.    Nobody thought it was an issue when atrazine had created weeds immune to it in the 1970's.    Less powerful and safer herbicides replaced it, effectively destroying the creation of atrazine resistant plants.

A song isn't going to incite people to draw kids pictures or visit Colorado or turn gay. They're gonna do it anyway.

How many people listen to the lyrics of Blurred Lines? It's a catchy pop tune.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I also think folk should be able to take any treatment they choose to...

I have several issues with this view:

* A lot of people who go into gay cure therapy don't choose, they get pressured into it by their parents after their parents find out they are gay or simply think they might be gay. They often go under this ""therapy because their parents want them to, not the patent.

* It simply doesn't work, even [""Ex gay"" organisations admit this](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2012/08/04/gay-cure-renounced-worlds-largest-ex-gay-group). I'd call it snake oil, but...

* It actually does more harm than good. The way ex gay therapy operates is that is makes the person in therapy more and more fearful of their sexuality. Then it instills the idea that the only way to get rid of those feelings is to start a relationship with someone of the opposite sex and live as straight a life as you can. They're still gay, they've just been brainwashed into thinking that having a wife and kids will make them straight. This can cause massive stresses on the person.

* It's totally ineffective: think of all the ""Straight"" anti-gay campaigners caught with a cock in their mouth. The anti gay church leaders, politicians and campaigners. Even those who have been anti-gay therapy often, always ""regress"".

In short. Ex gay therapy is a scam, used to abuse gay people, used by parents in hope their kids will turn out straight and shit out more babies for the church or Mosque. It's like Homeopathy, only homeopathy doesn't break up families that should never have been in the first place.",0,1385136430,null,0,false,0,cdkie0m,t3_1r7wv4,t1_cdkie0m,t1_cdkh4qv,null,1428553011,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

Why? I don't think you have made the case that it is at all.

We are talking about medical treatments, with scientifically established clinical efficacy. There are potent physiological and neurological responses to both (depending on the drug obviously).

This is not people jumping around in a circle. This is extremely potent medical practice, derived from training, placing professionals in a position of powerful over the vulnerable, claiming scientific credibility and selling itself using that authority. 

The majority of countries which have non-drug mental health treatment widely available have recognised that it absolutely requires regulation.

They're kind of right. The maintenance loan is for rent, but how much maintenance you get depends on your family income. Why won't they help? Because they can't afford to? If your parents are on a very low income, you should get the full-whack maintenance, which after paying rent (depending the accommodation cost) some people usually have a lot of money leftover. On top of that there are overdrafts on Student accounts, that although I don't recommend you go crazy over (like I did, oops), should tie you over for the first few months. Of course, that can only take you so far.  

As for jobs, try any form of bar work in the Uni town, or even try applying for jobs at the Students' Union.  

**Edit**  

For University accommodation, you could look into house sharing. Actual Uni halls owned by the Uni or companies such as Unite are a fucking *rip-off*. Absolute rip-off. I've seen shitty 1-bed and en suite rooms by Unite asking for £110 a week. You can share a student house (like a terraced house in Huddersfield owned by a private landlord) for half that.

No one is objecting to that.

They are objecting to it being sold as medical treatment. 

OR that people in this country have absolutely no way of identifying who is a qualified credible mental health therapist, because there is no protected term.

With statutory regulation, people would instantly be able to see who is a qualified professional, subjected to professional standards, and who is not. 

Dietetics is a regulated medical profession in this country. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING stopping people from claiming they are a nutritionist, and offering (frequently bad) nutrition advice. But they cannot claim to be a dietician, and that is who can be sought for definitively safe, credible advice.

That is what is being sought after when people talk about regulation. It is only there to apply to registered medical professionals claiming a professional title. 

Anyone who wants to set themself up and offer advice is ALWAYS free too, they just can't claim the professional title or registration.

This is about empowering the consumer with information about what is potentially an incredibly risky form of treatment. Its not about removing choice.

She is sort of right. They get about 45-50k income, and so much of it goes on beer. They (mother and step-father) will drink 6-12 cans of beer each about 5 nights a week, sometimes more, and I'm not even joking.


This leaves them with not a lot of disposable income and they would in no way be willing to drop their drinking habits as they're both in denial about it.

I guessed the fees (you mentioned 2 different universities), but you'll get the amount anyway.

£5,343 Maintenance Loan (for living costs) -- This covers rent and living costs ~~and should be enough, as long as you aren't a party animal~~. It is possible to apply for extra funding mid-term, this is typically known as a 'hardship' fund/grant. You would need to explain that your family isn't helping and give accounts of your outgoings.

Originally, I was expecting rent in Sheffield to be nearer to ~£3500, yet all the accommodation on the universities site indicates it will be between £4000 and 5000 for 42 weeks. You can rent a spacious (500sqft) city centre apartment in Leeds for a similar rate (£500pcm) whilst those university blocks are shared bathrooms and kitchens. 

When renting in your second year watch out, as students get royally fucked by landlords. For example, I know people renting a ""3"" bedroom house for £975 (a 2 bed with the living room converted), when similar properties on the same street rented for £500.

You may have to engage in some tight budgeting, use your overdraft, and hope you can find some work whilst at university. I'd also be asking for cash for any birthdays/Christmas presents if you can't find work. Your parents might not give you any extra money, but lots of parents will buy a round of shopping at the start of each term -- so use that to stack up on pot noodles and the like.

1. That the cyclist has a camera.    
2. That an interesting ""incident"" has to occur.    

So any video that is popular enough to get your attention likely already self-selected itself.

Here is an outline of it so far:
&gt; History - see it being made now with the rise of a new digital currency.
&gt; ==================================================================
&gt; We have never seen virtual money/currency being used in any real sense before, but now with the advent of new ATMs being installed in many parts of the World the confidence in this very new currency, bitcoins, is rising rapidly:
&gt; http://nautil.us/blog/bit-by-bitcoin-virtual-currency-looks-a-little-more-real
&gt; which is increasing its market price at a staggering rate:
&gt; http://blockchain.info/charts/market-price
&gt;
&gt; I first saw this in 2009 when each bitcoin cost just a few cents, now its hundreds of dollars each!  This is the first time a digital currency (cryptocurrency) has reached such a high standing and having ATMs for their use too.  On 19th November 2013 bitcoin was accepted by the US Senate committee as a legitimate financial service and the price rocketed again above $900:
&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24986264
&gt; The same day saw the volume of transactions over take Western Union:

&gt;

in practical terms, however, it will probably only go to paying rent. my (vague) knowledge of student rents suggests that the loan amounts in the link above won't do much more than cover rent, if that.

the best way to supplement this (assuming you're family aren't about to surprise you) is get a job, and you have that covered, or at least are trying.  the other suggestions i have are that it is possible to get grants/bursaries etc despite being notionally rich.  some funds want to support poor students and some want to support bright or otherwise exceptional students.  also, look into unusual little money earning techniques like regularly partaking in online surveys etc.  i'm sorry that i can't find/post links for this sort of thing (i'm about to go out!) but i have heard plenty of stories about them. maybe someone else can link you up?

 Sometimes videos are posted just to show potential dangerous situations, and to spread awareness so that accidents in the future can be avoided. Sometimes cyclists post videos just to show off a scenic route they take that they enjoy and want to share. I doubt you see those videos very often though.

The videos involving cyclists that go viral are the ones with genuine conflict, and the reason you think that cyclists are playing the victim game in those videos is because in road accidents involving cyclists, they overwhelmingly ARE the victims.

Being the far more vulnerable road users it's not at all unusual that cyclists take precautions to enable them to document the incident in the undesirable event that they are involved in an accident. To then turn around and claim that they desire such things to happen is arrogant, and completely ignores the actual reasons that cycling is so dangerous in the first place.

............................................................

In my case a random woman attacked me over my hedge as she considered i had cut 'too severely' and ' I was killing the world' . I fought her off by pushing her to the ground and walked back to my house and called the police

When the police arrived i told my side of the story very matter of factly, calmly and with loads of politeness.

They then arrested me. When I protested asking why she wasn't being arrested i was told 'Because she phoned us first' (apparently I wasn't fast enough)

I was held for 23 hours and charged with assault ( but not her)

From arriving, they took what she said as gospel, fuck what i said.

It wasn't until my trial a year later that i found out that the police so ignored what i has to say that they hadn't even taken notes of what i said at the scene.

Calling them as witness as what they did on scene was a complete waste of time as all they could say prior to me arriving at the police station was 'I cant remember' and the only evidence they could provide was the custody record ( for which i subsequently complained was not PACE compliant, and got a partial apology) and formal inverview.

Found not guilty due to self defense ( once my lawyer pointed out all the contradictions between her statement and what she said on the stand, And that i was the only one who sustained an injury)

Was she subsequently investigated for starting it?..Like hell she was",0,1385142093,null,0,false,0,cdkkofd,t3_1r7ht4,t1_cdkkofd,t1_cdkk0wc,null,1428551943,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

1. I am **not** defending the driver, they're still absolutely at fault.   
2. I am making the assumption that it wasn't on purpose (which I feel is a reasonable assumption to make).    

So that being said... The silver van-thing in the right turning lane (their right) is a little tall, maybe just tall enough to obscure the cyclist as they approached? Particularly a cyclist several feet in front (making them appear smaller).   

Maybe both the cyclist AND car approached at the same-ish speed, keeping the cyclist perfectly within the car driver's blind spot, so from their perspective the cyclist appeared to just appear out of nowhere as they pulled up to the line.   

So the driver really had no way of seeing the cyclist until too late.    

That still makes this accident the driver's fault 100%. You stop at the white lines, even if you don't see a cyclist, you stop and you look. You don't just roll on through. That's what the driver was doing, rolling through because he looked to his right and couldn't see any cars, and didn't even consider a potential blind spot.   

I'm glad nobody was hurt. I just like to consider why accidents like this can happen. It would be easy to just chalk it up to the driver being in a rush and rolling the white line (and not really unfair either) but I think the blindspot has to be considered as a minor contributor too.

When I was younger I always skipped over the Doctor. I knew it was on PBS and I knew the theme song, but I never got into it. I guess I never caught an episode in full, or just at the time didn't really like British things and just ignored it.

For so long it was just a thing that existed to me, I had a few friends who watched it, and at least one who suggested I watch it, but I pushed it off and continued watching whatever else I was into at the time. 

One day around a year ago or so I was pretty bored at home and I had been thinking about watching another TV show just to see what all the fuss was about, I picked Doctor Who over Sherlock and probably various others, I started with Rose.

I think that first day I watched at least half of the first season. I finished it quickly and suddenly there was a new Doctor, I didn't really like him at first (as compared to Christopher Eccleston who I consider my Doctor (You never forget your first Doctor)) but he grew on me, and I enjoyed David Tennant eventually (I think it was School Reunion and knowing that Sarah Jane was a classic HUGE companion) that sealed 10 for me. I made my way quickly through the rest of 10's reign. Then he didn't want to go, and I was sad. 

Season 5+ has its up and downs (but what show honestly doesnt?) and Matt Smith was harder to accept as the Doctor than David Tennant had been, then I watched Vincent and the Doctor and that sealed Matt Smith as the Doctor for me. 

I have since watched the entire new series at least 3 times this year, I've watched the movie twice, I've watched and still watch the classic episodes (they're harder to digest just because I didn't live during those times) but still great. 

I now have my own sonic screwdriver, I have 11 ""lego"" Doctors, I have three tshirts and several posters. 

This image: http://i2.wp.com/www.geeksaresexy.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/drwho.jpg?w=640 is literally what happened to me. 

Watching Doctor Who has made me more humanistic than I was before, its given me a new passion that I was lacking before, its given me the chance to meet new and interesting people and have (mostly) civil discussions with them. While I don't have any hardcore Whovian friends like me, I still try to sneak a little Doctory stuff into day to day conversations. They may not catch it, but I did it and I know what I meant and it was probably something for the betterment of mankind anyway so it applied regardless!

Once I became engrossed in everything Who, I started noticing references in everything else. I started playing Borderlands 2 and there was ClapTrap saying Allons-y!, I was watching an episode of Futurama and there was something about a Space Whale, and I was sitting there thinking ""there better be a Doctor Who reference here"" and at the end out walks a man with big curly hair and long scarf. 

It's a lovely community to be a part of, I can't think of another community following like this one that literally bridges age gaps (maybe the Simpsons?) because its been around and been such a thing that's ingrained into everything for so long.

The problem is that he then started to pull away without having turned to look back. If he had then there's no way he could have missed me - I was only travelling around 7mph as it was uphill - no way I could have gotten from behind the other vehicle to directly in front of him so fast that he wouldn't have seen me if he was facing forwards.

The story was exciting, many of the revelations in it are potentially ground-shaking in terms of canon, the acting was great, and the sound design was phenomenal.  Who composed that fantastic title song at the beginning?  It rivaled almost anything Murray Gold has written for the show.  This audio was absolutely wonderful, and something that should be mandatory for any true Whovian.  
  
In addition to the obvious big reveal, there are several other interesting additions to what we know about Gallifreyan history:   

SPOILERS BELOW  
...  
...  
...  
...    

[1. Rassilon](#s ""was imprisoned 'in the moment between his twelfth and final incarnations.'  Does this mean that Timothy Dalton's form was his final incarnation, or was he given another cycle like the Master was?  If somehow the same thing happened to the Doctor, that might provide an avenue for the creation of the Valeyard."")

[2. Also, Rassilon](#s ""underwent a major personality change when he started using the Coronet of Rassilon, 'as if he was possessed'.  Could there be a greater, darker entity behind Rassilon's madness?  Where did the Coronet come from anyway?"")
  
[3. In addition, Rassilon](#s ""apparently left the scroll for the Doctor himself to find!  This of course implies foreknowledge on Rassilon's part of what the Doctor will mean for Gallifrey's destiny.  Or, he had some greater plan in place that has yet to play out."")
  
[4. The boy](#s ""remains unnamed, yet the name of 'the Doctor' is granted special significance because it came from a scroll written by Rassilon, presumably containing something he learned in the Dark Times.  Thus BOTH of the Doctor's names are significant.  His original name because it will one day seal his Tomb, and 'the Doctor' because it has mysterious origins.  Because he took the name so young, if the boy's family later fell into obscurity, it would explain how nobody knows the Doctor's true name, and why it would be used as a secure password to his Tomb."")  

[5. Lord Archeron](#s ""is clearly meant to fill the role of the Other, the mysterious third Time Lord who along with Rassilon and Omega played a crucial role in the origins of Time Lord society.  Presumably, after this incident, his name was purged from records and forgotten, due to the shame upon his memory thereafter.  It's also neat how the name that was 'given to him' by Rassilon was never taken up by him, and instead the boy takes it on willingly.  This dovetails nicely with old rumors that the Doctor might have been the Other."")

[6. Finally, Lord Archeron](#s ""'regenerates' for the last time, and then is apparently gone.  Has it ever previously been established what happens to Time Lords when they reach their regeneration limit?  It seems clear from this story that the regeneration happens like it normally would, except the body is wholly consumed by it.  No mention is made here of a 'time scar', so that phenomenon remains unique to the Doctor - so far."")

Thoughts?

Quite a few people I've known invested less that £50 on Bitcoin as they were getting used to it. And it's easier for people to feel more comfortable with a newer model of funding by testing it first.

It's like Bitcoin itself, its a bit of a learning/trust curve for people to accept that Bitcoin has value (and that they should get some). Completely stepping away from the banks is another learning/trust curve, which understandably not many are ready for yet (similar to how many are not ready to embrace Bitcoin yet).

A European account is no different from using any other exchange. Transfer fees, exchange rates, and far longer time delays. We would not be trading in GBP then, it would just be Euro, like Bitstamp.

However, we are looking at alternative methods of funding (as you suggest), so that people can use bank deposits. We will make it public when we add any additional funding methods.

High link karma compared to comment karma is EVIDENCE of a spammer.  You link karma is over 150x your comment karma.  What that means is you don't regularly participate in the threads that you post to reddit.  You are using reddit to link to outside content and not participating in the community.

We have tracked anti-GMO activists working directly for organizations using sock puppet accounts to spam reddit.  They have used dozens accounts to posts 10s of thousands of these types of links.

This wouldn't be an issue if they were on the right side of the science or were promoting factual information.  However, what we see is people willing to lie and distort information to promote their political (specifically Luddite anti-science) ideology.

I also Disagree with the 2 formations/lineups you pick though. They're bollocks tactically and defensively.

More than the formation it's about the transitions in the play and the way we commit men forward. We commit 3 men forward at once at least, we don't really allow the Striker to be the focal point so much nor do we really play a false 9. We try and cross with sub par crossing and heading and a lack of overlap and general width. We also end up splitting the midfield with 5 defenders and 5 attackers. That is in no way how any team should really be run. It doesn't work particularly well and balls being forced back need to be played back out wide or deep, as a result we will consistently be pinned quite far back by pressing teams. Basically we're trying to play possession football without any real idea how to do the movement part. The most important vital part. Not only that but I have a suspicion we're drilling out a lot of the creativeness and free moving ability in players. Particularly with someone such as Mata, who should, in theory, be a Zola-esque (hyphen as I'm not talking about the writer haha) mover. 

So yes there's a fuck of a lot going wrong, I'm increasingly worried that we keep splitting the midfield which is quite simply retarded when you only play 2CM's. Certainly playing 3 in midfield (not AM) helps a lot, especially given our midfield.

Although it's quite plain to say that a 3 man centre midfield would help us massively, particularly with ball retention and general responsiveness. We're appalling in the middle.

It's far easier to frustrate a team that passes through you only than one that might cut through you too.

true,roofdrake,null,null,"As an American I enjoyed both character and the actresses that played them. Below is my interpretation of each one:

Martha: She was well educated as a physician (doctor) but showed some insecurities. She was that person who, to me, felt that if they stay with the one that they have a crush on that other person (Doctor) would eventually notice them. But as her time with the Doctor she began to realize her strength and that relationship won't happen. This is relevant when she left (Last Of The Time Lords)and told her story about her friend to the Doctor. To me she was quite and had manners, she would be the woman you take to dinner and a movie.

Donna: She was not as educated but she was self assured of who she was and what she wanted. Donna was there for the adventure and nothing more. She is the cat that stuck her head in the hole without a care. The Doctor and Donna were friends, equals in everything. Donna would be the woman you take to the game and have a beer with, also she would have your back in bar fight.

For me both charters were not my favorite but they held their own. They brought something to Doctor Who and the best thing is that they were not the ""damsels in distress"". And for someone, anyone, to say they HATED one or the other is missing the big picture.  To like or dislike something is not a culture but a personal likes and dislikes and also it seems like that we have to choose a side.

After all it's sometimes good to break things, it can lead to a better replacement.

true,CapnJager,,Rum and coke. No ice.,"Fuck ... I honestly have no idea what to say ... Sooo I'll tell you a bit about my week, as you requested.  
  
Absolute shit start to the week. Apparently at some point I was expected to develop psychic powers and complete work before I'd even been told about it.  
  
On Wednesday night I carried on working at home far too late into the night, nearly threw up everywhere because I was feeling so miserable and finally resigned myself to about 4 hours sleep full of nightmares.  
  
Yesterday went by in a complete daze. I was pretty much left alone to crack on with work and was just happy to get home without curling up under my desk and crying.  
  
Today is where it picked up a bit. (Well ... A lot). My manager asked for a quick word in his office. I naturally thought that I'd fucked up at some point during this shitty week and braced myself for a bollocking.  
  
But no! **I was offered a fucking pay rise!** Same hours but with a bit more responsibility (well within my capabilities) and from the 9th of December my pay goes up.  
  
Day off tomorrow, so I'm going to sleep for as long as possible, then we're off to a surprise party in Whitchurch tomorrow night. It's been a while since we've been out for a good drink. :-D  
  
**TL;DR: Week is shit, ends in pay rise. Party tomorrow.**

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt; Pharmaceutical companies have no incentive to do this though with or without regulation. 

There is absolutely no need to be a trusted brand, or a particularly large company to gain a market position in a globalised economy. Both in terms of the production of pharmaceuticals and the retail of them. Such organisations have every incentive to cut corners because they will never face any consequences from customer deaths without explicit legal prevention. Against such vendors the solution is to prevent their product reaching the market

Moreover under your system this would only become more pronounced. Cheap, untraceable drug imports would be widely available at small retailers, market stalls and individual vendors, who don't feel the weight of exposure to risk that larger companies do, or necessarily become aware of its significance until faced with it. The response to a lawsuit is simply to declare bankruptcy, then open another business doing exactly the same thing. As a correcting guarantee in the market, lawsuits are a very weak pillar.

Try enforcing a high court writ against a dodgy car dealer and you will see what I mean.

We'd be looking at mass selling of generics and fakes, the latter of which would have the authority of the branding, with none of the consequences for the manufacturer.

Consumer decision making is an incredibly powerful market force, but only when it is informed. Deregulation removes information, and with it the ability to make informed consumer choices. Particularly given you are permitting flagrant false advertising under your suggested system.

true,sammyslug,cnty-england,Police Officer AMA!,"Police officer here. 

I was quite surprised at how reasonable the film seemed. She makes a very valid point.

The issue that officers have is that we get lots of bulletins every week of new laws that we have to learn and use in our work, everything from changes to the way we arrest people, changes to powers, new offences, etc in addition we get updates from our forces on how we should deal with certain incidents, use new laws, etc.

The trouble is that this is overwhelming, especially when you get very little time to read these updates at work because the minute you start you are turned out to an emergency call, you spend the shift dealing with jobs and by the time you get back you finish late with paperwork and don't get round to fully reading the updates. Or you are on annual leave for a couple of weeks and come back to a lot of updates, emails, and an increased workload so you miss out some updates.

None of this is really excusable, but it happens. How do officers try and deal with this? They ask their colleagues if there have been any changes they need to know about. The trouble with this is that if misinformation is given by the colleague it spreads like wildfire. Such as this case where the information given was ""It's illegal to photograph a copper"". Especially when the media have misleading headlines or stories [1](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7888301.stm) [2](http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/1644048/jail-photographing-police) which, when read in brief, give a slanted view to people on what powers police have.

Now don't get me wrong; Officers should know the law, and they should know their powers. But officers are human, rely on others and make mistakes. One problem is its very hard for officers to admit they are wrong, there are several reasons behind this.

I strongly believe that ongoing training is terrible within the police. Our new training is delivered by ""e-training"" national issued powerpoints with no trainer and no one to ask questions too, important new law updates are sent out by weekly email or on the intranet (amongst hundreds of other emails which get ignored/deleted as junk each week), with a small note and expecting officers to do more research. As professionals we should research these things but because we are overworked and trying to cope with what we already do it leads to things being missed.

People should stand up for their rights but the other thing to remember is you are seriously unlikely to get an officer to admit they are wrong on the street, and they can use force (legally or illegally) to defend their position. It is better to remain calm, make a note of their details and complain later. It is not giving in, it is realising you are not going to win on the street, but you can sue/complain/raise hell after.

They should do so within a week, but I've been embroiled in an 8 month long dispute with them about fraud before, albeit for £67 instead of the above. I will become violent if they don't give me my money back this time given how much it is (they have different sorts of disputes, won't bore you). 

&gt;I wonder what the people who do this would think if they realised just how much grief they cause?

They don't give a shit, they know the UK banking system has circa £650m per year factored in for fraud, most of which is absorbed by our bank charges. 

&gt;As for the work colleagues, fuck 'em. Eat all the Roses yourself next time :)

I was too queasy. Also, not a massive chocolate lover (although I've had phases but they don't last long). Bought them to visit a friend last weekend, had to cancel due to a (four day) migraine, dropped them, damaged the lid, not good enough to keep for rearranging and I don't want to eat 120 chocolates ffs. Given that work colleagues have also stolen my soup and helped themselves to my crockery, smashed it and not said a word, I should hardly be surprised. 

&gt;My Uni somehow neglected to send me and a course-mate the email containing all the details about registering for our Graduation next month, meaning we didn't get any of the appropriate info in time and will most probably miss out and will have to graduate in July 2014.

Hmm. Is that going to affect your CV? If so, I'd ask for a written explanation/apology. A pedantic employer will spot that.

But she didn't really add anything special. She just pined after the Doctor and it was annoying. Rose was my favorite, probably with Donna coming in second. I'm not a huge fan of the Matt Smith era and his companions but I'd probably rank early Amy as third and then Clara. I hate River and the Rory and Amy relationship monopolizing a lot of the show, and that was a huge pet peeve of mine. Season One, Two, and Four with their respective Doctors and Companions are the best in my opinion.

Edit: Also regarding the cultural aspect of your theory... I don't think ones opinion of a companion is cultural but rather based on what appeals to that certain individual. Also I think gender plays a huge role. Men typically (in my experience) dislike companions when they are romantically involved with The Doctor. I'm not sure why. It could be that guys don't expect a lot of romance when watching a program like Doctor Who so when its forced upon them they retaliate. That's why Rose and Martha are probably the two most disliked companions. Rose was head over heals in love with The Doctor by the end of her run, and I think because The Doctor also loved her... It was okay. But a lot of people just don't like that much emotion and strength in a relationship in Doctor Who, it can be overwhelming. Martha is hated because she falls in love with The Doctor when its clear he will never see her that way, so it got annoying. Donna, and Amy don't try to pursue anything romantic with the Doctor and treat him as a equal. Giving what they get, and pushing The Doctor. which is why they are probably the most liked companions of new who.

true,jediknight437,null,null,"When Liverpool signed Brendan Rodgers as manager in 2012, few Liverpool fans knew what to expect from the overachieving 38-year-old tactician. Rodgers, however, has been well-aware of the looming expectation for Liverpool to return to the Premier League’s top four, and the Northern Irish manager is expected to deliver.

Rodgers became a public figure after leading Swansea to an 11th-place finish in the 2011-12 season. Although he surprised doubters with his team’s ability to hold its own and even out-possess some of the best teams in the Premier League, some were skeptical about whether Rodgers could translate that success to a bigger club. Rodgers’ teams were maligned for not being creative enough on the ball, and critics were quick to point out that even though the 2011-12 Swansea team averaged 58 percent possession, 31 percent of that possession was in the Swans’ own half of the field.

That perception changed this season, as Rodgers is currently in charge of one of Europe’s best attacking groups. Strikers Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez are tied at the top of the Premier League with eight goals each, while Steven Gerrard’s four assists put him at the top of that category. Liverpool is now being hailed as an offensive force, and the tactical adjustments that Rodgers has made to accommodate his attacking players show that he can be one of the best managers in the Premier League. The Reds, who sit in second place in the standings heading into Saturday’s derby match versus Everton, have proved they have an elite offensive attack. But will that be enough to push Liverpool to the top of the table at season’s end?

Here’s a look at the keys to Liverpool’s early-season success, how the Reds stack up against a tough upcoming stretch of opponents, and whether they ultimately are a legitimate Premier League contender that can earn a Champions League berth.

New tactics, formation

From his first day at Anfield, Rodgers encouraged his players to take defenders on and be more unpredictable in the attacking third. He quickly recognized that Liverpool provided a bigger budget to find these players, and as a result Rodgers’ teams began to put more emphasis on dribbling. His Swansea team in 2010-11 averaged just 16.3 take-on attempts per game, but in his debut Liverpool season that number rose to 22.8 per game, followed by a league-high 27.1 this season.

Consequently, Liverpool has dropped in overall possession from 57.2 percent last year to 53.8 percent this year. This implies that Rodgers is focused on having fast, skillful attackers capable of opening a defense -- and players like Raheem Sterling and newcomer Victor Moses, who is averaging 6.2 take-on attempts per 90 minutes, are   proof that. These players are designed to wreak havoc down the flanks for Liverpool, and as a result create more space for players like Steven Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho. But this shift in philosophy does not exist in a vacuum. Simply filling the wings with fast, skillful dribblers can stagnate an attack and, at times, leave attacking teammates stranded with fewer opportunities to impact the game.  

This is where Rodgers deserves credit for shifting to a dual-striker formation, which he installed as soon as Suarez returned from his suspension. Rodgers understood that both Sturridge and Suarez are aggressive, face-up strikers who are more than capable of turning and running at opposing defenders. So rather than tucking one player behind the other, or creating a roaming “false 9” position for either striker, Rodgers decided to play them in a dual-striker formation. As a result, Liverpool has been able to impose its offensive will on opponents, leading to more quality chances from the flanks along with a higher efficiency inside the penalty area.

Liverpool has exploded offensively since Suarez’s return, and the Reds have scored a league-high 16 goals in the six games that Sturridge and Suarez have played together. The fact that defenders need to account for both strikers makes it easier for players like Gerrard and Coutinho to become dangerous, and as a result Liverpool has been able to overwhelm its opponents.

Shot attempts (blue dots) and goals scored as a result (soccer balls) from the penalty area with single striker in first five games, left, and those with two strikers in last six games, right.
With Suarez and Sturridge posing a consistent offensive threat, Rodgers must make the necessary defensive adjustments to keep Liverpool in one of the coveted top four positions. The dual-striker formation creates vulnerabilities for Liverpool on defense, and with both strikers healthy, Rodgers is challenged with rotating the likes of Coutinho, Gerrard and Jordan Henderson without disrupting the defensive balance. Rodgers at one point attempted a three-man back line to solve the problem, as he thought it would be the ideal way to keep an attacking shape for Liverpool while allowing Lucas Leiva to give 33-year-old Gerrard more support in central midfield. In the four-game experiment, Liverpool conceded roughly two more shots per game than normal, including a combined 34 shots by Sunderland and Crystal Palace -- the two worst offensive teams in the league.

Unfortunately, the options to play behind Leiva were not strong enough to maintain a formation with three defenders, so Liverpool’s attacking players were forced to track back more than Rodgers wanted.

With a fourth defender back in the mix, Rodgers has settled on a 4-4-2, which I think is the best way to utilize his talent. Playing with an extra central defender will ease the burden on Martin Skrtel, who ranks ninth in the Premier League with 9.2 clearances per 90 minutes. And in the midfield, Leiva is available to play behind Gerrard, while Coutinho can play slightly behind the strikers on the left side of the field.

Gerrard/Coutinho touches
Allsport
Heat maps of Gerrard’s touches in 2013-14, left, and Coutinho’s touches in 2013-14, right. Red indicates increased frequency.
    

The heat maps show that Gerrard will stray to the right on occasion, which is why a 4-3-1-2 situation would create a problem for keeping Jordan Henderson on the field. If Gerrard does find himself in an advanced position, he is less likely to be in Coutinho’s way, and most importantly both players will always have a striker to play off of on either side of the field. Meanwhile, Lucas is allowed to play a support role behind Gerrard and also break up plays with his team-leading 2.7 interceptions per 90 minutes. The added defender should also make things easier for goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who has been forced into 23 diving saves from inside the penalty area, the fourth-most in the Premier League.

Critical schedule stretch, future outlook

Ideally, Glen Johnson and Jose Enrique will fill the outside back positions, but with Enrique about to have knee surgery, Rodgers will likely need to usher in a replacement on the left side. The timing of Enrique’s injury could not be worse, as the Reds face three critical away matches against Tottenham, Manchester City and Chelsea in December. And as good as Liverpool has been so far, the Merseyside derby this weekend is the beginning of a stretch that will likely determine their Premier League title chances and Champions League fate. Going into the stretch, Rodgers can actually consider the team’s 2-0 loss to Arsenal (its biggest test so far) as a blessing in disguise, as it prompted him to shift from a 3-5-2 to his more ideal 4-4-2 setup. Liverpool followed that that game with a thorough 4-0 win at home against Fulham, outshooting the Cottagers 32-4.

So now Liverpool must prove itself on the road, where the club has outscored every Premier League team except Manchester United since Rodgers began his tenure. The common denominator in Liverpool’s brutal stretch is that all four opponents (Everton, Tottenham, Manchester City, Chelsea) favor a 4-2-3-1 formation, making it easier for Rodgers to establish a game plan and reinforce any defensive adjustments in the team’s shape. Liverpool earned draws in three of its away matches against the top four teams in 2012-13, and actually created just as many chances in those games as in all matches away from Anfield last year, so there is reason to believe that with an improved offense Liverpool will be able to pick up points in these critical games.    

As it stands, Liverpool is a top-four team at the end of the year. But, as his tactical shifts indicate, it is imperative that Rodgers does whatever he can to keep his attacking duo happy. This means Suarez in particular, as his value is climbing with every goal. The Uruguayan star is keenly aware of his value to Liverpool’s top-four chances, and it will be interesting to see how things shake out if Liverpool struggles heading into the January transfer window.

For now, however, Rodgers can ride the wave of confidence that his strikers are playing with and focus his attention on building a defense that can contend for the Premier League title and compete at a Champions League level.",0,1385165101,null,0,false,0,cdku5ay,t3_1r8txj,t1_cdku5ay,t3_1r8txj,null,1428545659,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

The government could make an absolute fortune, here is a taxable commodity that can be home grown, people are going to smoke it anyway so what the bloody hell is the problem? On top of that the reason weed is seen as a gateway drug these days isn't because of the drug itself, but because it puts you in contact with drug *dealers*.

As a truck driver I once had something happen to me which is relevant. I'm driving down a road in a 44 tonne truck at 40MPH when I'm approaching a road on the left with a car sat at the junction waiting to turn right. As I get within 30-40ft the car pulls out. Because I was experienced I knew this was a possibility and had already planned an escape route so went over to the right of the road and passed the car which by that point had seen me and slammed all on, stopping broadside across the lane I'd just been in. Going on what you've said about the cyclist being in the right in having a collision that was completely avoidable, I'd have been totally in the right to continue the path I was driving, take no avoiding action and run straight into the car and wipe it out killing the occupants.

Long-Range Effects of Child and Adolescent Sexual Experiences Positive Review"", Allie C. Kilpatrick.

&gt;This book will be disturbing to many readers. The assumption that all children are ""damaged"" by their experiences is challenged by Kilpatrick's finding that 38% of the adult respondents reported the sexual experiences as children to be ""pleasant"" while only 25% reported them to be ""unpleasant."" **Kilpatrick also found that, although the majority of the women stated that the experience was initiated by the partner, for many (23% of the children 0-14 years and 39% of adolescents 15-17 years) the women reported having been the initiator.** Another surprising finding was that only 4% of the respondents reported that they would have liked to have had counseling.

Sometimes children initiate sexual activity with adults. Is it possible to initiate something, but not consent to that same thing? No it is not- it is logically impossible.",0,1385168482,null,0,false,0,cdkvcme,t3_1r69sd,t1_cdkvcme,t1_cdkiv3q,null,1428545098,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

1. Gerrard for leaving the space in midfield
2. Cissokho for poor positioning and reactions

true,newbill123,null,null,"Have you actually seen the stories with Adric (whether with the 4th or 5th Doctor). There was an air that the Doctor himself found Adric annoying; I think that is the biggest reason fans are pre-disposed not to warm to him.

As a character in continuity, Adric also had traits that annoyed fans. He stows away on the TARDIS rather than being invited. In the times where he tries to save another character, he might only wind up making the situation worse. He doesn't bring a true skill other than that of a math.

As an actor, Mathew Waterhouse has the opportunity to play a character that is sought by good and evil characters, and who has a family history of being something of a bad boy (though that disappears early on). Yet his actual performance and the focus on his 'leet math skills make Adric's internal conflict between good and evil as uninteresting as double digit accounting. Perhaps it's a failure of the actor, the director, or the script, but it's amazing how blank and un-emotional the character feels in many, many episodes while actually acting out what had the potential to be a growth ""arc"".

But to me, Adric feels like an engineered character. Take all the traits of a ""typical"" companion and turn them inside out. What's the real ""story"" of Adric? He just feels uninspired and unrelatable.

My only addition/replacement to your list would be (Get your downvotes ready, folks!) Rob Brydon.  Yes he has made me laugh, but there have been times that he so gets under my skin when he drones on and on about something insignificant and refuses to give it up.  He's not on my QI ""Dream Team"" certainly, although I loved his participation in the ""They Say of The Acropolis Where The Parthenon Is"" bit.  Absolutely one of the best scenes QI has ever aired.

Sorry about jumping in like that, but your comment reminded me that Clarkson has been on QI and how horrible he is at it.  My frustration level overrode my manners.

I'm torn between Three and Four as my favorite of the Classic Doctors. I lean more towards Three because I liked more of his stories than Four. Well... the ratio.

But they weren't canon until now and I didn't wanna invest the time it'd take to listen to all of them only to find out that they don't mean anything to the show. Ditto the novels, especially since a novel of Seven's ended up being the Family of Blood two-parter for Ten.
