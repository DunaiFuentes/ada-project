Judging by the way Rodgers' fitness regime has benefited Gerrard and Agger already I have full confidence that they can get Kelly working too, which genuinely would be like a new signing. Looking at his physique he appears to have bulked up considerably since his injury - maybe Rodgers has told him to since he's going to be deployed at centre back?

The great thing about having him playing there is that there is nothing he can't do. He's great in the air, he's strong, he reads the game exceptionally well and he is a great tackler/interceptor. Add to that the fact that he is comfortable going forward, is quick and can pick a pass and you have the perfect centre back for Rodgers' system. I think he would work amazingly well with Agger too, both are similar in style but one is left footed and the other right footed. Creates a nice balance. 

Seems like this could be Rodgers' master-plan considering we don't appear to be in for another defender anymore.

So the process for creating a Constitution is quite well-established -- generally all the major political parties and other (respectable) pressure groups will get together to do so.

Traditionally with a 4-2-3-1 formation, the 2 central midfielders will sit deep providing the 4 attacking players more space and defensive security.

These 2 players ideally will be a ball winning/holding midfielder, playing alongside a deep lying playmaker. Think of the De Rossi/Pirlo, Khedira/Alonso combinations.

Chelsea's central midfielders last season consisted of Mikel, Romeu, Lampard, Ramires, Luiz. 

Both Mikel and Romeu would fall under the ball winning/holding midfielder category. Romeu is now out on loan but we now have Essien back. It's still up in the air as to how effective Essien will be as he is clearly not the player he once was, so it's debatable wether we have actually strengthened or weakened the team in this area.

Lampard and Ramires are both very much box to box midfielders who whilst they can still do a decent job are really playing out of position in a 4-2-3-1 formation. New signing Van Ginkel also fits into this category.

Luiz playing in midfield is talented enough that he can play either role as deep lying playmaker or holding midfielder to a fairly high standard but looked shaky at times against the better opposition midfields.

Obviously there is still time for Chelsea to strengthen these positions with further acquisitions, but as it stands playing a 4-2-3-1 with our current squad is very much a matter of square pegs in round holes. 

A 4-3-3 may not be as fashionable a formation of late but it much better fits our squad.   ",0,1373967092,null,0,false,0,cb3nwc3,t3_1iefey,t1_cb3nwc3,t1_cb3nqrt,null,1430450565,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,TecTwo,scottish,Scotland,"The Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation who is appointed by Parliament but independent was given special authority to view the closed evidence of certain cases involving special advocates and said in his latest report (releases 2 days before my dissertation was due...) has said they are making a difference. I believe his statement because he has been far more critical of anti-terror laws than his predecessor so he's not a government-appointed lackey. 

I'll admit that this system is going to be taken advantage of by politicians trying to cover up mistakes or problems but the balance between more cases being heard and disclosure has to be struck somewhere. I am a believer in openness and disclosure but in some instances it can be damaging, for example national security. Now that JSA is in force CMP can be used in any civil act for damages. The principal areas where it could be very beneficial (in allowing more cases to be heard and morally so) are family law where abused spouses and children are to be protected; patent law where medical patents are in dispute; and another area I can't remember. Before CMP was only available in cases involving control orders. The Labour government attempted to curtail their use even in other anti-terror order cases such as terrorist asset-freezing but were unsuccessful. 

I was vehemently against the JSA when I first learned about it in 2012 but my constitutional prof made us think about it a lot and I can see its benefits and how it was pretty much inevitable. The good thing about physics is that you are all on one team ostensibly but the tricky part about law is that you have a veritable fuck ton of different view points from radical humanitarian civil libertarian to stone cold conservative. However the principle of natural justice is still being breached by this because it is not public. The problem there is that there is another principle called the sovereignty of Parliament which states that Parliament may enact any law it so chooses and is not bound by its predecessor. Some believe this to be stronger than natural justice (tends to be politicans complaining about the legal system) and some claim natural justice is a higher principle permeating all else (tends to be judges and legal theorists on the left). 

I still think if it could be done in public it should but as the current justice system stands, JSA was inevitable. (I'd link sources here but I'm on my phone).",0,1373967235,null,0,false,0,cb3nx1b,t3_1iclwo,t1_cb3nx1b,t1_cb3ml46,null,1430450556,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

ZFS is a ""next generation"" file system that has many cool things in addition to RAID, most importantly being the verification of all data. If a bit flips on some files due to a hard drive fail it'll know about it and be able to fix it (assuming you have redundancy). ""Silent Data Corruption"" is a killer, you don't find out about it until years later by which point it's too late, so ZFS will periodically scan itself and sort them out. I've also lost data this way so when I read about this stuff it was a no-brainer. 

In the old days you'd need to buy an expensive RAID card for this stuff. ZFS is entirely in the OS and you can throw loads of cheap drives at it &amp; and grow it over time.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"But there are several ways to play a formation. In Mourinhos first spell with Chelsea, he concentrated on defense, which lead to having the fewest goals in a season. With Carlos 433, Chelsea had the highest goals scored in a season. 

4231 can be played differently. Dortmund plays it with a box to box with Gundogan, even the Spurs with Dembele.

It's just about philosophy, rather than the formation.

Edit: I just don't understand why people are so hung up on the formation, specifically, the 433. It's as if since everyone is going with the 4231, we have to be different.

Most clubs are switching to a 4231 for a reason, even RDM and Rafa stuck with it last season. Maybe, just maybe, they know more than any of us?

I will only trust the government if truly independent scientists say ""Yes, we can do this safely and here is why"". Unfortunately our current climate of politics is fairly corrupt and the amount of business kissing major arse for their own profit is the primary reason to not trust this plan, regardless to ""Oh but we'll have better regulations in comparison to the USA."". That comes across as cheap propaganda to achieve a final solution and nothing more.

The track record of ecology damage by UK companies world wide is fairly blatant, they create problems and they don't give a fuck because it makes them profit and it isn't on their door step. Just look at the Nigerian delta as a quick example. 

You may call me paranoid or over concerned, but ecology is far far more important then anyones fucking pocket. You just need to look at how these companies are attempting to bribe the localities affected with pay offs, regardless to future generations.

You'll need to get used to accents. You can travel 20 miles and have an **entirely** different accent to where you just were. You *will* be confused by some of them (I'm from a place called the Black Country and I have to speak 'Queens English' to my American friends as they don't understand me). Don't be afraid to speak out if this happens. Some of us who have lived here all our lives struggle to understand certain accents.

Public transport isn't fantastic and can be expensive - where you can, advance book tickets. Always leave extra time. Getting around London is fairly easy though if going there. Make friends with someone that has a car and you're sorted though.

Make sure you get out of the city (if that's where you're based). There are some truly beautiful parts of the UK that you'll miss out on if you don't.

But there can be no doubt that with the players in the Chelsea squad they have under performed considerably in the league the past two seasons. What a lot of people identify as a root cause of this is that our midfield that used to be so dominant in the days of Lampard/Ballack/Makelele/Essien etc, now seems to regularly get outclassed by opposition midfield. 

Quite possibly this is a problem Mourinho might be able to resolve without the need to change formation, but on paper it seems the easiest way to resolve some of Chelsea's most recent woes. 

If he does decide to stick with a 4-2-3-1 a player of the likes of De Rossi will certainly go some way to help sure up the midfield.

Have you sat though the credits on an AAA game recently? They are already profitable with those huge Hollywood-level staff rolls. They really don't need to go beyond much that. 

And as game sales are soon to be driven by artificial scarcity in a downloads market the prices can be lowered as more consumers become available. Consider this: how many copies of GTA V will be sold to people living in old-age nursing homes? Then ask the same question in 30-40 years time with GTA XV. 

Also consider the end results of India and China's current modernisation. There are billions of available consumers coming online as we speak. The gaming industry is at it's most exciting time ever. We don't need to fake doom and gloom to get tax breaks, the standard approach of ""other countries do it, we need to be competitive"" is all that's needed. If anything that's talking the language of politicians far more than discussing the intricacies of AAA budgets. 

&gt; which is obscenely overpriced because at minimum wage it would take around 8-9 hours to pay for a single game

Compared to many other forms of consumable entertainment it's dirt cheap. You'll get maybe 40 hours minimum of entertainment out of a good game. Compare that to the cost of a DVD movie, a trip to the cinema, a sporting event or a concert.

Leave him alone? Did you mistake my polite message as some kind of harassment? You may be forgetting the bill of rights and british laws regarding right to privacy. But you surely aren't forgetting my right to free speech?


The spying and information gathering is done comprehensively and stored/analysed thoroughly, this includes weekends. And If I was to phone my wife and let her speak to my son on the phone the government would be storing the data of that call, despite me being at the cricket with my son. Do you see my point?


&gt; I'm sure you'd be pretty pissed if your boss called you at 2am on a Sunday to talk to you about work related things


Frankly that's an irrational comparison though I am happy to explain why.


* The job of the PM in a democracy is HEAVILY focused around public feedback. It is an inherent interest of his to hear peoples concerns and feedback. This is comparable to a hotel manager enjoying some wine in his own hotel bar and a guest to make a very short and polite remark on the quality of say his... toilet facilities especially if I had already told the appropriate staff and nothing had been done. 


* 2am on a sunday? That's ridiculous. 


* The reason I would break that 'speak to MP in his personal time barrier' is solely because of the immoral extent of citizenship spying. Additionally, if the government still don't recognise petitions, my MP doesn't reply and all other 'legitimate' channels fail. I would be **very** within my moral rights to question him in person.

Lord Neuberger, the new President of the Supreme Court has publically expressed his distaste for CMP as have notable others whereas one of the new justices Lord Sumption (who went from the bar to the bench of the Supreme Court in one jump with barely any judicial experience) is more in favour of it, although he isn't explicit in this.

I hope the situation will be similar to ouster clauses which have fallen into disuse because of judicial aggression.

Ask people you know how they got their job. The majority will say they just happened to be in the right place at the right time. They didn't take a course in it, they didn't study for it at university, they just knew an old manager from a previous job who was setting up a new business and was impressed with you during your time there.

&gt; The Joseph Rowntree Foundation published a study in December testing whether there were three generations of the same family that had never worked. Despite dogged searching, researchers were unable to find such families. If they exist, they account for a minuscule fraction of workless people. Under 1% of workless households might have two generations who have never worked – about 15,000 households in the UK. Families with three such generations will therefore be even fewer.

EDIT: because I am nice, here is another citation:

http://www.redpepper.org.uk/mythbuster-welfare-reform/

&gt; The academics Paul Gregg and Lindsay MacMillan looked at the Labour Force Survey, the large-scale survey of households from which we get most of our statistics about who’s in work. In households with two or more generations of working age, there were only 0.3 per cent where neither generation had ever worked. In a third of these, the member of the younger generation had been out of work for less than a year. 

&gt; When they looked at longer-term data, they found that only 1 per cent of sons in the families they tracked had never worked by the time they were 29. What’s more, while sons whose fathers had experienced unemployment were more likely to be unemployed, this only applied where there were few jobs in the local labour market. So ‘inter-generational worklessness’ is much more likely to be explained by a lack of jobs than a lack of a ‘work ethic’.

&gt; In an interview with Michael Parkinson broadcast on ITV1 on 4 March 2006, Blair referred to the role of his Christian faith in his decision to go to war in Iraq, stating that he had prayed about the issue, and saying that God would judge him for his decision: 

&gt; ""I think if you have faith about these things, you realise that judgement is made by other people ... and if you believe in God, it's made by God as well.""

([Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair))

I don't think I'm misquoting here when I suggest that he's differing his decision to go to war to... God? 

Then there's (along a similar vein) his close affiliation with George W. Bush, the fact he has taken the country to war more times than any other Prime Minster (and for an assortment of dubious reasons)... 

I believe another Redditor has described him as messianic - I'd say that's a very good description. It scares me that he has been *consulted* about Middle East matters since his retirement from his PM position when he has come across as power hungry and almost eager to enter conflicts as a show of strength (and to further that power).

The area I grew up in and spent most of my life in had very mixed racial groups and religions.

The press would never discuss that though and in a lot of areas I've visited, discussing a clash of cultures is considered insensitive and / or racist (which it isn't).

Racism works both ways, and I've experienced it first hand on several occasions in these deprived areas. There was a rather well known incident in my area where signs went up proclaiming ""no whites"" and ""X religion only"". They were quickly taken down by the police, and condemned by ""community leaders"" (several weeks later I might add).

So it seems that slightly less young people are drinking, but the ones that are drinking are consuming twice as much.

If you have to give someone £20k per anum so they can have a basic home in London, the issue is the cost of housing in London.  If you don't address the constrained supply, you simply drive the prices up further.  If there are only say 100 houses, and 105 families, that means 5 will loose out.

There are very few places on the planet with a better median quality of life than the UK, and even fewer that don't have some kind of subsidy not available to us (eg nordic oil). Unless you've decided to live in the southeast there's no reason a single parent with a child can't live off of £20,000 a year comfortably.

This is well above what one would earn working full time for minimum wage  and it's a limit set for families that don't have to pay for childcare. I'd say complaining about only getting £20,000 a year is entitled more than anything.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; As for housing in london, I'm not going to explain to you how you can't create land in a built up city. Housing in london is expensive because living there is better ecconomically than living in the rest of the UK. If you choose to live there, don't expect those of us in the rest of the country to pay you for the privilege.

I'm not talking about the rest of the country paying me for a privilege, as a higher rate tax payer I'm paying for them.  I'm only saying we've got silly rules about planning permission.  Want to convert that Georgian terrace in to *cosy self contained flats* no problem.  Want to actually build some purpose built designs, which don't suffer from the same pollution (heat, noise etc) oh no, can't have that.

We've got a system that encourages people to make slum flats, whilst we neglect to invest enough in transport to make access to the benefits of London easier and more affordable for all.

The price of a standard 2 bed around me, not even a nice one, is pretty much £250k, capped by stamp duty, the nicer ones go for £315+.  I don't see why we can't make environmentally friendly purpose built flats for that price, lets nock down some of these 40s terrace places that no one really likes, and build more efficient homes.

£266.

Anyway, why must everything make a profit? Can't we sometimes spend money just for the benefit of our culture and society? 

Also, it's a terrible line of reasoning because if you gave most people the choice to not pay tax then they wouldn't.

The opposition are made up of a disparate groups of factions. On the ground, hundreds, if not thousands, of brigades fight in Syria spread all over the country. Some are secular, some Salafi, some jihadist, and heck, some just trying to prevent their house, street, neighborhood from being bombed.

On a broader scale, the largest of these groups are the FSA. THe FSA are mainly formed of ex-SAA soldiers (around 60-80,000) who fight against the SAA. They are nominally secular. They are headed by the Supreme Military Coucnil and THAT's who the US/ Britain/ France want to arm. 

BUT that's not where the story ends. There are also other brigades. For example, Al Nusra, (6,000 fighters) who are Syrians fighting to establish a Salafist Islamist state (funded by Qatar). These guys use suicide bombings and summary executions to advance their causes.

Then it gets worse. There's Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIS) who are al Qaeda affiliates that want to establish an Islamic caliphate from North Africa to Iran built on Sharia law.

Black day is a completely different day; no blood and thunder so a lot of idiots stay away. Scarva has never caused any trouble due to the area it is in.

Gentrification happens ALL THE TIME, you can't pick up a paper in any city without reading about poor and run down suburbs that have been fixed up and made better.

If you can't see that coming from a mile away then I have no pity for you.

Same deal in Berlin. I know people who moved there almost 20 years ago. This was when you could buy *entire buildings* - as long as you could fix them up. So some smart people formed *collectives*, fixed the buildings up, and then anyone who bought into the collective had good cheap housing right in the centre of a major city.

For finding a job today, there are two things that you need 99% of the time: A phone, and a computer with internet access. The phone preferably needs to be mobile, since you can receive and make calls whilst you're out searching.

A smartphone costs, what, £30 - 50 on pay as you go? For that you've got a mobile phone that (with the wi-fi feature) also acts as a computer.

Thus, a smartphone is a better job-searching tool than a landline and a computer with internet access. It fulfils the roles of both for a fraction of the cost, and without the monthly internet / phone bills.

You make a good point about the lack of pure atheleticism and power in our defensive midfielders, and something I would tend to agree with.  Maybe I'm giving Eriksen a little too much credit in the hope that he'd be able to make a reasonable defensive contribution (much like Coutinho has when necessary).

I DO however suspect it was them given the length of tenure, and even it is wasn't them, again given the duration of tenure, they had a degree of responsibility to make good. The whole principle behind squatting is taking responsibility to care for a property. These people had not done that, and I do not know why you are defending them.

And I consider the wall damage I mentioned to be structural damage.

There is mold visible in the 5th photo, and probably damp.

If you choose to take such a simple route, you are actually perpetuating the oppression towards others.

Well, on regards to the cool toys or expensive trainers (which I also never received and am actually quite thankful for, because it broadened my outlook on life to think beyond styles or trends if you get my gist), most of these things tend to be bought at the local pub from some fencer, so very cheap. 

It's always cause and effect, no one persons life or story is as simple you are making out. 

Also, it's very funny that most of these 'piss takers' all live in the same estates or specific areas of the community, it's kind of like a self perpetuating illness, where once you land into this situation, getting out really isn't easy. It's like the supposed dream that if you work really hard you're gonna get rich, but from my experience the people who actually work the hardest and get most illnesses due to their efforts are the poorer members of society, just they tend to not get paid anywhere near as much for a much larger proportion of effort. 

On regards to your uncle, perhaps you should talk to him rather then complain eh? I mean I fucking hate Sky, but in some cases I imagine it's the only thing in some peoples live's which make them happy, better then getting pissed out drunk every night or robbing houses.

These people have the ability to make right that damage or to ensure that it doesn't happen, and they chose not too, therefore forcing the cost of their indulgence on to the public. And, moreover, taking the property out of use for a lengthier period, making the housing situation WORSE.

$$$s mean council homes being built. $$$s mean care services for the elderly and disabled. $$$ mean libraries, and nurseries, and rape support centres.

Wrecking something, and forcing the public to pay for it is just vandalism. 

Squatting provides people homes, in a country which has failed utterly on housing, generally at very little cost to anyone. It lessens pressure on shelters, and gets people off the street, often in safer circumstances. It is important.

The funny thing about the House of Lords is that it was and remains largely undemocratic, which is why Nick Clegg was so adamant that it needed to be reformed. But because they are not voted in, Lords are not political, and can look at individual laws from a common sense point of view. This provides a great balance against the House of Commons.

The antithesis is of course the US system where both houses are democratically elected, and look how well that goes...

I was pretty disgusted with how Nick Clegg tried to force reform through from an ideological point of view without regard to the House of Lords effectiveness. When he didn't get his way, he reneged his support on the boundary change legislation. This is something that all parties know needs reform (because you have constituencies that are based on very out of date population data), but because it disadvantages the Tories, he tried to use it as leverage - i.e. showing that he is only in support of democratic reform if it benefits his party.

&gt;You have bought into Daily Mail propaganda my friend. There is no generation scrounge.


If this is true then how come 12 out of the 18 girls in my class at school have already had 1 and some now 2 children, have never worked a day in their life and just mooch in really nice free housing, clothes, food and everything else from the state? This is in a fairly wealthy area in the South East of the UK (Chichester), and there's thousands more that I don't personally know in the local area. They don't have any partners and just get pregnant as quickly as possible after school to live off the state, they even get pregnant in groups all together at the same time and know they will get a house at the 5 month mark.

The problem is endemic, there's whole generations of young girls growing up believing that they never need to work a day in their life, don't need a man to support a family and just mooch off the state and create children who do the same. I know my personal experiences are just anecdotes but nearly everyone knows people who this, so the figure of just 5 families you have produced is total bullshit, we all know there is a serious problem.

This is even more infuriating for me because I was made homeless a while ago and I got absolutely no help as a single man from the state or local council. I was put on a housing list right at the bottom and was told I'd have to wait 2 years for a property, and all the local emergency shelters (8 places!! run by a private charity!!) were ""full"" and there was no money to make any more even though the government rules say everyone has to be helped. I was unable to get job seekers allowance, any work, have a bank account or be in any way involved in society due to my inability to get housing, and in my view I feel like women getting pregnant as a career choice are actually stealing from people who desperately genuinely need state help. If I was in government I would say that every child you conceive after starting to receive benefits entitles you to no more benefits, and would remove children from people who choose to do this.

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"Are there any reliable facts and figures on this? It seems like quite a politically charged topic and any attempt to gather REAL data seems to result in one of two conflicting conclusions. Lots of people will tell you that people on benefits are struggling and that they really need the money however lots of people will tell you that actually lots of them live quite comfortable lives. We know there are piss takers and we know there are people struggling in poverty. I think the real issue is the people in the middle who aren't trying to game the system but are simply getting what they are being given and as a result are able to lead relatively comfortable lives which I think ends up destroying peoples motivation to change things. If you get £26k a year or more in benefits what is the use in applying for a £20k a year starting salary?

Given the area that I grew up in, I find it hard to understand why I never met anyone living in actual poverty. I know it's anecdotal and I did grow up in London, so maybe it's a little different in other parts of the country.

I don't want to bash the poor and give em nothing, I think we need to have a social security system and I'm proud that we have it in this country. That being said I think it needs a complete rethink because we do seem to be creating generations of people out of work with little motivation to change. Any talk of change leads people to assume that you are a Tory and you want to kill all poor people...

I think a cap on benefits is quite reasonable given that we expect people to support themselves on less. And I don't think it's unreasonable that they might have to cancel their sky subscription.

1997 - 2000 was a continuation of Conservative spending plans. That was a big part of the New Labour manifesto in 1997. The Dot com bubble happened during that period, although it was mainly driven by hubris rather than the 'Credit Crunch' which was driven by cheap lending which continues to this day.

&gt;It was when the tax taking and other receipts started slowing when the problem set in, and you would never be able to predict a global slowdown. 

Taking the reigns in 2000 with his first proper spending review, the UK's budget deficit then rose every year from 2003 onwards, which is completely unforgivable during 'good times'. As a Doctor of Economic History he should have appreciated some of the most basic arguments of Keynesian economics (Don't run a deficit during good times, spend it during the bad times).

I don't think the answer is to tell people they're lazy and the only solution is for them to get off their arse, they tend to be individuals who feel trapped, worthless, mental unstable or have social problems. Implying they should 'Get off their arse' is forgetting that perhaps some of these people truly don't feel capable to do so, we need more social support and understanding to why these individuals exist or are encountering problems. Then attempt to find a way to integrate them, the job centre certainly doesn't do fuck all for anyone. Didn't ever help me when I required support.

My brother in law finds it incredibly hard to gain any real confidence to actively go out and search for work to attempt to manage other responsibilities in life, his finally been encouraged to visit a doctor for support by his parents, it turns out he 'might' get a social worker to help him, but it's very much a might. Now he will be a claimant soon and some point and probably won't actively get off his arse, but thats because of other reasons, not because his lazy or incapable, his one of the smartest people I know, just has social issues. 

To finish off, I think the cap implies that EVERYONE is in the same, which just isn't true.",0,1373993059,null,0,false,0,cb3uf35,t3_1iej4d,t1_cb3uf35,t1_cb3ssnn,null,1430447420,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

You're using emotive hypothetical situations which aren't relevant nor helpful to finding a logical solution.

Who is the man being beaten? Even the BBC news had a hard time containing itself when the reporter was walking around an Assad controlled zone in Syria, and the women were walking freely around a university with no headscarfs, celebrating their graduation day, something which the girls in the muslim rebel controlled zones are already banned from doing. 

The worst situation for the majority of Syria's population is that the rebels are allowed to win. I agree that Assad needs to go, but we definitely shouldn't be arming the rebels, I believe we should allow Assad to beat them and then send in the UN and UN member countries armies and use our military power to force hold free and fair independent elections, then once the new government is installed (which may even be Assad again if he fairly wins), we should use outside military pressure to enforce a stable government to prevent a situation similar to what is happening in Egypt.

The majority of the rebel fighters and their funding aren't even from Syria, and it would be morally wrong to enforce an Islamic government on a fairly secular population simply because a large minority of very loud very aggressive fighters were willing to beat the secular people in a fight.

true,morphemass,cnty-england,The Shed,"&gt;  If I was in government I would say that every child you conceive after starting to receive benefits entitles you to no more benefits, and would remove children from people who choose to do this.

Why not just kill the kids while we're at it to avoid the massive bills for state/foster care; the legal bills for all those parents who do actually give a damn about their kids but just happen to be in an unfortunate situation - I mean we HAVE to ensure that everyone is paying less tax so we have a more ""fair"" society don't we?

Oh lets not do that and lets just take the benefits away. What's that? Sudden massive increase in the number of children suffering from malutrition, reports of deaths and child abandonments, people begging with their kids in the streets, NHS services further stretched? But we're paying less tax, THATS what matters.

Might I also suggest, she may really enjoy some of the Doctor Who Audio Books. Several of them are narrated by cast members, including Matt Smith, [The Runaway Train](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-The-Runaway-Train/dp/1408427478/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374000006&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=doctor+who+The+Runaway+Train), [The Jade Pyramid](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-The-Jade-Pyramid/dp/B004IZU418/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374000048&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=doctor+who+The+Jade+Pyramid). 

Arthur Darvill (Rory), [The Night Of The Humans](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Night-Humans/dp/B003VXGADE) plus a few others. 

David Tennent, [Pest Control](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Control-Exclusive-Adventure/dp/1602837619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374000151&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=doctor+who+pest+control), as well as a few others. I really like the Tennent ones because he narrates in his native Scottish accent, but then fluidly flips to his Doctor accent for the dialog. 

Catherine Tate (Donna), [The Forever Trap](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Forever-Exclusive-Adventure/dp/1602838216/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374000206&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=doctor+who+forever+trap). Those are only a few of the great audio adventures. 

My favorite one at the moment is [Prisoner of the Daleks](http://www.amazon.ca/Doctor-Who-Prisoner-Daleks-Unabridged/dp/1602838224/ref=sr_1_59?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373999860&amp;sr=8-59&amp;keywords=doctor+who+audiobook) read by Nicholas Briggs, who does the voices of the Daleks in the new series, and he does a FANTASTIC Tennent impression. 

You can get the audio CD's from places like Amazon/Chapters or they have tons of them on the iTunes store. 

Some of these stories you can get in novel format as well, but what I enjoy about the audiobooks is the cast members narrating, the small but significant soundtracks, and the emotions you can get through voice but no in print. And hearing **""EXTERMINATE!""** is much more terrifying than reading it. ;) 

If you decide to go that route, I hope she enjoys them! I certainly do!

&gt;I'd like to have seen more diligence in making more arrests at the time

The police almost certainly don't do this because it will likely lead to casualties. Why try to arrest someone wound-up, armed with a sword, and backed by a mob of a hundred, when you can safely arrest them a few days later?

&gt;especially with the police just watching on

The way we played it this, it's hard to see how Torres could get more support. We had Mata playing just behind him, our wingers cutting inside to act almost like wide forwards and fullback overlapping to provide width. We're pretty much flooding the box with support. Granted, crosses by the full backs weren't that great, but that's not a tactical problem.

Climate change science is new. Scientists do not fully understand it as they have little little historical evidence to work with. They have no clear idea of why, for example, the surface temperature has plateaued. Maybe it's due to the seas changing due to ice melt. Who knows. What's not to say that in a few years time, there won't be an almighty leap in the surface temperature as climate change enters the next stage.

Listening to that interview and seeing those graphs reminded me of learning a language. You make steady progress and make huge improvements in that language. Bouyed by your progress, you start to introduce some more complicated grammar into your daily language and because you are focusing on that, your skills in the stuff you learnt before drops and it feels as though you're gong backwards. But after a few months, you're confident of how to use the new grammar and your old kowledge comes back to you and you leap ahead once it all comes together. Only to start the cycle again.

The whole process was very straightforward but I did subsequently run into problems with my bank.

I kicked up an absolutely huge stink and threatened to file a complaint under the terms of the Data Protection Act. The DPA requires any organisation that keeps automated records to keep them accurate and up-to-date so if there is any change in your details they MUST amend their files or they are breaking the law. Also, they have to have someone who is directly responsible for seeing that the DPA is being adhered to and they cannot refuse to tell you who, so you can say ""I need to know who in your organisation is responsible for data protection"" and they must give you an answer.

That aside, here's what I think.

The reason people on benefits are seen to 'have it better', in my opinion, is in part due to the fact that the Government by and large up until now actually treat welfare claimants fairer than the private sector would ever treat customers due to the nature of legislation.

When it comes down to products being sold to the highest bidder, you leave out the bottom end who simply can't afford it, such as in housing. Under welfare schemes for housing and whatnot, the government is providing something that by its very nature cannot discriminate against income.

The reason that the private sector housing market is in such a shambles is because of the complete absence of any notion of fairness. I don't think it's very honest to try turn it to saying that the government is being unfair to private owners through assisting people on welfare. I think it's a much stronger case to argue that the government should be trying to resolve the problems in the housing market so more people can actually have the necessity that is a roof over their heads.

On that topic, lowering the benefit cap is only going to achieve an increase in homelessness. Kids don't magically disappear because you've taken their money away, or at least they don't disappear in a manner that most people would find amicable. Debts don't vanish. What this drop would amount to is a loss of around £125 a week, but this is NOT a disposable cash loss. This is a loss in benefits paid to cover rent, unemployment, child support, etc.., assuming an individual is at the cap.

Frankly I feel the cap isn't worth the cost to administrate it. The benefits it affects are a tiny slice of the pie which is dwarfed by the pensions bill which will never be touched. 

If they want to do something right, they should be looking for ways to create sustainable work. They should be looking for ways to reduce the cost of housing. They should be looking for ways of making work manageable for families with children that may struggle. Individualism means fuck all when multinationals are mitigating losses through exporting labour elsewhere, and the answer is not to try drag the United Kingdom down to compete but to find a way to make businesses hiring here desirable on levels beyond just tax breaks.

Provide funding for individuals to receive training. Encourage long-term adults out of employment to go to University or take up courses. Enable individuals with partners in full time work to claim unemployment benefits and attend courses to get themselves feeling positive. They should relax how strict they are on volunteer working while unemployed, possibly even allow an individual to take on a work placement with a company and try negotiate deals with transport networks to offer subsidised passes so the individuals who are seeking these voluntary placements to get experience don't feel like the system is working against them. 

As it stands, morale is a massive massive deal to employers when it comes to hiring, and frankly things in the UK in terms of morale have been rock bottom since the Conservatives decided to campaign that things are shit. There's very little confidence in jobs being long term on anyone's part lately. Job security seems pretty high on a lot of people's worries just now, and that does not help.

This, coupled with how outdated the welfare system is and how much of a political football it is for point scoring just now is not helping things.

UKIP certainly have a good environment to prosper from with the coalition taking unpopular decisions and both europe and the economy are in bad shape. It's worth mentioning that the Alliance (SDP and Liberal party) once out polled both labour and the conservatives for a significant time but it takes a sustained presence for it to have much of an impact. 

It is always difficult to tell in the moment what is a flash in the pan and what is a structural shift but I have a feeling come closer to election time people will largely be focusing again on whether they want a labour led government or a conservative led government and the libdems will probably secure a smaller share of the national vote but mightn't see much of a drop in seat numbers. 

UKIP has a herculean task just to get one seat, they don't have the infrastructure, the professionalism or the money of the major parties and they certainly do not have local spots of power (their base is spread quite thinly across the country).

So what happens? The North Belfast MP and member of the Orange Order that represents us in Westminster repeatedly calls our Secretary of State ""deliberately deceptive"" for not exercising power over the matter. Asked kindly by the Speaker several times to withdraw comments. He refuses and gets thrown out.

The Orange Order call for protests with no organisation, no initial calls for peace and no communication with local residents. Confront PSNI in several areas. Riots break out for several nights.

Nationalist, neutral and even unionist (NI21) parties voice support for the Parades Commission yet the motion criticising it passes. 

I believe this issue could have been resolved by now with calm, level-headed dialogue between everyone involved. The Commission, the Order, residents and the parties. But sadly there are so many people here who don't want to compromise and don't even want to talk to eachother.

Don't get me wrong, I still shake me fist at the Merlin writers sometimes for not letting us see the Golden Age of Camelot and for Merlin never getting a huge, epic scene where he gets credit as he saves everyone....but I think the ending was bittersweet and perfect. It's tragic, but that was sort of the point, wasn't it?  Merlin told, and was accepted by, Arthur. He only did anything for Arthur, not for glory or fame. Merlin's honesty and Arthur's acceptance the most important thing to Merlin and Arthur's character development.

I also really loved the fact that we had the ending left open to interpretation, not a manufactured-sweet-wrapped-up-in-a-bow solution.

At the moment, if a married trans person wants to have their gender legally recognised, they have to go through a complicated process of getting an interim Gender Recognition Certificate, then an annulment, then a full GRC, then a civil partnership.  In future they can just get a GRC straight away, keeping their marriage.  Currently, people in civil partnerships effectively have to out themselves as gay/bisexual when filling in many forms (they usually have separate boxes for marriage and CP), possibly leading to discrimination.  In future, everyone will be able to tick the ""married"" box.  Religious groups can already offer civil partnerships, but they are apparently substantially different to religious marriage ceremonies (in terms of things like fees, and rules governing the ceremony and registered building).

Another huge impact is that by recognising same-sex and opposite-sex relationships under a single legal institution, discriminatory treatment becomes much harder to justify, both politically and legally.  Given some recent ECHR rulings, denying marriage to same-sex couples seems to be the only acceptable way of denying them the same rights as opposite-sex couples.

true,Omblae,UnionFlag,Surreh - Honda Hornet CB600F,"I had a 125 for a good year going up and down a fast dual carriageway - roughly a 35 mile round trip, one thing which really got me was that my 4T 125 simply couldn't maintain anything about 60MPH going uphill. That gets really dangerous when you need to keep up with traffic going 70-80+ mph on a fast dual carriageway - so much so that I avoided it and took the extra 9 miles going on the backroads despite the additional 20+ minutes. 

They can do carriageways, A roads etc but I would highly advise against it. Basically, I never felt comfortable not being able to get around lorries/get away from trouble - but if you can avoid 70mph limits then you're good to go - 50mph was the favoured speed of my 125 and it was a great deal of fun around that speed. On the plus side, great fuel economy - I was getting 70+ mpg out of my bike! 

As an aside, I recently passed my full test (A2 under the new licensing laws) and did so for £600 with a £50 theory (including all tests + CBT), bought my gear for £100 used off Ebay (had a helmet already from the 125) bought a bike for £1000 and insured it for £40 a month. Total cost is around £1800 all in - buying a 125CC and getting it insured + your CBT could very well cost you that as 125's have a ridiculous premium on them because they're so desired by younger guys. You can pick up cheaper 600's for much much less and that would negate the cost quite a lot. The test only took me one week to pass - if you're competent and listen to the instructors the test is also not difficult at all. 

As another aside, having my 600 (even restricted) is absolutely fantastic compared to my 125. Simply completely different leagues of fun and capability when it comes to cruising around/touring, but you do have to remember to be responsible with the additional power - if you've never had a bike before a 125 may very well be the way to start. I imagine if I'd never ridden a bike before, my Hornet would have been far too much bike for me. 

At the end of the day it's down to what you want from the bike - want something just to run you to work/to the shops and have a little blast around B roads on the weekend for no money at all? 125 will absolutely sort you for that. Want something that will actually get you wherever you want to go whenever, be comfortable for longer commutes + handle motorways better and have the ability to hoon around for a bit of fun when you feel up to it?

In seats which are labour vs libdem they are probably going to have a hard time securing their vote but in conservative vs libdem seats (and this is where most of their seats are) they have an easier task ahead. LibDem mps tend to be very popular with their constituents and they have strong activist bases in places where they have seats, removing them is not a simple task.

&gt; If they just made up completely new names and ids would you want to see them done for fraud as well? 

I shouldn't need to answer this because it is a changing of the subject but I will. It would be fraud because it involves forgeries but two things:

1. the police wouldn't do that because you can't hide it as a secret operation if there is an official paper trail: bang goes the plausible deniability hat upper bureaucrats like to hide behind. If the spies hadn't have been so dick-trigger happy we would never have known about them and their misdeeds.
2. the state would write laws of exemption making it a non-crime. Currently what they did was a crime but there will be no prosecution for agents of the state. 

On a slightly different note I think it totally abhorrent for the state to spy on its population in secret fashion because dirt bags love operating in the dark.

But yes they can because they are running around in secret with the stolen identities of dead children with little oversight and a willfully apathetic state.

Unless you happen to be found out. Why don't we have a donor system? All those parents willing to donate the identities of their dead children to the state can carry a donor card, or we could just make it opt out—what do you think?

These people will be dealing with what they think is a real person applying for housing, bank accounts, plane tickets, etc. 

&gt; You realise there is actually a good reason for using children outside of just doing it because they're all bastards and don't care about people, right? 

There is no official paper trail. One under cover spy was working for private companies and possibly even German authorities. There is no ""good"" remember state sanctioned rape. It's totally possible to have an open investigation, anyone being spied on (which is all of us re: PRISM/TEMPORA) should be told because you cannot contest an injustice if you don't know about it. You might say ""that defeats the point!"", and I would say ""what point?"". You might scramble to say something like ""catching bad guys"". I'd reply something along the lines of ""catching bad guys is orthaganol to creating a safe environment which is actually the real point"".

Those under surveillance become a risk to their peers and their utility and effectiveness takes a nose dive. The real reason the state uses secret spying is because it doesn't have to reveal who is being investigated and by whose order like Stephen Laurence—it's about keeping the public ignorant and misinformed. Do note no spies are being outed in the financial sector even though it's overflowing with corruption. No spies are being embedded in extremist groups like [Foundation of Conservative Students](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/16745/was-david-cameron-linked-to-hang-nelson-mandela-posters-in-the-1980s) who pushed out propaganda demanding Mandela be hanged, nor was there any in the BBC to out Jimmy Saville, or in those care homes, nor in the Catholic church to out abusers.",0,1374019530,null,0,false,0,cb44wi6,t3_1if87y,t1_cb44wi6,t1_cb44jc9,null,1430442408,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

1. While playing with Coutinho, they can interchange positions between LAM and CAM giving defenders a headache trying to mark.

2. Having two similar players that can play the same positions will give us insurance incase one gets injured, bad form, or tired.

no, not for me. sorry, i love the captain, but Liverpool absolutely dominated for such a long time that he can't really match up to the honours others won. for example...

Kenny - 

    Football League First Division (6)
    FA Cup (2)
    League Cup (4)
    Charity Shield (7)
    European Cup (3)
    UEFA Super Cup (1)
    9 major trophies
Stevie - 


    FA Cup (2)
    League Cup (3)
    FA Community Shield (2)
    UEFA Champions League (1)
    UEFA Cup (1)
    UEFA Super Cup (2)
    1 major trophy (2 if you count the UEFA)

at the end of the day sport is about winning, and Kenny was also pretty damned awesome/magical. having said that, there is no doubt he is the greatest Liverpool player of his generation, and probably in the top 5 of all time. in some ways playing for LFC is a curse, like being Jordi Cruyff.

This arises when matters concern their personal interests: either the power of the monarchy, or matters than impact the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall (or other parts of the Royal estates or the Crown estate).

This happens fairly quietly at some point during the process of the bill, and is known as the Queen's or the Prince's Consent. In this instance she indeed HAD such interests relating to this bill, and could have interfered with it's progression (though this would not have been made public).

However it was explicitly declared that she was placing such interests at the disposal of parliament for this bill.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; In another and quite different way, compulsory education is of service to eugenics. **The educational system should be a sieve, through which all the children of the country are passed,—or more accurately, a series of sieves, which will enable the teacher to determine just how far it is profitable to educate each child so that he may lead a life of the greatest possible usefulness to the state and happiness to himself**. Obviously such a function would be inadequately discharged, if the sieve failed to get all the available material; and compulsory education makes it certain that none will be omitted.

&gt; **It is very desirable that no child escape inspection, because of the importance of discovering every individual of exceptional ability or inability.** Since the public educational system has not yet risen to the need of this systematic mental diagnosis, private philanthropy should for the present be alert to get appropriate treatment for the unusually promising individual. In Pittsburgh, a committee of the Civic Club is seeking youths of this type, who might be obliged to leave school prematurely for economic reasons, and is aiding them to appropriate opportunities. Such discriminating selection will probably become much more widespread and we may hope a recognized function of the schools, owing to the great public demonstration of psychometry now being conducted at the cantonments for the mental classification of recruits. Compulsory education is necessary for this selection.

&gt; **We conclude that compulsory education, as such, is not only of service to eugenics through the selection it makes possible, but may serve in a more unsuspected way by cutting down the birth-rate of inferior families.**

Like all nice things from fine food to a good book, they should be recommended sincerely, not shoved down throats. Push Doctor Who too hard and naturally they'll see little reason to watch.

On that same note, don't oversell it. Doctor Who is great, but it's just television. If you try and act like the show's this magnificent life-changing spectacular they'll naturally be disappointed to find that you've grossly over-inflated your sell.

That all said, if they didn't like *The Eleventh Hour* then they probably won't be warming up to the Smith/Moffat era anytime soon. Many consider *The Eleventh Hour* to be one of the best Doctor introduction episodes of all time and certainly a great gateway into the tone that Moffat set for current-running Who.

But luckily, this doesn't mean that the baby must be thrown out with the bathwater. Doctor Who is a utterly *massive* show that renews itself constantly. You can not like one era or Doctor and still adore others, so introduction to RTD's era or any of the great jewels of Classic Who might still appeal to them.

If you want them to just have a short spot of fun with the show, why not show them *A Christmas Carol* (provided that Matt's not the reason they're so turned off). It's got good mass-appeal and is easy to bring out and share around yuletide (I'd recommend the one then-airing, but that'll likely be filled with so much continuity coming down from the 50th that it'll be positively impossible for newcomers).",0,1374025465,null,0,false,0,cb46wqw,t3_1ige3o,t1_cb46wqw,t3_1ige3o,null,1430441462,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Even on £1500, I bet you could get a 125 and all the kit.

Or if it comes to it, you could cycle whilst you get some cash to be able to buy the bike ;)

Here's some things you'll want to consider getting if you're regularly commuting and a little paranoid about leaving it places
Weatherproof gear - If you can, get something with liners that you can swap out. Fleece ones, rain ones etc
Massive chain and lock - Pragmasis or Almax chains, Squire locks. Expensive but definitely worth it. 2 metre chain will give you flexibility with where you can hook it up
Tailbag to keep the chain in - I've found the Kreiga US-10 to be perfect for mine. Maybe get something a little larger if you're wanting to keep other bits in there too.
2 pairs of gloves - Get an ace pair for riding - full leather jobbies, and get a pair for wet weather work. No matter what we like to tell ourselves, more often than not it's dry in the UK. I've been riding for a couple of months every day and only been in the (full on) rain once.

If you do end up buying the Raptor, then bear in mind you'll need to get that restricted too, I'd say at the moment it's probably out of your budget to get that sort of bike, unless you can find an awesome deal somewhere. It's not really so much the cost of the bike, but the insurance + gear too.

Going back a post, I've lived on a suburb near the Pennines for 30 years now, a pleasant-ish cul-de-sac of perhaps 80 homes. I know almost no one here—the next door neighbour died of too late diagnosed cancer a month ago and it took a trip on morphine to ring me for the first time ever some how mistaking me for his son. No one really knew what to do on his way to death or after because no one really knew him in life. His delinquent son also ~30, didn't know what to do so he ran up a 4k£ cocaine bill. Apart from his ""entertainment"" its all so sterile. This square is your lawn, this is your driveway, people pass silently in their angry growling cars, this bit is fenced off, people leave 10-20k obscenities on the pavements despite driveways and they get angsty because kids play ball or play round them. Actually in youth I had two sets of officers, the second in plain clothes, turn up and shoo my basketball playing off the pavement. This was at the behest of some nimfy ex-cop prick. To their credit the second set couldn't complain because I had elevated my flagged driveway to get around the bullshit ""I am causing a hazard to blind people blocking the pavement"". With in vision** 10 cars were doing just that.

I know more kids than I do adults because everyone is in their cars, nearly all refuse to use their front gardens, and I cycle so see the kids often. There is zero public space and zero collective endeavor. We've literally been cut up as a society and isolated. Mentally the rot sets in about 11.

I would love to see someone with a little more physical presence (though with the requisite Rodgers passing and movement qualities) to back up Lucas/play alongside him in DM when we need a bit more grit. I'm a big fan of Schneiderlin, but I don't realistically see any chance that Southampton would sell. Any thoughts?

The lack of movement at centre-back suggests that Kelly is going to be used more as a back-up CB than before - which I'm happy enough with. Skrtel may well be staying given the lack of noise on any moves, which again, I'm happy with.

Tbh, I expect us to be fairly opportunistic, in the sense of looking to exploit value offered by under-the-radar young talent. Likely not to be someone the media is chuntering on and on about.

She made one last appearance in a charity special, *Dimensions in Time*. This episode is generally rejected as part of TV canon by fans because it's widely regarded as being terrible, as well as because it merges the DW universe with that of Eastenders, a popular British soap opera series.

In the continuity of some books, she's unable to have children with her husband, so they adopt some children and they go on some adventures. 
In the Audio Adventure continuity, she *is* able to have a son with him, Alex. Alex only had one heart and and was unaware of his Gallifreyan heritage until he was visited by the 8th Doctor.

Hardly any of us *wants* to work, we all just want the income and security that employment provides. 

When we have millions unemployed, it's fucking pointless penalising the least-employable deadbeats and losers.

Those who have spent years too messed-up and ill-educated to work are not suddenly going to land themselves positions on the board of Vodaphone. 

When you squeeze people like that, they don't have the nous or the wherewithal to suddenly conform to our expectations of proper and right behaviour - instead they ask ""where do I get this £10 or £100 I need?"" and the answer many of them find is in turning to petty crime.

I'm pretty sure we could find provable correlations between crime and poverty - it's not cost-effective to moralise about laziness when there's no jobs out there, and we're just going to end up spending more on the penal and justice systems.

I can see where she's coming from and I agree that some of the RTD/Tennant episodes weren't exactly stellar, as well as a couple of the Matt Smith episodes. However, as someone that got into Doctor Who with the 2005 series, Tennant is my favorite. IMO, he was very good at both comedy and tragedy and brought that duality to the character.

Edit: The problem in Iceland was not sovereign debt at all; it was private debt. The holdings of the private banks dwarfed the national economy.

First, you're posting this request to a *very* narrow sub-reddit. Why specifically Edinburgh, why not ask all over Scotland or even all over the UK? As an American you should understand that the UK is relatively small. Commuting from Glasgow to Edinburgh is a well-worn commute, though not for everyone (read: me).

Second, how does being a US citizen have anything to do with understanding the ""enormity of [your] post""? This logic doesn't make much sense to me, unless of course I'm lacking certain information or perspective that you're willing to  enlighten me with. But it's the kind of misleading bullshit I'm always wary of when dealing with people I don't know because I feel like you're trying (impotently) to engineer the situation in your favour.

Third, your user account. You created your user account /u/holyroodfun at 0234h UTC and then made this post at 0242h UTC. No established account, no history, nothing. At best, you're trying to hide your intentions from other people who already know about your primary reddit account and monitor it; at worst, you're panicking and desperately trying to find yourself a position in Edinburgh as soon as possible. (I'll go out on a limb and say you're already in Edinburgh and you love it here and you need an employer to sponsor your continued presence in the country - I'm guessing you're either fresh out of University or you've just been put out of a job. The timing is odd though, 0442h BST, not a time you'd normally find a local up and on the internet and job-hunting... Unless they were desperate).

However, to answer the main thrust of the question I don't know of any open requisitions in Edinburgh for my current employers (and believe me I would, our office is small, our managers are transparent and unfilled resource requests are a big thing for us).

There are small offices for Amazon and Edinburgh knocking around the city somewhere you might try. There's also a Rockstar who could potentially be interested in your services but I don't have ny in-roads in either for you to make use of.

If you want to stay in the UK at all your best bet, really, is looking for a job in London and prostituting yourself to the finance market.

How many comedians/presenters does the BBC hire that are identifiably conservative? Jeremy Clarkson and Michael Portillo spring to mind but outside of that, I'd struggle to really name any. Given Clarkson IS Top Gear and that's one of their most profitable and successful shows, it's not like they're not capable of holding an audience.

Radio 4 recently admitted they don't have enough right leaning comedians on their programs. It's not like there aren't good quality right leaning comedians out there, if you go to comedy clubs you can usually get a good range. I'd guess that a lot of the BBC's editorial staff are paranoid that they'd hire a Roy Chubby Brown (the BBC have also been a bit paranoid over the possibility of causing offence which has neutered their comedy programming a bit but that's a whole different subject).

When a tyrannical regime can only keep power by having an overwhelming monopoly of violence over its people it isn't going to stop just because we aren't willing to sell them arms.

Your gear should be exactly the same cost whether you're riding a 125 or a 600, the bike being slower doesn't mean you can ride in flip-flops and a t-shirt - especially if you're commuting on a motorway.

Also, I'd be willing to bet that you can pick up a 600cc bike for much the same cost as a 125 because there's a captive market of 17yr olds that are forced to buy a 125 if they want to ride.. if you're old enough to avoid that cash sink it's worth it.. have a quick scout around ebay and compare the cost of a decent quality cg125 / ybr125 against the cost of a late 90s cb500, er5, sv650, hornet600, fazer600, bandit600 and so on, then go look up insurance costs also.

The only place you'll be saving money is doing the CBT against doing a full licence, but also remember that you'll have to retake your cbt every two years at a cost, and if you find you like riding you'll want to do the full licence anyway :)

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;I wonder how much automatic cars would cost.

It's an economy of scale thing.  Like the self parallel parking car, it has R&amp;D costs, but actual manufacturing costs are rather low.  The Ford one uses ultrasound.  10 years ago I was playing with robots that could self navigate using ultrasound, the cost of me building one of those would be about £50.  It's not hard, and it certainly isn't expensive.

I would question how well the ford one handles curbs and the like, I think it might well require the car that you are parallel with before you enter automatic mode to be correctly parked.  This is because I imagine they line up based on it, to calculate the correct angle to the curb.

The only remotely expensive part of such a system is the ability to steer the car.  But as the accelerators of most cars are entirely electric, it probably isn't far off having steering wheels which are too (Drive-By-Wire).  However I'm guessing for now they just used a more powerful set of motors / actuators on the power assist steering.  Again, this shouldn't cost much.

I wouldn't be surprised if the total cost of the system was about £200, to give a good margin (as insurance and R&amp;D need to be funded somehow).

The thing is, doing one manoeuvre, in controlled circumstances is easy.  Driving on the open road, with all the many different things the car will encounter is not.

Myself I think we are going to see the transition piecemeal.  Some cars already have radar/ladar assisted breaking, automatic cruise control that keeps a set distance from the car in front.  (this feature could be amazing at reducing motor congestion and the phenomena of breaking waves).  You not only have lane departure warning systems (which detect drivers falling asleep / not paying attention) but also blind spot detection and steering correction.  If you change lane on a motorway and there is something in the blind spot (DS5 uses ultrasound) the car simply won't let you change lane into it, without you having to overcome a haptic feedback (ie really shove the wheel, which will be pulsing).

I think the next area of improvement will be in feature analysis, some cars already have IR imaging cameras that can see in the dark without blinding the oncoming driver.

I actually liked Children of Men depicting a near future car, it when detecting something that had a likely collision (ie interception or CBDR warnings that some planes have) it flashes something on the windscreen to indicate.

nope, not saying that. i am saying that both players have massive talent, heart, drive....whatever, but at the end of the day one has a shitload more accomplishment as well as all the rest. also, Gerrard played in a very good team that didn't win the league.

i see the point you're making, but winning is the key, not how you lose. people who say it is the taking part don't either understand, or win. to make it clear (it wasn't well-written) they are both amazing players, but for me Kenny was at least as good as Gerrard (i think better) AND won more.

as a side-note, retrospectively saying Kd played in a great team only works because the players made it great. we'd be saying the same of the Xabi/Mash/Gerrard team if they'd won the league, and maybe should anyway.

That doesn't mean it'll be certified, commercially available, or even safe in 20 years. Plus, the google car data is inconclusive - yes, it's had no accidents while in automatic mode but how many accidents have been avoided due to the human driver being there? It also consistently holds up traffic. It's a nice demonstrator, but it proves nothing - the technology to make a car like that existed in the 80's (and there were trials back then).

People also make the mistake of thinking a car will just come along that is automated. This is not the case. Technology from these automated demonstrators will make their way to commercial applications, sure, but it will take a long time and it will be a piecemeal process. Each new generation of car will incorporate some amount of driverless technology. For example, now, we are seeing new cars begging to be equipped with automatic lane retention; you can't quite let go of the steering wheel but it uses sensors and makes small control inputs to keep you in lane.

The next big thing to be incorporated will be automated following - slaving your car to one in front. Basic examples of this tech already exist in some cars. 

These types of technology, some of which we've seen before (automatic transmission, automatic parking, cruise control) and some of which we haven't (formation driving, speed limit recognition, obstacle detection) will gradually be incorporated into new cars over the next 4 decades until, at one point, it would be standard for a new car can be called, for all intents and purposes, ""fully automated"", but you would still need a licence for at least a decade following that.",0,1374060260,null,0,1374060567,0,cb4f1xc,t3_1if3qp,t1_cb4f1xc,t1_cb4ewsd,null,1430437554,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

A local authority near me compulsory purchased my friend's grandfather's house (family home since the whole terrace was built, 1892) for a slightly below market value price to make way for a city bypass scheme. The bypass road never happened, they offered to sell him it back after it had been left vacant for a number of years.

--------------Reina (Mignolet)---

Johnson---Toure-----Agger----Enrique-

-----------Lucas-----Gerrard--------

----------------Coutinho------------

--Downing-------------------Sterling

-----------------Suarez-------------

So, why no Sturridge? Because I feel that he operates best in the central striker position, and yet Suarez also operates best in the central striker position. And it's obvious who is the better player, no offense to Daniel. And why Downing? Because he has finally convinced me, I really think he has been doing very, very, well on the right, especially paired with Johnson. I suppose it could kind of work out if we played Sturridge in Sterling's position and Aspas in Downing's then have the front 3 roam and interchange all the time, it could be quite the goalscoring threat. But if we're looking to feed the main striker while having options on the sides that are capable of being dangerous once in a while then I would like to see this formation.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;How do you rate Pritchard in comparison to other Tottenham youth prospects?

Of those who are yet to crack the squad (so disregard Caulker, Rose, Townsend and Carroll) I would rate Pritchard only behind Ceballos and arguably Mason. That is pretty good company to keep however and with Mason having a very poor loan last season it may just be Ceballos ahead.

He brings something to the table that I think can really benefit the spurs squad in a few years, he is perfect for a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1. Young dynamic players are always going to be useful and granted the apparent interest from clubs like Liverpool and Barcelona in Pritchard you have to imagine more than just spurs fans have had their eye caught by this guy. 

&gt;What are the best/worst aspects of his game?

Others have noted his potency with a dead ball and also his striker accuracy (will almost always opt for a curling placement shot over a power hit) but I would have to say the best aspect of his game is that he doesn't have one. He is the full package. Loves to take on the FB, excellent at drawing fouls / corners, can cut inside and deliver a beautiful end product in the form of a shot or cross and can take set pieces. Did I mention he can play in a large number of positions? My main criticism of Lennon is that after he ditches his marker out wide with pace he doesn't really convert that advantage into a shot/cross etc. Pritchard does (albeit at U-21/nextgen level), and that is why I rate him.

I have seen some people who spend a lot of time watching youth say that 'he isn't all that'. To be honest, I have now watched him a fair few times including games at championship, spurs youth and England U-21 level and I have to say the kid is a damn good prospect. I don't think it is a coincidence that Pritchard's substitution in the Next-Gen final vs United pre-empted the 'choke'. They couldn't handle him and McEvoy (a great player himself) just couldn't keep the pressure up.

I would say the worst aspect in his game is probably off the field. Now this is purely speculative, but we probably all remember the transfer saga in January with him not signing a new contract (allegedly) and possibly going off to Liverpool. Then a few weeks ago quotes come out from the Posh president that Pritchard wants to make a move there and doesn't want Swindon (against spurs wishes). I really hope this guy doesn't have a chip on his shoulder, a 20 year old shouldn't make the papers twice in 6 months over contract/playing issues.

&gt;Where do you see Pritchard in 5 years time, will he make it at spurs?

I am sold on Pritchard. I think he will no doubt crack the EPL in 2 seasons and the only issue for me is that his contract ends in exactly that time. Will he impress so much that spurs are blown out of the water from interest in bigger clubs and we can't get him to put pen to paper? Or will he sign another extension which will see him naturally replace the likes of Dempsey/Bale/Lennon. I hope it is the latter.",0,1374063364,null,0,false,0,cb4fkfh,t3_1ihakf,t1_cb4fkfh,t3_1ihakf,null,1430437241,10,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,10

Just for the sake of discussion, I'm aware this is far from reality, but to me Johnson and Enrique both have an above average offensive capability, not just within the set of defenders but also for midfielders. I am also aware this XI cannot accommodate Downing/Sterling/Ibe but ATM Johnson and Enrique seem way better to me. 

Also, subs according to me- Aspas for Coutinho/Suarez, Alberto/Henderson for Gerrard, Kelly/Downing for Jonson/Enrique, Borini for Sturridge and Allen for Lucas.

And of course Mignolet for Reina.
With the 'imminent' arrival of another quality CB, Wisom gets pushed to the bench.

But this leaves out most of the youth prospects on the bench, so in practice, this XI would be dissapoiting.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"I'd have to disagree; I think the 4-4-2 with Defoe/Ade up top didn't really work too well. We hit our stride as a team pretty early on; the game @ Old Trafford was a good example, and we performed very well through the winter playing a 4-5-1, even a 4-6-0 at times with Dempsey at ""striker"".

Moreover, how on earth do we have the players for a 4-4-2? Defoe and Adebayor are our only strikers, unless you count Dempsey, which gives us 3. Bale played his best cutting in from the right last year; go back and watch his goals, so many were R to L moves to push the ball onto his natural left foot. Unless you're playing Bale out of position at striker, he's not going to get those opportunities in a 4-4-2, especially because he does his best work a little further out than strikers usually play in 4-4-2; he likes to operate just in front of the back four, not among them.

4-3-3 is out best formation; it's what AVB has been building us for all last year; We have a positionally sound DM who can help bring the ball out of the back (Sandro, Paulinho, Huddlestone too, Parker if he learns positional discipline), we have a solid 2-way CM who can both tackle and create opportunities for other players (Dembele, Carroll, Huddlestone, maybe Paulinho &amp; Holtby too) and we have creative playmakers who aren't afraid to mark in defense and then break forward (Holtby, Gylfi, possibly Ceballos). What we don't have are 2-way wing players, which is what you need to play 4-4-2. Lennon is our best defensive wing, and he's really only good because he's fast and runs around a lot. Who's going to play on the left in that situation? Townsend simply isn't a good defender, he's never been asked to be one. Bale doesn't defend well either, though he's not horrible at it, and Dempsey is the same way, but playing him as a true 2-way wide player is a waste of his talents and energies.

Unless we're going to play a ridiculously attacking 4-4-2 with wingbacks and wingers, we really don't have the wide players for 4-4-2, and if we do play crazy attacking 4-4-2, we're going to get destroyed on the counter and in general because you simply can't play with just 3 to 6 defensive minded players and do well; the 4-4-2 is built on 2 rows of 4 defending, and we don't have the players to do it.

Finally; at the end of last year, against Chelsea and Man City, we played some of our best games without Sandro by switching in THudd at that defensive role, and going to a true 4-3-3 with Bale on the right, Lennon/Gylfi on the left, and Holtby/Gylfi/ Dembele at the top of a midfield three. It WORKS. Go back and watch the Man City game again if you don't believe me; AVB changes us into a 4-3-3 from a 4-5-1, and suddenly, we're all over them.",0,1374064107,null,0,1374064812,0,cb4fpog,t3_1ifosi,t1_cb4fpog,t1_cb42283,null,1430437172,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

It adds a layer of confusion and an air traffic control nightmare as well. The argument is that 1 airport should be the UK's ""Hub"" for people crossing the atlantic and going to the east and so forth. Trying to spread out internationals across the city then transport them across it adds problems and makes London the only city in the world doing this. Will it create an economic benefit ? With the best info up until 2040 it will, after which air line passenger numbers are un-predictable. Is it worth spending 30 billion on a new airport ? No, it would be mid to late 2020's before it's done and would only have 10 years of guaranteed good passenger numbers. A runway at heathrow is the cheapest option, the fastest option and the option that will make sure we can make more money from internationals and keep our position as the atlantic oceans european/ eastern gateway.

Housing is mostly private, you're using public power to enrich one private individual at the expense of another

Airports are also private, as are trains. Yet again, the power of the state is used to make the corporate cronies rich whilst further impoverishing the poor. There is no economic benefit in shuffling all the wealth into the hands of a few very rich individuals at the expense of hundreds of others.

The UK had a fantastic transport infrastructure until it turned on itself, now we have the freight on the roads when it should be on the rails, we have the people on the rails when they should be on the roads, and truly massive untapped bulk freight capacity in the canal system just going to waste.  We don't need more, we just need to stop misusing and ignoring what we already have.

You'll find that many agents (CJ Hole, Kendall Harper) don't tend to work around that price range, but others (Andrews, Besley Hill) do. They're all going to charge £150-£200 in agency/administration fees: going private can save you that money, but many disputes are easier to settle through agents, especially if the landlord is often unavailable.

Area-wise, you'd have to visit to get a decent feel for the place, but naturally there are family-focused areas and student-focused areas. Too close to Glos Rd and you'll find a lot of people parking outside your house to go to the shops; too close to the City of Bristol college and you will have a lot of students around, and currently a lot of construction lorries. Parking in St. Andrews is a nightmare, but the park is lovely. Southmead/Horfield/Filton can be rather boring, but you wouldn't be short on amenities and it's easy to get down to the centre. Bishopston/Redland/Cotham are expensive, but very nice areas - just check if you'd be in a Resident Parking Zone.

Transport-wise, of course if you have a car it would be cheaper to use that than pay for buses (weekly pass around £18). The question would be if you could be bothered to drive (and park!). If you don't have a car, the buses are better than people claim, and there are cheap cross-city trains as well.

He allied with Spain and Austria and cemented a relationship with Britain and Ireland through his marriage to Mary.  While this was welcomed in England, William realised that stability could only be achieved by resolving the constitutional crises that had occurred previously, so in return for the throne, he accepted a declaration of rights from parliament that significantly curtailed his powers.  For example, he could not alter laws or rule for long periods without parliamentary consent and he called for the legislature to convene on a yearly basis - he showed that he was willing to let Parliament rule without interference.  In return for this stability, he collected a steady stream of taxes to help fund his war in Europe.

Funny as the BBC just rerun the story from the Daily Mail.

3) [For those wondering what in the fuck Chelsea are thinking, bear in mind three things - First, in form and motivated Rooney is a world class, 30 goal a season striker. He may never get that form back ala Torres, but I suspect he will. Secondly, he's English, which is a huge deal marketing-wise for Chelsea. Finally, taking him from their main rivals is a huge coup for Chelsea. Imagine if United had signed Drogba in his prime.](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ih5i6/bbc_sport_wayne_rooney_manchester_united_dismiss/cb4eoip)

4) Top of the bunch is this guy still saying Rooney is ""one of United's top player"" so they will think about the deal. Really? Really? You don't see the irony in that?

So funny considering Mata is only getting a bump to 100k wages just now so this would not only be a profit in terms of 10m+Mata but it would also be a profit in terms of wages, they would get rid of a shitty attitude and get a great focused player. They need a midfielder they would get for a player they have an upgrade of, they would take away Chelsea's player of the season for 2 years, the base of their midfield trio and their most influential player. If you watch football and you will never believe this rubbish so that explains most of /r/Soccer believing it, even arguing when told it is b.s.


But most of all I want to DDOS Daily Mail. They started the Ivanovic story, they started the Luiz story and now they started the Mata story even when Chelsea denied it. Mourinho went as far as denying all 3 of them leaving but still they are getting page views with this outrageous crap and the flock of sheep at /r/Soccer are happily providing them all the ad-revenue they need to keep running this shit against us, ruining our transfer window.",0,1374066739,null,0,1374067416,0,cb4gb01,t3_1ihb8y,t1_cb4gb01,t1_cb4fmb7,null,1430436893,24,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,24

This. 

A local shop closed down where I live a couple of years ago. The shopw had been there for a long time and was well respected. The owner blamed it on the Internet. But the truth is:

* His records were too expensive (don't see how piracy has much to do with his price tags)
* The owner wanted to cash out (fair enough but don't blame it on the Internet)
* You couldn't listen to albums. In my mind the guy utterly failed to understand (or decided not to) that people want to give it a spin before they're gonna spend their cash. It's only fair considering the sheer amount of bands out there these days and prices the shop owner was practicing. Yet you couldn't listen to anything most of the time. In the end, you'd come back home, listen on the Internet and order from Amazon at a better price.

These days, for me to go to a shop and spend money in it, I need more than just the product. So i'm really happy these Derby guys consider bringing the discussion back into the shop.

i tend to agree, and was basically taking that Gerrard is on the level technically that any of the greats were, and then looking beyond that. a lot of people talk about being in a great team, but that is a retrospective judgement, and basically just a summation of what they ended up winning at the time. 

as for the votes, that is r/soccer, but there are some really good subs too. i was just sad to see that on r/lfc, but not really surprised.

talking about the impact on the team is interesting, you're right. for me another consideration is consistency (wins leagues) vs bottle (wins cups). i think if you were to level on criticism at Gerrard it is that he doesn't produce as consistenly, or hasn't, as league monsters like CR7, although he's worth 3x as much in a CL final.
