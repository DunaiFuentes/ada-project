What would you call it then if said cousin entered rehab, did everything (or almost everything) the doctors prescribed - much more than any other patient in the same rehab - and got clean, but in the process totally fucked his liver and kidneys, and now he isn't willing to destroy even more of his organs without some help, and the doctors talk about the lazy cousin who won't get his shit together who needs to be punished (or rather, who ""betrayed"" them by finally saying ""no more!""), and then in his desperation the cousin offers his right lung, too, but that isn't enough. Because the doctors strongly believe in the ""organs need to be privatised"" ideology and now the analogy has broken down a bit. But in any case, that's the reality of the situation.

Greece has been extraordinarily compliant with all austerity measures (prescriptions), more so than any other country (patient in the rehab), like the UK, which abandoned austerity when they saw that it was fucking up their economy and are now growing again; they have cut public wages by 42% (not considering tax raises here; the real wage loss was larger; that's the liver gone); they have cut pensions (kidney 1); they have dismantled their health care system (kidney 2) which was once among the best in the world so that now the most vulnerable - long term unemployed people - have no insurance at all; they have privatised everything not bolted down (spleen?); a third of the people, and half of youths, are unemployed (large intestine?); a fifth of them can't afford enough to eat (small intestine?); they have increased taxes (stomach?); they have refocused on export instead of consumption (esophagus?), and then they voted in Syriza in the hopes of getting some relief, and now Syriza felt forced to accept *further* austerity measures (right lung) before the talks broke down again because this is about punishment and ideology, not helping Greece. That's also why the plans of Greece to go after *rich* tax dodgers wasn't met with a lot of jubilation. 

All the while even the IMF acknowledges that not a single prediction of the advantages of austerity and the development of the Greek economy was correct - austerity doesn't work. 

Syriza, despite being left-wing, never suggested dropping austerity all together of taking back the implemented measures. They want to restore human dignity to people. They want people to have enough to eat and basic health insurance. They want to enable people to actually consume things, because no economy can grow without consumers.

Ich erinnere mich noch, wie ich als Teenie Ende der 90er in meinem Zimmer Radio gehört hab und über die Quäkstimmen von Eißfeldt und Denyo lachen musste, als die brandneue Single [""Liebeslied""] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFM8zb_pJR4) der Absoluten Beginner über den Äther lief.  

Davor existierte HipHop auf Deutsch für mich nur am Rande. Klar, einzelne Künstler hatten in den Jahren davor immer mal wieder Erfolg mit Deutschrap. Die Fanta 4 und Fettes Brot sogar ziemlich beachtlichen. Einiges davon, wie z.B. Jein oder [Tag am Meer](https://www.tape.tv/die-fantastischen-vier/videos/tag-am-meer) fand ich Klasse; [Rödelheim Hartreim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80vFBNAbEgk) und [Schwester S](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I7JOglOqtM) wurden schon allein auf Grund geographischer Nähe zu Frankfurt gefeiert.  
  
Als Kind vom Dorf kannte ich selbst amerikanischen HipHop eigentlich nur aus den Charts bzw dem Musikfernsehen/Radio. Und da gab es zwar auch immer mal wieder guten Ami-HipHop - das unglaubliche Fugees-Album, die posthumen Gelddruckmaschinen Tupac und Biggie (letzterer von Puff Daddy maximalst-eklig verwurstet, California Love war wenigsten ein fucking guter Song), Coolio war im Gangstas Paradise, Nas träumte davon die Welt zu regieren... 
Absolut regiert wurden die Charts aber von Liedern, die sich zwar HipHop nannten, aber nicht so sonderlich viel damit zu tun hatten. Amerikanische Soldaten trafen auf mittelmäßige deutsche Produzenten - vor allem [Toni Cottura](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Cottura) - und das Ergebnis war der Euro-spezifische RnB/Dance Sound von [Nana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJHMtOXNFhk) (Hamburg), [C-Block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5dWnsTTyII) (Rhein-Main) oder [Down Low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7ZO8mM4Vfw) (Kaiserslautern).

Fand ich nicht so prall, aber während all dieser Müll in den Charts rauf und runtergenudelt wurde, entwickelte sich im Untergrund eine wahnsinnig talentierte, kreative Szene. Die schließlich ab 1997/98 auch bis in die Dörfer vordrang.  
  
Und auch wenn ich, wie eingangs beschrieben, beim ersten Mal hören noch gelacht hab: die Quäkstimmen der Beginner wurden mit der zweiten Single ""[Hammerhart](https://vimeo.com/20363113)"" mein ständiger Begleiter.  
Dann ging das Schlag auf Schlag, als ich entdeckte, was die dreizehner Mongo Clikke und andere schon erschaffen hatten und was in kürzester Zeit noch folgen sollte.  

Bis so 2004 hab ich alles aufgesaugt. Dann kam die Zeit, als zuerst Westberlin Maskulin um Savas und später dann Aggro Berlin um Sido und Bushido den Mainstream bestimmten, das Text- und Technikniveau (gefühlt) immer mehr abnahm, die Konzertbesucher aggressiver wurden, meine vorherigen Helden immer uninspirirteres Zeug ablieferten (Samy, Dende, Blumentopf, ihr seid gemeint) und ich sowieso viel mehr auf Reggae/Dancehall abgehen konnte (das waren die Anfänge von Seeed, Gentleman und Rootdown, das [ging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZASp8DPE1sU) [auch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIvXjkocnAU) [auf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou_vXsUpQhs) [Deutsch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E8kwZInH4U) [4 Links]).  

Seitdem beschäftige ich mich null mehr mit der Szene. Was früher von vielleicht ein, zwei Künstlern repräsentiert wurde, ist heute gefühlt ein ganzes Genre. Da komm ich nicht mehr rein. Und die Möglichkeiten neue Musik zu entdecken sind so vielfältig geworden. Ich war früher über Wochen mit Napster auf der Jagd nach den einzelnen Songs eines Albums, heute hab ich Spotify. Total geil, aber führt auch dazu, dass ich ganz Vielem keine zweite oder dritte Chance gebe.  

Allgemein spiegelt Rap mMn immer sehr das Lebensgefühl von Jugendlichen und Jungmännern wieder. Beides bin ich nicht mehr, daher fühle ich auch so Stücke wie ""Malcolm Mittendrin"" nicht mehr so. Auf Englisch, Französisch, Spanisch, Wolof, Koreanisch etc stört mich das gar nicht so. Aber Deutsch ist halt meine Muttersprache, da achte ich mehr auf den Text.    
Und viele neuzeitliche Beats sind mir irgendwie zu bombastisch und überladen. Naja, voll Geschmackssache. 

All das bedeutet ja auch nicht, dass ich nicht immer wieder mal über gute neue Sachen stolpere. 

Ich mag, was die Antilopen Gang macht, Danger Dan, Fatoni, Edgar Wasser und Juse Ju. Politisch, intelligent und trotzdem gute Beats und Flows.  
Huss &amp; Hodn, sehr geil. Käptn Peng, nice. Alligatoah, ganz groß stellenweise. Kollegah, Motrip, was so viele andere hier schon genannt haben. Alles okay, auch wenn ich kein Album durchhören kann. Cro hat n paar feine Sachen gemacht.   
Ich finds allgemein schön, dass es mittlerweile eine ganze Riege von Rappern gibt, die sich selbst nicht zu ernst nehmen. [3Plusss - Ich habe Hip Hop nicht verstanden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i22LCaGMG4c) sei da mal stellvertretend genannt. Vor allem weil ich nicht raffe, wie man bei Stieber Twins an New York denken kann lol.

Ich feier Savas, [Azad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPEpZMcta2E) oder [A.i.d.S.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_kJ1xV7K7U) Sachen, die wir früher aus ""ihhh, das ist so GangsterFuckBitch-Stumpfsinn"" abgelehnt haben. 
Ich mag Karate Andi, vor allem auf [Bockwurst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN5RnowED4U). Auch bei Rap am Mittwoch.
 
Wenn die Stimmung passt, geht auch Assi-Rap wie Haftbefehl, Celo &amp; Abdi, Farid Bang. Aber meist eher in so [Halt die Fresse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3lU9TdY2sU) oder [Meine Stadt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VArjLv84blg) Representer Tracks, die sind lustig. Oder halt [Eintracht Frankfurt Ultras Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNqjySRBOBk). [NUR DIE SGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1h6axX-IRg)!  

Seit einigen Jahren bin ich harter Fan der [Verrückten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fWnnN1PESQ) [Hunde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF-K_vOYSoo). Ich feier die schon seit [Rollo &amp; Foxn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5OSVDK6t0)s 1000 Bars Mixtape. 

Und zum Abschluß noch ein ganz, ganz, ganz großer, wichtiger, guter Tipp: **[Kinderzimmer Productions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIfc7KeUrKM)**.  
Am besten mit dem ""Wir sind da wo oben ist"" Album anfangen. Die noch älteren Alben sind zwar auch geil, aber gewöhnungsbedürftiger.  
Ihr könnt mir entgegenschmeißen, wen ihr wollt, niemand [übertrifft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ikIPXLGAVE) [Textors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0fIKBr2vN0) [Textgenie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBfg9aG9Fm4). HipHop übernachtet nur bei ihm!

Und neben dem Textmassiv hab ich noch ein paar Kostproben aus den Neunzigern mitgebracht:

* Junge was? Die Massiven! Bevor sie peinliche Kommerz-Cruiser wurden, brachten die Jungs aus der Kolchose den richtigen [Kopfnicker Sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce2_W4ew-OU)!  
* Freundeskreis hatten als erste in der Riege mit A-N-N-A richtig Erfolg, der Song galt aber als viel zu poppig, um erst genommen zu werden. Auf dem gleichen Album findet sich aber noch ""[Wenn der Vorhang fällt](https://www.tape.tv/freundeskreis/videos/wenn-der-vorhang-fallt)"". Nach ""Fenster zum Hof"" dürfte Wasis Part einer der meistgesampelten im deutschen HH sein. Jede Zeile trifft.
* Erst war es der ""[Eimsbush Stylee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaIosBgAoys)"" - immer noch einer der besten Tracks der deutschen Rapgeschichte - dann ging es [""Mic Test Eins-Drrei""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtiD3n4Qok) mit Joni Rewind und Tropf gemeinsam in den Rapolymp. Da tingelt er wohl bis heute rum, auch wenn ich mir nichts mehr angehört hab, was Samy nach 2004 gemacht hat.  
* Weil ich alle drei jetzt erwähnt hab, hier ein bombiger Kollabo Track: [Stieber Twins, Samy Deluxe, Max Herre - Malaria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIkA628zqsw)
* Curse machte einen auf Moses und brachte die [10 Rap Gesetze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bAD9-MnepY)
* ""Der stufenschlechteste Abischnitt bringt die Party mit"" - die Texte von EinsZwo's Dendemann suchen ihresgleichen. Das war schon auf der Sport EP zu hören, die das absolut grandiose [""Ich so, Er so...""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HipRgfljK-g) beinhaltet
* Das erste Mal, das ein deutscher Rapsong den **ganzen** Club zum Bangen gebracht hat: [Die Reimemonster Afrob &amp; Ferris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Jxe_cEx_w)
* Von Abseits der Norm, mit Vokabelsäbeln in allen Grössen, Schattierungen und Formen kam [Doppelkopf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhx382_NAYw). Storytelling deluxe für alle Verhängten. Und Falk hatte noch nen Riesentrack auf der Styleliga Compilation: [Tapir Joint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msrg6TRiWX4)
* Die vier fünf Leude von Fünf Sterne hatten [Penus Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWKfJXUbpTo), brachten jede Menge Spaß und haben nebenbei [den besten Rapcomic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A38aIf-jkj0) Deutschlands abgeliefert :D
* Deutschlands bester Freestyler kommt aus München. /u/johannL hat Main Concept schon erwähnt. Ich möchte das nochmal sekundieren. David Pe hat [ganze Shows durch gefreestyled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSGs4lIyr_o) und ganz sicher mit den [größten Wortschatz der Szene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDwhlqeT0Js). Immer noch mein Lieblingstrack: [Der 58er](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pm0O8CA0ws)
* Tone, verantwortlich für den allerersten [Disstrack auf Deutsch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPmXmhNOxL0), zeigte 2005 auch nochmal, wie man generell gegen [Ekelerregende Raps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn-J1xx9y8M) flext
* [Creme de la Creme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEr8ESDekYs) haben es nur zu einem Album geschafft afair. Aber [Porno Funk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AealkMwAog) war dafür ein großer Wurf.
* Alle wollen nur was Essen: [Zentrifugal ft. FlowinImmo - S\(n\)ex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vKtI0en0hE)
* Can't forget the Pott boys: [Weisst du, der Ruhrpott is unendlich](http://www.myvideo.de/watch/6377720/Abs_ft_Creutzfeld_Jakob_Onanon_Dike_Weisst_du) - auch [Unter Tage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5OYPVp0if4) oder [in Ketten](https://vimeo.com/97235689)
* [Mutter Natur \(Dendemann, Nico Suave, Maju Biese\) - Nicht Zum Nachmachen Gedacht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSSfQBCWANU) &amp; [MajuBiese feat. FlowinImmo - Quak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxjGuvY1V8Y)
* [Total Chaos - Das Mic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZCTOdj4oSg), um mal einen Österreicher zu Wort kommen zu lassen. Im [Alpenpanorama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6cYNVs-bgY) auch mit den Kollegen von Blumentopf &amp; Texta, was später zur [Kaleidoskop LP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaEwMIk3ER0) erweitert wurde.

Clearly, they do not want Greece to fail.  Having said that, Greece did a lot of things that caused them to be in the situation they are in.  And if they don't change those things, then they aren't going to get out of the situation.

It's like having a deadbeat child who racks up $50k in credit card debt.  Just paying off the card solves nothing.  Neither does giving them a loan to pay off the card.  They need to fundamentally change their habits.

Greece's problems have precisely nothing to do with faulty policies freeing up funds for Germany.  Greece's problems have been decades in the making and systemic and entirely unrelated to Germany.

And why would it be Germany or the EU's job to help Greece clean house in regards to their problems?  Your post illustrates the very core problem here - Greece needs to take responsibility for Greece.  They are behaving like a spoiled child who wants their cake and they want it now, and if they are forced to eat vegetables, they will stamp their feet until someone listens to them.  Greece's way of doing things has provably failed.  It should be no surprise that cronyism, tax evasion, retiring in one's 50's, corruption and nepotism is not a good way to run a country.  But you are suggesting the blame lies with someone else.  Who else could be to blame but Greece?  

As for the European project - it's generally just fine.  Greece lied about their situation to get into the club - and despite the wealthy people in the club trying to be altruistic and help them out to stay there... Greece didn't want help, they wanted charity.  Not just charity, but endless charity.  Without strings, without repercussions, without responsibility.

They wanted what they have had for the past few decades... a gravy train that won't stop.  That's not how global economics works, and now Greece is going to have to face the music.

Let them suffer - they made their bed, let them lie in it.

null,false,joavim,ESPA,Spain,null,"&gt; I don't believe (heh) that you can say that something has different connotations (not only ""negative"" ones, but meaningful ones) and mean the same.

I'm a linguist, so perhaps I'm taking a ""radical"" approach at this. Connotations are not related to the literal semantic meaning of a word, but to its social and cultural implications. The explicit meaning of a word is its *denotation*. Its implicit social or cultural associations are its *connotation*.

&gt; Pure agnosticism (non believers) and Agnostic atheism (atheists) are both part of the irreligious group of people regarding religion. But their instances are not the same, so you can be one, or the other. So they are not the same.

Again, I disagree with your classification. Non-believers are people who do not believe (in God). That is the basic definition of atheism, or if you want, of ""weak atheism"": lack of belief in God. You can certainly be one *and* the other. In fact, you pretty much *have* to be the two in a literal sense. 

&gt; You could argue, of course, that an atheist is also a non-believer, but I think that denying the existance of anything to believe in is far deeper than that.

Ah, now it becomes clearer. You seem to hold the view that atheism = hard atheism (the strong denial of the existence of any gods). Many people hold that view, but that is not the necessary meaning of the word atheist. An atheist is simply someone who doesn't believe in any god. 

I certainly don't think your definition is accurate though. An atheist is certainly not someone who ""denies the existence of anything to believe in"".

The conflicting statements, the questionable question in the referendum, the position of NO/YES on the ballot, would make one question about the aims of the government. They also do not accept that this is a case of EU vs no EU. The violations of the parliamentary rules. The most eyebrow raising fact is that the Syriza MP defense line against the question ""What if they are not bluffing"" (i.e. people vote NO and the creditors consider that as a Grexit), the MP's either more or less call scenario science fiction or that they are intentionally scaremongering. 

I personally understand that many people actually believe that a Grexit is the only solution (I think this is false especially given our geopolitical situation) but the way this government seems to go towards that way is questionable.

&gt; The fact that Greek government yields were just as low as Germany during much of the 00s is due to this unnatural policy intervention assumption.

The Greek government both wilfully misrepresented their financial situation to join EZ and completely made a mess of managing the money they loaned from the banks during the pre-crisis years. A more prudent country would have grabbed the opportunity to invest in itself and its' people; Greece did not.

&gt; Now we see that when the music stopped in 2009-10, the Eurozone players made a mad dash to bail out their bad investments by pumping Greece full of unsustainable bailout loans.

Unsustainable!?! 3% of GDP in debt servicing is FAR from unsustainable; most other countries pay the same and aren't virtual failed states.

The failure of Greek banks, should the bailout not occur, would directly impoverish Greek citizens.

&gt; German leaders chalk it up to moral failures when in reality this whole charade was a spineless reallocation of Greek assets in order to protect western European financial interests.

When you see words like spineless, you know propaganda is in full play. It takes two to tango, and the loans given to Greece was misused by their government when it could have been used to accelerate growth. 

Blaming the lenders and ""evil big banks"" is the easy and lazy way out, and really shows the incompetence of the Greek government. Mark my words, they will continue to fail regardless of the outcome of the referendum until they start addressing structural problems instead of funneling their energy towards the blame game.

Today the Global and Diaspora Programme for the commemoration of the 1916 rising in Ireland was announced. This will be a week of celebration of Ireland, it's diaspora around the world and commemorate the rising against British rule in Ireland 100 years previous. 

It will be mainly in Ireland, the USA, the UK and Australia with smaller events in many other countries. The UK events will be focused on our shared history and how we have moved from the rising to the present where Ireland and the UK have a brilliant relationship with the UK been our strongest and best allie.

The Rising in 1916 was a military failure but caused a huge shift in Irish public opinion to British rule and in 1919 after a general election in which the Sinn Fein party won a huge majority they then refused to take their seats as MP's in Westminster. They instead set up their own Government of the Irish Republic as declared in the 1916 rising. By 1921 this government with it's armed forces the 'Irish Republican Army' or IRA (Not the terrorist group that appeared later with the same name) had won the war of independence.

Since Ireland became an independent dominion of Britain (Like Canada and Australia) after the war in 1921, was partitioned in 1922 and cut all ties to Britain becoming a republic in  1949 we don't have one set independence day so instead celebrate the event where the Irish Republic was first declared.",null,0,null,1435615048,null,0,false,0,csmv4q0,null,t3_3bk60x,null,t1_csmv4q0,null,t3_3bk60x,null,null,null,1437447467,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

Um... the EZ countries have guarateed cheap loans to Greece. Meaning they, or more accurately the taxpayers of the EZ countries, will pay if Greece does not. That's what guaranteering other's loans means: you get to pay if the debtor does not.

The only country that managed to get *collaterals* regarding the second loan package was Finland. I remember it raising certain amount of scorn among our peers in the EZ not the least by Greece acting insulted for such lack of trust on their honesty and willingness to adhere to their obligations (never mind that Greek parliamentary committee just declared those loans criminal and illegal).

The collateral is a small amount of money deposited on a closed account with the purpose that within 30 years it will grow equal to the amount of the original capital lended. Currently the value of the collateral in the account is about 930 million €, and in 30 years it likely will grow to cover what we were stupid enough to lend to Greece in the first place. Meanwhile, we'll be cutting *our* pensions.

Those are peculiar beasts, they are extremely short-running and a country just repays them and loans them again. They are basically a buffer to make sure bills can be paid all year round when most taxes are paid e.g. quarterly. That leaves about 4bn ""real loans"".

For the rest of the year, another 6.8bn T-Bills are due and 11.9bn ""real"" loans. So, that's roughly 14bn ""real"" payments - roughly **8% of GDP**. That's of course still freaking high and that's why the 18bn from the programs and from interest Greece already paid but could have gotten back were so important. From next year on, the interest payments are much lower (can't find the numbers right now), they should be in the the range of 3.5% of GDP - the target primary surplus that played such an important role in the negotiations.

The thing is, Greek debt can no longer grow, because no one would loan them money. Therefore, it can only request more money from the troika or cut expenses/raise income or default.

* Because of low interest rates and long debt maturity, Greece spends less on servicing debt that Italy.  Do you think Italy should default?

* Should Italy and Portugal borrow money at 2.38% and 3.02% respectively to lend it Greece at &lt;1%? And then not see any of it?

1. Greece today is per capita richer than Greece 20 years ago.

2. Germany today is per capita richer than Germany 20 years ago.

4. [Almost every country in the world, and certainly every capitalist country is per capita richer than they were 20 years ago.](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)

5. You can replace the 20 with 40, or 60, or 80, or 100, etc. and everything I just said holds true.

The only zero-sum thing in the world are its resources. How we use them and what we're able to do with them is what makes us all wealthier despite having limited resources. We used to have problems growing enough food, until the Green Revolution hit, during which the agricultural techniques used by the developed countries of the west were spread to developing countries in Asia and Africa. The resources of all those countries didn't change but their crop yields did, and since then the only famines that have taken place were caused by bad government policy, not a lack of food production. Pick any industry and the same thing will almost always hold true. This is even true with non-renewable resources.

[Here is a map showing GDP growth rates around the world in 2010.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Gdp_real_growth_rate_2007_CIA_Factbook.PNG) Notice anything interesting? Almost the entire world's GDP is growing, albeit slowly because of the global recession. How is that possible if our resources aren't increasing? I mean, the few places that aren't growing are not really large enough or resource-rich enough to be fuelling global growth, which means that almost everybody is getting richer and it's not at the expense of others.

[And here's a page on the Gross World Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product), which shows the entire world's combined GNP and its change over time. Again, notice anything interesting? It's been increasing constantly despite the resources on our planet not increasing.

[Last but not least, here is a chart showing global GDP growth from 1500 to the present day.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/World_GDP_per_capita_1500_to_2003.png) Guess what economic system began to dominate the world around the time the world's wealth began to spike?

Just because the rich are getting richer **DOES NOT** mean the poor are getting poorer. Going by literally all the data, the global historical trends from as far back as we can tell up through the modern day shows us that actually, the rich have gotten richer and the poor have also gotten richer. Yes, this can happen in the immediate short-term, but in the longer-term it has never happened even once in modern history.

null,false,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,null,"&gt; It doesn't look like you thoroughly read the paper you linked, which reinforces my points. The graph in page 28 shows a very sharp drop in capital flows circa 2006-7, dropping from 45% to less than 5% of GDP. If you don't call that a drop, then I'm not sure what qualifies.

I don't have a problem calling that a drop, not having said there wasn't a drop coming up to the crisis. I know you said there was a drop at that point, and I know I'm arguing with you generally, but that doesn't mean I disagree with everything you're saying!

What you were saying that I was disagreeing with was that high bond yields on the periphery drove core investment money outwards, and that this was both a design feature of the euro and a big feature of the pre-crisis euro period. I said that didn't make much sense, because the spreads were larger before the euro - spreads reflect risk, so if they're an accurate reflection of *perceived* risk then the perceived quid pro quo in terms of risk/return remained the same.

You then said that the flow of capital would even out the spreads, the capital flows would then slow, and that this process happened during the post-euro convergence period, basically 2000-2003. I pointed out that the facts show less capital flow then than later, which would seem to me to contradict your theory. That the convergence period starts well before the introduction of the euro (from Maastricht on, basically), and that that pre-euro period is not marked by large capital flows seems to me to say the same thing.

That there was a pre-crisis peak in about 2006 which then dropped sharply off is irrelevant to what we're arguing about. You did make the point that market capital flows are dependent on investor sentiment, and can reverse or stop quite suddenly. I didn't disagree - indeed, don't disagree - but that has nothing to do with the claims I'm arguing against. 

Again, I'm not disagreeing that there *were* capital flows from the core to the periphery. I'm just saying that I don't think the size of them had anything much to do with the differences in bond yields between the core and the periphery, either with the spreads as a driver of such flows or with the flows as drivers of the spreads. It's a neat, common-sense idea, like water finding its level, but the data simply don't support it. I think you have two separate processes at work, not one neat one.

At this stage, I can't remember what all this is supposed to show about the Greek writeoff, though.

Dart has a certain reputation, which they're keen to uphold, and if it has so happened that they have bought your gov bonds at discount paying them some hundreds of millions at the face value is far cheaper than declining. Because what they can and indeed will do is perfectly legal but not pretty. 

For some reason Argentina did not understand this, and in some cases still keeps fighting the losing battle over peanuts while they have had far more pressing matters to address.

For the same reason, a lot of chip-and-pin machines only recognize Italian cards as mentioned - in my experience about 50% of the time for my non-Italian card. Presumably because the banks have not signed up to whatever international networks that are out there.

If you're so upset by what idiots say and you want an independent monetary (I think you meant monetary, not fiscal) policy that badly, go for it. Just go in with your eyes wide open knowing what the consequences will be.

And remember, implementing your own monetary doesn't mean your new currency will be stable nor does it mean anyone outside Greece will accept it (because let's be honest, there's no way they ever would). That means Greek imports are going to become a lot more expensive, although it also means Greek exports will be cheaper. The only problem: Greece doesn't really export very much, but it imports ~50% of its good and ~80% of its energy.

So the Greek GDP will fall substantially, an extreme form of austerity will have to be implemented, pensions will have to be slashed, savings will lose most of their value, almost everything will become more expensive, Greece will be cut off from international money markets and unable to borrow, **but** Greece will have control of its monetary policy.

The actual upside is that potentially in a few years, Greece will have some modest growth again. Of course, [Greece also had modest growth in 2014](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp-growth) so it seems like a lot to sacrifice for something you already had, but it could be long lasting if the Greek government manages to balance its budgets and institute reforms that increase Greece's competitiveness post-default.

null,false,vleejk,null,null,null,"Both yes, and no. I have mixed feelings. I can see that there was a need for reforms that would cause a hell of collateral damage(it has costed even lives). Although everything was done with the mindset of correcting mistakes of the past, and avoiding even bigger damage. Of course it was done based on the man-eating rules of todays world but that's not the point. The programms didn't work, yes, we got some ""virtual"" primary surpluses, some of the numbers were looking good. 

Numbers are numbers though. Numbers are looking good for Brasil, numbers are even looking good for Gambia(see what i did there? :P). Numbers don't mean nothing though, when you see how people around you live.

Unemployment is an issue, but what numbers fail to grasp is, for example, undeclared(I don't know the right term in english-I mean when working without a contract) employment, where people are forced to work longer hours, earning maybe lower wages, and they are not protected in any way. Even in normal employment, the bosses are taking advantage of the need of people for work to make them work for less, for more hours, no overtime, extra days per week without payment and, of course many cases of working for months without any payment. The troika in this matter forces more and more reforms towards aiding this situation in Greece.

This was just an example. Competitiveness is an issue, for which, we made so many reforms towards. But how can a Greek company compete with other european countries, when the loan she gets from a Greek bank has interest rates several times higher than other european banks. How can the Greece compete in the tourism sector whith those VAT scales. How can Greece build up a stronger primary(again i don't know if this is the right term in english) sector when, with the new troika program, what is left on farmer's priviledges(which would serve as an urge for people to take on farming).

How can the Greek goverment fight tax evasion, and collect more taxes, when they are so underhanded and not allowed to build a better system for doing so(because it will cost money). And then, there are people that have to chose between paying their taxes, and feeding their kids. People are forced to being ""criminals"", in not paying their taxes in order to survive. And this leads to higher vat, higher tax rates, in every single possible thing you can think of(a common joke between Greeks is that, if they could put a tax on the air we're breathing, they would).

And after parts of troika institutions admitting to making mistakes on the Greek matter in the past. We get, once again, the same kind of reforms, expecting different results. 

A quote from Einstein was ""Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."" Well, I don't think the Troika is insane, so I'm assuming these are the results they are looking for. There is not a real ""success story"" to the IMF. Every country ever supported by the IMF, was destroyed. Europe chose to hide behind it. At least that's what Greek people used to think at first. Now we have a game of hide and seek, of European leaders claiming to be inapossite and saying every matter should be discussed with the troika, and troika saying we have to follow the same recipe. Greek people have started to feel like the IMF is just an excuse for Europe in not taking real action towards solving it's own problems.

Then the people elected a new goverment. Not because they believed in them, reversing the austerity. But because they promised to at least try finding a way of really solving the problem, together with Europe. They also elected them in hopes of bringing to justice those people who are responsible for Greece's current situation. People who are still part of the parties that talked, negotiated, implemented the reforms, and suddenly turned from corrupted, to pointing their fingers on the Greek people about their past. They are also the people that the European leaders like the most. Because, in order to stay in power, have the will to say yes to everything, no matter how destructive it could be.

And, it's clear as day, even themselves say it, that the troika is asking more from the current goverment than it would from the previous ones. The Greek goverment made huge steps, stepping over the bounds of what the Greek people had asked them not to, more than one time, only for the Troika to push for more. Greek people have started to think they're being humiliated and punished because they elected a goverment that would try to convince the current way of solving the problem is bound to fail again and again. They have also started to feel that, what the Greek people see as succeeding(starting to grow, being able to pay off our debts on our own) is not what succeeding means to Europe and the IMF. We feel like we're becoming an example, for the whole europe to see. No one should question the EU norms, or they get crushed. An example to the people of the south mainly, who face similar problems, but would never want to get to our point.

And to tie all these up to the thread. Contrary to popular european opinion, these past years most of the Greeks blamed themselves, the past goverments, the banks, the whole system that forced reforms on the weaker people, all while leaving those with money unscathed, and those who played a huge role on todays situation unpunished. But they didn't blame the European citizens.

Now, while browsing here I see claims of ""lazy greeks"", ""mad Greeks"", ""freeloading Greeks"" and ""Greeks blaming everything on others, thinking nothing is their fault"" we hear people pointing their fingers at us, blaming us for EVERYTHING that was ever wrong in the eurozone while saying ""they think everything is the others' fault"". How ironic is that? 

We just want you people to understand us. Every time I see someone hating, I feel like more and more like I'm drifting towards a place I'd never want to be. Me, and many people I know. Have started to feel like an animal when put into a corner. Even if there are good intentions, we won't be able to get it. We feel unsafe, and started to feel indifferent to our future. The feeling of being opressed is starting to take over. Thoughts of freedom, and not accepting anything will start to emerge. 

Greek people are very fond of their history. We've been ridiculed for that as well. But we're not fond of just our ancient history, the modern Greek history is full of cases of the Greek people fighting and die against foreign and internal invasions, opression and occupation. It's inevitable that ,while cornered, a big part of the Greek people will instinctively go into ""resistance mode"". Then, we'll start fighting and killing each other(greeks killing greeks i mean).

Das gute ist, das thema ist so wichtig, da schreiben ganz viele darüber. Von Zeitungsartikeln mal abgesehen (die sind einfach nicht so gut) gibt es viele (wissenschaftliche) Artikel und Dokus.

Ich versuch es mal und schneide nur einiges an, ich denke so 100% Antworten gibt es auch nicht, da sich ja immer noch gestritten wird.

Griechenland fehlt wohl ein erheblicher Teil an Steuereinnahmen bei den Reichen, dort zahlt einfach nicht jeder. 
Das Geld was da war ging auch in die Wirtschaft und den Staat, kürzlich fing die Wirtschaft dort wieder an zu wachsen. 

Zudem ist das Geld was eigentlich zur Hilfe gedacht war wohl eher in die Banken und Investoren geflossen, damit diese sich nicht erneut verspekulieren. 
Ob Grexit zur Stabilität hilft bezweifel ich. 

Wer Schuld hat ist auch schwer zu sagen, Tsipras versucht die Scherben seiner Vorgänger aufzufegen, jedoch nicht länger auf dem Rücken des Volkes, was wohl auch gehen würde, nur nicht den Vorstellungen der EU entspricht. 

Man könnte die Schuld eventuell auf einen zu frühen Eintritt Griechenlands in die EU schieben.

Andere sagen, Merkel hätte das ganze vor Jahren verhindern können und diese Jahre waren nur dazu da, dass Kapital zu verschieben.

Vielleicht wirft das ganze etwas Licht auf die Sache, wie es genau ist erfährt man ja meist erst, wenn es vorbei ist.

Zum Rest:

&gt;Erklär mir doch einfach, inwieweit die subjektiven Wahrnehmungen angesichts der Abwesenheit eines objektiv feststellbaren Unterschieds einfach als irrelevant zu betrachten sind.

Die subjektive Wahrnehmung des Textverständnisses ist irrelevant für das tatsächliche Textverständnis, eben weil es keinen direkten Zusammenhang zwischen Textverständnis und empfundener Verständlichkeit gibt. Oder anders: Dass man gefühlt was verständlich findet, heißt nicht, dass man es tatsächlich versteht. Und wenn von zwei Leute, die von einem Text gleich viel verstanden haben, einer glaubt, der Text wäre leicht verständlich und einer, dass er unverständlich wäre, ändert nichts daran, dass sie gleich viel verstanden haben.

Auf die Studie bezogen ist es wichtig, dass die Ergebnisse der Studie nicht mit einer Forderung nach einer spezifischen Formulierung einher geht. Es handelt sich erstmal nur um eine Betrachtung des auffälligen Umstandes, dass das Verständnis von Texten (das sehr ähnlich war) bei Männern mit stark unterschiedlichen Wahrnehmungen der Verständlichkeit der selbigen Texte (die als unterschiedlich verständlich wahrgenommen wurden) einher ging.

Beaucoup de Français font du French bashing, c'est d'ailleurs souvent vrai pour les plus euro béats. 

&gt;Les Allemands exportent des voitures. Ils continueront à en exporter avec l'€ qui baisse (sauf en Grèce).

Oui mais leurs ventes sont moins dépendantes du prix. Leurs ventes vont moins augmenter que les ventes de produits français en cas de baisse / sortie de l'euro. C'est la sensibilité au prix qui veut ça. 

&gt;Les exportations françaises ne vont pas magiquement devenir plus compétitives. Nos concurrents sont espagnols et italiens pour qui l'€ baisse aussi.

Alors si les exportations françaises vont devenir plus compétitives grâce aux prix, l'Espagne et l'Italie ne produisent pas les mêmes biens que nous ils seront également plus compétitifs mais tout le monde y gagne. Elles n'ont pas non plus la même structure économique ni la même sensibilité aux prix sur leurs exportations. 

&gt;Ca arrange peut être un peu Airbus mais ça représente peu dans le PIB français.

10% de baisse de l'euro c'est autour de 0,5 point de croissance en plus. On le voit d'ailleurs en ce moment les prévisions sont toutes à la hausse d'environ 0,5 point par rapport aux prévisions précédentes. Maintenant tu peux considérer que c'est peu ou pas, c'est subjectif.

The issue is this, the creditors want Greece to pay back the debt while under-taking more austerity and more unemployment when they are already in a  state worse than 1920s American Great Depression, far worse actually if you look at the real numbers. 

I personally though EU/IMF would realize that Greeks have crossed the line of ""I dont give a fuck any more"" and try to make a deal which loosens up some of the austerity(not all ofcourse) and agree to a deal which Tsipras has proposed that is basically ""Austerity-lite"". 

The question is not that Greeks do not want to pay the debt back, ofcourse that is the best option . .but not while the demand is to continue this raging Great Depression which is destroying society. 

Is it not possible to find a middle ground? Apparently not, since this has now become something more than ""debt and economy"", I am not even sure what it is any more, but it is leading Greece to a Grexit because if there is a choice between continuing the Great Depression for another decade or exit and try to stand on your own 2 feet, the answer is very very simple.

Il punto è che ai greci, che votino si o votino no, non cambierà nulla della loro vita: saranno senza ospedali, non avranno i soldi delle pensioni o di chi lavora nel pubblico, chi è nel privato ha già metà o più di metà stipendio in meno tra aumento di tasse, meno lavoro e varie, sono già impoveriti da far schifo, e lo saranno anche in futro, con l'euro o con la dracma.
La colpa **è anche** dell'europa, oltre che alla grecia truccatrice di conti in passato e al pessimo uso all'italiana della PA , attenta solo ai conti, ai differenziali, alla moneta e quasi più nulla alla solidarietà tra europei, alla comunità, al ""tutti uniti per reggere alle sfide globali"". Non si fanno scrupoli a strozzinare impedendone la crescita economica a forza di rimborsi e tagli chi è poco rilevante nei bilanci continentali (una banca sudafricana citata dal Post ha detto brutalmente ""L'Europa deve pensare a lasciare il 2% del suo PIL a fare default, e concentrarsi a rendere più forte l'altro suo 98%"", pensiero che sembra essere ormai lo stesso dell'FMI quantomeno che più che un ""ente di soccorso"" sembra una banca dedida a ricavare il meglio dai suoi ""investimenti""), mentre a chi nel 1989 gli sono stati abbuonati svariati miliardi di debiti di guerra e di obbligazioni statali per poter assorbire le perdite per la riunificazione tedesca per una causa ""superiore"", no.

Yeah, no.

Wages are more than twice as high in Greece, whilst rent is only 10-33% higher and most basic goods are hovering around +60%.

That really doesn't compare.

null,false,VERTIKAL19,GERM,Germany,null,"&gt; The referendum is whether or not they are willing to accept the bailout package

That bailout package is off the table tho because the greece government left the negotitotaions. Nobody is saying the greek can't do their referendum it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The consequences of a greek no vote to me are quite clear. It will be a defaulting of greece and because they simply don't have euros anymore they will be forced to introduce their own currency and there we have our grexit

&gt;The politicians have been consistent in their insistence that ""there is no formal legislation to remove someone from the EU/EZ""

There is no formal legislation to expulse someone from the EU/EZ.  Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty says ""1. Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements."" so greece could very well exit the EU and EZ as their own decision. It is just that our german government cannot say Greece has to leave the euro and kick them out of the euro, but the greek government can exit it.

Why should I not have an oppinion on what will happen? Isn't that one very democratic value in itself? Also I am really sure that this referendum is all but ""one of the most democratic things"". It will be executed democratically, but primarily this is a vote that either will cause Syriza to fall or will cause Syriza to stand with probably an exit outo f the EU and the EZ.

If the price of alleviating life for the Greek in the streets is that a couple loans get repaid some years later, isn't that worth it?

Either outcome of the coming referendum as it stands is going to cause resentment and mistrust vs the EU and the euro, not only in Greece. The alternative is striking a humane pose, accept that loans are going to take longer, make the Greeks feel as partners again, and get a huge PR boost for 'magnanimous' Europe.

Accepting support and then leaving the negotiating table is cutting it a bit short :-) It was the former government who accepted the support, basically 'at gunpoint', because the EU was afraid problems in the Greek banking system would cause banks to topple. In return, the 'troika' basically got the right to decide on all fiscal policies, and those decisions caused the resentment that got Syriza elected. And it was pretty clear from day one that these policies would cause exactly that resentment.

Of course I agree that people should lend responsibly, but forcing them out is not going to get us our money back, just a bunch of devalued paper. Keeping them in and try their own way might still not work, but at least it gives us an extra couple years without a flirting candidate for Russia.

I'm way too much of a dreamy idealist about this, but isn't the prime motivation behind the whole solidarity in Europe thing that 'if we help them now, they might just be willing to help us if we ever get in trouble'? 

I always loved the idea of a united Europe, but the past 5 years it seems more and more like that idea has been hijacked and abused. While we should be bullying newer members about human right, minimum wage, health benefits etc, we are cutting incomes and pensions across southern Europe, treating people like commodities and supporting banks who knew damn well that their clients would run into trouble as soon as interest rates rose (again, also the borrower's fault for taking the loan he would be unable to pay back).

I think that's basically a mantra. What do you think it means that it's not an ""optimal currency area"", and why do you think it isn't?

&gt;In 8 years prior to joining the euro, the Italian economy grew by an average of 1.4% per year. Since joining the euro, it has hardly grown at all.

The figures are as I quoted them. They do *not* say what you're claiming. Are you just ignoring Italy's recorded growth rates? Or are you including the crisis period in order to make the claim? Because the crisis is still there, euro or no euro. I'd agree that nearly every country affected by the crisis has had their overall growth slashed, but that applies whether you're Iceland, the UK, or Italy.

&gt;Eh? Euro barometer thinks that ""at the other end of the scale, Italy is by far the country where attitudes towards the euro have deteriorated the most, where there is a 9pp increase in the proportion of respondents who think having the euro is a bad thing for their country"". Are you just disregarding this?

I quoted the figures I was using, and the source. And, really, it's a bit rich you accusing me of ignoring figures, when you're making a claim for Italy which is completely contradicted by the figures.

It just seems like a really stupid move to get this referendum to me. It basically means no matter what the result for greece will be pretty bad (in my oppinion). Either you quit negotiations essentialy forcing a grexit if the no vote passes or leaving a big political vaccuum and no government left to negotiate with. 

Honestly I am not decided if it is best for greece to stay in euro or leave it. Both have their merits, but to me the behavior of the greek government just seems pretty unprofessional and to much based around ideology rather than actually finding soliutions for the problems, because you won't get a solution by doing this referendum. The only point I can see in this referendum is that Syriza is trying to get their power backed up by their people or saying that the government failed if the referendum fails. 

To me it looks like the european countries tried to negotitate all the time and accepted that nobody can get 100%, but it seems like Syriza is not willing to negotiate. I also don't see a good reason why the european states would want to force greece out of the euro because as you said it won't get us the our money back. I just feel like the greek government is throwing out the trust and is making this about power. 

As for Greece flirting with Russia, I don't think Greece is of big enough geopolitical relevance to really worry about that too much and russia doesn't have that much money anyways. 

I also like the idea of a unified europe but it just seems utopian to me. The interests of the countries are just way different. I also think it is right to bully newer members into accepting human rights and health benefits and the likes, but I think what you said about cutting peoples incomes this may be painful at times but when it is necessary to do so it is necessary. If your wages grow way faster than the GDP and the amount of new debts skyrockets that will backfire some time requiring to reasses incomes.

Also it is not like there are a lot of alternatives to supporting the banks. The risk if a bank crashes is just so high that it will cause a big economic downfall. Also you cannot do so much for the people if the income rises to a not sustainable level you will hit the ground at sometimes and the higher you fall from the more it hurts.

I also think it is right to have he finance ministers manage this because this is majorly an issue of money and those are the institutions that have the expertise in this field.

It can easily shatter itself if the negotiated deal isnt 'leftist' enough, and the deal would still have to pass parliament, and thus NEEDS a unified Syriza. The referendum is a tool to avoid this schism in the party. My personal opinion on the referendum is that it should have happened sooner, it would have given negotiators from both sides insight into what voters would support, and they could have continued on from there.

It was right to have the finance ministers negotiate up until now, but at this point it has become ideological territory whether to keep or kick Greece, that is why I feel the prime ministers should take over.

Optimum currency area is a theory which many economists subscribe to. It isn't just a mantra. If the eurozone were an optimum currency area, one interest rate would work for the entire eurozone and growth and recession of each area would be aligned. Perhaps your position is that the eurozone is an optimum currency area? Or perhaps it is that it doesn't matter.

&gt; The figures are as I quoted them. They do not say what you're claiming. Are you just ignoring Italy's recorded growth rates? Or are you including the crisis period in order to make the claim? Because the crisis is still there, euro or no euro. I'd agree that nearly every country affected by the crisis has had their overall growth slashed, but that applies whether you're Iceland, the UK, or Italy.

I'm looking at the entire time that Italy has spent in the euro. It doesn't make sense not to consider the crisis, because our judgment of the success of the euro must also consider how well a currency copes with a crisis. It is also the case that the crisis has lasted much longer, partly because of the euro. Is your position that when considering the impact of the euro on Italy we should only consider the boom years and not the crisis?

The UK did also have a heavy recession with the crisis, as did Iceland. However, with their own currencies they had more options available to them.

&gt;I quoted the figures I was using, and the source. And, really, it's a bit rich you accusing me of ignoring figures, when you're making a claim for Italy which is completely contradicted by the figures.

Yes, and I acknowledged your figures and source and noted that the question asked did not focus on the impact of the euro on Italy. I find it a bit surprising that you don't acknowldge my source.

Interestingly the final draft docs between the Syriza proposal and the 27 June proposal from EU doesn't look too dissimilar (both are available on FT.com).  I think Syriza should be open with what they have compromised with the EU if they have not done so already and highlight what they fundamental disagree with and why this all had to go into a referendum. 

The idea of a referendum isn't new I believe (the Germans suggested it also a while ago).  To deny it then and carry one out now is a political move from Syriza's part as well. There would have been a more amicble outcome with more of a plan if this all happened a month ago. There had been other 'take it or leave it' proposals (or styled that way) before with the previous IMF payment deadlines. Syriza in my opinion, is getting to the point that they have to make a choice that binds the Greek people, and they choose to defer the thinking to the populace. Instead of taking responsibility of their negotiations they are asking the Greeks to take responsibility of the outcome of their negotiations, and the consequence of their bad tactics (through bad planning and timing).

&gt;No, they all accept credit cards from all over the world, it's just that half of them only accept chip &amp; pin cards that are Italian. 

Actually shops will accept only cards belonging to an international circuit chosen by the shop owner - the storefront will always state clearly whether the shop accepts payments from Cirrus or V-Pay debit card holders, Visa or Mastercard credit card holders (just naming the most widespread circuits, other ones are also available on Italian soil). It is incorrect to say that only Italian cards will be accepted in some shops, as basically there is no such thing as “Italian banks” anymore (Barclays, ING Direct, Deutsche Bank, Paribas, Santander, UBS (1) all operate in Italy under their own name or by corporate ties to former Italian banks). 
Again, which cards get accepted, regardless of the country they were issued in or the type of card itself, only depends on the circuit they belong to - see above.

(1) again, just naming a few international banks/circuits off the top of my head (added for clarity!)

&gt;Other nationalities' credit cards (even if they have chip &amp; pin) only work with the magnetic strip in the old fashioned way.

That sadly only has to do with the “old age” of the POS, AKA the device where you swipe your card/insert your card into. As they are a) rented out to shops and b) not cheap in the slightest, a few shop owners don’t even bother getting the latest models as they are too expensive for them, so they rely on older equipment. That’s why shops who have just started their business are more likely to have POS devices that read both debit cards/chip-and-pin/contactless.

As per OP’s original request, as Google Wallet is not available in Italy and certain types of shops (ie. cafés) won’t be equipped with POS it is wise to have a little cash always available. Maybe a PayPal rechargeable card could be an alternative solution, I see they’re widely used by tourists and younger residents alike.

&gt; According to this definition, any variety of a language constitutes ""a dialect"", including any standard varieties. 

Even if there was a very isolated and exotic form of language and all of its speakers spoke exactly in the same way, it would still be correct to say the speakers share a common *dialect*. If there's just one dialect it's still a dialect.

&gt; [...] **There is no universally accepted criterion for distinguishing a language from a dialect. A number of rough measures exist, sometimes leading to contradictory results. The distinction is therefore subjective and depends on the user's frame of reference.**

Then you have the common usage of the word ""dialect"", which is very subjective, this is why people end up arguing whether such or such variety is ""a dialect or a language"" and often there is no objective answer.

&gt; The other usage refers to a language that is socially subordinated to a regional or national standard language, often historically cognate to the standard, but not derived from it. In this sense, the standard language is not itself considered a dialect.

And still from your Wikipedia link:

&gt; The terms ""language"" and ""dialect"" are not necessarily mutually exclusive: There is nothing contradictory in the statement ""the language of the Pennsylvania Dutch is a dialect of German"".

Then...

&gt; A language is a dialect with an army and navy.

I hate this last quote because Catalan and Spanish are typically considered different languages, but Mexican and Colombian are not. Australian and American are never considered different languages either. 

&gt; Linguists, however, do make a distinction between the two based on the concept of mutual intelligibility. Two languages where speakers can understand each other are considered dialects of the same language, whereas two languages where the speakers cannot understand each other are, indeed, separate languages.

I have frequently heard the opposite, because mutual intelligibility isn't necessarily symmetrical, because of continuums (geographically close dialects of Occitan are mutually intelligible, and Niçard is intelligible by an Italian speaker, but it's not like anyone can understand anyone in that group) and also because here again you have subjective choices: when did French and Italian start being different languages? Why would Napoletano be a dialect of ""Italian"" if Portuguese isn't a dialect of ""Spanish""? There is no linguistically objective reason.

null,false,cyend,EURO,European Union,null,"Well, passing any different measure than what was offered had a chance of not getting through the parliaments. A financial minister and the coalition would have to put themselves strongly behind any agreement reached and since it was only a temporary deal, lasting until the winter, vouching for something that might completely fail or be intentionally sabotaged by the Greek government would result in a very public political embarrassment. In addition to that, that would make it pretty much impossible to pass an actual, 100bil+ € new deal later in the year, which would mean that the billions spent on Greece until then would be a complete waste.

Tsipras' 8bn proposal supposedly included getting the majority of these savings from raising taxes, which was seen as a tongue-in-cheek offer. Firstly because Mr V and Tsipras were arguing against including the tax rises for ages, since they admitted they would not be able to collect them and if the tax avoidance increased, the total money collected might be less than what they were getting with smaller taxes. Because of that the published troika offer demanded a massive simplification of the tax system, via the removal of hundreds of loopholes and special exemptions that were lobbied for in the ""good times"". Additionally, it dropped some tax levels (for basic food items and tourist stuff like hotel services) while only slightly increasing VAT.

Secondly because troika became painfully aware of how inefficient the Greek government is at implementing  promised reforms from 2012 and they knew that the only deal that can actually work is one that is going to be implemented, not necessarily one that might look the best on paper. Because of this reason, Greece was still negotiating about some very basic budget balancing conditions, that were passed by plenty EU countries on their own when the crisis struck. Even in 2015, they still don't have a functioning tax-evasion/corruption fighting institution, even though it would almost surely be highly profitable for the state and has been promised to the creditors a million times. Trust has definitely been a problem throughout this whole crisis. After all the low public punches the Greeks have lounged towards the creditor states, I feel like it would not be below Tsipras to get his own proposal passed, take the money and then publicly blast troika for horrible measures and ""fight"" to delay them to protect the dignity of the Greeks or something.

Thirdly, 75% of the Greek budget go towards salaries for public employees and pensions, which is unsustainably high if you want to run a functioning state. You can see pretty quickly that regardless of what you do to the 25% (which has been heavily haircut already), not doing a thorough reform of the remaining 75% and just keeping it fed by increasing taxes while the tax base is dropping like a stone, will only move the date of the inevitable budget collapse a bit further  to the future. And you also can't just keep funding it with new loans either, since it will have the exactly same effect. On another hand, you can't really do any heavy handed pension or salary reductions. This is a very bad situation and I'm not sure it is realistically solvable in any way except what the creditors suggested, which is long-term reforms affected early retirement and similar, while keeping Greece funded. Another solution would be a massive kickstart of the Greek economy and an insane boom in GDP, which would bring more income to the budget. I'm pretty sure that the latter option was Syriza's plan, but I don't really see them offering any concrete ideas on how to do it.",null,0,null,1435624785,null,0,false,0,csn0oo9,null,t3_3bjkgr,null,t1_csn0oo9,null,t1_csmyhki,null,null,null,1437451363,null,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6,null

null,false,Theban_Prince,EURO,European Union,null,"&gt; Well, passing any different measure than what was offered had a chance of not getting through the parliaments. A financial minister and the coalition would have to put themselves strongly behind any agreement reached and since it was only a temporary deal, lasting until the winter, vouching for something that might completely fail or be intentionally sabotaged by the Greek government would result in a very public political embarrassment. In addition to that, that would make it pretty much impossible to pass an actual, 100bil+ € new deal later in the year, which would mean that the billions spent on Greece until then would be a complete waste.

I am referring a permanent deal as Greece asked, not the 5 months extension Europe themselves offered.

&gt;Tsipras' 8bn proposal supposedly included getting the majority of these savings from raising taxes, which was seen as a tongue-in-cheek offer. Firstly because Mr V and Tsipras were arguing against including the tax rises for ages, since they admitted they would not be able to collect them and if the tax avoidance increased, the total money collected might be less than what they were getting with smaller taxes. Because of that the published troika offer demanded a massive simplification of the tax system, via the removal of hundreds of loopholes and special exemptions that were lobbied for in the ""good times"". Additionally, it dropped some tax levels (for basic food items and tourist stuff like hotel services) while only slightly increasing VAT.

Tsipras have been painted as a hardcore that will never back down. This *was* a back down, even if not in the extend EU wanted. There where talks in Greece of the Goverment disintegrating because he ""capitulated"" according to a large part of its party. And then EU send an ultimatum..

&gt;Secondly because troika became painfully aware of how inefficient the Greek government is at implementing promised reforms from 2012 and they knew that the only deal that can actually work is one that is going to be implemented, not necessarily one that might look the best on paper. Because of this reason, Greece was still negotiating about some very basic budget balancing conditions, that were passed by plenty EU countries on their own when the crisis struck. Even in 2015, they still don't have a functioning tax-evasion/corruption fighting institution, even though it would almost surely be highly profitable for the state and has been promised to the creditors a million times. Trust has definitely been a problem throughout this whole crisis. After all the low public punches the Greeks have lounged towards the creditor states, I feel like it would not be below Tsipras to get his own proposal passed, take the money and then publicly blast troika for horrible measures and ""fight"" to delay them to protect the dignity of the Greeks or something.

If there was even a slim chance this measures getting implemented, Tsipras government was the only one. The previous governments who dealed with the EU were the same people that caused the whole lot of corruption for 23 years. Tsipras government is the only with brand new people not entrenched (yet) into the corruption system. If this was their point, they shot themselves in the foot.

&gt;Thirdly, 75% of the Greek budget go towards salaries for public employees and pensions, which is unsustainably high if you want to run a functioning state. You can see pretty quickly that regardless of what you do to the 25% (which has been heavily haircut already), not doing a thorough reform of the remaining 75% and just keeping it fed by increasing taxes while the tax base is dropping like a stone, will only move the date of the inevitable budget collapse a bit further to the future. And you also can't just keep funding it with new loans either, since it will have the exactly same effect. On another hand, you can't really do any heavy handed pension or salary reductions. This is a very bad situation and I'm not sure it is realistically solvable in any way except what the creditors suggested, which is long-term reforms affected early retirement and similar, while keeping Greece funded. Another solution would be a massive kickstart of the Greek economy and an insane boom in GDP, which would bring more income to the budget. I'm pretty sure that the latter option was Syriza's plan, but I don't really see them offering any concrete ideas on how to do it.

I agree with your assertion, however the EU moved for cuts in social spending too fast without any plans (and funding) for absorbing the shock, and when the economy is entirely structured around this , it will cause it to dry up very fast. This is the reason of the plummeting GDP the last 5 years, that the shock austerity measures shot a *sick* economy *dead*. And then these last days the EU asked for further reductions in pensions (hitting the economy for a projected 7-11% loss) and more worryingly called for a cut in the early retirement. This would have devastating social repercussions, since a lot of older people that lose their jobs due to the crisis have only the option of early retirement (which is not full pension by the way, and has certain limits) or , well, die I guess?.",null,0,null,1435626032,null,0,false,0,csn1dtn,null,t3_3bjkgr,null,t1_csn1dtn,null,t1_csn0oo9,null,null,null,1437451930,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

&gt;A reluctance to pay taxes was much criticised by Greece’s creditors as one reason why the country needed a big international bailout. Now many Greeks are again avoiding the taxman as they bet the radical left Syriza party will quickly loosen fiscal policy if it comes to power in Sunday’s general election.

&gt;However, two private sector economists forecast the shortfall could exceed €1.5bn, or more than 40 per cent of projected revenues for January.

&gt;Angeliki Mousouri, a dentist who is paying off more than €20,000 of tax arrears, said she missed a monthly instalment due in December.

&gt;“I don’t expect to be penalised,” she said. “If Syriza is the government they will show leniency to cash-strapped taxpayers.”

How about the [economist](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21643195-can-greeces-new-government-satisfy-voters-and-compromise-its) on February 14th 2015? 

&gt;ALEXIS TSIPRAS and his radical left Syriza party worked for more than a year while in opposition to prepare their policy platform. Over 80 committees were charged with producing specific proposals for overhauling different sectors of the Greek economy. Planning for power is one thing; exercising it quite another, especially when a country is in a hole as deep as Greece’s.

&gt;Syriza’s programme, if fully implemented, will result in a sharp fall in revenues and a large increase in social spending. Yet many Greeks stopped paying taxes before last month’s elections, anticipating cuts and forbearance. Government revenues fell by more than 20% in January on an annual basis; the 2015 budget is now likely to be derailed by the end of March, says a former finance minister.

Current data.

Edit:

I am going to absolutely not trust those numbers in the wiki link because the heritage foundation I'm guessing is using government published data. I can't tell as they don't show their methodology. Why? Because the Greek government is absolutely untrustworthy. Why do I say this? Well read [this](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/12/16/143766906/a-technocrat-in-trouble)

&gt;Andreas Georgiou is the technocrat charged with running the Greek statistics office — the same office that, in the years leading up to the financial crisis, produced wildly distorted reports of Greece's finances.

&gt;""My goal is to make this a competent, boring institution and not to be in the limelight,"" Georgiou told me recently. ""Not to have to give an interview like this one.""

Or how about the [FT](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5776ca06-47bb-11e4-ac9f-00144feab7de.html#axzz3eVGbcNW8)

&gt;So far, though, his efforts have been met with resistance, strikes and a criminal investigation that could lead to life in prison for Georgiou.

And what about the [International Statistics Institute](http://www.isi-web.org/images/news/20130304ISIGreece-Statement.pdf)?

&gt;The undersigned ISI representatives are making this statement to express their profound disappointment and serious concern over the prosecution of Mr Andreas Georgiou, President of the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) and two of his ELSTAT Managers. The charges against Mr Georgiou and two of his Managers of exaggerating the estimates of Greek government deficit and debt for the year 2009 are fanciful and not consistent with the facts.

And as far as I can tell, the criminal case is *STILL* ongoing... So... If this statistician is saying X and the Greek government is threatening him with jail.

Yes and no.  That map also describes the regional variety of Standard Italian.  Another thing to keep in mind is that in everyday speech, people can code switch between Standard Italian, regionally-accented Standard Italian and their local language. 

I was recently at a coffee shop and I swear to Christ they were talking in Catalan at certain points.  It was a Venetian and a Milanese.  They told me that when they speak, they can fine-tune the frequency and volume regionalisms depending on the context of the conversation.

Neither of those. The reason I say it's a mantra is not because there isn't a theory, but because people who use the term appear to treat an optimum currency area as if it were some kind of natural object. The theory's author, looking specifically at the euro, reckoned it was possible for a non-optimum area to become one through convergence. So my view is basically that the eurozone wasn't (and isn't) an optimum currency area, but that the intention is that it become one.

It's not very different from someone saying ""this is not an optimum marriage because one partner earns more"", and that the only solutions are divorce or forced equalisation of earnings. Sometimes you have to work for things, because some things take work.

&gt;Is your position that when considering the impact of the euro on Italy we should only consider the boom years and not the crisis? 

When looking at whether the euro has been good for Italy, yes. It's not possible to disentangle the effects of the global crisis out from the effects of the euro, which means that including the crisis is rather like deciding that someone's lifestyle was unhealthy because they were run over by a truck at 40. After all, they're dead, which is hardly healthy, so we should clearly include their early death in the analysis.

&gt;Yes, and I acknowledged your figures and source and noted that the question asked did not focus on the impact of the euro on Italy. I find it a bit surprising that you don't acknowldge my source.

Hmm. See, what you said was that Italians were ""turning massively against the euro"". To me, the way one judges that is whether they favour continued euro membership, rather than whether they feel the euro has had a bad impact. But I guess one could say that that's *my* interpretation of what what you said meant, and *your* interpretation of that is likely to be more relevant! So you feel that your source substantiates your view of ""massively turning against"", while I feel that mine substantiates my view of ""continue majority supporting"", and I think we're both basically justified.",null,0,null,1435628813,null,0,1435629085,0,csn2x9l,null,t3_3bhzo6,null,t1_csn2x9l,null,t1_csmzh4s,null,null,null,1437453103,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

It was Europe that had to propose cutting spending on Greece's defence budget and to increase taxes on shipping companies (foreign shipping companies often pay almost no tax in Greece),...

&gt;it is really kind of more of an accounting method than anything else even though they don't quite seem to get that.

It's the difference between putting the load directly on the individual and broader society. I believe broader society benefits from an educated populous, both financially and otherwise. And the successful student will pay back their education in higher taxes anyway. The effect of this would be improved in the system I proposed (re: history of art etc). 

**The US system says all the risk and cost is on you, and if you're successful then we'll all share the benefit from your work and investment.** There is no fairness in that.. or logic or consistency.

&gt;the vast majority of people graduate with relatively little debt

Bull. shit. *Average* debt is almost [$30,000](http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/10/pf/college/student-loans/) and [rising fast](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/class-of-2015-has-the-most-student-debt-in-us-history-2015-05-08#article-body). Law school is [$75k/$125K](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/average_debt_load_of_private_law_grads_is_125k_these_five_schools_lead_to_m/) for public/private schools respectively. Being in tens of thousands of debt is an absolutely horrible way to start out your working life, and quite repressive.

&gt;should have at least been able to narrow down what you want to do with your life by the time you are at the tertiary level

'should'. More theory instead of reality. It's not borne out by my experience, not to mention those who *think* they know but figure out they were wrong. People at 18 don't know shit, they lack the life experience to help inform their decision. Imperfect knowledge =&gt; market failure.

&gt;Your perspective is rather selfish

What the actual fuck. It is literally the opposite. I am willing to pay toward the education of others, willing to recognise that people are human, they are not perfect and can make mistakes, and not punish them heavily for that. Meanwhile your position could fairly be summarised as ""fuck you sort your own shit out"" and MY position is selfish! wow.  
Again, dealing with reality instead of how you think the world *should* be. If somebody has to drop out because they've been injured or fallen ill, or have to look after a family member, or suffer a personal tragedy, or develop depression or have a stress breakdown, or countless other shit that can go wrong in real life, then they should suffer on top the burden of debt, because you didn't have anything terrible happen to you it literally can't happen and everyone in debt is that way because they are irresponsible or foolish. MY position is selfish.

When you talk of ""free"" education-- yes, everyone knows it has to be paid for, just like primary and secondary education (no logical distinction why one should be free at the point of use and not the other), or the fire service.. but let's ignore those things because all socialised programs are evil-- it should be remembered that this education is not without cost to the student. Not only are there lost earnings during study, but living costs have to be paid for, and years of their life are dedicated to it. These are all factors which work against the idea that someone might be flippant with their decision. That does not guarantee the decision is always right. The rich of course can afford to be flippant, but that doesn't change with a personally funded system, it's just a slightly smaller set.

Sadly, this seems likely to be a big waste of time, as you don't appear to hold an open mind on the issue. I've come to suspect you hold libertarian (as in the an-cap leaning variety) views, which most followers treat more like a religion. At least own the fact that this is a philosophy that is selfish to its core. Such a person would prefer to be certain that nobody unfairly benefited, even if the ""free"" system gave better outcomes in aggregate (where there is a greater increase in GDP and additional tax receipts over paying for the cost of the education).

The great tragedy is that the pensions were up until now *largely* financed through debt to private institutions; not even the Eurozone.

So now, their non-working population (I know, I know, everyone should be full steam ahead until 65) can barely subsist, and the thing which generated its temporary standard of existence is exactly that which is crushing the nation.

Of course, this is just the latest assistance package - previous ones went to servicing other debts to ECB members (nations which gave financial assistance from 2010 on), and again - - pensions and government operations.

Basically, none of the money Greek's government has spent since it joined the Eurozone has gone towards:

1) significant infrastructure improvements

2) investments in education that fits the need of capital (like teaching kids in public schools to code or incentivizing engineering students)

3) subsidizing Greek innovation in the private sector, or helping it develop by allowing risk taking to be feasible

Bremmer thinking it was a good idea to take the entire officer and political corps of the Saddam regime and put them out of a job in a country with lots of weapons caches and Wahhabist ideology was a bad idea.

No one disputes that.

What I dispute is the notion that the US has a moral responsibility for savages - - savage Sunnis, and savage Shiites - - deciding that the best way to honor their god and their prophet is to start butchering each other to rack up as many dead men, women, and children as they can manage.

If you think a ""No"" will give Greece a better deal, you're delusional. And many will then blame the EZ and call them ""undemocratic"" and ""not accepting the will of the Greek people"" if ""No"" wins and the creditors do not offer a better deal (as they have said multiple times they won't).

I don't mind the referendum itself - I think it's a great idea (though should probably have been scheduled a few days earlier, so that there would still be time to pay the IMF). It's just sad to see it being spun as ""Yes to current deal"", or ""No, a better deal"", when it's obvious that's not what it's going to be (and everyone but the Greek government agree). A fair, neutral referendum should be a ""Yes to current deal (austerity)"" or ""No, we default (new drachma, devaluation)"" question, *that* would be democratic for both Greece and the creditor nations, as the Greek people would know exactly what they were voting for, instead of being mislead into delusions that the creditors would be bound into giving them much better conditions if ""No"" wins.",null,0,null,1435632087,null,0,1435633265,0,csn4q03,null,t3_3bi6wc,null,t1_csn4q03,null,t1_csmsw90,null,null,null,1437454470,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Greece and the EU have painted themselves collectively into a corner.

A member state can apply for ending its EU membership, but again, that would require Greece taking active steps. Given the roughly four billion Euros Greece receives every year in EU subsidies (for regional development, agriculture etc.), I doubt they would want to do that.

4 years ago (when I was 19), we went for a family vacation to Tunisia. I bought a [lighter that looked like something from Pirates of the Carribean](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/pirates/images/b/b7/Jack_pistol.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101009051003). Nothing even remotely similar to a real modern weapon.

The day to go home comes and we are at the airport. Suddenly I hear my name in broken english from terminal. I go and ask what's up. There were about 5 security guards checking out my luggage for a suspicious item. I reach in and show them it's just a gun. As I pull it out, all of the security guards step back and reach for their revolver. I am like ""chill, it's just a lighter"" and decide to show them. But there's not enough fluid and so just some sparks fly out almost as if I'm arming the device to shoot. One of the guards pulls out the revolver and yells to put the gun down.

After a talk they realise it's just harmless lighter, but they still won't let me take it over the boarder. Their reasoning is probably the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard and I swear I didn't make this up:

They can't let it through because what if it gets stolen by KGB (yes, he said KGB specifically), remade somehow into a real weapon and used to kill someone, they would trace this gun right back to Tunisia and so it would be known in the world Tunisia sells weapons to KGB.

null,false,wcctnoam,GALI,Galicia,null,"If you're interested, here are some corrections (I won't say anything about 'ñ' and diacritics, that's probably because of your keyboard):

'He aprendido **a** hablar Español' or 'He aprendido Español' would be better. Yours is mostly fine but sounds a bit broken.

'necesito' only has one s. In fact, I can't think of any word in Spanish that has double s, so don't worry about that. (I hope noone shows up to show me 20 examples -.-)

'decadas' is feminine, but don't sweat it. Coming from a language such as English, take all the time you need to get the hang on word's gender.

For 'no mas sera un país Anglo/blanco en verdad'. Things could always be phrased differently, but without changing your sentence and structure completely, dropping both 'mas' and 'en verdad' conveys the same meaning and sounds more natural.

For the next sentence, minor corrections: 'hispana' (because the subject 'la población' is feminine, so it must be for the adjective), and 'sera' is the wrong choice of verb. 'To be' can either be 'Ser' or 'Haber' depending on the meaning, and here it's the second one (with the conjugation 'habrá')

Next up is a perfect sentence, nothing important to add.

Third paragraph: 'por la cual hay **una gran mezcla**' ('mezclado' is adjective, 'mezcla' is the noun you're looking for, and it's feminine), 'la forma **de los** mestizos de México' ('del' is contraction of 'de el'. You already have the correct article, 'los').
'quienes estan mucho mas grande de la poblacion de los anglos y holandes' is quite a mess. Assuming your original sentence was something like ""who are much bigger in population than anglos and dutch"", the least amount of change I can offer to make it a proper sentence is 'los cuales tienen mucha mas población que los anglos y holandeses'. 'quienes' has a bit of uncertainty to it, but here you're clearly referring to something so 'los cuales' is the proper choice. 'estan' comes from 'ser', but places 'tienen' ('have') population. 'mucho mas' and 'mas grande' convey the same meaning, 'more', so you only need one of them. 'de la' before 'población' is not need, but I can't go into detail as to why. I just know it's wrong.
Finally for this paragraph, '**los** EEUU' (for all purposes, EEUU is the same thing as 'Estados Unidos', so since the original term is masculine, so it is for the abreviation), and 'por hispanohablantes'. Wether that one is correct or not depends on the original meaning: 'for hispanics' would be 'para hispanos', while 'by hispanics' would be 'por hispanos'.

Onwards: 'Yo se **que** mi español' ('I know **that** my Spanish', you can skip it in English but you need it in Spanish), 'para un nativo **aceptar**' (only one 'c' here. This time, however, there are definitely words with 'cc', but the digraph conveys a different sound. Think of words like 'accept' or 'action' in English: when you pronounce it, there's a little pause on the first part. If you force it, it would sound like 'Ak-cept' or 'Ak-tion', that's the kind of sound/pause 'cc' conveys in Spanish. 'Aceptar' doesn't have it, while 'Acción' does, so it's all about pronunciation). 'porque no tengo **acentos**' (same thing, no pause in Spanish), 'errores **en** concordancia' (probably a typo), 'la **ortografía**' (In Spanish, the only reason for a word to have 'ph' is because it's an artificial, probably scientific, word directly made from greek roots. A 'ph' sound is almost always an 'f'), 'estoy **intentandolo**!' ('Tratar' can sometimes be used for this but its definition is much closer to 'To Treat' or 'To process'. 'Intentar' means 'To Try' and you can never go wrong in that regard.)

And *finally* finally: 'que lleguen **ilegalmente**' ('illegally'. The other way might work too in hispanic dialects, but since I'm not sure I would rather correct it like this since it should be fine worldwide) and '**traten de aprender**' (Conjugated to subjunctive present because it's an action you wish for but hasn't happened yet, third form plural because of the subject 'los hispanos', 'de' is needed because it changes the meaning of 'tratar', kind of like a phrasal verb [you can substitute 'traten de' por 'intenten'], and 'aprender' only has one 'p', and in this case I'm as confident that no Spanish word has 'pp' was I was about 'ss').

I assume that if the concern was the existing debt, that would have happened by now.  After all, if Greece is going to not pay in Europe, it can also not pay outside of Europe.

However, I've heard other concerns listed:

* The political fallout of Greece having an anti-austerity party come in and shut down reform requirements may be unacceptable due to what it would do to the rest of the EZ.

* As more money is sent to Greece, it might keep being burned.  That means ongoing losses If this is at a rate that the EZ accepts and wants to have happen, that's fine...but then I think that other things would also need to happen.  If Greece wants a subsidized standard of living, then other members would surely also want subsidies.

* I understand that part of the goal of the EZ was to accept stable members.  While Greece was (secretly) not within acceptable parameters, I wonder if perhaps the scope of this was beyond what the people making the original call had expected and that the revised estimate is that other EZ members are, on the net, better off without Greece, even taking into account all the other factors.

* If this were to be done, it seems to me that it would have made more sense to do this six months ago rather than now.  To do it now would be to accept the economic harm from the banks in trouble, the political harm from sitting on the brink and having unpleasant politics show up, and so forth...and it doesn't seem like it would buy anything.",null,0,null,1435638235,null,0,false,0,csn7shq,null,t3_3bjv2l,null,t1_csn7shq,null,t3_3bjv2l,null,null,null,1437530704,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

&gt;'necesito' only has one s.

Yup, always fuck that one up.


&gt;'quienes' has a bit of uncertainty to it, but here you're clearly referring to something so 'los cuales' is the proper choice

Yep, my bad.

&gt;Onwards: 'Yo se que mi español' ('I know that my Spanish', you can skip it in English but you need it in Spanish)

I can hear my professor tutting about clausulas. 

**Thank you** for all the pointers. 

I'm really hoping to get it within a year or two beyond just functional proficiency (Spain origin - - well, she was from Barcelona, I dunno if that makes a difference to you - -  and Latin American origin speakers have confirmed beyond friendly politeness that I can function and hold 'normal' conversations, despite it being painfully obvious I'm not a native, and that they have to overlook mistakes), and really be able to speak your language without flaws.

I value so highly my own ability to speak and write clearly in English - but that's just a product of being a native speaker; it would be a shame if I were never able to do the same in another language.

I don't understand this.

If you have a trade imbalance, at some point, I'm going to have to give up something that I value more-and-more to get whatever I want from you.  At that point, I'm not going to buy your thing.

Across currencies, okay, we agree -- the currency adjusts in value.  That's *one* mechanism by which this process can happen.  Maybe it has benefits, because it's not all that internally-disruptive.  Everyone can stay in their jobs -- it's just that their savings are worth less in real terms and their job pays them less in real terms.

But if I have a common currency, I don't see any reason why the same adjustment in wages cannot happen.  It will perhaps be disruptive, in that people will be laid off, maybe businesses will go out of business, and new businesses will have to be created hiring people at a lower rate -- the system of prices and budgeting in place internally will create more of a shock.

It can, but what sort of adjustment in wages are we talking about that will suddenly have Greece producing sizeable output at competitive levels to the Northern consumer? 

What happens then to the Northern worker whose business has lost a sizeable mkt share at home because of Greece imports and in Greece because of lower wages there?

So you are right! It's not like the economies can't adjust, it's that everyone is better off if they don't in a recessionary way.

Even if you agree with that premise isn't that the responsibility of those states? I don't really see that as a negative. On the topic of immigration caps the 10s of thousands figure is laughable, that would require ridiculously large cuts to immigration from EU &amp; outside. Even if we left the EU they would still need to cut immigration ([net migration ignoring EU is ~150k](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/may-2015/stb-msqr-may-2015.html#tab-3--Emigration-from-the-UK)). But again, this isn't a positive unless you inherently favour non EU migrants, which I don't (quite the contrary actually). At least while in the EU they can't mercilessly cut the immigration numbers for political reasons. 

Then we come to TTIP, the deal that no one has even read yet so can't even comment on properly. Again, not a negative, *yet*. 

The CAP issue I can understand but still I believe food security is important &amp; keeping our agriculture business alive is inherently a national security issue imo. Especially considering future changes due to climate change will decimate agriculture in many parts of Africa &amp; Europe, relying on production outside our borders is quite a dangerous route to go down. 

From a leftie perspective coming from the UK I see the EU as protecting certain rights I don't trust my own government to uphold (employment rights e.g. WTD, [environmental issues](http://www.foe.co.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/eu_referendum_environment.pdf)). I don't really see [my government](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rGX91rq5I) as that democratic &amp; I don't trust them at all to represent my views at the moment. I also feel other EU countries are more left wing than the UK &amp; that is represented in the EU parliament makeup &amp; the kind of legislation the commission proposes. I do admit this is kind of an ironic opinion considering how undemocratic the EU is currently (in terms of turnout, not the process). Hopefully in the future people will get involved more in EU elections &amp; we'll see less parties like [UKIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_European_Parliament_for_the_United_Kingdom,_2014%E2%80%9319) (Greens/Liberals should be getting way more MEPs, people aren't going out to vote!) getting so many seats here!",null,0,null,1435640267,null,0,1435641216,0,csn8orx,null,t3_3bkscm,null,t1_csn8orx,null,t3_3bkscm,null,null,null,1437531126,null,18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,18,null

It's just that there have been a lot of people, like Mr. Krugman, saying what could be read as ""without different currencies or some intergovernmental system of transfers, you cannot maintain a balance of trade"".  And that, at least to me (not a professional economist, mind) did not sound correct; at best a misleading oversimplification.  It might be more disruptive to economies to take this route, and in particular, dealing with volatile differences in what each can produce would be an issue -- for example, if year-by-year Greece's GDP relative to that of its primary trade partners wildly swings, that would be terribly problematic, no doubt.

But if the issue is simply a straightforward ""Germany produces things N% more-efficiently than Greece"", I'd think that that would be the most-viable case for the ""disruptive"" approach to the trade equilibrium being maintained that I described above.

&gt;The largest wave of immigration in history from a single country to the United States has come to a standstill. After four decades that brought 12 million current immigrants—most of whom came illegally—the net migration flow from Mexico to the United States has stopped and may have reversed, according to a new analysis of government data from both countries by the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research Center...It is possible that the Mexican immigration wave will resume as the U.S. economy recovers. Even if it doesn’t, it has already secured a place in the record books. The U.S. today has more immigrants from Mexico alone—12.0 million—than any other country in the world has from all countries of the world.1 Some 30% of all current U.S. immigrants were born in Mexico. The next largest sending country—China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan)—accounts for just 5% of the nation’s current stock of about 40 million immigrants.

Another interesting statistic -- I was reading about gang violence a while back and was absolutely bowled over by the statistic that about one-third of El Salvador'S population was in the US.

&gt;Well, if you have actually read [the treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Guarantee_(1960\)), you'd knew that **they were** ***explicitly*** **within their rights to invade**. Now, **the occupation starting with the second campaign** ***is*** **a violation of the treaty**, but that still doesn't mean they had no right to invade in the first place.




Exactly. It is so frustrating to hear many of my fellow Greeks argue falsehood and discredit themselves by not acknowledging simple facts. 




The (first) Turkish invasion (let's call it **""Attila 1""** or **A1**), was triggered by the attempted coup (**B**) against the legitimate Cypriot government (**C**) and perpetrated by nationalist Greek-Cypriots (**D**) that were backed by the illegitimate Ioannidis military junta government of Greece (**E**) at the time. 




So, **E** helped **D** to overthrow **C**, a government elected by all the people of Cyprus and comprised by both Greek-Cypriots *and* Turkish-Cypriots, through illegitimate ways (**B**) and this gave a valid reason for **A1** to happen.




**BUT**, unfortunately, Turkey was not satisfied by the restoration of the democratically elected government of Cyprus. They had their own agenda, an agenda as dubious as that of the Greek military junta. 




Whereas **""Attila 1""** (**A1**) happened justifiably, with little loss of life, and resulted in occupying merely 3% of the island, **""Attila 2""** (or **A2**, that happened several weeks later) was totally unprovoked, cost the lives of thousands of people and resulted in the occupation of roughly 40% of the entire island. 




The junta in Greece had already fallen immediately after **A1**, hostilities within Cyprus had ceased and those who attempted the coup were arrested, and talks were underway; when Turkey invaded the rest of the area (**A2**), it was totally unexpected and unlawful. Those two events are separate and should not be lumped together.",null,0,null,1435641360,null,0,false,0,csn951w,null,t3_3bhu5u,null,t1_csn951w,null,t1_csmfi9m,null,null,null,1437456068,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

For a dev with 3-5 years experience, you are looking at around 25-27k a year (before tax) in cities like Madrid-Barcelona. Lower if you go to Málaga, Granada, Sevilla, Valencia, etc.
For someone with no experience, you are lucky if you land a job that pays more than 12-15k.

If you are really good and land a job at a good company, you can go over 30k, but it's not really common.

People start burning through their savings and are eventually left with literally nothing.

It **doesn't matter** how wealthy they are when a big drop like that happens, because they can't actually use that wealth to stabilize on their own. Even the wealthiest country is going to the gutter unless bailed out timely and decisively.

Contrast this with a smaller, poorer country, but one with a stable or growing economy. There's a lot more job security, wage security, banks are going nowhere, and the economy can function normally. Romania is in a far, far better position than Greece, and it would not be unfair at all to suggest that you, as an EU member, should participate in rescuing them.

Ugh.

&gt; it has agreed to carry through most of the privatizations imposed under the agreement reached with the previous conservative New Democracy government

Athens will continue to uphold agreements made previous to the current government.

&gt;  it has agreed to increased taxation in various areas

Need to pay government spending and debt somehow.

&gt; it is willing to introduce “labor reforms”

It *needs* to introduce labour reforms, with or without the Troika. Also, it hasn't already, so still dragging feet.

&gt; it has postponed the implementation of a higher minimum wage and the re-employment of thousands of sacked staff

It has abandoned its plan to do something Athens couldn't realistically pay for.

These were all rather obviously vacuous promises for the electorate. They're not making great compromises for demanding the world and settling for only the northern hemisphere. To me, this reeks almost decadent greed.

Meanwhile:

&gt; The troika has agreed that the original targets for a budget surplus (before interest payments on debt) could be reduced from 3–4 percent of GDP a year up to 2020 to 1 percent this year, rising to 2 percent next year, etc. 

Major concession from the people who are due money, since again this is effectively giving Greece free money.

&gt; But this is no real concession because government tax revenues have collapsed during the negotiation period.

Also, a lot of public sectors were auctioned to private detainers and to my knowledge, bought by foreign companies.

Allow me to tell you how the pension system works down here. You get minimum wage until you get married and have kids, then you get a raise depending on your education (this is pretty much regardless of where you work) then when you get older and closer to pension age your salary gets pumped up heavily because your pension is determined by the last (correct me if Im wrong here) 3 or 5 years average monthly wage.

You'd freeze the country out: cutting off its financial institutions, trade sanctions, confiscation of assets of said country in other countries.

Greece is extremely import-dependent for anything high-tech, consumer electronics, machinery. Once Europe implements a sanctions regime like against Iran or Cuba, Greece would drop to third world status. Cut off all military parts trade and a year or two down the road the Hellenic air force would not fly much longer, the tanks would break and the submarines would stay in port.

The insecurity this would create would destroy the tourism industry in weeks. That's another 20% of GDP wiped out and a huge increase in unemployed.

null,false,skillphiliac,null,null,null,"&gt; Es hat ja auch gar nichts mit Linguistik zu tun. Linguistik untersucht was Sprache ist und wie sie funktioniert. Gendern ist ein Konzept das addressiert, wie die Sprache sein sollte. Ersteres ist deskriptiv, letzteres ist präskriptiv. Ersteres ist Wissenschaft, letzteres ist moralische Einstellung. Da musst du gar keine Kampfbegriffe wie ""Pseudowissenschaft"" rumwerfen.

Ach komm, was ein Quatsch. Das ist gerade der Punkt, dass Gendering ein zentraler Begriff in relativ jungen Teildisziplinen wie der feministischen Sprachwissenschaft ist. Interessant, dass du selber darauf eingehst, ein mehr oder minder allgemein verstandenes Paradigma der Linguistik ist, nicht wahllos mit der Präskriptivismuskeule herumzuschwingen.

Kleiner Crashkurs für alle, die's interessiert: Viele Sprachwissenschaftler echauffieren sich gerne über Leute oder auch Gremien, die einen gewissen Sprachgebrauch vorschreiben. Das heißt nicht, dass der Duden angefochten wird, stilistische Empfehlungen sind nämlich genau das - Empfehlungen. Es geht um Organisationen, die einen gewissen Sprachgebrauch vorschreiben möchten, vergleiche auch *Verein Deutsche Sprache* oder (gewissermaßen) *Bastian Sick*.

Gendering als solches basiert praktisch auf der Annahme, dass Sprache in ihrer momentanen Form als suboptimal zu verstehen und letztlich zu modifizieren ist. Warum? Du sagst, Gendering ist moralische Einstellung, ein Konzept das addressiert, wie Sprache sein soll.

Tut mir wahrlich Leid, aber das ist fast schon die Definition von Pseudowissenschaft. Sprachgebrauch ausserhalb des beruflichen Settings vorzuschreiben ist das Paradebeispiel für akademische Ignoranz und genau der Grund, warum sich so viele Leute darüber aufregen: es ist komplett fehl am Ort.

Worte sind inherent unbelastet. Wenn eine Dame pikiert ist, weil ich sie im Kollektiv als 'Studenten' angesprochen habe, dann ist das ihrer Wahrnehmung, ihren Erfahrungen zuzuschreiben. Das ist ein unglaublich individueller Kontext, jeder kann durch bestimmte Worte ""getriggert"" werden (du hast es so gewollt). Aber nur weil ich vehement gegen den Gebrauch von für mich unästhetisch anmuten lassenden Phrasen bin, habe ich noch lange kein Recht darauf, Vorschriften zu erlassen oder gar - noch schlimmer - Verbote. Das grenzt an Begrifflichkeiten wie Sprachhygiene und sollte wirklich nicht als Möglichkeit gelehrt werden.

Wenn Gendering von genug Leuten praktiziert wird und nicht plötzlich untergeht, dann wird es auch neben anderen, momentan gültigen Formulierungen Bestand haben. So funktioniert Sprache nunmal.

Zum Rest: ich hab relativ unbestimmt diejenigen Leute kritisiert, die sich nicht auf eine wissenschaftliche Baseline herunterbegeben wollen, um das Problem zu bereden. Kann mich nicht erinnern, explizit eine Person angegriffen zu haben. Du hingegen hast praktisch keinen Beitrag geleistet, anderen Teilnehmern hier einen kleinen Einblick zu gewähren, und zerpflückst stattdessen meine milden Spötteleien. Wie dir beliebt, ich hatte mich auf ein wenig mehr Substanz eingestellt und bin doch eher enttäuscht.

Second, this so called protection is practically non existent except in indefinite contracts, which are scarce nowadays, and in the last years this protection has been reduced. One of the good things of these worker protection laws is that you can't have an employee always on a ~~permanent~~ temporary basis: either you have hired someone for a specific period of time (flexible, in any case) or specific work and then let him go, or you hire him indefinitely because he is an asset to the business.

I wish common people would stop shooting themselves in the foot spreading this FUD that worker right protection laws make it harder to get employed. What makes it harder to get employed is a slowed down economy and the lack of a productive network (in the case of Spain), notwithstanding the stupidity of a good part of the employers (google news about the CEOE in Spain). The solution to that is definitely not to reduce workers rights.

You can't send people back to Syria or other countries in war.

The problem is not refugees who get to stay, as the amount that gets to stay was 24.000 in 2014 and that was a record year. The problem is illegals, which illegally move around in Europe and because they have no source of income, they have to do illegal things to survive.

Another problem is that it takes too long to process people (for various reasons). While more come, the number being processed keeps on increasing. It went from 350.000 in January 2014 to 500.000 in January 2015. While it is very profitable for certain individuals and companies (one of the reasons it takes too long to process) it is a burden on governments who already have a hard time due to the financial crisis.

When we're sober we can usually find somewhere better to piss. When drunk, this particular breed of Brit typically aims for the local area's symbol of pride. He also punches a police officer if one tries to stop him. When he gets in trouble he [calls the Foreign Office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NYHKAo5Amw).  

You can usually spot this subset of Brit by his lobster red ""tan"", lack of shirt, skinhead haircut, fake gold chain and matching St George's Flag flip flops &amp; shorts. He's normally found holding a can of Carling Black Label or whatever was the cheapest beer in the supermarket (San Miguel or Estrella in Spain, Peroni in Italy, etc) and doing a football chant at least once a day which makes him easier to detect and avoid.

The complete and utter sabotage of Greece's industry and production led to this situation, and in this sabotage the current ruling party is also highly complicit.

There are even at this moment frozen investments that could alleviate the suffering of pensioners and low-income individuals immediately with downpayments in the short term and increase in GDP and employment in the long term (e.g. the Ellinikon investment), but SYRIZA has completely shut down all of them, some directly, some indirectly by creating an infavourable environment for enterprises, and it had been working to stop them in the same way when it was in the opposition too. 

I suggest that you don't take Krugman's words as gospel, because he doesn't seem to know anything more than a few numbers about the situation, and he uses those numbers to spew an anti-euro line without being able to explain *anything* about how Greece differed from the rest of the Eurozone. But it wasn't the presence of Euro that has delayed the goldmines in Skouries from production for more than a decade, it wasn't the presence of Euro that shut down the coal industry, it wasn't the presence of the euro that shut down steel factories, that closed shipping yards or fertilizer companies. The industrial sabotage has been ongoing for 20 years.

Unless you go and review directly what shut down this and that and the other industry, no, you won't bloody explain via generalizing about the euro what caused this mess in Greece and Greece alone out of all 19 countries in the eurozone.

You and Krugman would *like* the euro to be to blame, but Greece's problems aren't being faced by the rest of the eurozone countries, and there are reasons for that. 

&gt; Besides that, their rethoric really was humiliating for you and your government.

What ""humiliates me"" is the unwillingness of other Greeks to pay their accumulated debts. What humiliates me even more is the willingness of many Greeks to side with fascists and mass-murderers against peaceful countries.

What humiliates me is my *own* government and those who support it in its lies and vileness, not Europe. I suggest that you stop judging based on your personality about what 'humiliates' me, because I'm not you, and the things that shame me aren't the things that shame you.",null,0,null,1435652771,null,0,1435653044,0,csncmfm,null,t3_3bhnp6,null,t1_csncmfm,null,t1_csncb95,null,null,null,1437458604,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Greece cannot leave the Eurozone without first leaving the European Union.

&gt; Greece leaves the NATO, US declares the Greek goverment a dictatorship and proceeds with the Freedom protocol. Or even worse, the Turks do.

The US won't have to do anything. We have enough hostile nations around us. Albania and FYROM will, without our veto, join the European Union (the latter under the name Macedonia) and the tensions will rise with the other countries having the upper hand. Turkey will take an even more agressive stance.

Even though people love to cry terror about the lack of support from the EU/US, I'd like to see how they think that the Imia crysis would have been solved without the EU support and, especially, the US did to ensure that the hostilities are ceased.

If we leave the EU and the NATO, we are done for.

Throw in a single same-end last-mile provider and you can fix your fees across a growing portfolio of countries.

That or Three have managed to use their own coverage network and done a like-for-like swap (or close to it) with an American company. I'm not sure who that is but it's the most likely answer. I know Vodafone buddy up with SFR in France, but they still have roaming fees. My personal suspicion is that there's no need for that and they're abusing the status quo because both of them are too big to fail. Scrappy smaller companies like Three have to pull out the stops to get the customers in to compensate for a questionable reputation.

I have no doubt that roaming fees will one day disappear, but it will be the natural consequence of market competition and market demand, not legislation promoted by people who don't see the big picture.

""No"" almost certainly leads to the exit of Greece out of the Euro. Then Germany loses a lot of the money owed by Greece, but most people think that money is lost anyway. The good thing is Germany does not have to pay more money. Greece gets its own currency and it will be tough for the 1-3 years but eventually Greece will come back strong.

""Yes"" leads to reforms in Greece. Good thing is the probability Germany will get at least some of the money owed back is higher than with ""No"". But Greece will need more money in the future. Either way, after the reforms Greece will come back strong.

Unfortunately what sucks is that with both options the Greek populous and especially the poor will have to suffer through a lot. Germans know that too.

E l’effetto aumenta con l’allungarsi del nome: ""un certo quale spiritello"", ""una certa quale condiscendenza"", ecc. ».Insomma, secondo il Fochi, essendo il qual tronco una cosa storicamente morta, c’è solo il quale da elidere; perciò, apostrofo.
&gt; E sentiamo Bruno Migliorini: « Che si scriva un uomo e non un’uomo, un enorme peso e invece un’enorme ingiustizia è una distinzione non fondata sulla fonetica ma sulla schematizzazione dei grammatici. Distinzione artificiale è perciò quella fra ""troncamento"" e ""elisione"", ma una volta che questa distinzione si accetti, ne discende come un corollario ineluttabile che si debba scrivere senza apostrofo tal è, qual è... ».
&gt; L’argomento del Fochi fa riflettere, è vero. Ma ha qualche punto debole. Anzitutto l’esempio un certo quale spiritello non è acconcio; diciamo quale spiritello e non qual spiritello solo perché è buona norma non troncare davanti a parola che cominci con s impura.
&gt; Inoltre il Fochi cita onestamente alcuni esempi di sopravvivenza di qual.
&gt; Aggiungiamo, pignoli, il diffuso « Qual buon vento ti porta? »; e quattro citazioni di scrittori: « E qual rispetto dal concessionario... » (Domenico Rea); « ...senza qual sacro pudore » (Riccardo Bacchelli); « Qual testimone veridico... » (Carlo Emilio Gadda); « ... qual più qual meno » (Virgilio Lilli). Queste nostre quattro citazioni, ne siamo certi, possono aumentare, anche se non di molto. E allora, è proprio morto il qual?
&gt; Ma il nostro discorso è un altro. Franco Fochi sostiene che si deve scrivere qual’è ma non condanna come errore qual è; insomma egli ha messo o rimesso di moda un’altra duplice grafia del patrio idioma. Con tutte le parole che si possono scrivere in due, tre, quattro modi, non ce n’era davvero bisogno.

Doubt it. If any competition is created it'll be through commercial deals direct with the networks - i.e. how it's worked for the last 15 years with MVNOs. I don't see any network operator tolerating abuse of roaming as a means of competition.

&gt; I also doubt that the telecoms would suffer that much, you can already get 'free' roaming with some subscriptions at a few of them. 

Yes, but that is typically with companies that own lots of networks. e.g. Vodafone doing cheap or no-cost roaming on its networks in other countries, 3 doing the same with Feel at Home. It's worth pointing out that you can't use these for permanent roaming - 3 give you something like 90 days per year of roaming before they'll cut you off, so that you can't use a cheap UK SIM with unlimited data permanently in Denmark or Australia

Are internal devaluations really better than external devaluations? (The UK had an external devaluation during 2009 and many economists have argued that this kept unemployment relatively low.) I don't think Greece has devalued enough. It has to devalue further and it is very difficult to do this in the euro.

&gt; The point is, while lower exchange rates are good for exports in principle, this seems to be more about the expectation of continuous devaluation, and the economic and political uncertainty, and any benefits wouldn't make up for the downsides.

As of today's date, there is amost nothing we can do about economic and political uncertainty for Greece. The only way we can do anything about them, is by going back in time.

&gt; No European country is sitting there, busting their balls to ""help"" Greece out of their pure heart of gold. They are making profit out of it.

Well, every country has been hit by the crisis in some way or another. It's hard to sell to your voters ""let's give Greece XX billion euros"" when the people are demanding better jobs, healthcare, education or road maintenance for themselves (it's the people's money after all). You must sell it as ""but we're going to make a profit from it"". This is particularly true from countries that have standards of living lower than Greece itself (Eastern European in particular).

The whole bailout however is based on the concept of ""reduced profits"". Greece was borrowing money at 10%+ interest rate, which was the ""fair"" rate on the market but also unsustainable. The EU agreed to lend money at X%. The difference, 10-X, is what the EU is actually losing (as in ""opportunity cost"") by lending money to Greece. To make up for this reduction in profit the EU requested a reduction in risk, therefore the evil ""austerity"".

&gt; For instance, ever since the austerity measures were well established in our economy, there was a significant rise in German imports.

Is there any particular contact clause that imposes this by force? Or is it simply government/people/companies having slightly more money than before the bailout and buying german products? Hard to tell without more data...

&gt; Also, a lot of public sectors were auctioned to private detainers and to my knowledge, bought by foreign companies. 

As you said here, they were auctioned. Rich Greeks could have bought them, they didn't. If you have money problems but have assets, it is only logical to sell those assets (unless the assets produce more profit than the interest rate of your loan, then you should fight not to sell them).

&gt; we cannot afford to pay back that much and those governments, disregarding our situation entirely, force us to cough up money that we can't afford to lose if we actually want to stir our economy instead of just paying back a debt.

Yes, but you paint those governments as mafia types that somehow woke up one day and decided to fuck up a country. The payments were agreed and established long time ago, and everyone knew they were coming...

Additionally, the whole ""austerity"" program was done exactly so Greece would be able to afford those payments (from what I've read, I'm not an economist). Now it seems that the Greek government refuses to implement the measures that would make them save money and then complains about not having money. That is the look from the outside, at least.

&gt; Basically, instead of giving a poor man a job and asking him to pay you back a bit of what he owes you each month, you beat him up and just demand of him to somehow find the money by ""stop spending so much"".

Have you tried to look at it from the other side? For the other countries is like a man that has a job that pays 1000 euros a month and he insists on living spending 1200 euros buying alcohol and cigarettes (unnecessary spending), working only 6h a day (early retirement), letting people steal from him (tax fraud) and driving a luxury car (the aforementioned assets).

There are people that make 3000 euros a month and spend 2.950 working 8h a day that have saved some and are willing to lend money and probably can afford to make no profit at all from the whole ordeal (Germany, Netherlands, etc). It doesn't help to go on the street comparing this countries to Hitler, but well, sometimes you need to vent.

Now, keep in mind that in the lenders group there are also people like you, that are struggling (Spain, Italy) and lend you money instead of fixing their own problems, Spain IIRC lent Greece 26 billion euros while having higher unemployment themselves (27%, almost 60% for young workers). Even poor people that make 300 euros a month working 10h a day (eastern countries). It's very hard to convince them to lend money to someone who works less, lives better and on top of that is complaining all the time. Poland for instance is looking to lose 7 billion euros that they desperately need.

Finally, since the crisis started Greece has received hundreds of billions of euros, at least. All Greeks that I have read agreed that the conditions in the country have only gotten worse in this time. Have you even wondered... where did all this enormous amount of money go? Maybe there you can find some bad guys...",null,0,null,1435656013,null,0,false,0,csnddhs,null,t3_3bhnp6,null,t1_csnddhs,null,t1_csnb9m4,null,null,null,1437459200,null,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4,null

And I'm not going to be too hard on you because the assumption is very easy to make, but 2 million Syrian refugees are much more difficult to handle for Lebanon than they would be for a similarly-sized European country, like Switzerland or Sweden. Why? you say. Well, even leaving aside the fact millions of refugees use infrastructures that the Lebanese budget is rather less fit to maintain than a European one would be, I think anyone from a certain age remembers that Lebanon isn't exactly the most stable country. I mean, ten years ago, people said ""Beirut"" for a very complex and messy situation, where they now say ""Baghdad"".

Lebanon was historically created as a Christian-majority country in the Middle East, though even by the time it reached independence in the 1940s, Christians were no longer the majority but a plurality. So Maronite Christians (the main Lebanese Christian denomination) concluded what is called the National Pact with Sunni Muslims: they'd rule together. In the 1970s, due to demographic trends, the Shia Muslims and the Druze wanted the end of the Pact that discriminated against them, and the left wing in general wanted a more democratic regime. This started the Lebanese civil war, which went on for 15 years, destroying much of the country, seeing invasions by Israel and Syria (both of which would hang around until after the end of the war). After the war, a new National Pact was created which have more place to the Shia. This was considered the absolute worse solution, at the exception of all the others. And when the Syrians *finally* fucked off, in 2005, after the turmoil caused by the assassination of Rafic Hariri, the country was slowly, steadily brought back to life. Nowadays the country is roughly 30% Sunni, 30% Shia, 30% Maronite and 10% other (Druze and other Christians).

So, I'm sorry for the historical wall of text, but what the hell do you think dumping 2 million more or less all Sunni refugees on this poor country does to the very fragile balances of Lebanon? I'll tell you: turmoil. The Lebanese National Assembly has failed to produce either a President or a government in six months, and while that may seem a normal delay to Belgians, in the location and the context Lebanon is, having strong institutions is a must.

So to answer your assumption, no, 2 million Syrians in Lebanon are more dangerous than 2 million Syrians anything else, since in Lebanon they might create another Civil War, which isn't the case in any European country (aside from maybe San Marino for sheer lack of space).",null,0,null,1435656374,null,0,false,0,csndgem,null,t3_3blyxy,null,t1_csndgem,null,t1_csncych,null,null,null,1437459249,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

As for -50%, that is what could be *claimed*- as in, it was the percepted inflation. If one watches the inflation rate even during 2001/2, it was nowhere near that. By far. Some selected goods and services almost doubled their price - true - but in the 98/02 period; and this was compensated by the huge drop in price of a lot of other goods and services. Electronics and telecomunications are the textbook example. Bottom line, and we go to the original link on ppp, people who receive the average wage today can buy -0.44% goods and stuff that they could in 2000.

The main issue is not financial (the tree) but geopolitical (the forest).
Germany for the third time in 100 years is trying to dominate the continent. Voting NO at the referendum means we are against a European Union under german hegemony.
For the same exact reason Britain is expected to leave the union too, as they have always been against a european union under the rule of a single state (three times in the last 200 years, they sent their youth to die, stopping such attempts).
What ever happened to presidency of the EU alternating between countries every 6 months?? If the union was democratic, Greece should now be negotiating with Latvia, the current president of the EU, not with Germany!!

Instead on focusing on money, people should focus on saving democracy in the union or getting the hell out of there. 
And if Britain leaves the EU, if tensions keep on rising with Russia, if France remains submissive and if German hegemony remains, then we will be closer to the classic formula of a 1941 United Europe in its neoliberal reincarnation.
A Europe noone wants.

The greek referendum in essence is not about 13% or 23% or the pensions and whatever.
It's about using democracy to fight against Germany's status quo as the ""boss of us all"".

Yes, but as you say it would also disrupt the markets massively and lead to more oligopolies.

Telecoms is notoriously volatile, competitive and aggressive. Not 10 years ago people were saying that BT were a sleepy mess of a dying company and only subsisted because of legacy contracts from when they were nationalised. When they entered the fibre market it took a few years to shake off the dust. 4 years ago ADSL with BE Unlimited was still giving my mate better speeds than my brother's BT fibre. Over the last 6 months there has been constant noise about whether the competition commission needs to step in because BT are on the verge of a monopoly with their insanely good quad-play package (4G mobile through the EE acquisition, EPL and CL on TV, fibre optic broadband, and of course their never-ending and permanent monopoly on fixed point telephone sockets). That's a near meteoric rise in competitiveness.

Forcing companies into a situation where they start partnering up across the continent could/would lead to a situation where moderate/large companies would eventually merge and become conglomerates, shutting out the smaller guys, and big business only does business with big business. It would be bad for SME suppliers who specialise in one or two things, and be great news for Cofely or MITIE or whoever when they inevitably diversify into telecoms to start creaming the services market. Is that good for business? Is that good for smaller companies?

Look at the European markets. They have like one Tier 1 provider each. In the UK we have more because when British Rail was sold off they gave the telecoms network to Ralcal instead of BT. That act alone pretty much saved our telco industry. Which country has the best rates in the EU for consumer contracts, handset costs notwithstanding? The first time I saw the cost of a French contract with SFR on my Erasmus year I almost coughed up a testicle. In the UK I get unlimited texts, all you can eat data, 600 minutes (that's 10 hours and who needs that, honestly?), all for £10/month. That's the direct impact of market competition. SIM only contracts took much longer to hit other markets.

Megacompanies would no doubt lead to cheaper prices for a while but it would also mean that the market would start to solidify, and in a fast paced industry which needs to be flexible to adapt to new technologies, I'm just not sold on the idea of forcing the industry to start forming uber-multinational companies. Once that happens, they can just start edging prices up anyway and the market will be too rigid to allow cheaper smaller providers to spring up to meet the inevitable demand for cheaper prices.

Telecoms isn't a perfect world but it's fluidity keeps it on edge. Competition in a consumer-driven industry which relies on rapidly implementing new technology to stay relevant is, IMVHO, a good thing for customers in the round. If there were only 2 major Tier 1 providers costs wouldn't be competitive, and advancement wouldn't be rapid. Where would the impetus come from?

Legislation isn't the answer to solving the issue of roaming fees (and I accept that it's an issue). I maintain, roaming fees will disappear eventually, but only when customers vote with their wallets. If they disappeared now there would be undesirable consequences. Forcing a heavy, idealistic hand through legislation will, IMO, create waves. I'm not an idiot who thinks that it will all come crashing down and we'd go back to smoke signals, but the status quo furnishes competitiveness, especially in the UK.",null,0,null,1435657595,null,0,false,0,csndqd5,null,t3_3blpx9,null,t1_csndqd5,null,t1_csndasj,null,null,null,1437459369,null,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4,null

Your government wanted to make this not about money, but about principles. Now it is about the principle.

Everything you said supposes the the EU is ""forcing"" GReece to spend less; the market reality is forcing GReece to spend less, as no one on the open market will lend money to Greece anymore. If the EU countries would not have provided emergency loans, at cost lower than what it cost those countries to get on the open market, Greece would have collapsed, and the Pensions payments would be 0€. 

Greece is spending other peoples money to finance a lavish (compared to other states) government spending. Greece agreed to reform in return for money. Now the other countries will hold you to your promise and make you reform, because you are spending their money. If you spend your own money you can do what you want.

Your fuck up is not our fault, and should not cost us 100s of billions every year, without end, because you refuse to make cuts, even when painful, that are still obviously necessary, because again, YOU ARE SPENDING OTHER PEOPLES MONEY.

The country already suffers from unemployment, and manual labor jobs are being filled by Syrians who are flooding the market for cheap, leaving the already poor Lebanese individuals that used to fill these positions jobless.

Add to that the religious diversity (Sunni/Shia/Christian) and the influx of a Sunni majority now, with border clashes every now and then. And after every conflict, fighters hide away in refugee camps and leaves the army tied up, not able to pursue them for fear of civilian casualties. Civilians are also threatened by these fighters who will kill them if they turn them in.

Lebanon and Syria have had a long and bitter history. Not everyone here is welcoming of the Syrian refugees. As for the refugees themselves, they are getting disruptive and dangerous, with an increase in crimes committed by these refugees.

Despite all of that, the refugee camps are always filled with volunteers from the UN and from local NGOs. Every day people collect food and clothes and basic living material and send it to the camps.

The problem is exactly between moral statement (""The Greek people will not be humiliated any more!"") and the wider economy (""Create a sustainable economy that isn't based on loans"").

The bailout was supposed to prop Greece up while it sold off most of its *extremely* debt-ridden state companies (the state railway company alone owes 11 bil. euros), lower government costs and increase cash reserves. In the 5 years since they've started, they only managed to sell off companies worth ~3 bil. euros instead of the promised 15 bil.

The problem is that when Greece accepted the original bailout, it accepted the requirements it came with. They did try to make cuts, but the ones they did were ineffective and generally targeted the poorest strata, which was a failure of the previous government which lead to getting Tspiras getting elected, and when Syriza came to power, they declared all deals null-and-void and tried to renegotiate new ones.

null,false,petrux,null,null,null,"Il termine ""teoria del Gender"" è un termine che viene usato convenzionalmente e a posteriori per indicare l'ipotesi (a grana molto grossa) che sta alla base dei c.d. gender studies. Tale assunto è che l'identità sessuale di un individuo sia in realtà scomponibile in più dimensioni e queste siano naturalmente incorrelate al sesso biologico. Ti riporto un paio di citazioni dalla voce ""[Genere](http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/genere/)"" dell'enciclopedia Treccani (notoriamente costruita nottetempo da alcuni ultracattolici post-vandeani): 

&gt; Il concetto di g. stato introdotto negli anni 1960 dai medici statunitensi R. Stoller e J. Money del Johns Hopkins Hospital di Baltimora per distinguere l’orientamento psicosessuale (gender) di una persona dal suo sesso anatomico (sex). Chiamati a determinare chirurgicamente il sesso di neonati o di adulti anatomicamente ermafroditi, essi tendevano a farlo in conformità con le aspettative dei genitori, oppure con i ruoli sociali che i pazienti erano abituati a svolgere, **nella convinzione che il g. non è dato dal sesso di una persona, ma varia in modo indipendente dal dato biologico.**
[...]
&gt; **La cultura del g. conduce all’idea che la differenza maschile-femminile non coincide necessariamente con la differenza maschio-femmina, poiché le caratteristiche di g. (o stereotipi) sarebbero frutto di una costruzione culturale.** Elaborati per contestare le teorie che considerano naturali le ineguaglianze tra i sessi e le diversità sociali tra uomo e donna, i gender studies prendono le mosse dall’idea che si possa costruire l’uguaglianzasenza tenere conto delle differenze. La prospettiva del g. mette così in discussione il fondamento biologico-naturale della differenza fra i sessi: femminilità, mascolinità, eterosessualità e maternità non vengono più considerati stati naturali, ma stati ‘culturali’, non definitivi e in alcun modo determinanti. In altre parole, l’uso del termine gender in luogo del termine sex dischiude la possibilità di non definire più la persona a partire dalla sua struttura biologica (corpo), potendosi viceversa definire in base alla sua ‘autocomprensione’ psico-sociale. Le conseguenze più marcate di questo approccio sono emerse nell’ambito delle Conferenze mondiali sulla donna, a partire dal 1995, con l’affermazione politica del pensiero multi-gender, di tipo costruttivista, sollecitato dal libertarismo e dal soggettivismo, che si fa portatore della libertà di scelta dell’orientamento sessuale in base a preferenze, pulsioni e desideri soggettivi. **Ne deriva che con l’identificazione esclusiva della persona come g., piuttosto che come essere sessuato a partire da una corporeità, si giunge alla neutralizzazione dell’identità sessuata.** Il gender, infatti, si presta a essere inteso come concetto neutro, né femminile né maschile: può, infatti, essere uomo, donna, ma anche gay, lesbica o transessuale, a seconda delle preferenze soggettive. **La persona, così, non viene più valorizzata nella sua individualità sessuata, nel suo essere uomo o donna, bensì appiattita nell’ambito di un’indifferenza di g., nella quale uomini e donne vengono percepiti come semplicemente ‘uguali’ e tutte le differenze biologiche, di ruolo, di caratteri vengono annullate, dimenticando il significato essenziale della bipolarità sessuale e la sua struttura oggettiva.**

Altri clerico-fascisti, sempre nottetempo, si sono inventati un personaggio fittizio, tale [Judith Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler) e le hanno fatto scrivere un libro fittizio, intitolato *The Gender Trouble* riguardo al quale, la suddetta rilascia un'intervista a *Le Nouvel Observateur*, nota pubblicazione clericale, nel dicembre del 2013 [in cui dichiara](http://www.lavoroculturale.org/sulla-teoria-del-gender-judith-butler/):

&gt; Intanto ritengo importante precisare di non aver inventato gli “studi di genere” (gender studies): la categoria di “genere” era infatti già in uso dagli anni Sessanta, negli Stati Uniti, sia all’interno della ricerca sociologica, sia in quella antropologica. In Francia, invece, in particolare sotto l’influsso di Lévi-Strauss, si è preferito parlare di “differenze sessuali”. **La cosiddetta “teoria del gender” prende dunque piede solo tra gli anni Ottanta e Novanta, innestandosi proprio all’incrocio tra l’antropologia statunitense e lo strutturalismo francese.** 

P.S. poi si può discutere dell'usare il termine ""gender theory"", ma è una questione convenzionale. Allo stesso modo in cu Jovanotti dice ""il più grande spettacolo dopo il Big Bang"" e non ""il più grande spettacolo dopo [l'esplosione dell'atomo primigenio](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre#Ricerche)"", ma tant'è.

Tsipras' unwillingness to make cuts **is not** what led to this crisis. Tsipras' wouldn't be in power right now if there weren't already a crisis. Europe's refusal to recognize that there was a severe crisis was ultimately going to come to a head, this was unavoidable.

From the third paragraph of the article:

&gt; ""net neutrality"" - the principle by which all internet traffic is treated equally.

The whole point of net neutrality is that _there are no exceptions_. ""Fast-lanes"" are an exception and as a consequence they break net neutrality.

Having made this clear, how is the title editorialized? 
 
For more info on how this affects net neutrality you can see this other comment (or just wikipedia net neutrality):

https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/3blxaz/eu_cripples_net_neutrality_by_proposing_fast_lanes/csndpvt

Note that _money does not have to be involved_ at all. Lots of telecoms (service providers) are also content providers. This would allow them to deliver traffic to their services via these ""faster lanes"", or in other words, deliver traffic to the contents of their competitors via ""slower lanes"". 

For example this would allow a content provider with a huge market share like Deutsche Telekom to push their content services (Internet TV) into their users by making the services of its competitors (Netflix, iTunes, ...) unusably slow. If the law allows this, pushing a competitor out of the market is _priceless_. 

The whole point of net neutrality is to prevent these things from happening, and the concept is simple: internet providers deliver traffic everywhere with the same quality, no exceptions of any kind allowed.",null,0,null,1435658937,null,0,1435663658,0,csne111,null,t3_3blxaz,null,t1_csne111,null,t1_csnd65j,null,null,null,1437459431,null,5,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,5,null

Doubt it.

&gt; Also, why is the choice of word interesting? The thread is about ""bearing the brunt of the refugee crisis"".

Because you chose to say ""mass"" immigration, which makes it sound more ""heavy"" and ""overburdening"" and all that. Choosing to say mass immigration does show a bit of how you view it.

&gt;All Syrian refugees together (4 million) would barely be 0.1% of Europe's total population.

It was actually 1%, Europe's 400 mill I think

&gt;These aren't really the same as immigrant integration though. We never decided that we should increase the amount of unemployed youth and seniors, whereas opening your borders to unqualified workers is a conscious decision. It creates a problem you didn't have.

We didn't create the ""problem"" of immigration. Why do you see immigration as such a huge issue? Personally, I don't experience any trouble with immigrants at all. Europe pays more to bail out banks and to fund large farming companies than to support immigrants/refugees. We can't take 'm all in, but that's a holllow argument because we aren't taking them all in. People overestimate immigration all the time.

And how would you solve the issues? These immigrants flee from poverty/opression/poor living standards/wars/climatological issues... and those issues will only worsen. Do you want to seal off Europe or something? Only rich people get in?

Immigration is not a ""problem"" it's been around since forever and it's what has been driving mankind forward... if there was no immigration we'd all still be in some savanna in Ethiopia.

The real problem is the culture clash and the polarizing between cultures by the media and politics. And that's a problem we created, in our minds.

While the politicians clamour about ""how much we pay to immigrants"" they're throwing around billions of euros to compensate investors, etc, all that, or fasttracking shady TTIP deals.",null,0,null,1435659066,null,0,1435659394,0,csne22h,null,t3_3blyxy,null,t1_csne22h,null,t1_csne0ly,null,null,null,1437459441,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

I'm not sure about other countries, but in Austria there are industries with regional controls, i.e. only a certain number may exist in a certain area. Pharmacies and notaries come to mind. Until the mid-80s, many industries were regulated in that way, including bookstores, grocery stores and taxis. This is called ""Gebietsschutz"" (regional protection) and if you wanted to open e.g. a bookstore, there was first a ""Bedarfsprüfung"" (necessity check) if another one was necessary in that particular area. If there was already a bookstore nearby and that store didn't exceed a certain number of customers (population density was also factored in AFAIK), you would not get a license to open a store there. 

I would imagine other countries had and have similar rules for certain industries.

null,false,linklater11,null,null,null,"&gt; And where do you think that 300bn debt came from

A few reasons:

- Greece before its crisis in 2008 recapitalized the Greek banks with the taxpayers' money for 28bn. euros or 20% of the GDP if my math is correct.

- Crony capitalism with the same oligarchs getting assigned overpriced public works. The same oligarchs have close ties with the banking system that was lending them absurd amounts of money with no guarantees. We have a word for that in Greece from the junta era. Thalassodaneia or sea loans because the junta was giving away loans for hotels, tourism etc. and the oligarchs were taking them without guarantees and instead of investing they were getting for personal interests. Prime example the Olympic games where the forecasted spending was doubled while noone knowing where exactly the money went. Another example, the common bribing of the politicians from corporations in order to get public works or to buy. Such as Siemens which is the biggest bribery scandal in Greece.

- Tax evasion. These same oligarchs have enganged in large scale tax evasion with off-shore companies and moving to tax heavens (like Luxemburg or Netherlands in EU) throughout legal loopholes. Ship owners, even though they make billions, they pay virtually no taxes because ""they will take their ships in another country"". There has also been widespread tax evasion in middle-class incomes because Greece has a much higher percentage of freelancers. There is a direct correlation of freelancers and tax evasion in the world.

- High defence GDP spending. Bribed politicians were in a buying frenzy with Greece having one of the highest % GDP spending *in the world*

- The last 20 years Greece has paid 600bn. euros in interest rates. Usury in action.

- Public debt ballooned in the whole world post-crisis because governments were bailing out private financial institutions that gambled and lost.

Bullshit. The recognition of severe mental illness as a valid condition for euthanasia was an important part of the debate that lead to our euthanasia legislation.

&gt; There are thousands of cases of profoundly mentally ill people that lead full and rewarding lives if they get proper treatment

And there are thousands of cases of profoundly mentally ill people that suffer endless agony each day despite getting proper treatment. What's so bad with having a choice?

&gt; what you are seeing here is the state abandoning its responsibilities to its citizenry and the medical community ignoring medical ethics.

The request was approved by several medical specialists and a medical ethics committee. Belgium is one of the very few countries that does take its responsibility to help its citizens to the very end and which does not ignore medical ethics just to prolong a patient's suffering because of some vague ""sanctity of life"" nonsense.

&gt; The political right was correct that euthanasia would be used on the young physically fit and mentally ill.

The political right voted in favour of this law. The only major opposition came from the extreme-right and the center catholic party.

&gt; Slippery slope my ass this was seen coming and all those ""progressives"" tut tuted at the concerns raised by those that value human life and are against a culture of death.

Once again a meaningless pile of bullshit. This is no slippery slope, as this case is exactly one of the people for whom the euthanasia legislation was intended.

&gt; I guess they don't teach medical ethics anymore and your press does not keep you informed.

Our press keeps us better informed than yours and our medical ethics seem far more advanced than the ones in your society. Popular support for euthanasia is overwhelming.

&gt; Heck Christian ethics is more compassionate than the state of Belgium in this case. It is sad how far society has fallen.

Yes, such horribly monsters we are, daring to allow people to end their life in dignity on their own terms instead of forcing them through decades of physical or mental anguish until their body or mind collapses from the ordeal. Truely the most barbaric of all societies.

I pity you and the society that spawned you. It is my life, I will live it as I see fit and I will end it as I see fit.

&gt; Abstract  
&gt; 
Why is Greece such a surprisingly closed economy? We employ a gravity model of trade to explain the appallingly poor export performance of Greece and argue that weak institutional quality accounts for a large part of this shortfall. Using a rich dataset of bilateral value-added exports of goods and services of 39 exporters and 56 importers for 18 sectors, we first estimate that Greece exports ⅓  less than what regular international trade patterns would predict on basis of Greek GDP, the size of its trading partners and geographical distance. This ranks Greece at the 31st position out of 39 export countries in the competitiveness ranking we construct based on our 
regressions. The most affected sectors include electrical equipment and machinery while transport, tourism and agriculture perform relatively favourable. We then augment our model with various measures of institutional quality and find that weak institutions can explain much of the 
missing Greek exports puzzle. We estimate that structural reforms improving the Greek institutional framework to the EU/OECD average level would close between ½ and ¾ of the Greek export gap. These findings suggest that, while Greece has already achieved major improvements in cost competitiveness since the start of the Greek adjustment programme, structural reforms must also address non-cost competitiveness factors, such as the underlying institutional deficits, to unlock Greece's export growth potential.

Recognise the international source , what comic book is yours from ?  Its so far off the mark , it couldn't be credible. 

Excuse my comic book invective but after your hostile comments about me , I felt the need to prove that I draw my information from facts and numbers. 

£19 out of every £20 has been cut from hospitals. 

Data from the Greek central bank, which records each euro that leaves the country as a liability, suggest the capital flight has reached unprecedented proportions. Over the six months through March(2015), about 62 billion euros ($67 billion) were taken out of Greece. That's the equivalent of about a third of the country's gross domestic product. Here is a [chart](http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iqVliJ.krzTw/v2/-1x-1.png) 

Their debt is 180% of their GDP which shows that they are so overwhelmed by debt that these continued loans to pay off bankers debt exacerbates the problem instead of solving it. 

""According to Der Spiegel’s Christian Rickens, the second bailout package “isn’t geared to the requirements of the people of Greece but to the needs of the international financial markets, meaning the banks.” 
Rickens makes a strong point.  “How else,” he asks, “can one explain the fact that around a quarter of the package won’t even arrive in Athens but will flow directly to the country’s international creditors?”  He explains that about €30 billion will go to holders of Greek government bonds “as an incentive to convert old paper into new bonds.”

So the economy shrinks , the debt gets higher while the end gets pushed further and further away , public services get decimated , public companies get sold off , unemployment above 25% (Youth unemployment 60%) , suicides up 30% , between 15,000 and 18,000 homeless in Athens alone, the Greek people get poorer and the humanitarian crisis(Junker and the EU's words , not mine) worsens. 

Am I saying that this is all the fault of the bankers ? No , but it isn't the fault of the Greek public either. 

What's happening at the moment is the Troika attempting to bleed dry a rock and it's slowly starting to understand that if you keep smashing a rock against the ground eventually you just start to bleed yourself. 

So tell me are we a European UNION or is the whole unity thing just bullshit ? 

Now lets get back to political ideology for a minute. The socialist and left sided politicians who are going from strength to strength in European countries are a DIRECT RESPONSE to the poor fiscal management by a right sided European Union. They are the yang to the EU's Ying. Are they playing on peoples fears for popularity ? Quite possibly. 

So ask yourself the question .. Is there a political reason why the Troika does not want to write down debts to a manageable level for a left sided government voted in as a direct response to extreme austerity ? Let bare in mind that lefty political parties are on the rise in all of the countries that have been affected directly by austerity and are still on bailout packages. Makes you think .. doesn't it ? 

And for the record I am in no way politically affiliated. I voted both centre right and centre left in the last election.

I cannot say with any authority because I had to leave the negotiations early :)

Anyhow, a huge sticking point is obviously that the EZ does not trust Greece to follow through. A lot of things that have been put in writing in 2012 and are the basis of the current ""bailout"" have not been implemented.

Debt restructuring would be part of the *next round* of talks. Personally I'd say the EZ should have issued a conditional commitment to talks about a debt cut if Greece implements the current round. But certainly I would not have followed the demand to draw debt cuts into the current round, precisely to avoid a guarantee of debt relief.

I came to a gradual stop because he seemed really mad, i was tired and it was monday. He kept going until lightly hitting my bike. He stopped, got out the taxi, flailing his arms around and shouting. He gestured towards his bumper as if i had run into him. He then came up to my face and began to try to push me off my bike, probably with the intention of starting a fist fight. I shouted ""Ayuda!

**Net Neutrality**

**Why do we need rules for net neutrality?**

Net neutrality is crucial for users and businesses. It ensures that Europeans have access to the online content and services they wish without any discrimination or interference (like blocking or slowing down) by Internet access providers. This is also very important for start-up businesses that commercialise their products and services via the Internet and need to be able to compete on an equal footing with larger players.

Until now, there have been no clear rules on net neutrality at EU level, leaving most Europeans without legal protection for their right to access the open Internet. Some EU countries have adopted national laws on net neutrality. However, in a Digital Single Market, we cannot afford that 28 Member States adopt 28 different approaches on that issue. The freedom of European citizens to access or distribute Internet content must not depend on the country in which they are. Having an EU law on net neutrality will avoid further fragmentation of telecoms regulation in Europe.

**What has been agreed?**

The rules enshrine the principle of net neutrality into EU law: no blocking or throttling of online content, applications and services. It means that there will be truly common EU-wide Internet rules, contributing to a single market and reversing current fragmentation.

Every European must be able to have access to the open Internet and all content and service providers must be able to provide their services via a high-quality open Internet.
All traffic will be treated equally. This means, for example, that there can be no paid prioritisation of traffic in the Internet access service. At the same time, equal treatment allows reasonable day-to-day traffic management according to justified technical requirements, and which must be independent of the origin or destination of the traffic.

**How does this agreement balance out the interests of industry and consumers?**

The agreed rules establish a right of all Internet end-users (consumers and businesses) to access and distribute legal content, services and applications of their choice. The agreement allows efficient network management by Internet service providers, subject to clear and strict rules. This means that consumers will have no obstacles to access any online services and applications over their Internet access, now and in the future, when faster Internet access and new applications will be available.

The rules also enable continued network and service innovation by defining the principles underpinning the relationship between Internet access services and innovative services with specific quality requirements. The rules will ensure that the quality of the open Internet access service will not be hampered by the provision of services such as IPTV or telemedicine which share the same infrastructure. These innovative services may only be offered where and if sufficient capacity for Internet access remains available.

**Will there be paid prioritisation services in the open Internet?**

Under today's agreement, paid prioritisation in the open Internet will be banned. Based on this new legislation, all content and application providers will have guaranteed access to end-users in the open Internet. This access should not be dependent on the will or particular commercial interest of Internet service providers. These providers will not be able to block or throttle traffic in their networks or give priority to some particular content or services in exchange of payment. At the same time, end-users and providers of Internet access will continue being able to agree on different access speeds and data volumes as they do today.

**What are the exceptions in the open Internet for traffic management?**

The rules will prohibit any blocking, throttling, degradation or discrimination of Internet traffic by Internet service providers. This general prohibition is subject to a limited number of tightly defined exceptions:

- to comply with Union or national legislation related to the lawfulness of content or with criminal law, or with measures implementing this legislation such as a decision by public authorities or a court order, for instance if a judge or the police have ordered blocking of specific illegal content;
- to preserve the security and integrity of the network, for instance to prevent misuse of a network and combat viruses, malware or denial of services attacks;
- to minimise network congestion that is temporary or exceptional. This means that operators cannot invoke this exception if their network is frequently congested due to under-investment and capacity scarcity;
- to filter spam, if users want to avoid such unsolicited communications, as well as to allow parents to set up parental filters that block pornography or gratuitous violence, with the prior request or consent of end-users and the possibility to withdraw the consent, and thus such filters, at any time.
**
What are specialised services (innovative services or services other than Internet access services)?**

The new EU net neutrality rules guarantee the open Internet and enable the provision of specialised or innovative services on condition that they do not harm the open Internet access.These are services like IPTV, high-definition videoconferencing or healthcare services like telesurgery. They use the Internet protocol and the same access network but require a significant improvement in quality or the possibility to guarantee some technical requirements to their end-users that cannot be ensured in the best-effort open Internet. The possibility to provide innovative services with enhanced quality of service is crucial for European start-ups and will boost online innovation in Europe. However, such services must not be a sold as substitute for the open Internet access, they come on top of it.

**By allowing the provision of innovative services, are we not promoting a two-tier Internet?**

No. Every European must be able to have access to the open Internet and all content and service providers will be able to provide their services via a high-quality open Internet. But more and more innovative services require a certain transmission quality in order to work properly, such as telemedicine or automated driving. These and other services that can emerge in the future can be developed as long as they do not harm the availability and the quality of the open Internet.

Therefore it is important to have future proof rules which, while fully safeguarding the open Internet, allow market operators to provide services with specific quality requirements in order to provide them in safe manner. It is not a question of fast lanes and slow lanes - as paid prioritisation is not allowed, but of making sure that all needs are served, that all opportunities can be seized and that no one is forced to pay for a service that is not needed.

**What is zero rating?**

Zero rating, also called sponsored connectivity, is a commercial practice used by some providers of Internet access, especially mobile operators, not to count the data volume of particular applications or services against the user's limited monthly data volume.

Zero rating does not block competing content and can promote a wider variety of offers for price-sensitive users, give them interesting deals, and encourage them to use digital services. But we have to make sure that commercial practices benefit users and do not in practice lead to situations where end-users' choice is significantly reduced. Regulatory authorities will therefore have to monitor and ensure compliance with the rules.

**What is the role of national regulatory authorities?**

National regulatory authorities shall monitor and enforce the open Internet rules. These authorities will thus have the power and obligation to examine the traffic management practices of Internet service providers and the effect of their commercial practices on the end-users' (consumers and businesses) rights to access and distribute content, applications and services of their choice. They will further have to ensure that the quality of the open Internet access service reflects advances in technology and that it is not degraded by traffic discrimination through Internet service providers or by the provision of specialised or innovative services.

Regulators are also empowered to set minimum quality of service requirements on Internet access providers and other appropriate and necessary measures to ensure that all end-users enjoy an open Internet access service of good quality.
**
What will happen if a service provider will not respect open Internet rules?**

The regulation will oblige Member States to set rules on the penalties applicable to infringements of the net neutrality provisions. These penalties have to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. This means that providers infringing the net neutrality rules will face significant pecuniary and administrative sanctions.

**Does the agreement respect existing EU data protection and privacy legislation?**

The Commission has paid high attention to the importance of protecting privacy and personal data. The agreement explicitly limits the processing of data to what is necessary and proportionate to achieve the objectives of traffic management. And the processing of this data has to be done in accordance withexisting EU data protection and privacy legislation.

**Why are the new net neutrality rules the strongest in the world?**

The EU rules to guarantee the open Internet are a comprehensive set of measures that ensures flexibility for innovation and at the same time empowers subscribers to know transparently if they get the internet quality that they pay for and to terminate their contracts if this is not the case.",null,0,null,1435661472,null,0,1435661722,0,csnem06,null,t3_3blxaf,null,t1_csnem06,null,t3_3blxaf,null,null,null,1437459830,null,24,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,24,null

**Why have net neutrality and roaming rules only been agreed today? What happened to the other elements of the Commission's initial proposal?**

The European Commission presented its proposal for a telecoms single market ('Connected Continent') in September 2013 (press release). The European Parliament voted on its first reading of the draft legislation in April 2014 (press release). The Council adopted a mandate to negotiate in March 2015 (press release).

Following the adoption of the Digital Single Market Strategy by the Commission on 6 May, Heads of State and Government agreed on 26 June on the need to strengthen the EU telecoms single market, as part of the Digital Single Market.

After 18 months of negotiations, today the European Parliament, Council and Commission reached two milestone agreements on an end to roaming charges and on the first EU-wide rules on net neutrality.

These measures will be completed by an ambitious overhaul of EU telecoms rules in 2016. This reform will include a more effective EU-level spectrum coordination. Creating the right conditions for digital networks and services to flourish is a key objective of the Commission's plan for a Digital Single Market.

The problem with tourism is that it is already running near full capacity and increasing this capacity takes years. Still a good thing even though it creates rather low-paying jobs and at some point destroys the beauty of the country (cf. costa brava).

How a weak currency can strengthen the energy sector in a country that imports most crude is also not clear to me.

The thing is: devaluating the currency means Yanis Sixpackis, the man in the street has to pay. Want to buy a new car?

Kid I was around when this was debated mental illness was never brought up.  The debate centered on terminal illness in the end stages of the ailment only.  You don't get to re-write history.

&gt;And there are thousands of cases of profoundly mentally ill people that suffer endless agony each day despite getting proper treatment.

You don't stop because it is difficult period.

&gt;What's so bad with having a choice?

Because of the slippery slope.  It has been used on a prisoner that has no mental illness and no terminal illness.  Again this is Belgium abandoning its obligations to persons in it custody and ignoring a just and legal prison sentence.  You clearly don't follow the issue there are more and more cases of euthanasia being abused even for monetary gain.

Source:   http://www.procon.org/headline.php?headlineID=005234

&gt;The request was approved by several medical specialists and a medical ethics committee.

In Belgium activist have set up a rubber stamp network that does not follow protocol and does not due its diligence.  they operate like doctors that run pill mills for opioid  medication.

&gt;Belgium is one of the very few countries that does take its responsibility to help its citizens to the very end and which does not ignore medical ethics just to prolong a patient's suffering because of some vague ""sanctity of life"" nonsense.

That does not explain why are they offing there prisoner when the death penalty is illegal.  It is not sanctity of life that is the medical ethics being violated.  In the medical community there are concepts like standard of care (euthanasia is not the standard of care for mental illness), off label use (it is against medical ethics to use medication against its intended use), then there is best practices (euthanasia is not the best practice for mental illness).  The issue is far more complex than you take it to be and you can't just hand wave valid objections to euthanasia as ""vague sanctity of life as the only valid concern.  Then there is the social contract of having socialized medicine the government promises to care for and provide medical care for its people this now provides a way to shed the cost of mental illness which in economic terms is a moral hazard.

&gt;The political right voted in favour of this law. The only major opposition came from the extreme-right and the center catholic party.

Not true thanks for re-writing history again to suit your narrative.

&gt;Once again a meaningless pile of bullshit. This is no slippery slope, as this case is exactly one of the people for whom the euthanasia legislation was intended.

Untrue the slippery slope is valid in is case as the original law did not allow for this.  Activist at the time said euthanasia would only be limited to the terminally ill and those same activist said that those that said it would be applied to the mentally ill where using scare tactics and hyperbole.  Now we see it being applied to a population group they said it would not be applied.

&gt;Our press keeps us better informed than yours and our medical ethics seem far more advanced than the ones in your society.

lol what ever.  The US press has far more journalist and news bureaus and runs the major news wire services.   Press Association, Thomson Reuters and United Press International none of those are Belgium.  Most of you major press is state run think about that you news goes through the filter of your government.

&gt;Yes, such horribly monsters we are, daring to allow people to end their life in dignity on their own terms instead of forcing them through decades of physical or mental anguish until their body or mind collapses from the ordeal. Truely the most barbaric of all societies.

See that is the fundamental difference in Christian ethics all life has value.  The duty to care and provide is considered a noble occupation that desire to alleviate suffering is what has saved thousands of mentally ill people from pain because we do not give up on people when they feel like giving up.  Your way of think disregards the bonds of brotherhood.  I can understand that ethics is a very personal choice bet in this case Christian ethics a field of academic study values that life and is more compassionate than the state od Belgium.

&gt;I pity you and the society that spawned you.

You are better than saying tripe like that.

&gt;It is my life, I will live it as I see fit and I will end it as I see fit.

That is valid you can do with you're life as you see fit succeed of fail in life that is up to you please don't go through life blaming others, that is what freedom is.  What is wrong is making other people complicate and accomplices in for all intents and purposes the willful taking of a human life and you sure as hell should not look down on people that value human life.

Well, if the article is anything to go by, because the law would prevent them from doing that. How the law would be enforced is, obviously, a different matter; but assuming it *was* enforced, they wouldn't do it because they wouldn't be allowed to. The strip you linked to is what happens when the whole thing is simply deregulated; the article suggests that the proposal claims to be able to regulate it so that that doesn't happen.

&gt; even in an 'ideal' case where 'normal' lanes retain the same speed and fast lanes get added, the 'normal' lanes are slowed down compared to the speed they would have been without this split, once again they're actually slow lanes.

Right, which is why we need to look at the actual proposal. I mean, yes, you end up with a ""fast"" lane and a ""slow"" lane, but that's sort of the point of the proposal. I mean, when a proposal specifically says that it will allow a two-tier system, it's not a strong argument to say, ""That's not fair! Allowing a two-tier system would allow a two-tier system!"" Supporters of the proposal would say, ""Yes, that's what we're aiming for.""

I am very skeptical about this proposal. But before I make a judgement on this, I'd want to know why it's being proposed in the first place, exactly what it applies to, what it would allow, what it would *not* allow, how it is to be policed, and dozens of other questions aside.

I personally can't see any need for it. But at the moment, all I have to go on is a single, brief article (which may be wildly inaccurate) about some proposal or other.",null,0,null,1435663874,null,0,false,0,csnf8jw,null,t3_3blxaz,null,t1_csnf8jw,null,t1_csnew6i,null,null,null,1437460279,null,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1,null

As far as language is concerned, I'd also recommend ""BILD"", but NOT in terms of journalism. Read Günter Walraffs investigative books to see why... ""BILD"" is not just tabloid press, it's actually worse, I guess.

So my recommendation for online news would be **tagesschau.de**. It's really well-written, clear, and relatively easy language.

The problem with FAZ is, that sometimes (on faz.net not that often actually) it uses a lot of technical terms and all in all, a choice of words that sounds rather intellectual, so you wouldn't speak like that in everyday environment, unless you were surrounded by people who also speak like that.

Sloterdijk for me is one of the most taxing contemporary German writers.

The F16 throughout the years has sort of developed towards the same goal with all its technical updates. The F35 will no doubt outshine the F16 in a myriad of other tasks, although not in this field. It seems weird that a 'fighter' aircraft cannot perform one of those most fundamental tasks, but maybe I am thinking in '70's/'80's tactics. 

To attack my own prevous point that the F35 is too fat and cannot properly dodge missiles: apparantly the newest missiles are so well developed that it could very well be impossible to dodge them as it would require pushing a human well above the normal 9G limit. 

I understand the focus on stealth aircraft but it only seems to make sense in the short to midterm. If that overwhelming advantage at some point gets compensated by superior radar technology, this aircraft will be dead in the water.

You need to understand that debt restructuring and whatever reforms/measures are needed in order for Greece to get back on track are inter-dependent on each other.

The proposed measures should take into account the changes in the debt structure.

Allowing ISPs to reserve some part of general bandwidth for Netflix would have allowed Netflix not to suffer delivery degradation, but increased the service degradation for everyone else.

The key issue in the US is a total lack of competition. Being able to get two choices of internet provider is a luxury. Being able to get two decent choices is like winning the lottery (i.e. one fast cable service and one DSL-based service that isn't stuck in the early 2000s). Therefore net neutrality and regulation are more crucial in order to prevent the monopolists from abusing their positions

That is not quite so true over here (and especially in countries like the UK). I can choose from 20+ ISPs. Any ISP that wants to play games will quickly see themselves losing customers to others. All UK ISPs peer (for free) with the BBC, and the larger ones are happy to peer with Netflix and other content companies too. No drama, no conspiracies over ""throttling"", everything just works.

null,false,yayachiken,NRW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,null,"This probably stems from the use of QoS for low-latency services (like IP telephony) which even some technical people agree to be necessary in a realistical setting. One alternative is large overprovisioning to always have enough bandwidth, even at the largest peak, which is possible but costly. Another would be to provide a guaranteed low-latency low bandwidth line with close to 100% reserved bandwidth on provider side, and a high-bandwidth line with no guarantees. But this is not technically standardized anywhere, so the ecosystem could not really utilize this anyway, but this would be nice for sysadmins or power-users who know what they are doing.

This QoS requirement seems to have been perverted during the legislation deliberations (probably under lobby influence). In a ""Hello McFly, everyone home?"" moment [Merkel argued for a two-tier Internet in life-critical conditions to guarantee 100% reliability.](http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article135028282/Angela-Merkel-kaempft-fuer-das-Zwei-Klassen-Internet.html) Seriously, if you want 100% reliable communication, you must not use a packet switched line, period. It's also a question how you would even implement this. Maybe allow a percentage of packets to be marked as important. But even then, software developers would just mark their traffic as important to improve application responsiveness, and use up all the allowed traffic. And then if my life-critical equipment needs to use the line, it does not have prioritized packets left to do so. Rendering the whole system moot. But maybe Merkel has a better idea, I don't know.

All of this seems to have cumulated in enabling ISPs to offer their own ""managed services"" which can be QoS'd. The legislation probably intends this to be used for IP telephony, etc. but it's clear that Telekom et al. will use this for their own IP-TV, squeezing Netflix, Maxdome etc. out of the market if their delivery works worse than what Telekom offers in-house.

Generally, Telekom has way to much political influence. It's just one of the few ""tech"" companies we have in Germany and is therefore coddled by politics as it appears.

&gt; Also almost every economist I have listen to agrees that the debt is unsustainable right now, and needs restructuring

Different people say different things, it is definitely unsustainable as a % of gdp now, but over the course of 50 years, other countries have paid of a lot more money alot quicker. 

The problem is there is no will to repay, not even now when we just gave you the money a few weeks ago. Greece got a significant relief of 50% in 2008 and 2012 from the private sector. This debt was a political decision, and any relief will be a political decision as well. Like I said, Greece is not the only Democracy in the Union.

&gt;   I don't believe that's the right way to go and neither does the current government.Those ""best european practices"" haven't worked here and that's a fact, like it or not.

Then be honest and say what the alternative is! Greece will not repay the loans. Greece will want further billions to ""invest"", not from the open market, but from other member states. Greece will not make the reforms all other countries have made, and which Greece agreed to make.   

So the EU should ""invest"" further 100s of billions into Greece, and then the situation will get better. But not as new loans, because you do not want new loans. As an EU gift. And then everything will be better and you can start to build institutions that collect taxes.

""Fast-lanes"" in the sense that some providers are treated differently from other providers certainly do. Treating different *services* differently doesn't. Charging different providers differently, and in resonse giving them different treatment, does.

None of these details is actually mentioned in the article. No actual information to go on.

""Cripples"" is a highly emotionally charged word. I'm really tired about the continuing ""you should feel outrage at all bad stuff that is happening"" titles.

This would allow them to deliver traffic to their services via these ""faster lanes"", or in other words, deliver traffic to the contents of their competitors via ""slower lanes"". 

Which falls under ""treating different providers differently"". That is wrong. As you say, the whole point of net neutrality is to prevent this from happening. From the information so far, it's not clear that this is the intention and/or outcome of the proposal.

null,false,kradem,null,null,null,"&gt; 1\. If Croatia has 200,000 administrators employed by the state and no private sector companies or economy to mention, then who do those 200,000 administrators administer?

Croatia's private sector is comparable (let's say that way) to other post-commie countries, only the structure afaic of the ownership for big companies are being different because all of them big private owners are criminals tightly connected with politics (read as: corruption, nepotism, briberies, ...)

&gt; 2\. If you have to be in a political party (HDZ/SDP/HNS...) in order to be employed, by the state, is the current system then communism rather then capitalism?

I don't know its name, but **it is the same unchanged system that has lasted for the seventy years**.

&gt; 3\. If, being a member of the biggest political party (HDZ) requires one to be a 'pure blooded' Croatian, and it is quite certain that the current system of government is basically a form of hybrid socialism - does that make the party (HDZ) a national-socialist party?

Kind of. The problem is that SDP is the movement (not party...) just the same as HDZ. Btw, Serbs in Croatia are minority absolutely equal in political mean for all of those majority conservative liberal center parties of Croatia and just like any other minority (or majority) it isn't condition or obstacle for the highest political positions - all mainstream political parties in Croatia, again, are of conservative liberal centre in orientation.

The main difference in this area is the rised Chetnik movement conducted by Ivo Josipović - those guys are real enemy of Croatian policy and the most dangerous one for Serbs in Croatia minority: Chetniks don't recognize and respect Serbs in Croatia language and their truly antifascist heritage (Serbs in Croatia has been the most antifascist ethnicity of the Europe).

&gt; 4\. Since it is an established fact that there are no jobs in the private sector and also by now, no more vacancies for the state funded positions as well - meaning - no work whatsoever for anyone, and without work there is no money, and without money there is no food on the table hence no family possible, yet the President uses her national TV appearance time to asks Croatians who are emigrating in droves to not emigrate and rather stay at home instead - is the Croatian President then wishing her own people harm by doing so, on purpose, or by an error of judgement?

All of them, all mainstream politicians, are being just the Agrokor's PR. Agrokor is the ex-commie family oligarch Ivica Todorić' company and his business is **completely based on consumption** so, let's face it, he doesn't give a fuck, so they also don't give a fuck.

He's a Master of Puppets having all information and he would do the right moves in the nick of time when those moves would be needed. Right now he's totally secured because he ""invested"" all in Chetnik's Serbia to join EU.

&gt; 5\. If, every Sunday at the church, the priest tells you who to vote for, is the priest then violating the secularity of the state due to an error or via an organized effort of some sort?

Dunno. We have three main ""companies"" on the field: the Central Committee of the Alliance of Croatian Communists (now called HDZ/SDP/HNS-LD), the Catholic Church and Croatian Football Federation.

Imo calling second or third to be HDZ's ally is just *a play* (political agenda populism). 

&gt; 6\. If a political party uses war time anti communist propaganda in order to win votes which seems to be working out well for them, does that mean that the people of Croatia do not fully grasp the fact that we live in the 21st century?

Absolutely. We are truly retards when the subject is politics. The main issue is in the fact that CC-ACC's political agenda for the last seventy years has been to have us as retards here.

 * Love and Tolerance.

 * C'est en faisant ce que l'on a toujours fait que l'on obtient ce que l'on a toujours obtenu.

 * Ça va sans dire, mais c'est mieux en le disant.

 * Celui qui se connait lui même et connait son ennemi sera victorieux pour mille guerres.

 * Qu'est ce qui fait que l'homme est devenu le super prédateur qu'il est aujourd'hui ? Qu'est ce qui nous a fait gagner la guerre des espèces ?

  * La force ? Oui bien sûr : Contre un mammouth de 6 tonnes, un tigre a dents de sabres d'un quintal ou toutes les saloperies venimeuses qui existent. Non.

  * l'astuce ? Non. C'est une caractéristique de notre intelligence, mais la loi de la jungle ne connait aucune faille ni aucune exception. Jusqu'a ce que l'on la rase, la jungle. Et que l'on construise des parkings à la place. Le feu joue un rôle, mais on s'en est sorti sans, jusqu'a le découvrir. On a eu besoin de trouver à manger avant de trouver un bout de baton incandescent par hasard.

  * La compétence sociale ? C'est une bonne piste, mais une quinzaine de bons hommes contre six tonnes de viande, même avec des lances pointues, il se font démonter la gueule bien correctement. Oui en partie, mais c'est pas la clef.

  * La détermination. On est le seul bestiau de tout le putain de règne animal à poursuivre un mammouth pendant des **mois entiers** sur des centaines de kilomètres, sans s'arrêter ou presque, marchant jour et nuit, en se caillant les meules. Les autres prédateurs on jeté l'éponge ou sont morts de déshydratation depuis longtemps. Jusqu'a le coincer fatigué contre une falaise. Terminé. On est pas les plus intelligents, ni les plus forts, ni les plus astucieux. Juste les derniers debout. Condition minimale de victoire.

Il punto centrale dell'articolo, se proprio non si vuole leggerlo tutto (ma lo consiglio perché è molto ben fatto e approfondito), è questo:

&gt; Allora forse la domanda centrale è questa: si può distinguere una persona perbene dai propri atteggiamenti sessisti? Si può dire che Letterman è stato un innovatore e un divulgatore di sottoculture varie mischiate al mainstream e aggiungere che come non si beve o fuma più in ufficio a colazione stile Mad Men, allo stesso modo non si può più passare dieci minuti a flirtare con un’attrice solo per il motivo che altrimenti l’intervista è una noia mortale?

Insomma, assodato che Letterman è un grande, un innovatore, un genio che ha rivoluzionato la tv, possiamo dire che *ad oggi* non è un modello da imitare al 100%? Che quelle robe che faceva erano frutto di una visione anni 50 del rapporto uomo donna e dello showbusiness? Che ora come ora c'è bisogno di modelli più maturi, e una santificazione acritica di letterman (che io peraltro adoro) rischia di far passare come sacrosanti atteggiamenti che tali non erano?

Secondo me è un argomento interessante, anche se non lo si condivide.

Il ribaltamento della responsabilità verso le ospiti mi sembra ingiusto. Devi considerare che luogo di potere è(ra) il Letterman (in grado di lanciare e stroncare carriere), e il ruolo per forza di cose subordinato che ha un ospite in un talk show del genere.

Consiglio, sempre per inquadrare meglio l'aspetto più critico del personaggio Letterman, la lettura di un racconto di David Foster Wallace (My Appearance, mi sembra di ricordare che in italia è nella raccolta ""la ragazza dai capelli strani"").

The educated white people were scared for their safety and moved out of the city. As a result, the automakers followed them since those people were their employees. Tax revenues in the city plummeted, the locals leftover were poor and uneducated so they elected horribly corrupt leaders for decades (most of them are in federal prison now), crime skyrocketed, and so on.

There's been plenty of criticism in the terms of previous deals for many reasons. In particular that the creditors have been much more benefited than Greece, with most capital injected going to their hands as per the terms of the deal. And this is a criticism found even within the IMF itself.

In any case they argue for a different kind of deal as all they see is creditors getting more of their money back (which means as time passes Greece as less and less leverage in negotiations), while Greece's economy and social structure breaks apart.

It's Greece who has lost trust in the creditors. It's not accidental that syriza ended up in power. And considering their position is that previous deals have been destroying Greece, choosing to default becomes a sensible position.

The current 3G and 4G technology is limited by what is both financially possible (how many masts can you cram into an overcongested city) and what is physically possible given mobile spectrum avaliable. Phone providers get a limited amount of radio spectrum in which they can transfer data. Looking at the current rates of internet usage increasing we will face hurdles where the mobile networking infrastructure will become overloaded and these limits will become an issue.

Phone providers try to tackle this by providing smaller data allowances, banning tethering or using throttling/blocks on heavy data users so that other users are not hurt by heavy users. Of course, no one likes this, but not everyone can guzzle unlimited data and still expect good speeds.

The idea that at some point we will need to prioritize data that is actually important over things like YouTube and Netflix video is something we will have to consider, and if mobile roaming is introduced smaller countries with lots of tourism and less advanced mobile infrastructure like Greece will see a sudden surge in mobile data usage - they may be unprepared for this (And where will the phone providers get the money to support this upgrade?)

Another thing to consider is how this would affect data limits, they are there to limit the load on phone masts - if we could prioritise certain data over others then the issue of slow speeds would be reduced as important data would take priority.

Mon grand père a Parkinson. Il était en déni que sa maison il ne l'habitait plus mais il y était attaché. Un jour il avait laissé le chien mourir derrière et avait laissé le corps pourrir et j'ai une tante qui disait cyniquement qu'il était prêt à faire pareil pour lui même. Sa maison était en ruines mais il était toujours persuadé je sais pas pourquoi et pendant des décennies qu'il allait réparer les choses, sans jamais le faire, un hangar plein de machines flambantes neuves et des pièces pleines de hoarding. Un deuxième étage où il n'allait jamais. Se faisant mal au dos une fois il dort pendant des semaines assis au banc de sa cuisine. Un jour il ne lève pas ses pieds correctement il trébuche sur un tapis au sol et termine le bras cassé à l'hôpital. Refuse de demander de l'aide pour manger et ne s'alimente que quand sa femme s'en aperçoit et le nourrit quand elle va le voir.

Sa femme, diabétique depuis toujours. Fumeurs les deux, elle a des problèmes artériels et cardiaques graves. Elle a des problèmes de caillots. Artères bouchées etc. Ne peut déjà pas s'occuper d'elle même.

Ils acceptent enfin un appartement protégé (mais devraient être en établissement médicalisé). Mon grand-père conduit encore pendant un moment, dû à la complaisance des médecins, on ne comprend pas et on a peur pour les enfants de la région et l'autoroute. Depuis, n'a probablement plus de permis mais conduit encore. Sa journée? Sur son fauteuil devant la télé avec le frigo à côté de lui à boire des bières et à somnoler. Ils se font conduire à l'hôpital par des seniors bénévoles de la région, mais eux aussi ils y passent à l'hôpital. Ils ont vue sur la morgue de l'établissement médico-social du complexe. Peuvent demander de se faire livrer des repas mais mon grand-père est un bougre mécontent et il déteste ça. Donc sa femme malade cuisine... et si elle n'est pas là il s'achète de la purée et des saucisses, dieu sait comment. Ses chiottes sont repeintes à la pisse, on engueule la petite si d'aventure elle doit y aller quand on les voit.

Sa femme a un cancer. Elle choisit de traiter. Il faut aller 25 fois faire des radiothérapies et prendre des pilules. Elle ne sait pas combien de temps le traitement peut lui faire gagner. Elle aimerait retrouver une ""vie normale"" après avoir passé pratiquement 1 an à faire des longs séjours à l'hopital après un accident cardiaque, des artères qu'il faut stenter tous les 3 mois parce qu'elles sont bouchées, etc etc, avec la pneumonie et toutes les joyeusetés. Sa vie normale? Bah c'est ça... à vie.

Ils insistent pour venir à ma défense de thèse, avec leurs pampers et tout, mais ça n'est pas possible. Ils veulent aller au resto, une fois qu'il y a déjà une poche d'urine à changer dans l'histoire et que plus personne ne peut vraiment marcher 20 mètres. Les voisins qui les aident leur apportent à domicile la nourriture pour les consoler. Ils sont tellement frustrés de ne pas retrouver la ""vie normale"".

Bref, comme dit mon grand-père, devenir vieux, c'est de la merde! J'ai appris avec soulagement que sa femme a arrêté les traitements pour son cancer. Je pense que c'était trop douloureux pour gagner quoi? 2 mois, 3 mois?

Mon autre grand-mère a donné consigne de ne pas la ressuciter en cas d'accident cardiaque. Je préfère ça.

Sinon mon arrière-grand-mère est morte après quelque temps avec Alzheimer. Ne reconnaît plus personne. Sa maison aussi à l'abandon avec la pisse et l'odeur du chien dont on s'occupe plus.

Cultural differences, I feel, may have been at the root of this last failure. When the Greeks proposed cutting military spending instead of pensions the Germans (and others) seemed upset at this. They viewed it as a negotiating trap. Or perhaps they find it impolite when you are asking for help to propose a means of your own (as in, why are you even asking for help if you think you know best). This took me some time to consider and it might be wrong and irrational. But for me when the Greeks lay defense spending on the line, that seems like a way to signal capitulation. The Greeks spent outrageous amounts on defense but now they spend a bare minimum and obviously people like me and you would rather money go to pensions than guns (forgive the assumption if I am wrong).

But that's not how it works in practice. For example, Apple *could* ban all Google services on iOS and vice versa, to ""push a competitor out of the market"". But they don't. Because in reality there is competition, and if a company suddenly stops providing popular services (or slows them down to make them unusable), then their customers will simply go elsewhere.

On est  d'accord que faut vraiment être borné pour considérer qu'Ariane est merdique. Cela dit, je suis perso un grand fan de SpaceX, pas essentiellement pour leur succès passé et présent, mais pour leur ambition : la colonisation de Mars. Le côté réduction des coûts est pour moi une étape dans le processus, mais sûrement pas le but. J'ai l'impression que peu d'agences spatiales à travers le monde ont conservé cette ambition d'exploration (europe par exemple, mais pas seulement), et ça me rend triste.

&gt; Or Spacex rajoute pleins de trucs dans leurs fusées, du style leur techno de récupération. Du coup je veux dire, qu'ils maitrisent d'abord les bases avant de s'attaquer a plus complexe.

Y a pas de récupération du 2ème étage pour Falcon 9. Mon argument est que si on compare aux stats d'Ariane 5 (le lanceur le plus fiable), Falcon 9 fait aussi bien pour l'instant. Du coup, j'ai envie de dire qu'ils maitrisent les bases plutôt bien, non ?

&gt; Avec mes modestes connaissances en lanceurs spatiaux, il me semble qu'un réservoir de comburant c'est ni plus ni moins qu'une citerne remplie d'O2 quoi...

C'est un peu plus compliqué, c'est un réservoir qui se vide rapidement, et qui contient un liquide qu'on stocke dans un environement plus chaud que sa température d'ébulition. Il faut gérer des variations de pression assez rock'n'roll. Il faut aussi gérer le fait que le liquide se ballade et risque de désarmocer la pompe. Et sûrement un tas d'autres trucs auxquels je ne pense pas.

De plus, on sait que le réservoir a laché, ça veut pas dire que c'est parce que le reservoir était mauvais. Comme l'histoire de la tuyère d'Ariane, c'était une fuite du circuit de refroidissement : si la tuyère est plus refroidie comme prévu, c'est pas étonnant qu'elle se déforme.

Et mon anecdote sur Ariane n'avait pas pour but de montrer qu'ArianeEspace sont des glands, mais de montrer que les fusées sont compliquées, la preuve : *même ArianeEspace* (les meilleurs !) se plantent sur des trucs qui ont l'air basiques, et que du coup, c'est pas justifié de montrer SpaceX du doigt sous prétexte qu'un truc ""basique"" a foiré sur leur fusée.

The current 3G and 4G technology is limited by what is both *financially* possible (how many masts can you cram into an overcongested city) and what is *physically* possible given mobile spectrum avaliable. Phone providers get a limited amount of radio spectrum in which they can transfer data. Looking at the current rates of internet usage increasing we will face hurdles where the mobile networking infrastructure **will** become overloaded and these limits will become an issue.

Phone providers try to tackle this by providing smaller data allowances, banning tethering or using throttling/blocks on heavy data users so that other users are not hurt by heavy users. Of course, no one likes this, but not everyone can guzzle unlimited data and still expect good speeds.

The idea that at some point we will need to prioritize data that is actually important over things like YouTube and Netflix video is something we will **have** to consider, and if mobile roaming is introduced smaller countries with lots of tourism and less advanced mobile infrastructure like Greece will see a sudden surge in mobile data usage - they may be unprepared for this *(And where will the phone providers get the money to support this upgrade?)*

Another thing to consider is how this would affect data limits, they are there to limit the load on phone masts - if we could prioritise certain data over others then the issue of slow speeds would be reduced as important data would take priority.

1. While it is true that Croatia has too much public sector (state employed) employees, it is not true that it has *no* private sector companies. Also, a lot of forreign companies in Croatia need to employ someone. Tourism provides for part of jobs too, and some people are self-employed. So, part of this people administer someone/something and part is politicaly employed.

2. The current system indeed is capitalism, us having problems with nepotism and politicaly provided jobs is another matter. I don't know how a communist state would have market economy and not planned and closed one.

3. Firstly, both SDP and HDZ are equally big parties. Secondly, you *don't have to be ""pure blooded"" Croatian to join it*. It seems to me that you are either trolling or provoking.  The system of government is parliamentary republic. It makes HDZ center-right conservative party with social tendencies. You made a deductive fallacy.

4. Who established that? Give me a source *please*. The whole rant you are going about is utterly stupid. What it seems like is that elected President isn't the one you wished. Though luck. Get over it. The President is probably trying to stop brain drain and keep these people in Croatia to start their own buisnisses. But should she have said that Croatians should emigrate (I don't know which president would do that), you would say that she is a lousy President because she doesn't urge people to stay. Either way you would be unhappy because you just don't like her.

5. I don't know which church you go to, or if you even go at all, but my priest never told me who to vote for. Even if they do talk about politics, they mostly just criticize the govt. Which they can. If they do tell you who to vote for, he is violating the secularity due to an error.

6. Well, communist crimes are not yet punished, almost whole political establishment at the moment was a member of socialist party, and the history is not sorted yet. So you can't expect people to leave it in the past, if the judgement of that time isn't yet delivered by historicians (not by politicians). It takes years and generations for it to go away.

&gt; Today's agreement also enshrines for the first time the principle of net neutrality into EU law: users will be free to access the content of their choice, they will not be unfairly blocked or slowed down anymore, and paid prioritisation will not be allowed. This means, for example, that the access to a start-up's website will not be unfairly slowed down to make the way for bigger companies. No service will be stuck because it does not pay an additional fee to Internet service providers. There won't be gatekeepers to decide what you can and cannot access.
In the open Internet, all traffic will be treated equally, subject to strict and clearly identified public-interest exceptions, such as network security or combating child pornography, and subject to efficient day-to-day network management by Internet service providers.

&gt;In parallel, Internet access providers will still be able to offer specialised services of higher quality, such as Internet TV and new innovative applications, so long as these services are not supplied at the expense of the quality of the open Internet.

I don't worry about this part, this is meant to be used for IP-TV, VOIP (and other real-time) services within the ISP network itself. And it's actually needed to make such services viable at all, and it's something ISPs are already doing.

&gt;The EU will have the strongest and most comprehensive open Internet rules in the world, complete with strong end-user rights to ensure that subscribers get what they pay for. These rules will be a reality across all Member States as soon as the text officially applies on 30 April 2016.

&gt;These common EU-wide Internet rules will avoid fragmentation in the single market, creating legal certainty for businesses and making it easier for them to work across borders.

Telefonica used to throttle Skype's traffic in Spain down back in the day where Skype was brand new. This was done to force people out of VoIP into using phones. Deutsche Telekom, O2, Vodafone, ... did the same. An EU commission estimated that 100 million individuals were affected by this (1, 2, 3, 4).

&gt; Because in reality there is competition, and if a company suddenly stops providing popular services (or slows them down to make them unusable), then their customers will simply go elsewhere.

If all service providers do this in one way or another you cannot go anywhere.

Net neutrality is there to prevent this from happening. They won't do it with existing services, but they will do it with new services. They did it with VoIP (Skype), they did it with internet tv (video streaming), they even tried to do it in Spain with ""internet news sites"" and wanted to charge google an extra to ""compensate"" telecom owned news papers, so yes, they will try to do it with whatever appears next. It is impossible to regulate beforehand what is going to appear next, that is why net neutrality exist, so that we don't have to do that.

Seriously, net neutrality is there to protect the users at the expense of the service providers, and it is extremely simple and effective at that. 

It is understandable that service providers will try to break it every time they have a chance, but doing so in a last minute closed-door EU meeting at late night is an outrage.

LOL

&gt;The cheating is often quite bold. When tax authorities recently surveyed the returns of 150 doctors with offices in the trendy Athens neighborhood of Kolonaki, where Prada and Chanel stores can be found, more than half had claimed an income of less than $40,000. Thirty-four of them claimed less than $13,300, a figure that exempted them from paying any taxes at all.

&gt;Such incomes defy belief, said Ilias Plaskovitis, the general secretary of the Finance Ministry, who has been in charge of revamping the country’s tax laws. “You need more than that to pay your rent in that neighborhood,” he said.

&gt;He said there were only a few thousand citizens in this country of 11 million who last year declared an income of more than $132,000. Yet signs of wealth abound.

ok? See that table? It's an estimate of how many Greeks per sector are fucking with their taxes and by how much....

So taking those numbers as a given, Greece according to World Bank data has around 6 doctors per 1,000 people, so taking 11,000,000 as the population and the 75% and 30K figure they're dodging taxes by I get

1,138,500,000 that's 1.1bn right there and change.

I'm ignoring science and engineering because, well I wouldn't even know how to get that number...

Education, I think I'm wildly underestimating here I'm just going with [world bank data](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/pupil-teacher-ratio-primary-wb-data.html) again...


123,793 primary and secondary teachers, not counting university lecturers and private tutors and etc ok?

24K average at a percentage of 73% evasion...

The numbers are... 2,168,853,360 thats 2.1 bn and change... Seriously. Just from TWO professions/economic sectors I've pulled out a back of a napkin calculation that you could argue against I agree number of THREE FUCKING BILLION OF TAXES BEING DODGED. 

Would the current crisis even exist if Tax remittance levels were even remotely normal?

That study by researchers from the University of Chicago concluded that tax evasion in 2009 by self-employed professionals alone in Greece (accountants, dentists, lawyers, doctors, personal tutors and independent financial advisers) was €28 billion or 31% of the budget deficit that year. €28 billion. €28 billion.

So going from the 2009 numbers, of the €220 billion owed... 28/220 that's 12.7% of the debt. 

At the start of the year with the coming in of Syriza people were quoted as saying ""oh I'm going to stop paying taxes, Syriza will forgive us. They'll understand"" This wasn't business magnates or oligarchs but it was a bloody dentist and she had a tax bill of €20K!!!

I don't think it's a question of indifference, but a question of not really having any feasible plan for what happens after we remove Assad.

Iraq was invaded to remove Saddam, and it ended up in a decade-long civil war, daily bombings, and now finally ISIS. Afganistan was invaded to remove Taliban, and it ended up in a decade-long civil war, bombings, and now finally Taliban is back. Libya was bombed to remove Gaddafi, and now it's in a civil war. We helped factions in Syria against Assad, and some of them ended up becoming ISIS instead. We supported the protests that removed Egypt's military dictatorship, and it ended up in a civil war for a few years until the military took power again.

Even though ""something should be done"" with those dictators... it seems that on average, people were better off under their rule (sucks to be the ethnic/religious group that isn't though).

Encore une fois, pas du tout. Le coeur du business de Google est dans la vente d'espace publicitaire. Ils pourraient revendre pour quelques millions de dollars les données qu'ils accumulent au cours d'une année, mais il vaut mieux pour eux les exploiter pour générer près de 60 milliards de $ par an de revenu, et que leurs concurrents n'aient pas accès à la poule aux oeufs d'or.

Quand je parlais de baisse de prix, je parlais de baisse de prix d'autres produits.

Ca n'empêche pas qu'ils te lâchent un navigateur web performant gratos, des serveurs DNS gratos, des CDN gratos, et qu'ils parlent pour toi dans chaque comité technique qui se réfère au web. Tout ça, gratos.

Why is pro neutrality the ""right"" side and not having neutrality ""wrong"".

Again, the US needs it because of their lack of competition. In the EU it is much more possible to have an internet that is effectively neutral, without needing to create a law to force it - because we have adequate competition to stop ISPs from messing things up

&gt; The FCC's ruling on Net Neutrality proves that net neutrality is the future and a necessary one. 

In the US, yes - though I'd rather the FCC followed the position of the rest of the world by allowing ISP competition to prosper through forcing their telcos and cable companies to let third parties use their network

&gt;  People have the right to use 5 or more video streaming services. I use Netflix, Canal+ and BBC iPlayer via VPN and I don't see why one ISP has to tie with one streaming service.

That is more to do with content rights and how content companies want to run their business. Nothing to do with net neutrality - having net neutrality will not suddenly make the BBC give free access to iPlayer to anyone in the EU or across the world.

Where it would make a difference (if it was necessary in the first place) is that a UK ISP couldn't force the BBC to pay for premium access to an ISP's network and thus their customers, nor could it allow them to throttle the BBC because they didn't want to pay. In the UK at least, this has never happened and is not likely to.

&gt; And domestically the concept of fast-lane internet is unconstitutional according to French law, since it breaches our freedom of choice as freedom of expression guaranteed by The Constitution of the Fifth Republic.

C'entra nel momento in cui non è che si sia tirato esattamente indietro rispetto a questa oggettivazione della donna. Guarda [questo montaggio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHNQwOz8BaI) che viene linkato nell'articolo, mi sembra abbastanza significativo.

Sul resto sono d'accordo, ma il punto dell'articolo è cercare di sottolineare la parte sessista del personaggio Letterman, sforzandosi di far capire che il suo valore come uomo di tv e il suo modello di interazione con le donne siano due cose che possono essere scorporate, e che si può confermare la prima e deprecare la seconda.

Considerato che il sessismo non è una cosa che è relegata al passato, l'evoluzione verso una nuova mentalità non è compiuta, in quel senso, tutt'altro.

null,false,eugay,null,null,null,"&gt;The new EU net neutrality rules guarantee the open Internet and enable the provision of specialised or innovative services on condition that they do not harm the open Internet access.These are services like **IPTV, high-definition videoconferencing** or healthcare services like telesurgery. They use the Internet protocol and the same access network but require a significant improvement in quality or the possibility to guarantee some technical requirements to their end-users that **cannot be ensured in the best-effort open Internet**. The possibility to provide innovative services with enhanced quality of service is crucial for European start-ups and will boost online innovation in Europe. However, **such services must not be a sold as substitute for the open Internet access, they come on top of it**.

They are lying through their teeth. Look. YouTube is one of the biggest users of internet traffic, if not THE biggest. As its usage grows, you would expect the companies to invest in the infrastructure to keep up.

Having specialized services in place, ISPs can say ""fuck it"" and not expand their capacity for video. Soon their internet peering bandwidth is not enough, so while email works, streaming videos gets choppy. What a shame, obviously the ""best effort internet"" is not enough.

Here comes the great solution, specialized services! For $X, we can guarantee you flawless streaming. No user will be ""hindered"", as there was no blocking or throttling, it's actually an enhancement ""on top of"" the ""best effort internet"".

La décision d'achat du F-35 ""sur plan"" y a été prise par une entourloupe. Les militaires n'étaient pas chauds, acheter un avion qui n'existe pas encore était un gros pari.

How do you let a company get such horrible results, yet it's still not your fault?

It's a normal practice for big infrastructure systems: let a company make the debt, so only the yearly subsidy to the company comes on the books, used to pay off the debt.

Could you write the above post in German and understand the replies without needing a dictionary? Yes or no? If the answer to that is no, you won't survive two weeks at a German university. It is one thing to do well in German class in US highschool, it is a totally different thing to follow lectures on a university level in German. You'll probably need an intensive language course (usually 6-12 months) before you can start.  

&gt;Everywhere I read online said the same thing, to obtain a student visa, one must be able to 'financially support oneself'(Around $10,000 per year...) .

That is true. If you did not have this money, you'd quickly become a burden on German society. The rules for a student visa are set in place to prevent that from happening. 

You need to have the first 10k in the bank, the other money can come monthly from your parents. You need around 600-800 EUR per month, depending upon where you study, what kind of rent you pay and how frugal you are. 

&gt;As I stated earlier my family is nowhere near rich, and I sincerely doubt that American loan companies are eager to give money to someone to move thousands of miles away.

I knew a guy from the USA where his parents had taken out a loan to finance his studies in Germany. I think he even got some sort of government support.

He also worked 60 hours each week in two jobs and saved close to 20k over the course of several years before he finally decided to board a plane to Germany.  As a result his parents only had to borrow around 10k for his education.  

&gt;I am unaware if financial aid is available for foreigners looking to study in Germany,

There are some decent options for grad students. But for undergrad students the options are really limited. 

The German system for student-support is tax- funded and only available to those who have previously contributed to the German tax and social security system. This excludes you. 

Your only hope are the highly-sought after, very limited scholarships that are available to students with good grades in their third and fourth year of studies.

Well, first of all, the verb of the sentence is 'He aprendido', which is in preterito perfecto compuesto/antepresente of 'Aprender'. 'Hablar' here, which is in infinitive, is what we in Spanish call [Complemento/Objeto Directo](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objeto_directo), and it's necessarily required by the (in this case) [Transitive Verb](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitividad_(gram%C3%A1tica) 'Aprender' to give it its full, precise meaning. I'm not entirely sure, but I think it's the same difference between 'I've learned Spanish' and 'I've learned to speak Spanish'

&gt; Spain origin - - well, she was from Barcelona, I dunno if that makes a difference to you

Everything else I've said in my other reply, but I want to comment on this. It doesn't bother me, and it usually doesn't bother most of the people you'll interact with. And there's not really a way to avoid this if they feel the need to be picky: if you refer to their nationality by their province, you'll piss off one group; if you refer to them as Spanish, you'll piss off the other one. The best you can do is to always be precise, say things like 'They are Spanish, Catalonian/Basque/Galician to be precise', and even then you will sometimes find the one asshole enough to say 'Then they aren't Spanish'. Believe me, I've seen it.

Polish lyrics with my back-translation:

&amp;nbsp;

O, radości, iskro bogów,

Kwiecie Elizejskich pól,

Święta, na twym świętym progu

Staje nasz natchniony chór.

Jasność twoja wszystko zaćmi,

Złączy, co rozdzielił los,

Wszyscy ludzie będą braćmi

Tam, gdzie twój przemówi głos.

&amp;nbsp;

O, joy, spark of gods,

Flower of Elysium fields,

Holy, on your holy doorstep

Stands our inspired choir.

Your brightness will darken everything,

Will join what was divided by fate,

All people will be brothers,

Where your voice will sound.

&amp;nbsp;

[Optional, not sung in videos above:

&amp;nbsp;

Patrz, patrz, wielkie słońce światem

Biegnie sypiąc złote skry,

Jak zwycięzca i bohater

Biegnij bracie tak i ty.

Radość tryska z piersi Ziemi,

Radość pije cały świat,

Dziś wchodzimy, wstępujemy,

Na radości złoty ślad

&amp;nbsp;

Look, look, great sun, through world,

Runs sprinkling golden sparks,

Like the victor and hero,

Run brother, you as well.

Joy squirts from breasts of Earth,

Joy is drunk by whole world,

Today we enter, we join,

The golden trail of joy.

&amp;nbsp;

]

&amp;nbsp;

Ona w sercu, w zbożu, w śpiewie,

Ona w splocie ludzkich rąk,

Z niej najlichszy robak czerpie,

W niej największy nieba krąg.

Wstańcie, ludzie, wstańcie wszędzie,

Ja nowinę niosę wam:

Na gwiaździstym firmamencie

Bliska radość błyszczy nam. 

&amp;nbsp;

She is in the heart, in the wheat, in the song,

She is in the weave of human hands,

The pettiest worm drinks from her,

In her the greatest circle of heavens is.

Stand up, people, stand up everywhere,

I have news for thee:

On the starry firmament

A close joy sparks for us.

null,false,hebinesh,null,null,null,"&gt; What should we do? Reduce corporate taxes and subsidize foreign investment?

The problem is that there have been severe cuts for six years. Public amenities in the health, social, education and transport sectors have been slashed severely. This is the problem, not the issue of needing deep reforms and continuing to pay back the debt. Greece has been paying back the debt and has made severe cuts. The only problem now is that while they are paying it back and working on dismantling the clientele state, there can not be a continuing disinvestment in social services. That's just not sustainable and leads to conflicts by the masses which we have now. You have to support social services in tough restructuring times just as you would do in Germany. That is really the only reason for all this. 

You ask where would the money come from? Where is the money coming from now to pay back the debt? It's called rescue package for a reason and some of the money needs to be redirected to bolster social spending, that is all. In the end, I blame the Greek governments who have badly negotiated this as much as I blame the lenders. 

As an outsider, it seems to me that past Greek governments maybe just went along with the lenders before Syriza and now Syriza of course swings into the other extreme and completely blocks negotiations. 

As someone who lives off of negotiations in business, I would suspect that maybe Greek politicians or politicians in general just don't know how to negotiate properly? Who knows, all I know is a bit more of the ""rescue"" money needs to be re-directed to direct social services and the LAST thing that should be done is pensions to be cut. The people who spend the most are lower income people, such as pensioners who live off of that money. The money to support the actual economy has to come from SOMEWHERE. If no one can spend any money and everyone saves, even on food, how can you expect any business to be done?

First of all: 21.15 is absolutely not too late to **have dinner** in restaurants, in fact people usually dinner at 20.30 or later, especially in good restaurants where it is active a ""double eating turn"". Anyway please don't dinner at touristy places all around central touristic zones, enjoy very good ones: tripadvisor is your friend.

I recommend you to have dinner here 'cause we italians are good in a couple of things, and food in one of those.

Once put step out of train, I would for sure direct myself toward **trastevere area**, packed of good places to eat first and to **drink** something after that in nice pubs. I would take the ""H"" bus in the bus terminal in front of the station, making tickets beforehand; it's easy, you get off first stop past the Tiber river. (have a watch of the Isola Tiberina passing by the bridge, on the left). then go to the right in those little walkable streets on the right, find your restaurant.

for tips check http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/wiki/lazio

Second, **monuments** are very beautiful at night, fascinating, though closed, as museums too. Walking by night in the citycentre, through all the hotspots, is something that will probably take hours, well spended indeed. 

I've made an [itinery](http://imgur.com/BGDpgEa) map to see a lot of things in a looong walk, but worth it. points are freewalking. hope it is easy readable. also don't panic if you cant's follow it on-site. suggest to download and carry it on phone.

Arrived to **Piazza di Spagna** square, go up the steps, and finally turn left, go upward till there's this place called ""**Pincio**"" belvedere, directly up the square to have a look at the **ethernal city from above, at dawn, at 05:45 AM**. From there you can simply step down the hill and take the MetroA (Piazza del Popolo) directed to Stazione Termini.

2. [Der Spiegel](https://spiegel.de/) (Germany).

3. [NZZ - Neue Zürcher Zeitung](https://nzz.ch/) (Switzerland).

-------------

Your fears concerning **NZZ** are unfounded, in my opinion. It is written in Standard German of Swiss variety! The occasional Helveticism and no ""ß"", that is all. A current issue you might find - for example - is ""die Ausschaffung"" and ""ausschaffen"" instead of ""die Abschiebung"" and ""abschieben"" (deportation). Or generally: a swiss ""federal state"" is called a Kanton (canton), not a ""Bundesland"" like in Austria and Germany.

--------------

**Der Standard** is a center-left Austrian newspaper and my favourite. It's the same with this one as with NZZ: the occasional Austriacism, maybe an idiom / word here and there you're not familiar with from ""Federal"" Standard German! ""Marille"" instead of ""Aprikose"" (apricot), for example. Or the names of political bodies / positions: for example Bundesland (federal state) is the same, but the governor of a Bundesland is called ""Ministerpräsident"" in Germany, but ""Landeshauptmann"" in Austria.

-------------

Quite generally I would advise you read some articles and texts from each - Austria, Germany and Switzerland - regularly. German is a pluricentric language and you'll get a way better ""feel"" for it this way! It is also interesting to see how different the cultures of those three countries can be!

Catalonia has been the industrialized zone of Spain with Basque Country and Madrid. It is one of the richest (maybe the richest, can't remember right now) parts of Spain. 

That said there are differences and you can tell were some people are just by looking at them. If I am at Berlin for example I can tell who's Spanish and even tell the autonomous region just by looking, of course this is not 100% and has some selection bias but still. Spain's dictatorship tried to homogenize Spanish culture, but we have very different cultures and languages. Someone from canary islands is very different than someone from Extremadura that is very different from someone from Santander. We share a lot but you can definitely tell the differences. 

For example and being a bit exaggerated, woman in her 40's with short hair dyed in a strange color and color glasses is Catalan 80% of the time. [Young guy with a mad max hair cut, mountain boots and those trousers with a different fabric color on the knees is basque](http://telecincostatic-a.akamaihd.net/t5cinema/cine_2014/ocho_apellidos_vascos/Antxon-demuestra-apellidos-vascos_MDSVID20140421_0060_17.jpg) or maybe navarre or la rioja.

You also have to take into consideration that Catalonia is a region that took a lot of immigrants from other parts of Spain, specially Extremadura and Andalucia, you have a very mixed population. Madrid is the same and Basque country also had a lot of emigration. 

At least in my experience I haven't experienced great differences in character, maybe there is a trend in nationalistic people, they are a bit assholish, but that is my experience with every nationalism, not just Catalan, think of it as vegans.

What they'd do though is make them stable and sustainable. Once all the extra costs are cut down, the country can grow again (and, indeed, it started to slightly redress itself before Syriza came to power).

You can't have it both ways. You can't prop up an economy through a bubble and then complain and blame everybody else when the bubble bursts. 

Greece loaned money for years way above what it could realistically repay (they had 340 bil. euros worth of debt before the economic crisis started). Most of that debt has already been restructured, the problem is that Greece spends much more money than it makes because it keeps propping up businesses (like the OSE) that would have failed many, many years ago (if they were privately-owned), as well as for a slew of other reasons. I'm not saying that their reasons or wrong or judging their ethics in any way, I'm just talking from an economic point of view.

There are also many older, educated individuals who feel similarly. I obviously can't give you exact population numbers or percentages but among the people I know there is a very strong sentiment and a disgust as to the state we have been in. I think most of the people who feel like this genuinely want to be the change they desire and they act as such, they are fair and hard-working people and feel despair about the inability of our governments to do better. However, there are also those that do need to be forced because they have benefited from the various parties. They have made things exceptionally difficult for those of us who have wanted things to be different. You're certainly not wrong, but I wouldn't say that there is no will from the population to change or to strive for better things. 

That being said, I have lived abroad in the UK (I'm half British) for many years and whilst corruption and dirty games cannot necessarily be seen on the surface, my experience is that corruption and injustice exist here too but they are hidden much better and perhaps don't seep into the daily lives of the general public to such an extent. Honestly, as much as I feel anger about the state of Greece, I have felt equally angry about the state of politics and government in the UK for example. I don't believe Greece is alone in being politically dirty or stupid but that's just my impression based on my own experiences.

Like Netflix deciding that traditional peering norms aren't for them (network operators that peer freely usually do it because there's some mutual exchange of traffic - Netflix's traffic is inherently very one sided and according to any publicly available peering agreement, Netflix would be expected to pay) or their refusal to use multiple transit companies (they used Cogent, a company known for its history of peering disputes, and wondered why Cogent couldn't deal with their load).

Direct peering between content company and ISP is technically the best solution, whether it's paid or settlement-free. But that would constitute a ""fast lane"" (I hate this term).

Comcast are not blameless of course, but neither are Netflix. Both sides were in war and holding their customers hostage in the process. Comcast may be accused of refusing to upgrade network links to Cogent so that Netflix looks bad, but Netflix could be accused of being happy with this and not using alternative means at its disposal to get around it, as it makes excellent anti-big-ISP PR. They also moan about ""extortion"", but depending on what they are paying companies like Cogent to handle their traffic for them, paying the ISP directly may have been a better deal. 

To use the horrible fast lane and road analogies, it's like Netflix deliberately sends their traffic down a road they know is congested, rather than using all of the other roads to the same city, because they think it will mean that the city will build a new highway to their depot at no cost to Netflix",null,0,null,1435672527,null,0,1435673583,0,csniljx,null,t3_3blxaf,null,t1_csniljx,null,t1_csnewxe,null,null,null,1437462487,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

The Eurozone only provided support when it became clear that the markets would break half of the eurozone states. By then a lot of damage was already done. They also insisted to fund that operation with taxpayer money instead of using the ECB, *even though the ECB had to inject liquidity into the economy to stave off inflation, so inflation risk was below zero*. So the only reason taxpayers have funded it is because the Eurozone leadership wanted it to be that way.

&gt;The monetary union was founded to be a growth and exchange promoting framework 

So they're continue to impose austerity that reduced economic activity in Greece with 30%? That makes no sense.

null,false,Toppo,FINL,Finland,null,"The referendum in the family does not change your rent or supply cost, but it is something you have agreed to give weight to and respect more than decisions made just by the head of the family. You have agreed to it and based you business on the principle of valuing and respecting referendums, also within families, so the family should have a stronger bargaining chip if the entire family decides to haggle, instead of just the head of the family making the decision. If you don't give any more weight to the fact one family makes the decision to haggle together, your claimed respect for collective decision making in the families loses it's worth and it is revealed that you don't really respect the values you have claimed to respect.

So you either stay true to your words that you respect and value and give weight the family making decisions together, or you admit that all that talk about giving respect, value and more weight to collective decisions was just phony talk.

So the referendum is a strong bargaining chip because the Lisbon Treaty, the fundamental basis for the EU states in the very beginning:

&gt;**The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights [...] These values are common to the Member States**

and:

&gt;**Every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union. Decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen.**

Now, if the EU does not give any more weight to the fact that the Greek government decides to make the decision more democratically openly and closer to the citizens via national referendum (instead of just having the government of Greece decide) then it shows that the EU does not respect the democratic rights, dignity and freedom of EU citizens of a member state as it claims. So either EU has to admit it doesn't value and respect democracy as much as it claims to value and respect it (a blow to the reputation of the EU), or then Greece has a strong bargaining chip.

Namely, that all debt above 60% (the Maastricht threshold) should be passed to the european central bank (since most countries were essentially able to get the loans by using the brand name of ""EU"" on their foreheads). This threshold would be 90% for nations with higher burden (Greece, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, etc)

Now, the interest rate would be still paid by the debtor countries but of course at a lower common rate, and refinancing it would be much easier.

Nope. It is relevant as it helps understand why the US went down the path it did.

&gt; Net neutrality is nothing more than the idea that a delivery company shouldn't charge both ends of the service for delivery. That if one user has paid for a delivery the company shouldn't also be able to double dip with the other end user.

I know what net neutrality is, thanks - though the idea that only one side pays is rather incorrect. Netflix will be paying regardless of the existance net neutrality or not - they have to pay transit companies to get to networks that they don't peer with directly, for example.

The idea of net neutrality is often compared to the telephone network, where telcos don't tell you who you can talk to, or what you can talk about. The people who make these comparisons fail to remember that both sides pay for their connection into that network, though, and a company that needs to make more concurrent calls has to pay more for additional lines.

&gt;  Number of ISPs doesn't come into it. 

It does for the key reason that competition tends to moderate behaviour.

&gt; You can have network neutrality with a monopoly.

I think you're just blathering on without actually reading or understanding my original comment at this point.

&gt;  The ISP only affects the final stretch of the network. The ISP will still have to contend with every subsequent stretch of the network potentially being squatted by a double dipping corporation trying to charge both ends before they deliver.

The ""double dipping"" tends to be practiced by the ISPs - e.g. Comcast/Verizon.

My argument was that in cases when not all information is instantly available(like when you meet a stranger) making certain assumptions leads to a higher chance of making the decision leading to the most favorable outcome to you. In other words making assumptions is beneficial to the individual(which is why people evolved to do it) therefore it's rational.

If I understand correctly, your argument is that in cases when making an assumption can lead to the unfair treatment of someone, that automatically turns that assumption irrational. With this I disagree. If being unfair has a statistically higher chance of granting you the most beneficial outcome then being unfair is rational.

For example if a man in a suit collapses on the street, people will be more likely to help him, than a person dressed as a bum who collapsed in the same way. Horrible double standard, right? But at the same time homeless usually have much worse personal hygiene than people in suits, therefore they are more likely to give you some disease or parasite. They are also more likely to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, therefore they can be more prone to spontaneous aggression. In other words, helping a homeless person is more dangerous than helping a man in a suit.

Just have a national committee come up with a monthly list of issues for the public to vote on and call it a day.

On the other hand, if you agree with the idea of a representative democracy, then Tsipras and company should make the call since they were entrusted by the people to be the experts and to carrying the responsibility.  If they arent up to the job, hold new elections.

The historical city centre is nice to walk around and _should_ be _almost_ car free. You can visit there the ""Duomo"" (cathedral), see the iconic 'Liotru' (an old sicilian word for Elephant) which is the symbol of the city and walk up ""via etna"" until reach the city park ""Villa bellini"". Arrived there don't miss the opportunity to try an ""Arancino"" in one of the two bar in from of the park entrance (Savia or Spinella). I **strongly** suggest you to try the one with pistachio :)
Go around the villa, enjoy an ice cream, don't forget to eat a ""Granita"" and you have more time you can also visit the fish market.

&gt; Would you suggest a small beach on the East side ? (or wherever).

I come from a small village in the east side. In this part of sicily you can find different types of coasts.
Around Catania : it's ""normal"" sand.

Between Catania and Riposto, the coast is mostly with rocks. If you like diving/snorkeling there should be a reserve around Aci Castello. If you go there pay a visit to Aci Trezza and its ""Faraglioni"".

From Riposto to Giardini, you can find gravel beaches with different nature. One of the most famous is the one between Fondachello (Mascali) and Marina di Cottone(Fiumefreddo)

Personally I prefer last one :)

&gt; Moscow. June 30th. INTERFAX.RU - Russian Prosecutor General's office began checking the legality of recognition of the independence of the Baltic republics by the State Council of the USSR in 1991, ""Interfax"" on Tuesday, a source familiar with the situation.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Legally, the decision to recognize the independence of the Baltic States is defective due to the fact that it takes an unconstitutional body,"" - said the agency interlocutor corresponding parliamentary inquiry into the main supervisory authority.
&gt; 
&gt; In his opinion, the answer to the appeal ""would be the same request to the Crimea."" Source Agency said that Prosecutor General's Office has recognized the illegal decision on the transfer of Crimea in 1954 of the RSFSR in the Ukraine, but, according to him, this decision has no real legal consequences.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Prosecutor General's Office only stated a fact, namely, that the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine in the days of Nikita Khrushchev did not occur on a constitutional basis, since the relevant decisions are not taken by the competent authorities"", - said the agency.
&gt; 
&gt; According to him, ""in the present circumstances and realities that no authoritative body that could reverse this decision."" ""Although such a need has not. Crimea is again a part of Russia, and the question went to the political plane,"" - said the source.

&gt;

Well, as long as there are no national referendums in other euro zone countries about the issue, there are no other referendums to be heard than the Greek one. If there would be 18 other referendums on what Greece should do, then of course it would be a very strong bargain chip for the Commission. But there isn't, so now the referendum is a bargaining chip for Greece.

&gt;The answer is though public opinion in all countries is Greece should accept the reforms or leave.

The issue also being that there is no legal way to expel Greece from Euro without the consent of Greece, and there is no way to expel Greece from EU without the consent of Greece. So even though other countries would say ""do what we want or get out of EU and euro"", it isn't legally possible without the consent of Greece.

So the only way to get Greece out of euro is for troika to artificially make the life of Greece so difficult within euro zone that Greece has no other option than to ask for Grexit. This in my opinion is kind of like blackmailing, something which I see strongly against the values of the EU expressed in the Lisbon Treaty and The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.

What I also see as ridiculous that partly the troika is also responsible for the shit in Greece, and at the same time EU is now thinking of giving unconditional humanitarian aid to Greece in case of worst case scenario.

&gt; Certainly not. Let's abstract the issue: would you find it normal if the US signed a deal with Germany that required the CDU to campaign in a certain way?

Ok, I'll humour you. As far as we've heard no one is demanding Syriza to campaign one way, only Tsipras. So, if Merkel were to sign an agreement with Washington, I would expect her to campaign in favour of that agreement.

&gt; Zudem finde ich es im Zuge der Berichterstattung der ""seriösen"" Medien geradezu lächerlich das DWN einen Conspiracy Blog zu nennen. Was in Zeit, Spiegel und Co. zu Griechenland abgeliefert wurde unterschritt zuweilen noch das Niveau von DWN. 

Nein tut es nicht. Allerdings kann ich mir schon gut vorstellen, dass das in deinem Kopf so aussieht. Das kommt durch RT.

A mere fluctuation in growth rates means nothing. They're still in a 30% hole.

&gt;, the decisions taken by the Greek government since then have been disastrous.

They haven't had time to implement policy, it was negotiating and dealing with threats right from the start... a situation that was engineered by their predecessor who intentionally shortened the period Greece had right to funding and manipulated the election timing so the new government would have to negotiate at the worst possible moment. Syriza wasn't allowed to implement ""unilateral"" actions by the Trojka, they never got a chance.

Do they think the pensions and salaries will magically grow with a magnitudes larger hole in their budget and no way to cover it?

Also, does nobody stop and think for a minute and consider that it might be infeasible to further help Greece in any form, if a solution is not reached immediately? All the money given under current programmes was loaned under very optimistic assumptions that Greece will quickly recover economically and will be able to repay at least a significant part of the loans and it is becoming more and more apparent that that will be very hard to achieve. I mean, we are discussing a massive third bailout, combined with hundreds of billions that were spent to prop up the Greek banks, while the plan was to have 1 and then be done with it. 
What if Greek banks collapse, Greek state runs out of funds completely and capital controls become so extreme that they suffocate the last remains of functioning Greek businesses, dropping the Greek GDP for another 10, 20% in a short period of time before a new deal is reached.

&gt;Unlike stricter rules in the US, the EU will allow specialised services for things such as streaming live TV **as long as it does not hinder other users customers**, in a move likely to be welcomed by telecoms groups.

I'm pretty sure the targeted throttling of services like Skype and YouTube matches that description. So again, I don't quite get the outrage over this alleged 'crippling' of net neutrality.

And the reason for my general skepticism is that in a well developed market with a decent amount of competition, you wouldn't even need to enforce net neutrality to prevent customers from getting screwed over – and companies could still 'violate' net neutrality in cases where it makes sense for their customers.

So I think the best approach would be not to use the sledgehammer and reduce all service providers' flexibility with tight regulation, but to increase the amount of competition wherever it's currently lacking.

Year 2008

Banks: Governments save us! We speculated too hard and now we are going to drag you down with us.

Governments: Fine... Don't let that happen again.

Year 2010 

Banks: Governments we speculated too much on Greece and they're threatening default. Save us pls!

Governments: Dang! How to sell that to our voters. *putting on EU mask*

EU: Okay Greece, here's your money. Pay our banks now pls. 

Greece: No we don't need money! We are in deep trouble! The banks need to take a haircut on their debt!

EU: No way! You can do this! Just follow these instructions *hands IMF pamphlet*

Greece: What? 5.5% interest when you borrowed that for 3%? Fine...

Year 2012

Greece: Guys! We are still in deep trouble! Your instructions didn't work, your interest rates are eating all the savings!

EU: Well you should've saved harder! Anyway, banks you need to take a haircut now.

How is a referendum any different than an democratic chosen government? especially this one, since this one was chosen to handle the crisis

the referendum means nothing because one party (the rest of europe) doesn't get to vote. 

&gt;So you either stay true to your words that you respect and value and give weight the family making decisions together

of course we respect it, if they don't want the deal, they don't get it. that doesn't mean that not giving them a better deal is 'not showing respect'

&gt;The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights [...] These values are common to the Member States

Are you trolling me? not giving greece a better deal has nothing to any of this. 

&gt;Every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union. Decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen.

so the rest of the EU gets a vote as well?

&gt;if the EU does not give any more weight

EU already has given maximum weight to Greece; Greece has a veto; they can do whatever they want. We've reached a helping hand, Greece on it's own can choose whether to take it or not. 

&gt;Now, if the EU does not give any more weight to the fact that the Greek government decides to make the decision more democratically openly and closer to the citizens via national referendum (instead of just having the government of Greece decide) then it shows that the EU does not respect the democratic rights, dignity and freedom of EU citizens of a member state as it claims.

of course we respect that, we don't care how you do it. take the hand or not, but your not entitled to a better deal just because the answer comes from a referendum. 

&gt;So either EU has to admit it doesn't value and respect democracy as much as it claims to value and respect it (a blow to the reputation of the EU), or then Greece has a strong bargaining chip.

neither; we fully respect Greece to decide however they like, for what i care they can roll a dice for it. but you don't get a better deal just because you did it democratically 

finally; one county voting isn't democracy on EU level. An EU vote is  is democracy on EU level.

null,false,The_Wohlstandskind,GERM,Germany,null,"From the official [European Commission - Fact Sheet](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-5275_en.htm)**Net Neutrality****Why do we need rules for net neutrality?**Net neutrality is crucial for users and businesses. It ensures that Europeans have access to the online content and services they wish without any discrimination or interference (like blocking or slowing down) by Internet access providers. This is also very important for start-up businesses that commercialise their products and services via the Internet and need to be able to compete on an equal footing with larger players.Until now, there have been no clear rules on net neutrality at EU level, leaving most Europeans without legal protection for their right to access the open Internet. Some EU countries have adopted national laws on net neutrality. However, in a Digital Single Market, we cannot afford that 28 Member States adopt 28 different approaches on that issue. The freedom of European citizens to access or distribute Internet content must not depend on the country in which they are. Having an EU law on net neutrality will avoid further fragmentation of telecoms regulation in Europe.**What has been agreed?**The rules enshrine the principle of net neutrality into EU law: no blocking or throttling of online content, applications and services. It means that there will be truly common EU-wide Internet rules, contributing to a single market and reversing current fragmentation.Every European must be able to have access to the open Internet and all content and service providers must be able to provide their services via a high-quality open Internet.All traffic will be treated equally. This means, for example, that there can be no paid prioritisation of traffic in the Internet access service. At the same time, equal treatment allows reasonable day-to-day traffic management according to justified technical requirements, and which must be independent of the origin or destination of the traffic.**How does this agreement balance out the interests of industry and consumers?**The agreed rules establish a right of all Internet end-users (consumers and businesses) to access and distribute legal content, services and applications of their choice. The agreement allows efficient network management by Internet service providers, subject to clear and strict rules. This means that consumers will have no obstacles to access any online services and applications over their Internet access, now and in the future, when faster Internet access and new applications will be available.The rules also enable continued network and service innovation by defining the principles underpinning the relationship between Internet access services and innovative services with specific quality requirements. The rules will ensure that the quality of the open Internet access service will not be hampered by the provision of services such as IPTV or telemedicine which share the same infrastructure. These innovative services may only be offered where and if sufficient capacity for Internet access remains available.**Will there be paid prioritisation services in the open Internet?**Under today's agreement, paid prioritisation in the open Internet will be banned. Based on this new legislation, all content and application providers will have guaranteed access to end-users in the open Internet. This access should not be dependent on the will or particular commercial interest of Internet service providers. These providers will not be able to block or throttle traffic in their networks or give priority to some particular content or services in exchange of payment. At the same time, end-users and providers of Internet access will continue being able to agree on different access speeds and data volumes as they do today.**What are the exceptions in the open Internet for traffic management?**The rules will prohibit any blocking, throttling, degradation or discrimination of Internet traffic by Internet service providers. This general prohibition is subject to a limited number of tightly defined exceptions:- to comply with Union or national legislation related to the lawfulness of content or with criminal law, or with measures implementing this legislation such as a decision by public authorities or a court order, for instance if a judge or the police have ordered blocking of specific illegal content;- to preserve the security and integrity of the network, for instance to prevent misuse of a network and combat viruses, malware or denial of services attacks;- to minimise network congestion that is temporary or exceptional. This means that operators cannot invoke this exception if their network is frequently congested due to under-investment and capacity scarcity;- to filter spam, if users want to avoid such unsolicited communications, as well as to allow parents to set up parental filters that block pornography or gratuitous violence, with the prior request or consent of end-users and the possibility to withdraw the consent, and thus such filters, at any time.**What are specialised services (innovative services or services other than Internet access services)?**The new EU net neutrality rules guarantee the open Internet and enable the provision of specialised or innovative services on condition that they do not harm the open Internet access.These are services like IPTV, high-definition videoconferencing or healthcare services like telesurgery. They use the Internet protocol and the same access network but require a significant improvement in quality or the possibility to guarantee some technical requirements to their end-users that cannot be ensured in the best-effort open Internet. The possibility to provide innovative services with enhanced quality of service is crucial for European start-ups and will boost online innovation in Europe. However, such services must not be a sold as substitute for the open Internet access, they come on top of it.**By allowing the provision of innovative services, are we not promoting a two-tier Internet?**No. Every European must be able to have access to the open Internet and all content and service providers will be able to provide their services via a high-quality open Internet. But more and more innovative services require a certain transmission quality in order to work properly, such as telemedicine or automated driving. These and other services that can emerge in the future can be developed as long as they do not harm the availability and the quality of the open Internet.Therefore it is important to have future proof rules which, while fully safeguarding the open Internet, allow market operators to provide services with specific quality requirements in order to provide them in safe manner. It is not a question of fast lanes and slow lanes - as paid prioritisation is not allowed, but of making sure that all needs are served, that all opportunities can be seized and that no one is forced to pay for a service that is not needed.**What is zero rating?**Zero rating, also called sponsored connectivity, is a commercial practice used by some providers of Internet access, especially mobile operators, not to count the data volume of particular applications or services against the user's limited monthly data volume.Zero rating does not block competing content and can promote a wider variety of offers for price-sensitive users, give them interesting deals, and encourage them to use digital services. But we have to make sure that commercial practices benefit users and do not in practice lead to situations where end-users' choice is significantly reduced. Regulatory authorities will therefore have to monitor and ensure compliance with the rules.**What is the role of national regulatory authorities?**National regulatory authorities shall monitor and enforce the open Internet rules. These authorities will thus have the power and obligation to examine the traffic management practices of Internet service providers and the effect of their commercial practices on the end-users' (consumers and businesses) rights to access and distribute content, applications and services of their choice. They will further have to ensure that the quality of the open Internet access service reflects advances in technology and that it is not degraded by traffic discrimination through Internet service providers or by the provision of specialised or innovative services.Regulators are also empowered to set minimum quality of service requirements on Internet access providers and other appropriate and necessary measures to ensure that all end-users enjoy an open Internet access service of good quality.**What will happen if a service provider will not respect open Internet rules?**The regulation will oblige Member States to set rules on the penalties applicable to infringements of the net neutrality provisions.

&gt;Mais toute personne qui a fréquenté un peu les forums de discussion sur Internet sait qu’il n’en est rien. Tout le monde campe sur ses positions. Mais pourquoi donc ?

&gt;Prenons l’exemple du passionné de musique qui est convaincu que le piratage nuit aux artistes. Le convaincre que ce n’est pas le cas et que le piratage n’est pas immoral revient, selon son propre point de vue, à admettre qu’il était assez bête pour avoir le cerveau lavé par l’industrie du disque et que tout l’argent qu’il a dépensé en CDs est un gaspillage total.

C'est depuis 1941 que la politique étrangère australienne colle à celle des USA, quand la Grande-Bretagne a été incapable de les défendre.

Le F-35 est un cheval de Troie des USA pour détruire l'industrie aéronautique européenne. Une chercheuse de la Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique a écrit des papiers dessus : Helène Masson.

Bcp de pays européens ont rejoint le programme F-35 parce que les USA leur ont promis des contreparties sur leur territoire mais elles n'arriveront jamais. Je crois que le Danemark, le Royaume-Uni et les Pays-Bas ont commandé le F-35.

Les USA avaient déjà fait le même coup avec le F-16 dans les années 80 qui avait raflé le ""contrat du siècle"" en Europe au nez et à la barbe du Mirage F-1.

Après il ne faut pas oublier les erreurs françaises : Michèle Alliot Marie voulait brader le *Rafale* à ses amis arabes (Maroc) alors que Dassault aurait perdu de l'argent sur le contrat et que Bercy et la COFACE avaient déjà accordé bcp de prêts au Royaume chérifien.

Parfois il vaut mieux renoncer à un contrat où on perd de l'argent.

Balladur/Sarkozy de 1993 à 1995 ont été spécialiste des contrats à pertes : sous-marins vendus au Pakistan, frégates Sawari 2 (dont l'une s'est échouée sur un récif) vendues à l'Arabie Saoudite. Parce qu'ils profitaient des contrats pour récupérer des rétro-commissions pour financer la campagne présidentielle de 1995.

Le contrat des chars Leclerc vendus aux Emirats a été lourdement déficitaire à cause de leur re-motorisation Mercedes je crois. Je ne sais pas si c'est GIAT/Nexter ou l'Etat qui a épongé les pertes. l'Etat en dernier lieu je suppose.

Il faudrait étudier certaines défaites françaises :

* échec de la vente du Rafale à la Corée du Sud (mais la Corée dépend des USA pour sa défense)

* échec de la vente du Rafale à Singapour (mais l'influence de la France en Asie du Sud-est = 0)

* échec de la vente du Rafale au Brésil. les USA ont du se marrer quand Sarkozy a annoncé le contrat avec Lula.

Dieses Gerangel um eine Definition des Begriffes *Stolz* dauert gefühlt schon ewig an.

Ich bin kein Freund englischer Worte und Redewendungen in deutschem Fließtext. Zu diesem Thema bietet sich allerdings der Gebrauch des Englischen an, um die Situation in knappen Worten so zu beschreiben, wie sie sich darstellt:

They take pride in being proud.

Das zeigt eine Wechselwirkung an, womöglich auch eine spiralförmige Entwicklung.

Stolz ist eine besondere Form der Liebe, eine gesteigerte Form. Wer stolz ist erweist Ehre; im Gegenzug erfährt er oder sie auch Ehre.

Bin ich beispielsweise stolz auf meinen Sohn, honoriere ich seine herausragende Bedeutung. Ebenso fühle ich mich geehrt, mit solch einer herausragenden Persönlichkeit bekannt zu sein und Umgang pflegen zu dürfen.

Ist Stolz im Spiel, wird auf förmlicher Ebene Ehre ausgetauscht, zum Nutzen beider Parteien.

Die Liebe hat dies nicht zu bieten. Die Liebe kann heimlich sein, sie kann auch langfristig unerfüllt bestehen. Die Liebe ist eine Erwartung, eine Hoffnung, eine Verheißung; und sie kann auch erlöschen. 

Aus diesen Gründen kann den Nationalisten die reine Vaterlandsliebe nicht genug sein. Eine sprachliche Unterscheidung war sinnvoll. 

Stolz zur Bürgerpflicht zu erheben, ist seit jeher ein kluger Schachzug der Extremisten. Denn Stolz bedingt zwangsläufig eine viel engere Bindung, eben aufgrund dieser beschriebenen Wechselwirkung.

Wer häufig genug vom Nationalstolz hört und liest, glaubt daran und findet schließlich auch ausreichend Beispiele, wie ihr oder ihm von Seiten des Vaterlandes Ehre zuteil wird. Somit ist Nationalstolz eine Vaterlandsliebe - aber mit garantierter Gewinnausschüttung; eine Vaterlandsliebe_plus, sozusagen.",null,0,null,1435675894,null,0,false,0,csnkhia,null,t3_3bmmh5,null,t1_csnkhia,null,t3_3bmmh5,null,null,null,1437463782,null,-2,false,de,t5_22i0,-2,null

1)E' difficile immaginare che la truffa sui bilanci orchestrata da Goldman Sachs non fosse nota ai vertici finanziari europei, basta dire che dal gennaio 2002 il responsabile delle operazioni europee di tale banca era un certo Mario Draghi. Ciò ovviamente non toglie che i governi che misero la grecia in tale situazione furono dei maiali. 

2)Nella storia del debito di un paese un default conclamato 3 anni fa andrebbe almeno citato. Marzo 2012, il debito in mano ai privati è stato ristrutturato mentre gli istituzionali non hanno voluto mollare un euro. Già allora si sapeva che il debito non era sostenibile, avrebbero potuto evitare tutte le ricadute europee che hanno portato al qe rinunciando allora ad una manciata di miliardi e sistemare davvero la faccenda. 

3)Intato le istituzioni (fmi, bce, organismi della ue) che hanno prestato i soldi alla grecia hanno fatto fior di utili su tali soldi, con gli interessi e comprando debito sul mercato dei bond a prezzi bassissimi nei periodi di panico (comprando magari a 30 un titolo per cui la grecia dovrebbe restituire 100). Buona parte di tali utili non sono stati utilizzati per aiutare la grecia. 

4)Nel mentre Francia e Germania, come gesto di solidarietà, imposero la condizione che l'acquisto di navi militari e altre forniture per miliardi di euro da loro aziende non venisse bloccato. 

5)Nel 2014 le cose sembravano migliorare, la grecia aveva in proiezione il miglior avanzo primario al mondo praticamente (http://knoema.com/OECDEO95/oecd-economic-outlook-no-95-may-2014?tsId=1008190). Se avessero deciso prima il qe anziché rompere le balle a draghi per un anno prima di dare il via libera si sarebbe potuto forse fare il miracolo di tornare sui mercati e rollare il debito senza ulteriori prestiti (almeno fino a quanto durerà la stagione dei bassi tassi di interesse). 

6)la faccenda dopo la vittoria di syriza è diventata colpirne uno per educarne 100: accettare di aiutare la grecia voleva dire favorire podemos, nonché front national, m5s, etc., e tale preoccupazione è diventata la priorità per l'ue",null,1,null,1435676219,null,0,1435676493,0,csnkopo,null,t3_3bms5n,null,t1_csnkopo,null,t3_3bms5n,null,null,null,1437463886,null,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5,null
