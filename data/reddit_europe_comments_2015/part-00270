Beside that you are right: comparing Berlin to Paris, London, Rom or Madrid you will notice how cheap Berlin is (just compare the real estate prices of Berlin with London or Paris; those are two different worlds). 

I think one reason is that the cold war isolated the city and made it not very attractive for wealthy westerners to move there. There were times where the US air force had to drop food and supply by air because the sovjets put a blocade on the city. In the meantime London and Paris were international metropols.

Next Germany is dezentralized. The only really important thing Berlin has is our federal government and many political organs. Its not our economical power house neither (trades are done in Frankfurt, industry is mostly in the south and NRW, habour is in Hamburg). Even in terms of culture you can debate if Berlin is really that important, many media companies are not located there and other cities have really big music and art scences. Now look at France for example. France is fucked without Paris, same goes for London. Those are the former capitals of their empires.

Apart from the fact that using higher education to push a particular political aim being utterly inappropriate and that isn't what it does, I don't quite see why it would being more integration 'than fifty EU summits ever could'. I mean, looking at the stats for Erasmus it doesn't seem to reach a huge number of people, which is a shame, because it looks like a great opportunity. From the UK side, its seems fairly on a par with people travelling to Australia, Canada and the US. And finally, I'm sure it dilutely helps foster good relationships between people in different European countries, but I'm not sure it would encourage anyone to want more unification..

Se ti interessa approfondire la cosa ti consiglio di leggere [questo](http://www.ibs.it/code/9788871805399/pipes-daniel/lato-oscuro-della.html) che è un po' pesantuccio ma che spiega la cosa molto bene (soprattutto, ti fa capire che almeno a livello di mentalità il tuo prof non si è inventato niente)

Expelling blacks from Mcdonald's: local boss investigates his own restaurant in Budapest, Hungary

Black visitors were expelled from the Mcdonald's on the Blaha Lujza square in Budapest after they finished their meal, allegedly because they were considered drug dealers. The restaurant chain is investigating the case, but the outcome of the investigation may depend on what the local business leader says about the case. This is not the first embarassing incident at that fast food restaurant.

The black visitors of the Mcdonald's were only allowed to sit at their table for a few minutes as a security guard expelled them from the restaurant. One of them was just allowed to finished his meal.

Only blacks - The rigor applies only to blacks, Asian and white guests are not harassed by local security guards - reported the Blikk about the incident happened over the weekend, they also provided a video about the incidentl. The store manager, according to the newspaper argued, that the rigor is necessary as the restaurant has become a favorite meeting place for drug dealers, and the restaurant wants to protect their clients. The tabloid also wrote that the workers supposed to recognize the drug dealers by the help of a photographic list.

Just among us? - We asked the McDonald's Hungary, their spokeperson Sylvia Adam told us that ""in their restaurants no one distinguished on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, citizenship status, disability or sexual orientation. About the case in question, McDonald's has ordered an internal investigation in the mentioned fast-food restaurant. We understand that the manager, who will investigate the case is the same person who spoke about the scandalous incident with the press earlier.

Only if necessary - We contacted the police: the Budapest Police has no information about harassment of any non-white guests in the restaurant or about the drug dealers there. This is probably remain the same as the McDonald's lead an internal log abouit the conflicts in the restaurant, but they contact with the authorities only if necessary.

Someone hit - In April, for example, they turned to the police, when they beat up a young man - in the same fast-food restaurant at the Blaha square. According to the victim, who spoke to 444.hu, a local security guard assaulted him and punched him several times in the face, cutting his mouth as well.

No procedure - The official version of the McDonald's is completely different, they told us that two company fought in the restaurant, and then assaulted one of the employees of the security service as well. Internal investigations have shown that this time the guards acted lawfully and professionally. It is interesting that although the company portal and the victim also spoke of ill-treatment, the police did not initiate any proceedings against anyone.

Allowed to breastfeed? - McDonald's security personel sometimes lose it when they see a nursing mother. As we reported, on May 20 on the Western Railway Station, a fast food restaurant security staff said to a pregnant woman that ""breastfeeding activity is not accepted here"". In response, two days later , hundreds of nursing mothers surprised the fast food restaurants, a network spokesman appeared in no time on the scene and tried to reassure everyone that ""this is a family- and child-friendly company.""",null,0,null,1436984928,null,0,false,0,ct4f779,null,t3_3dernc,null,t1_ct4f779,null,t3_3dernc,null,null,null,1437877514,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

As soon as you feel even moderately ready, find some native speakers and chat with them. I use the app HelloTalk to do this since I prefer chatting with people using my phone, but there are also desktop services out there, like SharedTalk. By hitting up a dozen or so native speakers, you can practise introducing yourself and asking/answering simple questions. Notice how your conversation partners ask and answer questions and learn from them.

Each conversation with a native speaker is going to start out like ""Hey, how are you?"" ""I'm good, you?"" ""Me too, thanks. So where are you from? What's it like there?"" etc. etc. After having had enough conversations of this kind, you will feel comfortable with basic German and then be able to branch out your conversations.

Up until reunification West Berlin attracted many new citizens (the government also incentivized this). But East Germany hadn't really much to offer. When reunification happend, East Berlin had a lot of unused space. Many houses could be fixed up with little effort. This led to pretty big surge in supply, while demand had yet to pick up.

Alexis Tsipras will complete this Wednesday his third marathon in 5 days. After approval of the reform propositions by the Greek parliament the last Saturday at 4AM, the 17 hour negotiations in Brussels with the heads of State of the Eurozone between Sunday and Monday, the different commissions of the Parliament will analyse the reforms between 10AM and 6PM. Alexis Tsipras must then meet the heads of the parties before the start of the plenary session, which is predicted to happen at midnight.

Weakened inside his own party Syriza, where there tens of dissenting MPs, the Greek Prime Minister must also come to terms with recalcitrant ministers who haven't voted in favour of these measures, but who also refuse to quit the government of their leader. Syriza is on the edge of implosion. But even in the case of a rejection of these reforms by a good part of his MPs, the new austerity measures imposed by Brussels will probably be approved through the support of the opposition.

No elections predicted at this moment

In an interview that lasted more than an hour, Alexis Tsipras talked about the process of negotiations. Above all, he has admitted the difficulty of defending this deal before the MPs. « In this moment, I take full responsibility for my mistakes and my errors of judgement, he has confessed. I take the responsibility of signing this document in which I do not believe in, but which I am obliged to make work. I will not escape from my responsibilities. This time, what is important is to ensure that the country and the working class evade an enormous catastrophe, a financial disaster, that the banking system does not collapse and that the citizens do not lose their savings, that the country is not abandoned and left ungovernable. »

But what will happen to this government? In Athens, there are many MPs who think that Alexis Tsipras will reshuffle his ministerial cabinet since this Thursday, by excluding de facto those who will not vote in favour of these reforms. But for the moment, the Greek Prime Minister excludes early elections: « I want to make it so that the choice I made with a knife under my throat be put in work. I don't have any reason to desire elections, he explained in his interview. Everything will depend on what happens these coming days, inside his party as well as outside it. When all these adventures end, notably the deal with the creditors, we will see if there is a social majority or not. »

312 billion euros to pay back

If everything goes as planned, only then will Greece be able to start negotiations to obtain a third bailout plan with more than 80 billion euros to get the country back on its feet and pay back the creditors. Athens has a lot of payments to make in the weeks to come. After the first evidented default in 30 June to IMF, Greece has repeated its behaviour. It has failed to pay back to IMF 450 million Euros due this Monday.

The country lives at the moment thanks to the financial support of the ECB which is holding back its emergency loans to the Greek banks. The country is also heavily indebted to the ECB. In 20 July, Athens must pay back to the ECB 3,5 billion euros, then 3,4 billion euros at the end of the year and 6,5 billion euros in 2016. The bill continues until 2054. Including the loans from IMF and ECB, Greece has a total debt of 312 billion euros to other countries of the Eurozone and other creditors. A total amount which represents approximately 180 % of its GDP.

■ The government employees angry, the first strike for Tsipras

Even if the call for strike launched by the public sector unions does not mobilize the majority of government employees, because a good part of them are in vacations, like the school teachers, this strike will be the first to which Alexis Tsipras is confronted. The government employees denounce the austerity measures negotiated this weekend in Brussels.

Nikoforos Konstandinou, member of DAKE, one of the main teacher unions, reckons that his profession has suffered a lot under the measures passed by the preceding governments. « Even though we don't know yet in detail all the measures in the deal, we know that there will be lowering of salaries, of pensions, a raise of taxes and an increase in retirement age in 2022 to 67 years of age. Additionally, we will not replace those who will depart. In short, these measures will totally change our conditions of work », he reckons.

Even if this deal doesn't predict a raise of work time which was already increased in the second bailout plan, these new measures, according to him, will make a number of teachers go to the private sector. He understands the effort required from his country, but does not support that which is asked for his profession. The unions will assemble just before the Parliament, while the latter looks into the austerity measures.",null,0,null,1436985221,null,0,1436985732,0,ct4fed3,null,t3_3de60l,null,t1_ct4fed3,null,t1_ct4augq,null,null,null,1437877668,null,28,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,28,null

Deswegen habe ich ja gesagt, dass im Gegensatz zu Zigaretten bei Alkohol insbesondere vor dem verantwortungslosen Trinken (eben wegen der Überdosierungsgefahr) gewarnt wird.

&gt;Und so eine kaputte Leber ist auch nicht grade toll zum alt werden.

Natürlich ist Leberzirrhose schlimm und viele Menschen sterben daran. Aber i.d.R. entsteht diese durch Alkoholmissbrauch und nicht durch gemäßigten Alkoholkonsum. Im Gegensatz steigen die Chancen auf Lungenkrebs auch beim normalen Zigarettenkonsum stetig. (Ein Leben ohne Alkohol ist natürlich dennoch eher gesünder.)

Mein Punkt ist nicht, dass Alkohol harmloser ist als Zigaretten/Tabak (oder umgekehrt). Mein Punkt ist, dass beim Alkohol nicht die Inhaltsstoffe für die meisten Probleme sorgen, sondern übertriebener Konsum/Missbrauch, da dieser gesundheitsschädigend ist und der entstehende Rausch gefährlich sein kann.

Bei Zigaretten wird i.d.R. halt bereits vor den Risiken des normalen Konsums gewarnt (s. bspw. eine Zigarettenpackung), da allein der regelmäßige Konsum gesundheitsschädigend ist.

The insane prices on a lot of things also makes the whole thing worse, since Norway doesn't stand a chance when it comes to competing in most fields.. And it absolutely makes sure that tourism isn't going to be the saving industry for the future.

The Munich area is indeed famous for Weißbier (and you can visit e.g. the brewery in Erding). The area surrounding Bamberg, on the other hand, has the highest density of breweries in the world, although they specialise in other kinds of beer. Bamberg in particular is famous for its smoked beer (it's like marmite - love it or hate it). [There's some more info on ""Beer Franconia"" here.

Check the documents on the websites of the banks you are interested in, as they may differ - some banks have stuffier lists. 
I opened my account with ING - I really like the way they handle things, they are easy to get in touch with and solve your problems quickly. 
Besides your passport, you will surely need the residency documents (NIE &amp; maybe Certificado de empadronamiento) and filling in some forms. If you are moving to Spain for work and will have your paycheck delivered to this account, it will be a lot easier to open and you don't need to deposit any money at the beginning. Otherwise, many banks require (or at least required when I went through this 3 years ago) a pretty hefty initial deposit - fyi I just checked and the ""no salary"" ING account needs a min. 600 euros deposit in order to activate, so not so terrible.
Now about the English talking aspect - it's pretty much a ""fingers-crossed"" type of a situation - when you contact them, just ask for somebody that speaks English. There's a higher possibility of getting somebody like that in the less traditional banking institutions - that's why I would recommend ING. However, if you have a friend or colleague to help you with this in the beginning, it will be a lot easier.
Any questions, I'm be happy to help!

Is this still true between the US and Spain considering the dual citizenship agreement?

Enlistment was mandatory until around 15 years ago, so all of my male relatives have been through the military. And based on what I have heard, I can't imagine why anyone would leave California to join the military in Spain. Your economic and social mobility is severely limited in Spain.

I love my country (ok, countries) and if you want to join las fuerzas armadas españolas that is fine with me. But I think you are making a rash decision. You are in your early 20s, right? I think everyone at some point has that ""exodus"" moment. For me, it was after my gf of 10 years broke up with me at age 24. I started to pine for California, even applied to jobs out there and started looking for apartments. I live in NY so this would be a major, life-altering move for me.

Until a friend told me something that stuck with me to this day: ""Wherever you go, there you are."" I was running away from my problems and running away from my identity which I hated... It would have been the wrong decision to move to California at that time and I'm glad I didn't. With time, and some effort, I managed to get my life back on track. I know things must seem really ""up in the air"" right now what with not being able to finish college. But I promise it always looks worse when you're in the thick of it. Think about everything carefully before you decide, because this decision in particular could have some severe consequences if you lose your citizenship.

I also promise the USA looks a lot more appealing as soon as you move somewhere else. The grass is always greener on the other side.

In a normal currency area, all the banks have accounts with the central bank. Transfer money from your account to mine and your bank will transfer money from its account with the central bank to my bank's account with the central bank.

In the Eurozone banks (which might be a subsidiary) operate only within one country and have accounts with the national central bank. The national central banks have accounts in turn with the ECB. Transfer from a Greek bank to a German one and the money is debited from the Greek bank's account with the Greek central bank, also debited from the Greek central bank's account with the ECB, credited to the Bundesbank's account and also credited to the German bank's account.

This segregation of banking means that Greek banks can be cut off from the Euro in a way that a Yorkshire can't be cut off from the pound. If a Greek could walk down the road and open an account with a German bank - a real German bank with an account and borrowing facilities with the Bundesbank or with the ECB itself, not a Greek subsidiary of a German bank that's firewalled off by regulations - then selectively cutting off Greece from the Euro wouldn't be nearly as easy.

It also means that all the national central banks have balances with the ECB, and those balance sort-of represent money created by that country and used to claim some of the output of other countries without that country having reciprocated. ie, a bit like a loan and a trade deficit.

That sounds like an interesting idea, but what about the unemployed? Most social benefits go to the unemployed (if I'm not horribly mistaken) to keep them from having to live in a card box and eat of a dumpster. Would you go for the ""fuck them"" or is some welfare state ok?

&gt; My point was that Health care costs are increasing, because there are no incentives to make it more efficient.

Yes, technically a market is an incentive. Maybe I'm channeling my inner stereotypical German too much here, but for me I'd see efficiency as reason all on it's own. But I can also see a Minister of Health proudly walking into a press conference and announcing that the rates will be lower next year because they streamlined some process - though I do doubt I'd ever see it.

&gt; Why we do not shift to digital learning is beyond me... Harvard, Stanford and MIT do it.

Because Harvard, Stanford and MIT are filthy rich. The problem is that you can't just say ""Ok, everybody get your laptops from home!"" Because some people simply don't have that kind of money, so now you have to give people that equipment for free from the state because otherwise their kids would have a disadvantage.

As a left-winger my solution would be a wee bit more radical: 1. Found a state-owned publication house. 2. Hire expert writers, designers and pedagogue. 3. State writes its own books under the editorial scrutiny of all major parties and the public. 4. Print the book and offer a digital version online for free. 5. Sell the books to schools so that you just break even. 6. Watch as slowly less students will take the books and just come in with electronics on which the books would be.

The reasons are many, but first you will be familiar with the program and the episodes, so you will already know the context, making it easier to learn new vocabulary. Second, the voice actors who dub the shows in French typically speak more slowly and enunciate more clearly than the actors on French shows. They also use slightly less slang, although they do use quite a bit (which is a good thing to learn, but it takes time and is easier if not thrown at you all at once). There is a site that has a ton of dubbed shows and movies: http://full-stream.me/ but be aware that it is loaded with pop-ups, so have your ad blocker installed.

For books, again I'd say go with a book you know well and find it translated into French. For example, my favorite book is *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, and I find that very easy to read in French because I know the English version so well.

If I recall correctly (and I'm not an expert, but there's been discussion about it before), (a) there's only liability if you make more than a certain amount and (b) income taxes paid to the country that you are earning the money in come first, and you only pay the difference between the two if you paid less than the US tax rate, so it's mostly-interesting if you're moving to a tax haven.

Also, as long as you have citizenship, you *do* have the option of collecting from Social Security and having embassy services (which are interesting because there's a big military backing them), so you are getting at least some benefit, even if you're not currently living in the US.  In the event of trouble overseas, the US has a long history of evacuating US nationals, and if need be (e.g. China, IIRC Ottoman Empire...) sending in military forces to extract them.

You *also*, in some cases, are liable for taxes even *after* giving up your citizenship -- some people have said ""Oh, I'm about to sell off my stock from a massive IPO of a US business I founded.  [I'll just drop my US citizenship and go somewhere else and then sell off a couple hundred millions or billions of dollars in stock and then live there.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Saverin)""  The US will still hit you up for taxes in at least some of these cases.

Now, maybe you should argue that those shouldn't happen, but a lot if it is structured so that someone doesn't make a huge amount of money in the US and then have an enormous incentive to promptly emigrate before that income is recognized, or for someone to work abroad without paying for social services, but then return and take advantage of them.

&gt;The EU’s statistics arm, Eurostat, has approved the deficit numbers from the Hellenic Statistical Authority, known as Elstat, which has been under Mr. Georgiou’s leadership since late 2010. In previous years, the EU body often expressed reservations about the accuracy of Greek fiscal data.

Where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may grant, under certain conditions, Union financial assistance to the Member State concerned. The President of the Council shall inform the European Parliament of the decision taken.

null,false,emptyheady,NETH,"The Netherlands ",null,"&gt;That sounds like an interesting idea, but what about the unemployed? Most social benefits go to the unemployed (if I'm not horribly mistaken) to keep them from having to live in a card box and eat of a dumpster. Would you go for the ""fuck them"" or is some welfare state ok?

Huh? basic income idea is that everybody is basically guaranteed an income, regardless whether you are employed or not. No one is fucked as far as I consider. 

With the technological advancement, I tend not to shame nor blame people for being unemployed. 

&gt;Maybe I'm channeling my inner stereotypical German too much here, but for me I'd see efficiency as reason all on it's own. 

I am almost done studying Industrial Engineering and business management. Efficiency has been the main subject in my study. I am almost a German -- according to Duolingo, I speak 17% fluently German. 

&gt;But I can also see a Minister of Health proudly walking into a press conference and announcing that the rates will be lower next year because they streamlined some process - though I do doubt I'd ever see it.

In the UK (the NHS) applies some kind of controlled competition. I think that would be the optimal. Ideally, we would like to live in a world where we just basically don't need health care -- i.e. preventative policies ought to be looked at. 

&gt;Because Harvard, Stanford and MIT are filthy rich.

I believe that all of them are privatised. 

&gt;As a left-winger my solution would be a wee bit more radical: 1. Found a state-owned publication house. 2. Hire expert writers, designers and pedagogue. 3. State writes its own books under the editorial scrutiny of all major parties and the public. 4. Print the book and offer a digital version online for free. 5. Sell the books to schools so that you just break even. 6. Watch as slowly less students will take the books and just come in with electronics on which the books would be.

You know, maybe that could work for efficiency. But I go to a business and engineering school. The freshmen already get significant different curricula. The school has to move with the job market and demand of businesses, and that moves really quickly. But perhaps that is different for more static academic subjects, like physics? 

&gt;It appears there's no connection at all, except that if you treat men somewhat equally

Maybe -- personally I would not take parental leave anyway. If it makes little to no difference, I prefer no maternity leave nor paternity leave. In my view: every policy is more bureaucracy, less freedom and less efficiency. 

&gt;That chart doesn't support your argument though

Maybe. It was about the question why American women did better than Swedish women (in the interview). Economists have been speculating, but no concrete study has been done. 

But the basic idea is far from controversial, parents care about their children -- and that parental love overshadows money incentives.  ",null,0,null,1436989677,null,0,false,0,ct4ifag,null,t3_3dbwe3,null,t1_ct4ifag,null,t1_ct4giuu,null,null,null,1437879130,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

you need DMarks to buy German products and since you guys don't like printing money there is only a certain amount to go around. supply and demand now kicks in

&gt;Germany would benefit more in regard to say italy no matter how cheap the euro is in the scenario you describe simply because the production is better.

I know and that's what it's bad for everyone else. lets just say hypothetically speaking every other country apart from Germany leaves the euro, Because Germany exports more than it imports there is going to be more demand for euro's to buy those exports than there are euros in existence and the value of EUR will naturally increase. 

(That's the supply and demand part)

Now Italians and French will find German products un-affordable thanks to how expensive the Euro is compared to their currency's but their own exports will become more competitive in comparison (because less people want the not so efficiently made product) 

There is a balancing effect which currency's bring, currency that is in demand like the swiss frank are strong and give a lot of purchasing power but hurt exports, weak currency's like the rouble is currently make imports more expensive but this has the side effect of helping local business to become more competitive compared to expensive imports.

In the past German efficiency and exports has been held back by how strong the DMark was, now it has no such problem and other countries don't have the lever available to make their own cheaper either.

Ideologies like Thatcherism and the current European austerity are incredibly divisive. Some people might love it, but others certainly don't. Thatcherism is what killed the Conservative party in Scotland, and its effects are still around today. 

The EU would disenfranchise a LOT of people if it unilaterally decided to form a federal government and drag everyone into it.

Every eurozone country should have a referendum before it can be further integrated. This isn't something that politicians should be signing away in backroom deals. It needs actual consent from the populace. 

The non-eurozone countries can stay out of it. Those that want to further integrate are welcome to join the euro.

Aus dem Freundeskreis kenne ich auch viele Geschichten zum Druck sich zu betrinken auf Feiern. Ich mied sowas eher, auch gerade weil nüchtern unter Trunkenen langfristig nicht spaßig ist. Wenn ich dann mal mitgegangen bin, wurde recht schnell versucht mir auch Alkohol anzubieten. Es war nicht böswillig, aber es wurde schon klar gemacht, dass es schöner wäre ich würde mittrinken.

I'm not sure about it, to be honest. I agree that a simple inflation-adjusted comparison of the two amounts is basically spurious, but not that the ratio of global GDP is any kind of appropriate adjustment factor, and I'm not sure that GDP growth is sufficiently independent of inflation for you to multiply the two figures without a risk of squaring some shared element. 

I've done a fair bit of trying to find out what x amount of wealth at year y means in current terms (for games programming, usually), and that sort of simplistic comparison is almost invariably misleading (as is, of course, the original comparison you're arguing against).

It's actually very visible that Finland is a Nordic country - the cities are well developed, infrastructure is excellent, people are calm and there are no decaying buildings (something you can't avoid in Estonia). Not to mention the wealth and wages (1000€ in Estonia vs 3200€ in Finland).

Then there's the cultural side. If Estonians need to group themselves to one set of countries, they often want to choose Nordics. That's because of cold weather, history of Danish-Swedish occupations and influences and the feel of 'brotherhood' with Finns (due to language relations). Baltics? Well, yeah, similar history, somewhat overlapping influences, similar economies, but then again, Balts are not our relatives.

Noridics, especially Finland (due to proximity and similar language), are the most popular emigration destination of Estonians. In my opinion, it's only logical that we try to make our country similar to that where our people leave.

Also, Sweden and Finland are more important business partners to Estonia than Latvia and Lithuania.

Leeheim is correct. O dear, that's small. Your best bet would be to make use of public transport to get to Darmstadt. There's a university there, and thus, there's also some young people. All the activities you mentioned can easily be exercised there (if you mean ""visit a football stadium"" by ""catching a few sporting events"", then you can also go to Frankfurt).

Ecoute, c'est pas ma faute si tu n'y connais rien. A ton avis pourquoi y'a des minorités Chinois partout en Asie du Sud-Est ? Pourquoi l'armée des Indes comportait beaucoup de Sikhs ? Oui pour un pouvoir colonial c'est super pratique des minorités dans les colonies parce qu'on peut s'appuyer sur elles pour administrer contre la majorité.

Napoléon III en effet était en effet plus pro-arabe. Mais dans tout les cas pour obtenir la citoyenneté Française il fallait la demander, et un arabe pouvait toujours se brosser. En plus c'est compréhensible de vouloir garder ses traditions au lieu de devenir un paria chez le colonisateur.

&gt;Ben oui, et ? Le fait de n'envoyer que 50 000 hommes (et je dis bien hommes) fait bien partie d'un mode de colonisation différent que celui d'envoyer des millions de familles entières.

Sauf que c'est pas une politique volontaire. La Couronne aurait bien aimé envoyer plus de monde, mais elle n'a pas réussi là ou les Anglais avaient la masse de minorités religieuses qui avaient le droit d'aller en Amérique. C'est complètement différent certes, mais a cause de ce nombré réduit . 

Ensuite oui, je te conseille de te renseigner sur la différence colonie de peuplement/colonie comptoir. La France en avait des colonies de peuplement. Moins que les Anglais pour des raisons climatiques . En Algérie les indigènes étaient complètement exclus du pouvoir et leur terre furent confisquées, comme dans les colonies anglais, il n'y a pas de différence. Les Anglais avaient aussi des colonies sans peuplement, il n'y a qu'a voir l'Inde qui était dirigée par une petite minorité de quelques dizaines de milliers de Blancs. 

C'est une différence entre colonies, pas entre nations.


Ah et le principe de la caricature c'est de faire de la propagande. C'est pas surprenant que dans une caricature allemande en pleine Weltpolitik on te montre des colonies allemandes ordonnées et le bordel partout ailleurs, parce que l'Allemagne veut entrer dans le jeu colonial. Et ton interprétation actuelle à peu de valeur, à l'époque il s'agissait bien de jeter de la boue sur les Français.

I understood that Greece was running a budget deficit of about 10 - 12% a year right up to crisis, and as a result, had to, for the first time run a balance budget. Its primary surplus is small (as compared to Portugal and Spain) and most of the bailout money goes towards paying back previous loans (but yes, they are running a surplus as they do not have any more bailout money)
So my question is, without gov deficit spending, is what we are seeing in Greece the ""natural"" state of the country?
How would Greece stabilize and grow without massive gov spending? Even if Greece was given debt relief of say 30%, would that extra gov revenue 1% of GDP help the country get back to where it was before the crisis?

The changing of salaries was supposed to be an exception that Varoufakis tried to use to make the salaries a bit more fair (he wanted to apply a 40% decrease, same as all other public employees). In his opinion, the fact that even the one thing he was supposed to have control of was rejected by the troika is telling about the troika's intentions when they say they want to turn these institutions independent.

I thought the bailout agreement includes ""consulting"" about executive decisions as well. I must admit I am not an expert on the Greek government system. Care to enlighten me?

&gt; This consulting with the EU refers to draft legislation, not legislation passed by the Greek parliament.

So they have to ask the EU before they may even discuss a law, much less pass it. That is smart, if you want to hide the fact that you have a shadow government. 

&gt; The EU cannot prevent the Greek parliament from passing any laws, this rule simply requires Tsirpas to inform them about what he intends to propose to the parliament and to take their feedback into account.

Exactly. Tsipras, or any other part of the government can't even discuss new measures with the press, much less the parliament without approval from the EU first. Anything that has approval from the EU may later be discussed and may, at some point, even become a law or a measure. The shadow government starts much earlier in the political process. If the EU was to include a measure to prevent laws from being passed in parliament, you would have a huge outcry about a powerful EU meddleing in Greek affairs if the EU was to use their power at that very last stage of the political process. The way it is currently introduced is much smarter. They are basically censoring the lawmaking process.

Instead of that we have had deficit spending by the greek government every year since 2008 until 2014 (when there was a small primary surplus). That deficit was only possible because of the lending by the troika. 

So the greek government has had a lot more money to spend because of the money ""lent"" to them by the troika. I say ""lent"" because it is not coming back.

Freiheit von Forschung und Lehre ist auch ein schützenswertes Gut, und dazu kann auch gehören dass man aus Akademikermund Dinge hört die man als politisch unkorrekt oder dem eigenen Weltbild nicht entsprechend empfindet. Zumal die Aussage dass eine Partei die sich gewisser, barbarischer Mittel nicht bedient, einen Nachteil hat eigentlich als Allgemeinplatz gelten dürfte. Als äußerster Maßstab der nicht überschritten werden darf muß hier zunächst der Boden des Grundgesetzes herhalten.

&gt; das dieser Typ gedeckt wird

Falls Diskussionsbedarf besteht ist eine Diskussion sicher nötig. Allerdings muss dabei meiner Meinung nach konservativ vorgegangen werden. In einem anderen Kontext (Sexismus statt Geschichtsklitterung) ist es da meiner Meinung nach vor Kurzem zu einer Überreaktion gekommen: Fall Tim Hunt, der auf einem Social Dinner was Dummes gesagt hat (die Geschichte dass man sich entweder in Frauen verliebt, andersrum, oder sie heulen rum). Da wäre nach normalen Maßstäben eine formelle Verwarnung durch den AG angemessen gewesen, aber im Zuge eines Shitstorms wurde gleich gefeuert. Im Nachhinein kam dann heraus dass der Kontext *möglicherweise* ein klarer Jokus war, und dass die den Shitstorm lostretende Person auch nicht eine Ausgeburt von Unschuld war, aber der Schaden war angerichtet. Da halte ich es für richtig, dass sich der Fachbereit erstmal vor das Personal stellt. Feuern geht immer noch, und Internet-Shitstorms sind selten ein guter Ratgeber für Handlungen. Man nimmt ja auch keinen pöbelnden Mob als Ausgangspunkt, sondern schaut in Ruhe nach, warum es diesen Mob gibt und ob er einen Tag später immer noch Ausgangspunkte hat.

Als zweiter Punkt ist (eher im Falle Münkler, der mir sonst nicht weiter bekannt ist) das Ungleichgewicht von anonymen Blogs zu nennen. Dagegen kann man sich so gut wie nicht verteidigen, wenn die Blogschreiber nicht willens sind, an einer ordentlichen Diskussion von Angesicht zu Angesicht teilzunehmen (aus Gründen, dich ich nachvollziehen kann). Das ist besonders schwer wenn es sich nicht um Personen des öffentlichen Lebens im engeren Sinne handelt, sondern eben um Hochschullehrer die sich jede Woche in eine Halböffentlichkeit (Vorlesung) begeben, dort dann auch das Publikum mit einbeziehen sollen aber gleichzeitig damit rechnen müssen, dass jeder Übertritt eines Tabus öffentlich seziert wird. Das halte ich für problematisch.

&gt; Ideally, we would like to live in a world where we just basically don't need health care -- i.e. preventative policies ought to be looked at.

I couldn't agree with you more.

&gt; I believe that all of them are privatised.

And they make their money with exorbitant student fees. I'd like to not see Europeans worry about 100k€ student debt that will never go away.

&gt; But I go to a business and engineering school. The freshmen already get significant different curricula. The school has to move with the job market and demand of businesses, and that moves really quickly. But perhaps that is different for more static academic subjects, like physics?

I was talking about schools, not colleges or universities. Of course in an academic setting things move so fast that a private (and international) industry is necessary. I don't think it would be good for the state either if they had to write 101s on Indonesian - that seems excessive. But yes, with college and university students digitalisation would be a lot simpler, especially if you live in a country with a proper support system.

&gt; In my view: every policy is more bureaucracy, less freedom and less efficiency.

Basic difference of philosophy, I do believe that humans can and would try to be efficient all on their own if they knew that the benefit of society is also their own, and moreso if the apparatus behind them was democratic. It's one of the basic problems of philosophy - the question whether some ways of thinking are art of human conditioning are almost entirely culturally indoctrinated. There have been studies in Germany on ethical and social differences between people who have grown up in the capitalist West and the communist East with the outcome that people who had grown up in the East were slightly more generous. And given the general difference of attitudes between Europeans and Americans I'm beginning to think that human culture can be - over several generations - be modified towards a thinking were people are willing to work harder purely for the benefit of society as a whole.

&gt; Economists have been speculating, but no concrete study has been done.

I'm honestly not sure whether it can be done at all. There are so many other variables at work here, some of which would be incredibly hard to quantify, the formula would be massive.

&gt; and that parental love overshadows money incentives. 

I'd say at 0% it's not a question of incentives but food on the table. I'm guessing the actual percentage wouldn't be a steady one but an adjusted value depending on the countries economy.

is contrary to the whole point of the EZ. If a member-state was to be abandoned at the first problem in order for someone to not get the blame(also no one is blaming solely the EZ for Greece's problems, of course Greece has the most blame in the whole thing, that's a given even among the Greeks), then might as well not have a Union in the first place.

&gt;yes but the return to a drachma means that imports are reduced and exports increase. their economy rebalances to a more sustainable level.

That's so laughable. Greece in an import nation, not an export one, it imports pretty much everything. Exports? Really?! Greece is going to compete with Germany?? Or the rest of the mediterranean nations on exports?! Okay, I wonder why no one thought of that before...Good luck with that.

null,false,TurnipPhone,null,null,null,"Even though I am a strong supporter of the EU, I cannot really support further integration towards a federation. The Euro has shown on monetary level how this type of co-operation works and frankly you can see results on the news. The cultural and economic gap between the South and the North (and West and the East) will be a major issue that is nearly impossible to tackle.  Even now, the European Commission and the Parliament are implanting so-called “North-Western” (strict austerity, wider bureaucracy, exponential taxation) policies on Greece that work in the economically efficient North but not in the Southern Europe (at least not successfully in Greece).  Of course this is an attempt to (finally) solve the economic crisis in Greece but it shows how different Europe is, and how the North is trying to revamp Southern Euro countries to become more like them.  Whilst the Southern economy is highly based on tourism (of course Spain and Northern Italy have more industries) and North on high value exports, the economic differences will always play part in the European politics and evidently that would affect to the structure of the European Federation.  How could the Federation unbiasedly develop the economy of the whole nation when the structures of the states’ economies are so highly different. Even today, there is lot of discontent discussion how the Northern money is automatically given to develop the economies of Eastern Europe and to help Southern Countries to recover from recession. That money is ‘only’ like 0.5% of their GPDs but imagine the situation in a federation where that amount of money would be a lot higher. 

The cultural aspect of the federation would be even a bigger problem. As you mentioned, there’s no previous example of a Federation of Nation States (were not using Soviet Union as an example…). All the contemporary federations are quite heterogenic and they were established to either to govern a large geographical mass (USA), to reunite separated states together (Germany) or to stop ethnic/religious violence (Switzerland).  On the scale of Europe, that would mean uniting almost thirty states together, with immense cultural diversity, five main religions and who-knows how many languages. Even when taking baby steps, there would already be an immense power vacuum to be filled by Germany and (German-speaking) Austria who would consist 1/7 of the whole population. Compared to United States, their biggest state is California that has approximately 1/10 of the whole population. Of course Germany is the biggest economy and the most populous country so by democratic rules, it would deserve to have most influential voice in the federation but that would also cause lot of discontent among other states. Also, how to combine different policies, cultural traditions, political behavior (including foreign policy e.g. Anti-USA, pro-USA, Anti-Russia, Pro-Russia states, role of China and India etc.) 

Of course there would be lots and lots of other aspects to think about but I am frankly running out of space and I want to finally have my evening tea. :P But at the moment, I don’t see a proper reason for federalism but you never know what happens in the following years. Maybe we will fall too much behind and we have to correspond by establishing united European Federation. We’re living interesting times! Sorry for the long post!

Basically another income tax, created to fund reunification projects and other costs. Only goes to the federal government (the regular income tax is split between local, state, and federal government)

&gt; Krankenversicherung

With your salary (which is above 450€) you are required to be part of the German public health insurance. You should be insured somewhere and your salary slip usually says the name of the health fund somewhere. Most likely you are insured through AOK Hessen.

(Note: If you were insured through a EU public insurer this might be a bit more complicated.)

&gt; Rentenversicherung

You are required to pay this even as a student. If you don't go on to work longer in Germany you can get this back in a few years time.

&gt; Arbeitslosenversicherung

Depending on how your job is classified you might be exempt from this. HR should usually know how the job is classified (heck, they save money too in this case).

&gt; Pflegeversicherung

Basically another kind of health-insurance (long-term care to be exact). All the same rules as with health insurance applies and goes under the same branding as regular health insurance.

Are they students at German universities by any chance? In that case they most likely pay for health insurance separately and don't need the *Arbeitslosenversicherung*. But even then, *Rentenversicherung* and *Lohnsteuer* where nobody is exempt is more than the 100€ you quoted.

Yes and you know what is interesting -- as Sowell has argued -- we do not disagree on politics but the deeper underlying visions. Thomas Sowell came with the underlying visions of certain political positions. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Conflict_of_Visions

So fundamentally, we disagree on the view of Human Nature (a factual debate). I noted that in your remark about the human culture. 

[Steven Pinker](http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/media_articles/2002_10_30_upi.html) says the following: 

* They are the different visions of human nature that underlie left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The distinction comes from the economist Thomas Sowell in his wonderful book ""A Conflict of Visions."" According to the Tragic Vision, humans are inherently limited in virtue, wisdom, and knowledge, and social arrangements must acknowledge those limits. According to the Utopian vision, these limits are “products” of our social arrangements, and we should strive to overcome them in a better society of the future. Out of this distinction come many right-left contrasts that would otherwise have no common denominator. 

* Rightists tend to like tradition (because human nature does not change), small government (because no leader is wise enough to plan society), a strong police and military (because people will always be tempted by crime and conquest), and free markets (because they convert individual selfishness into collective wealth). 

* Leftists believe that these positions are defeatist and cynical, because if we change parenting, education, the media, and social expectations, people could become wiser, nicer, and more peaceable and generous.

That's not necessarily a con. A democratic federal state would allow everyone to vote on a federal parliament and senate, on a federal government, etc. This means that you'd have direct control over federal policies.

Of course, with more people involved, your vote means ""less"". But that's not necessarily a bad thing, because states keep powers to elect their own government, and make their own decisions when it comes to local things. You can't say that a state in the US is completely subservient to the federal government and is unable to make any decisions, right?

&gt;It would probably help poorer 'states', but wouldn't be as good for the wealthier. Why? Because in a federation it would be critical that all the state economies function well. If one economy goes down, the federal government has to help it.

A federal government would have powers to control the smaller states if they start screwing up, for example a federal tax agency that could fight corruption in any state (like the IRS).

Negotiations to help a failing state wouldn't be simply ""If you promise to do this, I'll give you the money"", depending completely on trust. It'd be ""We make you do this, and we give you money"".

This means that it's also good for wealthier states (compared to the current situation) because they'd have instruments to use to enforce stability at federal level.

&gt;Some say that people will be more distanced from politics. Let's be honest, most people don't really know what is happening in the European parliament. But on the other hand, a federation could change this.

With much more powerful federal institutions, that would probably stop being the case. You can't say that someone in the US doesn't know anything about the federal government, right? If you give the institutions enough power, parties themselves will start campaigning for votes much strongly. If you open up all the federal level decision making processes to a parliament/senate, instead of simply having the Eurogroup decide things behind closed doors, you'd make everything more accountable and give people more reason to follow the events.

&gt;if it is so hard to create a new party in your country, because you aren't satified with the current ones, imagine how harder it would be to do so in a massive federation.

There wouldn't be any reason why your state cannot have non-federal parties, though, or independents.

&gt;Possibly we would fall in a two-party system like in the USA(this already happens in many countries).

Maybe look at Germany as an example of a federal system where there is a bigger plurality of opinion with many parties in the parliament. USA's two-party system is mainly due to their electoral system. This all depends on implementation.

As with anything, most of the cons depend on exact implementation. If done right, there is very little disadvantages of such a federation, mostly down to the loss of sovereignty.

I think most people just assume it wouldn't be done right, though.

----------

[You can read the European Federalist Party's programme here](http://federalistparty.eu/our-positions/our-political-programme/), for more details on what a federal system *might* entail.

Some choice quotes (emphasis mine):

&gt;Half of all European citizens do not believe that their voice has any impact in European elections. We therefore propose **the creation of a representative European government, headed by a democratically elected President and accountable to a bicameral European parliament**. One chamber shall represent European citizens; the other shall represent member states. **The European parliament shall have the right to initiate legislation.**

&gt;[...]

&gt;The EFP supports the federation of European countries with the objective to give more power to the European citizens **according to the principle of subsidiarity and of better management** whatever is their ethnic or cultural background. In this view the **EFP supports that certain policies are better dealt with at the European level while other are better managed at the regional, national or local levels.** At the same time, the EFP does not support claims that are made purely on the basis of nationalistic or ethnic principles.

&gt;[...]

&gt;Similarly, a social mobility fund could further motivate people to look for opportunities elsewhere in Europe by reducing the costs of relocation.

&gt;Finally, we support **the development of a European labour agency** able to bridge the gap between demand and supply of jobs across Europe and facilitating better coordination between European social systems. This is necessary to **ensure the transferability of social and pension rights for citizens living and working across Europe throughout their life.**

&gt;[...]

&gt;We therefore believe that one of the reforms that need to be implemented is **the definition of minimum social standards** such as minimum revenue indexed to the cost of living at local level and the commitment to ensure that decent working conditions are applied to each worker in Europe. **These measures should be an integral part of Europe’s social dimension.**

&gt;[...]

&gt;Most currency unions have the ability – through a strong national or federal budget – to help particular regions of the monetary union facing asymmetric macroeconomic difficulties. This is beneficial for everyone, because in interlinked and interdependent economies, a social or economic problem in one country can quickly become troublesome for others, just as progress in one country can boost economic growth in others.

&gt;Indeed, **since the profits of the internal market are shared throughout Europe, the burden of economic hardship should also be shared**. We need to promote cross-community cohesion and solidarity in times of economic distress to ensure that an excessive gap in the living standards and opportunities of European citizens does not expand. Therefore, alongside an internal market that ensures efficiency through competition between European regions and businesses, **a European complementary safety net should also be in place**.

&gt;We would also like to see a renewed focus on those budget items that promote greater territorial and social cohesion, hence reducing disparity between people and regions across Europe. This is crucial to develop a competitive and inclusive European society.  We wish to promote **a solidarity scheme at European level** that works as an automatic stabiliser, such as a **European-wide unemployment benefit scheme or an unconditional basic income guarantee scheme for each European citizen.**

&gt;[...]

&gt;To reach our common goals, **Europe should have its own resources while reducing the overall tax burden on each European citizen**. We wish to use a European budget to fund those policies that deliver value for our citizens, such as the creation of an integrated European energy market, support for local environmental policies, industrial policy and transport infrastructure. A financial transaction tax approved by the European Parliament as currently debated in the EU as well as environmental levies could also be considered.

&gt;[...]

&gt;**A democratically legitimate oversight of national budgets should also be put in place at the federal level** in order to ensure that member states do not generate uncontrolled amounts of debt in the years ahead.

&gt;[...]

&gt;The EFP believes that **the mandate of the European Central Bank should be extended beyond maintaining price stability ensuring that economic growth and employment are also taken into account**, as happens in the United States.

&gt;[...]

&gt;Currently European citizens living in other member states can vote for local elections and European elections, but not for all national elections. **In a federal Europe, every European citizen would have the right to vote and to stand in all elections that are held in the member state where he/she resides.**  This would be in line with the principle of the free movement of citizens, and with the objective of fostering active citizenship.

&gt;[...]

&gt;**We consider that there cannot be a true functioning democracy in Europe if we do not have true European political parties.** Currently the European Federalist Party is the only bottom-up and pan-European political party that is able to present candidates in several European countries who defend the same political programme. In fact, the other entities that take part in European elections are often alliances of national parties. It is therefore a matter of urgency to **establish a simplified procedure to register pan-European political parties** and to allow them to present candidates for European elections without having to follow all the different national legislations. We also call for the creation of trans-national lists that would **allow candidates to be voted for by Europeans regardless of their place of residence or of nationality.**",null,0,null,1436994177,null,0,1436999431,0,ct4licz,null,t3_3de5p9,null,t1_ct4licz,null,t1_ct4dskp,null,null,null,1437881365,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

null,false,rondabyarmbar,GREE,Greece,null,"The 100k apt would've been double that, or more pre-crisis. Prices for smallish apts in central Athens have reduced dramatically. Keep in mind that there are ""hidden"" costs when renting or buying. A 400euro apt could end up costing ~100euros more, if you include heating bills, electricity, communal costs etc. I'm sure Canada has similar ""hidden"" costs. 

For places in greece, I obviously recommend Athens, not only because it's a great city but due to its infrastructure. The biggest airport is in Athens, the biggest port, the metro etc. It would also make sense to use Athens as a base and then travel around the country or in Europe. Furthermore, Athens has everything. You could stay in southern Athens and live next to the beach. Central Athens to be close to center and shops/bars etc. Crete would also be a nice play to stay but with a small airport and bad infrastructure it would make your life harder. Thessaloniki is nice too and the city has a more laid back attitude (too laid back imho). Smaller islands are pretty nice too, but they tend to be a bit ""dead"" during the winter.

Hour seems to last 50 years. And QE has just been done - ECB did it's part and then some. Central banks are not there to fix deficits in budget. Prime minister does not control central banks! Please stop pretending that taxes earned and spent are not 99% of the issue here! Please stop making this about debt, or Euro value, or rates, or ECB or IMF or Germany or France or some other foreign factor that has nothing to do with Greece. This is Greece's public budget issue lightyears before anything else. It's inside Greece problem that needs to be fixed by Greece people within their own power and rights. Yea, creditors will get burned as well, so it's is kinda their problem too. Just like me defaulting on my mortgage is both mine and bank's problem. Bank may lose some money over me, but I lose much much more. And sure I can also blame the central bank, interest rates, the lack of inflation, real estate market or of course the greedy deaf bank itself unwilling to cut me some slack. Greece got better treatment by any foreign financial entity in any way than any other country. They just need to get their budget straight, nothing else is required. Yea, you are right, Croatia's debt is also soaring and I have no doubt we will end up in the same place in 30 years. I do blame each and every our government for it, buying votes and social peace by taking money from our own children. It will bite us in the ass, just as Greece is feeling it now. It's clear as day where is the problem coming from, I don't understand why would anyone try to make it something else. It's not hour of need caused by some natural catastrophe, it's mandates and mandates of really really poor financial choices and bad long term management due to lack of any responsibility for growing debt or anything really that outlives single mandate.

Of course we would be making decisions for ourselves. Although, more than 1 state would contribute into the decision-making process, and much more numerous interests are to be represented. Even so, the supra-national authority would very much be representing EU citizens and their interests. 

A superstate is a false notion. A federation is not as simple. The federal level is accorded specific areas of competences in which it can act. Any actions outside that areas of competences, or enroches into state level matters would firmly be shut down. In this aspect, an EU federal state would receive foreign and security policy, union wide competence (such as monetary policy), and a small number of other areas. Everything else would state solely on the state level. If anything, a federalization would withdraw from present EU powers as it would represent a withdrawal from certain areas which are currently covered by inter-governmentalism (CAP comes to mind).

null,false,DDdms,null,null,null,"&gt; quante lingue conosci, a che livello (con quali lavori?) e che formazione hai seguito.

Ne conosco 6: italiano, inglese, francese, spagnolo, cinese mandarino e tibetano, ma lavoro più spesso con 3: inglese, spagnolo e cinese. Corso di laurea in ""Interpretariato di Conferenza"".

&gt; generalmente le simultanee dove le fai? Conferenze? Tv? Nel caso ti chiamassero per conferenze tecniche ti vai a vedere prima l'argomento, le parole tecniche?

Esiste una associazione [edit: internazionale] (ahinoi non esiste un albo) che si chiama AIIC (Associazione [edit: Internazionale] Interpreti di Conferenza) e il corso di laurea che ho seguito si chiama ""Interpretariato di Conferenza"", quindi capisci da solo che l'80% del lavoro viene proprio dalle conferenze. Però capita di tutto: set televisivi e cinematografici, piccole e grandi aziende, privati, studi legali, agenzie varie... 

Studiarsi l'argomento è la prima regola: conoscere una lingua non significa conoscere tutto lo scibile che quella cultura linguistica ha partorito in secoli (e talvolta millenni) di storia. In genere leggo moltissimi articoli sulla materia, mi faccio dare del materiale utile dal committente (quando si può: il tribunale non ti dà mai un cazzo ad esempio, per ovvie ragioni), faccio glossari, tappezzo casa di post-it con parole chiave etc.

&gt; mai avuto momenti in cui non capivi ciò che dovevi tradurre? (Non tanto le singole parole, ma il senso generale) come hai reagito?

Capita più spesso di quanto immagini, è per questo che si seguono corsi di laurea appositi. In quei casi cerchi di concludere il discorso senza dire niente che possa tradire il tuo oratore. Male che va, hai tradotto male un periodo solo. Sai, in simultanea ascolti una lingua mentre traduci in un'altra e questo non significa che riesci ad ascoltare l'oratore e te stesso mentre parli nello stesso momento! Quindi la maggior parte delle volte ascolto l'oratore e parlo senza ascoltarmi, affidandomi alla mia esperienza e alla mia conoscenza della lingua. Il 90% delle volte esco dalla cabina e non ricordo quasi nulla di quello che ho detto.

Le cose peggiori sono le barzellette e i giochi di parole: non hai tempo per pensare, e devi trovare una soluzione alla svelta.

&gt; viaggi tanto? Hai doppiato gente famosa?

Durante le ""vacanze"" sì. Cerco di viaggiare ogni volta che posso, generalmente vado nei posti in cui si parla la lingua che conosco meno. Purtroppo il Tibet è difficile da raggiungere perché devi passare attraverso la burocrazia cinese (è una zona a rischio per loro, quindi ti fanno problemi). Se intendi viaggiare per lavoro non tanto perché dovrebbero pagarmi la diaria più il viaggio più l'alloggio più il vitto, quindi in genere chi ha bisogno di un interprete parte da solo e si cerca l'interprete in loco.

""Doppiato"" no. ""Tradotto"" sì: registi, attori, politici.

&gt; cosa ne pensi del film ""the interpreter""?

Quello con Nicole Kidman, giusto? L'ho visto anni fa e non ricordo moltissimo della trama (film del cazzo, onestamente), però per quel poco che ricordo la professione è stata rappresentata degnamente.

&gt; cosa più bizzarra che hai dovuto tradurre e quella più divertente.

Di cose bizzarre ne capitano tante. Mi è capitato un italiano che, durante una trattativa commerciale, a un certo punto ha deciso di raccontare una storiella divertente proprio nel momento clou della trattativa. La controparte ha spalancato gli occhi e ha chiesto al tipo di ripetere perchè ""evidentemente l'interprete si è sbagliato"".

I'm sure it doesn't have anything to do with that. Hungary cares about minorities in neighboring countries when they help winning elections/seats. Otherwise they are ignored.

Though if you reply to this post, I cant promise a follow-up before tomorrow afternoon :)

For you first point, I dont think anyone (least of all the Federalists) are supporting a stronger political federation without developing a Fiscal Union first. If anything, the failures of some of the Euro-states (not the Euro) has shown what many thought painfully obvious back in the late 1990's and early 2000's, that a Common Fiscal Union must follow immediately or shortly after the Common Currency, was sidestepped in favour of the Euro. The lack of such can be blamed on a variety of reasons, the one that made the most sense to me was the lack of political will. I had the great pleasure of listening to a presentation of the Euro-crisis (Euro Country Crisis as he called it) by Mario Monti back in mid 2014 and he primarily blamed the lack of a Fiscal Union on the lack of political will. He outlined very clearly that the development and furthering of the European Project is dependent on Good-Will as a resource, the monetary union was deemed more important as it would tie Europeans closer towards a shared identity (of which i think it has succeeded). As for the problem as to the whole ""northern Europe paying for southern Europe"", that seems very normal to me. We benefit from having economically stable and advanced neighbours and countries in our immediate Export/Import area (The Single Market). But I guess at some point it is as much a question of identity and similarity as it is one of economic efficiency. Nobody in their right mind would propose to throw out an unproductive region of their nation-state, you would instead invest in it and spend money to bring it back on track. 

As for the cultural issues, I think a closer political system would work well to ground that problem down. You mention the U.S. as an example yourself and while larger states have more political powers than small ones (as is the most democratic), you still have the Senate (2 senators from each state, big or small) having an equal voice to the House of Representatives. We have our own kind of system (sort of) in the Commission and in the Council, which does well to balance out the role played by larger countries (though how effective that is can be argued). Different viewpoints and stances can be found internally in every nation-state anyways, is that ineffective? Of course. A completely streamlined and consensus-driven policy would be most effective, but in reality very unrealistic. I often feel that I have more in common politically with young urban university students from around the EU than I for example have with a 50 year older rural pensioner. The only thing I have in common there is language and what national team I cheer for when the European Championship rolls around in 2016. 

I know that the lack of influence will be felt, but I really and honestly think that for a country as small as mine, the only way we can stay relevant is to group together with other small countries. The world is just getting to big for a 5-million people country to make itself felt anywhere.

&gt;Why would we make much faster progress in a political union?

Standardisation, removing corruption, bureaucracy and barriers/friction.

&gt;&gt;I want companies to freely operate, universities to cooperate and students to study in any EU country without the burden of bureaucracy.

&gt;That pretty much exists now, but it is utterly irrelevant to your initial points about scientific endeavour.. Oh and how does universities cooperating involve political union?

Scientific progress is 100% linked to the efficiency of universities and freedom of company operations. Hiring people from other EU countries is really complicated compared to just hiring from the same country from my experience.

&gt;&gt;I want complete freedom of movement

&gt;You have that now.

No, there are still rules and regulations and bureaucracy that prevent EU citizens from living wherever they want. Moving from one EU country to another is magnitudes more complicated than just moving to another city in the same country.

&gt;&gt;and the same welfare policies applied throughout the EU.

&gt;Which again, doesn't seem to have any relevance you your initial point and seems to be a 'I want to hand off responsibility to a federal government because..' rather than a justification..

Social welfare and scientific progress. Pick two or none.

&gt;I don't think harmonisation and attempts at homogenization across the EU would create a boom in all fields of society. If anything I think it will create conflict and costs, I think it will create inefficiencies, increase corruption, harm consumers and so on...

* Berserk (non finirà mai!)
* Gin no Saji (o Silver Spoon, dalla stessa mangaka di FMA ma tutt'altro genere: tratta della vita in una scuola superiore di agricultura, ma ha come target comunque dei diciottenni o giù di lì)
* Liar Game (già citato, molto avvincente)
* Kekkaishi (ma se non ti piace FMA probabilmente non ti piacerà nemmeno questo)
* Angel Densetsu (storia atipica e quasi stupida, ma l'ho letta e riletta molte volte senza mai stancarmi)

A prosperous Greece, all else held equal, is certainly in Germany's interest.  But that's also not what's on offer -- there are no guarantees of success and it's not the case that everything else is held equal.  It might be that Germany's assessment is that ""even if we pump another $100B in, we are unlikely to cause Greece to be self-sustaining"", or perhaps ""the precedent being set here of non-good-faith borrowing is more-harmful than Greece leaving"", or perhaps ""the return simply isn't worth the cost"" and if that's the case, sure, Germany would have an interest in writing Greece off.

I *don't* think that Germany is trying to secretly somehow screw over Greece, and doubly so not from the beginning.  But I am not at all certain that Germany or other EZ members haven't hit the point of cutting losses.

So making a difference at some point that is based on a category alone (in this case gender) is a discrimination. 

Unfortunately (or fortunately) there's a difference between marriage and civil parternships in Germany which makes them not legally equal. For example if two individuals fulfill the requirements to adopt except for their gender then you have a discrimination.

As long as they have an equivalent institution that is functionally equal but still separate? ""Separate but equal?"" I wonder where I've heard that phrase before. Oh that's right. By the American proponents of racial discrimination who argued that it doesn't violate the 14th amendment's Equal Protection clause if the government provides an equivalent service/institution for black people as it does to white people.


If US municipalities were to create a new set of perfectly good water fountains, then demand that black people only use those fountains because ""well they're practically the same as the fountains that white people use...I don't see what's the big deal,"" I don't think anyone would argue that that isn't discrimination.

So why is it not discrimination when countries create a separate institution called a civil union, give civil unions the same benefits as marriages, then say ""Gay people may *only* have civil unions. They're practically the same as the marriages that straight people can get...I don't see what's the big deal.""?

I'm not sure how political union removes corruption, or reduces bureaucracy and barriers/friction. Standardisation on the other hand doesn't require political union..

&gt;Scientific progress is 100% linked to the efficiency of universities and freedom of company operations.

No.. it isn't. It's linked to funding, basic research, the education system, commercial military and other drivers. 

&gt;Hiring people from other EU countries is really complicated compared to just hiring from the same country from my experience.

Hiring someone from within the EEA is exactly the same as hiring a national in my experience, you can't even discriminate on that basis. And we managed that without political integration...

&gt;No, there are still rules and regulations and bureaucracy that prevent EU citizens from living wherever they want. Moving from one EU country to another is magnitudes more complicated than just moving to another city in the same country.

Really? I've moved between EU countries, the moving part and residency related elements seem to be about the same and a tiny part of the move (finding somewhere to live and all the rest of it is a much bigger burden..).

&gt;Social welfare and scientific progress. Pick two or none.

Lovely line, but again your opinion not  based on anything that I can think of..

&gt;Except we see the exact opposite happen in pretty much all eastern European countries.

And you think that an EU superstate will get rid of that rather than having that integrated into and eating away at EU institutions?

Two years too late, during which a small fire grew into a raging inferno. That's the magic of compound interest.

&gt;And QE has just been done - ECB did it's part and then some. 

Yeah, they're putting 60 billion in QE on the market - cheap credit, but only for the private banks, including the ones who needed to be bailed out in 2007 and caused the banking crisis. But not for Greece, and not for countries.

&gt;entral banks are not there to fix deficits in budget.

No, they're there to provide a cushion for unexpected shocks, like for example dozens of overleveraged private banks threatening to go bankrupt unless they are recapitalized with billions *right now*. 

Any other central bank would have threatened to provide that necessary liquidity to stem the tide, and the threat alone would have kept the bond rates low.

&gt;Please stop pretending that taxes earned and spent are not 99% of the issue here! 

For Greece's part of the responsibility, it was. But that's only one of the three main causes.

&gt;Please stop making this about debt, or Euro value, or rates, or ECB or IMF or Germany or France or some other foreign factor that has nothing to do with Greece.

Why? Do you get uncomfortable if you don't have an easy scapegoat?

The policy of their central bank (the ECB) is definitely something that affects Greece, and they don't have control over that. Banks teetering on the edge of bankruptcy is definitely something that affects Greece, and they don't have control over that either: it's just shit that happens and needs to be cleaned up.

As to the institution of marriage with all its religious connotations being reserved to men and women, I'm fine with it. As long as the legal situation is resolved that shouldn't concern anybody and nobody can seriously be surprised that a conservative party would take any other position.

as is this.

The leading EU countries don't really need the EU to keep up, Italy/Germany/France/UK are still going to be important powers EU or not, if there was a Nordic Union it would be more than adequate at keeping up.

There are a few simple questions really, who cares? can they do it? what will they do?


Who cares? A Nordic Union has given no indication to impact these nations positions within the international system. A shake up that causes wealthy, competitive and modern states to suddenly become outcasted and irrelevant isn't worth considering in this example.

Can they do it? Why are people so confident in broken and riddled with issue states simply because they've hit some growth and are ""big"". I'm personally far more confident in countries that actually hold on the reigns of power and have their situation together. This isn't to say that the up and coming countries can't be successful more so that its easier to maintain than gain really.

What would they do is probably the most important really, even if countries like India and Brazil leave a Nordic Union in the dust on graphs and charts does this actually do anything negative for the Nordic countries?  It isn't all zero-sum or whatever is it.

Das ist eine sehr fade Umschreibung sehr viel deutlicherer Äußerungen. 

&gt; Zumal die Aussage dass eine Partei die sich gewisser, barbarischer Mittel nicht bedient, einen Nachteil hat eigentlich als Allgemeinplatz gelten dürfte.

'Nen Scheiss dürfte sie. Wenn du das behaupten willst, behaupte und belege es.

&gt; Als äußerster Maßstab der nicht überschritten werden darf muß hier zunächst der Boden des Grundgesetzes herhalten.

&gt; Da halte ich es für richtig, dass sich der Fachbereit erstmal vor das Personal stellt. Feuern geht immer noch, und Internet-Shitstorms sind selten ein guter Ratgeber für Handlungen.

Uh, das ist mir schon klar. Aber wenn dieser Typ in einem Artikel, wo dieses seine Aussagen nichtmal benannt werden, nur so vage faselt, dass ""Unsinn"" über ihn verbreitet wird, scheint mir das nicht nach Einsicht oder Jokus.

&gt; Man nimmt ja auch keinen pöbelnden Mob als Ausgangspunkt, sondern schaut in Ruhe nach, warum es diesen Mob gibt und ob er einen Tag später immer noch Ausgangspunkte hat.

Hat man hier aber wohl nicht gemacht.

&gt; Eine linke Studentengruppe kritisiert diese Äußerungen. Der Leiter des historischen Instituts der HU fordert Lehrende und Studierende nun auf, Baberowski gegen die kritischen Studenten zu verteidigen.

&gt; ""Das ist ein Hammer"", sagt Johannes Schott, ein Sprecher der Studentengruppe IYSSE. ""Uns die Kritik zu verbieten geht zu weit."" Am Dienstag schrieben Vertreter von IYSSE, der Jugendorganisation der trotzkistischen Partei für soziale Gleichheit, einen offenen Brief an die Leitung der Hochschule. Darin fordern sie vor allem die Rückkehr zur sachlichen Kritik. Die HU-Leitung äußert sich zu dem Schreiben auf Nachfrage der taz nicht, weil sie die Vorwürfe als ""haltlos"" erachtet, so ein Sprecher. 

Der ""pöbelnde Mob"", der eine Rückkehr zu sachlicher Kritik fordert, und eiskalt in sehr ernsten Bedenken ignoriert wird?

&gt; Als zweiter Punkt ist (eher im Falle Münkler, der mir sonst nicht weiter bekannt ist) 

Das ist ja alles schön und fein, beantwortet aber meine Fragen zu *Baberowski* nicht.

Aber ja, ich finde anyonyme Massen Personen, Gruppen, und/oder Personen, die so tun, als sein sie Gruppen, auch mies. Aber ganz so simpel ist es hier halt nicht.

&gt; gleichzeitig damit rechnen müssen, dass jeder Übertritt eines Tabus öffentlich seziert wird

Man kann ALLES ""Tabubruch"" nennen. Was ist schon Verherrlichung von Kriegsverbrechen als schnöder ""Tabubruch""? Wann darf man endlich mal wieder ein fescher Nazi sein, sind 70 Jahre in den Bart nuscheln und auf Mensch machen nicht Opfer genug?

Es gibt Vergewaltigungen, es gibt falsche Anschuldigungen von Vergewaltigung, trotzdem muß man ihnen nachgehen. Das eine kann nicht hinter dem anderen versteckt, der eine Fall nicht mit dem anderen entschuldigt werden. 

Und man merkt sich irgendwie auch nur die ""shitstorms"", die durchaus auch existierende positive korrektive Wirkung dieser Wahrnehmung, dieser Überwachung *durch* die Massen, wenn man so will, wird einfach stillschweigend ignoriert. Hach ja, ist ja echt problematisch, wenn man nicht mehr einfach nur so konsequenzfrei von oben seine Gülle über Leuten ausbreiten kann, die gefälligst wehrlos zu sein haben.

&gt; You have to stop thinking that you're in charge and start thinking that you're having a dance. We used to think we're smart [...] but nobody is smarter than the internet. [...] One of the things we learned pretty early on is 'Don't ever, ever try to lie to the internet - because they will catch you. They will de-construct your spin. They will remember everything you ever say for eternity.'

&gt; You can see really old school companies really struggle with that. They think they can still be in control of the message. [...] So yeah, the internet (in aggregate) is scary smart. The sooner people accept that and start to trust that that's the case, the better they're gonna be in interacting with them.

However, if you want to even have a negotiation basis with China,India,USA, and be taken into consideration, then you need to have the same amount of power and influence. No country in europe can do that right now on an individual basis. Please see the extent to which UK has a completely independent foreign policy right now.

No, but the EU can negotiate on trade without political union and individual blocs can deal on the basis of their interests too. An EU superstate, or federal Europe would kill anything outside of EU positions for individual members states...  It simply doesn't make sense on the basis of the requirements.

&gt;Of course we would be making decisions for ourselves. Although, more than 1 state would contribute into the decision-making process, and much more numerous interests are to be represented. Even so, the supra-national authority would very much be representing EU citizens and their interests.

I'm not sure you can represent the interests of 500 million people effectively, the whole notion of subsidiarity is important, but seems to get rolled up quite rapidly when the shit hits the fan. So effectively you'd create a level of governance so far out of touch with normal people that it'd be hard to explain what it represents at all. And for no real benefit that I can really see at this point...

&gt;A superstate is a false notion. A federation is not as simple. The federal level is accorded specific areas of competences in which it can act. Any actions outside that areas of competences, or enroches into state level matters would firmly be shut down. 

Until someone misinterprets something about the common market, or decides that state x is doing something they don't like so they will impose a position or broaden their competencies.. At that point the state in question can no longer do anything independently. It's not a collection of peers any more, it is a collection of peers subordinate to a federal state with courts and a super-national power structure.

&gt;As you're from the UK, you'd have to think of it as a more cleared and defined relation between Scottish/Welsh/NI Parliaments and London, with Westminster only allowed to act on UK-wide issues, and british-wide interests. Everything else to be solved by the executives and parliaments of the regions.

And if you spend two minutes looking at how that works, you'd probably understand why the notion of a federal Europe is so appalling, not to mention that the size of the various levels of government in the UK are still comprehensible, adding a massive layer on top of that would make it considerably less so.  Not to mention that right now you'd have a hard time convincing anyone that the UK should look like four countries with their own parliaments and UK wide parliament on top (and council/regional authorities below).

I agree that tax evasion was and is a problem. The public sector was not massively bloated: they kept their expenses stable at 44,9% of GDP, slightly less than the European average of 46%.

&gt;I should say that there are times when a government is to blame, but in this case the Greek people were more than happy to live, as a collective, in an unsustainble manner for many years. And how did they react when everything came crashing down?

You skip the part where overleveraged private banks all over Europe threatened to come crashing down and take the financial system down with them, thereby forcing governments all over Europe, including Greece, to bail out their irresponsible businesses with tax money. *That* is the shock that pushed Greece over the edge, not their own policy. And that didn't even need to cause that much trouble, if only the eurozone had emergency liquidity institutions - but they hadn't, a sore construction fault. And when they finally provided that (two years too late, when the problem had snowballed), they attached destructive austerity conditions to it, which only made the problem worse.

There's still a lot of unemployment in some countries, but in general it looks like it's getting better and the economies start to grow at least a little bit. If you look at it objectively, the problems many countries had in the finacial crisis were home made (real estate bubble, banking bubble, not making neccesary reforms in general) and not due to the Euro or because of a strong German economy or some such.

null,false,ATEFred,null,null,null,"Give up sovereignty, which includes amongst other things: the ability for your country to decide on it's economic policies, tax levels, public spending, health system, welfare system. The ability to vote out your government every X years. The  ability to set its own laws (which includes the fundamental choice of whether the country adopts a common law system or a judicial law system). These are things which impact citizens in a meaningful manner on a daily basis.

The further up you move the power, the less impact on the ruling system you have as a voter, and the less accountable politicians end up being. 

If you don't like the way the European parliament and commission are handling things, there is effectively nothing you can do to change the ruling class. You can vote for MEPs, though your vote is so diluted the odds of it having any real impact are minimal. The commission president is then ""voted in"" by the parliament, though given that only one candidate is more often then not on offer (I'm still somewhat unclear who decides who that one candidate is, nation states somehow?), I'm not sure we can call it even an indirect democratic election. The commission is then appointed by the president and member states. These are the people who actually come up with the legislation for the MEPs to vote on as far as I can tell. 

I think most people would agree that there are so many layers in between the electorate and the people actually making decisions that democratic accountability is pretty low (without even mentioning the secret vote system, the unaudited books, repeated disdain and rejection of the results of democratic referendums, and so on and so forth).

This seems unlikely to result in decisions that will lead to further prosperity, or social progress compared to having sovereign nation states. It does seem however quite conducive to ballooning bureaucracy, unaccounted spending, corruption and embezzlement.

Cooperation is of course often useful, but this can (and does) occur without full political union. Interpol is a good example of that. Free trade agreements are another.

Finally, if by standardisation you are referring to tax harmonization, it sounds like a terrible idea to me. Tax competition is healthy and makes sure that different areas have the means to grow and attract business (even if they are not a large centre for XYZ at a particular moment in time) while at the same time preventing ever increasing tax levels.

Listening to spoken German is an excellent way of improving your listening comprehension, but as a beginner it is mostly only useful with transcripts. I would suggest that you at least get a basic understanding of German before doing this, because otherwise you will be completely lost.

So once again, first priority should be getting to a level where you understand basic German and can talk about yourself (chatting in German easily).

For spoken German with transcripts:

- Check out [Langsam Gesprochende Nachrichten](http://www.dw.com/de/deutsch-lernen/nachrichten/s-8030) (Slowly Spoken News) by Deutsche Welle. It is a daily news podcast spoken slowly and clearly. A transcript is always provided.

- To listen to more casual German, watch Türkisch für Anfänger, a German TV series about a teenage girl whose mother marries a Turkish father of two, resulting in the two families moving in together.

Then how do you explain that the problems got worse the more and the longer austerity was applied?

&gt;There were deeper cuts in other countries. 

No, there weren't. Greece made a 33% cut, no other Eurozone country even came near.

&gt;The fact that the GDP may have dropped the sharpest doesn't mean that the cuts were the deepest. Not when your GDP is fueled by mindless loans nobody expects you to ever be able to pay back and you don't have access to such loans all of a sudden.

[citation needed]

&gt;But I did. Austerity worked in every case but Greece. 

Well, eating less works perfectly for cases of obesity. But if you prescribe that to a patient with anemia you're only going to make him weaker. When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Stop pounding on the face of the Greeks with that hammer.

&gt;There is no problem with austerity. 

Austerity destroys the production of goods and services the more you apply it.

&gt;The problem is that those that oppose it don't offer a workable alternative. Just like communism was not a workable alternative to capitalism.

The workable alternative is to *not* strangle an economy to death.",null,0,null,1436997903,null,0,false,0,ct4nwcw,null,t3_3d9393,null,t1_ct4nwcw,null,t1_ct4n5u1,null,null,null,1437883227,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Whatever the bailout money was used for, it was not used to preserve pensions.

&gt;That is EXACTLY what I'm saying. The Greeks had to cut their pensions (reduce the amount per person) so they could pay them (so they would have enough money to pay everybody).

No, Greece has been forced deliberately to make cuts in pensions, not cuts in general.

We don't need to: their government expenses were reduced with 33% since 2009. No other country come close.

Their deficit was 5-10%, usually. The cuts were 33%. So that's at least three times as much as necessary to balance the budget.

null,false,LordGravewish,PORT,Portugal,null,"&gt;BTW, can you brealfly explain to me what does the Senate do

A bicameral system is usually used in a federal government. In a bicameral system, there are ""two parliaments"".

The lower chamber corresponds to what in Portugal is the ""Assembleia da Républica"". The lower chamber is supposed to be mostly proportional to the population, similar to ""1 person, 1 vote"" (although due to other issues you can never achieve 100% proportionality, and some places will weigh slightly more than others).

For a normal state, this effectively means that larger population centers have more weight, as they end up electing more MPs. For example, even in Portugal, a rural city will have less decision weight than the capital city of Lisbon, just for the simple fact that there are more people living in Lisbon and therefore more MPs representing it.

Now, while you might say that is fair, if taken to the extreme of a large country/federal state, you do not want a smaller state (like Portugal) being ""ignored"" because larger states (like Germany) have a much larger population. But you also don't want to make it so that a Portuguese person's vote is worth more (as it'd be unfair to the German people).

So what happens, for example in the US, is that you have a higher chamber (usually called the Senate). This chamber consists of multiple representatives of each state/region in the country, where each state/region elects the *same* number of representatives, no matter their population. For example, each US state elects **two** senators. No matter if there are 10 times as many people living in State 1 versus State 2.

This higher chamber usually has veto powers, and it's main reason for existing is so that states are not ""ignored"" during the decision-making process.

An advantage from having two chambers, is that you can add checks &amp; balances between them, where each chamber tries to make sure the other chamber is following the rules, so that there are now *two* chambers to corrupt instead of just one.

Wikipedia says this regarding the US Senate (emphasis mine):

&gt;The framers of the Constitution created a bicameral Congress primarily as **a compromise between those who felt that each state, since it was sovereign, should be equally represented, and those who felt the legislature must directly represent the people**, as the House of Commons did in the United Kingdom. This idea of having one chamber represent people equally, while the other gives equal representation to states regardless of population, was known as the Connecticut Compromise. **There was also a desire to have two Houses that could act as an internal check on each other**. **One was intended to be a ""People's House"" directly elected by the people**, and with short terms obliging the representatives to remain close to their constituents. **The other was intended to represent the states** to such extent as they retained their sovereignty except for the powers expressly delegated to the national government. The Senate was thus not intended to represent the people of the United States equally. **The Constitution provides that the approval of both chambers is necessary for the passage of legislation.**

In the current EU framework, the Council takes up the role of the higher chamber (representing the states), while the EU Parliament takes the role of the lower chamber (representing the people).

However, the construction of the Council (higher chamber) is flawed in that there is a single representative per country (so no plurality of opinion), representatives aren't elected directly for the job on European campaigns (they're the heads of the national government themselves), and most negotiations happen behind close doors so they aren't accountable, on top of being able to blame ""Brussels"" and not themselves whenever the electorate doesn't like one of their decisions. It also requires qualified majority (instead of just simple majority). These are just a few issues that make the Council end up being probably the worst of all the EU institutions when it comes to democratic legitimacy.

A real, correctly implemented federation, needs to get rid of the Council and replace it by a democratically elected Senate, with clear rules, procedures and transparency during negotiations, so that the representatives are directly accountable to the electorate.

-------------------

&gt; why is the USA electural system flawed

I might be slightly wrong on the details about the US election system, so maybe a US redditor can correct me if I make any mistake.

So, the way the Presidential elections in the US works, is that there is an electoral college where each state has a certain number of electoral votes for the president. People vote on a state-level on their preferred president, and then Electors are nominated by the state and are supposed to follow the popular vote, although the federal constitution does not specify exactly how that correspondence is made.

The problem is that most states have a winner-takes-all system. For example, Texas has 38 votes. Let's imagine the popular election results are 51% for John, 49% for Bill. **All** 38 electors will vote for John during the electoral college. This means that effectively, Bill *did not get a single vote even though the percentages came so close*, 49% of the state's population was completely ignored.

The results of such a system over a long time is that smaller parties or independents have no way of winning, because they'll never get a majority against a bigger party. Effectively, parties/independents are forced to join a larger party to get their voice heard, and any vote for a smaller party is basically a wasted vote. This also makes it hard to change the rules, because the larger parties have nothing to lose, and its hard for other parties to get elected.

As far as I know, the reasons for such a system are mostly historical (in an age without computers and internet and so on, it was hard to manage elections over such a large country as the US), so there's no reason that when building a federal state ""from scratch"", you'd not choose a different election process that can be much more proportional and representative of different parties and political persuasions.",null,0,null,1436998513,null,0,1436999810,0,ct4o9ys,null,t3_3de5p9,null,t1_ct4o9ys,null,t1_ct4ne9f,null,null,null,1437883531,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

I don't understand this.  It's been cited in the press linked to here frequently now.  Who are these people who believed that a Grexit was *impossible* at some point?  Sure, maybe people didn't expect that the path was as easy as it might have been (though I thought that it's equally been made clear over the past several years that there have been a lot of resources and effort from a lot of countries and people trying to avoid a Grexit).  But surely, surely if you went up to someone who really dealt with the risk of a country exiting, they wouldn't have said ""there is simply no chance of a country exiting the EZ"".

The EZ is also only fifteen years old, and what happens in a young, union that's still finding its feet isn't necessarily indicative of what happens in a fifty or hundred-year-old union.

Again, not saying that a Grexit will happen now.  I don't know whether it will or it won't, I'm no economist or expert on European politics, and pundits and media sources have been wildly swinging back and forth on this for some days now.  But I also have a hard time with certain-sounding claims that Greece leaving the EZ triggers the end of the EZ via some sort of psychological mechanism.

The beginning of austerity measures coincided with Greece coming clean about the incredible lies it has been telling about its finances. It also coincided with the global crisis that forced the Greek governments to come clean about their true state. Austerity caused the economic output to decrease in every country it was applied just like chemotherapy causes your hair to fall. It doesn't mean it's not helping tho.

lol

&gt;Well, eating less works perfectly for cases of obesity. But if you prescribe that to a patient with anemia you're only going to make him weaker. When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Stop pounding on the face of the Greeks with that hammer.

Exactly. For the amount of wealth it can actually generate without borrowing in an unsustainable manner, Greece was morbidly obese. It is still very fat. So fat that, without a lipo (the creditors taking a cut) it will never be fit. It is never lawful that creditors should lose money. When you take a loan you should pay it back.

&gt;Austerity destroys the production of goods and services the more you apply it.

Lack of austerity in a country that overborrowed and can't pay back will also destroy the entities that loaned those money in the first place, whether such entities are private entities or states. And that's just not very cool for creditors that expect an agreement to be observed, is it now?

&gt;The workable alternative is to not strangle an economy to death.

Greece is not dead. Greece is simply acting rich when in fact it is poor. Austerity allowed every other country but Greece to return to growth, it didn't strangle a single economy to death so far. Greece is the problem.

2 weeks ago we were all pitchforking for a hard Grexit, now we have Germany for being too harsh on Greece, wtf happened? Both of these opinions are nonsense.

I think we need more sensibility and human understanding. Be friendly, no matter of the origin and how your country is.

Also the Russia-hate is unreal, although lately Greece overshadowed this.


I think we should start embracing euroscepticism as a different opinion and people of different countries and maybe add some discussion room for **conservative** people. This place sometimes feels like a leftist-liberal-easygoing place.

No, not in the real world, not if you think the other person is an idiot wasting your time. The other side DOES not need to engage just because you want them to. They must want to do so.

&gt;On the one hand it's a sad that everybody automatically expects EU negotiations to be full of games, of bluffs and ultimatums and when a guy shows up who says what he means

I actually think it was the other way around. The EU was kind of saying the same thing (austerity, these rules, grexit) all along and it was Greece playing bluffs and games - referendum! Oxi!

&gt; Das ist eine sehr fade Umschreibung sehr viel deutlicherer Äußerungen. 

Wie gesagt. Solange der Boden des Grundgesetzes nicht verlassen wurde, liegt die Beweislast beim Ankläger.

&gt;&gt; Zumal die Aussage dass eine Partei die sich gewisser, barbarischer Mittel nicht bedient, einen Nachteil hat eigentlich als Allgemeinplatz gelten dürfte.

&gt; 'Nen Scheiss dürfte sie. Wenn du das behaupten willst, behaupte und belege es.

Ich unterstelle Dir jetzt zu Deinen Gunsten einfach mal dass Du mich falsch verstanden hast. Wenn wir Krieg gegen irgendwelche Terroristen führen, dabei aber gleichzeitig, und vernünftigerweise auf gewisse Waffen verzichten (wie ""Dörfer niederzubrennen"" etc.) dann ist das ein Nachteil in der Mittelwahl (weil echt weniger Optionen). Ich sehe keinen Grund warum ich so eine offensichtliche Folgerung noch groß belegen muss. Das heißt aber noch lange nicht dass ich den Einsatz solcher Mittel gut heiße.

&gt;&gt;  Als äußerster Maßstab der nicht überschritten werden darf muß hier zunächst der Boden des Grundgesetzes herhalten.

An dieser Stelle, die Du in Deinem Zitat weggeschnitten hast, habe ich klar und offen benannt den Kontext gewechselt. Du versuchst mit Deiner Aneinenderreihung einen Zusammenhang herzustellen der so nicht besteht, da die Textabschnitte klar durch ein Zitat Deines Beitrags getrennt werden. Du stellst dabei zwischen meinen Aussagen eine Verbindung her die nicht besteht. 

Das ist unterste Schublade.

&gt;&gt;  Da halte ich es für richtig, dass sich der Fachbereit erstmal vor das Personal stellt. Feuern geht immer noch, und Internet-Shitstorms sind selten ein guter Ratgeber für Handlungen.

&gt;Uh, das ist mir schon klar. Aber wenn dieser Typ in einem Artikel, wo dieses seine Aussagen nichtmal benannt werden, nur so vage faselt, dass ""Unsinn"" über ihn verbreitet wird, scheint mir das nicht nach Einsicht oder Jokus. 

Der von Dir verlinkte taz-Artikel (auf den sich meine Aussage *nicht* bezieht) benutzt das von dir zitierte Wort ""Unsinn"" nicht. Das Wort ""Jokus"" bezieht sich auf die Affäre Hunt und Du machst nicht klar woher diese Aussage kommt. Du legst mir Worte in den Mund.



 &gt;&gt;  Man nimmt ja auch keinen pöbelnden Mob als Ausgangspunkt, sondern schaut in Ruhe nach, warum es diesen Mob gibt und ob er einen Tag später immer noch Ausgangspunkte hat.

&gt; Hat man hier aber wohl nicht gemacht.

&gt;&gt;    Eine linke Studentengruppe kritisiert diese Äußerungen. Der Leiter des historischen Instituts der HU fordert Lehrende und Studierende nun auf, Baberowski gegen die kritischen Studenten zu verteidigen.

&gt;&gt;    ""Das ist ein Hammer"", sagt Johannes Schott, ein Sprecher der Studentengruppe IYSSE. ""Uns die Kritik zu verbieten geht zu weit."" Am Dienstag schrieben Vertreter von IYSSE, der Jugendorganisation der trotzkistischen Partei für soziale Gleichheit, einen offenen Brief an die Leitung der Hochschule. Darin fordern sie vor allem die Rückkehr zur sachlichen Kritik. Die HU-Leitung äußert sich zu dem Schreiben auf Nachfrage der taz nicht, weil sie die Vorwürfe als ""haltlos"" erachtet, so ein Sprecher.

&gt; Der ""pöbelnde Mob"", der eine Rückkehr zu sachlicher Kritik fordert, und eiskalt in sehr ernsten Bedenken ignoriert wird?

Falscher Kontext. Es geht um Tim Hunt. Mir ist nicht klar warum Mr. Schott such dazu geäussert hat.

&gt;&gt; Als zweiter Punkt ist (eher im Falle Münkler, der mir sonst nicht weiter bekannt ist)

&gt; Das ist ja alles schön und fein, beantwortet aber meine Fragen zu Baberowski nicht.

Da hier der Kontext gewechselt wurde, spielt das keine Rolle. 

&gt;&gt;  gleichzeitig damit rechnen müssen, dass jeder Übertritt eines Tabus öffentlich seziert wird

&gt; Man kann ALLES ""Tabubruch"" nennen. Was ist schon Verherrlichung von Kriegsverbrechen als schnöder ""Tabubruch""? Wann darf man endlich mal wieder ein fescher Nazi sein, sind 70 Jahre in den Bart nuscheln und auf Mensch machen nicht Opfer genug?

Hier geht es aber klar zunächst mal um ungenannte Tabubrüche (die auch durchaus milder ausfallen können) und dann im Kontext wohl eher um Sexismus und den sogenannten ""Herrenwitz"". Wenn Du das auf eine Stufe mit dem Holocaust stellen wilst, nur zu. Mir ist aber noch nicht klar wie Du millionenfache Ermordung von Menschen nur aufgrund ihrer Religion mit schlichten verbalen Entgleisungen gleichsetzen willst, aber das wirst Du dann ja erläutern wenn es eine Extrasession in Nürnberg für den Brüderle gibt.

Im Übrigen scheint es mir in der causa Münkler sowieso eher um Sexismus als um Geschichtsklitterung zu gehen. Aber erstmal die ganz große Keule rausholen.

&gt; Es gibt Vergewaltigungen, es gibt falsche Anschuldigungen von Vergewaltigung, trotzdem muß man ihnen nachgehen. Das eine kann nicht hinter dem anderen versteckt, der eine Fall nicht mit dem anderen entschuldigt werden. 

Auch hier werden plötzlich Straftaten aufgekarrt wenn es in *meinem* Posting schlicht um Tabubruch ging. Ich empfehle Dir dringend, verbal abzurüsten. Nicht jede Diskussion muss gleich Straftaten und Völkermord beinhalten.

&gt; Und man merkt sich irgendwie auch nur die ""shitstorms"", die durchaus auch existierende positive korrektive Wirkung dieser Wahrnehmung, dieser Überwachung durch die Massen, wenn man so will, wird einfach stillschweigend ignoriert. Hach ja, ist ja echt problematisch, wenn man nicht mehr einfach nur so konsequenzfrei von oben seine Gülle über Leuten ausbreiten kann, die gefälligst wehrlos zu sein haben.

Können. Aber nicht müssen, und nicht jedem Shitstorm muss sogleich entsprochen werden, sondern es darf auch mal nach ""entlastenden"" Gründen für den ""Angeklagten"" recherchiert werden, und in dem von mir zitiertem Fall ist das nicht passiert. Aber is klar, ""die da oben"" und so, und wehrlosigkeit ist halt nur für kleine Leute, ein verbaler Lynchmob würde doch nie über wehrlose Leute herfallen.

Mal einen Schritt zurück, gibt es jetzt zwei Möglichkeiten. Nummer eins ist dass Du willentlich Aussagen falsch zusammenfasst, unfähig bist überhaupt mal zu überlegen was der Andere gemeint haben könnte und dass Dir in Deinem heiligen Zorn egal ist was am Wegesrand liegen bleibt.

Nummer zwei (und bei Weitem von mir präferiert) ist dass Du mich missverstanden hast und dann möglicherweise in der Hitze etwas zu weit ausgeholt hast. Da ist es mit einem sorry getan und wir reden nicht drüber, kommt im Internet halt mal vor ohne Mimik und so.

null,false,chetnix,SERB,Serbia,null,"BANJA LUKA - The deputies of the National Assembly of the Republic of Srpska (RS) this evening adopted a decision to call a referendum on High Representative-imposed decisions, particularly on the Court and Prosecution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The initiative to consider this decision was sent to NARS on  the 2 July by the President of the Republic of Srpska Milorad Dodik. The referendum question should read, ""Do you support an unconstitutional and unauthorized imposition of laws by the High Representative of the international community in BiH, particularly to impose the law on the Court and the Prosecutor's Office and the implementation of their decisions on the territory of the Republic of Srpska?"".

From 76 present, ""FOR"" voted 45 deputies, while 31 abstained. The same number of delegates voted in the same way for the two proposed conclusions.

President of the National Assembly of the Republic of Srpska Nedeljko Cubrilovic said today that there are constitutional and legal framework, as well as political justification for the maintenance of the republican referendum as a democratic form of expression of citizens on the reform of the judicial system. Cubrilovic, during the debate at a special session of the Srpska National Assembly, said that the referendum is one of the most important forms of expression of citizens in accordance with international law and emphasized that the republic referendum and the decision to be derived from it will not jeopardize the integrity and sovereignty.

He said that holding a referendum on the Court and the Prosecutor's Office does not threaten any international agreement, not even Dayton Peace Agreement.

Cubrilovic pointed out that there are many facts that the Court of BiH partially approached the prosecution of perpetrators of war crimes, the Prosecution had not filed an indictment for a number of crimes to the Serbs, but also against Croats, and that mainly before the Court of BiH sentenced many crimes against Bosniaks.

He called on the international community and all those of goodwill in BiH to criticism and instead the message of conditionality to support the referendum as a democratic form of expression of the will of the citizens on all issues relevant to the community.",null,0,null,1437000340,null,0,1437000911,0,ct4pdv0,null,t3_3dfrso,null,t1_ct4pdv0,null,t3_3dfrso,null,null,null,1440477947,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

But why is it that europe is the cradle of modern civilization and prosperity? Because for the very most time, there have been many small independent ""countries"" in europe. Thus, the governments have always been in competition against each other, and to attract taxpayers, governments had to offer good service like rights for individuals, a good legal service, low taxes, etc. (concepts like property rights were ""invented"" in europe before anywhere else, because of that).

Yes, there has been war, but not because there was no overall european political structure. But because some crazy politians wanted to take over europe and create that structure. Now we are setting up the stage for  polititians to rule over europe on our own. It makes me really said.

Anectodal information is useless when you have polls that prove otherwise. If you could prove that the poll should not be trusted, then maybe. Even then, I'd still be suspicious of any kind of anecdotal information (unless you have 3.6 Million anecdotes - one per person in the country) as its most likely simply a ""statistical bubble"".

Eurobarometer is a very reputable organization, too - part of the European Commission. I trust them more than any Portuguese (or Croatian) statistics organization. Also, that document you linked is more than 2 years old.

[You're free to check the details of the poll](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_publ_en.pdf).

According to the annex, The Croatian interviews were made by an institution called HENDAL (under supervision from Eurobarometer), maybe you know of it?

The interview process seems to follow all rules for such a process (random selection, in-person, native language, etc). In total, there were 1003 interviews in Croatia between 31/04/2014 and 9/06/2014. According to the tables in the Annex, ""50% for"" has a 3.1% statistical margin, for a confidence of 95%.

That means than there 5 in 100 chance that the real number of people in Croatia who agree with the question is outside the range of 46.9% and 53.1%.

[With some math (well, in this case a Javascript calculator)](https://www.mccallum-layton.co.uk/tools/statistic-calculators/confidence-interval-for-proportions-calculator/), you can calculate the statistical margin for 99% confidence, which is 4.07%. So there is 1 in 100 chance that the real percentage is outside 45.93% and 54.07%.

In the same vein, you can calculate the margin for 99.9% confidence, which is 5.19%. So there is a 1 in 1000 chance that the real percentage is outside 44.81% and 55.19%.

So, unless you find something wrong with the actual interviewing process (in terms of random selection and such), I hope you're not going to argue that the science of mathematics/statistics is wrong, right?",null,0,null,1437000466,null,0,1437001377,0,ct4pgjz,null,t3_3de5p9,null,t1_ct4pgjz,null,t1_ct4lllq,null,null,null,1437884552,null,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1,null

Hadžiomerović: Bosniak Delegates will raise the issue of protection of vital national interest

However, for the parliamentary decision to come into force, it must be confirmed by the RS Council of Peoples, but will not get the approval of the Bosniak Members, the agency Fena stated.

The head of the club Mujo Hadžiomerović confirmed to the agency that the Bosniak delegates raise the issue of protection of vital national interest to the decision on the referendum in the RS on the Court and the Prosecutor's Office and pointed out that the Bosniak club will use all legal means to challenge the decision on the referendum because, as stated, it causes ""tremendous damage"".

During two days of sharp parliamentary debate, the opposition in RS emphasized that even they are not satisfied with the work of state judicial institutions, they are against the manipulation of citizens by this referendum, as they say, by Dodik and the RS authorities.

Dodik decision on a referendum is called historic, and the opposition believes that the RS authorities it serves as a means of pressure on the international representatives in the continuation of structural dialogue and that the referendum will not be, as it is not held even in 2011, concludes Fena.

Suljagić: Adoption of a decision on a referendum in the RS is a call to war!

Vice President of the Democratic Front and the Deputy Defense Minister Emir Suljagić told Dnevni Avaz that, without a doubt, it is an assault on the sovereignty and integrity of BiH.

- Milorad Dodik has obviously started the process for the consequences of which I'm not sure he's ready. There is no doubt that this decision is a call to war - said Suljagić for ""Avaz"" portal.

- At the moment the ball is in the international community. If the Office of the High Representative (OHR) and the international community do not do what they were ordered by the Dayton Peace Agreement, I am sure that in this country there are people and facilities, and institutions that will be ready to defend its integrity and sovereignty - considered Suljagić.

He once again reiterated that the RS president and SNSD leader Milorad Dodik was ""obviously ready to challenge with organized mass violence to stay in power.""

- I do not know to what or to whom Dodik would account if there is violence. And, as I said, scheduling the date of this referendum will undoubtedly provoke violence. If this decision is not changed, unfortunately, this will happen - said Suljagić.

*The new deal that cuts pensions, raises taxes, has huge surpluse targets and automatic austerity if goals aren't met does not impose austerity. On the contrary, it avoids it. (I guess we we've allways been at war with Ozeania after all.)

I'm no IR expert, but the whole industrialized world, not just Europe, has avoided significant wars since World War II.  I'd chalk some of that up to infrastructure damage being more-important than it once was, some of it to international trade being more-important, and some of it due to resources (aside from maybe oil) being harder to capture than when control of agricultural land was the primary thing.

I think that cheap travel and mass media and the spread of common language and urbanization and travel moving people off their parent's farms will tend to facilitate borders steadily breaking down, and that the diplomat's signature on some paper is more a function of that than the other way around.

But, hey, I could easily be wrong too, and I'm sure that there's some positive feedback in both directions.  I have a really hard time seeing the UK, France, and Germany fighting for a long, long time to come, though.

Allora, il sidro è una bevanda alcolica fermentata (come vino, birra e idromele), dove l'elemento fermentabile è il succo di mele.

Non tutte le mele sono buone a far succo, e difficilmente avremo voglia di ridurre personalmente in polpa e succo una quintalata di mele, quindi la soluzione più semplice è recuperare il detto succo da brick o bottiglie, possibilmente dal discount per evitare costi stratosferici.

Tipicamente chi vive in veneto ha vita più facile perché il succo di mela è particolarmente popolare.

C'è un unico caveat: evitare prodotti che abbiano aggiunte di stabilizzanti, ovvero composti chimici che per l'appunto impediscono le fermentazioni, e qui si va a prove ed errori.

Poi si trovano due tipi di succo, quello da mela e quello da concentrato. Alla fine vanno bene tutti e due, anche se spesso quello ottenuto da concentrato è più allungato, e quindi ha meno resa alcolica. Si puo' comunque aggiungere a posteriori zucchero o miele per compensare.

Per procedere alla fermentazione basta un normalissimo kit per fare la birra in casa, e si seguono più o meno le stesse tecniche.

Per sommi capi:

* sanitizzare tutto l'equipaggiamento con metabisolfito o simili
* riempire fermentatore con succo di mela eventualmente rinforzato
* misurare densità iniziale e verificare che sia quella programmata
* aggiungere lievito secco (vanno bene quelli da birra ""alta fermentazione"", oppure da vino bianco, ma per la carità di bacco non usate il lievito del pane)
* aspettare la fine della fermentazione (~ 15 gg)
* verificare che la densità finale sia quella attesa
* travasare delicatamente per togliere i fondi
* imbottigliare aggiungendo a ogni bottiglia 4-5 grammi di zucchero per rendere il sidro frizzante. (Rifermentazione in bottiglia)
* aspettare 15 gg perché il tutto si stabilizzi in gusto
* ???
* PROFIT

per il resto c'è /r/Homebrewing 

Salute!

Since Gysi, and normally i like him, points the GDR out it should be noted that the eastern part of Germany is catching up on the West with all the funding recieved. Obviously many industries in eastern Germany were unable to compete and died but not because they got treated unfairly they just were less competetiv.

When Norwegians go to parties abroad, by the time everyone else figures they're drunk enough for the party to calm down, we want to go out to party and get drunk. When the clubs closes we wonder why everyone is heading home, and want to go along with them to continue the drinking.

Read into something called statistics. Because the answer is ""Yes"", as long as the 1003 people were chosen completely at random.

Again, I'll repeat myself (and this is mathematics). Assuming those 1003 people were chosen completely at random (and according to the Eurobarometer report they were, they detail exactly how they chose the people for the interviews), with a 50% observed result, they can represent *ANY* Population with a margin of 5.19% for 99.9% confidence.

This means that those 1003 randomly chosen people, of which 50% answered ""Yes"", represent **ANY** population, with a 1 in a 1000 chance of the real ""Yes"" result being outside the range of 44.81% and 55.19%.

If you do not believe what I am saying, then you should either study mathematics, or/and prove it wrong and get a few Nobel prizes to your name. You'd probably have to prove most of what we know in mathematics is wrong, though.

The difference for your anecdote, is that your circle of friends/acquaintances is the complete opposite of *random* sampling. At best, all it could be used for would be to calculate an estimate of what people who know you think. Therefore, it's useless, statistically.

&gt;Also, that poll information is 1 year old too.

So it's more recent than a 2 year old document (that, by the way, never gave concrete numbers of how many people believed the EU wasn't a good choice - even if only 10% did, it would still have made sense to release such a document)...

- les blondes aux yeux bleus (vos blagues sur la race aryenne ne sont pas drôles) ou yeux verts

- et enfin, la fessée, quand donnée sur femme consentante. Vous, les français, de part votre éducation catholique, vous considérez la fessée comme une punition. Nous, les protestants, sommes plutôt contre les punitions physiques, culturellement parlant, et nous voyons la fessée comme un acte sexuel.
Attention, il ne s'agit pas de blesser ou d'humilier sa partenaire, je hais cela. Non non, la fessée est vraiment un acte sexuel magnifique. Ce qui se passe: les fesses sont une zone érogène, et une ex m'avait expliqué qu'il y'a une connexion directe au clitoris (selon elle) si on frappe comme il faut.

\- Measures proposed by Global Witness:

* Importing countries in Europe enforce the EU Timber Regulation against all companies that have placed CAR wood or derived products on the EU market since
March 2013.
* The EU suspends its timber trade deal with CAR, the so-called Voluntary Partnership
Agreement.
* France ends all grants, subsidies or technical support of CAR’s industrial logging
sector.
* The Chinese government introduces a law banning illegal timber imports and cuts all trade links to CAR's logging industry.
* The international community supports the introduction of a moratorium on all industrial logging operations in CAR and the establishment of a Forest Sector Review Committee to investigate the financing of armed conflict, illegality and corruption in
the sector.
* The UN Panel of Experts examines the links between the timber industry and trade
with the financing of armed groups.

On est tout à fait d'accord, tout est une question d'équilibre.

Le problème de la France, c'est que notre système a tous les attributs classiques du régime parlementaire et que De Gaulle y a ajouté, par dessus, un Président qui n'est contrebalancé par rien d'autre que les élections tous les 7 ans (puis 5 ans). Tout en donnat à ce Président une légitimité électorale supérieure au Parlement puisque lui seul est élu en son nom propre par le peuple toute entier.

Yea. They have 180% debt/gdp ratio, we have 130%. And still, we pay more in interest than Greece does.  
  
It all depends on european growth, really. We don't have a Syriza/Podemos effect here, so the vast majority of people support center/right or center/left parties, so there won't be a deep debt restructuring, unless europe does so for other countries as well.

Borrow from your local bank, use it to buy a VW CC. And see what happens when you tell them that.

Don't be surprised when they have a right to seize your personal assets no matter if its small.

Anybody who thinks that they can borrow tons of money and somehow just say they can't pay and get to keep EVERYTHING. Is kidding themselves and know it.  Thats what the €50 billion privatization sale was in the 3rd bailout, was for. 

People who came here with an idealized idea of bankruptcy, forgets that national debts never get written off unless its voluntary. The debt is never written off. And in a private bankruptcy, assets of the company is liquidated(given to the person/company/institution they owe money to) or sold off in a fire sale to repay creditors. So people can be offended if greece has to sell so much of their assets/heritage/public property. But it happens anyway in a regular company bankruptcy.

There is NO, regular bankruptcy for national governments where the country then has zero debts and they get to keep everything. 

The only thing you might be thinking of is a debt moratorium which Argentina and Russia used and the debt was eventually paid off. NOT WRITTEN OFF.

1. Because the party is the minority right now? They can't do anything? They have not held power since 07. Why should they have to do the job of the party in power? And more importantly, if its so important, then why doesn't your country do it?

2. Because its legal through and through now. Literally the only way to make it illegal now is through a consitutional ammendment. It requires 2/3 of all U.S. voters to say yes to it. That's not happening.

3. There's no way I can persuade you that some people see it not as removing women's rights but empowering a child's right to life. Most republicans are willing to accept rape, incest and medical problems. Only the fringe ones get heard and they don't get elected.

4. True, they don't. But you didn't call the Democratic party ""batshit insane"".

5. Alright, then how is it the Republican party's fault when they haven't been the majority since 08? ACA was created out of the first Democratic supermajority in like 40 years. The Republicans have not had free reign since the Marshall plan was still going. And no it isn't, but there are benefits to our former system, like not having to wait months at a time to get a checkup.

6. You don't seem to get that when the rich have money, they invest. When they invest, it boosts the economy. When the economy is boosted, more business is formed, which meets the same tax revenue. It's a tested and true system. The jobs are a wonderful bonus.

7. Iraq had heavy support from Democrats (Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton). And Vietnam was started by Democrats. In fact, the president which ended the war was a Republican. Nixon. Nixon also was the president to formally recognize China, which neither Kennedy or Johnson did before him.

Since pensioners don't want pension cuts (in real value), the Greek government has to raise the value of the Pension back to 500€ Since they don't have Euros and can't get loans they have to print more Drachmas.

It's a bit more complicated than that.

In the short term what matters are the fiscal targets set by the deal. How big a primary deficit/surplus is Greece expected to have each year going forward and how much is Europe covering.

Longer term the net present value value of the debt and payment schedule will be important. The Eurozone loans to Greece already stretch until 2065 and at relatively low interest rates, so the value of the debt is less than if it had to be refinanced every year.

The way it worked out in 2012 the debt would have been sustainable if Greece, after the initial phase, ran a 3.5% primary surplus every year and grew at 1% a year until forever. To smooth out the ups and downs they should be able to borrow from the open market.

&gt; Because I spent many years during my previous life as an academic researching game theory, some commentators rushed to presume that as Greece’s new finance minister I was busily devising bluffs, stratagems and outside options, struggling to improve upon a weak hand.

&gt; Nothing could be further from the truth.

&gt; If anything, my game-theory background convinced me that it would be pure folly to think of the current deliberations between Greece and our partners as a bargaining game to be won or lost via bluffs and tactical subterfuge.

&gt; The trouble with game theory, as I used to tell my students, is that it takes for granted the players’ motives. In poker or blackjack this assumption is unproblematic. But in the current deliberations between our European partners and Greece’s new government, the whole point is to forge new motives.

&gt; ...

&gt; As finance minister of a small, fiscally stressed nation lacking its own central bank and seen by many of our partners as a problem debtor, I am convinced that we have one option only: to shun any temptation to treat this pivotal moment as an experiment in strategizing and, instead, to present honestly the facts concerning Greece’s social economy, table our proposals for regrowing Greece, explain why these are in Europe’s interest, and reveal the red lines beyond which logic and duty prevent us from going.",null,0,null,1437006697,null,0,false,0,ct4t1ns,null,t3_3dfbhs,null,t1_ct4t1ns,null,t3_3dfbhs,null,null,null,1437887209,null,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7,null

Until then Greece has to pay back a lot of debt that is not owned by the Eurozone. Until January 2016, Greece has to pay treasury bill holders 14.8 billion Euro. This year the IMF wants 5 billion Euro from Greece, and the ECB would like to get back 6.6 billion as well.

null,false,AdamHicks,null,null,null,"The cause of all this is basically a mix of unhealthy economic structure, corruption and foreign interests. 

Firstly, the public sector was huge and the private sector was not competitive. Our previous governments have been actively sabotaging the private sector by passing laws that have gradually diminished our agriculture and industries, while leaving services as the only viable option. This is why tourism is the only healthy part of our economy. At the same time, the public sector grew out of proportions with many unnecessary employees.

BUT. While all this was bad, our economy's stats were not all that bad compared to other countries. However, our PM G.Papandreou decided on 2010 to drag us into a financial program composed by the IMF, the ECB and the EU by presenting them tweaked (worse than the actual) economic stats. The support package provided was mainly used to pay previous debts and the economic reforms imposed created the current situation that has been going downwards ever since.

So who's to blame? There's no denying our governments hold major responsibility for this. The people of Greece are to blame to for trusting the same corrupt faces over and over again for decades, despite the various scandals that have come to surface throughout the decades. The economic elite is to blame too for being in direct control of the media and in constant interweaving with the major political parties. The European leaders are to blame too since they knew, at least since 2012 when we had to receive the second 'care' package, that this policy would only deepen our recession and extend our need for economic assistance. And now they've blackmailed us into the same corrosive formula.

Now about the Euro, it is clear we should have never gotten in the EU. Our then PM K.Simitis got us into the union by presenting false data about our economy. This was against the interest of the Greek people and we realised it the very first day. Prices got up as much as 500% on some products while the average was around 300%. This would not be a problem if the wages received a similar boost, which they did not. Wages were simply converted from Drachmas to Euros and this was a major hit to the buying power of the working class. In short, yes, Greeks would be better off without the Euro.

At this point, exiting the EU seems like the only realistic solution. A hard one too. Many people who are against austerity realise that and are afraid of it. That's probably the reason why our current government did not have the guts to put it on the table.

You're not paying attention. Let me break this to you. Soon... very soon, our national languages will be in the same place as Spain's Catalan or Galego. 

Mobility is increasing immensely within the EU. People can't afford to know the languages of all places they go to, so they just use English. I know people who have been for over 5 years, some close to 10, in one country, and never bothered to learned the language (which I personally find that really wrong, but they claim to be busy and that they might move and don't feel like they need it that much). 

More and more restaurants have menus in English. More and more universities provide classes in English. 

Pretty much everyone under 40 speaks some English. Pretty much everyone under 30 has pretty decent English. Pretty much everyone under 20 will be almost fluent in English.

null,false,mancunian,UKGB,United Kingdom,null,"We may have low unemployment in Britain but due to self inflicted austerity (we have our own printing press and can borrow in sterling for next to nothing) we actually have a higher deficit than when the Conservatives came to power.

This is because we shrunk our economy. We also have a cost of living crisis with alarming numbers of in work households relying on churches and charities for food aid (a very rare situation before this government's regime).

The government recently had to change the definition of child poverty to hide the fact that it's increasing.

Wages have yet to recover to anywhere near their pre-crisis peak. Many new jobs are precarious (zero hours contracts). As a public sector worker my wages will have fallen by 13% in real terms by the end of the decade.

Our NHS is being dismantled so that it can be [sold back](https://www.opendemocracy.net/ournhs/richard-grimes/government-moves-to-consider-nhs-user-charges) to us. There's been a number of scandalous privatisations in which the government sold productive assets like The Royal Mail at below market value. Interestingly the banks that advised the government on the share prices made a tidy profit flipping their shares in addition to the fee they were paid.

We could have used our low deficit and interest rates to borrow and invest in growing our economy. Instead Osborne choked our swift recovery with austerity before injecting stimulus in the runup to the election. This made it look to the public like we'd been given a virtuous recovery based on austerity and not on scary government debt.

Now they're in again they're pumping up the austerity at a rate we've never seen before. Many like myself believe this is a scorched earth policy as it will be a lot harder to rebuild our public sector than it is to just cut at budgets like edward scissor hands.

The real kicker though. The only protected group are the pensioners. Their welfare makes up the vast majority of our welfare bill yet it is 'triple locked' (guaranteed to rise annually by the highest of three measures of inflation).

Austerity in a crisis is the economic equivalent of bloodletting. I've yet to see any economist show an example of contractionary expansion in a modern economy. If it worked, I'd be all for it.

To get back to the topic of the thread, Angela Merkel knows this. She does not want a force to the right of the CDU leading German politics. She'd rather wait five or ten years until the general acceptance rises instead of handing the mic over to the populists. 

This is the smart move to make. I know that the average 20ish activist has no temper for calculated decisions, but I don't want the AfD see winning elections because things like gay marriage drive people away from mainstream conservative parties.

Crime is a different issue because it is linked to more than just poverty, there are also issues of biology and possibly genetics involves. Problems of parenting as well as trauma. Welfare states tend to get rid of most crime which is actually caused by poverty, but leaves society to deal with the other kinds of crime - the want-crime not the need-crime so to speak.

&gt; Anyway with my basic income idea, there would be no such issue in the first place. A basic income would fulfil those basic needs you talk about. 

Indeed, although I fail to see were exactly that isn't welfare, but that's just definitions. In fact the idea is so good that it used by socialist theoreticians in what could be called ""state socialism"", a theoretical system where the state holds a certain percentage of every company and the workers of that company own the rest (mostly a 49/51 or a 50/50 split). There are different companies competing with each other in the same markets which would generate competition. The profits would be split between the state and the workers, and if a worker was more important or worked more they'd get more, but always a base income. So this means that workers also would have an incentive to work harder because they aren't all getting the same. And finally, something that makes this idea just really freakin' elegant is that the workers of a companies could decide for themselves after what system they want the profits to be distrubeted and companies to be run. It's basically simulated capitalism.

While that theory is quite elegant, I don't see the ""final"" socialism having a monetary economy, more like social contract that people work and will only consume what they need - which of course would mean training greed out of generations of humans.",null,0,null,1437011095,null,0,false,0,ct4vgf0,null,t3_3dbwe3,null,t1_ct4vgf0,null,t1_ct4u2vc,null,null,null,1437888874,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Its not like this is happening in the dead of winter, its harvest season and ariculture is still a thing in greece. Also greece is not so poor that they cannot afford rice and beens for the next year to avoid stravation, people who live on less than a dollar a day can keep from starving, greece isnt that bad off. 

Medicine will be a problem there is no way around that, if europe chooses to cut off all aid some may die. There are aid organiziations that will likely step in and help stem the crisis. 

Greece is not samolia, on its own currency it would be able to grow and recover. The tourism industry will be strong, local buisnesses will be able to start more easily, and even poor tax collection can be counteracted with inflation.

In the flat plain areas, like around Larissa, it would be possible to aggregate and modernize farms to compete on a similar level with Spanish farms.

null,false,wadcann,UNSA,United States of America,null,"It's not clear to me -- though I doubt that I have the familiarity that y'all do with it -- that at least what happened here is a good example of that.

The EU is putting a lot of money in.  It knows that a right-wing government can be productive, since there are a number of successful ones, and so it doesn't want to dump a bunch of money it and have it turn into left-wing projects that don't produce a return.

On the *other* hand, outside of the EU needing to lend a lot of money, does it typically try to modify governments?  I mean, there aren't any current far-left governments in Europe, but it's not clear to me that there's majority interest in far-left economies in any European country.  Certainly Europe is further center-left than is the US.

I'm trying to think why it wouldn't be possible for a far-left European government to arise.  I'm guessing that the EU places restrictions on trade barriers, and if a far-left economy cannot produce goods competitively, it cannot rely on economic restrictions to generate redistribution...though it could do so via taxation.

Freedom of movement means that it's hard to pin someone wealthy into the country and extract a lot of money from them, since they'll just go somewhere else in Europe (unless the EU permits taxation of people that have moved somehow or taxation on citizenship switch).  I guess that could be seen as right...but the alternative to that seems to be Berlin Wall-style situations.

I dunno, I haven't seen mechanisms that would *block* left-wing parties from coming to power.

I actually tend to blame (and to be fair, I'm mostly-fiscally-right, so maybe there's some bias talking) the left for the far left being on a steady decline for decades now.  It doesn't feel like there's been any realistic adaptation to the times.  When I've said something like ""well, if you want to get a lot of people behind a far left government, you need to provide arguments compelling to a national populace why they wouldn't run into the same economic problems that past governments have hit"", the response that I've gotten multiple times is on the order of ""well, *this* time we'd implement a pure Marxism"".  The problem is, that same line was alive a long time back, including in the Cuban revolution, and it's not clear to me that asserting that does much to repair the economic deficiencies.

The rise of social democracies and the welfare state has cut somewhat into some of the selling points of the far left.  What kind of response has been made to that?

There hasn't been correlation with economic success in building a society that is further-left than the current mainstream, whereas a number of very-economically-successful economies are further-right than the current mainstream.  There are real theoretical arguments in favor of a more-left-wing approach simply working better -- maybe people could be more motivated if they felt themselves to be as much owners as anyone else, maybe there are feedback loops that waste potential in a right environment, that sort of thing -- but it's hard to ask for everyone to jump to a far left environment if you can't sell people on some correlation showing the society becoming long-term-more-appealing-to-the-majority as things move left.

A lot of the terminology that shows up from the left feels very dated, and it bothers me that there isn't a serious attempt to make arguments for a far-left economy translated to mainstream economic terms.  The symbols and images tend to date to the Industrial Era.  It's just...not being developed.  The few funded and productive outlets of left-wing opinion that I run into (like wsws.org) tend to complain and try to outrage rather than list compelling alternatives.

Now, I'm not blaming people for not producing that.  *I'm* not doing so, because I don't see far-left systems as very viable.  But unless someone can identify problems in the current system, provide a plausible alternative, and then express that in an accessible way, I don't see a lot changing.

Democracy had to do that with aristocracy.  More-democratic systems worked, and worked well, and provided pragmatic benefits.  You didn't need to reach some democratic threshold where suddenly everything would start working much better.  That is the bar that I expect a new system proposing a major societal change to be able to meet.  If someone tells me that sharia law is really great and makes a society better, I want to be able to look at some country where I really am happy with the results that is *closer* to sharia law than my own country.

And I think that it's because the left hasn't been rising up to this bar of demonstrating that moves left are viable that the left has become less-influential, not because the EU is suppressing them.

If you want it  to be objective in  comparison, don't  leave out the numbers in your second example and impute ""victim"" rhetoric. 


So to make it equally right.

1991 -  1994;  Bosnia declares dependence.  Massive conflict in Bosnia, where 33% of Serbs revolt against secession f and want to remain in union with de-facto Serbia (Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia). Population gets displaced in fear of reprisals or forcefully and by end of war Muslim  had 5 times more civilian victims and got displaced (ethnically  cleansed ) the most. 

1996 - Dayton agreement.  Serbian 33% gets its entity called Republika Srpska; 

*******

1989 - 1999 ,  **90% of Albanians** that live Kosovo and want to secede from Serbia **[through peaceful referendum] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovan_independence_referendum,_1991)** . In 1998 violent conflicts starts between Serbia and Kosovo A;banians. Serbia loses  the war and majority of Serb population leave Kosovo fearing reprisals

2008 - Kosovo gets independence, with granted now, 95% of Albanians, with most of Serbians being displaced

Although I agree; if significant number of an ethnic group doesn't  want to live in certain union they should secede. So, both RKS and Kosovo should be allow to secede. Right?? WRONG! Because, every second Serbian I know, who is pro RSK (Republika Srpska Krajina) independence is also supporter of ""Kosovo is part of Serbia""

So, Serbian logic in 90s (and for most, today) 

1989 - 90% of Albanians in Kosovo wants independence

Nope, can't do.
*******
1991 - Serbians in Croatia (20%)  and Bosnia (33%) want independence

Yup. Lets start some shit.

and when this logic  turns against them, it is injustice. Typical

edit: fancy lines

To downvoters. Palko bre, smirite se. I agree. If ethic  entity wants to secede they should be able to do so via national referendum.

null,false,LordGravewish,PORT,Portugal,null,"Depends a lot on the system. I'm not sure about Greece, but for example, Portugal uses multi-seat constituencies, where MPs are elected through a closed party-list.

Basically, [each constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_the_Republic_(Portugal\)#Distribution_by_constituency) has a different number of MPs that they elect depending on population.

Each party builds, for each constituency, a list of MPs they want to elect, and give each MP a priority. These lists are public, and known well in advance of the election.

The [De Hondt method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method) is used to divide each constituency's mandates among the multiple parties depending on election results for that constituency. Then, the party members at the top of each party list are given the mandates.

For example, if Party A has the following list for a certain constituency:

&gt; John

&gt; Bill

&gt; Jane

And they get 2 seats for that constituency, John and Bill will get the mandate, while Jane won't.

Once they have the seat, they cannot be removed from the seat. MPs are allowed to vote how they like, but parties have mechanisms that allow them to request a vote within party lines (and tend to use it for any important votes, especially the governing parties).

A MP that disregards the party lines multiple times (or a single time on a very important vote) may be kicked from the party. This does not mean they lose their seat, just that they will not be part of that party, and therefore won't be in that party's list during the next elections. If they want to run, they must run with a different party, or create their own. Yes, independents may not run - but creating a new party is a very easy process (they just need to collect 7500 valid signatures from registered voters, but that's very easy to do in a country with 9 million registered voters).

This approach has a ton of disadvantages (it makes MPs less accountable, and the party system much more important, as the order of MPs in the party lists depend on how much they are liked by the party, and it's hard to get elected if you're not high on the list, especially in smaller parties - so MPs tend to prioritize the party instead of their electorate).

I'd be in favour of electoral reform into smaller electoral circles (for example, circles of 5 mandates, instead of having circles as large as 47 mandates in larger cities) that are closer to their constituency (while still avoiding most issues with FPTP), and away from closed party-lists ([open lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_list), or something more extreme like [STV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) or [MMPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation)).

null,false,iliveintexas,UNSA,United States of America,null,"**Barack Obama**: 44th President of the United States; Democrat. Took office in 2008. Won re-election in 2012. His final term will end in 2016 (2 term limit on presidents). Prior to becoming President, he was a Junior Senator (for the U.S. Congress) from Illinois. Prior to that, a Illinois state senator (as in, for the state of Illinois).

**The Good**:

* Tackled health care through the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The Act was the most significant and transformative legislation passed in a generation (IMO). Eliminated unpopular restrictions on health insurance coverage (pre-existing conditions, policy maximums, extended coverage on certain conditions). Extended coverage to children under parents' plans. Instituted a mandate to purchase health care. Of course, this law isn't without it's controversy.

* Economic recovery on a national level. You can't give credit entirely to just the President, but he certainly made a lot of controversial decisions in 2009-2010 that have paid off well. However, much of the recovery has benefited the most wealthy. Wages have not improved; costs of living have gone up.

* Reduction of Foreign Policy: Obama has been more hesitant about commit the U.S. military/aid to foreign conflicts, due to the fall out from the Iraq War.

* Oversaw operation that killed of Osama bin Laden.

* Expansion of gay rights. Not entirely Obama's doing, but he has enabled the proper atmosphere in Washington to let this happen.

* Discontinued use of ""Enhanced Interrogation Techniques.""

* Started process to re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba.

**The Bad**:

* Continued many unpopular Bush policies (Gitmo, NSA mass surveillance, Patriot Act)

* Extra-judicial, secretive drone strikes. Although this is viewed as a successful tactic in the ""War on Terrorism,"" there's very little public oversight of this program and little accountability for how it's being used.

* Withdrew from Iraq too early. Iraq wasn't ready to go on it's own. There were a lot of wasted resources in training the Iraq army, building infrastructure that's not being used.

* Failure to hold large banks accountable for the role they played in causing the 2008 global financial crisis.

* Serious questions remain about the affordability of health care. Not to mention, Republicans have tried to gut this law at every opportunity.

* No progress made on campaign finance reform. In fact, political donations have become much less transparent since 2008 with Super Pacs.

**Neutral**:

* Reduction of deficit spending. Given the gravity of the 2008 financial crisis, it's difficult for me to blame him for nearly doubling our national debt, but I don't regard this as a positive point of his presidency.

&gt;Pensions expert Professor Platon Tinios, who works at the University of Piraeus in Athens, said there are countless exceptions to the rules, which allow some Greeks to retire as early as age 50. In many cases, workers are motivated to retire early to avoid the dismal, unstable job market.

&gt;What about the retirement age of 67? ""Hardly anyone who is retiring now is affected by the new retirement age,"" he said, noting that it could take a generation for the rules to take effect.

ho visto gli altri tuoi posts qua su Reddit, ho visto la tua pagina di GofundMe e mi permetto di darti un paio di consigli..

nella la pagina del tuo Gofundme scrivi che il tuo sogno fin da bambino e' sempre stato quello di trasferirti in Giappone, scrivi che il tuo piano sarebbe frequentare una scuola, poi l'universita' e poi scrivi che a quel punto il tuo sogno diverrebbe realta'.....|

in che senso scusa? qual'e' il tuo sogno esattamente? cosa pensi di trovare in Giappone che non puoi trovare in altri posti? che vuoi fare esattamente nella tua vita?

il tuo sogno e' solamente spostarti in Giappone? per fare cosa?

scrivi che hai usato tutti i soldi che avevi per le tasse universitarie, ma cmq pur di coronare il tuo sogno sei pronto a lasciare tutto (i soldi gia' spesi, gli studi che hai cominciato a fare, famiglia, amici etc etc)... non so come dirtelo ma mi sembra un po' na cazzata... 

da quello che scrivi non sembra tu abbia le idee chiare su quello che vuoi fare della tua vita... e ti assicuro che venire in Giappone non risolve di certo la situazione.

Vivo in Giappone da circa 6 anni ormai ed e' pieno qua di ragazzi e ragazze giovani che vengono con gli stessi progetti e speranze che hai te, frequentano una scuola piena di altri stranieri, lavoricchiano per mantenersi vita e qualche sfizio (con la student visa non puoi lavorare piu di 28 ore settimanali) e alla fine o non gli viene rinnovato il visto, o non vengono ammessi alla loro universita' preferita, devono tornare nel loro paese avendo speso un sacco di soldi e rimanendo con poco in mano...

ma poi, fondamentalmente, sei mai venuto in Giappone? almeno per vacanza? perche' se basi tutto questo tuo ""sogno"" su quello che vedi online, nei manga o anime, allora ti assicuro che il sogno finisce dopo 6 mesi o un anno che stai qua... mi sembra superfluo dirlo ma qua non e' tutto sushi, ramen e scolarette... esattamente com l'Italia non e' tutta pizza, pasta e mandolino...

Il consiglio che ti do io e' di continuare l'universita' in Italia, metti da parte dei soldi lavorando, studia un po' la lingua per conto tuo, e quando puoi vieni una o due volte in vacanza in Giappone (non solamente Tokyo) e vedi se la cosa ti attira e l'ambiente ti piace. Inoltre una volta laureato sarai molto piu ""appetibile"" per le varie aziende giapponesi e sara' piu semplice trovare lavoro...

non vorrei sembrare retorico ma sei ancora giovane e ne hai di tempo per capire se il Giappone e' il posto per te o no.

Una mia considerazione personale inoltre e' sulla moralita' nel farsi ""sponsorizzare"" i propri sogni o desideri con campagne di crowdfunding...la vedo un po' una scorciatoia, usare i soldi degli altri per farti i cazzi tuoi.. 

per carita', ognuno fa quello che gli pare, ma non avrebbe piu senso sbattersi e mettere da parte i soldi se quello e' proprio ""il sogno della tua vita""?

ovviamente non mi riferisco solo al tuo caso, e' un discorso un po' generale....

cmq se ti servono info scrivimi in privato senza problemi

&gt; retirement age raised

when you have 25% unemployment, retirement is not competing with the active population on the labor market. You could say that it will help on the long run but the longer that level of unemployment, which means no controbution to pension fund, last, the less the whole retirement system is possible. 

The whole debate about the retirement age is ridiculous : with their economy, the senior greeks can't go into retirement as they won't be able to live with their pension anyway. And those who indeed went into retirement at 55 can't go back into work even if their pensions were cut to a level where they have no choice : there is just not any job for them.

In the end, they are the measures theu eurogroup wanted because they will be able to go back to their voters and tell them :""you see these greeks cheaters are going to finally pay some tax! These lazy greeks are no longer going to retire at 55!""

As far as I know it is completely the opposite.

Government of Turkey is more eager for a solution because Cyprus is a huge burden on Turkey's shoulders, both economically and politically, so it would welcome a solution as soon as possible, as long as the rights of the Turks are guaranteed. For the Turkish Cypriot government, its own existence is at stake, so they tend to favor either a loose confederation or separate states. Remember Turkey supported the Annan plan in 2004 when the Turkish Cypriot president campaigned for no.

Turkish people who immigrated after 1974 and their descendants are also much more willing for a solution than native Cypriots. Native Turkish Cypriots already have right to citizenship of Cyprus, they are EU citizens and have the rights this entails. They can live with the status quo, so they are much more hardline about a solution. However, Turks who went there after 1974 are only citizens of an unrecognized country. They want to have the same rights as the rest of the population, so they consistently vote for pro-solution candidates, like Akıncı.

TL;DR:

* The 89.5% number (as of 2010) is because Greece does not write off old tax debts but keeps them on the books ""forever""^see ^note ^at ^bottom
* In 2010, Greece actually collected 34% of GDP as taxes, slightly below EU average of 38.5% GDP
* Tax gap mainly because of shadow (""cash"") economy, which was 27.5% of GDP in 2009 (compare Netherlands at 13.2%, Germany at 16.0%, Italy at 27.0%, Latvia at 29.2%, Estonia at 31.2%)

Note: Added quotes to *forever* because it's for a large number of years, but obviously not infinity. I couldn't find that number in spite of digging into sources. But the 89.5% is [calculated as](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/taxation/tax-administration-2013_9789264200814-en#page224):

    Value of year-end tax debt ÷ Annual tax collection

At the beginning of 2010, Greece wrote off only 1.6% of the total tax debt--compare to the Ireland at 23.1%, Netherlands at 25.4%, Portugal at 41.6% and Germany at 73.1%. ([source](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/taxation/tax-administration-2013_9789264200814-en#page226))  So the numerator in the above equation always increases, while the denominator changes slightly, leading to the absurd headline number.

You need to apply for the NIE within the first 3 months of your arrival (if you were to be there for under 3 months, it would not be necessary). Honestly, if you don't fear spending a little money, I recommend you go through an immigration consultant/attorney - it would make it stress-free.

Maybe this will help if you want to start the process before moving: http://www.europamortgages.com/spanish-nie-numbers.htm    /// or this: https://www.strongabogados.com/nie.php   

Basically, the 3 documents you will need in order of importance are:

-NIE
-Empadronamiento - it's an official document confirming your address, required for the public health insurance (tarjeta sanitaria). It's only valid for 3 months from the date it's been issued, but you can ask for it online and they send it to you by mail after you get registered the first time. Ofc, if you move, you need to do it again.
-Social security number (numero de la seguridad social) - you need it for your employment contract and for getting the ""tarjeta sanitaria"". If you're not moving for work and will not get the public health insurance, it is not a must. I recommend you do it though.

You all know her, right?

She's the daughter of a protestant priest and has a Phd in ~~physics~~ physical chemistry. She's famous for the [pussy-sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkel-Raute) she does with her hands. There's one [moving photo](http://img.welt.de/img/deutschland/crop130239415/036693526-ci3x2l-w900/Angela-Merkel-auf-Ruegen-1990-2-.jpg) when she visited fishermen in Rügen, directly after unification. They were going to be laid off and they knew it.

After reunification, she quickly became minister in a Kohl cabinet and over long spans of her career was the most underestimated person in national politics. Kohl called her simply ""the girl"" and she was handed the job as environmental minister. She is rather shy and likely an introvert. 

Some years later on, she managed to outmaneuver a lot of her better known colleagues and when the current FinMin Schäuble got entangled in [a shady donations affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDU_donations_scandal') that reeks of corruption in the highest levels of government, she both backstabbed Kohl and sidetracked Schäuble to run for chancellor. Which she finally is. Her first attempt fell flat, but in 2005 she became the first female chancellor in Germany in a very narrow election. The then-incumbent Schröder even laughed at her on the night of the election and told her ""you'll never be chancellor"". Well, that was that, days later she had the keys to the chancellery and he had to move out.

She learned from her master Kohl the art of leading by waiting. Let the minions fight and burn their finger, she waits until the winning option is clear and only then steps in. This works marvelously in a country that is at the top of it's game. In the Greek crisis, the downsides of lacking leadership become very clear, however. In the ongoing scandal over the NSA wiretapping each and everyone in her government, she played the fool only once lashing out and comparing the NSA to the east-German secret service Stasi.

Her personal opinion is not very visible (as she tends to be silent and introvert), she usually speaks out against xenophobia, does not see discrimination against gays as a problem, has promoted other women to important functions (Ms Von der Leyen is the prime example) and generally is not very divisive - AFAIK she is well liked as a person even among large parts of the opposition.

My personal opinion? I have the utmost respect that she tried to keep a working relationship with Putin, even after he trolled her (she's afraid of dogs, he brings his dogs to meetings with her and lets them run around). That she was not afraid of losing face by trying to negotiate an impossible truce in Ukraine. It *is* working bad, but better than I expected. 

I don't think she's as cold as she appears, she seems to split private life and business radically. Her role in the Greek disaster is deplorable - last year she should have stepped up and pushed for some institutional changes in the EZ to allow for ordered bankruptcy of a country, for some shared institutions and financial transfers. Optimally, she'd have written a vision-paper together with Hollande calling for further EZ integration and scaling back of the rest of the EU.

Personally, I think she's a mediocre chancellor. We had worse, but also better ones. I never voted for her because I am no huge fan of her party.",null,0,null,1437027584,null,0,1437036663,0,ct53eox,null,t3_3dgmg7,null,t1_ct53eox,null,t3_3dgmg7,null,null,null,1437894937,null,78,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,78,null

il legislatore può creare tutte le manovre economiche che vuole

se l'azienda pinco palla ha 100 dipendenti che producono al mese 10000 unità prodotto (e possono essere auto, frullatori, materassi o quello che ti pare)  
da un giorno all'altro si ritrova che 30 ore lavorative per legge diventano obbligatorie e pagate come per 40.

quindi 100 dipendenti adesso producono 7500 pezzi  al mese
per recuperare i pezzi persi si assume 33/34 persone in più alle stesse condizioni economiche

metti che all'azienda ogni dipendente costi 2000 euro mese  (tra stipendio e contributi)   
prima ne spendeva 200000, adesso 268000 euro al mese in retribuzioni.

ora i conti dell'azienda sono tutti sballati, che si fa? si alza il prezzo dei prodotti.  

e su chi credi che si ripercuote l'aumento dei prezzi?  
sui consumatori (che sono le stesse persone che lavorano in questa e le altre aziende coinvolte)    
  
piano piano il potere d'acquisto dei singoli operai si ridurrà (perchè aumenterà tutto) e convinti di aver fatto l'affare a guadagnare lo stesso stipendio lavorando il 25% in meno... non si accorgono che il loro potere d'acquisto si riduce anche lui di una somma che tende a quel 25% in meno

Maybe a T-Shirt from your High School (I guess that's where you met?) or a jersey from a team nearby (maybe you went to a game somewhere?)? That would be something I would love. 

American candy is also a great idea and toys for the sons seems cool as well. I try to think of something else that is ""American"" and would be cool as a present.

Regarding the traditions: weddings are in most cases smaller than in the US. As they baptize their child I guess that they will marry in church- in that case they probably are already civily (?) married. Can't go into detail here, as I have never been to a wedding in a chruch.

But I guess what I want to say: If you are already flying over from the US, I think there is not a big pressure/expectation that you will bring too many cash gifts. They will be happy that you are here for the event.

Note that they may have many other things on their mind before the wedding. Don't be disappointed if they seem rude. My girlfriend was maid of honour at 2 weddings and the week before seems to be the most stressful. Do you know other people in Germany as well that you might want to visit? Are you sightseeing the area around Cologne?

Rough math: It currently collects about 35% of GDP in taxes. So if its tax collection rate is 50% (I haven't looked this up, but going with your number), that implies full collection would add up to 70% of GDP. That's absurdly high: the highest tax collector in the EU is Denmark, which collects 50% of GDP in taxes. Which suggests that Greece's tax rates are probably set at unreasonably high levels, as a partial compensation for low compliance. So as Greek tax compliance improves, the rates will in turn have to be lowered, or else the economy will be completely choked with 70%-of-GDP taxation. The end result would probably have to be an increase from the current 35% to a max of around 45-50% of GDP being collected.

The trick, I suppose, is how politically that could be achieved. Currently Greece is supposed to both raise taxes *and* improve compliance, but if it actually manages to do both (which admittedly may or may not happen), it will end up with far too much taxation for a recovery to happen.",null,0,null,1437028790,null,0,1437029158,0,ct53td8,null,t3_3dgqwm,null,t1_ct53td8,null,t1_ct538ty,null,null,null,1437895191,null,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17,null

Usually you tend to your own business. People are more reserved in public and will be a bit weirded out by someone nodding to them. You usually nod to people you know or when you enter an existing social situation (found no better word for it) like elevators or existing conversations.

I know it seems weird and I can't exactly describe why we do this- but to be honest, I was weirded out when people in the US and Australia tried to hold a conversation with me. On the other hand, when somebody in Germany asks you how you are, they usually want to know the answer. It's not just a phrase, it is a question if you understand what I mean.

Both the government and MPs may submit bills, amendments and additions to Parliament.[53] Government bills are called Draft Laws (Greek: Σχέδιο Νόμου, Skhedio Nomou) and must always be accompanied by the General Accounting Office's report estimating its effect on the State Budget.[54] Bills originating from an MP are called Law Proposals (Greek: Πρόταση Νόμου, Protasi Nomou) and must not include provisions benefiting a particular person or persons, such as increases in salaries or pensions, that would lead to a decrease in government revenue.[55] It is also mandatory that an explanatory report is attached to all bills, elaborating on the purpose of the proposed legislation and indicating the exact wording of current legislation to be amended or repealed.[56] Draft Laws (but not Law Proposals) must also be accompanied by an Impact Assessment Report and by a report on the results of the public consultation that took place prior to the submission of the bill.[57] Finally, all bills are examined by the Parliament's own Scientific Agency, which submits a review on the proposed provisions.[58]

Seems like a reasonably rigorous process. I fail to see how having the EU influence what Tsirpas proposes *in the context of implementing the bailout conditions* is a draconian intervention.

The alternative is to expect Greece to do this themselves, in which case the EU would still learn about draft laws of course and would still be able to declare them in violation of the bailout agreement, thereby exercising *exactly* the same amount of influence. This provision just makes this influence explicit. I mostly object to your and other people's insistence on making this provision sound unreasonable, when really it isn't. Instead, it just makes influence that occurs in any case explicit. If I give you 50 billion €, I will have influence over your lawmaking process by having the leverage of demanding this money back if you don't fulfill your end of the deal, no matter whether you have to consult with me on draft legislation or not.

Also, which of these provisions is draconic and wrong?

Yeah, resulting in 63.4, because Serb boycotted (if they didnt it would be around 95% turn out with around 70% for and 30% against. **Very reason Serbs boycotted. They knew they would lose**)|

Fuck me. Barred. No point of discussing when making up shit.

&gt;Although I agree; if significant number of an ethnic group doesn't want to live in certain union they should secede. So, both RS and Kosovo should be allow to secede. Right?? WRONG! Because, every second Westerner I know, who is pro Kosovo independence is definitely not a supporter of RS independence. 

Yeah, and I say that is wrong. Now you tell me that both  Kosovo and RSK  should have independence and we can have agreement. But no, you **want one but not the other** . and when west does this it is injustice, when Serbians do this, it is justice

&gt;I think you're confusing your numbers there. Those are the amounts of the population they constitute(d). Almost all of them wanted independence and to remain in Yugoslavia. 


Yeah sure. They wanted to stay in Yugoslavia. Because Yugoslavia implied Yugoslavia where it will only be the way Serbia wanted while the will of other ethic groups are denied. Basically, staying in Yugoslavia ment being connected to Serbia

That's one interpretation. 

On the other hand, half the required reforms in the third bailout were already required in the second, and quite a few already in the first. E.g. restricted professions are still as bad as they used to be, similarly for tax collection. Instead of making it easier to find employment, Greek politiicans demonize the lenders, instead of collecting the huge amounts of back taxes from the rich, they raise the taxes on the weakest members of society.

I think the strict conditions are simply the only way Germany was willing to accept another bailout. They've seen how difficult it is to make structural changes in Greece that hurt the privileged.

La droite a vu ca et a décider de nous soutenir pour récupérer un maximum de décus de la gauche. Politique classique. Faut dire que les SJW sont le meilleur argument que la droite ait jamais eu.

2)C'est un peu le contraire en fait. Gamergate en a sa claque des idéologues universitaires voulant politiser tout (et dont la conclusion est généralement ""Tout est sexiste et raciste, et la solution et de filer des subventions au jeux ""progressistes"" de nos potes). La ligne est plutot ""Fuck cette idée ""d'art"", faut se concentrer sur la qualité du divertissement, via un bon moteur de jeu, un bon gameplay, et il vaut mieux du fanservice que de la prédication.

3) C'est pas comme si ces critiques et developpeurs indés avait vicieusement attaqués d'autres developpeurs et personalités sur la base de rumeurs (Brad Wardell, Max Temkin), des journalistes pour oser montrer leurs arnaques (Pinsoff) ,leur audience a tout bout de champ (entitled partout, traiter les fans des boobs de Sorceress de pedos), et des innocents pour l'attention (Wizardchan). Trop c'etait trop, et ca allait exploser un jour ou l'autre.

4)On est pas des insiders , juste des losers autistes extremement persistants. On n'a pas les moyens d'obtenir de l'information s'attaquant au AAAs. Ca devrait etre les roles des journaux eux memes vu qu'ils ont les contacts, mais ils sont trop occupés dans ce gloubi-bouliga progressiste tapant sur les classes moyennes geek (Problablement parce qu'il n'y a pas de risque, contrairement a perdre des copies en avance ou du swag en nature).

You mean like consisting of man and woman? Or being able to conceive a child on their own?

I am sure that marriage is not equal to a partnership in legal terms in many places, and that needs to be corrected. But insisting that it absolutely has to be called ""marriage"" is like insisting that all women must be addressed as ""gentlemen"". Because they have same rights as men so what's the problem? Or black people called white. Because they also have same rights so what's the problem? Because it's not the same. What's wrong with it being different? What's wrong with having different names to avoid confusion? Point is, they do need to have same rights, but there is absolutely no need at all to bear same name. No need to redefine existing, well established words just to make them more broad-term. It does not make people feel weird, it makes them feel confused. It IS just semantics. If it wasn't, the term would itself would not be important at all.

And we are still talking about semantics and not discrimination itself at all. What about men who want to wear short skirts in the schools and offices and other public places?

This kind of retail-regulation stuff has been common in many European countries with stronger economies than Greece's. Denmark had more regulated shops and opening hours until recently, then liberalized them in the past few years, and it didn't really impact the macroeconomic picture either way.

I think Greece could use some structural changes. For example: a more efficient, less corrupt civil service, and streamlining of general regulations around starting a business that are a drag on the economy. But to me what this editorial is pushing (which some of the conditions in the Eurogroup package are also pushing) reads like opportunism. People who already have a preexisting political opposition to retail regulation that is aimed at protecting small retailers think this is a good excuse to get their opinion enacted into law against a country's preferences. It may or may not be a good idea to let grocery stores open on Sunday, or to liberalize the way bakeries/butchers/groceries/etc. are defined and regulated (and we have had this debate ongoing in Denmark, too), but in my opinion it is basically irrelevant to Greece's current economic problems, and kind of dishonest and anti-democratic to be using the crisis to push this ideology.

I come from India, where earlier in 70s and 80s evading taxes was very high and we were nearly bankrupt. But now with more private sector jobs, its harder to evade taxes. I'm not saying that things are the best in India, but opening markets and privatisation has increased the standard of living remarkably.

Then you have the argument that kids are too young to understand.......also bullshit, I was going to have my first sex ed lesson at 11 years old, I brought in a video for my teacher to watch for the lesson called ""How the body works"" it had 2 naked people (Supposed Adam and eve) in the intro.....everybody laughed but me and it was stopped, it wasn't until I was 13 I would get my first sex ed lesson.

We live in a world where ""children don't know anything and need to be protected from the horrors of the world including the naked human form.""

The debt isn't to be cut to give gift to Greece or delivering any kind of justice, the debt is cut simply because it needs to be cut in order for Greece to rebound as an economy and country.

However just cutting the debt for example to 2/3 isn't the right way to do it. Any Greek debt cut should be done via dynamic debt restructuring where debt moratorium is attached to debt to GDP ratio. For example now it is useless to ask Greece to pay anything, the best that can be asked from Greece is to run surplus budgets and the Greek state to live with the money that it gathers. When the Greek economy rebounds again, economic growth is restored and Greece hits for example a certain target like debt to GDP ratio of 120% then Greece will start to repay and amortize part of the debt, when the ratio hits 100% another portion until Greece can handle all its debt.

Of course this kind of policy means that there has to be vigilant inspections to the finances of Greek state so that they don't funnel loaned money and that they account everything correctly. When Greece finally starts to payback its debts, then one step at a time inspections can be stopped and Institutions can leave Greece.

null,false,xouba,null,null,null,"As a good galician, my answer has to be: ""it depends"".

First, it would depend on the permeability of the new frontiers. If the independent regions were able to trade with the rest of Spain as they are now, their economy would still be able to generate a lot of income. The Basque Country and Catalonia are power houses in spanish economy, being heavily industrialized and having a rich trading history. Galicia, on the other hand, has always been poor, with low and old population (dwindling more and more each year), and its economy is mostly based on land and sea resources (i.e., farming, fishing), so we wouldn't fare very well.

Second, it would depend on what amount of money they're receiving now from the central government. I don't know how much it is, and if they receive more than what they could save by not belonging to Spain, their economy would collapse.

Sorry if the answer is not very informed. I'm no expert in this, and it's also a matter where it's hard to come by unbiased data. You usually find only data from one or the other side, twisted to support their opinion.

My final opinion is that, whatever its viability, independence is being used now as the carrot to pull romantic believers in some kind of past Arcady of independent bliss towards the political interests of the parties that support it.

Maybe due to this market evolution another Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, etc.. is invented and 20 years from now we will read an article about the miracle story of a Greek entrepreneur who reinvented Greek yogurt.

Another thing to think about is that cutting down government bureaucracy and corruption takes huge amount of time, it can easily take a decade or another to make the Greek civil services run as efficiently as they do in the Nordics, thus in the mean time it is best to just liberate and deregulate as much of the private sector as possible. Let people and companies by themselves think on how they can create value. The good thing in Greece is that it is already one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world thus Greek entrepreneurs and companies can easily tap international consumer market in their own country.

Non è neanche detto che la produzione di meno pezzi porti automaticamente all'aumento dei prezzi, sai ci sono da considerare i costi di ammortamento i pezzi fallati ecc. ecc. non è tutto riconducibile a funzioni lineari; se la produzione ha già ammortizzato i costi iniziali, una riduzione dell'orario lavorativo potrebbe portare ad un aumento della qualità del singolo pezzo nonché ad una diminuzione dei pezzi errati in quanto il personale è più riposato e meno incline agli errori.

più tempo libero vuol dire anche più tempo per spendere il proprio salario e quindi l'economia gira di più, e non dimentichiamoci che più lavoratori = meno disoccupati = meno costi di assistenzialismo quindi si potrebbe arrivare a parità di netto all'operaio in minori tasse per il datore e conseguentemente un lordo inferiore.

I don't see how that undermines the claim at all at this point. It was clear from the beginning this wasn't a deliberate act (read the post of the separatists right after MH17 was downed, glorifying another downing of a UA transport plane), that doesn't take away the fact they fucked up and instead of hitting an UA transport plane, hitting a civil airliner.

But the situation is that both parties involved (separatists and Russia) are denying any involvement, which makes it interesting. If they did claim involvement we could have seen a similar case when US downed a civil airliner (Flight 655). A case that compensated the claims.

  * GPON avec mutualisation et équipements dans les immeubles
  * GPON avec mutualisation sur un point d'accès local

&gt; /s?

Not at all. The mistake the Syriza did was to walk out from the second bailout program at the beginning of this year. After that happened Troika stopped giving new payments to the Greek state. The Greek state had to survive with their budget surplus and pay with it loan payments back. This would have been barely possible if the Greek people wouldn't have become alarmed, first tax revenue went down when people stopped paying their taxes and then Greek savers started a slow bank run to get their money out of the banks while they could. This all started in January. Everything would have come to an halt earlier if the ECB wouldn't have continuously raised ELA limits, however after the second bailout program ended, there was no base anymore to rise the limit of ELA, actually it should have been denied but to limit damages ECB just froze it.

Now if Syriza would have continued to be inside the second bailout program, Troika would have given payments that they could have used to pay loans. Staying inside the second bailout program might also have increased trust of Greek people and they wouldn't have stopped paying taxes nor started to pull monies out of the banks.",null,1,null,1437033796,null,0,1437034346,0,ct55c9d,null,t3_3dh6ee,null,t1_ct55c9d,null,t1_ct55607,null,null,null,1437896372,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

So in the end of the year you just had to file the taxes and of course pay the amount which wasn't already deducted if any. You had no way to evade taxes.

Es unterdrückt auch das Auskeimen von Sporen, ohne allerdings ausreichend sporozid zu wirken (1). **Ethanol-Konzentrationen unter 5 Prozent (V/V) haben in der Regel keine Wirkung.** Die konservierende Wirkung ist pH-abhängig; sie setzt im sauren Milieu bei etwa 15 Prozent (V/V) ein, in neutraler oder schwach basischer Lösung werden etwa 18 Prozent (V/V) Ethanol benötigt (1).

Overegulation is not a problem for the Greek economy. The article blows things out of proportion. Few sectors are overregulated. Most sectors of the Greek economy have regulations comparable to other European countries.

Please remember that before the crisis, Greece's public debt was 120% of its GDP. That was entirely sustainable, and the proof for this is that according to the Troika's plans, the debt will become 120% of GDP in 2020.

The real problem of Greece is its trade deficit with other countries of the EU.

Slowly after pegging the drachma to the euro, Greece's businesses started to close or sold, making Greece more and more dependent on borrowing in order to buy goods and services. Greek businesses, mostly small scale family units could not compete wirh the big businesses that arrived in Greece.

During the years 2002-2008, the Greek governments, not desiring to impose austerity, borrowed an ever increasing amount of money. Everyone was happy: the politicians, the bankers, the businessmen. Until the 2008 crisis.

The only way for Greeks to come back is to produce things other people want, so as that money flows into the economy and stays there.

I see you added 'taxes and legislation' to the term standardise.. And I agree with you if you are trying to harmonise taxes or legislation then you probably do need political union. You don't need political union to standardise generally, you can do that through regulation in a common market...

&gt;From my experience it's a pain in the ass, I guess we agree to disagree then.

I guess we do need to disagree..

&gt;Culture and language barriers makes it difficult. There is completely different systems of paying rent etc that you have to adapt to and many other forms of varying bureaucracy. You have to open a new bank account, etc.

Apart from possibly the change in bank account, that would all be true in a Federal Europe too... Unless you are suggesting that we harmonise local government processes and procedures too..

&gt;This sentence makes no sense so I assume you're grasping for straws at this point.

OK, let me rephrase it. If there is a significant issue with corruption within various political systems in the EU, what evidence is there to suggest that it wouldn't end up in whatever mangled framework an EU superstate is built with, given it is exactly those politicians who would be responsible for setting up this new state.

Or you accept that wellfare state is expensive and pay high taxes.

From the way I see it, Greece should embrace the small state. You already dont have cash, no one pay taxes, just go with reality. But remember that you are alone if the shit hit the fan.

So yeah, lower the taxes. But privatize everything that not police, army and children´s education.

Under the terms of the second bailout, Greece was supposed to reach a primary budget surplus of 3% in 2015, and 4.5+% from 2016 onward.

Moreover, to actually start paying down the debt, Greece would need to run a sustained primary budget surplus of 7+% from 2020 to 2030, with continued large surpluses for at least two decades thereafter.

And for any of that to work, Greece would also need to manage robust economic growth during the same period of time.

In terms of realism, all of the above is comparable to telling a 400 pound diabetic man that to get healthy, he needs to start running weekly sub-2:10 marathons.

&gt;&gt; On average, self-employed Greeks spend 82% of their monthly reported income servicing debt. To put this number in perspective, the standard practice in consumer finance (in the United States as well as Greece) is to never lend to borrowers such that loan payments are greater than 30% of monthly income. And that is the upper limit ... 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A number of banks in southern Europe told us point blank that they have adaptation formulas to adjust clients' reported income to the bank's best estimate of true income, and furthermore, that these adjustments are specific to occupations ... Take the examples of lawyers, doctors, financial services, and accountants. In all of these occupations, the self-employed are paying over 100% of their reported income flows to debt servicing on consumer loans
&gt;
&gt; You read that right: More than 100% of the self-reported income of Greece's professional classes is going toward paying off consumer debts. Not, we suspect, because they have massive unbearable repayments to make, but because they're colossally underreporting their income.

&gt; The  events of the past two weeks—the closure of banks and imposition of capital controls—are extracting a heavy toll on the banking system and the economy, leading to a further significant deterioration in debt sustainability relative to what was projected in our recently published DSA.  A full and comprehensive revision of this debt sustainability analysis can 2only be done at a later stage, taking into account the deterioration in the economic situation as a result of the closing of the banking system and the details of policies yet to be agreed. However, it is already clear at this stage that there will be a significant increase in the financing need. The preliminary (mutually agreed) assessment of the three institutions is that total financing need through end-2018 will increase to Euro 85 billion, or **some Euro 25 billion above what was projected in the IMF’s published DSA only two weeks ago, largely on account of the estimated need for a larger banking sector backstop for Euro 25 billion.**

The past two weeks solely costed 25 billion on the banking sector. So... no sarcasm needed.

---

This is not to discount the fact that the previous government was completely unable to pass reforms in Q4 2014 under Syriza's real threat of forcing elections, Syriza's call to the citizens not to pay taxes that they would erase in January, and the bad PR from the Greek proposal for 1 billion measures in 2015. However, the majority of the damage after end of summer 2014 (where the debt was sustainable) was done in the past 6 months.

&gt; In monthly reports, Greece's financial crimes unit lists finalized tax investigation cases and recent offenders include doctors, engineers, high tech firms, construction companies, clothing manufacturers, bakeries, architects and advertising agencies.

&gt; Many cases involve unreported income of hundreds of thousands of euros or more and one lawyer failed to report 16 million euros in income, the unit said in a statement last week.

&gt; But many cases go uninvestigated because of poorly trained tax investigators, personnel shortages and politically motivated appointments of tax investigation supervisors, said Haris Theoharis, who was Greece's top tax enforcer until last year and is now a lawmaker with the centrist To Potami party.

&gt; Theoharis said it's too soon to tell whether the governing far left Syriza party will mount an effective campaign against tax evasion because few specifics of its plans have been disclosed. He argued that freeing the system from political interference is key: ""Unless they depoliticize the tax administration and stop trying to interfere with who gets promoted,"" he said, ""they will not have success.""",null,0,null,1437035406,null,0,false,0,ct55rex,null,t3_3dh6zo,null,t1_ct55rex,null,t1_ct55l9t,null,null,null,1437896680,null,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12,null

""The principle of subsidiarity aims at determining the level of intervention that is most relevant in the areas of competences shared between the EU and the Member States. This may concern action at European, national or local levels. In all cases, the EU may only intervene if it is able to act more effectively than Member States.

But you've probably never heard anything about that from any party in the UK...

Localised taxation is of course possible, and variable rates within a country already happens throughout other EU countries. Investment in the North or any other region would be greatly increased if the tax rates within the UK was different by region, but of course a centralising UK government would never dream of that for ordinary people, but are more than happy to do it for large corporations...

Syriza didn't cause the damage by its own decisions per se, it was rather because they stopped ""extending and pretending"", which caused this immediate halt. Ultimately now we can say it was stupid to act so because they finally signed the agreement, but at the time there were both economic and political premises to not sign and seek other forms of agreement. (and there still are economical premises, it's just what we learned that the political ones didn't exist)

Syriza stopped ""extend and pretend"" without having any plan-B or anything to offer for the Eurogroup. Lets look this from the other point of view...

If Eurogroup in January would have conceded to cut down the debt that they own, lets say they would have made a really deep cut and the debt would be now only 120% of GDP, then what? The debts that would have been cut were not a current problem as Greece starts to pay back then only in 2020 and in 2022. The debt to ECB and IMF can't be cut. And there would be no new loans coming to Greece because cutting Greek debts would lead huge political ramifications in central and northern European countries, if the Eurogroup would be not only cutting debt and then giving new money to Greece, there would be rioting in the north, citizens couldn't accept that ever. Not to forget that at the end of the day, Greece and Syriza would have come to this exact same point anyway, they wouldn't have had money to pay back IMF and then ECB.

What Tsipras and Varoufakis did was to gamble with the threat of saying no. What they thought would happen is chaos in the market that would at the end of the day force Eurogroup to surrender to Greek demands. However what happened is that market already had factored Syriza and Greek crisis in and thus the markets didn't react at all to OXI. The fault of driving Greece over the edge belongs totally to Syriza and especially to Tsipras and Varoufakis who gambled with the destiny and well being of the whole nation.

null,false,littlepwny,null,null,null,"Draghi had made it clear that he can only support Greece while they remain in a program. You could argue that ELA was cut 3 days before the 2nd memorandum but there are a few issues to this logic:

* Draghi had made it clear that he can only support Greece while they remain in a bailout Program.

* Greece made it clear on Friday 26 June that they will not pay the IMF and that, given that a referendum on the Juncker proposal was declared, Greece would miss the 30 June deadline to reach an agreement with the creditors. This date was known from the 20th of February.

* For someone that would argue that Draghi had to wait for the deadline (in simple terms: I won't pay you but keep giving me money till the actual deadline), I would like to remind you that capital controls would still have to be applied starting the 1st of July which would only serve to further increase the capital flight in Greece.

* Greece was talking about some kind of ultimatum when the negotiations, in truth, still carrying on. (See: Revised Juncker Proposal)

* ELA is an emergancy fund that had been abused for months and had reached the level of 50% of the Greek GDP. This travesty can be seen [here](http://s.kathimerini.gr/resources/2015-06/13s5eladaneia-thumb-large.jpg); top graph is ELA level in billions from January 2015, bottom graph shows the bankrun.

So yes, Draghi's decision was quite expected and - most likely - the only way to keep him from facing legal repercussions. If anything, we should be grateful that Draghi did not remove Greece from ELA and immediately demand the entirety of ECB's loans on 1st of July.

PS: Draghi is not some kind of monarch; he is the head of the Governing Council of the ECB which is comprised from the governors of the national central banks.

Therefore an independent organization gives credible advice whether to fly above certain altitudes (33.000ft) depending on intelligence, in this case: manpads.

Regarding the no fly zone. Civil airlines took the necessary measures to avoid being hit with manpads. No airliner took the responsible measure to divert its route due to the conflict zone. KLM, Malaysia Airlines and others claimed to have diverted its route to avoid the area based on the risk. But according to the latest findings of the investigation these airline companies had to divert the flights based on an ""administrative"" decision. Not one based on risk. After MH17 was downed, they turned it to their benefit claiming they were responsible to take that decision based on risk, while this was not the case at all. 

Thus the airliners followed the necessary measures that were given. No airliner diverted its route because of risk but because of an administrative decision. However, airliners followed the orders of flying above a certain altitude based on intelligence (manpads) above 33.000ft.

Plus the problems like Greece is facing will only be something you can all face together, Most of Europe is in Debt, It's easier to face that together then it would be for even the richest country to go it alone, and not in the current way either. 

Plus by all chances the more poorer nations will be split up once again into ""influence zones"" and so rather then cooperating it's competition as puppets.


I view the EU as the only way Europe as a whole will stay independently Europe ""and not in the nationalistic Europe for Europeans"" kind of way.


i agree with you on that too, the EU would need to change, I think it must change, or everyone's basically fucked.

The Passions are full of examples of injustice. Of course, as a hero-centric work, the narrator is trapped in its own point of view, considering unjust the behaviour of people foreign to them (fellow countrymen, with whom he identifies) or enemies. He sees the world fragmented, and its goods unevenly distributed - who does this remind you of? From personal experience, he knows love for material goods and greed are leading to violence against others (him), their humiliation, their ignominy, and extermination. He deplores the lawful distinction between right and wrong, just and unjust, every system of law which benefits some and discriminates against others.

The poem, although wonderful, doesn't describe today in the slightest, imo, but that's for the future historian to judge. There's more interesting stuff in the parts OP conveniently has to omit, Elytis' hero's validity of suffering is challenged in two points: Injustice towards them begins not only from external enemies, but their own behaviour, and secondly, the hero himself admits regardless of his initial denial to use the same weapons of injustice, he too commits unjust acts. His desperation clouds his mind, leading to inability to judge friend from foe. I guess he knew what responsibility actually meant.

Elytis was far wiser than you, OP. You nitpicking on excerpts to present your pathetic petition distorts his work completely. You should be ashamed of yourself.

PS. For those that want to read a decent analysis of Elytis' Axion Esti (""Worthy It Is""), from where this passage is taken, see [here](http://www.fryktories.gr/sites/fryktories.gr/files/fileresources/axion_esti_elyths.pdf).",null,0,null,1437036528,null,0,false,0,ct561qs,null,t3_3dhcwh,null,t1_ct561qs,null,t3_3dhcwh,null,null,null,1437896860,null,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8,null

L'erreur, c'est de croire que le gamergate est un mouvement organisé. C'est, du reste, la même erreur qui est faite par les gens qui assument que ""le féminisme"" ou ""les SJW"" sont un mouvement organisé.

Y'a des ""bandes"". Ya 8ch/gg. Y'a d'autres trucs. Mais il n'y a pas de vrai leader (ceux qui se proclament leader le font surtout parce que personne n'est en position de dire que c'est du bullshit), et la majorité des ""figures"" du gamergate telles que les présentent les médias sont surtout des gens qui surfent sur la vague (ceux que tu vois comme ayant ""noyauté"" le gamergate). Que des gens se retrouvent à les suivre, ce n'est qu'un effet négatif de la présentation faite du ""mouvement"". Du reste, si y'a 50 personnes qui sont venues à leur petit meeting débile, ça prouve bien que la majorité des râleurs n'en ont strictement rien à carer de ces teubés néocons.

1. C'est le seul point qui tient la route, mais on ne peut pas cacher aux Français que la dette grecque ne sera probablement jamais remboursée. Il y a quasiment consensus chez les économistes là-dessus et cette hypothèse est très largement médiatisée.

2. L'impossibilité de jouer sur la dévaluation est un gros problème pour de nombreux pays en Europe notamment face à l'excédent allemand. Mais actuellement la Grèce elle-même demande officiellement à rester dans l'Europe et dans la zone Euro. On ne peut pas dire qu'on lui force la main en ce sens.

3. "" The economic and monetary union of Europe works only if rules are respected"". Bullshit. L'union monétaire ne fonctionne pas en l'absence d'union fiscale. S'il n'y a ni transferts fiscaux ni dévaluation possible, certaines économies sont en permanence pénalisées par l'Euro.

4. Tous les pays ayant des créances grecques ont fait exactement la même chose. Est-ce moral ? Économiquement sain ? C'est sujet à débat (la fameuse question des banques qui font de la merde et qu'on ne laisse pas tomber pour éviter une catastrophe économique de plus grande ampleur).

&gt; Greece is one of the few European countries that sets prices for over-the-counter drugs, which can be sold only in licensed pharmacies, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported. Pharmacies must be owned by licensed pharmacists and they can each own only one. Other rules dictate where new pharmacies may open, as well as their operating hours.

It's almost the same in Germany.

&gt;Meanwhile, entry is restricted in a flotilla of fields including taxi and truck drivers, engineers, notaries, actuaries and bailiffs.

As in Germany.

&gt; Most shops are required to close on Sundays.

Also true for Germany.

&gt; Bakeries can sell breads to consumers only in a few specified weights.

Uh, I guess that is problem here is that he is American, having zero exposure to actual bread, but I fully expect my bread to be of the same mass over and over again. Guess that comes with being German.

&gt;Similarly, Greece runs a Swiss-cheese-like tax system in which large sections of the economy (such as electricity, hotels and many of the country’s islands) fall under a lower rate of value-added tax.

Uh a difference to Germany. Electricity has a tax that taxes a tax added, but we halso have extensive exceptions on what products pay the normal and which are taxed at a reduced rate. For example: fast food to take away has the lower VAT. If you eat in the ""restaurant"" it's the higher rate. That's why you always get asked if you are going to take it home or eat there in Germany.

I am sorry, but those aren't good examples for over-regulation that is holding the country back when Germany is actually very similar.

So his closing remark is just silly:

&gt;But in reality, Germany and other tough-minded European nations should be thanked for forcing Greece to bring its economy into the 21st century.

Yeah, do as we say not as we do. 

Clearly, opening shops on Sunday could give a tourism dependent country a marginal boost in sales, but it's definitely not going to fix what ails Greece. 

Greece had a huge trade deficit, which means that their wages are too high in relation to their productivity. That is Greeces primary problem and not that it's bread weighs 0.5 kg or 1 kg or something silly like 523 g. Wages had to come down to make it more competitive, which typically happens through devaluation. Greece can't do that so we used ""internal devaluation"" to simulate the process. Here is hard core leftist [Milton Friedman's](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/07/07/opinion/070715krugman2/070715krugman2-blog480.png) opinion on how that such a process is going to work. From 1950 ! Additionally lowering wages means lower nominal GDP which in turn means higher debt to GDP even if one achieves a small primary surplus. ""Structural reforms"" may or may not be helpful in the long term, but they will sure as hell not change the short term need to slash wages. A competent central bank would have been helpful on that issue though. 

A competent central bank would have pushed some of the burden of bringing wages closer to a level of similar competitiveness on Germany, by lowering the base rate quickly and pushing for QE early. If that had happened then real wages in Germany would have increased which they pretty much didn't until this year. So Germany would have more wealthy citizens that import more goods and our [trade balance](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/balance-of-trade) wouldn't be completely out of control, which it is. Germans should realize that this shows that they are massively underpaid (a small surplus should be kept). As Friedman has said it's much easier to increase wages than to lower them. Except in Germany, where everybody is happy as long as his fucking neighbor doesn't get any more money.

&gt;  Mit Flüchtlingen überfordert
&gt; 
&gt; Die Palästinenser leben zwar schon seit ihrer Flucht und Vertreibung bei der Gründung Israels 1948 im Libanon, zum Teil bereits in der dritten Generation. Aber bis heute brauchen sie für alle Berufe eine Arbeitserlaubnis. Die benötigt jeder Ausländer im Land, die sind teuer und mit hohen bürokratischen Hürden verbunden. Im Jahr 2009 stellte der Libanon nur 99 für Palästinenser aus. Er ist der einzige arabische Staat, der die Palästinenser als Ausländer behandelt.
&gt; 
&gt; Dazu kommt: 30 Berufe, vom Ingenieur und Apotheker bis zum Taxifahrer und Friseur, dürfen nur von Mitgliedern der jeweiligen Berufsverbände ausgeübt werden. Dort können Palästinenser jedoch nicht Mitglied werden. Entweder ist der Zugang nur den Libanesen reserviert, oder es gilt das Prinzip der Reziprozität: Ausländer können nur dann Mitglied werden, wenn Libanesen in deren Herkunftsstaat in ihrem Beruf arbeiten dürfen. Doch noch ist Palästina ja nicht als Staat anerkannt. Vor allem deshalb haben nach Angaben des Uno-Flüchtlingswerks nur 37 Prozent der Flüchtlinge zwischen 15 und 65 Jahren Arbeit.

Je pense que tu te focalises beaucoup sur la cristalisation sur les SJW, qui est plus une forme de frustration externalisée qu'autre chose (""mais pourquoi eux on les écoute et pas nous ?"").

Sur le côté gamergate / harcèlement de rue, je pense que y'a du vrai dedans, mais personnellement, c'est pas trop la critique de tel ou tel jeu qui m'a gonflé (même si j'aime pas ce que raconte Sarkeesian parce que c'est très orienté et souvent un peu de mauvaise foi, quoi que le propos de fond soit assez juste), c'est plutôt d'une part le niveau aberrant de la presse vidéoludique, qui oscille entre mecs payés pour promouvoir honteusement des daubes (Gameblog en étant l'étendard), malhonnêtes (les YouTubeurs sponsorisés qui se gardent bien de le dire, par exemple), et plus généralement juste nuls (le nombre de critiques faites en 3h avec une vision superficielle du jeu, et des commentaires du genre ""c'est joli mais bon chaispas moi j'aime pas hein donc 6/10"" =&gt; il vaut peut-être 6/10 mais qu'est-ce que tu m'apprends ? Rien). Sans parler du fait qu'une partie de cette presse a voulu surfer sur la vague féministe (qui en soi est une bonne chose pour notre société, on est définitivement pas à l'égalité...) et a commencé à vouloir inclure un commentaire féministe sur absolument tout et n'importe quoi...Qui plus est, émanant de gens qui, le plus souvent, n'ont juste pas la culture pour le faire.

Bref, y'a un mélange des gens qui 1) me court sur les haricots 2) brouille tout le débat et 3) génère principalement des tombereaux d'étrons inutiles.

Sinon, pour le féminisme structuré, je sais pas. Y'a pas mal de théories, et je suis sûr que y'a plein de gens qui te diraient que celle qui te dit que les femmes devraient dominer le monde, si si, elle est féministe. Et j'ai envie de dire, est-ce faux ? ""Féministe"", ça veut globalement dire, ""qui pense que les femmes sont pas traitées correctement et voudrait bien que ça change"". Même si on pourrait dire que le ""féminisme raisonnable"" vise à rétablir une égalité avec les hommes, y'a débat sur ce que veut dire cette égalité. Tout ça pour dire que tu peux dire ""je considère que X ou Y n'est pas féministe"", mais ça leur enlève pas le droit de se revendiquer féministe (ce qui, incidemment, est exactement ce que je décrivais pour le gamergate...Le monde est petit !).",null,0,null,1437037811,null,0,false,0,ct56cw8,null,t3_3dhbth,null,t1_ct56cw8,null,t1_ct565a9,null,null,null,1437897179,null,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4,null

&gt;A same-sex union was known in Ancient Greece and Rome, ancient Mesopotamia, in some regions of China, such as Fujian province, and at certain times in ancient European history. These same-sex unions continued until Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. 

&gt;A law in the Theodosian Code (C. Th. 9.7.3) was issued in 342 AD by the Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans, which prohibited same-sex marriage in ancient Rome and ordered that those who were so married were to be executed.

He's a relative newcomer in politics, got first elected to the parliament at first attempt in 2011 and was elected head of the Center party in 2012. When the Center party won the elections this spring, as the largest party, he became the prime minister.

By profession he is a Master of Science (Technology) or as said in Finnish, diploma-engineer and before political career he managed to get quite wealthy leading and owning different tech firms. In the 90's he sold some of his business and got over 10 million euros for it.

He's from the Finnish bible belt and is by religion closely connected to [Laestadianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laestadianism), a conservative lutheran belief. So by Finnish standards he's pretty religious, but he has kept his religious views strictly out of politics and they aren't an issue that much.

Mark Rutte is actually single, allowing him to devote a lot of time to his job, but it also leads to speculations of him being a closet homosexual. Leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) a liberal, centre-right party. He's known as a follower of the Merkel line of austerity, reform and low deficits. In 2010, he became the first VVD leader to win the elections and the party's first PM. After his minority right-wing coalition of liberals and christian democrats lost the parliamentary support of Wilders and his Freedom Party in 2012, elections were held in which the VVD won again. The VVD entered into a difficult coalition with the centre-left Labour Party, in which both parties were forced to break key promises. So far, Rutte's pragmatism has been helpful in preventing the goverment from collapsing. Rutte constantly has to look for majorities in the Senate, where the governing parties alone don't have enough seats. So far, Rutte has been doing this remarkably well.

Another issue with high self-employment rates (or large numbers of very small companies) is, aside from tax evasion, is that those tend to be inefficient.

Do you understand that Greece itself has played itself into a corner where it does not have many good choices left? 

Were it Estonians, Latvians, Britons, Germans, French (just name it...) that borrowed money, raised pensions to enormous levels, provided ridiculous (**unsustainable**) amount of social benefits, wasted it all on running expenses instead of investing it into growth of economy? Nope. They were Greek.

I wonder how people estrange from the simple truth - you can only afford what you have money for. Borrowed money is not yours. You can't buy luxury goods or good life for borrowed money. Yes, technically you can but you still got to pay back borrowed money.

I know it seems too black n' white but this is how I see it from distance.

I'm planning a vacation in Greece in September. Then I can look at the situation closer, talk to locals etc.
