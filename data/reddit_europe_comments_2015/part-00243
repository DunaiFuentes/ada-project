Who happen to represent a disproportionate amount of Muslims. 

That word is vague as hell anyway. The ""moderates"", even hold radical and barbaric views; some views that are even antithetical to the core values of Western civilisation.

&gt;Of course they ""shop around"", if you got a better job proposal in Sweden wouldn't you go there? Can't you see how selfish it is to say ""I was born in this land, therefore only my kids can live in it and no one else. Go back to your country, I don't care how messed up it is, that's the country you got, deal with it yourself""

A country is like your house. A house build by you and your ancestors over thousands of years. It's a beautiful house. 

It's not selfish to want to protect the quality of your house and the hard work of your ancestors that built the house. Even considering you were born into it by no choice of your own. 

Sure you can invite guests to stay in your house and share its beauty. Some guests are fine and some guests are great (they will improve the place with their presence). However, there are some guests that get drunk, punch holes in the walls, leave the electricity on and shit on the carpets. These guests shouldn't be invited. 

If I got a good job offer in Sweden, I would probably take it. Mind you, I was invited and I'd meet the quality of guest they want. 

Refugees aren't invited and they vary in quality (the average being on the lower end of the spectrum). There is only so many the nicest house on the street can take before someone starts shitting on the carpet.

&gt;We have no right to deny people's entry based on religion or country of origin.

Yes, we do and many countries do deny people on these grounds.

Ah yes. I'm sure the country will stop having electric power, heating and running water. That would never go wrong. There totally wouldn't be a revolution within the week /s

&gt; There is some talk, though, about sending some tax enforcing officers to help the Greeks setting up a stick themselves.

I suspect you confuse 2 very different things : 

- They have public &amp; private debts, and they can only pay those very slowly, not at current rates.

- People also have to pay taxes (the usual ones i'm talking. Those that exist in every countries and are perfectly normal). 

Now there is a *giant* tax fraud issue; especially from some very very wealthy individual and companies. Everyone fraud those; it's cultural.

Now if Germany help Greece collecting the second, that would probably mean like +10 to 20B (well i'd say a lot more but you wouldn't believe me on the numbers) per year , which means they could 1°) run better their own country (more cash in the budget) 2°) while still paying more money back 3°) without additionnal strain on the system 4°) and the less corruption the better.

I'd also support it, because while i support dropping part of the tax debts on the poorest (&lt;1500€/mo; because that money don't exist); quite frankly if you are a shipping operator and have 2'000'000'000€ stashed abroad on accounts and claim you don't have to pay taxes, honestly fuck you. And there is a lot of money to make there.

&gt; It would be a very, very short war, with horrific consequences for Greece. 

Most likely. Then you'd still have banditism issues in every single neighbor, people dying left &amp; right, and basically a right wing north korea in the middle of the continent. Oh and instead of trying to get them to open more we want to cease every single last buck they have. Am i the only one here thinking this is a bad idea ?

&gt;  and the Kim family setting the ""right"" priorities.

It is not. The ""right to offend"" is a neologism that was invented for the *modern* debate concerning the right to freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is the inherent human right to voice one's opinion publicly without fear of censorship of punishment. To make being offensive the core element of that freedom is to take it hostage, an act done by mistakenly believing that it does not exist at all *unless a person offends*. Nowadays, we have an informal thought police on the Internet and in the media trying to push others into believing that reality is so, while it is not.

If you use freedom of speech to be offensive solely for the sake it, it is the duty of everyone who disagrees to complain about you and counter you until your head hurts because what you have done is disrespectful, childish, and unnecessary. Geert Wilders is not a freedom fighter, he is a discriminating, narrow minded, bigoted, hypocritical, anti-democratic anti-Muslim.


You will note that he does not use examples from across the spectrum of thought in ""defending freedom of speech"". Nothing like sharing what goes on inside Mormon temples or Freemason lodges, things that are also forbidden by their communities. Surely, other communities have similar taboos. No, Geert Wilders singles out Muslims *because they are Muslims*, making him as bad as the Turks who supported the Armenian genocide *because they were Armenians* or the Germans who supported the Holocaust *because Jews were Jews*, except for the violence. To me, an attitude cannot be converted from being detestable into being admirable just because you remove violence from the equation. Mein Kampf is lamentable on its own, as is Geert Wilders' views.

A man with a mindset from the Middle ages that ignores all reason, analysis, and individualism (for he will not allow Muslims the freedom of individualism), Geert Wilders is the political incarnation of all that the Age of Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, wanted to put an end to in the civilized world. To even consider grouping great thinkers like Descartes, Locke, Voltaire, Hume, Kant, or Newton with a thinker like him would be akin to a farce.

Censorship is something specific that has a legal definition in Europe. No one was implying that he be censored.

* One possibility is that you felt that there was a need for an economy to have a lot of inexpensive labor to work *well*, that there's some way in which it just didn't operate effectively without a supply of inexpensive labor.  Mark Twain, the American author, took a similar position, and advocated for Chinese immigration to ensure a supply of inexpensive labor.

* Another possibility is that you were concerned about the politics of a society in which there isn't a tall sort of pyramid, that maybe labor unions start forming up and that you worry about that sort of thing.

* Another possibility is that you want some sort of industry or services to be available that requires inexpensive human labor: for example, having housekeepers or gardeners requires something like an India-type setup.

Additionnally that isn't what we are discussing. The point of discussion was whether Islamophobes or people with irrational fears of Muslims are racist or not? 

I would argue yes. Blacks aren't a single monolithic group. There are many groups that make up the Blacks. Yet people tend to see them as one and judge them based on it. 

&gt; sketchy ideological niches in Islam(with huge support from the moderate base.)

It is not part of original discussion but let's discuss it anyway. What makes you say that? What do we have to do to show that we do not support terrorists acts in anyway? Sharing some ideas with extremists does not mean support. There are many Europeans who would share some views with far-right/neonazi groups? These are sketchy ideological niches. By your definition, they get huge support from moderate base of Europe. 

I would argue that statements like these are Islamophobic. There is an irrational fear towards moderate Muslims caused by actions of the few. 

For example, if I started fearing the whites because the Charleston shooter, my fear is irrational, right? 


E: There has been attacks on the immigrant famillies by local people, albeit they were neonazi skinheads. So yes, it would be logical to fear persecution in their new country **by a few**. It would be irrational to fear persecution from the whole country without any signs.

&gt;It is not done to piss off the US. Yes, it might be a response to their spying, but the reasoning is clearly that what the US is doing cannot go on. It has to stop. And to help that along then Assange and Snowden are both key players.

Giving them asylum will not achieve that. It will only serve as a cheap comeback. This is especially obvious in the case of Snowden, who, far from being a key player, has nothing more to give. The only thing giving him asylum would achieve, would be to prevent the US from prosecuting him. If you are right and this is some kind of measured attempt at stemming American spying, then I can only conclude that the France would've (remember, this is all hypothetical) been quite misguided.

&gt;And as an addendum, there's nothing childish about giving people asylum to piss off the US anyway.

""The gift of Clauzel's French nationalist heritage.""

Surely, you didn't. We are either in a misunderstanding, or we both talk to deaf ears. The way I see it, you accused dClauzel of being a French nationalist, because he comments in both French and English. Hence my question about the correlation between multilingualism and nationalism. If you can give any other explanation as to why dClauzel is a French nationalist in your opinion, please do, as he never gave that vibe. I visit this sub quite often, and from what I've seen he seems to be pretty far from what a nationalist is.

&gt; I AM multilingual. I speak 4 languages. And yet, here I am, speaking English. Why does it seem so weird that I expect the same from others?

It's not weird and it's expected by nearly everyone in this sub imo. to speak English. And dClauzel does just that. He speaks English, *and* French. His comments are understandable for those who don't speak French, he offers a translation when it's needed. This is why I don't get the attitude shown in this thread. People could simply ignore the French text, and read only the English part. This is what I [originally pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b6prz/the_megathread_is_a_fucking_mess/csjklql?context=3), and [this is my opinion on this subject.](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3b6prz/the_megathread_is_a_fucking_mess/csjkgfm?context=3)


As for your accusation of me using straw man arguments, look at the original post, OP's comments, and the long list of people discussing multilingualism in this thread. Those are the things I intended to mock in our other conversation.

Exactly.

&gt; That situation gets even more complicated when you consider that intelligence agencies avoid their own laws by having the other agencies spy on their people and sharing that information. This isn't something that can be stopped by simply looking at domestic spying.

For one, it's a lot harder to spy on your own citizens, when you have to rely on a foreign intelligence service, you run the risk of a third party falsifying the information, to get you to act differently than normal, and you have to hope that they don't compromise your espionage. 

It's a hell of a lot harder than being the Securitate, and just knocking on any door you want in Bucharest, and strolling right in. 

You and I both know that without truly domestic surveillance, there's a hard limit on how much you can spy. Cell-phone 'stingrays' can't be set up across the globe, you have to set up a spoofing tower within the range of the real one you want to spoof, wiretaps, any kind of real-world action inherently has to be done on-site. 

If someone's in a Faraday room, with a mechanical typewriter, with muffled keys, all the Boundless Informants in the world can't help.

Germany is generally a very dog friendly place but double check with the landlord or realtor in any case. I guess finding a furnished apartment that allows dogs will a bit more difficult but not impossible.

&gt; I have a dog, and would love to bring her.

What breed? Some breeds ([Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Bull Terrier and crossbreeds\) are banned](http://www.zoll.de/EN/Private-individuals/Travel/Entering-Germany/Restrictions/Dangerous-dogs/dangerous-dogs.html) from importation in Germany. Apart from that the [importation procedure is pretty straightforward](http://www.germany.info/pets#topic1) – your pup needs to be chipped, vaxinated etc.

Vero. Ma non è un modello a caso. E' il modello che meglio aderisce alla realtà. Quindi il dimorfismo descrive meglio la realtà biologica del polimorfismo. (Magari l'hai capito finalmente ma lo specifico perché forse non è chiaro...)

&gt; Inoltre, se la neurologia si assestasse definitivamente sull'origine neurologica dell'identità di genere ciò non toccherebbe i modelli dei due corpi, ma aggiungerebbe una modellizzazione più profonda

E' già altamente improbabile che quello studio possa influenzare la neurologia, mi sembra quasi impossibile che possa andare ad influenzare una disciplina differente come la biologia. Non impossibile, ma quasi impossibile.

Ti invito solo a guardare la Scienza nel suo complesso, e a non soffermarti su un solo studio a causa di un wishful thinking, ignorando tonnellate di altra roba.

Esattamente come quando guardavi lo 0.00005% della popolazione mondiale per ignorare il 99%. Guarda il quadro generale, non il minuscolo dettaglio che soddisfa il tuo wishful thinking! 

&gt; Questo è utile per trattare di transessualismo

Boh, la biologia dice che un transessuale è biologicamente maschio o biologicamente femmina. Il transessualismo, secondo l'attuale biologia, non ha origine né basi biologiche, né è distinguibile dal punto di vista biologico.

Per parlare di transessualismo devi passare alla psicologia, ad esempio.

Magari il concetto di sesso biologico evolverà, che ne so, ma mi sembra un'eventualità estremamente remota ed improbabile.

&gt; E sì. Quello è un principio di autorità. Esatto. Lo stesso principio d'autorità che usa chiunque si appelli alla comunità scientifica. 

Lo stesso principio di autorità che mi accusavi di usare. Schizofrenia dialettica?

(Usare il consenso scientifico non è principio di autorità. Non mi fido della Scienza perché l'ha detto Caio, mi fido della Scienza perché viene fatta tramite un certo metodo... E' ben diverso!)

&gt;Ovvero, se tu fai un ragionamento, quello deve essere confutato da un punto di vista logico, ma se tu mi dici ""secondo me è così"" senza darmi un perchè, io ti dico ""perchè dovrei credere alla tua opinione e non a quella di chi ne sa qualcosa??"". La vera fallacia logica sarebbe stata quindi se tu mi avessi detto ""secondo me è così perchè questo e questo e quindi questo"" e io ti avessi risposto ""si, ma questo studioso pensa questo, quindi quello che dici è sbagliato"".

Stiamo discutendo, amico. Ognuno porta qualche opinione personale e qualche fonte. Rilassati.

 On a more serious note, who are we kidding here? This desire to not ""appear"" islamophobic is ridiculous. And no not because Islam is the enemy of the West.......but because that stuff actually exists. When I was living in Germany (am Armenian), I was asked for identification, papers, etc, regularly, at times out of a group of ""real"" Germans. The only thing more insulting was that it was now ""OK"" because hey he's an Armenian Christian they don't cause us problems. Not to mention, bring up a Roma and watch European ""multiculturalism"" crumble...

Bigoted views, and racial and religious prejudice are a real problem, and sweeping it under the rug closes our eyes to both sides: *there are issues in Islam, and in the cultures and worldviews entering europe.* There are also glaring issues with *European perspectives on race and religion* (like targeting an Armenian because of his *looks*, but then apologizing because his *religions/ethnic* identity is not the one which you meant to target) ... To sweep everything under the rug, and use vague, archaic things like ""attandant"" or whatever it was, to sidestep realities and avoid shit makes it so neither side is addressed or rectified. 

Both immigrants and Europeans have a lot of introspection and realization to do, but this approach denies both groups any hope, and breeds the growth of places like /r/european.

Are 70% of Turkish youth in the Netherlands radicals? are they not true Muslims?

Note that this is in a country with happiness, freedom and equality _out the proverbial ass_, incredibly high standard of living. And while I see antisemitic attacks every month or so, I've NEVER seen a violent attack perpetrated against Muslims, distrust? sure, but that seems kinda logical after seeing ""true muslims"" murder your countrymen for being white. (or your neighborhood Kosher Butcher for being a rat.)

And, this is most important: 

While the ""moderate muslims"" are out protesting, not against the attack, no, because they feel sad that people blame the cause of the issue.




Tacit support, while the opposite is requested (Speak out against these crimes without trying to play the victim card, just once, you can do it!), is still support, even worse if ""Some values"" are shared.

Your edit is interesting; because that would make every act of anti-Muslim sentiment 100% legitimized, as Muslims just have murdered a score of people in the name of the religion just today.
It would also justify the entire playbook of Israel, which made me smile.

My last paragraph is A-OK in my book, just look at the Jewish exodus from Arab lands, for instance, or the ethnic cleansing committed by the Jordanians in East Jerusalem.
E: Please disprove this by showing me the human rights record of a Muslim Country in the Levant/Middle east that treats it minorities as if they are people, and not just subjugated animals.
Saying: ""its wrong"" just makes me think you are yet another Muslim that knows dick all about his faith yet is a horrible demagogue about it.


E2: honestly, I was _really_ hoping for a reply to:

&gt; Or probably more on the mark: what if I called you a Jewophobe for being anti-Israel/Pro-Palestine (Essentially the same unless you are for a fair two state solution.)

Mainland europe has just open fields or maybe a small river that seperate each others. Borders could be a decent place to take unwanted immigrants if they were taken all the way to their native country (or alike) - and the same thing was also done if/when they have entered the country.

Do you think borders are useless?. I mean the apperantly useless EU border that apperantly are so useless that it kills thousands a year. The Turkisk/Greece border or Serbian borders or Iranian borders?. 

Because you talk like they dont exists - and if europe just had a guard at internal EU border roads it will solve something.

Personally i think you can only stop unwanted immigrant it they dont have a reason to come. As long as they are more or less accepted when they are here - and are better off than at home - they will come. 

The World is also highly mobile - not many are bound to a farm anymore.

Polish rules on example of soft s:

ś - when not followed by vowel

sia, sią, sie, się, sio, sió, siu - 'i' is mute, s is soft

si - s is soft

sja, sją, sje, sję, sji, sjo, (sjó,) sju - s is not soft, j is pronounced

sija, siją, sije, siję, sijo, (sijó,) siju - this way both s is soft and i pronounced before vowel.

same for ź and ć

ń is more complicated in last two cases as it is still followed by i (eventually double i), but never mind it, as this rule is pointless anyway

other soft sounds are considered allophones with their basic sounds in polish, but they'd be probably used similarly to s, z, c",null,0,null,1435348600,null,0,false,0,csjrxcj,null,t3_3b6ciw,null,t1_csjrxcj,null,t1_csjh93p,null,null,null,1437374735,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Even if a country such as low GDP it can still have high employment, decent relative living standards, and crucially stability/predictability in the market. 

All those countries you cite need to (and will) catch up with the other EZ countries asap to make a single currency work though. that's why initially needed a two-tier currency, gradually working towards a EMU.

null,false,HappyReaper,null,null,null,"I agree 100%. What we have over most of the western world are societies based off democratic (to varying extents) electoral systems combined with authoritarian governance systems, which leaves the power of the people as little more than a convenient illusion.

A real representative democracy must have guarantees that there is a correspondence (both for decisions that are made and those that are not) between the will of the population and the actions of the government representing them. This requires:

* First and foremost, direct democracy checks. They are the only way to really provide such a guarantee, as a way for citizens to override the decisions of rogue governments. This can take the form, for instance, of citizens being able to call for referendums when an initiative (or a protest against existing legislation) gathers enough support.

* Transparency. There can be no secrets about the way public money is spent, as well as any relevant data for people to have an exact picture of how their country is being run. Unless there is an extremely good reason for it (plus those exceptions being known and accepted by the population), all data relating to governance should be available to all.
 
* Public debate. All sides of current matters should be guaranteed unbiased representation in state media. Right now, in several European countries state media is not much more than government propaganda. In a democratic country where the population is to have more than illusory power, such a situation cannot be allowed.

Other extremely important elements are:

* Education. Making it available to all in the best (and most unbiased) way possible should be a priority. Educated citizens are less likely to be swayed by propaganda and fallacious discourse.

* Contractual electoral programs. It should be plainly impossible for a party to run on a premise and then rule on another one. Even when the population can deny those policies or kick a government from office through referendum, it just makes no democratic sense. Measures against populism (understood as gaining the support of the people by promising policies one has no intention to pursue) should be present; they could be in the form of legally binding electoral programs (""if we win, these policies will be voted in parliament/referendum"", or ""during our mandate, we will not raise X tax""). This probably shouldn't be mandatory for the whole program, but parts of it that aren't contractual could then more easily be dismissed as lies by voters.

You're obviously trying to make a correlation between them, their motivations are obviously far from the same.

&gt;Giving them asylum will not achieve that. It will only serve as a cheap comeback.

I'm not saying it is sufficient, but it is certainly a start.

&gt;This is especially obvious in the case of Snowden, who, far from being a key player, has nothing more to give.

Snowden is symbol now, it's not about whether or not he is useful. If France gives him asylum they are actually saying they give other asylum seekers in the same conditions asylum as well, which is a very good thing.

&gt;Yes! Yes, there is! If that's you motive then it's nothing but childish.

I just explained to you why it isn't, but I suppose it hasn't quite made its way in.

&gt;I might be able to pass this it of as such because that's what it is.

Also, these types of incursions are not always that sinister as they sound, as there are instances when e.g. weather or just a small navigational mistake is the main cause for accidentally drifting into a foreign airspace.

Nevertheless, Sweden and Finland are known to have a policy to publish any and all incursions.

Bonus: apparently the latest Russian incursion into the Finnish airspace happened today. [Source](http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1435292729691?jako=d1ca2bba93694c35587e3b45e8cd5eb0&amp;ref=tw-share) (in Finnish: IL-76 at 14.15, South of Porvoo).

Denmark will have a pure Venstre (Liberal) government with Lars Løkke Rasmussen as Prime Minister.

That is clear after a final meeting between the four party leaders in the [right-wing] ""blue bloc"" this evening, where the last details between Venstre, the Danish People's Party, the Liberal Alliance, and the Conservatives were polished.

""It is my assessment that it will be possible to create a Venstre government under my leadership that will enjoy backing in the Folketing [Parliament]"", says Lars Løkke Rasmussen in front of the Landstingssal where the negotiations have taken place.

**Sunday**

Shortly before, Løkke was spotted on the roof terrace close by the Venstre secretariat where he was getting himself a cigarette on top of the exhausted negotiation process. He is now ready to get into his working uniform.

""I will not finish the work of making the basis for a government. I will spend the rest of tonight and tomorrow on that. And then I will inform her Majesty the Queen that I conclude that I can create a government,"" Løkke says, who expects that he can present the government and a new basis for the government on Amalienborg on Sunday.

Before, the three other blue party leaders had also left the meeting and expected Løkke to create a government alone.

""We do not need to be far from there being made a new government. But it is Lars Løkke Rasmussen who has to make his conclusions,"" Kristian Thulesen Dahl [of the Danish People's Party] said when he left the meeting.

Lars Løkke has been working intensely to create a government throughout the last week.

Yet in recent days it has been quite clear that only the Liberal Alliance were truly ready to join Løkke's government.

According to Anders Samuelsen [party leader of the Liberal ALliance], the Venstre government will present ""the most ambitious expectations for the reduction of marginal taxation in the history of Denmark.""

The new Løkke government will be the smallest since Poul hartlings pure Venstre government after the landslide election of 1973.

**For the sake of readers on /r/europe: Venstre received 19.5% of the votes in this year's election. That is 34 seats and a position as the third largest party in the country, following the Danish People's Party with 37 seats and the Social Democrats with 47 seats. He is to be Prime Minister because a majority of parties with a total of 52.3% of the popular vote recommend him as the Prime Minister.**",null,0,null,1435350032,null,0,1435350268,0,csjsttg,null,t3_3b8diz,null,t1_csjsttg,null,t3_3b8diz,null,null,null,1437536276,null,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6,null

null,false,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,null,"Hi, 

As a moderator I'm just gonna provide a quick explanation of the way we see things. 

Very little of what we do is censoring. 99% of content which we remove, is removed for reasons that have nothing to do with the opinions it espouses. It's usually stuff like **editorialising, spam and lacking sources**. This is 99% of what us moderators do, and we do a pretty good job of keeping this stuff away IMHO.

Now, **brigading** is also very important and it is very difficult to counter act and it takes up a disproportionate amount of our time. When we believe threads being brigaded from outside, by groups with a particular opinion (and we now that Storm front and others do this to our subreddit specifically), we *have* to act. Because what is happening there is *not free speech*. When a brigade is happening, the speech is about as free as trying to have a reasonable conversation whilst a crowd of people around you shout so loud that your voice is drowned out. In these instances, you need moderation to pro-actively step in and ensure that free speech can take place. Free speech is not simply an absence of formal restrictions. There are also practical restrictions, like actually ensuring that your voice can be heard. This is where some degree of moderation is necessary, because if it was left purely to its own devices, then we would be constantly brigaded and no genuine discussion would take place.  

Connected to this is why we do **megathreads**. It's very easy for one issue to dominate the sub's front page, and for it to dominate the front page for a very long time. You could see this with the Ukraine Crisis for months, and this is happening now with immigration. Very little discussion of anything else can take place because we're being drowned out by the flood of small news stories which are part of one big story. But we want to ensure that not only a diversity of opinion can be achieved, but also a diversity of news (and even of types of content that aren't news). This is why we do **megathreads**. It's not to sweep things under the rug. It's to bring attention to it, and to focus that attention in once place. By focusing the attention, it allows other news stories to blossom whilst there is a big main story as well. Now, today it may not have been carried out in the most effective way possible, and we'll try and do better in future, but you can see what we were trying to do. I'm thankful that Clauzel took the prerogative to make that post, even though it wasn't perfectly carried out. 

We also remove the stuff **which advocates violence**, because advocating violence is essentially the same thing as committing a violent act. We don't want that sort of thing to be spread around here. We do not want to be facilitators of violence and pain and suffering. Do not go anywhere near that. But connected to this is the idea of hate speech. As much as it displeases me, there are many movements which advocate violence against people based on race. Virtually all of the things which we remove because of their advocacy of violence are related to race. You can discuss race as much as you want, but if you go anywhere near even thinking about mixing violence in with it, then you can go somewhere else. 

Lastly, as a general response to all the complains we get, I'd like to point out that the *only* time you hear about our work is when something bad happens or we make a mistake. And yes. We make mistakes. We are human too. The thing is, there's several of us working on here every day, doing work that you never see, which ensures that this subreddit operates smoothly and continuously. You may not think much of it, but that has an enormous impact on the quality of this subreddit, even though you never hear about it.

This is a problem with your labor laws. Don't you have minimum wage that equals minimum social contributions? The ""problem"" will exist despite where the workers come from. And you ignore the fact how much is irrelevant because they aren't going to *be* a lot of young people around to pay those pensions. Low social contributions &gt; none.

&gt; they will have to compete with Marek, Muhammad, and Karim who are willing to dwell 4 people a room and live on canned food from Lidl. 

Last time I checked Romania is a European country that is part of the EU..so what Muhammad has to do with it?

&gt;But what else? Middle eastern expats often, per tradition, have much more children. However, these children are not really well integrated in all cases. This leads to many problems.

Higher birth rate is always equal with low life index. Every time the standard of living rises, births fall down  irrelevant of culture, religion or location (see [China](http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/Side%20bar%20Pages/Buttons/Index%20Buttons/clip_image002.gif) , [India](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/IndiaIBRdata.jpg/280px-IndiaIBRdata.jpg), [Egypt and assorted Middle East countries](http://www.prb.org/images08/patterns-of-fertility.gif) ) . 

Even if it was the case, and for some reason people mutate into UK into birthing machines, this means a lot of young people to work in 20 years (see my first point).

&gt; Tacit support, while the opposite is requested (Speak out against these crimes without trying to play the victim card, just once, you can do it!), is still support, even worse if ""Some values"" are shared.

Again how many times should Muslims say that we don't support them? For every idiots who support ISIS, there is a score who hate them. But nonetheless you won't hear me. Even when we condemn terrorist idiots like you come and accuse us such things. There is nothing I can do to change your mind, can I? 

&gt; Your edit is interesting; because that would make every act of anti-Muslim sentiment 100% legitimized, as Muslims just have murdered a score of people in the name of the religion just today. It would also justify the entire playbook of Israel, which made me smile.

Do you think out of your ass? I said that the actions of the few does not justify distrust against the many. And you responded by saying that actions of a few does justify prejudice towards many. 

I mean seriously. How can you such an idiot? I guess it is our fault, too. Since the filthy immigrants sucked up the money and you couldn't get an education, right?

I listed three countries who had one thing in common. You'd have to try really hard to get that to mean that they're ""the same country"". And yes, their motives are quite obviously the same. Neither are known for they love of openness and human rights, but both are known for hating the US.

&gt;I'm not saying it is sufficient, but it is certainly a start.

How? How is it a start?

&gt;Snowden is symbol now, it's not about whether or not he is useful. If France gives him asylum they are actually saying they give other asylum seekers in the same conditions asylum as well, which is a very good thing.

It would be a good thing, but they're not going to do it, and the only reason this one politician brought it up now seems to be to ""get back"" at the US.

&gt;I just explained to you why it isn't, but I suppose it hasn't quite made its way in.

No you didn't, which is why I'm stating it again. Doing things simply to piss someone of, or to get back, is childish. It's what children do, becuase it's childish. It has no place in any functioning legal system because it unworthy, because it's childish. I really don't get how this is so hard to understand. It doesn't matter if you think it's justified. Every child in every sandbox who felt wronged has felt justified in his or her rage-induced revenge plot. They never are.

&gt;The US government is the one I was referring to, obviously. And it is far from harmless to piss off the US. See Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran etc. Just because you can do it then it does not mean it is without danger.

I gave you several examples, of which only France has any kind of bite. Your list is lacking though. None of the were invaded because they pissed the US of in a manner comparable to what were talking about. Iraq is a possible exception, but that's balanced out by Iran which is basically untouched.

However, if you look at the details, it is less convincing. 

- First: you have to compare PPP GDP, not nominal GDP.

- Second: A 25% reduction in GDP would not be that bad if everyone would be affected. Except for the extremely poor, everyone would have to postpone consumption and that's it. This is not how it works, though. 
For once, prices have come down way more slowly than GDP. So people lose real income 

- Third: it leads to a fragmentation of society where a medical doctor might be forced to accept a lower salary but a lot of less educated workers end on the dole for years. And without a working social security, that's pretty tough.

So, in the end, a median income in a country with low wages and low prices can have a similar purchasing power as in Greece (relatively high prices) and a sudden reduction in GDP via high employment will lead to a fragmentation of society where the lucky ones run a taverna in Mykonos and will not feel their standard of living decrease while others have to live on the street.",null,0,null,1435351178,null,0,false,0,csjtjvo,null,t3_3b6wxh,null,t1_csjtjvo,null,t1_csjlq1c,null,null,null,1437375665,null,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16,null

&gt;How? How is it a start?

I seriously have to explain the meaning of the word ""start"" to you?

&gt;Doing things simply to piss someone of, or to get back, is childish.

It's childish when you know there is no consequences. When there is consequences it is not childish, it is a gamble. You can literally debase any act into being ""childish"" with some ludicrous narrative, but that doesn't make it so. You're ignoring the realities of the situation just so you can paint it as ""childish"".

&gt;I gave you several examples, of which only France has any kind of bite. Your list is lacking though. None of the were invaded because they pissed the US of in a manner comparable to what were talking about.

That wasn't the point of the list. It wasn't to say ""The US will totally invade them!"", if that was so I would not include Iran. I brought up the list to show just how dangerous it is to piss off the US. And let's not forget that the invasion of Afghanistan was because the Taliban did in fact piss off the US.

&gt;To call the US government ""tyrannical"" is a joke and reveals a serious lack of perspective.

Apparently, two fellow passengers (of African descent) didn’t own valid tickets. After trying to hide in the toilet, the conductor was confronting them in the undivided compartment. Since they already tried to flee and were unwilling/unable to pay the penalty of 40 €, the conductor wanted to detain them.

However, the conductor himself is apparently due to insurance reasons not allowed by the train company to detain someone. Of course, the fellow passengers were unable flee a moving train, but the conductor still tried to prevent them from getting away.

There is a German law that is commonly referred to as *Jedermannparagraph* (§127 StPO, “Everyone paragraph”). It basically states, that any person witnessing a crime is allowed to detain the suspect, if he is on the run and his identity can not be determined.

The conductor apparently figured, that another fellow passenger could detain them instead, but of course no one was willing to detain them. Finally, the conductor began to try to convince the other passengers of detaining them, talking of civil courage, but he basically tried to stir up hatred against foreigners.

In this case, other passengers also began to defend them, though not as committed as in the experiment described in the article. No one detained them. The two passengers without a ticket were finally handed over to the federal police at the next station.

And not out of any debts, that just started coming back. The others decided to cut &amp; run ; and it was essentially :

1°) guys known to take the money in the register for themselves

2°) Syriza

3°) golden dawn nazis

So, which one was it gotta be ?

&gt; the economy has now been in a recession

Yes, due to the debts newly maturing set by the govs before them; something Syriza has 0 direct control over (bar, of course, negociations, like those currently going on). Say, you borrow a ton of money and build a house with it (the post junta infrastructure they built with it amongst other things). Then you go away and give the debts to your kids. Now your kids are looking at eviction and have to find billions everywhere. You blame them for ""bad management"". Really. Now that house was probably needed, but let's try finding a solution shall we ?

&gt;  tax evasion is up

Something to crack down hard upon, agreed

&gt; other. Why not push for combating tax evasion for example? 

100% agreed, and last i heard even Syriza agreed. However, the creditors (namely the IMF to point a finger) don't give a hoot about it and only want a bigger VAT, force greece to cut pensions more and rising new taxes on the poorest. Of course, that did stuck a bit.

&gt;  To date, they haven't requested an updated list of potential tax evaders from Switzerland...

That, however, is an excellent idea. Maybe we (well, we westerners europeans *cough*) could look to find them an up to date list just after the negociations in a few days ?

How do you distinguish threads being brigaded from other ones? Reddit does not provide moderators any technical abilities to do that. You consider threads as being brigaded basing only on your personal impression.

According to my observations, it looks the following way. When in some thread, comments which you **personally** don't like get many upvotes, than you consider this thread as _being brigaded_. And remove these comments or the whole thread.

The most prominent examples are topics about Islam, immigration or multiculturalism. When comments against immigration or criticizing multiculturalism get upvoted, you consider this thread as being brigaded.

Bah oui évidemment. D'ailleurs c'est une très large majorité des musulmans en France. Restent environ 20% de gros cons qui selon les sondages veulent l'application de la charia en France. 

C'est pour ça que je dis que n'importe qui de normalement constitué se désolidarise du Coran.

&gt;A ce que je sache tous les cathos sont pas mega influencés par les histoires de Sodom et Gomorrhe.

Bah c'est différent d'une part parce que le nouveau Testament c'est déjà un bouquin qui dit que l'ancien Testament est tout pourri.

 En plus c'est clairement dit que c'est des hommes qui l'ont écrit et pas Dieu en personne. D'où les différentes versions des mêmes événements selon les évangiles. 

Enfin, à nouveau grosse différence, tu as un pape pour les catholiques qui dit explicitement ce qui est officiellement la doctrine avec tout le clergé pour l'expliquer. 

&gt;Le problème, c'est certaines interpretations d'un bouquin, on peut pas juger toutes les croyances basées dessus d'un coup. 

Le problème de base c'est quand même le bouquin. S'il n'y avait pas des appels à la violence et des passages entiers complètement misogynes il n'y aurait pas de justification religieuse.

As for paying more of it's taxes, Greek taxes are the highest in Europe and companies don't pay one tax every year, they pay 1.5. The current year's and half of the next year's. So the current 26(or 22?)% +26/2, totaling to 39%. Considering the added charges and the heavy taxation of the money kept in the bank for a rainy day you end up, if i recall well, with a total taxation of 55 or 60%. To lower that to the least possible scenario, perhaps 45% means that a company more or less works for the government half of the time and not for itself, which is crazy. This is one of the reasons why the economy is doing bad, and frankly, why would it go well? Who in his right mind would subject himself on sucha  taxation, without counting the social charges, the environmental charges, the equipment/maintenance costs without even counting raw materials, if applicable. And the creditors wanted to raise that initial 22 or 26% to 29! In the end where would it be, 65% total? I doubt functioning European companies get more than 40% final.

EDIT : I don't have any knowledge over this, but how many people pay their taxes in, say Slovenia (or any other, doesn't matter)? In France they recently stated that about 45% of the population paid taxes, the rest was under the threshold of... 16k euros a year i think. So there's a clear differentiation between tax evasion and not being taxed. I have no recent figures but if i recall well, tax evasion in Greece was reduced quite a lot, at least for the normal people, and there have been stories of big heads getting in prison for unpaid dues.

In all i don't think that today Greece is problematic on the amount of tax payers meeting their obligations, rather than the actual taxation being nonsensical, plus some European laws and charges which tends to not help, not only in Greece but in the rest of Europe, as France (since i'm from there) has many problems in the Agricultural sector because of them.",null,0,null,1435353248,null,0,1435353695,0,csjutya,null,t3_3b6wxh,null,t1_csjutya,null,t1_csjt8kz,null,null,null,1437376571,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

We do panic because it is spectacular, and that is precisely the point of terrorism. Terrorism was coined during the French Revolution, and the idea was to use shocking executions to ""terrorise"" the traitors and the enemies. Nowadays it is used by groups like ISIS or Al-Qaida precisely because they don't have the military power to actually harm us in any concrete way. They can only harm us by terrorising us, to hurt our morale and make us think twice before doing certain things, like fighting against them abroad, or publishing caricatures of Muhammad.

No. Just as there's irresponsible borrowing, there's irresponsible lending. You can't have one without the other. 

The Greek economy should've went into default 5 years ago when the crisis first hit, but Europe insisted on a bailout programme for the banking sector. Less than 11% of the debt Greece holds now has actually gone towards its state functions - the other 89% has gone towards the socialisation of private debt of bankers and speculators across Europe, that is, things the Greek government holds no responsibility for. 

Ireland is in a similar situation where it's responsible for 11% of Europe's banking debt but is paying for 42% of it. 

It's easy to forget how this crisis started, it was some 6 or 7 years ago, but it doesn't like on the general population of any single state in Europe, it lies with the gamblers of Europe.

No, only how that would be one, which is what I asked.

It's childish if it's childish. The risks make absolutely no difference.

This sentence doesn't mean anything.

No, I'm seeing this hypothetical situation for what it is. Denying a country something to get back at it is childish. It doesn't matter who does it, or how much risk is invooved. It's only the motive that matters. If anyone is ignoring anything it's you, ignoring what's plain to see becuase of an obvious bias against the US.

I already addressed that. They were not attacked because they pissed the US off.

&gt;And let's not forget that the invasion of Afghanistan was because the Taliban did in fact piss off the US.

No no no, they were invaded because they **attacked** the US. They'd been yelling death to America for some time and were not invaded. Simply pissing them of by being annoying brats is not enough.

&gt;""And when the news of (the birth of) a female (child) is brought to any of them, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with inward grief! He hides himself from the people because of the evil of that whereof he has been informed. Shall he keep her with dishonor or bury her in the earth? Certainly, evil is their decision.""

Mais c'est vrai qu'il y a un lien entre l'extrémisme religieux et côté taré de la personnalité.

You need to compare beyond motive. It's a bloody country.

Define ""childish"". Because it seems extremely subjective to me. To me calling someone or something childish in derisive manner is actually childish.

&gt;This sentence doesn't mean anything.

Learn to read then.

&gt;No, I'm seeing this hypothetical situation for what it is.

No, you're not. You're ignoring every important detail to fit into a narrative of painting it as ""childish"" while it is anything but that. It's ridiculous.

&gt;I already addressed that. They were not attacked because they pissed the US off.

Yeah, Iran was not attacked because they pissed off the US. 

&gt;No no no, they were invaded because they attacked the US. They'd been yelling death to America for some time and were not invaded. Simply pissing them of by being annoying brats is not enough.

That's semantics. They attacked the US and in effect pissed them off, causing them to invade. In other words, it's dangerous to piss off the US. It doesn't matter how you do it.

&gt;No it doesn't. Stop kidding yourself. It shows the depthness of perspective of an angsty middle class teenager.

Yes, according to the one trying to describe any world view that doesn't agree with his as ""childish"" and ""that of a teenager"". I'm sure your perspective is quite valuable.

Either you believe that all men and women are created equally, or you don't believe in equality under the law. Today the Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution to state that marriage is a fundamental right that all citizens should have the option to enjoy. It's for this reason that Obama called the ruling today ""a step towards a more perfect Union"", which is the ultimate mission of the US: progress is never complete and we must always keep pressing onward.

Pour lutter contre Daech, il faudrait déjà que Facebook, twitter et Youtube fassent un peu de modération (les libéraux vont me détester) : il y a encore des vidéos et des comptes qui trainent. Facebook = 15 000 salariés (de mémoire) pour 1,3 Mds de profils. Ca n'est pas assez.

Je ne te fais pas non plus le couplet sur les hommes politiques qui cumulent les mandats ou planquent du fric dans ton pays (Cahuzac...) et qui devraient montrer l'exemple.

It's a long process, without doubt. Doesn't mean you shouldn't follow it to the end though.

&gt;How do you want to make yourself independent of US troops? You cannot do that without massive anti american rhetoric and people then have to decide if they hate the US or the military more. This just seems like a very good way to destabilize european safety, way out of proportion to one or two guys that are wantedfor whatever reason. 

You really don't need to do the whole anti-American rhetoric thing, you just need to stress the importance of a country being able to protect itself, or look towards working with neighboring nations for a joint force to do the job. 

&gt;Also if you take in these wanted people you force the US to react which in itself again possibly destabilizes european safety / economy. The same goes for ignoring embargoes. Why would you want to force a conflict if you don't have to?

Why you not be a slave? You don't have to force a conflict slave master.

Documents German investigators obtained by the ARD's investigative journalist Benjamin Best documented that Davor Šuker and Ante Šapina in 2009 have conducted such talks in more additional occasions. Obviously they did not have even as an afterthought following them and eavesdropping German police. In an article titled ""The dark shadow over Davor Suker,"" which was published on Friday, German ARD, claimed that the police had intercepted numerous telephone conversations and revised text messages Šuker and Šapine.

&gt;By giving Assange and Snowden asylum, they perform an action that could be the start of several actions in the same venue to come

That doesn't answer the question. What difference would it make? They both already have asylum.

&gt;Define ""childish"". Because it seems extremely subjective to me. To me calling someone or something childish in derisive manner is actually childish.

1. of, like, or appropriate to a child.
2. Silly and immature.

To me, typing the equivalence of "" he who smelt it dealt it"" is childish. Using the dictionary definition is not.

&gt;Learn to read then.

There's nothing wrong with my reading comprehension. You argument can be changed to be about anything, making it arguing the irrelevance of itself. It really doesn't mean anything. It's just words.

&gt;Yeah, Iran was not attacked because they pissed off the US.

Iran wasn't attacked, period. The others were, but not because they pissed the US off.

&gt;That's semantics. They attacked the US and in effect pissed them off, causing them to invade. In other words, it's dangerous to piss off the US. It doesn't matter how you do it.

Are you kidding me? Are you really accusing me of arguing semantics when you're tying yourself into knot trying to make an act of war fit into the same category as giving asylum? Who's playing the semantics game here? It sure as hell isn't me.

&gt;Yes, according to the one trying to describe any world view that doesn't agree with his as ""childish"" and ""that of a teenager"".

I haven't described any worldview as childish. I've described actions coupled with motives as childish. And the persepcitve was that of an *angsty* teenager, not just any teenager.

&gt; The manual defines them this way: ""In general, journalists are civilians. However, journalists may be members of the armed forces, persons authorized to accompany the armed forces, or unprivileged belligerents."" [...]

&gt; ""That last sentence simply reflects that, in certain cases, persons who act as journalists may be members of the armed forces, persons authorized to accompany the armed forces or unprivileged belligerents rather than civilians. The fact that a person is a journalist does not prevent that person from becoming an unprivileged belligerent.""

Soweit gehts also nur um Journalisten in Kriegsgebieten. Allerdings wird es auch auf ""Propagandisten"" erweitert, und da wird es etwas bedenklich:

&gt; Some people might characterize the persons who put out Inspire magazine as ‘journalists,’ but ‘propagandist’ would be more apt,” Col. Sowers said. “Members of nonstate armed groups, such as al Qaeda, who also do work that could be characterized as journalism, would continue to be unprivileged belligerents notwithstanding their work as journalists. *As another example, enemy spies that used journalism as a cover would likely also be considered unprivileged belligerents if they are caught while engaged in espionage.*

Beim Generalstreik von 1948 gab es keine Tote - und obendrein waren die Streikenden in einem Kernpunkt erfolgreich:

&gt;Konrad Adenauer, Vorsitzender der CDU, forderte kurze Zeit nach dem Streik Ludwig Erhard in einem Telegramm auf, mit allen „zur Verfügung stehenden Mitteln gegen unbegründete Preissteigerungen“ vorzugehen und die „Angleichung zurückgebliebener Löhne und Bezüge an das Preisniveau zu beschleunigen“.

But how do you change it and why would you want to change it? Military spending is money you can't spend otherwise and then your political opponents will attack you for this immediately and they have support for this in the general population. 

Also I don't see how the concept of War is Peace (according to Orwell) matters here or do you propose a state akin to the cold war where you propagate that gearing up militarily to face a foe like the Soviet Union? Do you seriously suggest to supress the opinion of the population of a country or to use political propaganda to twist it for the political goal of getting rid of american dominance? 

&gt;I'm not suggesting that you open fire on them either. I'm suggesting you build up your forces and secure your borders and that of your neighbors so the US isn't needed and thus can be told to go home.

But realistically no country can field an army strong enough to even compare to the US's one. This would also require to build a stronger nuclear deterrent and it would only open up a possible scenario where the US and europe do not stand together in my oppinion. It also is a massive financial endavour and one that will be really unpopular so there will be no political will for it.

&gt;The NSA did not just spy on other agencies. They literally decided to spy on everyone who uses the Internet.

Yes they did/do. The question is what do they do with the information because this touches orwellian states.

Is it ? As far as I know, the point of a megathread is to collect every comments about an event to avoid the subreddit getting filled with posts about it. Is it an absolute necessity for the OP to be updated ?

&gt;His arrogance is displayed in every single post he makes, by the fact that even though it has been pointed out to him that posting first in French and only after in English is very distruptive, he refuses to change. Even so much as to reverse the order of the languages in his posts, so they can start with the English half.

What difference does that even make, in both case, you'll have to skip over a paragraph. Besides, he does uses italics to differentiate both languages, it's pretty easy to immediatly switch to the english one. The worst thing I can see here is stubbornness, but that's not enough to qualify for a demod.

&gt;Except for the fact that he has removed threads that shouldn't have been removed

That's quite subjective. Others mods have half-justified those removals as far I know, so it's not even about him alone.

He did create one. Most of what is wrong with it is bad english, but that falls in with the point I already agreed with.

Why? Because you want control over your own country. If you don't have a military it literally means you are at the mercy of whoever protects you. That's not a good position to be in when it comes to negotiation.

&gt;Also I don't see how the concept of War is Peace (according to Orwell) matters here or do you propose a state akin to the cold war where you propagate that gearing up militarily to face a foe like the Soviet Union?

I brought it up because you literally change the narrative to be anything you want, even something as absurd as that, if you are skilled enough.

&gt;Do you seriously suggest to supress the opinion of the population of a country or to use political propaganda to twist it for the political goal of getting rid of american dominance? 

No.

&gt;But realistically no country can field an army strong enough to even compare to the US's one. This would also require to build a stronger nuclear deterrent and it would only open up a possible scenario where the US and europe do not stand together in my oppinion. It also is a massive financial endavour and one that will be really unpopular so there will be no political will for it.

You don't need to compare it to the US one. You just need to be able to fend for yourself.

Is somebody else's well-being a threat to the good functioning of society? 


The silent abuse that the LGBT suffers in my country could, for some, make up a final, key motivation to leave. A state needs to do whatever's possible to protect its people, not chase them away, be it indirectly. 


Same-sex marriage is, in the first place, based on love, and then on politics. If others are indeed allowed to have an opinion on things, it's not the same with love, because the latter only concerns 2 people, and only they hold the right to vote.

Or at least so they should.

First off: package it yourself. Don't buy their boxes, convenient but expensive.

Express international is ""Colissimo"" and it's what they tried to sell you. FYI: it'll be 10% cheaper if [you buy it online and print the slip](https://www.colissimo.fr/affranchissementenligne) (22.52 EUR for 300g online). You'll having tracking and that's it. Also, FR to US takes 2-3 weeks.

Sending it as a non-express parcel: Paquet prioritaire international (8.90 EUR 500g, or 6 EUR for 250g). It's basically just a stamp and [you can print it online](https://pro.boutique.laposte.fr/montimbrenligne) or buy it directly at La Poste. I don't know how long shipping takes, no tracking (but I think it can be an option).

Last but not least, La Poste made a new rule in 2014 that anything thicker than 3cm may not be sent as a letter. Sadly, this was validated as legal by the ARCEP. Anyway, sending parcel or letter of 250g/500g is a one euro difference.

I could rant much more on La Poste poor attitude and pricing but I'll stop here.

EDIT: Paquet prioritaire international is actually reserved for professionals. Nevertheless, anyone can create a pro-account online (without any verification) [here](https://pro.boutique.laposte.fr/) and print out your own stamps. A [petition](https://secure.avaaz.org/fr/petition/LA_POSTE_Le_retour_du_petit_paquet_prioritaire_international_dans_le_bureau_de_poste/?pv=15) is online asking for La Poste to bring back this option for individuals (and not only companies)

&gt; La trahison qui était annoncée comme certaine mardi pour mercredi, puis pour aujourd’hui, n’a pas eu lieu. En écho à la foule athénienne, Tsipras a rapidement décidé de retirer les retraites de la table des négociations, malgré l’insistance virulente de Lagarde et les tapotements paternalistes sur la joue de Junker. De plus, Tsipras, de moins en moins adulte aux yeux des gérontocrates, a osé revenir à la charge pour obtenir une restructuration de la dette dans la durée et, au moins, les 7,2 milliards de prêts promis de longue date. Autrement dit, pas question d’aller encore siphonner les faibles réserves des comptes sociaux pour payer la facture du 30 juin au FMI (1,6 milliards), puis celle de juillet à la BCE...

&gt; Le seul qui semble content, c’est Wolfgang Schäuble, le ministre des finances allemand, qui rêve depuis longtemps du Grexit et qui rabâche, ce soir, qu’un accord s’éloigne « parce que les Grecs ont fait des pas en arrière ».

&gt; On peut citer également l’ancien premier ministre grec, Antonis Samaras, qui a réitéré son appel d’hier de former, de toute urgence, un gouvernement d’union nationale, avec à sa tête Yannis Stournaras, l’actuel gouverneur de la Banque de Grèce. D’autres aimeraient provoquer des élections anticipées en plein été, le 2 août par exemple. Bref, rien n’est calme à Athènes, ces jours-ci, et la droite espère bien débarrasser rapidement l’Europe de ce gouvernement atypique.

&gt; Cependant, un accord a minima peut encore aboutir, samedi (J-3) ou lundi (J-1). Auquel cas, il durerait sans doute jusqu’à fin septembre ou fin octobre. Et après ? Les conditions politiques d’une rupture seraient nettement différentes, côté grec. Par exemple, en annonçant à la rentrée un référendum sur la dette ou même sur la zone euro, ce qu’avait évoqué Tsipras dès le 27 avril. Une annonce pourrait avoir lieu pendant la rentrée sociale, suivie ou précédée du débat demandé par l’aile gauche de Syriza sur la dette (49 députés), un peu avant les grandes festivités du NON à Mussolini (28 octobre 1940), et surtout avant les dates anniversaires de l’insurrection contre les Colonels (17 novembre 1973) et du début des grandes émeutes (6 décembre 2008), qui promettent cette année d’être chaudes.

&gt; Sauf ? Sauf si accord n’est pas trouvé avant le soir du 30 juin. Auquel cas la Grèce serait automatiquement annoncée en défaut technique dès le début du mois d’août, au terme du « délai de grâce ». Nous en reparlerions plus en détails mardi premier juillet, si tel était le cas. Mais c’est peu probable.

&gt; Parions que la montagne accouchera d’une souris, encore une fois. Et que le problème se reposera, peut-être pour la dernière fois, à l’automne.

&gt; Et oui, rien n’est fini, Pujadas. Rien n’est fini ! Ce soir encore, c’est nous qui buvons le raki !

&gt; Santé à toutes celles et ceux qui nous soutiennent !

well, thats your opinion about it. some people have a different opinion on what legal stance official partnerships should and should not have. looking at the downvotes, some gays are obviously mad that their opinion isnt the only one. trying to act like the most open minded yet the most ignorant about it.

&gt;They won't stop being what they are, they won't stop living with their parteners, they won't cease to exist just because their marriage isn't approved, so why not make a small effort to contribute to their happiness - not as a minority, but as regular humans? Is somebody else's well-being a threat to the good functioning of society?

who forces anyone to marry someone else? nobody from what i know.

&gt;The silent abuse that the LGBT suffers in my country could, for some, make up the final, key motivation to leave the country. A state needs to do whatever's possible to protect its people, not chase them away, be it indirectly.

do you even know how many people are actually against gay relationships in private, while they might be all happy about it if asked on the street, just to appear as a more friendly person?

&gt;Same-sex marriage is, in the first place, based on love, and then on politics.

no. a relationship is based on love, marriage is based on politics, else the option for it wouldnt exist.

&gt;If others are indeed allowed to have a political opinion of things, it's not the same with love, because the latter only concerns 2 people, and only they hold the right to vote.

* _geht wohl nicht nur mir unfassbar auf den Sack_: Here we have a common phrase: _jemandem auf den Sack gehen_, which means to annoy someone. The _unfassbar_ just adds emphasis.

The whole thing basically means: _I'm probably not alone in feeling annoyed as hell by him pushing his agenda of spreading French everywhere_.

Greek interest rate payments as share of GDP [are very favourable](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11372369/Three-myths-about-Greeces-enormous-debt-mountain.html).

That means getting rid of the debt will not really be that much of a help. On the other hand, a strongly depreciated currency will make it even harder to pay for Greece's vital imports and it won't make its feeble exports much more competitive.

&gt; A working paper published by the European Central Bank concluded

&gt; &gt;    … that negotiated withdrawal from the EU would not be legally impossible even prior to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, and that unilateral withdrawal would undoubtedly be legally controversial; that, while permissible, a recently enacted exit clause is, prima facie, not in harmony with the rationale of the European unification project and is otherwise problematic, mainly from a legal perspective; that a Member State's exit from EMU, without a parallel withdrawal from the EU, would be legally inconceivable; and that, while perhaps feasible through indirect means, a Member State's expulsion from the EU or EMU, would be legally next to impossible.

&gt; In the legal literature, the question of whether a country can unilaterally leave the Eurozone without leaving the EU is controversial. Jens Dammann has taken the view that under certain conditions, it is possible for a Member State to end its membership in the Eurozone without leaving the European Union.

I don't think most people have any understanding of the situation. The Euro is a common currency, not a pegged currency. 

An EZ nation can't just decide to leave the Euro. If that were possible it  would jeopardize everyone else. Likewise a nation can't simply be kicked out of the EZ. And a you can't just kick a nation out of the EU. 

The Euro is not just fancy economic tool. It is part of our unity. It's not accidental that (save the couple of opt-outs) every country is bound to enter the Euro. 

People keep parroting ""Greece leaving the Euro""... it's not that simple. And it's not that simple, not by accident, but by by design.  And this is the reason why that if Greece leaves the Euro, it's not going to be pretty, and it's going to spell the end of the European project.

A lot of Christian people think that the term marriage is something sacred and can only describe the bond between men and woman. They think that their tradition is somehow insulted by allowing homosexual people to marry. I personally don't understand that as an atheist, but it's wrong to automatically assume that they are hostile toward gay people.

Accessoirement. en France, on ne se prive tout de même pas de taper sur l'Islam qui n'aurait pas des valeurs compatibles avec les notres. Il faut voir les unes du Point, de Valeurs Actuelles et de bon nombre d'hebdomadaires sur les arabes qui profitent des allocations en excisant leurs filles entre deux prières de rues où ils brulent le code pénal. 

Ce qui est intéressant, c'est de noter qu'actuellement, les musulmans, ce ne sont pas systématiquement des arabes, mais des français de souche qui se convertissent. La dernière news à ce sujet, c'était l'épicerie des deux abrutis qui avaient imposé des jours pour les femmes et d'autres pour les hommes, qui étaient des convertis dont le mec se prénomait tout de même Jean-Baptiste. Il y a une certaine ironie là dedans.

Non, il n'y a pas que des musulmans au chomage. Et il y a une énorme différentre entre une excuse et une explication. Nulle part je n'excuse les attentats, la violence ou le meurtre. Mais cela n'est pas pour cela que cela interdit de s'interroger sur les causes de cette radicalisation.

Comme je le disais, je vis dans un pays musulman, mais globalement riche, avec globalement, une société ouverte, des opportunités d'études et de travail pour tous. Et avec mes collègues musulmans, on plaisante de tout, on se fait des blagues de cul. Pourtant, ils font le ramadan, jeunent et font leurs cinq prières par jours. Alors comment se fait il qu'ici, il y ait peu de radicalisation ? Contrairement à l'Arabie Saoudite qui a connu de nombreux attentats ? La différence, c'est qu'ici, globalement, on vit dans une société qui offre un avenir à sa population, contrairement à l'Arabie Saoudite fortement touchée par le chomage des jeunes. Tiens... Tu commences à voir un petit parallèle là ? Juste un petit hein.

&gt; Purtroppo la versione raccontata da Riccardo Luna è molto diversa da come andarono le cose in realtà. Nel febbraio del 2008, per puro miracolo, lessi su una rivista del settore che Conde Nast, stava per portare in Italia Wired, testata alla quale ero abbonato dal primo numero nella sua versione americana. Ai tempi avevo da poco mollato un lavoro da sales manager e avevo iniziato a scribacchiare con un certo successo per portali e blog, così provai contattare Luna. Lui mi rispose per email, dicendomi di proporgli 5 idee per la rivista. Io gliene suggerii 50, tutte buone (a suo dire). Dopo un paio di settimane ero nella squadra che avrebbe dovuto realizzare il numero zero (ovvero quel numero di prova che viene poi sottoposto a focus group, cioè potenziali lettori, per capire se la rivista può avere un senso oppure no). La paga era risibile (363 euro netti al mese che, divisi per le ore lavorate, circa settanta alla settimana, fanno un tozzo di pane secco e un po’ acqua all’ora), ma sticazzi, pensavo: questa rivista è fica, innovativa, etc.etc. se lavoro bene mi assumeranno. Il team redazionale era formato dal sottoscritto, da un altro giornalista “senza pedigree”, Stefano Lentati, e da Alberto Grandi, bravissima persona, ottimo giornalista e figlio dell’amministratore delegato di Condè Nast. Lavoriamo tanto e bene, coordinati da Roberto Casalini e Paolo Bonanni, ex direttore di Max e GQ, presente come “chioccia” redazionale, visto che Luna è spesso (molto spesso) in giro... Dopo sei mesi, durante i quali scriviamo e/o traduciamo materiale sufficiente per almeno tre numeri, partoriamo il numero zero e ai focus group questo non va bene. Va benissimo. Se la rivista va in edicola è in larga parte merito nostro. Punto. Tutti contenti, caviale &amp; champagne? Macchè. Io e Stefano, in quanto “senza pedigree” veniamo convocati in una afosa mattina di agosto e de facto sbattuti in mezzo ad una strada perchè considerati “inesperti” da Luna, il quale peraltro veniva da un’esperienza trascorsa presso un quotidiano sportivo, Il Romanista, da lui diretto e fondato anni prima (espertissimo lui, come no). La domanda “ma se andavo bene per il numero zero, che peraltro grazie al mio lavoro è riuscito alla grande, com’è possibile che non vada bene per il numero uno?” resta senza risposta. La domanda “ma come ha fatto un giornalista che ha trattato sempre l’argomento “sport e Roma” ad andare a dirigere una rivista che è fondato su presupposti e tematiche antitetiche?” pure, resta senza risposta. Al nostro posto vengono presi giornalisti che ovviamente non avrebbero mai accettato le condizioni economiche proposte dal nostro contratto, da un periodico musicale, un maschile e un mensile tecnologico, la rivista arriva in edicola e poi va come va.

Of course the key word here is ""should"", but since corruption is a thing this is not always the case.

Now your analogy does not exactly work in this case, seeing as government representatives are special cases. I do understand what you mean though. And I am bad with analogies so I could not come up with one myself (sorry).

Nevertheless I am sorry but they are not responsible enough to take decisions as a group. Do you honestly think that they will go vote thinking of what could be best for Greece? How could they when they're ignorant of the full ramifications of each decision?

The main argument against direct democracy is the protection of the minorities. And I am sorry but this is a fact.

I feel that I need to clear something up though. I never claimed to be for or against either decision, I am just saying that direct democracy application is a bad idea.

Wanna edit to clarify the last bit: general consensus would indicate that Serbians don't like Americans as much as Croatians might.

You seem to believe Tsipras and I'm curious, how do you imagine this would work?

Over the next few days, watch one after the other of the EZ leaders make it abundantly clear what a ""no"" really means, just in case somebody actually believes a ""no"" could mean anything else but a Grexit. The default option if nothing is agreed will be just that -- a default. No deal means no extension means the ECB loses the legal basis for the Emergency Liquidity Assistance for the Greek banking system. No liquidity in form of euros means the Greek government will have to print its own money to keep the banks from collapsing, and they can't do that as long as they're in the Eurozone. If the banks collapse, no payments can be processed and no salaries can be payed, which is the one scenario that would be even worse than a return to the drachma, so Grexit it would be.

There is no way that Tsipras is stupid eneugh to believe he can renegotiate after a ""no"".

Facts:

* First of all, an intentional ""plan"" to decimate Ukraine's population doesn't make sense for these two reasons: 

1) During that specific time period, many parts of Ukraine's territory had a huge number of ethnic Russians, ESPECIALLY in large cities. If we take the general narrative that ""the Soviet high command wanted to affirm the leading role of Russians in the USSR"", then why would it purposely seek genocide in a territory that has such a huge number of Russians?

2) During the 20s, the USSR actually pursued a policy of affirming its individual republics' ""roots"". This included the popularization of indigenous languages as well as letting indigenous leaders occupy high ranks of the power structure. To be objective, this policy was later discontinued, but only AFTER the famine.

I just think it's an  anti-democratic view. 

*I* said *I* liked  this annoucement, and to sum  up why I said ""because it's democratic"". Which doesn't mean that people who express nuanced arguments such as for example  ""one week may be a bit short"", or ""on such serious issues people need to be able to find all relevant informations in order to form a opinion"" are anti-democratic. I didn't mean ""I like the idea, I think it's democratic: if you don't like the idea, then it means you're anti-democratic"". 

(I feel like it would a bit like me saying that since you believe I have a binary logic, you believe people who make a choice between two options have a binary logic, instead of a formed opinion. ""Do you accept the Troïka deal?"", ""Do you want Sarkozy or Hollande for president?"" No matter how you answer, since you gladly agreed the opportunity to give an answer, it's binary and limited. (Well yes, for instance I found the Sarkozy/Hollande choice not ideal, far from perfect,  but I chose to vote anyway. It's still better than accepting what a bunch of non elected people would have decided.) 

When we were asked about the european constitution in 2005 and we said no, was it because it was too complex for us to understand? Are the TTIP negociations kept so secret because it's too complex for the average Joe and will we have to accept it without being able to vote on it once the content is revealed? What is an easy enough question to ask people then? Choosing a President is complex too. Where do we start and where do we stop with such a mentality? I think it's a dangerous argument. OF COURSE people need to be able to know the details in order to make a decision, I agree with that part of your argumentation, what I disagree with is the idea that in itself a referendum is not good, and that people are too stupid to give an opinion on some complicated issues.

Such a complex matter and we know nothing or too little. Let's not carry on with arbitrary generalizations.

Last but not least, it is not a conspiracy. It is as blatant as it gets. For every measure institutions rejected, Syriza proposed an anti measure with similar results. They even declined the proposal of a special taxation of 12%, for every company that had more that 500.000€ profits. For the first time in our recent history we tried to tax capital and profits, and their answer was ""Keep you hands off profits but cut lowest pensions"". Completely unreasonable.

No. People would vote for them and extremely close to the specified percentage because the sample size is sufficient.

You think [these people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbpyk1uHNWY) going nuts are faking outrage? And those are not even jihadists, nor the most radical of muslims for all we know.   

This doesn't mean all Islam is the same, much like not all Christianity is the same. The Christianity in Sudan and that in Portugal are very different, as are that in Portugal today and that in Portugal 400 years ago. Some versions are not very problematic, some others are a cancer in society. 

Yes, extreme versions of Islam exist, are spreading and are a problem.

&gt; and alone, what can they do? they have nothing.

And that's still not reason enough to hang out on a express highway. It would probably be smarter to organize each other and coordonate with some NGO to help elevate their living standards and not just act like a gang. Just an idea.

Wherever they want that isn't dangerous to somebody else (like a highway) ? Just like for the local frenchs.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_withdrawal_from_the_eurozone#Legality

&gt;    A working paper published by the European Central Bank concluded

&gt; &gt;   … that negotiated withdrawal from the EU would not be legally impossible even prior to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, and that unilateral withdrawal would undoubtedly be legally controversial; that, while permissible, a recently enacted exit clause is, prima facie, not in harmony with the rationale of the European unification project and is otherwise problematic, mainly from a legal perspective; that a Member State's exit from EMU, without a parallel withdrawal from the EU, would be legally inconceivable; and that, while perhaps feasible through indirect means, a Member State's expulsion from the EU or EMU, would be legally next to impossible.

&gt;    In the legal literature, the question of whether a country can unilaterally leave the Eurozone without leaving the EU is controversial. Jens Dammann has taken the view that under certain conditions, it is possible for a Member State to end its membership in the Eurozone without leaving the European Union.

No-one is willing to invest while they are shackled to the euro. That's because Greece is in outright deflation.

Deflation wrecks investment. Say for example you buy a business and plants and machinery for $1million.  Two months later, because of deflation, you can't sell at your preferred price or even at a break-even price, you have to sell your products at a 15% discount - which means you are making a loss. While Greece is in the euro, the deflation will continue and you continue making losses.

The key point is that in all businesses you have to buy your raw materials before you make your finished goods, and if prices fall between the two points in time you make a loss.

Merkel is a complete bird-brain if she doesn't understand this. More likely she does understand but thinks Greeks (and their investors) are worth sacrificing for the sake of German banks.

Well they're White and White is Right! Let's just go criticize those uncivilized Chinese for eating these animals!


Same with Whale Hunting. Why are most if not all of the attacks on the Japanese? [Norway and Iceland] (http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/our-work/whales/which-countries-are-still-whaling) both hunt whales. But that's OK, because they're White!



Hindus revere cows and dictate that they should never be killed but I've never heard an Indian attack a society for consuming beef.

But the eurozone could have insisted with force that the fiscal system should be revamped to make the rich pay more taxes, remove some of the absurd exemptions and make the poor and middle class pay less to allow them to buy things and contribute to the economy. They could have insisted that companies profit be taxed at a higher rate. They could have insisted that fiscal exile should be fiercely fought against. They could have argued that employment in the public sector should not be drastically reduced because it constituted a reliable consumer base. They could have asked Greece to massively reduce it's military spending. They could have financed unemployment for a while to make sure the population did not fall into misery. They could have requested that the water and energy sector be regulated or even nationalized to ensure that the prices were not subjected to speculation. They could have loaned money to Greece for free instead of the 6, 9, 12% the banks asked. They could asked that the banks be nationalized or socialized given that they had completely failed their purpose. They could have given back to Greece the interest on the Greek debt they possessed instead of keeping it for themselves. They could have asked to put in place policies that favored long term external investment to focus on growth and stability. They could have done tons of things different, the first of all being buying the entirety of the insignificant Greek debt at the start of it all.

But they didn't. Not because they didn't think about it. Not because what they did was ""the best we all managed at the time"". That's bullshit. They knew they could have make other choices, asked Greece other things for the bailout money, but they didn't, because everything I just suggested does not fit their ideology. It's the opposite. And they know it.

Instead they asked that the wages and pension and unemployment benefit be reduced, that the taxes on the poor and middle class be raised and that the public sector employment be slashed, thereby sabotaging both consumption and fiscal income. They asked that hospitals be closed, suppressing access to health in a time of misery where people needed it most. They continued to sell expensive weapons and military equipment to Greece well above its realistic needs. They refused to cooperate when asked to give the names of Greek's fiscally exiled citizen. They insisted on privatizing plenty of public company for a fraction of their real value. They requested that part of their territory be sold to foreign investor for speculative purpose. They agreed to buy directly Greek debt even though it was forbidden only when it became a last resort to stop the collapse. I could probably go on and on and on if I wasn't doing this on the top of my head.

And again, they know exactly what they were doing. And the consequences. It was not mistakes, nor ""the best they managed"". It was planned and deliberate and they could have stopped the moment they realized the horrible impact on the population but they didn't because in their twisted reality all that suffering should have led to growth. And when they don't see that growth, instead of wondering what they did wrong and making different choices, they double down. Because they don't know what kind of other politic to do. They know what I suggested exists but its madness to them.

So don't tell me or anyone that you sympathize and that ""It sucks"". No, it doesn't ""sucks"". It's not a football game with bad referee decisions. It's politics.

- The city itself is pretty flat but just outside of it (like a mile or two) there are some beautiful hills from which you can admire the city. I also herd that you can catch a similar panorama from from the roof of the new auditorium, which is an elevated public square. 
- Use a bike if you can, Florence is small (a bike will get you everywhere in no time) and flat and you'll probably find something good and cheap if you ask people around (buy a locker!)
- The MUST see for the week-end tourist are the Basilica of Santa Maria novella and the Uffizzi ""the most beautiful museum in the world"" (tell them you are a student, you'll pay less for the entry) but i'm sure you won't miss them. There is much more to see but you'll do well just using some tourist guide.
- Ask the locals for a place where to eat a good ""Fiorentina"", it's a super tasty 1-2 lbs thick steak. Not very cheap (30€ to 50€) but you can't leave Florence without eating one.

Can't be very specific since i always lived in Rome and visited Florence like 2 or 3 times so those are just my 2 cents.

- I go to a job interview.  

- Manager explains to me that their core system has **10 major problems** which causes the company to bleed money and it needs **at the very least to get into semi working condition**.

- Manager gives me all the details. Technical/financial/political/red tape/cultural difficulties.

- Manager is convinced that I have the technical skills but he wants to know if I can do what is needed to be done. He flat out asks me, ""Can you fix this system?""

- With conviction and exuberant confidence I tell him ""Not only I can fix it but I can make it better!""

- I am hired and I am told  I have full reign to get this done. Full control and full support to steer this situation.

- Six months pass and the manager requests for a progress report.

- I inform him that not only I did **not**  fix the 10 major problems he wanted me to fix but I made those problems even worse and I created 10 more problems.

- Manager asks me ""OK we all knew it would be tough but do you have a plan to address this?""

- I reply to him ""Yes I do have a plan, and my plan is to ask you what you want me to do. I am asking you to take the final  decision on what should done"".

Ich kenne die Berliner Situation aus jahrelanger eigener Erfahrung und die Stadt ist im Gegensatz zu anderen deutschen Großräumen im ÖPNV defakto immer noch eine Insel. Das das zu massiv günstigeren Preisen führt ist logisch.

Wer zusätzlich Autofahren und dafür ein Mehrfaches an Kosten tragen möchte kann dies gerne tun.

&gt; Eine lediglich moderate Nachfrageerhöhung bei einer faktischen Preisreduzierung auf Null ist ziemlich optimistisch.

Eine solche Nachfrageerhöhung im ÖPNV wäre eines der zentralen Ziele einer solchen Reform. Die volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten des Individualverkehrs sind höher als diejenigen die dem einzelnem Autofahrer entstehen. In Ballungsräumen stellt der IV eines der zentralen Probleme dar.

Aber keine Angst, es gibt auch in Ballungsräumen genügend Autofahrer die ihr Auto *ganz dringend* als Statussymbol brauchen und auch die Automobilindustrie wird diese Idee garantiert sehr effektiv sabotieren.

The Boston Marathon bombings severely injured over 220 people directly - people had their legs and feet blown off and dozens had life-threatening blood loss, trauma, concussions, and internal bleeding. **After the first few seconds, every single person made it into a Boston hospital and survived.**

&gt;The explosions took place at 2:50 P.M., twelve seconds apart. Medical personnel manning the runners’ first-aid tent swiftly converted it into a mass-casualty triage unit. Emergency medical teams mobilized en masse from around the city, resuscitated the injured, and somehow dispersed them to eight different hospitals in minutes, despite chaos and snarled traffic.

&gt; My hospital, the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, received thirty-one victims, twenty-eight of them with significant injuries. Seven arrived nearly at once, starting at 3:08 P.M. All required emergency surgery. The first to go to surgery—a patient in shock, hemorrhaging profusely, with inadequate breathing and a near-completely severed leg—was resuscitated and on an operating table by 3:25 P.M., just thirty-five minutes after the blast. The rest followed, one after the other, spaced by just minutes. Twelve patients in all would undergo surgery—mostly vascular and orthopedic procedures—before the evening was done.

&gt; This kind of orchestration happened all across the city. Massachusetts General Hospital also received thirty-one victims—at least four of whom required amputations. Boston Medical Center received twenty-three victims. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center handled twenty-one. Boston Children’s Hospital took in ten children, ages two to twelve. Tufts Medical Center and St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center each treated eighteen victims. One emergency physician told me he’d never heard so many ambulance sirens before in his life.

I wouldn't necessarily be against a quota system of sorts if it comes down to it, but there's a lot the EU can do to make the number of migrants more sustainable.

For one thing, the EU needs to get it's house in order. In the state the european economy is in right now, with 10 percent unemployment, it's really not well prepared to accept immigrants, especially given that many of those immigrants first arrive in southern european economies which are the worst off. This highlights two problems. First, the lack of fiscal transfer mechanisms in place within europe, which means the Euro inherently advantages some economies over others. Second, the lack of willingness by many EU countries to take on new immigrants — even when may of those countries are better prepared to shoulder the burden than those currently reeling under the pressure. 

Europe certainly has the capacity to take in more migrants if we're just looking at current population and land area, the issue is the economy currently isn't healthy enough to really do anything for these people. It is worth mentioning though that population growth does necessarily spur output growth, even if it also can cause slight decreases in GDP per capita in some cases due to diminishing marginal utility. That wouldn't be an issue so much if the economy had the capacity to take in these new people better, and in fact population growth coupled with increases in per capita output can have a huge effect on growth. 

Secondly, there's a lot the EU could be doing in Africa and, to some extent, the middle east to improve conditions there, and improve cooperation with the local governments which would lessen the immigration difficulties considerably. I'm not talking about military interventionism necessarily, either — reforming the Common Agricultural Policy would be huge, for instance. But it's worth mentioning that when European nations do decide to take an interventionist attitude, they need to stick actually commit to ding it right; Libya was as much a French/British initiative as it was an American one, but all three nations basically abandoned the nation to it's devices afterwards, and that's played a part in both the migrant crisis we're seeing now, as well as spreading islamic extremism, which is an issue a lot of people, both rightly and wrongly, connect with immigration.

At this video he can be heard to be saying to the hostess that Tsipras is going to take Greece out of the Eurozone with a Referendum.


That guy is a legend and has a cult in Greece. He is like the modern Cassandra. He have been warning Greeks of incoming economic collapse, default, harsh austerity, riots, and what not since the early 90s, and nobody believed him. He had been considered a nutcase and was ridiculed by the mainstream media.


Until recently, when everything he had been warning Greeks for, for decades, started becoming true. There is even a video of him in Youtube, in which someone cutted and edited old footage of his warnings, and placed it side by side with later TV footage, showing how his predictions started becoming a reality, titled ""Vasilis Leventis - the Prophecies 1992 - 2013"".

The narrative is that ""classical"" conservatives would oppose things like foreign wars, big government programs (especially ""evil"" ones - NSA spying, bloated DHS), corporate cronyism and out-of-control defense spending, etc.

Personally I'm not convinced that the classical conservative ever existed. I think it's kind of a rosy view of history, and the classical conservative is a mythical beast that never did any wrong. In any case, neo-cons represent a markedly hawkish trend in American Conservatism and world affairs, exemplified by the post 9/11 Bush administration.

**Edit:** Wikipedia does a better job than I do.

&gt; For example, Stefan Halper and Jonathan Clarke (a libertarian based at Cato), in their 2004 book on neoconservatism, America Alone: The Neo-Conservatives and the Global Order,[93] characterized the neoconservatives, at that time, as uniting around three common themes:

&gt; 1. A belief deriving from religious conviction that the human condition is defined as a choice between good and evil and that the true measure of political character is to be found in the willingness by the former (themselves) to confront the latter.
&gt; 2. An assertion that the fundamental determinant of the relationship between states rests on military power and the willingness to use it.
&gt; 3. A primary focus on the Middle East and global Islam as the principal theater for American overseas interests.

&gt; In putting these themes into practice, neo-conservatives:

&gt; 1. Analyze international issues in black-and-white, absolute moral categories. They are fortified by a conviction that they alone hold the moral high ground and argue that disagreement is tantamount to defeatism.
&gt;2. Focus on the ""unipolar"" power of the United States, seeing the use of military force as the first, not the last, option of foreign policy. They repudiate the ""lessons of Vietnam,"" which they interpret as undermining American will toward the use of force, and embrace the ""lessons of Munich,"" interpreted as establishing the virtues of preemptive military action.
&gt; 3. Disdain conventional diplomatic agencies such as the State Department and conventional country-specific, realist, and pragmatic, analysis. They are hostile toward nonmilitary multilateral institutions and instinctively antagonistic toward international treaties and agreements. ""Global unilateralism"" is their watchword. They are fortified by international criticism, believing that it confirms American virtue.
&gt;4. Look to the Reagan administration as the exemplar of all these virtues and seek to establish their version of Reagan's legacy as the Republican and national orthodoxy.[93]:10–11",null,0,null,1435387712,null,0,1435388361,0,cskawyg,null,t3_3b8mqw,null,t1_cskawyg,null,t1_csjzjlf,null,null,null,1437387293,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

If you're worried about GSM people and adoption in Germany, how about the fact that we still legally consider sexual identity disorder to be a thing - and that mentally ill (i.e. also all openly trans*) people can not adopt. More on that later.

The blood donation ban is ridiculous indeed. It belongs to a whole host of idiotic restrictions (amongst others aimed at people who come from countries with Malaria - who just so happen to be black or brown - originally, even if they've been IN Germany for several decades). I really hope the European courts will fix this one ASAP. All of it.

However, there are a ton of things Germany can be proud of in recent years regarding GSM rights. Here are some:
GSM are protected classes in employment law, and in most provision of goods and services situations.

Insurances have to pay for the transition treatments including hormones and SRS for trans* people (probably the most vulnerable GSM group). Because Germany has good insurance coverage in general, that means the vast majority of German citizens who are trans* have access to transition.

SRS is not required to change the legal sex. Living in the target gender pre-transition is not required to receive hormone treatment. (Go go BVG!) The TSG was a stain on our nation for a very long time, and the courts effectivel gutted it according to new scientific and medical insight. Waiting for the rest to go away now.

Just the change of the first name is enough to get all documentation re-issued, and prospective trans* employees need not include their legal sex if it differs from the one implied by their first name. That is to say - fully transitioning without changing the legal sex is possible.

Of course, there are also things that are genuinely awful:

The X on the birth certificate. The phrasing both in instructions to administration and the letter of the law both don't do what any law regarding intersex children should do - prevent cosmetic 'corrective' surgery or hormone treatment without informed consent of the patient. The problem here is not that it is a temporary measure, but how it is established how that X should be placed.

Much as with trans people, it seems sensible to create a program whereby the spot remains empty, and children choose their own gender when science says most of them are ready to do so (I'm guessing just pre-puberty, given enough education about the possibilities).

Being trans* is still considered a mental illness by lawmakers (and many medical professionals...) in Germany, as mentioned above. Although the prescribed treatment in Germany *is* hormones and SRS - which is good - it's very strange to consider it a mental illness. Yes, it causes the individuals a  severe degree of suffering - but that suffering is not rooted in the mind, as evidenced by the fact that the only successful treatment we've found modifies the body.

In short: Yeah, Germany is ""behind"" on some things - but we are also ahead of the curve in some matters that are way more pressing than whether we want the words ""civil union"" or ""marriage"" on our stable gay and lesbian economic unions.",null,0,null,1435388251,null,0,false,0,cskb2mj,null,t3_3b8nsj,null,t1_cskb2mj,null,t1_csjygov,null,null,null,1437387382,null,11,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,11,null

Agreed. The intention could be that Syriza wants the people do decide, but it could just as well be about Syriza wanting to avoid blame.

I don't have a problem with reducing the malaria risk, really. (Paper-white Europeans who travel to malaria-risk countries are also covered by the ban, and America does the same.) The the fact that Germany allows donations from foreigners at all is still better than what the American guidelines allow. It puts me in this weird situation where I can donate indefinitely in Germany, but in two more years I'll hit the 5-years-abroad mark and will be banned from donating ever again in the US. 

&gt; Insurances have to pay for the transition treatments including hormones and SRS for trans* people.

Obamacare has also opened the door to this in the US. There were also some private insurers that offered this prior to the reforms.

&gt; SRS is not required to change the legal sex.

The States are a patchwork on this, and I believe the system will eventually unify in our favor just like it did yesterday.

&gt;Living in the target gender pre-transition is not required to receive hormone treatment.

The old ""lived experience"" nonsense has been largely removed from the [international Standards of Care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-life_experience_\(transgender\)), so everyone wins there.

&gt;Being trans* is still considered a mental illness[...]

1. Hat die gegenwärtige Preisstruktur in München nichts mit dem Vorher-Nacher-Vergleich in Berlin zu tun

2. Sind bei deiner Fahrkarte mit 16 Ringen für 210€ Städte weit, weit außerhalb Münchens dabei (Bad Tölz in Ring 14!). Eine Monatskarte für die gesamte Stadt München  (4 Ringe) im Jahresabo (12 Monate zum Preis von 9,5 Monaten) kostet umgerechnet **58,58€**

&gt;Wer zusätzlich Autofahren und dafür ein Mehrfaches an Kosten tragen möchte kann dies gerne tun.

Oder man fährt Fahrrad. Oder man geht zu Fuß. Oder man arbeitet von zuhause. Oder man arbeitet nicht und braucht auch kein ganztägiges Ticket für Gesamtberlin. Oder man braucht nur ein Ticket für Berlin AB, was im Abo pro Monat schon jetzt 58,92€ kostet, bzw. 43,17€ ab 10 Uhr

&gt; Eine solche Nachfrageerhöhung im ÖPNV wäre eines der zentralen Ziele einer solchen Reform. Die volkswirtschaftlichen Kosten des Individualverkehrs sind höher als diejenigen die dem einzelnem Autofahrer entstehen.

Das Ziel ist also eine große Nachfrageerhöhung, aber für die Kosten setzt man nur eine moderate Nachfrageerhöhung an. Merkste selber, ne?

&gt; Aber keine Angst, es gibt auch in Ballungsräumen genügend Autofahrer die ihr Auto ganz dringend als Statussymbol brauchen und auch die Automobilindustrie wird diese Idee garantiert sehr effektiv sabotieren.

This drama is dragging on now for 5 years, is it really true that the population in greece in all that time didn't even try to understand the basics what's going on? 

Quite frankly, macroeconomics has several models, but none which could predict with a significant certainty what's going to happen if Greece does exit the Euro. So in the end it boils down to a lot of psychology, as there is simply not enough knowledge available to make a rational decision.

Personally I think the Greeks should vote for the decision they are more comfortable with. Both decisions will cost them some of their living standards, no question there will be dire years ahead. But I'm convinced the economy will pick up faster if the population at least have the impression they can better their situtation, if they have a real motivation to do so.

Nonostante tutti i difetti della lega ero convinto che fosse l'unico movimento che avesse delle idee concrete, ovvero il federalismo. Mentre gli altri movimenti erano solo delle molli vesciche attaccate alle palle degli italiani, buoni a farsi solo i cazzi loro.

Me either - my grandma almost died of it, and that is not a good way to go. Post-travel restrictions, I'm absolutely in favour of. They're scientifically sound, after all. But this also affects people who haven't *been* in a high risk malaria area for several decades, and who haven't ever had malaria - as long as they were born there.

&gt; This is what kills me.

Yeah, more and more medical professionals understand how to treat trans* medical issues in Germany as well. We had a very early move for pre-puberty treatment which resulted in a huge outcry of concerned citizen (but trans* kids were getting care at least). Others are set in the way of the days of their education, and of course our government is years behind the science as per usual. 

The recent improvements were all handed down by courts, not by the legislative. It was done so quietly that my close non-transitioned friend didn't even know she had options not involving SRS now - she found out two years after the fact, when we were talking about how anything concerning GSM rights that comes out of our government is generally ill informed because of the whole intersex law fiasco.

I really wish, considering that we have seen time and time again that medical science evolves (I see this both as a queer woman and as an autistic), that we could somehow tie our laws, regulations and best practice recommendations to scientific development - for example by putting an expiry date on them. Say a law has to be scientifically re-evaluated one year after it came into effect - if it passes muster at that point, it has to be checked again three years after it came into effect, then seven etc.

You should go at least once to see fiorentina soccer game play, just to have an idea what the ritual of soccer conveys here : emotions, feelings, idea of community and so forth. Also you should go to visit the literature department and try to mingle with other students, Italian. I know that is scary to go like a lunatic and ask to talk with Italian students that, like every other students in the world, they have an attitude, but they are also really curious and if you you are authentic and real you will find someone, trust me. Be bald and sincere and good things will follow. Obviously Italian women are beautiful, probably the most beautiful in the world. Probably they aren't the most beautiful but the most attractive, definitely. Their wild often pure charme is impossible to find elsewhere, they are warm and mysterious, full of shyness but also tremendously wholehearted, maternal and teenager-like. They often behave like princess, they are snob but if you smile enough and you are not stupid you can date a girl, buy her flowers or invite her out. Since you are faraway from home you can break the patterns and be original and romantic and you will have success. Just talk of stuff that is vital and important for you: women find this very erotic.  
Try to go at theatre, the opera, at least once. We did not have the novel in 19th century like France and England and Russia did, our golden century was with opera and tells us a lot the way we are about feeling and melodrama, how ""uterine"" we are toward emotions. 
Be suspicious of the Renaissance's propaganda, most Americans come here to visit this Disneyworld alike park whose theme is Renaissance. It is all bullshit, history, past, gone, that spirit is gone or it undergone  a profound transformation and when  Florentines talk about Renaissance they are kitsch, glued to a past that is stuffy, like to live inside a museum.  Better check who Adriano Olivetti was: he is the real Renaissance man of the 20th century. Arduino is the future, in fact was created in Ivrea the Piemonte town of Adriano Olivetti. Check h-farm and our idea of future: we are quite original, it can be an inspiring experience to know about how we deal with with that stuff.
Also if I was you I'd check the new agricultural dimension: wine, for example, and how things have changed in the last 20 years. 
Like this you will have the so longed cultural shock. 
Most Americans come here to see their phoney idea about Italy confirmed, they say they want to visit Italy but what they really want is to stay away from reality, and Florence there's plenty of opportunities to find people who will tell you the fable of Renaissance.
I could come to Texas with the idea of meeting nothing but rednecks and be puzzled to find out that tom ford, the guy who made Gucci great again, is from Texas.

Greece was militarily defeated and had little leverage or ability to tell their creditors to take a hike, since those same creditors were the only thing between them and the Ottomans.

In addition, their debts were denominated in foreign currencies backed by gold (francs and pounds). Gold is hard to print.

Germany can't simply militarily occupy Greece and demand repayment like they did in 1897. This time around Greece has total latitude to tell them to get fucked or to pay them entirely in drachmas, if they so please.

Imo there are no good solutions to your problem, there are bad and worse solutions.

Your public expenditure and debt was already way too high at the start of the crisis. Granting loans to somebody whose expenses are unsustainable doesn't make a lot of sense except if you expect them too change. Lowering your government personnel for example would have been something you would have to do anyway. It's a shame you have to do it during a crises, but say the Troika were very lenient and said you can cut expenses after your economy has normalized, there wouldn't be an incentive to do so for your politicians.

But having this discussion about the religion should not mean that we should talk about the people as a whole, as if *they* are incompatible with western values.

Molte persone del Sud non riescono a trovare lavoro nella città o nella provincia nella quale sono nate e cresciute ed emigrano al Nord o all'estero per lavorare. Contemporaneamente vedono che nei campi ed in generale, nei lavori che non richiedono particolari abilità, ci sono parecchie persone che lavorano in nero e spesso in condizioni disumane. Molti immigrati clandestini al sud vivono in schiavitù e se muoiono vengono seppelliti di nascosto, perché ufficialmente non esistono.

Il problema di tutta questa situazione che ti ho spiegato è che lo stato si gira dall'altra parte. Quindi, alcune persone, pensano che una soluzione potrebbe essere quella di fermare l'immigrazione.

No means that Greece will probably default, leave the euro, maybe leave the EU and get a new currency that will be worthless. The Greek government might not cut pensions because they can print money, but the money will devalue so much that the effect will be the same as if they cut pensions. Also Greece will not have much international support or good will, except maybe from Russia or China who seek to exploit the situation, but who knows what kind of support even they are willing to give and what the conditions will be.

TL;DR So basically Yes means the economy will be bad for some time to come, but at least you know roughly what to expect.

L'INSEE et la DARES listent pas mal de catégories de personnes, qui se recoupent parfois et qui permettent de dessiner un peu ce qui se passe. 

Si on part des plus chômeurs pour arriver aux moins chômeurs on a, dans l'ordre:

- étrangers non UE (cad personnes non-françaises habitant en France)

- immigrés (personnes nées à l'étranger, vivant en France, de nationalité française ou non) 

- descendants d'immigrés

- français non immigrés (comprenant donc les descendants d'immigrés ayant la nationalité depuis la naissance)

- étrangers UE


Alors la constatation qu'on peut faire, c'est que plus tu as un statut proche du Français né en France, plus tu as des chances de ne pas être au chômage. Si tu es immigré, tu as 2 fois plus de chances d'être au chômage (et franchement, la bureaucratie explique beaucoup) et ça tombe à 1.5 pour les descendants d'immigrés qui peuvent souffrir de racisme et de pauvreté mais qui ont le sésame de la nationalité.

Plus rigolo: les Français sont en fait de gros glandeurs quand on les compare aux étrangers venant de l'UE. Ceci dit, sur ce dernier point, l'honnêteté oblige de reconnaître que cette population vient principalement en France pour travailler: hé! C'est quand même étonnant: quand on autorise les étrangers à venir chercher du travail en France, il y a moins de chômage que si on leur demande d'avoir un autre motif pour rentrer!

Do you think that islam has anything to do at all with the Hebdo ""inciden""t? Here is what i think about it, in the Qu'ran it says that you are forbidden to depict muhammed. It also says that you can do whatever you want to non muslims (more or less) i think those two things combined led the muslims to do what they did.

Its possible they are uninformed what the Qu'ran actually says, since it says that muhammed is not supposed to be depicted as to deify him. This does not say that you should kill people for depicting muhammed, but so many muslims gets so fucking offended when people do.

On a slightly deeper level, there's a whole world of things to discover in Spain if you can get over being a picky eater. I did and I'm very happy for it.

What a defaulting nation can try is negotiating about restructuring it's debts. If this is successfull is completely dictated by the lender, and most likely the creditor has to offer at least some collateral to succeed.

**Poporoya Alimentari** - Via Bartolomeo Eustachi 17 - http://4sq.com/zq4NHP

È un piccolo negozio di alimentari jappo con una zona adibita a chiostro in cui il proprietario (Shiro) prepara i suoi manicaretti per la clientela. Non è un ristorante in cui prendersela comoda e chiacchierare: entri, ordini alla cassa, ti siedi, mangi, paghi, esci. È molto conosciuto a Milano, quindi aspettati code, ma il suo chirashi è il migliore che abbia mai mangiato. Te la cavi con 20€ (dipende da cosa ordini), nessuna differenza tra pranzo e cena. Non si può prenotare.


**Yoji** - Via Timavo, 78 - http://4sq.com/ak9dHo

Ex allievo di Shiro, ora ha un ristorante tutto suo e riesce quasi ad eguagliare il maestro. Sperimenta abbastanza con i suoi piatti, quindi alcune proposte non le trovi da altre parti; i suoi roll sono fenomenali. È abbastanza caro, a cena, ma con 30€ mangi in modo decoroso.

Ai seguenti ristoranti non sono mai andato di sera, ma nonostante il menù prandiale sia limitato, sono comunque rimasto soddisfatto. Tieni presente che per cena potrebbero aumentare i prezzi.

**Fukurou** - Via Trivulzio, 16 - http://4sq.com/1f10GyQ

Sono tutti Giapponesi: cuochi, camerieri e la maggior parte dei clienti; è surreale. Non hanno sushi nel menù (almeno a pranzo), ma se chiedi te lo fanno senza problemi. Tutto ciò che ho provato mi ha soddisfatto e non ho mai pagato più di 20€ (compresa acqua, coperto e caffè/dolce), nonostante non abbiano promozioni specifiche per il pranzo. È quasi obbligatoria la prenotazione perché non hanno molti posti.

**Nozomi** - Via Pietro Calvi 2 - http://4sq.com/ubHJew

Specializzato in ramen, non serve sushi. Perfetto per un pranzo completo e soddisfacente (qualità + quantità) a 12-15 Euro.

**J's Hiro** - Via Carlo Vittadini 7 - http://4sq.com/9bmv3j

Ordina il piatto del giorno, o fatti consigliare dalla proprietaria: difficilmente rimarrai deluso. Peccato che la zona in cui si trova il locale non sia granché.

**Zazà Ramen** - Via Solferino 48 - http://4sq.com/1fVJQ4B

È gestito da Italiani, ma ti assicuro che fanno il miglior ramen che abbia mai provato; ci sono spesso dei Giapponesi tra i clienti. Entro i 20-25 Euro te la dovresti cavare sia a pranzo che a cena. Gradita la prenotazione.

**Sumire** - Via Varese 1 - http://4sq.com/bxLPjD

Io te lo butto qua, nel caso tu voglia provare qualcosa di molto peculiare: qualità eccelsa e buona varietà, ma porzioni scarse per i miei gusti; spendi almeno 30€ e quando finisci hai ancora fame. Obbligatorio prenotare, fanno turnazioni di clientela.


Ce ne sono anche altri, ma al momento quello che mi sento di consigliare sono questi.

First of all, there's a big question if a referendum can be organised in such short time. You need to prepare voting centres, train people, put the infrastructure in place and even then anyone will be able to question the validity of the outcome of the referendum. The only other people who can organise a referendum on such short notice are Russians, so maybe it's worth asking them for tips.

Secondly, the vote, regardless of the outcome, will have no meaning - the deadline of IMF payment will be missed and bailout program will have expired. Extension of a bailout was turned down by the Greeks and even if the Greeks wanted the extension now, it would have to be approved by several national parliaments, so again, no time and always a chance that the program would not be extended due to a hold up in a single parliament.

Lastly, if it was all about democracy and giving people a choice, why was the referendum not organised earlier? The talks have been stalling for half a year, but the Greek government decides to hold it only now after it is too late?

Last month 3 terrorist attacks took place on the 29th, the only difference here is that a lot of people got killed this month. So they used more explosives or whatever method they used to go about it this time, so you could refer to the rise of more powerful method to carry out their terrorist attacks but you are not.

If we go back to January we had 7 terrorist attacks in 2 days time, the 4th and the 5th (4 and 3)

Since most groups carrying out these terror attacks are not connected to each other we have to look at the number of actual terror attacks and not the results of those terror attacks. So no the frequence of terror attacks stays pretty steady. Its just that these terror attacks killed a lot of people.

null,false,OffendedLiverSausage,GERM,Germany,null,"&gt; Researchers claimed that the percent of supporters of same-sex marriage in Russia fell from 14 to just 5 percent over the past three years.

It is quite possible that the poll does not measure what people believe, but rather what people think they are allowed to believe. I somehow doubt that many Russians feel free to express their support in the current climate of institutionalized anti-gay sentiment. 

In the end, what we currently see in Russia is a topic being instrumentalized to overcome other social tensions. It is an old, but also effective, strategy to stigmatize certain social groups so that the growing discontent of the population is channeled as hate towards that group and not into political change. A strong historical example are the Yews in Nazi Germany. However, there are also many contemporary examples. The ""illegal immigrants"" in the US. The Sinti and Roma in many European Countries. Refugees are a also popular hate target in Europe right now. The gays in many devoutly christian or muslim areas. Women in many parts of the world. In some countries it is young people (for example in the UK, with growing resentment against youths).

In all these examples, the stigmatized population is never the root cause for the social problems. Structural imbalances or sometimes an outright [cleptocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Kleptocracy) disenfranchise large parts of the population. Economic pressure, often asymmetrically applied against households with lower income, adds to the frustration. Solutions, however, would be very complex and might cut into the profits of a select elite (e.g., the Russian oligarchs and/or Putin's regime).

Une baisse des dépenses de 3 Milliards, on va pas récupérer 3 Milliards, parce qu'on va mécaniquement réduire les gains de l'État (moins de TVA prélevée, moins de taxes sur l'essence, etc.) Tu risques même de faire un ""effet de levier"" à l'envers : si une boîte partiellement dépendante des commandes publiques coule, c'est aussi tout l'argent qu'elle aurait pu gagner des commandes privées que tu pourras pas taxer. Si un mec rendu précaire ne se soigne pas assez tôt et chope une maladie grave, ça va te coûter plus cher que si tu avais pas pinaillé pour rembourser sa boîte d'antibiotiques. Y a des maladies, si tu les soignes tout de suite, une semaine d'antibios et c'est torché : si t'attends une semaine de trop par contre, c'est opération sous anesthésie générale, parfois plusieurs. Sans parler des risques d'épidémie si tu laisses des maladies proliférer (c'est pour ça qu'aucun politicien censé ne touchera à l'AME en France - ça coûte de l'argent mais c'est notre bouclier contre les risques d'épidémies beaucoup plus coûteuses).

J'ajoute que désengager l'État de certains services ou missions est d'autant plus casse gueule dans un pays comme la Grèce qui n'a pas forcément vraiment un secteur privé prêt à prendre la relève.

Pour le reste, tu as pas tort sur le problème avec l'administration fiscale grecque, dire ""on va augmenter les impôts de 3 Milliards"" c'est limite un vœu pieu pour un gouvernement grec.

That's a neat idea, but unfortunately the Greek state is not able to collect taxes properly. Previous governments have promised to improve that situation and then haven not delivered. The creditors realised this and began demanding cuts where they cut happen instead. With the Greek state having a bloated public sector and high social spending, these were of course the number one targets instead. I'm not a fan of this, but the blame lies primarily on the Greek elites, not their creditors.

&gt; They could have insisted that companies profit be taxed at a higher rate.

I'm sure this idea came up, but ramping up taxes while there is no proper system to collect them is pointless.

&gt; They could have insisted that fiscal exile should be fiercely fought against.

You mean with stuff like the [Lagarde list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagarde_list) which are still to be investigated by the Greek authorities?

&gt; They could have argued that employment in the public sector should not be drastically reduced because it constituted a reliable consumer base.

Employment had to be reduced because the Greek state did no longer have the means to finance said public sector.

&gt; They could have asked Greece to massively reduce it's military spending.

I agree and I'm not sure why this hasn't happened until now, though that does contradict your wish to *not* slash the public sector.

&gt; They could have financed unemployment for a while to make sure the population did not fall into misery.

Such a programme seems to be under development, but it's unrealistic to expect it in an ad-hoc fashion.

&gt; They could have requested that the water and energy sector be regulated or even nationalized to ensure that the prices were not subjected to speculation.

Both sectors are all but nationalised. I'm not sure what speculation you are referring to.

&gt; They could have loaned money to Greece for free instead of the 6, 9, 12% the banks asked.

I agree the rates could have been lower. But don't suggest that they were anywhere near 6%.

&gt; They could asked that the banks be nationalized or socialized given that they had completely failed their purpose.

I agree in general, but I don't see how nationalised banks would have helped Greece right now. The banks are on the brink again, the Greek state would only have one more dysfunctional state agency to deal with.

&gt; They could have given back to Greece the interest on the Greek debt they possessed instead of keeping it for themselves.

The Greeks are receiving their share of the ECB's profits. Again, if Greece's problems are home-grown, it's really hard to ask other countries to give them money when quite a few of these countries are even poorer to begin with.

&gt; They could have asked to put in place policies that favored long term external investment to focus on growth and stability.

They did. The previous governments signed up to most measures and then didn't deliver most of those. Special interests where just too strong.

&gt; They could have done tons of things different, the first of all being buying the entirety of the insignificant Greek debt at the start of it all.

The problem is that the Euro treaty has a clause that exempts countries from having to bail each other out. That's because countries would rather not have to do it, and that's what happened. Don't want this? Further unify the union so competing interests aren't forced to cooperate.

At the end of the day, [insiders tells us](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/weg-aus-der-krise-was-in-griechenland-schiefgelaufen-ist-1.2427626) (German article, sorry) that after Syriza's election, the creditors expected the austerity measures to be relaxed. In return, they also expected Syriza to take on special interests that stopped the real measures. Unfortunately, Syriza only met the first half of their expectations. That's why the creditors are unrelenting, because Syriza, too, don't seem interested in fixing the real problems.

At no point was there an easy way out. Greece could have dropped out of the Euro and then would have still had to cut back its living standard once its cut off from financial markets. Or it could have stayed in with the help of the creditors and cut back and reformed in agreement with its creditors.",null,0,null,1435398769,null,0,false,0,cskdh4z,null,t3_3b8mqw,null,t1_cskdh4z,null,t1_csk74z7,null,null,null,1437535537,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

La gente sceglie uber proprio perché trova in esso un rapporto qualità prezzo migliore del attuale servizi offerto dai tassisti e regolato dallo stato. 


Quindi si, ti obbliga la legge, ma soltanto perché è legge oggi non vuol dire che questo sia giusto, o che sarà ancora legge anche domani. Uber sta cambiando il servizio dei tassisti pian piano in tutto il mondo, quello che vedi non sono criminali parassiti, ma gente che sta andando contro il modo attuale di fare le cose, per il bene di tutti. E non è facile, visto che si rischia multe, sequestro del mezzo, atti vandalici ed eventuale linciaggio da parte dei tassisti. 



&gt;è un pò come tu dica che, anziché fare il farmacista ho tutto il diritto di andare a spacciare in discoteca

Spacciare droga? L'esempio è sbagliato, visto che così non fai concorrenza alle farmacie. Se invece ti metti a vendere medicinali al angolo della strada e la gente compra da te perché trova prezzi più bassi e un servizio migliore, magari,  MAGARI, più che dire che sei un abusivo, non è che tutta la situazione dice che il sistema attuale delle farmacie sia marcio?

I wrote both in French in English not because I want you to read French, but because I would like to see you writing in your own language also. I want to read Spanish, Bulgarian and Swedish. The way of speaking in each language can differ and some subtleties are always lost in translations. It's always nice to see how people express things in different languages.

One factor governing the extent of SRD is if respondents can reasonably expect to remain anonymous. I would argue that this is no longer the case if you use telecommunication devices (both internet traffic and your phone can be tracked). 

Also, SDR is more pronounced when the question is perceived as sensitive, that is: if the topic is morally charged or linked to important positive or negative outcomes for the respondent.  

But you are correct, of course. We cannot disentangle the effects of SDR and of actual shifts in opinions. Since there is no link to the actual study, we do not even know if the study is representative and what, if any, measures have been taken to reduce SDR or control for SDR.

I still think it is very reasonable to assume that the increasing governmental pressure against LGBT topics and the LGBT community has made questions on the topic more ""sensitive"" for respondents. Expecting an increase in SDR is a reasonable guess.

Dalla stazione di Campi Flegrei puoi prendere la metropolitana o la circumflegrea (Cumana), oppure puoi usare gli autobus che ti portano a piazza Sannazzaro o piazza Vittoria. Per arrivare a Campi Flegrei devi percorrere più di metà della tangenziale fino a Fuorigrotta, e negli orari di massimo traffico questo potrebbe richiedere anche un'ora, anche se di Domenica in genere dovresti metterci una ventina di minuti/mezz'ora al massimo. A Fuorigrotta potresti usare anche il parcheggio dell'università, se costa ancora 2€ al giorno (chiedi maggiori informazioni a qualche redditor che frequenta ancora l'ateneo). Dista poche centinaia di metri dalla stazione della metro, ed è a raso ed incustodito. L'ho usato per molti anni (quasi 15) senza avere mai alcun problema, ma ormai sono 4/5 anni che non ci vado più.

Un'alternativa potrebbe essere quella del parcheggio Brin, a via Marina. Infatti, quando arrivi da Roma, il centro storico è vicinissimo al casello dell'autostrada.  Il parcheggio Brin si trova in una zona periferica, decisamente brutta; il piazzale all'ingresso funge da stazionamento per diverse linee di autobus che vanno verso il centro e verso il lungomare. Inoltre, se ti senti abbastanza votato all'avventura, puoi usare il [bike sharing](http://www.bikesharingnapoli.it/it/mappa-stazioni/), gratuito fino a mezz'ora di utilizzo. Il tempo a disposizione sarebbe ampiamente sufficiente per arrivare al lungomare, lasciare la bici, e muoversi poi da lì. Questo parcheggio lo uso ogni tanto, soprattutto di giorno e durante la settimana, e non ho mai avuto problemi.

Ci sono poi altri parcheggi decisamente più costosi nella zona del centro/lungomare, che ti consiglierei soltanto se devi passarci poche ore: le tariffe si aggirano sui 3€ all'ora.",null,0,null,1435400252,null,0,false,0,cskdrsh,null,t3_3bae8q,null,t1_cskdrsh,null,t3_3bae8q,null,null,null,1437388854,null,6,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,6,null

No...?

Unless you're only thinking in black and white.

Here's the thing. You said ""islamphobia is racism"".

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies discrimination, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls islamophobia racism. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""xenophobia"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of bigotry, which includes things from sexism to homophobia to anti-semitism.

So your reasoning for calling islamophobia racism is because random people ""call the brown people muslims?"" Let's get hindus and buddhists in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a protestant or a christian? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. Islamophobia is islamophobia and a subset of discrimination. But that's not what you said. You said islamophobia is racism, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all subsets of discrimination ""racism"", which means you'd call transphobes, ableists, and other bigots racists, too. Which you said you don't.

---

&gt;The national football team of the __Two Sicilies__ is the [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_(soccer\)) team of the [Two Sicilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Sicilies), which are a territory formed by the Island of [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily) and Hither Sicily (or Napolitania, which is the [Southern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy) part of the [Italian peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_peninsula)). The team is controlled by the *Federazione Lega Calcio Due Sicilie*. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] As the Two Sicilies are not a recognised state they are neither a member of [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA) nor [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA), and the team therefore is not eligible to enter either the [World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_World_Cup) or [European Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Football_Championship). However, from January 2010, they became a provisional member  of the [NF-Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NF-Board).

&gt;Hence the main problem was not the sex, or even the ""sex by surprise"" which I think is the legal term, but the lack of condom.

It might've been the original concern for the women, but the law is not limited to the perception of the victims, and for good reasons. And of course, ""sex by surprise"" is bloody obviously not a legal term. If anything it's a meme. It was brought into this mess by a Mark Stephens, Assange's lawyer at the time, to belittle the accusations made against his client.

&gt;He then waited some days in sweden to talk to the police and they said he was free to leave. Then some months later the Gothenburg prosecutors pick it up again and get interpol involved, resulting in the extradition trial in the UK.

That's not exactly the complete story though. The two women went to the position police on the 20th of August, three days after the alleged rape took place. The next day, the investigation into rape is dropped, but the investigation into molestation continues. The decision is almost immediately appealed by the two women's legal counsel, and eleven days later, on the 1st of September, the investigation is reinstated. It is now transferred to a prosecutor specialising in sex crimes. On the 15th of September, Assange's lawyer asks the prosecutor if there's any legal hindrance for Assange to leave the country, and is informed that there is none. Six days later, on the 21st of September, the prosecutor contacts Assange's lawyer to request a second interview. On the 27th of September, more than a month after the investigation was opened, Assange leaves Sweden. The lawyer claims to have been unable to reach Assange in the period between the 21st and the 27th, but he then also lied about being connected by the prosecutor. On the same day Assange left the country, a warrant for his arrest was issued. Since he had left the country, it was forwarded to Interpol.

As you can see, you got the order of events and lengths of time slightly wrong.

&gt;The fact remains he should have been interviewed in the UK, then charged as needed. That that did not happen makes the whole thing look weird as hell.

There are several problems with that, not least legally, and in the end he would still have had to be extradited to stand trial, so it would've made little to no difference. I disagree about it looking bad, but I also know a lot of people have worked really hard to make it seem weird, so I understand why it would appear as such.

&gt;Assange is a idiot (and many of the wikileaks people think so as well), but I think he has a well founded fear that something else is going on, and that thing could involve him in US prison.

It's not impossible, but there's literally no reliable evidence for any such conspiracy.",null,0,null,1435400781,null,0,false,0,cskdvja,null,t3_3b5tu0,null,t1_cskdvja,null,t1_cskcnmv,null,null,null,1437388957,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Les choses sont très bien dites et certains chiffres avancés donnent le vertige et permettent de comprendre pourquoi les actuelles exigences de l'Europe sont totalement idiotes et hypocrites, car parfaitement intenables.

En particulier ce passage, donné par un eurodéputé de droite luxembourgeois, ce moment de bon sens : 

&gt; Ces surplus primaires comme on dit, qu'est-ce que ça signifie ? Ça s'exprime en points de pourcentage de PIB. Il faut traduire cela en points de pourcentage de dépenses ou de recettes budgétaire. Il y a un ratio de multiplication de, vaguement 1 à 3-4, à mettre en œuvre, ce qui veut dire : si vous exigez de quelqu'un qu'il ait un surplus primaire de 1% du PIB, ça veut dire que ses recettes budgétaires soient supérieures de 3 à 4% à ses dépenses budgétaires. Et ainsi vous augmentez avec les points de PIB que vous ajouterez : demandez 2, vous avoisinerez les 10.  C'est démocratiquement totalement insoutenable, parce que pas possible de faire miroiter à la population grecque, lourdement éprouvée, depuis des années déjà, par des coupures dans tout, qu'il y ait un budget dont les recettes soient en excédent par rapport aux dépenses budgétaires de 5 ou de 7 ou de 10% pendant des décennies...""


Ça me paraît assez bien dit, et c'est un PPE qui le dit. J'ajoute personnellement que je ne crois pas que la Grèce physiquement, économiquement, capable de tenir de tels excédents budgétaires dans la situation catastrophique qui est la sienne (récession, chômage, etc.) alors que l'Allemagne dont l'économie est au top peine déjà à atteindre un 0% de déficit, et que même des pays à l'économie extrêmement performante et ayant de surcroît le contrôle de leur monnaie (genre la Suède) n'ont pas pu dépasser les 3,5% d'excédent budgétaire depuis 1976 (et jamais plus de 4 ans consécutifs).

Io non giustifico né attacco nulla.

Mi puoi venire a dire che i disturbi dell'identità sessuale NAS lo siano, ma quello è un altro discorso. Io non sono cocciuto, presenta degli studi scientifici riproducibili, fai fare una peer review, riforma il DSM e ti dirò che allora è malattia.

Hai idea di cosa sia una peer review, di cosa sia la riproducibilità, cosa significhi confutare? Se si, perché credi che certi """"""studi"""""" vengano considerati carta igienica? Perché c'è il complotto degli ebrei omosessuali?

&gt;

&gt;The __Movement for the Autonomies__ ([Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language): *Movimento per le Autonomie*, MpA) is a [regionalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regionalism_(politics\))  and [Christian democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_democracy)   [political party in Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Italy). It demands [economic development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development) and greater [autonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy) for [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily) and the other regions of [Southern Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy).

Grexit will be messy. He personally said 'NO' (at least we finally know that he is against Europe!), but Europe will say 'NO' in a few days due to technicalities.

Yesterday, a Greek navy of triremes with legions of hoplites took Normandy beach and rushed into Paris, the landing went unopposed. The wooden triremes are almost undetectable by radar and thus none knew a navy of Greece best warriors had been sailing along the coast of France. 

They also had help from the inside. 

On landing french taxis where waiting to drive the Greek to Paris through Caen, which fell within the hour, then the main force of the hoplites drove towards Paris. The traffic chaos due to the taxi drivers rioting had driven the communications to a standstill. The army couldn’t muster and the few that made through to Château de Versailles where overrun by legions of bloodthirsty hoplites. 
Last I’ve heard is that Über drivers are being rounded up and the Über app has been banned. France is also preparing to send a tribute to Greece.

L'iter corretto era: richiedere la liberalizzazione del mercato, aprire un'azienda chiamata uber, offrire il servizio.
Invece quello che fa uber è illegale punto, ma ha talmente tanti soldi che se ne frega della legislazione nazionale. A questo aggiungiamo la natura umana - idiota - che fa si che la gente si incazzi col pilota uber, anziché con l'azienda vera e propria .

Questo non risolve il problema del mercato del taxi, che andrebbe sicuramente ammodernizzato ma di sicuro la soluzione non è andare contro la legge, anche perché a pagarne lo scotto sono i tassisti e i consumatori.

But it was either ignored or consigned to a footnote by most of the British press.

&gt; Many of the men were anally raped, using knives, broken bottles, rifle barrels, snakes and scorpions. A favourite technique was to hold a man upside down, his head in a bucket of water, while sand was rammed into his rectum with a stick. Women were gang-raped by the guards. People were mauled by dogs and electrocuted. The British devised a special tool which they used for first crushing and then ripping off testicles. They used pliers to mutilate women's breasts. They cut off inmates' ears and fingers and gouged out their eyes. They dragged people behind Land Rovers until their bodies disintegrated. Men were rolled up in barbed wire and kicked around the compound.

And Euro *is your biggest problem*. Staying in Euro for Greece is very bad in the long run even if it didn't have ANY debt. Euro works great for the core-Euro countries (Germany, France, Benelux, ...) which have similar economic cycles. So the European Central Bank steers the monetary policy so that the economic cycles are smoothed out and everything runs great.

BUT, Greece is so far away from the Euro-core, that its economic cycles are different. So when Germany is in a recession, and ECB is giving the economy a boost so it doesn't crash, Greece is on the other hand in a boom, and the ECB boost *overheats* the Greek economy, which then spectacularly crashes. And when it crashes, Germany is in a boom again, so ECB is then *slowing down* the Eurozone, which only incredibly deepens the Greek depression.

Eurozone *CAN NOT* work for Greece because of how far it is from Germany and its European Central Bank.

Exiting the Eurozone will be dramatic in the short term, but almost all the bad things that can happen during that time, *have already happened!* And I can tell you this, if you exit the Eurozone, the one thing you *will* get is **certainty**, which you will never get with the Euro.",null,0,null,1435404129,null,0,false,0,cskeklm,null,t3_3b8sv8,null,t1_cskeklm,null,t1_cskdudm,null,null,null,1437389441,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

Again, I'm sure it happens. I even gave an example of being banned along similar lines. What I am saying, and what you are plainly refusing to understand, is that *accusations* of brigading don't have to be true, and are often made without any substantial evidence to back them up. I honestly see it all the time on Reddit, that people claim they are the sole voice of reason being attacked by organised efforts. In fact, this very thread is an example of it.

I'm in denial? You don't have a very good sample size, there. Two threads started by you. If you're as partisan usually as you're here, being to me, casting accusations of brigading left and right, maybe they were downvoted because of *you*, I don't know. Maybe people are being guided by their politics and downvote it because it doesn't fit in with those. I've certainly seen that happen enough the other way around. That's just the ugly truth of Reddit.

You are the one that's being disingenious when you say I'm in denial because I reject these claims without proof based on personal experience. You're also being disingenious if you continue to claim it's only ""fascists"" that do this.

My statement stands.

&gt;In the night of 17 August or the morning of 18 August 1978, on the island of [Cavallo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavallo_(island\)) (which lies off the south coast of [Corsica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsica)), Vittorio Emanuele discovered his yacht's rubber [dinghy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinghy) had been taken and attached to another nearby [yacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht). Arming himself with a [rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle), he attempted to board the yacht. He shot at a passenger he had awakened; the shot missed the passenger but mortally wounded [Dirk Hamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Hamer) (the nineteen-year-old son of [Ryke Geerd Hamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryke_Geerd_Hamer)), a passenger sleeping on the deck of another adjacent yacht. The prince admitted civil liability for the death in a letter dated 28 August 1978.  Dirk Hamer died of his wounds on 7 December 1978, and Vittorio Emanuele was arrested.

Sinon je pense que tu te trompes sur ton interprétation de reddit. Reddit n'est pas un monolithe qui est anglophone de manière inhérente. Le site est défini par ses utilisateurs et comment ils se distribuent et interagissent entre eux à travers différentes sous-communautés. Reddit est principalement anglophone car la majeure partie des utilisateurs sont des anglophones monolingues, de là à en conclure que le site est anglophone et qu'écrire en français *et* en anglais sur un même sujet est disruptif, cela me semble faux. /r/france est un bon contre-exemple, c'est un sucrerait parfaitement normal dans l'esprit du site, mais vu que la majeur partie des utilisateurs se communiquent en français, il s'agit de la langue principale.

Interestingly enough, the state of gay marriage in Germany is pretty similar to that of the US, until yesterday, before the SCOTUS decision: 

The government (Merkel more than her party, but she's still pretty uncontested at this point as the leading figure of the CDU) is cautiously in favor of it. 

Judging by the opinion polls there's a narrow majority among the population in favor of gay marriage. However, there's also a strong conservative opposition to it, and since it tends to be easier to uphold the status quo than to change something, that's what we have now.

Finally, the German version of the supreme court, the *Verfassungsgericht* has a strong history by now of kicking down unequal treatment of heterosexual and homosexual relations. In other words, the German supreme court seems strongly in favor of equal treatment - with two notable exceptions so far: opening marriage itself for gay couples, and adoption.

Here's my hypothesis why that might not change anytime soon, despite the Verfassungsgericht being in favor of equal treatment of gay and hetero couples in principle:

I suspect this has something to do with a certain christian-conservative base attitude of many, if not most Germans. We're, on average, not *crazy conservative* like the most extreme streams of conservative ideology in other countries (say, tea party conservative), but there's a baseline conservative attitude running even amongst the progressive parts of the German population - at least, that's my impression.

And for some reason, I get the feeling that 'baseline conservative' attitude means it's acceptable to grant most rights to gay couples, but don't open up the millennia old institution of marriage to them.

You can call it a ""referendum on austerity"", but the rest of the EU has made it clear by now, they don't want another full 'cut' of debt (but they're willing to move on the conditions of payment of it).

So, since 'austerity' seems to be linked to 'accepting debt', which in turn seems to be linked to 'being able to stay in the EZ', it appears the referendum is, indirectly, a referendum on the Euro itself.

&gt;

&gt;This article is about the [demographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics) features of the [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population) of [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), including [population density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density), [ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group), education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

&gt;[Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) has 60,808,000 inhabitants according to estimates current as of January 1 2015 (*ISTAT*)[(http://www.istat.it/en/archive/149007) Its population density, at 201 inhabitants per square kilometre (520/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) countries. However the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the [Po Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_Valley) (that accounts for almost half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome) and [Naples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples), while vast regions such as the [Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps) and [Apennines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apennines) highlands, the plateaus of [Basilicata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilicata) and the island of [Sardinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia) are very sparsely populated.

&gt;The population of Italy almost doubled during the twentieth century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the [Italian economic miracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_economic_miracle) of the 1950-60s. In addition, after centuries of net emigration, from the 1980s Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history. According to the Italian government, there were an estimated 5,000,073 foreign nationals resident in Italy.

Hinduism is a set of ideas, an ideology. It contains some barbaric concepts like the caste system. Also has some practiced other people may find offensive like open air cremation.

Now to see the opression this causes to untouchables and have the smell of burning flesh carried on the wind could quite reasonably male a person resent these practices.

Where are you drawing the line in what's an aceptabe level of objection.

Is a pettion to ban open air cremation opression? What about considering the whole ideology backward for its followers treatment of the lower castes? What if I advocate prison sentence for caste discrimination.

What about suti it's incredibly rare but if it still happened now and again would one be a bigot for getting outraged? What if there are preachers going around advocating it?

However those which were about non-Islamic xenophobia were usually downvoted extremely fast.

I am not sure about brigading, but there is a high likelyhood of it happening, since there have been [calls](http://www.dailystormer.com/reurope-warns-users-that-the-nazis-are-coming/) for it on reddit, the Daily Stormer and Stormfront among other places.

***

I don't want too make this about myself, you are doing that. I am worried about the subreddit. But to answer your last sentence and accusation: I am not a crusader with an agenda: I'm someone who likes this place, have been a long time poster on /r/europe and have noticed some worrying trends the last half year. I will repeat a sentence from the post of my original comment in this chain: 

&gt;while there is always an article about xenophobic Islamist behaviour on the frontpage, news of other kinds of blatant xenophobic actions are downvoted into oblivion in the new queue in an unnaturally fast way.

I don't think I'm singled out for attack or anything of the like. I think the sub is singled out for propaganda.

***

Unequivocal proof of brigading would be impossible to give. Even if the admins were to post statistics here (and they won't, they don't micromanage the subreddits this way), you could say they are lying. If reddit were to open up to it's servers to an independent audit (and no one even of the bigger and more relevant social media sites have done that, not Facebook, not Twitter, not Google) you could say it's a conspiracy of the politically correct.

Circumstential proof of brigading can be easily had. The calls for brigading on reddit, Stormfront, /int/, /pol/, the Daily Stormer. The very unusual voting patterns in the new queue. Reddit admins having shown in meta subs earlier that brigading happens on reddit. If that's not enough for you I cannot help but think you *are* being disingenious.

Christianity is problematic too, and only a good guideline for your life if you want society to go back 2.000 years. Still there are some differences, mainly in some core values and motifs.

Both value martyrdom, dying for their beliefs, but in slightly different ways: Christianity has a focus on personal suffering, the concept of original sin and being purged for it, while Islam sees more focus on waging battles, both in metaphor and literally.

Martyrdom can in both religions be achieved by killing and being killed for the faith, but Christianity focuses more on the ""being killed"" part, Islam more on the ""kill"" part. Or just compare the prophets - one was somewhat pacifistic (although not nearly as progressive as Christians try to portray him), the other a pedophile genocidal rapist mass murderer - this is not a defamation attempt, but a matter of fact.

Adding to this, Islam is more than ""just"" a religion, it's a way of life, an ideology, a guideline to live in. It sets out the rules for the whole life, society, dispensation of justice, government and so on.

My point was really just frustration with bigots justifying bigoted comments by saying ""it's not racist, i'm not a racist"". Even when it is still very bigoted, they almost try to claim that it *is* okay to be prejudice against a certain subset of people, when you're not cataloguing them by race, but some other trait.

I don't really get how you've brought oppression into this and I don't think your example is very relevant to this conversation. Were you trying to say that, in my example, white nationalists would be justified in their thinking other societies to be lesser than them because of examples like the caste system etc? 

I'll try to answer it, but I think i've misunderstood you...

The caste system is relatively engrained into Indian culture these days so would I be anti-Hindu or anti-Indian for disagreeing? Not really. I would just disagree with that certain aspect of Hindu or Indian culture. I'm not religious and there's plenty of parts of many different religions that I think are archaic and have no place in modern society, of which the caste system is one, in my opinion.

I disagree with it because it pre-judges a persons social standing based on who they are and where they come from. I dislike the system and not all Hindu's or Indian's before having met them. Which is my thinking, someone is bigoted if the pre-judge a person before having met them, or racist by judging someone based on their race/skin colour, before having met them, and in my example I felt like people think there is a moral difference between being a racist (bad) and being a bigot (not bad)",null,0,null,1435407274,null,0,1435407496,0,cskfb8o,null,t3_3b86ws,null,t1_cskfb8o,null,t1_cskexic,null,null,null,1437389597,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

That's not an appropriate comparaison because in the gay marriage case both rights and non-rights are shared interchangeably but in segregation they aren't shared.

More so, the segregation you refer to as defined in wikipedia means """"the act by which a (natural or legal) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds **without an objective and reasonable justification**, in conformity with the proposed definition of discrimination"", but objective and reasonable justification exist, most notably the one that one union can produce children and the other can't.

In all honestly, europe is fed up.

Man kann sowas nicht schreiben, ohne um Liebe, Verliebtheit und Rumfummeln zu wissen \^\^

Damit will ich nicht sagen, dass damals alle aus Liebe geheiratet haben, aber genausowenig würde ich ja sagen, das heute alle aus Liebe heiraten. Ich würde mal vermuten, dass ""damals"" oft das Heiraten zuerst kam, und dann mit Glück die Liebe.

    Setze mich wie ein Siegel
    dir auf das Herz,
    wie einen Siegelreif dir um den Arm,
    denn gewaltsam wie der Tod ist die Liebe,
    hart wie das Gruftreich das Eifern,
    ihre Flitze Feuerflitze, -
    eine Lohe oh von Ihm her!
    Die vielen Wasser vermögen nicht die Liebe zu löschen,
    die Ströme können sie nicht überfluten.
    Gäbe ein Mann allen Schatz seines Hauses um die Liebe,

Explain exactly what happened as factually, unemotionally and honestly as you can, and without either making accusations or defending yourself (e.g. don't constantly say ""I never did anything illegal!"" because it's not for you to decide) -- just the facts. Answer their questions.

&gt; Can I press for this guy to be arrested and booked?

You can make your complaint. What happens next is up to the police and the Staatsanwalt. You certainly shouldn't try to tell them their job by demanding they arrest and charge somebody.

&gt; the US, where at least you can't get pepper sprayed willy fucking nilly!!!

Sure you can get pepper sprayed willy fucking nilly. It may not be *legal*, but that doesn't mean it never happens.

people managed to get strangled by their tie which got cought in the elevator doors. elevator moved, RIP.

there is a gap between the floor/ceiling and the cabins wide enough to put a rather fat arm through.
the floor in the cabins is hinged at the back can move upwarts, so everything that protudes into the area of movement of the down going side will move the cabin floor upwards. 

for the going up side, the faces of the ceiling towards the cabin are not rectangular but slanted, that, say, a protuding foot wouldnt get cut off scissor like but pushed towards the cabin. the same flap/hinge mechanism in the cabins often exists on the floor/ceiling side too.

so if you manage to get a leg in there, you will have some nice fresh bruising and if youre particularly unlucky a fracture but thats it.

Regarding the above: I accept that it is humiliating, but it makes perfect sense from a pragmatic point of view. Someone in the thread about rape in Finland wrote that Somalis have a 17-fold number of rapes vs. the indigenous population (uncorrected for other factors).

If someone gets mistaken for a Somali but it turns out he is just looking like it, but from a low-risk group, it would be the same behaviour.

They were declared a [Nature Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Reserve) in 1980 and are included in the [Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Islands_of_Galicia_National_Park) (*Parque Nacional Marítimo-Terrestre das Illas Atlánticas de Galicia*) created in 2002.

&gt;In February 2007 the British newspaper [The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian) chose the beach of Rodas on the island of [Monteagudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteagudo), as ""the best beach in the world.""

Denying that is just footling. Silly. Disingenuous. A pointless refusal to interact with the world as it is in favour of some fantasy.

For example: the practice of Islamic courts; we've had Shine Bet courts in the UK partially recognised in law for some time; do we extend that? What's the status of a second or third wife when it comes to state financial support for families? Should we allow religious schools to teach a largely Islamic, as opposed to Christian. ethos? Should state and private enterprises accommodate demands for halal by just using only halal because its easier to manage? Or should halal slaughter be banned because of animal cruelty? Should we accept the creeping insinuation that Mohammed is always called 'the Prophet Muhammad' by the supposedly secular state broadcaster when he's no prophet of mine, nor of most people in the UK, and certainly not a capitalised one. Should we accommodate demands by only some sections of the Muslim community that we don't  share great art that just happens to depict Muhammad because they, and only they, will take offence? What about the pressure not to publish or sell 'The Satanic Verses', or to pull the repeat of Tom Holland's very interesting documentary on the historical facts around the origin of Islam from it's scheduled showing because of protests, again from a vocal minority (but who knows what proportion of the Muslim population tacitly greed)? What do we do about arranged marriages with girls that are very young who are removed from school? What about genital mutilation? What is it about the Muslim community in the UK that seems to provide a disproportionate number of criminal offenders and gangs who sexually abuse underage and predominantly white, non-Muslim girls?

Plus spécifiquement, le FMI ne veut pas entendre parler d'une réduction de la dette (le FMI c'est comme quand tu empruntes à la mafia : il est même pas imaginable de ne pas rembourser), mais propose en revanche une restructuration de celle-ci : il s'agirait de pouvoir baisser les taux d'intérêt et/ou de donner plus de temps pour rembourser (faire passer la maturité de 30 à 50 ans par exemple). Ce dont Athènes serait prêt à se satisfaire car ce serait déjà une sacrée bouffée d'oxygène. Le FMI est pleinement conscient que la dette Grèce, dans sa forme actuelle, n'est pas soutenable et que si on continue à se contenter de ""nouveaux prêts pour rembourser les anciens en échange de nouvelles mesures d'austérité"" (ce qu'on fait en boucle depuis 2009), la Grèce finira forcément en défaut de paiement, tôt ou tard.

En revanche, même ça, l'Eurozone ne veut absolument PAS en entendre parler. Côté UE, il est rigoureusement hors de question de restructurer la dette grecque, ne serait-ce que parce que ça demanderait d'être validé par certains parlements nationaux qui ne sont pas du tout acquis à cette cause (Allemagne et Finlande, notamment) alors qu'il faut l'accord de tous les pays. L'UE se fout un peu de savoir si la Grèce sera forcée de faire défaut dans 5 ans, elle est dans une optique court-termiste de sauver les apparences à l'échéance 1 semaine, 1 mois, 1 an... 

Le problème c'est qu'à l'inverse, autant l'UE serait prête à se montrer un peu plus coulante sur les réformes exigibles de la Grèce, autant le FMI met un max de pression pour une austérité maximale et ne veut rien lâcher en ce qui concerne les réformes demandées.


Si bien que la Grèce se retrouve dans une situation inextricable où elle doit à la fois satisfaire les exigences du FMI en terme de réforme, et celles de l'UE en terme de paiement d'une dette insoutenable, et ne peut bénéficier des volontés de compromis ni de l'un ni de l'autre. Athènes n'a donc pas tort quand elle dit que ses créanciers refusent tout compromis : parce que les créanciers ne sont pas d'accord entre eux sur les compromis qu'ils peuvent accorder à Athènes, et que du coup, Tsipras n'obtient rien.

It's a forum, it's open. My car is German, I speak whatever language I want in it with whomever i want in it as long as they understand it. It's the core concept of the Internet! Facebook is American too, that doesn't prevent people from using it in their own language. *Are you really allergic to languages other than English?* 



I'm learning other languages and would really like the Italians and Spaniards to double their comments so I can learn while staying on reddit. My own English skills were lacking before I joined this site. I improved my writing skills thanks to reddit. I don't have exposure to English elsewhere in my daily life. So trust me, that's a very good way to learn languages. Unless you're an arrogant stuck-up native English speaker, you have no reason to oppose those initiatives.

Basically you have to buy a bag (funda) that's 120 x 90 x 40 cm  or less and fit your bike in it (removing the wheel and pedals and maybe more depending on your bike size). You need to get there very early and be one of the first people on the platform and get to your car to scope out a space for your bike where the luggage racks are. As I remember, the big racks are at the far end of the car as you walk down the platform. If you get there later, they might not let you on if there's no space for your bike. The ""package wagon"" that Kinkozes mentioned is supposed to exist, but I don't know anyone who has had any success accessing it. The ""interventores"" seem to always direct folks to put their stuff in the luggage racks of their train car. You might be able to get away with a slightly longer bag, but the 90cms wide is already pushing it, so be careful not to go any bigger or it will stick out in the aisle too much.

The bus company ALSA also sells a cheap bag that allows you to transport a bike by bus.

null,false,pixeltje4,EURO,European Union,null,"There are no black, Asian, Arab or white races, the only race is the human race. That their is no other race than homo sapiens means that the construct of race is entirely made of *presumed* differences. These presumed differences are highly flexible. For example, even though the Irish clearly have a white skin they were called white n.gg.rs in the early 1900s, so some people didn't consider the Irish as truly white. That they weren't considered truly white was also due to their dissident religion, namely Catholicism. So it is clear that something as race wasn't *only* determined by biological characteristics, but also by someone's unbiological features, like religion. The purpose of constructing these races was to create a fundamentally 'other': which is someone who represents the fundamental difference and alienness compared to the self.

What is currently happening with muslims is practically the same, which is to construct a presumed fundamental difference between 'us' and 'them'. This difference (Islam) is made into something that is supposed to define and determine 'the muslim', thereby creating the 'other'. Nowadays the tactics has changed, the fundamental difference isn't said to be caused by someone's biological characteristics. The function however of creating a fundamental 'other', a difference which is now supposedly caused by an overly dominant 'culture' (which is a very abstract term), has stayed the same.

I mean, we had our fair share of attacks in France, and sure enough I'd love it if these were the lasts. But let's be real, until hatred is erased from this world (lol), it's just gonna happen. I still have a way higher probability of getting bumped by a car and killed by a truck running me over than I have of ever encountering a Muslim terrorist, yet you don't see me complaining about cars.

More importantly, those events are used to promote unhealthy reactions and politics. In France, for example, we're facing a wave of sickening calls to reduce freedom and boost government surveillance. Surveillance already happens. Most of the guys who commited terror acts (all of them actually IIRC!) in the recent years *were* under surveillance. What good it did to us.

The point is, by focusing too much on those issues, we're losing sight of what we should do and instead adopt a reactionary attitude which only leads to disaster (FFS we had 5 years of Sarkozy whose motto was pretty much ""1 event = 1 law"", and it created a spaghetti of bullshit, can we try to steer clear of that?).

What we currently see is what's called a ""[spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_\(public_relations\))"" in politics or public relations. Psychologists would call it [framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_\(psychology\)).

This spin (or frame) has two components:

Firstly, there is the idea of ""homosexualism"". In some conservative circles in the US, a similar spin is advanced: ""the homosexual agenda"". The idea is to paint the fight for personal rights of LGBT people as an attempt of the LGBT community to influence ""straight"" people. There is no such thing, of course. Ironically, the awful attempts to ""heal"" LGBT people have demonstrated clearly, that you cannot change someones sexuality. Also, the fact that most all LGBT people were raised by straight parents shows that sexuality does not simply ""rub off"". Lastly, the many examples of homosexuality in many mammals shows that it seems to occur naturally and isn't some form of human ""kink"". It also demonstrates that it does not endanger the respective populations.

Secondly, to back up the idea of ""homosexualism"", the call for basic human rights is reframed as some form of political propaganda *against* straight people.

We currently see the similar spins in parts of the US and in the two conservative political parties in Germany. Gay marriage is only about what consenting people decide to do. Some conservatives, however, want to spin this as a violation of their freedom. It takes a bit of, shall we say moral flexibility, to claim that not being able to dictate others how to live their lives is a limitation of your freedom.",null,1,null,1435411960,null,0,false,0,cskgjpv,null,t3_3ba8qb,null,t1_cskgjpv,null,t1_cskg4is,null,null,null,1437390136,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

&gt;But he said his comments about women in laboratories had struck ""such a discordant note"".

&gt;He said they were at odds with the university's aim to create a working environment where women felt supported.

&gt;Prof Arthur added in a statement in the staff news section of the UCL website that Sir Tim's offer of resignation was his personal choice and the honourable thing to do.

&gt;He said that despite many calls for him to reinstate Sir Tim, there had been ""very significant"" representations to him not to do so - and not only from women in science.

Attention les situations sont pas forcément super comparables :

- La Grèce bénéficie temporairement d'une charge de la dette réduite parce qu'il y a un moratoire sur les intérêts de certains de ses emprunts. Moratoire qui finira par prendre fin (d'où la pression pour qu'elle rembourse un maximum de capital le plus vite possible, histoire de pas être trop pénalisée par les intérêts par la suite), en 2022 je crois.

- Dès qu'on fait des calculs en points de pourcentage de PIB, la question de la croissance vient jouer un rôle majeur. Comme le fait remarquer le lien de La Tribune que j'ai donné ""un excédent primaire de 1 % du PIB avec une économie stagnante peut être équivalent à un excédent de 3 % du PIB avec une croissance théorique de 3 %"" (équivalent en terme de poids de l'austérité).

DClauzel got attacked for speaking two languages, not three.

And it looks like you could actually use his comments to improve your french =P (sorry I had to do it again). I massively improved my English skills on reddit. So yes, this is the way to go if you want to improve. You should support it instead of making fun of him or caricaturing him.

&gt;After all, this is a primarily English forum, and English is the lingua franca worldwide and in Europe.

Are you allergic to foreign languages?  Why is it bothering you so much that Dclauzel writes both in French and in English since you can obviously understand English (and even maybe both)?

It's a forum, it's open, it's free. People should stop dictating how others should express themselves, as long as it's understandable to the majority. And people should really stop taking offense for things that have no impact on them whatsoever. ""*Reddit is an american website*"" mentality is really against  the core concept of the Internet. It's very sad. Because ultimately, it only makes *you* look arrogant.

null,false,sachalamp,null,null,null,"&gt; No, that law is not equal with respect to being able to marry the other consenting adult you want to marry

You're beating the bush here. ""What/who you want"" != law. The law does not suit you, that is correct, but the law as defined in your state is equal to all. The law, as you described it is

&gt;only gay marriage is legal, and heterosexual marriage isn't

not ""what one wants"". You're trying to broaden the very limits you've initially created.

&gt;It does make sense to redefine institutions. We redefined interracial marriage just so. Before that, X was ""marriage between two adults of the same race."" Then, we extended that definition.

It sometimes makes sense to redefine institutions in specific cases (if it makes sense) *and* if a majority is present. That is if gay marriage would be comparable to normal marriage, could produce children etc and 50%+1 adults are or want to be in a gay marriage.

Also, ""marriage between two adults of the same race."" is not, as far as I am aware of, an important distinction. Even if it were, removing the distinction still allows functionality, two adults of different sex from different races can produce children.

&gt;You don't have to be married to make children. My imaginary society would allow cross-marital procreation. Those children could even be used to create extended cross-family networks.

Marriage is first and foremost a social safety net for the child, not having it is detrimental to it. My point is a concept that's not self sustainable does not make sense unless you want to reduce natality or quality of children raised in the system.

Griechenland hat massive Einschnitte im Lebensstandard hingenommen, da ist quasi alles zusammen gestrichen worden was geht (und dann noch ein bissl obendrauf), da sagen die Leute zu recht dass weitere Einsparungen nicht akzeptabel sind. Wenn dann andererseits der Durchschnittsdeutsche in der Bild liest dass es in Griechenland immer noch kein Katasteramt gibt und dass dutzende Milliarden Steuern uneingetrieben bleiben sinkt da natürlich die Akzeptanz für mehr Geld nach Griechenland.

Fragt sich wer Schuld daran trägt dass statt echten Reformen vor allem die Renten zusammen gekürzt wurden. Nach dem was man so über die Gläubigerseite (vor Allem den IMF) liest scheint das nicht nur Griechenland zu sein.

Bezüglich Nummer eins frage ich mich aber ganz ehrlich warum Griechenland jetzt wieder einen Schuldenschnitt braucht. Nach der Syriza-Wahl schien mir Konsens zu sein dass die Höhe der griechischen Schulden sowieso eher eine politische Frage sei und dass die Zinslast auch nicht das Problem ist, sondern dass die Forderungen nach dem Primärüberschuss sind wo der Hase im Pfeffer liegt.

&gt;There is an international conspiracy whose target is the complete destruction of my country. They began in 1975 aiming at Modern Greek civilization, continued with the distortion of our modern history and our national identity and they are now trying to eliminate us biologically as well through unemployment, hunger and impoverishment. 

&gt;If Greek people don’t rise as one in order to prevent them, the danger of Greece becoming extinct is evident. I place it within the next ten years. There will be nothing left of us but the memory of our civilization and our battles for freedom.

[…]

&gt;For the situation to reach that end, the country’s real financial status had to be distorted, so that foreign Banks would become nervous and raise the loan interest rates to prohibitive figures. That odious project began with the phony raising of the Public Deficit from 9,2% to 15%. 

&gt;Mr. Papandreou could have dealt with the financial crisis (which as I have said reflected the European one) by borrowing from foreign Banks under the usual interest rate of under 5%. If he had done that, there wouldn’t have been the slightest problem for our country. In fact, the opposite would have occurred; because we were on an economic growth path, our standard of living would certainly have risen.
  
&gt;However, Mr. Papandreou had already begun his conspiracy against the Greek people since the summer of 2009, when he secretly met with Strauss-Kahn, with the objective of driving Greece under the domination of the IMF. The information concerning this meeting was released by the former President of the IMF himself.

Das ist die Kehrseite der Medaille. Wie weit verbreitet und tiefgehend solche Verschwörungstheorien sind zeigen die [Drohungen gegen und Verfolgung von Andreas Georgiou](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/chief-greek-statistician-charged-for-revealing-true-size-of-debt-a-882942-druck.html), dem 2010 neu berufenen Leiter des griechischen Statistikamtes ELSTAT. 

Ihm wird von entlassenen ehemaligen Angestellten allen Ernstes vorgeworfen, die Höhe der griechischen Staatsschulden in betrügerischer Weise zu übertreiben. Also genau das Gegenteil von dem, wofür sein Vorgänger entlassen wurde, samt vieler Mitarbeiter - dem Beschönigen der Schulden. Sachlich unhaltbar sind die Vorwürfe gegen ihn allemal:

&gt;Mr. Georgiou's line of defense is that most of the revisions that corrected the budget deficit from a projected 6 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 to a whopping 15.4 percent 12 months later were undertaken during the PASOK-led government of Georgios Papandreou. They also took place before Georgiou had taken up his post. Furthermore, Greece had already agreed on a bailout with its euro-zone partners and with the IMF before he took over the reins at ELSTAT. Under his leadership, the deficit only rose from 13.6 to 15.4 percent, a substantial revision to be sure, but irrelevant to Greece's bailout.

&gt;Xafa says that all Georgiou did when he took over as head of the Greek statistical service was to comply with EU rules. She notes that nearly half of the revisions undertaken under Georgiou's watch were the result of adding loss-making entities such as rail, public transport, defense and other sectors to the government books. ""These losses were real and had to be financed, whether they were included in the deficit"" or not, she says.

Some, maybe. I don't know. I do know that some homosexual behavior is learned/forced however and it's detrimental to the ones that were forced into this behavior to have society tell them they are normal. Somewhere along the way something unjust happened to them and they changed. Having society normalizing such instances is like normalizing mental illness to mark it as ""cured"".

I'm not allergic to foreign languages (I speak 3 of them, in fact, and I love language) but I think it's in poor taste to force any language on people, especially one that the majority of the EU and the majority of the world does not speak.

Some try to claim that they want to influence children to become homosexual, but that simply is not true. As I've argued in a comment above:

&gt;  Ironically, the awful attempts to ""heal"" LGBT people have demonstrated clearly, that you cannot change someones sexuality. Also, the fact that most all LGBT people were raised by straight parents shows that sexuality does not simply ""rub off"". Lastly, the many examples of homosexuality in many mammals shows that it seems to occur naturally and isn't some form of human ""kink"". It also demonstrates that it does not endanger the respective populations.

To reiterate: There is not a shred of scientific evidence that you can ""make"" people homosexual. Also, there is [growing evidence of genetic factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation) governing sexuality.

The linked article also cites research that shows that even changing the gender of boys shortly after birth does not change their sexuality. 

&gt;  In the 1960s and '70s, it was common in developed countries for doctors to castrate boys born with a micropenis and have them raised as girls. However, this practice has come under attack, **because even though these boys were raised as girls, they nearly all report as adults that they are sexually attracted to women**. This suggests that their sexual orientation was determined by their genetic gender at birth.

If even a surgical procedures followed by years of being treated as a girl cannot change a heterosexual boy's sexual orientation, what could gay ""propaganda"" possibly hope to achieve?

There is even a growing body of research on the evolutionary benefits of homosexuality:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation#Sexual_orientation_and_evolution

This evolutionary perspective is important because it further supports the idea of genetically determined sexuality. It also demonstrates that homosexuality is not a threat to a population. In fact, it might well be an advantage.

Not really; they're stuck in a trap themselves. I'd suspect some of the concessions asked by the IMF hurts too much for them to want to take all the responsability to accept or not. But they don't want to get out of the EU without explicit agreement from the population either, because they've been elected as negociators to stay in.

So they want to draw legitimacy from the population's will and defer part of the responsability on a vote. 

People will say YES or NO and they will follow it, without fraud, as far as i know. Either case will hurt, but they'll be able to say ""look, we asked you and did what you thought was less worse"" to the voters.

Yes it's politics, but i think it's one of the best thing a democratic gov could do in that case when facing troubled time : He asks what they want for their own future. I think i honestly respect Tsipras for that choice.

In the imaginary case that Greek government takes the agreement to the parliament, if the government's members downvote it to a large extent and opposition's positive votes are enough that the agreement is validated, this would constitute a de facto failure of the government and it would have to resign. Even if the agreement as a whole was upvoted by the whole government, the subsequent parts of it would have to be upvoted one by one and no sensible person would expect that the government would upvote all of them if they largely disagree, so we end up in a similar situation as above, with Potami and ND and perhaps others upvoting the laws that government members of parliament downvote, so a de facto collapse of the government.

It was obvious to any sensible person that the agreement proposed by creditors had zero chances to either be upvoted or, even if upvoted, to have any positive effects to Greek economy. Creditors obviously wanted to end the game but I am not sure whose fault was it exactly. Creditors might have made a plan, to accept with open arms the new radical government and then force it to self-destruct in order to reestablish the previous government and offer more sensible agreements, but I might very well be wrong and the opposite might be true: that Syriza wanted to stress the situation and portray the creditors as the stubborn insensitive accountants before switching tracks.

D'ailleurs aujourd'hui le mot démocratie est synonyme de capitalisme. La première chose qu'on demande aux élus, c'est bien gérer le pognon, lutter pour la croissance et réduire le chômage.


Et pour répondre à ta question, je pense qu'un des problèmes est la perte de conscience politique des individus, ainsi que leur perte de confiance en eux-mêmes et vis à vis du collectif . Les gouvernements ne sont pas forcément toujours incompétents et sans culture, d'ailleurs les gouvernements ne se résument pas aux quelques personnes qu'on peut voir à la télé. Ils font aussi compter les centaines de conseillers, les milliers de lobbyistes, les dizaines d'institutions nationales et transnationales...
Seulement on vit dans le mythe qu'il est bon de déléguer le pouvoir  à des représentants, parce qu'ils sont plus à mêmes de prendre les bonnes décisions. C'est rassurant. Mais c'est faux, par contre c'est prendre le risque d'élire des incompétents, des tarés autoritaires, et autres salauds gestionnaires.

 &gt; marriage IS universal

It's not. For one thing ""marriage"" is an English word, and there are different translations in diffferent languages. Just like with ""love"" - in some languages romantic love is same word as parential love or brotherly love, in some it isn't. Same with the meaning of ""marriage"".

For another thing - rules differ - for example there are cultures marriages allowing more than 2 people, allowing or forbidding divorces on various conditions, there were even ""probatory""  marriages (during which you were not supposed to have kids, yet it was a marriage - that was BTW the relationship between st Joseph and st Mary when she got pregnant with Jesus - would be huge scandal if not for the God intervention).

There was ""brotherly union"" institutions in ancient Catholic church, using the same symbolism as modern marriage (a mass, priest, binding of hands, kissing the brother) - saints Sergius and Bachus were married"" that way. It was called adelphopoiesis - look it up.

There were indian tribes where there was institution of two-spirits - man who were considered woman and vice-versa, and they in some tribes could form (from our point of view) homosexual marriage.

And of course now there are countries and people that view marriage as human+human. It's not universal if people disagree.",null,0,null,1435414480,null,0,false,0,cskhg0j,null,t3_3b8k2h,null,t1_cskhg0j,null,t1_cskgx0x,null,null,null,1437390748,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

That's what I'm getting at. The police make a mess on all sorts of things - Rotherham, Hillsborough and so on. And in every case, the people who got treated badly were working class.

When the middle classes are involved it's different. The police did try to stitch up that Tory MP with a tissue of lies - but he turned round and sued them.

I think the working classes get treated differently because they have no political power - and that's because they don't vote. Even the Labour party has turned middle class for the simple reason that the middle classes vote and the working classes don't and they'd never get into power at all if they had to rely on working class voters.

They “want” equal access to an institution that the other group already has acces to. I was using “But we don’t want to marry a same-sex person” as something the members of the excluded group would typically say, faced with this inequality.     
    
&gt; You're trying to broaden the very limits you've initially created.    
    
It’s the other way around. The opponents of gay marriage *restrict* the definition to “marriage is between a consenting man and woman”, while the proponents of gay marriage say that the definition is “marriage is between consenting adults”.     
     
Your argument for that restriction is “because this is how it was in the past.” (In your words: “It would not make sense to redefine X, since X is de facto”) That is a weak argument, because a lot of de facto unequal access to institutions also existed in the past, such as interracial access to certain schools or marriage. The argument “but X is de facto” always lost in the long term.
    
&gt; Marriage is first and foremost a social safety net for the child    
    
The procreated children would have the social safety net of the same-sex parents.

Guess what gay people do. They force their own beliefs and expect others to conform. 

&gt;It's not. For one thing ""marriage"" is an English word, and there are different translations in diffferent languages. Just like with ""love"" - in some languages romantic love is same word as parential love or brotherly love, in some it isn't. Same with the meaning of ""marriage"".

&gt;For another thing - rules differ - for example there are cultures marriages allowing more than 2 people, allowing or forbidding divorces on various conditions, there were even ""probatory"" marriages (during which you were not supposed to have kids, yet it was a marriage - that was BTW the relationship between st Joseph and st Mary when she got pregnant with Jesus - would be huge scandal if not for the God intervention).

&gt;There was ""brotherly union"" institutions in ancient Catholic church, using the same symbolism as modern marriage (a mass, priest, binding of hands, kissing the brother) - saints Sergius and Bachus were married"" that way. It was called adelphopoiesis - look it up.
There were indian tribes where there was institution of two-spirits - man who were considered woman and vice-versa, and they in some tribes could form (from our point of view) homosexual marriage.

Again, exceptions. As for 2 or more people, there would still be a need for different sexes to be present to produce a child.

&gt;And of course now there are countries and people that view marriage as human+human. It's not universal if people disagree.

Because of a relentless agenda and social/academic ostracizing anyone who opposes it, as it is with racial differences studies. When you can't voice your opinion against something, that something is not universal, it's forced.

It's not a matter of ""wronging"" a country on a national scale, but rather personal interactions.

Er, no. The EU is the UK's major trading partner, but the UK is not the EU's. For example, Germany is the UK's largest trade partner in the EU. The UK imports about €75bn annually from Germany - but German intra-EU exports annually are €625bn. The UK is therefore only 12% of German intra-EU exports. And Germany only exports 57% within the EU - its total exports are more like €1,100bn, of which the UK is 6.8%.""Heavily reliant"" on UK trade that isn't.

Ireland *is* more dependent, of course - the UK is about 25% of our export market. But we're probably the most closely linked economy to the UK by quite a margin.

These attacks have the Islamic State as a red thread. So it's plainly not as simple as ""Put the ones who did it in prison and move on"". That is a gross oversimplification of the facts, and frankly sticking your head in the sand.

Look, I'm not trying to ignore the context behind these attacks and present them as isolated cases. I'm well aware of the background and strategy of people and groups behind it. But at the end of the day, that changes nothing. 

State services already exist that have catching terrorists and preventing attacks as a job, so we already have all the reasonable mechanisms we need to deal with terrorism. Does that guarantee a 100% success rate in attack prevention? No, and nothing ever will. Occasionally, people are going to die. Everybody accepts this fact when it comes to victims of violent and organized crime, and if not for sensationalist hysteria in media and politics, they would have accepted the same for terrorism. 

Ultimately, there is little meaningful discussion to be had here. People want to lash out in anger, and I understand that, although anger makes for a shitty debate. But when people start channeling that anger to propose policies that severely undermine the very foundations of our society, such as equality and individual freedom, that's where I draw the line. Until terror attacks take a few thousand lives in a short time span, they are objectively politically irrelevant. 

&gt; Below me I can see posts that claim /r/Europe has been ""co-opted"" get massive numbers of upvotes. And, of course, there are the people of /r/European who claim the exact same thing, except that it's left-wing people who have co-opted /r/Europe and are shitting up the discussion.

As is often the case in situations like that, those two points are not equally valid. There are plenty of right-leaning posters on /r/europe, in fact I would go as far as to say they make up the majority. Which is not very unusual either considering that Europe itself has been politically dominated by the center-right for quite some time now. Bottom line, every view in the political spectrum is represented among the regular users in /r/europe, even arguably the far right ones when articulated in a reasonable way. During the last year, the situation on the subreddit deteriorated heavily.

/r/european posters come from the extreme end of the political spectrum. They are not compatible with the mainstream political spectrum in Europe, including both left and right wing politics. This is, after all, why they have a subreddit of their own. I don't go there myself, and I doubt many /r/europe regulars do.

First let me quote you the sixth articel of our basic law

&gt;Article 6
[Marriage – Family – Children]
 
&gt;(1) Marriage and the family shall enjoy the special protection
of the state.
 
&gt;(2) The care and upbringing of children is the natural right of
parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them. The
state shall watch over them in the performance of this duty.

&gt; (3) Children may be separated from their families against the
will of their parents or guardians only pursuant to a law,
and only if the parents or guardians fail in their duties or
the children are otherwise in danger of serious neglect.

&gt;(4) Every mother shall be entitled to the protection and care
of the community.

&gt;(5) Children born outside of marriage shall be provided by
legislation with the same opportunities for physical and
mental development and for their position in society as
are enjoyed by those born within marriage.

Marriage between a man and a women gets special treatment in germany because the state wants to promote having children. Our birth rates are atrocious and people who marry and get children get special treatment by the government to promote that. Giving homosexual couples the same rights and treatments simply goes against that. That's what the CDU is arguing and is also why they're in favor of the ""eingetragenen Lebenspartnerschaft ""

I understand that way of thinking and think that families with children should get benefits. On the other hand I don't understand why gay couples shouldn't be able to adopt children and in return get the same benefits since I don't see a difference between a gay couple with children and a hetero couple also with children. I just don't think that the whole issue is as black and white as people make it out to be. We still have a huge christian part in our population and the CDU also tries to cater to them.

An additional reason people want to take their money out is because they may implement capital controls (partly in response to a bank run). So if you need to withdraw a lot for whatever reason, you are SOL. 


Another reason: Collapose of the Greek banking sector. Currently, the Greek banks are being kept afloat by the ELA. If that money runs out and isn't increased to massive withdrawals, then the Greek banks will collapose and they flat out won't have any money left to give to anyone. (I'm not sure what Greek deposit insurance is like, however, so that may not be too much of an issue if there is a credible chance they will earn their deposits back through a system similiar to the FDIC, but still, that process still can take a while meaning they may be left without money for an undetermined period of time, which still isn't good.)",null,0,null,1435415914,null,0,false,0,cski0vu,null,t3_3bac5o,null,t1_cski0vu,null,t1_cskgnbk,null,null,null,1437391010,null,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6,null

No, I use that word because the far right has gotten a grip on this subreddit and any incentive from the mods or other users to fight it is met by incredible hostility. (Which just shows how big that grip actually is)

&gt; And where are the death threats? I have yet to see any death threats on /r/Europe[1] . Please provide sources, because I really think you're being dishonest here.

Honestly, I think most people here are dishonest. They're shouting that they're being repressed, even though there is absolutely no repression going on. Most people complaining just dislike that their opinions and posts are against the rules and getting removed. They're mad because the mods are properly taking care of the house rules of the subreddit.

And most people that shout oppression, aren't even aware of the fact of a lot of features /r/europe has that allows users to view what the mods are doing. They're just shouting oppression because they want to break the rules.",null,0,null,1435415953,null,0,false,0,cski1hj,null,t3_3b6vbp,null,t1_cski1hj,null,t1_cskhdo9,null,null,null,1437391013,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null
