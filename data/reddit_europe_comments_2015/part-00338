Since this was one of my main areas of research for my MPhil degree, the issue is very dear to me, but sadly still largely under-appreciated (though a recent piece in *Nature* helped a lot... reference at the end), I'd be glad to explain, entirely outside of political issues.

So if you're interested - read on :) It's gonna be really long, because I need to give a somewhat extensive historical overview but I think it pays to be thorough here, and the context is invaluable.

So I'll have to split this in two parts, this comment being the first, and my reply to this comment being the second.

Even though the issue is as I mentioned still far under-appreciated, I'm glad to say that even the more conservative researchers in evolutionary theory are starting to warm to the idea that evolution involves many more things than just genes / alleles. 

As the Nature-piece I mentioned demonstrates, the current debate is not *whether* such things as multi-level inheritance &amp; selection exist and play an important part in evolution for the populations in which they occur - but whether our current state-of-the-art can accommodate these insights appropriately without large modification or whether we need paradigm changes to do so.

A historical overview concerning the situation:

The fact that offspring tend to resemble their parents in many ways (for many traits on many levels) has pretty much always been known - and smart people have wondered about this at least since the ancient greek philosophers. 

Similarly, we know from all of history that humans have always wondered about the vast multitude of biological forms around them, and how they came about. Most creation myths and secular philosophies had some accounts of the origin of everything, how it all comes together and how it develops/evolves.

It was also known that some heritable traits influence the health / well-being / survival, and general behavior of the offspring. For humans, we had pretty good how a large class of that works - namely, all dispositions and strategies heritable through social learning. We were actively doing the passing on, so there was no real mystery as to how come offspring resemble their parents (and their social circles) concerning such behavioral traits.

What we didn't have a clue about is how *anatomical* traits were inherited. (Actually, while we have very very good theories, we are still discovering a vast wealth of new complexities concerning this).

Without ways to probe, visualize, and intervene on a cellular and sub-cellular level, no good theories were forthcoming for the longest time. 

In any case - the study of how individuals come to have certain traits (and later also their relative distribution in populations) has pretty much always been called ""genetics"" (or a local variation thereof) - since the latin/greek root of ""genesis"" / ""genesys"" means the ""coming about"" / ""creation"" / ""development"" of something.... even long before we had anything like our current gene-concept, and before we even used the term ""gene"".

Around the turn of the 18th to 19th century, Lamarck produced his theories about how the multitude of biological forms (phenotypes) come about - where you start with traits from your parents, then modify and acquire new traits over your lifetime. And if you reproduce, some of the acquired / modified traits may be inherited as well.

This brings us to the all-import concept of ""inheritance units"". In the 19th century, the concepts of cells and of germination were beginning to get somewhat more well-defined in biology. The main figures in the early 19th century were Henri Dutroche and François Raspail, the latter of which suggested that cells come from other cells (though the ""cell"" concept was still somewhat vague).

When this was developed further, the concept of germination became de-facto standard for explaining inheritance of anatomical traits with August Weismann at the end of the 19th century. 

Not too long before, Darwin had merely spoken of rather unspecified ""gemmules"" as carriers of heritable information. Weismann instead developed the so-called ""Germ plasm theory"", whose main theorem was that the heritable information exists only in germ-line cells. Thus all the information you pass on to your descendants in this way is set by the time you get it - this was notable for explicitly excluding the possibility of Lamarckian effects in evolution. 

About three quarters of a century later, we discovered DNA and developed the modern evolutionary synthesis. This was so revolutionary and so productive that it came to dominate the general perception both among scientists in the field, outside of the field as well as the general public. For the first time, we had a concrete physical handle - an exceptional candidate for a ""unit of inheritance"".

And since no mechanisms were known (or ""on the horizon"") for how the heritable information in the germ-line could be altered after birth, the ""Weismann doctrine"" became the received view.

But while it might seem so, non-genetic dimensions of evolution weren't totally neglected. Not long into the modern evolutionary synthesis, John Maynard Smith and George Price developed the theory of ""Evolutionary Stable Strategies"" ,which can, but don't have to be genetically inherited - many such strategies are inherited through social learning.
Later, Maynard-Smith and Erös Szathmary developed an account of ""major transitions in evolution"" in one of the best and most widely received works in theoretical evolutionary biology of the 20th century.

The influence of Richard Dawkins is somewhat paradoxical - on the one hand, he is the most ardent and public defender of a pretty much gene-exclusive view of evolution, arguing fervently against multi-level selection and anything that smells of it. At the same time, his own idea of memetics inspired many other researched to further discover and develop non-genetic means of inheritance and their influence on trait-distributions in populations, and his ideas about the extended phenotype also inspired many to investigate the dimensions of expression of inherited traits, especially *non-anatomical ones*.

In the 80s, researchers like Boyd &amp; Richerson developed Gene-Culture Coevolution theory, developing mathematical models for the spread and modification of behavioral and cognitive traits, while others (like Michael Tomasello) did extensive ethological research into the cultural origins of cognition.

The 90s gave birth to Niche-Construction theory - the seminal work being subtitled ""The neglected process in evolution"" - approaching a theory of how the evolution of a population (what traits are expressed in which distributions and how these change) is influenced by the ways individuals modify their effective *Umwelt* heritable, for example by modifying the chemical composition of the soil, or maintaining and improving buildings (like ant- or termite-hills) inherited over generations - since such things directly and significantly change the shape of selection-pressures on a population.

Also starting in the 90s, we discovered epigenetics in the form of acquired cytosine-methylation patterns, chromatin and cellular template construction, allow inheritance of acquired traits stably and short-term adaptively over multiple generations.

Together with our pre-existing knowledge of non-genetic inheritance of acquired behavioral and cognitive traits, this was a exceptionally well documented case of inheritance of acquired traits - and thus partial ""rehabilitation"" of Lamarckian ideas. The Weismann doctrine that all information you can pass is the one you inherit at birth turned out to be more of a dogma than a law of nature.

One of the researchers most deeply involved in the discoveries of epigenetics (and non-genetic inheritance and selection in general) is Eva Jablonka, who also published a widely cited paper, documenting and cataloging about 100 empirical different cases of trans-generational epigenetic inheritance.

She was also the main author of the very insightful and excellent ""science also readable for laypeople"" book *Evolution in Four Dimensions*, where she does a great job explaining the genetic, epigenetic, behavioral and cultural dimensions of evolution.

In the last 1 1/2 decades, many have further broadened the spectrum and wealth of evolutionary theory. We now have to synthesize the insights of Evo-Devo, Developmental  Systems Theory, various elaborations on conceptions of Fitness, Niche-Construction, Epigenetics, social and cultural inheritance.

The mutual partial determination between culture and genes is rather easy to see if you understand the following ideas: Selection pressures in the real world are faced by whole individuals, who present a certain total phenotype, determined by all the information inherited across all channels of transmission for information leading to the generation of phenotypic traits. 

The various channels of transmission have different temporal frames for adaptation (and drift) - genetic is ""slowest"" to have population-wide effects, while epigenetics is somewhat quicker, with epigenetic information adapting within one genetic generation. Cultural inheritance is sometimes slower, sometimes faster - it can change significantly within one genetic generation, but its dynamics are mostly on a somewhat larger scale. Inheritance through social learning is the fastest - many variations can be generation within a single genetic generation, both randomly and non-randomly, can be modified and adapted multiple times within a single lifetime, and will spread (like cultural inheritance) both horizontally and vertically. 

Factors such as prestige-biased emulation and imitation learning  (we are more prone to imitate socially prestigious individuals) strongly shape the dynamics of social learning, and thus the behavioral and cognitive traits and their distributions individuals express.

What does all this mean for the interplay between genes and culture? Genes provide the anatomy necessary to even be able to inherit and modify information in that way, and also have some influence on more direct cognitive and emotional properties of individuals. Since social and cultural learning is constituted by individual behavior driven by cognition and emotion, the partially determinative link from genes to culture is established.

How about the way ""back down""? Simple - socially and culturally acquired traits are the main determining factors for both mate-choice and child-rearing strategies - and these naturally determine the genetic makeup of the lineages ""down the road"". What's more, they strongly determine cultural niche-construction - the things we build to alleviate and alter selection pressures, like houses, roads, doctors, political institutions - which affect among other things how ""safe"" or ""dangerous"" life is for which kinds of individuals with which traits - again strongly influencing which strategies and individuals can survive and procreate successfully... both adaptively and maladaptively.

Alright - I think that's about the gist of it. On towards the references.

Let's start with the piece in Nature - here it is: [A discussion pro and contra an ""Extended Evolutionary Synthesis"".](http://www.nature.com/news/does-evolutionary-theory-need-a-rethink-1.16080?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20141009#noalliswell) Most important is what even the detractors have to say about the ""pro""-side:

&gt;they contend that four phenomena are important evolutionary processes: phenotypic plasticity, niche construction, inclusive inheritance and developmental bias. We could not agree more. We study them ourselves.

The detractors argue that where these things occur, they are of course important factors in evolution, but since they don't occur in all populations (they are dependent on the major transitions), they aren't ""fundamental"" for evolution itself, and our current conceptions are able to account for these factors sufficiently.

The pro-side is arguing (more convincingly I think) that all the knowledge we acquired about different units, channels, levels and mechanisms of inheritance and selection, all the things that together determine which traits are present in which distributions in populations and how they change... all this new knowledge paints a picture so radically different from a gene-exclusive view of evolution and from the previous assumptions (see Weismann-doctrine) that paradigm shifts are warranted.

The takeaway: even the detractors in this nature piece do not contest the existence and evolutionary significance of those multi-level phenomena in the lineages where they occur.

The issue of units and levels of selection has drawn considerable analytical attention. A widely respected seminal work is Samir Okasha's [*""Evolution and the Levels of Selection""*](https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=samir+okasha+Units+and+levels+of+selection&amp;hl=de&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4QgQMwAGoVChMIx422_IvUxwIVR5QsCh2WvgHC)

As the nature-piece shows - this thinking is slowly becoming mainstream - though there is disagreement about whether we need paradigm shifts for accomodating the insights.

I hope this has been informative.

Spiegel says:

And it wasn't a try to take over the stands but more a 'how dare those effeminate little fucks telling us what flags we are allowed to fly'.

Fun fact: Dissidenti and the group in question are now standing in the same sector.

&gt; Dovresti saperne di memetica per capire che bisognerebbe stare attenti a ciò che ci viene proposto (il malvagio attivista SJW che vuole rendere tutti gli uomini schiavi) e chiedersi se sposiamo certe posizioni (es: gamergate) effettivamente per logica o perchè siamo predisposti naturalmente a credere a qualcosa (un maschio bianco che non ha mai fatto esperienza di ""privilegi"" è vulnerabile a cazzate riguardanti malvagi gruppi che lo accusano di essere un privilegiato).

Stai accusando una mancanza di memeismo che porta ad una sorta di complottismo. L'accusa di complottismo è SJW 101, quindi forse sei tu che hai certe tendenze, e per questo mi preoccupi. Qua non c'è una tendeza a credere un bel niente, c'è una capacità di constatare la realtà. Ho portato esempi concreti come Dawkings etichettato come razzista e peggio... forse sei tu che non segui molto visto che ha anche intimato una querela. Sei tu che in testa hai una immagine fittizia di una specie di contro-patriarcato egualmente assurdo. 

Poi associ Kia con tumblrinaction as anti-sjw che sono due cose completamente diverse, non so cosa centri TIA che è un sub satirico. Questi attivisti sono i nuovi creazionisti e TIA li celebra nello stesso identico modo. Dopo l'apparizione gli atheits+ quel sub pulula di new atheists, ancora una volta, mi sa che non ti sei reso conto del vento che è cambiato, e devi fare un nuovo edit al post. Neo-Femminism is the new joke in town.

E con gamergate stai facendo il superiore quando invece fai la figura di quello che chiaramente non sa di cosa sta parlando e pappagalla cose sentite in giro, zero scietticismo. Vittima di supponenza o del giornalismo andato a ramengo, poco importa, manchi delle basi per una discussione a riguardo. 
Mi sono reso conto dell livello immeso di palle che vengono dette in giro e di come gli sjw usino in maniera metodologica la diffamazione come strumento per zittire l'opposizone, quindi puoi pure dirmi che i redpill, che non ho mai visitato, sono nazisti e do per scontato che non sia vero senza aver prima verificato.

I cannot answer you in detail right now, but it seems to me you are mixing concepts, mainly multi-level selection and the nature vs nurture debate.

I guess one could argue that epigenetics could, in one or two generations, have an impact in behaviour to say the most. But to extrapolate that to a kind of selection of culture would be a stretch.

Les acteurs hommes sont souvent peu considérés, pour ne pas dire que les consommateurs de porno (hétéro) se foutent complètement d'eux.

&gt; Due to bad connection/equipment and the generally chaotic situation 7 days late: on june 16th, 2 days before the loss of our beloved friend and comrade Mazlum Aktaş, our unit took part in several operations to liberate the villages between the just liberated city of Sülük and the city of Tel Abiyad. Together with forces of YPG/YPJ, we finally entered Tel Abiyad and were happily welcomed by big parts of the population that was still around. The forces of Daesh mainly fled from the attack by crossing the border to Turkey at the other end of the town, together with civilian refugees and not stopped by the Turkish soldiers who where monitoring the whole thing without doing anything but posing with their weapons and making insulting gestures towards us. 
**The picture shows members of our unit, anarchist and communist comrades from Europe, at the end of the day, on our way back through Sülük, from where we are still making our way south, driving Daesh into the desert with our Kurdish comrades.**

- L'enfouissement profond dans des zones géologiquement stables est peu risqué et raisonnablement peu cher. Il est déjà au point pour les déchets militaires aux US, sauf que la plupart est classé secret défense et ils ne veulent pas mélanger les déchets civils et militaires. Et les gens du civil ont moins envie de payer et ont plus les écolos sur le dos.

- Le danger des radiations est massivement sur médiatisé, surtout leur rayon d'effet. Les trucs vraiment mortels ont quelques dizaines de mètres de portée à tout casser. Tout le monde se fout d'une légère augmentation du cancer dans une société post apocalyptique. Je ne sais pas si ça te parle quand je dis ""l'hypothèse linéaire sans seuil"", en gros, il n'y a pas du tout d'apparition de cancer pour les doses moyennes de radioactivité car notre corps est équipé pour gérer cela. 99.9% de la zone évacuée de Chernobyl est au dessous du seuil d'apparition d'une augmentation de cancers. 99.9% de la zone de Fukushima n'a JAMAIS dépassé ce seuil. Le seuil d'évacuation est ridiculement faible et est principalement fait pour éviter qu'on critique les gouvernements, si on était moins cons, 5000 personnes à tout casser auraient été évacuées à Fukushima.

Les estimation élevées de l'ONU pour les morts de Chernobyl utilisent l'hypothèse linéaire sans seuil (que l'on sait fausse depuis 50 ans, mais personne ne veut changer pour ne pas attirer les écolos emmerdeurs) et parlent de 10000 morts. Avec les modèles actuels, les estimations seraient plus de quelques centaines à un millier de morts à tout casser, principalement parmi les nettoyeurs et les enfants de Pripyat. Et c'est principalement du au fait qu'ils ont été pris par surprise et n'ont pas eu le temps de distribuer de pastilles d'iode. Bref, la menace d'accidents nucléaire est massivement surévaluée par la bêtise des écolos. Pour rappel, 0 cancer imputable à la radioactivité pour l'accident de Fukushima, un mort qui s'est pris une poutre sur la tête pendant l’inondation lors du tsunami (30000 morts causé par le tsunami dans le pays, 5x plus coût de reconstruction que le coût de gestion sur le long terme de la centrale de Fukushima).

- Les réacteurs de prochaine génération peuvent manger une bonne partie des déchets, ce qui fait d'ailleurs qu'il ne faut pas pour l'instant faire de stockage définitif puisque dans 20 ans on va vouloir utiliser ces déchets.

- Les progrès en physique font qu'il devient de plus en plus imaginable de transmuter la plupart les déchets de long terme en déchets de court terme, rendant inutile l'enfouissement des déchets.",null,0,null,1441053838,null,null,1441054281,0,cum8pot,null,t3_3ixkdb,null,null,null,t1_cum5t6f,null,null,null,1441613149,null,1,null,france,t5_2qhjz,1,null

Whether talking about dictators we've supported or opposed, put in power or dethroned, these type of extremists always follow in their wake. From Iran, to Iraq, to Syria. When you oppress a population politically &amp; socially, and make it so their only real means of opposition is through religious groups, than yes, of course, you're going to get extremists because that becomes the people's only real legitimate &amp; permitted social outlet *(nor can you exactly try &amp; squash out religion itself, as that tends to backfire in much the same way, as evidenced by the Soviets &amp; Afghanistan)*. 

Egypt is the perfect example of this. When we supported Egypt under Mubarak because of the Suez Canal &amp; peace with Israel, we were condemned by everyone for propping up a authoritarian dictator. When we opposed Sissi because the Muslim Brotherhood had won the election democratically &amp; peacefully, we were condemned by everyone for supporting religious extremists. When Russia went &amp; made overtures to Sissi is regards to the above, Putin was called a master chessplayer who's wisdom knows no bounds. When we reacted by laying off Sisi &amp; unfreezing that aid money so as to off-set that growing Russian influence, we were condemned as bastard dog imperialists propping up a authoritarian dictator.

No matter what we do, we're in the wrong. The public, and reddit, doesn't even know what they fuck they want, or truly oppose, for the matter as well.

And, just for the record, when we left Iraq, Al-Qaeda &amp; groups like it had been either successfully suppressed &amp; widdled down to nuisance groups, thrown out or systematically destroyed. It's not a coincidence that ISIS had to infiltrate &amp; attack from Syria, instead of the opposite. 

I do find it odd that no blame is placed on Iran &amp; Maliki as well by your implications. The Iranian-backed militias who supported Maliki single-handily burned every fucking bridge we forged &amp; alliance we made with the Sunni Awakening after the Troop Surge. And not only that, he also managed to fuck up every relationship the country had with surrounding Sunni countries while doing everything in his power to make sure it was untenable for us to maintain a presence. 

But no, personally fueling sectarian warfare in your own country at the behest of a foreign one, betraying the Sunni tribes which helped you push these type of extremists out, pissing over every one of your Sunni neighbors, while letting your Shia neighbor train &amp; arm Shia militias in your own country, and not to mention moving to kick out the one country which had made stability after Saddam's fall possible was a *great course of action* that puts no huge amount of fault on Maliki &amp; Iran's shoulders what-so-ever.

If we all want to keep livable cities, then those refugees will have to be dispersed at first. The easiest way to do that is to place a few of them in each EU country.

Someone who makes it through the procedure and qualifies as a refugee will eventually get the same rights as every other citizen of an EU nation.

Uhuh. 

I hope the American military industrial complex (general electric was working on it I believe) builds a fusion reactor, if anyone has the resources, manpower and potential to get it done during our lifetimes it will be them. If a fusion reactor ever gets built I doubt it will be ITER, ITER is a way to funnel money to construction companies and corrupt politicians and a good foundation for the belief that ""fusion is always 30 years in the future"". 

Edit: For the one downvoting me, straight from the wikipedia page:

&gt;Launched in 1985,[25] the ITER project was formally agreed to and funded in 2006 with a cost estimate of €10 billion ($12.8 billion) projecting the start of construction in 2008 and completion a decade later.[12]

&gt; However, as of 2013, the project has run into many delays and budget overruns.

I'm going to assume these numbers are made up unless you cite them. Either way, they prove nothing. Could be simply that more people with a proper reason to flee apply in Sweden than Hungary.

&gt; When illegal immigrants come to Germany, they have absolutely free movement and they are sent to camp and treated like lords, given money and everything.

First of all, asylum seekers are by definition not illegal immigrants. Making use of the universal human right of asylum is not illegal in any way. Furthermore, no, asylum seekers get nothing of that sort. They are housed in aslyum seeker centres from which they must not go away too far and get, at best, a small amount of money, way below the minimum sum that regular users of social security get.

&gt; When they illegaly enter Czechia, they are handcuffed and sent to a detention behind 4 meters tall fence, their personal stuff including phones is removed from them and they have to pay for the accomodation.

They are not illegally entering if they are asylum seekers. Czechia would lose in court if it came to that. If anything the Czech Republic can send them back to the first EU country they entered which is obligated under current EU rules to deal with them.

&gt; There are enourmous differences between asylum politics of countries and it's fault of western countries that they have such benevolent policy that the whole world comes to them.

Yes, some are living up to their obligations and some are not.

It would almost be funny if it weren't so sad. So many people from the Eastern Bloc sought refuge in the West during the cold war and now that another part of the world is in trouble and its people are seeking refuge, that same part of Europe is turning its back.

Let me tell you a few things about the two mayor fiscal transfer things we currently have in Germany.

On one  hand there is the so called ""Länderfinanzausgleich"" (Fiscal transfer between federal states). Richer countries give some of their taxes into a pool, from which the poorer countries will get money as a compensation.

Currently this looks like [this.](http://www.br.de/nachrichten/2014-laenderfinanzausgleich-vergleich-100.png?version=f3aff)

Then there is another kind of fiscal transfer, which started with the reunification.
Basically there is an additional percentage on top of your income taxes, that is used to ""rebuild"" our new federal states. The so called ""Solidaritätszuschlag"" (solidarity tax).
The eastern federal states can use the money as they seem fit.

Now, I never questioned that it's a good thing to pool some money from everyone, to get it where it is needed.
What bothers me though, is the geographical criteria of distribution.

In my opinion we should distribute this money on a municipality level. This way the poorest municipalities would get support.
I think people are more likely to accept a fiscal transfer, if they get the feeling that ""this poor village next to us, where the last big employer just closed down"" has the same chance of benefitting, as the city on the other end of the continent.

null,null,TheFairyGuineaPig,null,null,null,"Within the British government, legal aid is being destroyed. It *must* be given more funding along with the lawyers involved. Legal aid is necessary but the cuts mean the system is failing too many asylum seekers.

Having more immigration training for helpline staff. Currently, to give immigration advice, you *must* be accredited. It's not difficult to do, but far too few places offer it in the UK. I'd say with the increase in refugees, asylum seekers and other immigrants, the British government should make it a priority to ensure those working on the helplines for eg financial advice are accredited and they should give loans or support to charities and helplines needing staff to be accredited. It is so simple, it's a short and simple course, but it can change lives. There should be a specialist immigration advice helpline with immigration specialists who the other helpline staff can refer callers to, but I believe the helpline staff should be able to give very basic advice as well before referring them over. 

Adult education and apprenticeships. I believe any and every person granted asylum should have access to English language education and adult education at the local adult education centres, with perhaps student loans or funding going towards apprenticeships and further education. This integrates people into society long term to allow them to benefit society.

Support women's rights charities and immigration charities for things you can do on an individual level. I volunteer at a women's rights charity and most of the people we deal with are actually immigrants (although usually not asylum seekers, rather coming over on  by marriage visa etc). This is partly to do with the area we're in, but in times of high stress and trauma, levels of domestic violence and abuse, marriage difficulties and gender based violence increase dramatically and will have massive effects on the families of immigrants. A woman in a financially abusive situation will find it harder to integrate into society for example. The vast majority of immigrants are of course not in that situation or needing the support of the charity, but the vast majority of those needing help are immigrants at the particular charity I volunteer with, at least. 

Also, good social welfare systems *in general*. A family granted asylum moving into a shitty area with high crime rates, high rates of drug use, abuse and poverty with a school which is comparatively poor and in area of high unemployment and little hope for the future is almsot certain to do worse than a family granted asylum in an area with good local projects run by the council to involve people in the community, low crime rates and no gangs, good education so the children or young adults can get on in life better, in an area with less poverty and hope so people are less likely to become hopeless, disenfranchised or even (in extreme cases) radicalised, with access to services such as libraries to facilitate English learning and integration etc etc. a person, born and raised in the country, is likely to do better.

* Somewhat similarly the citizens of Poznań are considered to be very frugal. 
* People living in Kielce are called pocket knives. No one really knows where the name came from, but one popular interpretation attributes it to their short temper and corresponding penchant for brawls, possibly involving sharp objects.
* *Górale* (Highlanders) - greedy, would do and sell you anything for money. Very religious. The highest concentration of them can be found in Chicago.
* *Zagłębiacy* or the habitants of the Dąbrowa Basin - the embodiment of everything that is wrong with the human race, at least according to Upper Silesians. The region is sometimes referred to using the qualifier red, because a significant number of Communist Party members originated from there during the previous regime.
* *Słoiki* or jars - people from outside Warsaw who came there looking for work.

In the US, we know which are the low performing and which are the high performing economically.  It is very rare for California to call out Mississippi on how it spends its money.

Counter-intuitively, its actually the lower performing states that are typically calling for more money from the federal government even though they receive a disproportionately high amount per capita already.

&gt; There is no way in hell the EU will federalize the cost of a public service or benefit without also federalizing the conditions of access to the benefit or the way this public service works. 

Again using the model of federalism we have in the USA, States are granted certain sums for public works based on the population of that State.  For many services, it is up to that State to determine how the money is spent.  Some choose to pay out lower benefits for services, while other States choose to raise taxes to provide more money to the services over and above the grant from the federal government.

This does lead to some inequality, but the lower performing states are much better off than they would be on their own, and higher performing state still have a sense of community with lower performing states without very much bitterness.  We believe we are all better off together.

Ora, se non capisci che quel ""celebra"" era ironico, soprattutto dopo aver associato i sjw ai creazionisti e dopo aver parlato di ateismo per dieci commenti, mi sa che è la tua capacità di comprendere che ha problemi, non la mia. Comincio a farmi una idea di chi ho davanti.

Ha ha Sad Puppies, chissà come minchia è stato scritto l'articolo che hai letto, ho il sospetto che tu abbia recepito una storia diversa dalla realtà, come per gamergate. Sad puppies, rabid puppies tutto mischiato assiame, aggiungere nazismo e cis white man quanto basta. Ora mi è abbastanza chiaro tutto, sei ancora nella fase in cui credi ai media ""progressisti"", per favore dimmi che hai come fonte Arthur (it ends tonight) Chu . Provo tenerezza, non è colpa tua, non vedi sjw perchè ancora non li riconosci. I Sad Puppies non mi interessano proprio, non ho seguito i fatti e non entro nemmeno nella discussione, ho visto solo una serie di palle raccontate. Se vuoi parlami di gamergate  visto che lo sto studiando da mesi e posso dirti tutte le vaccate che probabilmetne credi di sapere. 

Poi non so cosa centri il concentramento o l'accentramento di un gruppo con la discussione, anti-sjw resta comunque una fazione estremamente eterogenea.

Ripeto, ho portato esempi lampanti come quelli di Dawkings e Maher, insisti con il parlare di uno fantomatico strawmen che è solo nella tua testa, perchè è probabilmente la tiritera che ti hanno ripetuto. Gli sjw esistono e sono tra noi. Non percepisci o ignori quello che sta succedendo e pensi che sia tutto inventato... ma certo è la sintassi il problema.

The South East- snooty, stuck up, middle class people living in suburbia, commuting into London, well off.

Essex- stupid people who are bright orange, overdo the make up and look crazy, like going to nightclubs, mainly towns.

Norfolk (on the East coast)- inbred people with weird accents and webbed feet. They're kind of crazy and odd and like incest.

Yorkshire- funny but nice accents, have flat cap, like whippets, are very thrifty, like a good drink at t'pub (they shorten the to t'), blunt and tells it like it is, enjoys a good brass band.

The North- poor, less stuck up than southerners somewhat but considers themselves harder and better than southerners. A bit uncouth and un cultured. Loads of ex mining towns. Very friendly and likes to chat. Calls everyine 'love' or 'hen' often.

The Midlands (middle of England)- strange and horrible accents, urban, grey, poor, depressing.

Wales- they fuck sheep. They like singing. They hate the English.

North Wales- thinks their Welsh is the proper welsh language. Speaks welsh all the time. 

Swansea, Newport and Cardiff (South of Wales)- poor, shitty areas. The people there don't fuck sheep as much because it's harder to find sheep. They don't speak welsh at all.

East Wales- they like weird meatballs called faggots (btw until you've had a Monmouthshire faggot, you haven't lived, they're these awesome offal meatball type things, ignore the name) and are practically English. The welsh language spoken there is inferior to the welsh spoken in North Wales. It rains a lot.

Scotland- they like eating strange and disgusting food like haggis. They hunt haggis for sport and have nearly endangered the species. They're friendly and talk to people all the time. They get drunk often and like a strange orange drink called irn Bru made out of iron girders from the biggest bridge in Scotland. They hate the English.

Aberdonians (from Aberdeen, a city in Scotland)- they fuck sheep.

Glaswegians (from Glasgow, the biggest city in Scotland)- they are friendly, drunk and like to stab people. There's a thing called the Glasgow smile (look it up, it's funny in a bad way). They are Proper Scots not like those nasty Edinburgh people. They have accents no one understands and have massive football rivalries and some minor sectarianism.

Edinburgh- posh. They're basically English Scots. They're rich and hate the English the least.

The Tunisian revolt was pretty legitimate. Ben Ali was as corrupt as can be. Literally just there to fill his pockets as fast as possible. Fuck him.     
Assad had some half decent relations with the west &amp; was going for a peace treaty with Israël in cooperation with Turkey and the US. The later might condemn him vigorously now but it made no sense for them to take him down. As far as I'm concerned it was another domino in the Arab spring. Both him and Mubarak were scuffling with the Muslim Brotherhood which were no real friends of the US nor its allies (SA, Isreal, etc) &amp; el-Sisi is no better for them either. Not being confrontational but did increase relations with Russia. Qaddafi used to be an enemy but improved relations drastically though he kept throwing anti-western rethoric around.

Gros pavé, surtout pour moi qui n'avais plus l'habitude de lire mais c'est pas mal, ça retrace l'histoire de la Bastille, de sa construction comme forteresse-réserve d'or à sa chute, avec tout le fonctionnement de la Justice de l'époque, la vie quotidienne à la Bastille, les grandes affaires qui ont marqué l'époque ainsi la légende qui a été créée autour.

Drôle d'époque, y'a des passages très déprimants, d'autres totalement barrés (genre le marquis de Sade enfermé pour ses écrits érotiques qui se fait livré encre et papier pour en écrire, les prisonniers qui font leur liste de courses, le mec fou dans sa cellule qui harangue une procession religieuse qui se bat avec la police qui tente de les disperser et où plusieurs policiers sont tabassés à coups de cierges / chandeliers, les gardes autrichiens tellement mal habillés qu'on les prend pour des prisonniers le jour de la prise de la Bastille, etc)

I had a friend who migrated from Australia to Germany and she had to re-attend some classes because her medical qualification wasn't fully accepted here! She didn't had to start all over again but it still took some time. Now she has a german and a australian medical degree.

Should you wish to (and have the time to) take this up again later, here are my thoughts on your response:

&gt;mainly multi-level selection and the nature vs nurture debate.

Hmm... could you point out where? In the literature I cited and its associated research-programs, the issue rather specifically framed by the authors in terms of inheritance and selection as part of evolutionary theory - be it Niche-Construction Theory, Epigenetics, Social or Cultural Inheritance, Developmental Systems Theory or other mentioned approaches. 

Certainly, this bears on the ""nature""-""nurture"" debate strongly - but that's not a confusion, it's about how we get the traits we have, and what is inherited (passed along with some stability across generations) in which ways.... it's about the units and levels of inheritance and selection.

The secondary literature also discusses these approaches and studies as concerning inheritance and selection.

&gt;I am not familiar with any strong evidence for multi-level selection presently.

See above - and the literature I provided in the previous comments, these are all at heart about inheritance and selection. 

There is multi-level selection whenever there are phenotypic traits inherited through more than one channel that affect how individual's face selection-pressures.... necessarily, since individuals face selection-pressures as wholes (i.e. with all the traits they have). 

Also because traits that affect for example foraging, mate-choice &amp; child-rearing strategies will necessarily affect the distribution of alleles in populations - and where such strategies are heritable, they can be (and are being) differentially selected, for those reasons.

To maintain that there is no multi-level selection would mean having to argue that either no traits can be inherited with significant fidelity except genetically (obviously false given ""inclusive inheritance"", as the authors in the *Nature*-piece term it in acknowledging its role), or that no such traits could have systematic bearing on fitness and thus be selectable (also obviously false, since things like foraging-, mate-choice and offspring-rearing strategies are both heritable and fitness-relevant), or that no variations for such traits could be generated (also false)... or a combination of the above.

I don't see how either claim could be maintained in light of the evidence. 

As such - all of epigenetics is part of ""multi-level selection"", so is all trans-generational inheritance of behavioral strategies via social learning, all differential persistence and proliferation of traits inherited through niche-construction, including cultural niche-construction.

While there is of course much still to learn, we have a good grasp on both epigenetics and social inheritance, including mathematical models for the distributions of traits and the dynamics thereof.

The only criteria necessary for evolution are variation, inheritance and differential ecological success. The mentioned facts show that those are most certainly met by all kinds of fitness-relevant traits we have, both anatomical, cognitive, emotional, behavioral - as well as all properties of the more widely extended phenotype, like beaver-dams, anthills, houses and technology in general. Many such traits are well known to be passed on between individuals (horizontally and vertically) through different channels of inheritance.

&gt;I guess one could argue that epigenetics could, in one or two generations, have an impact in behaviour to say the most.

Actually, the most widely cited studies are about changes during the lifetime of one generation having direct effect on the next, for short- to medium-term adaptation. See the Jablonka-paper for a wealth of empirical case-studies.

&gt;But to extrapolate that to a kind of selection of culture would be a stretch.

It's not an extrapolation on the consequences of cytosine-methylation or other cellular epigenetics - it's the fact that inheritance of selectable traits takes place through more than one channel, all interacting to produce the fitness-relevant traits of the individual, who then differentially spreads those traits (along the various inheritance channels).

The channels are genetics, cellular epigenetics, social learning and niche-construction (including culture), not just genetics alone.

We also have to be quite precise when talking about ""selection of culture""... there are multiple ways to understand this. On the one hand, there is selection of socially and culturally inherited behavioral traits - whenever learnable strategies face up against selection pressures and confer differential success.

On the other, there are ""cultures"" as a whole, i.e. the cultural artifacts and behavior of entire populations, and whether these, between different populations, are selected against.

This matter is more complicated, but there is still ample evidence in human history that certain population-wide cultural phenomena are conductive to the persistence and growth of the populations, and to their own spread to other cultures (certain metallurgy-practices are a rather well-studied example).

&gt;Again, even without venturing into the sociology domain, there is no hard evidence for group selection.

That is certainly true for the earliest discussed models, which required quite specific migration-dynamics to work, where such dynamics are unlikely to occur with any significant frequency in nature - but those models of group-selection did not account for inclusive inheritance.

The more recent models pay attention to the various inheritance-channels and the dynamics of distributions for traits inherited through them. 

Here again, we have to distinguish between the issue of the dynamics of distributions of culturally inherited traits within a population, and whether these are subject to drift and selection (they are, not least because all technology can be better or worse at whatever it is trying to do - and is inherited and modified... we don't start new every generation, and we modify what we found)... 
and the issue of whether the size relative persistance and size of populations is affected by group-level traits, which is a more critical issue concerning the empirical evidence we have.

On a theoretical level, though, this too is absolutely sound: Imagine two somewhat separated populations of bonobos who nevertheless share roughly the same ecological situation. Now in one of them, there is a discovery of simple tool-manufacturing that is passed on parentally and alloparentally. The new tool allows them to extract more resources more efficiently from the same environment, and thus contributes to stability and growth. If the other population has nothing to compensate, they will not be able to sustain a similar increase in population size. If some strategy heritable through social learning becomes survival-critical for ecological reasons, lineages and populations where it is not present may even become extinct.

This is not fringe or outlandish in every way - and since it concerns heritable traits affecting fitness and thus the persistence of lineages non-randomly, i.e. selection of heritable traits - it's about evolution.

Summary judgements about group selection are no longer warranted given what we now understand about the units and levels of inheritance and selection. Certain models are garbage, others are plausible but not sufficiently studied. With the appreciation of inclusive inheritance and phenotypic plasticity as processes in evolution, the theoretical foundations are sound, but the details are certainly contentious.

EDIT: In any case, another important example is the current state of knowledge about the evolutionary history of *homo neanderthaliensis* and *homo sapiens*. We know that Neandertal populations were getting smaller and becoming integrated into larger sapiens populations, leading to the current situation where neandertal traits (genetic and phenotypic) are part of, but a rather small part of - our *homo sapiens sapiens* lineage. And we know that the tools homo sapiens used at that time to enable better foraging were mostly not present in neandertal populations, who are generally recognized to have had less efficient foraging systems, contributing to their shrinking and merging of their populations into mainly-sapiens populations. 

Such dynamics are exactly what current theories of group-selection model, and the fact that the above is part of the current account for the evolutionary paths of *homo sapiens* and *homo neanderthaliensis* shows that we have hard evidence for such dynamics taking place, though how we should model such phenomena exactly remains contentious. But as mentioned, multi-level selection goes far beyond any of the specific proposed phenomena termed ""group selection"" I distinguished above and includes all of genetics, epigenetics and other dimensions of inheritance and selection.",null,0,null,1441058876,null,null,1441060705,0,cumbx4r,null,t3_3j0p0n,null,null,null,t1_cum8gbp,null,null,null,1441614724,null,2,null,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

It'll take around a decade for this first fusion plant to be operational (or not) and at least another decade after that (if it is successful) to expand it around Europe and the world to quench our electricity needs. On the otherhand, if we directed all of the government subsidies which are being directed towards nuclear research and for the construction of nuclear power plants (which includes unofficial subsidies, such as that used to build Hinckley Point in the UK) towards renewables, then we would likely be running almost completely on renewables even before nuclear fusion reactors would have fulfilled that role. 

Aside from the issue of speed of implementation (which is extremely important given that the first signs of global climate change are already upon us), there's also many other benefits that pure renewables (such as hydro, geothermal, wind and solar) have over nuclear energy:

1)  most importantly that there is essentially zero risk associated with renewables. Nuclear power stations will always have the potential to cause wide ranging nuclear catastrophes, such as happened in Fukushima and Chernobyl. The safety precautions which have been implemented over time are indeed impressive and I'll concede that contamination from any particular European plant in the next five years is unlikely, there is however always the potential and unforeseen events will can always happen. **It's the difference between using a live fire in your bedroom (with a great deal of safety measures) or a radiator which costs the same over the long term. One of them has a small chance of destroying my house and my family with it, whilst the other has a zero percent change.** I'll say again that the safety measures in place at modern European nuclear reactors are impressive, but I can't help but think that the safety precautions in place at Fukushima and Chernobyl were also impressive at the time, and only with hindsight can we clearly see the problems. 

2) **Renewables** can be more evenly distributed so that electricity is created closer to where it is consumed, leading to **less electricity being lost in transmission** (as opposed to a handful of nuclear reactors spread across an entire country). 

3) **Renewables have greater potential** than nuclear. Developments, especially in solar technology, have the potential to aid the introduction of **electric cars and therefore limit our dependence on petrol, and therefore limit petrol's impact on our environment**. Nuclear power has no such potential, unless you want to start adding mini-reactors to cars, in which case I direct you to point #1. But renewables also have wider potential for use in **developing countries**, which lack the infrastructure to build nuclear power plants. 

4) **Nuclear power's association with nuclear weapons will always be a problem**. Yes, in theory there need not be a connection between the two. However, it's happened too many times in the past that the infrastructure which was created explicitly for the use of nuclear power plants has aided the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 

5) **The issue of nuclear waste** has still not been adequately solved. ",null,0,null,1441059448,null,null,false,0,cumca4j,null,t3_3j419j,null,null,null,t1_cum9ekm,null,null,null,1441614895,null,-15,null,europe,t5_2qh4j,-15,null

Privacy: That surveillance apparatus will exist regardless, and it needs to in order to protect entire countries from terrorist or chaotic threats. Privacy is a necessary sacrifice to combat impossible dangers and terrorists. 

Journalism: Removing all public/government journalist outlets will do more harm than good. For every ""RT"" you purge, you're also purging a local news story, or an ""NPR"". Objectivity, and certainly not neutrality, is not possible for any person, much less an appointing board-----and it will be a very short amount of time before those entities become corrupted, in one way or another. 

Immigration: This will never work, to be blunt. More European countries should follow America's model of assimilation over integration, and keeping illegals that contribute to society, and deporting those that don't. The path to citizenship should be achievable, but not handed out to anyone who enters your land. 

Communication: Kind of agree. While I agree that english should be the base language, I am all for the corruption and hybridization of existing languages, so long as it's a natural (not government involved) process. Hybridizing aspects of French and English, Arabic and English, or Spanglish (Spanish and English). Having a second (non-english) language should be something to take pride in(even if you don't use it in day to day life), not shamed away. 

Illness and health: Holism and other counter cultural mindsets are a plague in the medical field, your suggestions would to irreversible harm to existing medical practices and researches. 

Changing world: You seem to glorify the idea of independent entities managing this stuff. All of this will very quickly implode in on itself, until it resembles our current mess. In any case, we don't need a continental or global model dictating what field of research we can or cannot look into. Science is not the servant of some faux-totalitarian party/technocracy. 

Banks: Society and people work best when consumers and public exist somewhere in between a symbiotic and dependent relationship relationship with the business they're dealing with, this includes banks. Limiting their power and influence will cause 99% more problems than solutions. It's better to work within the system for reform instead of trying to rebuild it as some outsider. 

Corporations: Absolutely disagree. Less restrictions, absolutely TTIP, yes to all types of lobbying, and no ""independent group"" or extended monitoring. The simple truth is governments and societies need to be guided in the right directions be economic powerhouses, whose very existence is based on managing their profits. Corporatism is an objectively good derivation of capitalism, and a preferable alternative to non-corporate influenced socialism. 

Politicians: Again with the independent groups. These will be the first to fall to bias, incompetence, corruption, or all three. These groups won't solve anything, and politicians will always be manipulated by money. You can't reinvent the wheel here. 

Automatisation: Your obsession with punishing and antagonizing corporations will kill your fictional party from within. It borders on zealotry. 

Global Warming/environment: Agree, as long as this research includes existing fuels like oil, nuclear, etc. Focusing on only the stereotypical ""alternate energies"" will cripple whatever research you want to start up. 

European Economic and Geopolitic Competitiveness: This is infinitely easier said than done, but I admire your ambition. I would caution you to remember that consumers from America, China, Russia, etc will want your products one way or the other, so some form of commercial trade has to be authorized. Isolationism had been a failed ideology for the past 115 years. 

European Army: Absolutely, so long as they work with NATO, rather than intending to replace them. We need as much buffer zones in Western Europe as possible, and America's military influence in your continent is for your benefit. We aren't Russia or China------we have been your ally for decades. 

Freedom of religion: Nope, nope, nope, and nope. Freedom of religion and the extroverted culture of pretty much everything in my country (including religion) go hand and hand. Half of the things I and people I know celebrate would be considered ""destructive"" by your definition. Europeans are more introverted and less social about religion in general-----but this choice will ruin everything very quickly. 

Law: Laws are meant to be disregarded if they're stupid, not practical, or unpopular. Completely disagree, judges, courts, whatever legal proceedings there are need to have more options and freedom to be bias, not less. My philosophy with the law and enforcement of the more or less boils down to ""just wing it and see what happens"". 


Remove kingdoms across Europe: Why? As long as the monarchy isn't a threat to Europe, it won't be any more or less an issue than other Republics. As long as a monarchy isn't actively making the lives of Europeans hell, it shouldn't be an issue. 

Switzerland: Crime will always exist. It's only fitting people find ways to profit off it it. Completely disagree. 

Africa: Agree, as long as it's done competently. 

Asia: That's our territory. We've been the ones building relationships with Asian countries for the past multiple decades, not Europe. You already have Eastern Europe and parts of Africa as your playground, you don't need our turf as well. 

USA: America, my country, is rooted in Corporatism, capitalism, and a willful disregard for laws when we feel like it. Our internal affairs are regularly harassed by Europeans in their ivory towers. How we choose to change and govern ourselves is our own choice-----and many of us choose corporations/big business. This can not, and will not, change.

However that does not change the fact that we have been, and will continue to be your biggest ally. Despite our different cultural values, that doesn't change. Not one bit. 

Israel: Absolutely disagree, increase aid to Israel as well as funding for ""Israeli Assimilation Programs"" for Palestinians. 

Syria, Lybia, Iraq et cetera: Absolutely agree. Literally no argument there. 

Ukraine: Essentially agree. Kiev and likeminded regions of Ukraine should join NATO, or at the very least the EU. 

Russia: Might need more planning than that. Have you seen his cabinet? Lavrov? The ultra nationalists AND ultra religious wanting to scheme for control? Putin might be ""Lawful Evil"" but he's still ""Lawful"", and predictable. Without him, whatever house of horrors he's holding back will come tumbling out. 


unfreezing Antarctica/Artic Ocean: It would be better if we work together and corporate, rather than dividing everything up so evenly. We have enough stress helping police and de-escalate the issues in the Pacific between Japan and China------you really don't want to lay the same foundations for tensions between NA, Europe, and Russia.

Since Greece cannot repay its debt, much of that debt will have to go away somehow. Greece can't devalue its currency to do that, because it joined the euro and everyone, including the Germans, should have been aware of that. After all the blame has gone around, the people in Athens have two options now, either default on their national debt, or negotiate for something better than that with the rest of the euro zone.

Even in negotiations, much of that debt will have to be forgiven. As I understand it, and again I am not included in all private councils at the top of the EU, governments understand this. Thing is, politicians can't always say what they know to be true. The Germans have shown that you cannot fix a regional economy, if you only hand over money. That is what they tried for almost fifteen years with the former DDR and it didn't work out so well. What needs to happen is that the Greeks reform their economy and state, so that their society becomes more productive. What also needs to happen is that the public in the rest of the EU doesn't feel they got ripped off. Both of those goals are achieved by the repetitions of high drama around the debt relief negotiations. In the end, I think that a reforming Greece will find that the debt burden will be relieved, quietly when the public is paying attention to something else. Probably not all of the debt, by the nature of negotiation, it will likely be more than the Greeks want and less than the creditors want, but something everyone can live with.

Ultimately no Greek government is going to have the electoral mandate to place its whole population in debt peonage for decades. Some of that debt will have to go unpaid eventually, but god is gracious to our politicians so they will not have to admit that for years.",null,0,null,1441059519,null,null,1441060233,0,cumcbpq,null,t3_3j2sfi,null,null,null,t1_cumat5j,null,null,null,1441614915,null,1,null,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

You seemed to care when:

- It was time to arm the ""Moderate rebels"" in recent years, many of whom crossed over to ISIS and are now killing fellow Syrians with American weapons.

- It was time to arms the Talibans against the Soviets

- To topple the Taliban government in Afghanistan (which you supported earlier). 

- It was time to invade Iraq because you THOUGHT they had WMDs, which turned out to be false and a mere made up cassus belli for dem sweet Iraqi resources

- To support the rebels against Qadaffi, and when they succeed and killed him, they plunged the state into another civil war, but that's not a concern of yours, Qadaffi was.

The gene-centric view is compatible with this.

&gt;  (also obviously false, since things like foraging-, mate-choice and offspring-rearing strategies are both heritable and fitness-relevant)

What leads you to say that these traits are not genetically determined?

&gt; The channels are genetics, cellular epigenetics, social learning and niche-construction (including culture), not just genetics alone.

In order for something to be inherited, it has to have a genetic component. One could argue that alleles of genes that control methylation/acethylation/etc were selected in a circumstance, thus favouring and increasing the plasticity of epigenetic modifications.

&gt; but there is still ample evidence in human history that certain population-wide cultural phenomena are conductive to the persistence and growth of the populations, and to their own spread to other cultures (certain metallurgy-practices are a rather well-studied example).

This is not evolution in the biological sense.

&gt; On a theoretical level, though, this too is absolutely sound: Imagine two somewhat separated populations of bonobos who nevertheless share roughly the same ecological situation. Now in one of them, there is a discovery of simple tool-manufacturing that is passed on parentally and alloparentally. The new tool allows them to extract more resources more efficiently from the same environment, and thus contributes to stability and growth. If the other population has nothing to compensate, they will not be able to sustain a similar increase in population size. If some strategy heritable through social learning becomes survival-critical for ecological reasons, lineages and populations where it is not present may even become extinct.

This will fall apart unless there was selection for some allele that favours the transmission of knowledge between individuals, as well as their learning abilities. And I can basically extrapolate this to all your arguments for group selection.

First, many immigrants coming in EU via Greece are not refugees. Please distinguish between refugee and immigrant. These people target Germany and Sweden the most.

The people who are in need and the ones we should help are in Syria and in refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. We should help them by building schools there, by improving health conditions, by making pressure internationally and trying to stop the war there. We should be united when ending the conflict in Syria! This is how you help the Syrian people and not by ""inviting"" the most adventurous ones (mostly youth between 20 and 30) to Europe taking dangerous trip via X countries. 
Secondly, there is a question we need to ask? are you refugee when you enter safe country and you try to get to another safe country? Is Turkey dangerous or Greece or Macedonia or Serbia or Hungary or Austria? I have been only in Greece and Austria, and I find them safe. Most of the syrian refugees are enormously greatful to Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Again, we should help there! we should help those countries  who carry the burden. The most vulnerable are there!!! If some country want to take some of them, do it! BUT choose in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon or Jordan and don't support this madness via Greece, you support the crimminals living from this chaos!

""Tyranny of the majority""

Yes, if many people do not want to see more refugees on their own soil, it's probably because they're ignorant and hateful, lol. That's a nice rationalization and it helps debunk even the most reasonable argument as ""ignorant hateful drivel"". 

The logical conclusion is that the power should be controlled only by an enlightened elite, and the people distracted enough not to make any fuss.

You know this is the rationale used by most autocrats in the world today, right? ""The majority is illiterate and cannot be trusted"". 

Except that's not true for Europe. 

A large number of people have gone to college and have travelled around the world. They're aware of their environment, in particular the geopolitical environment. They know when bad decisions are being made, because they've seen the consequences of the previous bad decisions.

[Der entindustrialisierte Osten](http://www.bpb.de/geschichte/deutsche-einheit/lange-wege-der-deutschen-einheit/47137/industrie-im-osten)

&gt;Die DDR war stark von ihrer Industrie geprägt. Nach 1990 brach diese Basis weg. Auch wenn es heute wieder einige Leuchtturm-Regionen gibt: Ostdeutschland ist immer noch weitestgehend entindustrialisiert.

&gt;Es fand ein allgemeiner Rückgang der Beschäftigung in Ostdeutschland von 10 Mio. Erwerbstätigen auf 6 Mio. im Jahre 1992 statt. Diese rückläufige Entwicklung setzt sich in abgeschwächtem Tempo bis heute fort: 1996 waren immer noch 6 Mio.

&gt;Tu parles de problèmes masculins    
    
Justement non, je dis que les hommes dans le porno n'ont pas de problèmes (ou pas plus que les femmes).    
Elle dit à propos de la paternité de Rocco Siffredi : ""Curieusement sur ce point, on ne vous entend pas moufter. Enfin, « curieusement »… Cela n’a rien de curieux, ce n’est juste une des innombrables preuves de l’inégalité entre hommes et femmes""    
    
Elle met ça sur le compte de l'inégalité, qui est présente dans le porno comme partout, mais justement je pense que ce n'est pas tout à fait exact dans ce cas particulier.    
Elle est bien placée pour savoir que beaucoup d'acteurs porno sont pères, mais les spectateurs ? On sait même pas qui ils sont les types, encore moins s'ils ont des gosses ou non, alors comment pourrait-on les juger pour ça ?    

Pour poursuivre sur son exemple, Rocco est italien et Ovidie écrit que c'est une chaîne italienne qui a fait sa pub récemment. Pas étonnant que les français ne soient pas sur son dos, faudrait déjà qu'ils en aient su quelque chose. En comparaison, Clara est une star locale avec beaucoup plus de visibilité.    
    
&gt;Personne n'aurait idée de commenter dans thread sur la faim en Afrique qu'en France aussi des gens meurent de faim.    
    
Je me répète mais cette comparaison n'est pas bonne puisque je ne dis pas ""les femmes sont très maltraitées dans le porno, mais n'oubliez pas que les hommes le sont aussi un peu"".    
Ce que je dis c'est : c'est vrai que les actrices porno subissent les conséquences du sexisme, mais ici je ne pense pas que ça soit une question d'inégalité de genre puisque les hommes sont tout simplement trop invisibles dans le milieu pour faire une bonne comparaison.

&gt; Ist Deutschland oder Neuseeland umweltfreundlicher? 

&gt; Letzte Woche hatten wir in meiner Deutschklasse eine Debatte über das Thema ""Umwelt"". Es gab zwei Gruppen: die Gruppe Neuseeland und die Gruppe Deutschland. Die Gruppe Deutschland sagte, dass Deutschland umweltfreundlicher als Neuseeland sei, und die Gruppe Neuseeland behauptete das Gegenteil. Die Gruppe Deutschland bestand aus fünf Personen: Nic, Daniel, Anthony, Regan und mir. Die Gruppe Neuseeland bestand aus nur vier Personen: Jacob, William, Callum und Reuben. In der Debatte wurden viele Fragen angesprochen, zum Beispiel: öffentliche Verkehrsmittel, die Verschmutzung des Landes, die Haltung zum Umweltschutz, wie Strom produziert wird und auch ein paar andere Dinge. 

&gt; Ich sprach als Erster für die Gruppe Deutschland, und auch die ganze restliche Debatte über. Ich sprach zuerst über die Sauberkeit und Gesundheit der Flüsse und Seen Neuseelands; zweitens sprach ich über das, was die neuseeländische Regierung getan hat, um der Umwelt zu helfen. Schließlich habe ich kurz über die erneuerbaren Energien Neuseelands gesprochen und warum sie nicht umweltfreundlich sind. Als ich über die Sauberkeit und Gesundheit der Flüsse und Seen Neuseelands sprach, sagte ich, dass mehr als 50 Prozent aller neuseeländischen Wasserstraßen nicht sicher fürs Schwimmen sind. Außerdem ist Neuseeland eines der schlechtesten Länder für die Erhaltung seiner Umwelt. Persönlich denke ich, dass dies an der neuseeländischen Grünen Partei liegt. Die Grüne Partei Neuseelands hat in die letzten ca. 20 Jahren nichts von Wert zur Verbesserung der Umwelt beigetragen. Die Ursache dafür ist vielleicht, dass die Grüne-Partei-Mitglieder mehr Zeit beim Pilze rauchen als beim Pilze schützen verbringen. Deswegen sind alle politischen Leitlinien der Grünen Partei doof und nie zum Tragen kommen.

&gt; Ich sprach auch über die erneuerbare Energien Neuseelands und warum sie nicht umweltfreundlich sind. Es gibt ein paar Staudämme in Neuseeland, die die meiste Energie Neuseelands produzieren, aber sie zerstören auch die Umwelt in ihrer Nähe. Das ist, was ich sagte, aber Callum war nicht davon überzeugt. Er dachte, dass es sich lohnt, die Energie so zu produzieren, aber ich bin anderer Meinung. Thema der Debatte war, welches Land umweltfreundlicher ist, und nicht, welches Land die meiste Energie produzieren kann. Deswegen, trotz des Versuchs, für Neuseeland saubere Energie zu erzeugen, sind Staudämme in Neuseeland einfach nicht umweltfreundlich. Wie können Staudämme umweltfreundlich sein, wenn sie die Umwelt zerstören? 

&gt; Der zweite Sprecher der Debatte war Callum. Wie vorher erwähnt, hat er ein bisschen auf meine Aussagen erwidert, besonders seine Meinung über Staudämme in Neuseeland, aber dann hat er auch seine eigenen Überlegungen präsentiert. Er sprach besonders darüber, wie Neuseeland seine Flora und Fauna schützt. Laut Cullum ist der Schutz der neuseeländischen Flora und Fauna sehr wichtig. Dann sprach er darüber, wie die Anzahl der Schwarzen Rotkehlchen in Neuseeland sich wegen der Maßnahmen der Regierung Neuseelands von 36 auf über 1200 erhöht hat. Obwohl ich im Prinzip damit einverstanden bin, ist das nur ein kleiner Teil der Geschichte. Die Umwelt besteht aus viel mehr als ein paar Rotkehlchen. Ich bin der Ansicht, dass all die verwendeten Ressourcen, um dieses kleine Problem zu lösen, viel effektiver genutzt werden könnten.

Renewables will never be the answer to anything but minuscule local production, because the energy source isn't reliable, be it wind, solar or waves - and in a lot of places in the world it's hardly even feasible.

The problem with localized energy production is already being investigated in USA, they want to use small fission reactors similar to the ones used on nuclear submarines as easy-to-install and low-maintenance distributed energy source, it will also be much cheaper. Of course, having a solar panel on every roof would certainly be beneficial to the energy system, but not from economical (and also, ironically, ecological, as these panels contain a lot of rare, toxic metals and other materials) standpoint, as nuclear power is still cheaper.

As for nuclear weapons, again, basic physics.

Probably spend a combined about an hour looking around and reading.

UK

&gt;Do you speak any languages besides English? (If yes: which and to what level?)

No, I do not. 

*No, I do not.*

&gt;What interests you about Europe?

Well it's where I live, so it's pretty important to keep my ear to the ground on what's happening on the continent. 

&gt;What are your favourite and least favourite things about /r/europe ?

Least favourite is probably the current wave of immigration threads and the racism that goes with them, although I think it's mostly just pent up anger. I think you mods dealt with a relatively minor problem with too much of a strong arm approach, and it's bitten this subreddit in the arse.. I think it'll die down on its own, eventually. 

Favourite? Am I allowed to say lack of yanks? That's my favourite thing about all regional subreddits. It's nothing personal, it's just nice to get the opinions of my own people, ya know?

&gt;Do you have experience as a moderator or similar?

I mod a few small subs, but none are that active and I don't mod them in any meaningful manner. 

&gt;Why do you want to be a moderator?

You've been making a bit of a pigs ear of it?

*ducks* 

&gt;why do you think you would be a good moderator?

I believe in hands off moderation where possible, and I think that's something that subs not based around any strict and obvious theme (askscience, askhistory, etc) require to stop things turning out like they have. To steal a phrase from the British police, I believe in modding by consent. I also think you guys need to be a hell of a lot more transparent in how you mod, particularly when it comes to bannings. 

&gt;do you have any expirence with statistics, datamining or reddit bots?

Well thanks to the past few weeks I now know immigration statistics like the back of my hand. But seriously, I don't know anything about any of those things. 

&gt;What is your opinion on the immigration megathread? What do you think went wrong (if anything)?

Negative. See above. 

&gt;What's one weakness you have?

I lie to get myself modded, then abuse that power instantly. Also, I make jokes at inappropriate times.

Some 6 hours or so perhaps intermittently throughout the week.

&gt;How often do you visit /r/europe[2] ?

Daily basis

&gt;What country are you normally **a** resident in?

Poland

&gt;Do you speak any languages besides English? (If yes: which and to what level?)

Polish is almost C1, Swedish used to be B2 but I'm rusty as hell

&gt;What interests you about Europe?

 Politics and economics mostly. And beer.

&gt;What are your favourite and least favourite things about /r/europe[3] ?

Favourite would have to be the great in depth discussions with people that are actually specialists in a given field and give their input. Sadly, many of them have left over recent years. Least favourite - the rampant and blatant racism and xenophobia that goes on.

&gt;Do you have experience as a moderator or similar?

I host a small sub called /r/tradeissues. Aside from the odd piece of spam, I wouldn't really call it moderating.

&gt;Why do you want to be a moderator?

 I've been complaining for months about the level of quality declining in this subreddit. It's starting to get to the point where I'm considering leaving as I get little joy out of most threads. It's time to put my money where my mouth is and try to make the place better.

&gt;why do you think you would be a good moderator?

I'm active regularly and at odd times to I would be able to be rather active in my moderation duties. I'm almost always, if not completely polite, then civil and I actually care about the wellbeing of this subreddit.

&gt;do you have any expirence with statistics, datamining or reddit bots?

Statistics, yes. None of the rest though.

&gt;What is your opinion on the immigration megathread? What do you think went wrong (if anything)?

It was absolutely necessary, barring a better idea that you guys are working on behind the scenes. Immigration topics dominate /r/europe to the detriment of other topics, the conversations within them are all the same, and they're really just targets for an echochamber of bigots and xenophobes. As to what went wrong, I think that there probably weren't enough moderators actively moderating it, and I think that there was a flaw in the design from the start (namely that it linked to removed posts). Instead, the megathread should've been put in contest mode, and the rules should've been that top level posts much have a link and discussion should focus on that link. Topics submitted to the subreddit about immigration should be removed with a message saying ""please post a link in the megathread"", rather than hotlinked in the megathread. 

&gt;What's one weakness you have?

Half the subreddit hates me. I'll be a controversial choice that could potentially make the moderator teams job harder. I imagine I'll definitely be a new d'Clauzel, but I can handle it. I can't wait for the /r/european thread about this.

&gt;Would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses?

Was it reset frequently to keep fresh content easier to find and so boosted content in the beginning wouldn't snowball and influence opinions too much?

I browse it on and off throughout the day, every day


&gt; How often do you visit /r/europe?

varies from 15 mins to 45 mins if good stuff is on front page.


&gt; What country are you normally resident in?

UK


&gt; Do you speak any languages besides English? (If yes: which and to what level?)

Very, very low level of german and esperanto


&gt; What interests you about Europe?

I find it interesting to learn of other places. I've always wanted to live abroad and Europe is the best continent in the world.


&gt; What are your favourite and least favourite things about /r/europe ?

My least favourite part can be the hostility to people outside of Europe notably in immigration discussions. However I like that it remains an open discussion.

My favourite part is that you learn a lot about other countries you won't hear on tv or in the news. The everyday differences is interesting to learn about.


&gt; Do you have experience as a moderator or similar?

Not really, no.

&gt; Why do you want to be a moderator?

I browse around on here a lot and would like to do something other than upvote and make the odd comment

&gt; why do you think you would be a good moderator?

I like to see an open discussion with only the actively hostile comments disrupted. I believe only a hands off approach is really helpful as a more honest discussion can be had.

&gt; do you have any expirence with statistics, datamining or reddit bots?

I don't know what kind of data reddit aquires but I can go through data as I have done statisitcs before.
 
&gt; What is your opinion on the immigration megathread? What do you think went wrong (if anything)?

N/a

&gt; What's one weakness you have?

Scheduling, if I became a mod I would be on and rather random times and not really consistently.

&gt; Would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses?

Horse sized duck, mass of the duck will appear to increase much more than the diameter of the legs, legs break immediately. Easy fight.

I'm a reddit fiend, on this site almost constantly from noon to the late night.

&gt; How often do you visit /r/europe?

Every day. It's my most visited sub by quite a margin.

&gt; What country are you normally resident in?

The UK

&gt; Do you speak any languages besides English? (If yes: which and to what level?)

I'm an Italian mothertongue.

&gt; What interests you about Europe?

Weeell...it's got everything doesn't it? natural beauty, art, history, about seven thousand languages, cuisine and alcohol to satisfy a glutton, so many different people and customs...what doesn't interest anyone about Europe?

&gt; What are your favourite and least favourite things about /r/europe?

Only on this sub can I get Macedonian events explained by Macedonians while a Balkan slapfight is taking place in the next thread and an argument about Scottish oil revenues goes on in another.

My least favourite thing is when all of this potential ends up giving births to thoughtless shouting matches or massive circlejerks. Fake but inciteful news, editorialized headlines and low-information content are often the starting points of these and I'd like to tackle them in particular. There's also a problem with racism and assorted bigotry just like there is in any political sub, but I think current rules and a larger mod team will be enough to handle that.

&gt; Do you have experience as a moderator or similar?

I was first a moderator and then an admin for a fairly large MTG community. In that capacity, I've handled everything from community policing to working with the site owners to copyright takedown requests.

&gt; Why do you want to be a moderator?

The main reason is that as it is the mod staff is severely undersized. I've got a few ideas like I said just above, but they come after making sure there are enough warm bodies to get through reports and removing shitposts in a timely fashion.

&gt; why do you think you would be a good moderator?

I've got experience of what that side of the experience looks like and what the mechanics of it are. I have a lot time to dedicate to it and while I like the more proactive parts I kind of enjoy the janitorial work of making sure the sub is clean and tidy.

&gt; do you have any expirence with statistics, datamining or reddit bots?

I've got years of experience under my belt with the first two, bring it on. I've dabbled with Automoderator a bit and I once tried to write a reddit bot just to see what it was like. My python skills are passable, so I guess all in all I can handle bots fairly well.

&gt; What is your opinion on the immigration megathread? What do you think went wrong (if anything)?

I think the immigration megathread and the active moderation had raised the level of the sub a lot, but the megathread failed because it took way too much work for the small mod staff to update it. I think the solution is workable so long as it's highly automated and the mods only have to deal with people actively trying to disrupt it.

&gt; What's one weakness you have?

There are parts of the year when I get swamped with work and can hardly breathe let alone reddit. In total it might be a few weeks, spread out over the year so it shouldn't be too catastrophic.

&gt; Would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses?

A horse-sized duck would collpase out of the inadequacy of its circulatory system and likely its skeleton, so I'm going with that one.

null,null,BlueHatScience,null,null,null,"&gt; What leads you to say that these traits are not genetically determined?

Depends on what kind of individuals we are talking about (taxonomically / cladistically)... or more directly, what kinds of phenotypic plasticity (including mechanisms for passing on behavioral, cognitive and emotional traits / dispositions) is available. 

In populations where no non-genetic means of inheritance are present, any foraging or mate-choice strategies will either have to be re-constituted in every generation, or will have to be inherited solely via genes. But most living things do niche-construction and epigenetics, so those are rather prevalent throughout all domains and kingdoms, while social learning is less frequent, most social animals with neural networks have this to some extent. Culture is far less frequent, but is not only absolutely essential and overwhelmingly influential for human populations, but also present (though far less pervasively) in most primates and many mammals in general.

That's what the evolutionary advantages of phenotypic plasticity (including the learning and planning abilities of our neural networks) *are* - to allow generation, passing-on and variation of  fitness-relevant traits (e.g. behavioral strategies)  - and thus directed, short and medium-term adaption, without being constricted to the huge timescales of genetic change. 

The adaptivity of increased phenotypic plasticity and multiple inheritance channels is why such forms of life spread, why the major transitions happened and the established features took hold and spread throughout the world.

The alleles are of course central for determining the anatomical structures required for this kind of phenotypic plasticity including social &amp; cultural learning (though the final form of the anatomical structures also depends strongly on developmental resources) - but they merely constrain, not actually determine the *specific* socially and culturally inherited traits. They can't - behavioral strategies can be and are adapted within generations, and radical changes (e.g. through technology) can happen on far far smaller timescales than genetic changes. 

More fundamentally, the number of bits (though we should more realistically count in base-4 because of the number of nucleotides) in a genome is by far not enough to determine all the information present in the structure of the neural networks that drive the behavior - that's what neural networks are for - to adapt dynamically, without requiring genome-level changes and a many new generations of offspring for every behavioral change.

Mate-choice strategies are strongly culturally determined. For example, in many human societies, most won't consider someone a viable candidate for mating if they don't conform to certain social and cultural norms inherited through enacted, oral and/or written tradition, not via genes. 

Similarly, foraging strategies in humans (and other animals) are extremely dependent on technology and technique - where the specific technologies and techniques are most certainly not encoded in alleles. But you can find much simpler examples in for example the development and inheritance of foraging strategies among other primates or among rats. Strategies developed by applying neural phenotypic plasticity to ecological circumstances, not by genetic mutation.

&gt;This is not evolution in the biological sense.

The contributors - both pro and contra - of the *Nature* piece I cited disagree with this assessment. We can also look at who is having these discussions, in what journals the findings are published under what tags and with which terms applied... you'll find that they certainly are researched as processes in evolution - the evolution of trait-distributions and fitness-landscapes in populations of biological organisms. 

Biology is more than just population genetic / genomics.... It's the same evolution we have always studied - the same sets of structures, traits and dynamics we have always tried to understand... and it would be a huge mistake to suppose that population genetics exhausts all of evolutionary theory, much less all of biology. 

I have the greatest respect for genetics, but not to the exclusion of all other areas of peer-reviewed research about evolution in biology.

As shown already by Maynard-Smith and Szathmary (and even more so in the other literature I cited), all the levels of inheritance and selection necessarily influence each other. 

Genetics determines the potential and constraints on other levels of inheritance and selection because it determines the required anatomy. Anatomical preconditions and the available means of social inheritance (and the selection-pressures) together with ecological factors in turn constrain what kinds of molecular, cellular, behavioral and cultural niche-construction inheritance and selection there can be. And because individuals face selection pressures as a whole, fitness-relevant traits inherited through any channel will affect the trait-distributions for traits inherited through all levels, including the genetic level, since fitness-relevant, non-genetically inherited behaviors affect who mates with whom how successfully, thus partially determining the allele-distributions in future generations.

In the end, what we want to know is how the various forms (traits) and their distributions we see in nature come about, how the dynamics of their distributions work, and how they are relevant to their own persistence and spread - that is evolutionary theory, in all its beauty of all its many facets.

It is inviting (especially of course for a geneticist) to see evolution mainly in the operationalizations of the specific sub-field of genetics, because it has been so successful and dominant.

But in light of all of this - in light of who is having the debate, where it is being published, and what terms they use, and what the analyses of inheritance, fitness and selection show,  there is no doubt all of this is about (biological) evolution.... unless of course one might want to maintain that epigentics, ecology and ethology for example are not ""biology"".

&gt;This will fall apart unless there was selection for some allele that favours the transmission of knowledge between individuals, as well as their learning abilities.

Huh? What's falling apart here? Primates have extremely well studied faculties for social learning. In so far as this requires certain anatomical structures, which it does in terms of our biological neural networks, the required genetic foundation for this kind of transmission of behavioral phenotypic traits obviously exists.

But again, the alleles involved constrain and determine anatomical development - but social learning is performed by embodied neural networks through various mechanisms - with the predispositions for activity-patterns representing the behavioral traits being the result of dynamic interaction with the environment - not being encoded in DNA.

As the research on the major transitions shows, the ""higher levels"" have the lower levels as foundations, so of course the ability to make use of social inheritance requires inheritance of anatomical traits, which happens largely via DNA-transfer. But nobody was supposing otherwise... so I'm afraid I don't see how that constitutes a critcism? 

Though I'm sure you are aware - we should also mention that even looking only at genetics / genomics, it hasn't been as simple as ""this allele is responsible for this phenotypic trait"" for a long long time. There are networks of genes being regulated by other networks of genes and generally being dependent in their expression on various both intra- and extra-genetic information and developmental resources.

The Weismann doctrine is no longer tenable, epigenetics and other research into inclusive inheritance has revealed multiple levels of inheritance, multiple mechanicsms, units and levels - all of which are affected by selection, and thus must be accounted for by evolutionary theory.

Ever since the modern evolutionary snythesis, we have been doing just that - increasing our knowledge and theoretical tools to model all the factors of evolution. DNA has remained central, which is as it should be, since it certainly plays a special foundational and univeral role in evolution - but we can no longer forcibly and artificially exclude anything outside of the cell-nucleus of germ-line cells from playing a role in evolution, we know far too much for that.

So again - as demonstrated by the *Nature*-piece, the current debate is over *how* to incorporate this knowledge into evolutionary theory and whether paradigm shifts are needed, not whether these are processes in evolution.

5) My interests on Europe revolve around Architecture and History, being raised by two architect parents I learned a lot about Europe's history of buildings. I also have read and studied a lot of History from Louis XIV until today, mainly focusing on the Industrial Revolution, the Development of Russian Marxism 1861-1917 and the Interwar Period.

It is always delightful to learn about other cultures and histories in a playful and light-hearted manner.

To many users today, the Mod Team seems like some ominous shadow organization that barely ever speaks, and if it does, then only to bring what they perceive as bad news.

Whilst I do not doubt that the intentions behind it were stellar, the Megathread gave people a feeling of censorship and bias. 

12) I would say that I get carried away by other people's statements too easily and often start debates and arguments that I am aware aren't worth it and will affect no one. So yes, I am a little bit short-tempered, but I am working on improving that.

Un peu plus détaillé :

Progressivement depuis 2005, la plupart des gros du secteur se sont obstiné à rééditer d'anciens jeux qui ont marché par le passé, c'est moins risqué et ça rapporte toujours autant (tant que les graphismes changent).  Typiquement CoD, Unreal Tournament &amp; autre FPS qui se ressemble, Rayman, tous les jeux Blizzard, les MMORPG...  Il y avait déjà un certain manque d'innovation.

Puis vint Minecraft et autres jeux indépendant vers 2008-2010 qui ont donné un énorme souffle d'air frais et créatif.  Minecraft typiquement est programmé avec les pieds et de mauvaise qualité technique mais l'idée est très novatrice.

Il y a eu un gigantesque boom du jeu vidéo indépendant (2010-2012), facilité encore plus avec l'apparition des plateformes comme Steam et aussi les éditeurs de jeux comme Unity (le RPG Maker XP du jeu vidéo indépendant).

Sauf que le marché n'était pas si grand que ça et est arrivé très vite à saturation (2013-2014).  Les grosses entreprises ont profitées de l'aubaine pour elles aussi faire du jeu vidéo indépendant, comme d'habitude sans grande innovations, misant tout sur le graphisme.

Les petites équipes « indépendantes », faute de graphistes, tentent de trouver des manières de jouer qui cassent avec les jeux AAA.  Sauf qu'elles sont financièrement sur la corde et font énormément de concessions sur le plan technique, et ne retiennent en générale qu'une seule idée pour aller plus vite.  Les jeux qui en résultent sont facilement finit à 100% en 3 à 4 heures et complètement buggé, avec beaucoup de répétitions.

Donc on est à peu près revenu à la situation de 2007, sauf qu'il y a beaucoup plus de monde et le marché est saturé.  Y'en a qui ne pourront plus tenir la cadence et se seront sûrement les développeurs indépendants.  Il ne restera que quelques grosses entreprises qui seront en situation de monopole.

If this was an application thread for a single moderator, I probably wouldn't even bother.

However, I am applying for what, I believe, is a good reason and one most of this subreddit can get behind. For more details, check ""why do you want to be a moderator"".

&gt;How often are you on reddit in an average week?


That depends on how much work I have. However, I usually browse reddit at least 1-2 hours a day and, sometimes, it can be way, waaaay more than that. It's kind of embarrassing, really.

---

&gt;How often do you visit /r/europe?

The vast majority of my lurking time on reddit is in /r/europe. The majority of my posts are also in /r/europe. So...quite often.

---

&gt;What country are you normally resident in?

I move a lot due to work but, for the foreseeable future, I will be residing in east coast Canada. That means I mainly lurk in the off hours where most people are asleep. 

---

&gt;Do you speak any languages besides English? (If yes: which and to what level?)

My mother tongue is Greek. I can also understand some German, although I am very rusty in them.

---

&gt;What interests you about Europe?

I was born here :)

But besides the obvious, I like European politics and have some basic understanding of most countries' current political situation. I am mostly in /r/europe to discuss its politics and their effects on the population.

---

edit: oups, forgot this one!

&gt;What are your favourite and least favourite things about /r/europe?

Favourite: This sub has many great discussions frequently, which is rather rare for most subreddits this size. I honestly think this is the greatest strength of this sub. This and many fun tibits and top bantz about various European nations.

Least Favourite: This sub has too many camps that yell at each other with no intention of ever changing their minds. This directly hurts my favourite thing about this subreddit. I hope I can help reduce that!

---

&gt;Do you have experience as a moderator or similar?

Absolutely none and automoderator could as well be casting spells for all I know. However, I usually learn the computer hocus pocus rather fast when needed.

---

&gt;Why do you want to be a moderator?

Right, I will be blunt on this one: because I am a right winger.

However, that doesn't mean what some might expect. I don't think there is a ""grand conspiracy of left wingers"" in this sub's moderation. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it is pretty much a fact that there isn't such a conspiracy.

As a right winger, I would have the ""legitimacy"" to do something the current mods can't do due to calls of ""censorship"": I can properly moderate immigration threads. If I become a moderator, I will probably spend most of my time whacking over the head two types of people:

-the ""I am not racist but muslims should be gassed"" people

-the ""everyone who disagrees with me in &lt;shill, racist, SJW&gt;"" people.

I intend to enforce civility and try to bring the discussion back to people discussing an event rather than a yelling competition. I strongly opposed the megathreads (even got banned for it, although it was reversed) but the current situation is getting slightly out of hand. My main reason for being a moderator is to help balance the front page again.

---

&gt;why do you think you would be a good moderator?

Check preface for a detailed answer on that. For tl;dr: I don't think I would be the best one. I do think I would be a competent one. I also think my presence in the moderation team, in itself, would be a good thing.

---

&gt;do you have any experience with statistics, data-mining or reddit bots?

I have extensive experience with statistics. In fact, I got a minor on that! I do not have any experience on data mining or reddit bots.

---

&gt;What is your opinion on the immigration megathread? What do you think went wrong (if anything)?

I strongly opposed it. I still strongly oppose any such solutions. Immigration is a very complex story but the basics (people going from X to Y) has been talked about to death and anything worthwhile has been said. The point of immigration threads is to discuss specific *events* that happen as they happen. That is not possible in a megathread. Megathreads are....okey for single events, not great, but okey. They are absolutely terrible as a permanent solution for discussing a major topic.

&gt;What's one weakness you have?

[I usually vörk all day and neglect my family. Fok em.](https://youtu.be/2W0WsdLobq8?t=138)

---

&gt;Would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses?

Obviously a hundred duck sized horses. Horses are stupid and they won't form up to fight you. You can just bash em to death one by one while they are trying to flee from you. Also, they can be latter used for delicious, duck-sized horse steaks!

&gt; What interests you about Europe?


European history, identitiy, politics. Random facts about all the countries and their cultures and traditions

&gt; What are your favourite and least favourite things about /r/europe?


The only sphere of European public I know that one can interact with easily. I love to get to know and discuss issues with a wide number of people from the European countries. 

My least favourite thing is probably that racism and xenophobia have common-place in the past year. If these incidents are singular, they can be dealt with easily and some good discussions can occur, however if all threads are dominated by the same rethoric and lack of quality content, it becomes an overall problem of the subreddit.

&gt; Do you have experience as a moderator or similar?

I have been a moderator for a variety of internet forums, but not reddit (/edit: Actually, I just became mod at /r/projectreality ). Most importantly though, I work in the moderation of a German NGO website and have to moderate requests to politicians. 

&gt; Why do you want to be a moderator?

Because I think I can be a reasonable force in the moderation of the subreddit and don't want to see one of my favourite subreddits go down the drain of the standard subreddits.

&gt; Why do you think you would be a good moderator?

Where I work, I work according to a special codex and have learned to look for quality of submissions, and not care if they don't affirm my opinion. I am a firm believer of freedom of speech (within reasonable limits, I like the system in Germany) and I have learned to accept and support other's opinions if they are presented in a reasonable way. I can also answer to user requests and I never resort to personal attacks and insults.

&gt; Do you have any expirence with statistics, datamining or reddit bots?

I have a degree in political science; however my statistics knowledge is rather limited. I have designed and conducted qualitative surveys though.

&gt; What is your opinion on the immigration megathread? What do you think went wrong (if anything)?

While I generally supported it, it gave unnecessary fuel to the debate about freedom of speech in the subreddit. I believe a firmer moderation of submissions, checking for duplicates and redundant content could have prevented the drama. However, as the current state of the subreddit shows, the domination and one-sided discussion on immigration issues essentially clogs the subreddit and prevents the interesting and diverse content that /r/europe is loved for. I came here to learn about what is going on in other countries and enjoy a healthy mix of political discussion, random facts and thoughts as well as cultural exchange.
