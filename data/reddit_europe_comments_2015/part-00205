Regarding your unrelated comment (?!)

.

&gt; In Serb-dominated Yugoslavia,[56] unlike the preceding Austro-Hungarian Empire,[57] the option to ethnically declare oneself Bosniak was unrecognized throughout the existence of Yugoslavia.[58] As a political compromise, the Constitution of Yugoslavia was amended in 1968 to introduce ""Muslims"" in a national (as opposed to religious) sense; effectively recognizing a constitutive nation whilst avoiding the recognition of ""Bosniak"" or ""Bosnian"" as ethnic or national designations. Prior to this, the great majority of Bosnian Muslims had declared either Ethnically Undecided Muslim or – to a lesser extent – Undecided Yugoslav in censuses pertaining to Yugoslavia as the other available options were Serb-Muslim and Croat-Muslim.[59] Albeit achieving recognition as a distinct nation by an alternative name, the use of Muslim as an ethnic designation was opposed early on as it sought to label Bosniaks a religious group instead of an ethnic one.
&gt; Upon Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the great majority of Bosnian Muslims aligned themselves with the Bosniak name.

The UK has refrained from taking an active role in international conflicts since half a decade now. China has, by a large margin, the largest army in the world, also they spend more on military than russia and france combined. However they are limiting their influence on their own surrounding area, they are not taking an active role in international conflicts either. Thus, I would qualify them as a major power, but not as superpowers. Russia on the opposite has a faulty system, they have lots of issues with maintaining their army (I read about them not even being able to sustain supplies for army exercises, forcing their soldiers to cannibalize equipment if they need replacement parts for other equipment, people dying due to malfunctions etc), yet they take an active role in international politics and they still have enough hard power to back this up. For all of the recent crises, be it Ukraine (naturally), Syria, Libya etc., there is no way past russia if you aim to resolve these crises. I did not equalize non-aggressiveness with weakness, however not wanting to be a part of anything is somewhat a sign of weakness.

&gt; Here, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood is depicted dying from bullets passing through his Quran, and the text reads ""Killings in Egypt – Quran is shit – It doesn't stop bullets"". The context is the slaughter of supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood by the Egyptian military following the coup d'État against president Morsi. This cover has often been mentioned as an example of Charlie Hebdo's supposed indifference towards, and even hatred against, Muslims. As with previous accusations, this misses the mark: the cover does not reflect indifference towards the killings, but instead seeks to highlight their intense cruelty, and more importantly the fact that many of the victims were completely unarmed. The phrase ""The Quran is shit – it doesn't stop bullets"", in this context, is to be understood as ""Of course the Quran doesn't stop bullets. And it is all that many of these protesters had against the violence unleashed by the military."" The cover therefore denounces, through satire and purposely shocking imagery, the Egyptian military's violence against those unarmed citizens; it does not support it. Some have argued that a secondary message of the cartoon was that the Quran gave a false sense of security to protesters, that ""religion had failed the Muslim Brotherhood"", but it is difficult to make a definitive claim on this secondary aspect without asking the author.

* Elections for the federal state parliaments of Styria and Burgenland. The elections have turned into a bit of a vote over immigration. As all the other parties refuse to be even critical of further immigration, the right extremist FPÖ has come close to 1/3 of the votes for parties that got over the threeshold. The core issue of the state politics for this election were fusions of minor communities. The FPÖ had a campaign that claimed that it was the end of civilisation that villages with under 1000 inhabitants don't have their own city hall anymore. The election in Burgenland had taken the same course. Both states were won by the Social Democrats, the Conservatives got the second place place and right extremists got the third place. With 27%, they are just to percent points behind the Social Democrats in Styria.
* A [new website](http://www.eaudestrache.at/) collects comments from the Facebook pages of the right extremist party FPÖ. The audience has shown mixed reactions. Some are amused, while others are terrified about comments like **""I say just one thing: Arbeit macht frei""** (about criminal asylants)  **""Through the chimney""** (about the same criminal asylants) or **""this fanatical inzest is getting more and more dangerous""** (about public religious activities of muslims). 
* After a 35 year long legal battle, the Federal Administrative Court had validated the building permit for a tunnel under the Semmering mountain ridge.

We'll have to agree to disagree then. Maybe it's because I mainly focus on power potential and you focus more on practised power output. The reason I see it my way is because as politics can change with the wind you can suddenly end up scrambling your list if you look at it your way. But that doesn't make it a bad way to look at it.

Know that I definitely would not put Russia behind major power on our mini-list, just to be clear. They have a large army, and even though their weapons are old, they have assloads of them.

&gt; However they are limiting their influence on their own surrounding area, they are not taking an active role in international conflicts either.

You struck an interesting topic here! Russia and China reject the notion of a 'global security' and instead are all for carving off pieces wherever they can get it (don't forget that China still occupies Tibet, everybody seems to forget this though :p ). While Europe and the US advocate the global security notion, though through slightly different means.

The other difference is older - Bulgaria was established in 681 AD by the Bulgars, who were a nation of arguably Iranic origin, whose country ""Old Bulgaria"" near modern day Crimea was destroyed. They mixed with the slavs south of the Danube and made the Bulgarian nation, which is therefore not entirely slavic as the Poles or Czechs for example, but a combination of the Iranic Bulgarians and the local Slavs and Thracians.

Through the years, I came to different conclusions about these bombs. Did you know that the fire bombing of Tokyo had more civillian casulties? I believe bombing was wrong. Be it Japan, Germany or Vietnam later on. But the atomic bomb ended the war. How many more casulties would there have been without the end. Not only in Japan, but also in China, where Japan was waging a brutal war on civillians. The US had seen lots of Japanese civillians committing suicide rather than surrender to their forces. What would have been the outcome of an invasion of major Japanese islands. These days I condemn the conventional bombing and support the atomic drops. Strange as that may seem.

Avessero preso il 20% ci crederei pure ad una probabile alternativa ma con un dato tra il 10-15% massimo non credo vadano lontano. Poi magari mi sbaglierò e diventeranno il nuovo podemos ma ci credo poco. Se podemos ha successo è perchè si tratta di una sinistra fuori dagli schemi, fatta di persone giovani e nuove alla scena politica che sfruttano il web e le nuove tecnologie in maniera eccellente per diffondere il loro messaggio. Cofferati,Pastorino e Civati non sono certo nuovi, non ce li vedo a proporsi come alternativa alla vecchia politica e di certo non sono capaci di sfruttare il web come podemos per diffondersi. E sono convinto che comunque il 10-15% per cento che han preso in liguria fosse più un grande F**K YOU degli elettori al PD Renziano (e alla sua gestione delle primarie e dei candidati in liguria) e alla Paita piuttosto che un voto di opinione per Civati,Cofferati e co. 

Edit:Comunque ripensandoci a qualcosa questa storia è servita. Secondo me adesso il PD dovrà farà più attenzione a come gestisce le primarie ed a chi candida se non vuole ritrovarsi in altre situazioni stile liguria. E magari Renzi diventa pure meno spaccone e impara ad ascoltare meglio anche chi non è d'accordo con lui. Peccato solo che tutto ciò debba avere come effetto collaterale una liguria in mano a Toti e ai Berluscones. Vedremo se ne sarà valsa la pena in futuro!

Secondo Edit: A quanto pare i sondaggi dicevano boiate(che sorpresa) e Pastorino sta all'incirca al 7% e la Paita intorno al 30%. Se il dato rimane questo(e non è un altra boiata di coloro che fanno proiezioni) la possibilità che Civati Cofferati e co. diventino un alternativa al PD è quasi uguale allo zero (cosa che sospettavo) . Insomma ora come ora l'unico risultato in termini numerici sarebbe stato far vincere Toti per 2-3 punti percentuali. Speriamo che perlomeno questa storia serva di lezione sia al PD renziano sia alle varie minoranze (devono inziare entrambi a collaborare ed a venirsi un po' incontro altrimenti litigando vince il Berlusca ).",null,0,null,1433110336,null,0,1433113342,0,crr83lb,null,t3_37zrv6,null,t1_crr83lb,null,t1_crr7ddr,null,null,null,1433504361,null,7,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,7,null

Mean is 41.12

Median is 46! 

The median is always the number that separates the distribution into halves, or else the average of the two ""middle"" values - - the mean is only going to be the halfway point if the distribution is symmetric.

The reason the median data would be interesting is it would tell us even more about the demographic fate of Germany because we would know what age separates each half of the ""old"" or ""young"".

if it's a very, very *old* age one has to reach before you're breaching into half the distribution of ages, the population is *quite* old overall, for instance.

if you only need to be 16 in order to be in the old half of the population, there are lottttaaaa babies in the country.

One trick that worked very well for me was keeping a permanent medium sized super friendly ally right next to me, if in Europe, best if it is someone in the HRE: You keep having royal marriages with them and keep your prestige up and while keeping one border safe you also have the chance of PU. 

I played as Flanders and I allied with then East Frisia who slowlly too parts of the Hannover region while also aiding me against Burgundy and France. If I manage to get an alliance with Spain and Austria in early game I can beat France and let them spit out Guyenne and smaller countries that I can diploannex. So I usually end up with most of cosmopolitaine France (including Paris, but be careful with AE!) by the time I start exploring. Then it is all about keeping England from becoming strong so you get all that sweet, sweet trade income. If I'm lucky, I get a PU about 200 years into the game with East Frisia, which the last time has even formed Hannoveria while I get rich and slowly take the rest of France (which lands are great to expand your army)

- Portugal gained is independence from the Kingdom of ""León and Castilla"" not from Spain. Portugal = 1143, Spain = 1479
- The royal family run away to Brazil during the French Invasions (of Napoleon) but the country wasn't ever conquered by the french troops, even despite the fact that they tried for 3 times, of course we had the help of the English soldiers too.

Yeah, they're crazy like that at the time. After that he captured 30 fishermen, dismembered them and placed their bodies part in the river tide so that their families could found them.
- Portugal didn't intervened directly in the WW II but [they did help a bit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_air_ferry_route_in_World_War_II) and this was one of the main reason why Portugal is one of the original members of NATO.

The embassador/leader of this embassy was the portuguese explorer Tristão da Cunha (the island is named after him)

- The first non-white/ethnic minority British MP was Dadabhai Naoroji, Liberal Party MP for Finsbury Central, 1892-1895. Interestingly, Naoroji had on his parliamentary staff Muhammad Al Jinnah, who became the founder and first leader of Pakistan.

- The British police are the only police force in the world that gets its authority from the consent of the people. *Policing by Consent* is the mantra that has governed British policing since the start. 

- British police were unarmed in order to quell citizens' fears that the newly-formed Police would oppress dissent and act as a psuedo-military arm of the state, prohibiting citizens' freedom. British police officers regularly vote on whether they should be routinely armed - these votes always end with about 70% or more voting to remain unarmed. The opinion is held by the Police and the citizens of the UK that arming the police would make them seem more of a threat than a reassurance, which would hinder their work and would harm their very good relationship with the people.

- The British Government recently banned any substance that can produce a ""Psychoactive effect'. This could mean literally ANY object, substance, or even concept could be banned because all things in the universe can potentially create a psychoactive effect of some sort.

Russian is a lot harder than Ukrainian because most of things sound not the way they written and quite a lot of exceptions. 

Same for English. It isn't the easiest language to learn. Grammar is completely messed up, hundrets of exceptions and archaisms. Yeah, it doesn't have grammar and gender cases, but that's not the way how you measure complexity.

Generally speaking I am in favor of a joint european army, however I think it is impossible to reach that goal unless we have a full union (and even then some points remain) due to several points.

* The French, Brits and Italy (and likely more countries) are too proud to give up on their armies
* It would prompt ideological debates that do not have a solution, especially considering nukes and export of arms
* The arms industries of the member states of the EU would be forced to merge or go bankrupt. There will only one type of each weapon needed over the course of 20-40 years. Once one company has secured a deal, the other companies could essentially give up on development for this category as exports alone wont pay for the development cost. Also, there are problems attached since some arms industries (e.g. nexter) are (at least partly) state-owned and are running deficits. 
* Since troups would be mixed in europe, there is a problem with the salary of the troops. It would be unjustified to pay a romanian soldier deployed in the UK less than a UK soldier, however, a UK soldier in romania would still need to earn as much as before because the possible savings on a romanian salary is non-existant in UK terms. It would probably end up with soldiers in UK being badly payed and Romanian soldiers being overpayed. 
* In case of events like in Mali, it would be really troublesome to send troops since most of europe does not have a connection to that country, it would be hard to sell it to the population why a e.g. polish soldier died protecting a former colony of france.

It is a pity since elimiminating doubled structures and cutting down on size would have a lot of potential for increase of power of the troops while cutting costs at the same time. I do not know what germanys stance on this issue is. 

As for the federalized EU, I personally am in favor of it. However, I deem it unlikely that this is a project of a few years. We do not even have a functioning democratic system for the EU and I have not seen suggestions for a system that would actually work. We seriously need europe-wide parties together with paneuropean votings where you do not only vote for your national representatives. If we ever reach a federalized union, I also do not have any problems with mutual debts. However, a 'real' union would need to stand strong against the interests of the member-states to prevent cherrypicking. 

I am also in favor of the EU having a say on national budgets (opposite to mr. Tsipras, who just spoke out against anything of that kind in his article in *le monde*), at least to a certain extend, to prevent large-scaled mismanagement and fiscal irresponsibility. Our finance minister is somewhat in favor of this, at least it is seen way more favorable in Germany than it is seen in many other countries. 

The single digital and service market seem good ideas to me, however I have not looked that deep into the issues, so i might have overseen some problems attached to those actions.

Also, currently we know where they are from. They are currently telling us. That is why we know they are from Nigeria, Chad, Mali, Sudan, etc. 
The ones who will do this as you descripe will be returned to their country they left in boats from. Libya in this case.
This will force Libya to get is shit together and it will make the immigrants talk. Since they would probably rather be returned to their birth country than Libya.

That only happened in 1945 when all sides were sick and tired of fighting, Europe having been the stage of two world wars and the first industrial genocide in human history. Churchill had given his famed speech (""a united states of Europe"") and French foreign minister Robert Schuman used that unique historical opportunity to further his radical idea of how a future war could be prevented.

Instead of merely *hoping* all sides would cooperate peacefully in the future, Schuman wanted to ""tie them together"" legally and economically. The idea was to pool coal and steel production between France and Germany, make unilateral armament against the other impossible and improve trade (converge national interests more and more).

The resulting European Coal and Steel Community is the precursor of the EU. It already had a sort of commission (High Authority) and something like the European Court of Justice where the High Authority could sue a signatory if they believed ECSC law was being violated.

Really? People on this sub spout opinions based on completely acid-induced fantasies constantly and you being this shy about this post a gem of a personal analysis? Your opinion is very interesting and even though not based in 100% professional knowledge (but whose is?) it's very well thought out.

As for your pointers on the EU army/foreign policy. I have 4 things to say:

- Completely agree with the difficulty with pride part. Mostly agree with your look on the Mali case.
- Partly agree with the ideological debates, but I don't think they would make or break any such process, as these debates are also done all the time within any free country in the world.
- The arms industry argument is well founded, though this is more a practical problem than a fundamental problem: It would definitely require serious practical thinking and some compromising.
- I'm not sure how the income inequality problem would play into this as even in the US there is substantial regional income inequality and I don't know the the US army works with this. What did occur to me with your comment, however, is that the army would indeed be mixed. So I got to wondering how that will mix with all the languages, and that this will probably create actual total random mixing of European peoples (as most armies of big, diverse nations/empires have done in history), interesting..

null,false,Asyx,NRHW,"North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany",null,"""Language X is the hardest language in the world"" is always bollocks. Always. Difficulty always depends on your native language and no Indo-European language will ever be the hardest language for a native speaker of another Indo-European language.

Even the fancy rankings you sometimes see are bullshit in the way people interpret them. The American government has a ranking on how many class hours they need to educate people in a particular language. Japanese is the hardest language there being in the same category as Mandarin. But other languages of the same language family as Mandarin are in lower categories. Why? Because Sino-Tibetian languages are isolating making them very easy for English native speakers because English is very similar to isolating languages. It isn't isolating traditionally but because they lost so many endings, it kind of is.

The difficulty for Chinese languages and Japanese are only in the last category because of the writing. It just takes an AWFUL lot of time to learn Chinese characters and they make even less sense in Japanese than in Chinese languages and Japanese itself is agglutinative making it weirder for native English speakers.

Also, those rankings exclude minority languages almost nobody wants to learn anyway. If you want something that truly fucks your head, look at Navajo.

Navajo and many other Apache languages put more meaning in their verbs. Verbs have slots where you basically fill in affixes that mean certain things. One of for aspect, for example, because Navajo doesn't really express tense so the point in time. Instead, they have a giant aspect system which expresses the way time flows. Like, ""I went"" means that there is a point in time where you went somewhere. ""I was going"" means that there is a span in time where you were going somewhere. In that span of time, other things could have happened. As in ""I was going to my friend and then some Polish dude jumped out of the bushes and threw an empty vodka bottle at me"".

The Navajo aspect system is just a lot bigger.

Then there is animacy. It's like gender but with more categories. It depends on how much the object is moving and agency. Humans are usually in the ""most animate"" category. Then you've got stuff like children, then rivers, then lightning, then wind and then a stone or something.

I said earlier that they put more information in their verb. In Navajo, if you have a cigarette and a pack of cigarettes on a table and you wanted to ask somebody to give you one or the other, you'd say ""give me the tobacco"" but specify what you want in the verb. You'd put a different affix in the slot for the classifier that either indicates a long, thing object (the single cigarette) or a small compact object (the whole package).

Navajo truly forces you to think about different things when you speak.

In fact, because it's so different, it's very popular for language construction to find inspiration because it's virtually impossible to take a feature from Navajo and accidentally make it look like a weird copy of English.",null,0,null,1433115386,null,0,false,0,crranzn,null,t3_37z6v6,null,t1_crranzn,null,t1_crr84wv,null,null,null,1433505571,null,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14,null

Syrians in Saudi Arabia will sound different. But at least they can communicate without a translator. 

again, my knowledge about the arab language is limited but i know from arab speakers that there are several arab speaking countries that don't understand each other at all. if you are sure or have a good reason to believe that saudis and syrians understand each other without problems we can put this issue aside. but just saying that they both speak arab so they should understand each other is a bit ignorant.

&gt;They aren't the same culture, that is not what I said. But in the same culture group. They have a lot in common, more than with Danish culture. 

how you quantify this would be interesting.

&gt;10% are christians. Not really fair to try and make it so Syrians aren't Muslim. There are many different muslim groups in Saudi Arabia currently. 

i said quite a few. 10% are quite a few. 

also wahhabism is undisputabely the mainstream religion in saudi arabia. it is also not really up for discussion that the majority of the syrian sunnies do not subscribe to wahhabism.

&gt;Try to make the neighbor countries take responsibility for their region, and you might have less wars. 

check your globe. saudi arabia is not a neighbour of syria. of the neighbours syria actually has:

israel: has reasons not to take in many refugees from syria. they are more concerned about securing their borders to a country they're technically still at war with

lebanon: has already taken in a huge amount of refugees from syria.

jordan: i wouldn't be suprised if the biggest syrian filled refugee camp there had more inhabitants than the city you live in

iraq: is at war itself

turkey: takes in a massive amount of refugees

so how much more are the neighbours supposed to do?

null,false,IvanMedved,RUSS,Bunker,null,"&gt;If you have the time, here is a nice reading shedding some light on the past of Ukraine and surrounding countries.

Nice propaganda peace. It mostly contains factual information with exception of:

&gt;It is established beyond reasonable doubt that Stalin intentionally starved to death Soviet Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-1933. Soviet documents reveal a series of orders of October-December 1932 with evident malice and intention to kill. By the end, more than three million inhabitants of Soviet Ukraine had died.

It forgets to mention: 

a) That independent of the way of calculation of the victims (statistics of deaths rarely use 'hunger' as the cause). Twice as many ethnic Russians died as Ukrainians.

b) The main reason for the hunger was bad harvest caused by drought. 

c) Once it was known about the hunger - aid was supplied. But in many cases too late (the hunger started in autumn 1932, but the aid started to arrive in spring 1933).

How did hunger happen? The government took the quotas for land use (which belonged to the state) in kind. The quotas were established based on the results of the cooperatives. 

Prior to the drought in summer 1932 already a strong black market for flour existed. The individual farmers who didn't join the cooperatives were incentived to hide most part of their harvest so they can quern it later and sell the flour in the black markets. 

The harvest of the cooperatives in 1932 was less affected by the drought because they had irrigation systems, pumps, tractors and other machinery. So that caused local governments to set unrealistic quotas for the local farmers — effectively taking away their food supply.

Individual farmers starved causing Soviet Union population loss between 5 and 7 million people. That fact led to investigation which finalized in 1939, the culprits of the mass starvation were the leaders of the Republics, among them (in case of Ukraine): [Stanislav Kosior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Kosior), [Pavel Postyshev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Postyshev) and [Vlas Chubar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlas_Chubar) — all executed.

Was the Soviet Government responsible of the deaths of millions in this case? Yes

Was it done on purpose to kill any specific group? No, at least there no facts that would sustain such affirmation.

I have read dozens of articles about that matter, the main argument I see in Ukrainian internet, is that number of Ukrainians in the census reduced, while number of Russians increased very much. Which is while true forgets to mention, that many of those who were censed as Ukrainians choose to be Russians, because of the Korenizatsiya program which imposed them to learn in Ukrainian (language that many of those who considered themselves Ukrainians didn't know). That is widely documented fact which is normally silenced in the modern Ukrainian propaganda. 

I also say that it is a propaganda peace, because it uses fact spinnings to place a sign of = between Soviet regime and Nazi Germany.
