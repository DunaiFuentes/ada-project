Forse si sentirà superiore al tuo blocco mentale che non ti fa voler accendere il cervello per quei 30 secondi, o più probabilmente si sentirà superiore perchè ti dice di non fare una cosa che continui a rifare costringendo lui a dover risistemare sempre le cose.

Detto questo, fai un uso estremamente limitato di ""informatico"", e a dire il vero io avevo parlato di gente che sa usare il computer, non che sa usare un cacciavite. Preciso comunque che io non faccio parte di questa categoria, che non pensi sia un difesa professionale, anzi io il cervello per quei 30 secondi lo accendo, così non ne ho proprio bisogno.
Mi sa comunque che è il tuo ad essere un complesso di inferiorità che si manifesta nella necessità di insultare per ribilanciare le cose, comportamento abbastanza tipico. Arriva il tecnico che deve sistemare le cose dopo che hai aperto un allegato da ""enlarge your penis"", sbuffa perchè lo avra fatto mille volte. Tu pensi, ma chi cazzo ti credi di essere...

Many things, like Coca Cola, Budweiser, Pepsi, and other major western goods are made in factories in Russia who are paid Russian wages. Because of the inflation, their wages won't go up so the prices won't go up so long as the product they're making has limited inputs from which are imported.

Ist halt Zizek: super sympathisch und nett (O-Ton eines Freundes: ""*wie ein onkel, der nur zum geschichtenerzählen und umarmen da is*""), aber immer unter Vorbehalt zu lesen. Trotzdem sehr interessant.

Schau mal in die [Antwort](http://www.zeit.de/2015/05/terrorismus-radikale-linke-antwort-slavoj-zizek) in der darauffolgenden Zeit rein.


&gt;Wie lächerlich es doch manchmal aussieht wenn sich zwei Gruppen gegenüber stehen die sich gegenseitig mit Utopien und gescheiterten Ideen bewerfen. 

Sowas in der Art denke Ich auch, wenngleich Ich nicht der Meinung bin, dass es Sinn macht das Links-Rechts-Schema zu verwerfen. Man muss sich nur im Klaren sein, dass das Links-Rechts-Schema schwammig definiert und daher quasi mindestens Zeit/Kultur-abhängig ist. Bei genauerer Analyse und Diskussion muss man eben zur nächstgelegeneren Theorieebene greifen.

Ich glaube, dass der Sozialismus insofern schon massive globale Probleme hat, als dass je globalisierter die Welt wird, die Nationen auch immer mehr kollektivistische/überstaatliche/zwischenstaatliche Elemente in die öffentliche Ordnung einbauen. Das relativiert zusammen mit der Sozialstaatlichkeit die Notwendigkeit/Daseinsberechtigung des Sozialismus. Ganz zu schweigen vom totalitären Sozialismus. Und wie Faschismus und andere konservativ-reaktionär-autokratische Gesellschaften untergingen ist auch hinreichend dokumentiert, darüber brauch man nicht zu diskutieren.

&gt;Ich kann auch heute nicht mehr sehen wie eine radikale Linke unsere ""zentralen Werte"" retten kann. Was sollen die überhaupt sein?

Diese Werte gibt es halt auch nicht wirklich. (Sie sind eher nicht in der Realität zu suchen, sondern in der Theorie.)

Der Sozialliberalismus  ist  die wackelige -da unterfinanzierte- Bühne auf der jeder spielt, zu der sich aber nicht jeder bekennen muss, um auf ihr zu spielen.

Die ""zentralen Werte"" des Sozialliberalismus (=/=wirtschaftlicher Liberalismus zu verstehen) sind unterbewusste, pseudo-konsensuale, gesellschaftliche Exkpunkte. Sie sind Subjekt der Umdeutung und Dehnung/Relativierung der gerade herrschenden politischen Fragmente.

Der Sozialliberalismus könnte also dann ein Problem mit der Selbsterhaltung haben, wenn politische Fragmente damit beschäftigt sind, sich gegenseitig zu bekämpfen, statt die Grundlage ihrer ganzen Existenz -eine sozialliberale Gesellschaft als ""Forum"" ihrer Konfrontation- zu schützen. Der unsichere, differenzierende, pragmatische Sozialliberalismus liefe Gefahr im Getöse der Ideologen und Schreihälse unterzugehen. Hatte [hier](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/01/liberals-and-the-illiberal-left/384988/) letztens ein paar Abschnitte gelesen, die das gut veranschaulichen.

&gt;Das Paradox ist, dass der Liberalismus selbst nicht stark genug ist, um sie vor dem fundamentalistischen Ansturm zu schützen. Der Fundamentalismus ist eine Reaktion – eine falsche, mystifizierende Reaktion natürlich – auf einen echten Makel des Liberalismus, und deshalb wird er immer wieder aufs Neue vom Liberalismus hervorgebracht.

Zizeks Prämisse finde Ich so richtig, nicht aber die Analyse des Fundamentalismus als Reaktion auf Liberalismus. Es gab Fundamentalismus schon vor (also ohne) Liberalismus, man muss da keine Zwangsverknüpfung ziehen. Viel eher würde Ich vielleicht den Liberalismus als nur schwach durchsetzungsfähige Reaktion auf Fundamentalismus und Ideologie sehen.

Daher ist die Aussage, dass eine Radikale Linke nun die Lösung sein, imho ebenfalls verfehlt. Sie würde sich genau wie die anderen Teilnehmer im politischen Spiel die Definitionsherrschaft über die sozialliberale Gesellschaftsordnung zu eigen machen, was auf Kosten der anderen Kompromisspartner und des Sozialiberalismus an sich gehen würde. Wie soll dem Liberalismus durch dessen Relativierung (nur diesmal von links, statt durch das bürgerliche Lager) geholfen sein? Auch hier würde schlussendlich also sozialer Unfrieden in Form von Polarisierung vorhanden sein.

Die Rechnung Zizeks ist an der Stelle also fehlerhaft: Er möchte suggerieren, dass gesamtgesellschaftliches Revolutionspotential hier von einer Radikalen Linken getilgt werden kann. Konterrevolutionärer Widerstand durch konträre Lager kommt ihm gar nicht in den Sinn.

Ob man hier frei nach Metallica Feuer mit Feuer bekämpfen sollte halte Ich deswegen für äußerst fragwürdig. Ich glaube, man bräuchte einfach mehr ""überzeugte"" Liberale, Sozialliberale, Linksliberale die den Grad an Reformismus vorantreiben - und weniger Ideologen, Funktionäre und Emporkömmlinge. Menschen denen was an Erkenntnis und Dialektik liegt.

Wenn man also schon in Zizeks Richtung denkt, müsste etwas anderes her: ein steigender linker -aber liberaler-, eifrig-kritischer Reformismus. Das würde schon eher passen - im Gegensatz zu zum Reformismus unfähigen/unwilligen revolutionären Kräften.",null,0,null,1423600221,null,0,false,0,cohd982,null,t3_2vfim4,null,t1_cohd982,null,t1_coh9rtv,null,null,null,null,null,2,false,de,t5_22i0,2,null

'Hochschätzen' in the second sentence is ""to venerate"".

'Große Stücke auf jemanden halten' is an idiom meaning 'to have a high opinion  of someone'. Literally it means holding big pieces on/onto someone; supposedly that comes from gambling where big/large pieces meant 'a lot of money'.

(Also ""derart"" means 'of that kind'/'like that'/'such'. ""Dergestalt"" is 'of that form'/'in that way'/'such'.)",null,0,null,1423600545,null,0,false,0,cohdgrq,null,t3_2vg99w,null,t1_cohdgrq,null,t3_2vg99w,null,null,null,null,null,3,false,German,t5_2qq51,3,null

The well-known sub initially started for a reason and that reason was not adorable Poland being silly, it was Germans making fun of you en masse (i'm talking about Krautchan origins mostly). 


Poles/Eastern Europeans/Baltics all carry their ""correct version of history"", under which they think they suffered greatly because of Evil Russia, who is out to get them, kill them all or subjugate them. 


Your ""views"" are consistent for about 25 years already and took root in your subconscious, a lot of your independence movement was based on freeing yourself from Soviet Union (which is fine), but when you achieved independence your stance has not changed and continue to be generally Russophobic to an extent. 


Western academics also make fun of Polish historians from time to time or any other Former Soviet Bloc countries, because when nations ""explain"" their history to their population, they always try to portray themselves as borderline saint and the other guys as ""Literally Hitler"". Its nothing new obviously, almost every single nation on earth is guilty of rewriting history or ""changing the narrative"" and outright ignoring wrongdoings of previous generations (or decisions that may have led to your countries demise).


I have no idea about internal political climate in Poland or any other former Soviet bloc country and honestly i don't care, but i do observe here on this sub a certain ""Eastern European bias"" if you can call it that. It usually involves something along the lines of ""Russians are evil, they should pay reparations for our occupation and repent on their knees + give back *insert what was lost during the decades*"". 


There are plenty of comments from former Soviet bloc along the lines of ""Russia should die or dissolve"" as well. 


Thats only my personal view of things ofc, you are free to disagree or think that i'm a ""stupid Russkie smell, go back to drinking Vodka and praise Putin/Stalin"".


Going back to Tusk, it doesn't matter what title he is holding now, if Moscow says it will only talk with people who they consider as ""running things in Europe"" (or holding enough political and economical influence), they are either going to get what they want or there would be no dialogue at all. 


Polish-Russian relations were going downhill for a while now so its not surprising for me that Moscow is not interested in negotiations with ""former PM"" (sure, he might have changed the skin as a snake and became  a ""clean sheet"", but somehow i doubt it, i think he still holds Poland close to his heart and given the opportunity, he might act more in Polish/Eastern European interests,rather than EU as a whole).


In any case, this is the case when its Kremlin deciding who he wants to talk with, not Brussel/Warsaw/Berlin/Paris, as simple as that.

That's often referred to as the ""social contract"" in that banks are expected to provide this to society and that is pretty much why we bail them out in the first.

thing is ""QE"" was implemented to solve the liquidity problem where banks were unwilling to lend to each other as nobody trusted the solvency of the bank they were lending however it's now gone to the other extreme where money is so cheap (0% rates from central banks) they really just don't want to bother with consumers and treat it as a burden. 

I don't know how it is where you live but where I am it's getting obvious banks don't  want to deal with customers at all, If you want to make any sort of transaction in a branch now or even lodge cash it will cost you €2.50 service fee.

Some say banks want to introduce negative interest rates where they charge you to hold money but are just afraid of the backlash to be the first to do it. 

&gt;To me that's a perversion of banking. That's different from the classic model of lender-borrower where both sides bear risk and therefore share a common interest to succeed.

null,false,10ebbor10,null,null,null,"&gt;Thorium reactors problem is that those don't produce nukes thus why Uranium was chosen instead of easily available thorium and historically any country that has nuclear reactor has nukes or nukes capability.

This is completely false.

First off, nuclear power reactors are completely unsuited to the production of weapons grade nuclear material. In order to get plutonium, you need high burn-up with rapid refueling.

Now, a nuclear power plant works best with year long fuel cycles, and operating at different enrichment levels than those required for nuclear weapon development. Plutonium created from nuclear power production will be contaminated.

Attempts to combine nuclear power and nuclear weaponry have consistently failed. The Magnox from the UK can't perform the originally planned online refueling. The Soviet RBMK, well, that is self explinatory.

Why would you build an expensive, and large nuclear power plant when you could much easier build a small research power plant dedicated to weaponry production.

The reason that thorium wasn't chosen is that thorium is not fissile thus requiring a breeder reactor. Breeder reactors, which are harder to design than conventional power plants.

&gt;China because having reactor with fuel common as dirt

Thorium is about as abundant than uranium, though reserves of both are large. It's fuel advantage is a benefit from breeding technology, which can just as easily be deployed on uranium.

&gt;no possibility of an explosion (no hydrogen), 

A benefit of the metallic/molten salt coolant. No reason that this can't be used on Uranium.

&gt;and redioctivity which last just 300 years instead of thousands 

A benefit from the Fast reactor technology, not intrinsic to thorium.

Sans compter que j'avais du mal à me mettre à chercher à fond les soirs et week-ends. J'ai démissionné un peu pour me mettre un coup de pied au fesses aussi. Et un jour je suis tombé sur l'offre de service civique qui s'est imposée à moi. J'ai écrit la lettre de motivation la plus sincère et spontanée sur le coup. 

La reprise des cours n'était pas possible parce que 1) je ne pouvais pas financièrement me permettre de passer plus d'un an sans salaire (et qu'il y a peu de formations de moins de 2 ans) et 2) Je ne pouvais pas me permettre de ne rien gagner du tout. L'indemnité de service civique était de 500€/mois, ce qui est mieux que 0.

For example if a product isn't available they are kind of obliged to help you buy it (I don't know the exact rules). The opening hours are not good, but it is not too bad either and you get used to it.

Since Systembolaget buys huge quantities of alcohol they can actually press the prices quite a bit. For example I noticed in australia that some australian wines are more expensive there than at home. 
Unless you buy booze or are truly looking for east european prices they are not too expensive by my standards. Although admittedly I go to Germany (sry Denmark) from time to time to stock up on beer, it's barely worth it for me, well maybe if I really know that a huge party is coming up or you need to buy alot of booze for some reason. You can also bring in huge quantities at once, I personally have brought in twice the ""recommended"" amount without the border guards even flinching. People often get caught overloading their cars though.

Naturally I drink more beer if I have it at home than if I don't. I am a bit lazy and often don't find a need to go to Systembolaget unless I'm inviting someone over for dinner, going to a party etc.

Would I want to get rid Systembolagets alcohol monopoly? Well maybe, I just can't see them be competitive on an open market without making their service worse and l like their current service. I also think that the alcohol consumption would rise, swedes (including my self) drink to get drunk.

&gt; Blaming the government that you voted in is just stupid.

People will always blame the government for the bad things in the society.

&gt; Most people don't care enough about immigration or clearly want current policies to continue.

Because they don't really know the reality of it. I still meet people in everyday life who seriously believe that immigrants are big profit to the society. A lot of Swedes still doesn't know that we take in nearly 1% of our total population and more Swedes don't know why that's a problem.

Since media is so pro-immigration a big portion of the population never hear about the negative aspects and never hear about the discussions regarding it. They hear that SD wants to ""cut immigration by 90%"" and how that's bad because ""Sweden has always relied on immigration for its growth"".

What exactly do you mean ""clearly want current policies to continue""? According to polls 40% wants to reduce the levels. This is not in any way reflected in the riksdag. You can't assume that ""only 13% wants to reduce the levels because SD got 13%"". The ""we are 87%"" is bullshit and deceiving all the way through the core.

Ist das nicht noch mehr ein Argument dafür, dass das Schema einfach nur überholt ist? Welchen Zweck erfüllt es denn da noch? Es wirkt als bräuchte man das um sich von der jeweiligen Seite abzugrenzen. Man ist dann irgendwie unrechts oder unlinks. 

&gt; Der unsichere, differenzierende, pragmatische Sozialliberalismus liefe Gefahr im Getöse der Ideologen und Schreihälse unterzugehen.

Das ist natürlich absehbar. Das ist aber die gleiche Diskussion die man gelegentlich bei der Demokratie führt. Zum Beispiel wenn es um Ungarn geht. Ich fürchte da führt auch kein Weg daran vorbei. Wahrscheinlich ist der Liberalismus sogar die Frucht des Konfliktes. Der Konflikt ist auf der einen Seite eine Abschreckung auf der anderen aber auch ein Vorteil. Eine aktive Vielfalt an Meinungen und Ideen sowie ein offener und freier Diskurs würden das Gesamtsystem am Ende nur stärker machen. Und wem würde man es mehr zutrauen vernünftige Entscheidungen zu treffen als den Menschen die es geschafft haben das L/R-Schema hinter sich zu lassen?

Das war meine Monatsdosis Optimismus.

Ich kann dem Rest nur zustimmen. Ich habe das Gefühl als hätte er teilweise versucht das Fazit zu rechtfertigen. Ich würde ihn gerne mit der Kritik konfrontieren aber irgendwie glaube ich seine Kontaktadresse wird in der nächsten Zeit ziemlich überladen sein.

Der Atlantics Artikel war auch interessant. In den USA liegt ja der Konflikt praktisch auf dem Tablett. Das interessante ist, daß dort praktisch kein Platz für eine dritte Partei ist die einfach nur linker oder rechter wäre als das was die etablierten Parteien abdecken. Somit ist die einzige fruchtbare nationale Diskussion über eine dritte Partei, die über eine Alternative zu den beiden die schon da sind.

null,false,SnobbyEuropean,EURO,European Union,null,"Now, let me get this straight, since you obviously don't understand my point.


What I said, is that I have no respect for mass murderers, no matter their achievements. What I also said, is that we should stop heroizing said mass murderers.


What I didn't say a damn word about is the legitimacy of the poll (which you were happy to bring up, declaring me an idiot, despite me never even fucking mentioning the poll itself.)


What I *did* say, is that Ukraine will eventually fall, but it won't affect Europe, and as long as we defend our borders, Russia can be repelled if they don't use nukes. Then you, again, brought up Ukraine, comparing Donetsk to Ossetia. Irrelevant. Not the original subject. We both know that Ukraine will fall, yet, you manage to keep their situation in the conversation, even though our conclusions are the same: Ukraine falls.


And now, for the Xth time, I repeat, I'm not a ""legalist"", and I despise those who *are* legalists in radical situations, effectively siding with mass murderers. This is a question of belief and morals, not of facts. Knowing that a certain percentage of Russians are legalists won't change my views. Stating your own views is not an argument either, but an interesting subject to converse about, given that the conversational partner doesn't act like a condescending dick. To me, a mass murderer can't be a ""good man"" or someone useful for society. To you, they *can* be. Also, I have no fucking idea why you think that I'm mirroring the views of the ""western elite"". These are my own opinions, not someone else's. I don't represent anyone besides myself, and to me, this was obvious.


About literacy... Again, you managed to completely misunderstand my point. I didn't say that there weren't any intellectuals in the Soviet Union, or that they couldn't keep up with the west in technology. Nothing like that. I meant that someone that heroizes a cruel dictator is still a barbarian to me, no matter his or her education.



About Russian economics, which again, you brought up as a response to my ""Russia is not in a better position than Europe"" comment: I still hold my opinion, according to which, I repeat, Russia is not in a better position than Europe. Their economy is not divided enough, and if they continue to act like a bully, chances are, they will lose more income from their #1 trading partner, the European Union. The current situation costs more to Russia than it costs to the EU.


In ""short"", I was arguing about morals, while you were trying to counter with facts irrelevant to the conversation. I responded to the things you brought up, then you brought up even more irrelevant subjects, such as the legitimacy of the poll, and called me a retard.  Instead of answering with actually relevant answers to my arguments, you simply glided over them. One of these is the (not so) rhetorical question:


&gt; Committing war crimes such as the Katyn massacre, cruel oppression of captured territories, ""disappearences"", executions, rape, torture, and every other cruel shit Stalin is responsible for must have helped the war effort, right?


In the end, we are arguing about completely different things. I'm arguing against legalism and the heroization of dictators, while you keep coming up with new subjects that are brought into the conversation, to which I respond, then again, you come up with new subjects, until you can finally wheel the conversation to things that are part of your trade, such as data analysis, in which your knowledge is obviously superior, since *it is your trade*, while my knowledge is basic at best. From morals -&gt; economics. You catch my drift, right?


This is like arguing with a 10 year old who refuses to pack up the match with a tie in a conversation about something entirely subjective:


""I like banana""

""I don't. I like apples.""

If we have to weight one essential right against another, it should be measured, effective, and most of all subject to public discussion so we can make an informed decision. Clearly, this has not been the case here.

It isn't simply smart individuals, it was the system that developed them and produced them. Ever wonder why most great chess players come from the former Eastern Bloc? Is it just because they're smart? 

&gt;Life expectancy

Life expectancy in Russia actually dropped after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and reached its lowest levels during the reign of the drunk clown Yeltsin. But Yeltsin was a good guy who cared about the Russian people, according to the West.

True. But before we have a designated vote for that we can assume that people are fine with the ideas that current parties have.

&gt; Because they don't really know the reality of it. I still meet people in everyday life who seriously believe that immigrants are big profit to the society. A lot of Swedes still doesn't know that we take in nearly 1% of our total population and more Swedes don't know why that's a problem.
Since media is so pro-immigration a big portion of the population never hear about the negative aspects and never hear about the discussions regarding it. They hear that SD wants to ""cut immigration by 90%"" and how that's bad because ""Sweden has always relied on immigration for its growth"".

you make a good point, but its your job to ""educate"" people that you deem to have the wrong idea if you want people to vote for the ""right"" thing. Or if you have a party that has close enough opinions to your own, you can aid them or just leave it be if you don't care.

&gt; What exactly do you mean ""clearly want current policies to continue""? According to polls 40% wants to reduce the levels. This is not in any way reflected in the riksdag. You can't assume that ""only 13% wants to reduce the levels because SD got 13%"". The ""we are 87%"" is bullshit and deceiving all the way through the core.

that was part of the same sentence as ""don't care enough"". What I mean with that is that clearly people sees other issues as more important and is fine their parties policies. Correct me if I am wrong but I think immigration is seen as third most important issue.

edit: seems like it is second now, however S is considered having the best policy

secondo me, esattamente come per le serie, c'è una confusione di fondo. 

da un lato il riciclo della critica postmoderna anni 90 dei prodotti masscult (o popolari o trash che dir si voglia), divertente eh, per le prime tre volte e soprattutto quando la faceva gente con i controcazzi, non quitthedoner. dall'altro il tentativo popolare di legittimazione dei prodotti che apprezzano (niente di nuovo, lo dice genette che l'apprezzamento estetico è costitutivamente oggettivista e che non può rinunciare ai predicati senza pregiudicare se stesso). 

sarebbe cosa buona e giusta però che la gente si mettesse il cuore in pace e ammettesse liberamente che certa letteratura/prodotti televisivi vengono fruiti per evasione, divertimento, senza cercare di appioppargli dignità culturali che non hanno. dio mio il prossimo che senso parlare di the wire o breaking bad e turgenev mi riservo di mandarlo a fare nel culo

Pensate alla legalizzazione del gioco d'azzardo che **grazie all'automazione** è diventata un male peggiore del gioco d'azzardo illegale, dato che raccoglie più di 60 miliardi l'anno, ma causa ludopatie e riduce sul lastrico molta più gente, proprio perché è effettuata su scala -industriale. L'indotto del gioco d'azzardo è costituito da quattro gatti, poche migliaia di persone e una minoranza prendere il grosso del bottino. Per me si potrebbe chiudere domani o, come minimo, va negata la possibilità di effettuare alcun tipo di pubblicità. Più complesso il problema del gioco online, ma non impossibile da ridurre al lumicino.

Di conseguenza, bisogna riflettere sui rischi connessi alla legalizzazione della prostituzione. Esiste un rischio connesso alla sua ""industrializzazione""? Io non credo che esista, in quanto sono rarissime le donne che vogliono prostituirsi, mentre sono molto più numerose le donne (ma anche transgender e probabilmente anche degli omosessuali) che sono _costrette_ a prostituirsi e che vengono sfruttate da magnaccia e personaggi che fanno di tutto per apparire dei rispettabili professionisti, ma che in fondo sempre magnaccia pettinati sono.

Dunque, non essendoci la possibilità di una dimensione industriale, l'istituzione di ""case chiuse"" gestite esclusivamente da prostitute (penso alle ex-prostitute che smettono di esercitare) e con chiarissime e ferrea regolamentazione potrebbe aiutare a ridurre la domanda per la prostituzione illegale, perché renderebbe quella legale meno rischiosa per i clienti e più controllata.

Long answer: 

- Austerity is easy to enforce, just raise taxes and wait.

- You need 2/3 of parliament on board to do serious reforms. 

- The idea of a coalition between the major parties is very unpopular and likely damaging for both.

- There are corporate and oligarch interests in keeping the status quo.

Je faisais pas grand chose, mais ce genre de détente pure après avoir bossé non-stop m'a détendu comme jamais.

Puis finalement, je suis tombé sur [cette vidéo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr1pFnJj6H0) qui parodie Les Dents de la Mer.

C'est nul quand on la voit comme ça, mais épuisé comme je l'étais et avec l'état d'esprit que j'avais, avec le cerveau complètement bousillé par la semaine de travail intensif, j'ai explosé de rire devant la vidéo. Mes deux colocataires sont rentrés dans ma chambre pour voir pourquoi je hurlais de rire et ont trouvé la vidéo complètement nulle, mais moi je me roulais par terre pendant qu'ils la repassaient. J'avais du mal à respirer tellement je riais.

No. There wasn't a public uprising on wether we should use nuclear power or join the EU, but the polls were issued anyway.

&gt; you make a good point, but its your job to ""educate"" people that you deem to have the wrong idea if you want people to vote for the ""right"" thing.

Media has credibility which I lack. Even if I told the truth people would just reference to said media as proof that I am wrong.

&gt; Or if you have a party that has close enough opinions to your own, you can aid them or just leave it be if you don't care.

I don't really care what opinions people have when it comes to economics and certain areas of politics. I am friends with both communists and capitalists and they both make valuable points. What I dislike is stubbornness of misinformation and trying to justify things that doesn't make any sense.

&gt; What I mean with that is that clearly people sees other issues as more important and is fine their parties policies.

A lot of people are scared to vote for SD because of social outlook on them, mainly because of SD nazi past. It's also difficult to ignore SDs right-winged economic politics and religious tendencies. If a leftie wants reduced immigration he can't really vote for SD because he's against all of their economic politics. Saying ""people see other issues as more important"" would be dishonest because in reality it's ""people see all of the other issues together as more important than immigration alone"".

&gt; Correct me if I am wrong but I think immigration is seen as third most important issue.

Not sure. Obviously at least 13% prioritise it very highly.

Das ist sogar volkommen unnütz, denn mit solchen Systemen wird heute nichts gemacht (auch damals schon nicht.) Man nimmt große statistische Modelle, und Corpora im mehrstelligen Gigabyte-Bereich (Google kann auch TB.)

Schau, ""von oben herab"" redest Du hier über etwas wovon Du offensichtlich nicht viel weißt. Was Du hier beschreibst ist *Spracherkennung*. Text-to-speech.

Well, I am really tiered, but you can check the facts if you want, I am to tiered to link the sources, here is in short: He says there is no continuity between medieval Serbian state and modern Serbian state, which is invalid argument. Even more ridiculous, as he is historian, is comparing that to Byzantine empire and Greece, it just doesn't make any sense. Then he says that first Serbian state from 7th century was outside of Kosovo, which is again invalid. Then he says that Kosovo was not incorporated into Serbian state, but in Yugoslav state, which is switching of the facts, technically true, but it did as part of Serbia, not as an independent unit. Then he says Yugoslavia had basically 8 federal units and that Kosovo had a status of federal unit, which again is not true. Yugoslavia had 6 federal units, Serbia had 2 autonomous provinces Kosovo and Vojvodina. These provinces had their self governing bodies, but they never had a status of a federal unit (unlike Croatia, Bosnia etc.), they were always integral part of Serbia by Yugoslavian constitution...

&gt; It's not even logical to use immigration as an argument when your population especially in that region has always been prone to immigration for political and economical reasons .

Sure those are invalid arguments. Even history has nothing to do with this, one thing from 200 years ago can't justify another thing that happened yesterday etc. These are all silly arguments, that are not helpful to anyone at all.

I've had a quick look around google to see if any of the usual [travel info/etiquette](http://www.young-germany.de/topic/live/settle-in-adjust/a-guide-to-german-etiquette) stuff might be beneficial - here are some points that I find might be helpful for your stay - *italics* are my comments on those items:

- **Shaking hands:** Germans are great hand-shakers, and they like to do so both when arriving and when departing. It is common for a person who is joining a group to shake hands with every single individual. *(pro tip - at any first meeting or when meeting an elder/teacher/boss/parent, AVOID at all cost having your other hand in your pocket during a handshake - this is acceptable in the US and sometimes even a sign by the ""pocketer"", especially when of higher social status (boss, elder), that they are relaxed and casual. A German with a decent upbringing will most likely not be able to point out what exactly just felt strange during that interaction, but will still be subconciously rankled, as keeping your free hand in your pocket is extremely rude/sends the message that you consider your opposite number so inconsequential that they are not worth a ""proper greeting"". Have your left hand losely hang beside your body while shaking with your right, you may stuff it back into your pocket after shaking hands)*
 
- **Drinking:** Beer and wine are part of a normal dinner and alcoholic drinks are usually offered to guests. Not drinking, however, is completely accepted. Do not insist on alcoholic drinks if a person has rejected your initial offer and don’t order them for them. A German who rejects a drink is not just being shy or polite but does not want to drink. For some cultures it is uncommon to see teenagers order a beer at restaurants and pubs. Remember that the legal drinking age in Germany is 16 for beer and wine and 18 for spirits.
 

- **Punctuality:** Don’t turn up late for an appointment or when meeting people. Germans are extremely punctual, and even a few minutes’ delay can offend. Be five to 10 minutes early for important appointments and be sure to call the people you are meeting if you really cannot make it in time.

- **Flowers:** *(applies mostly to parents/tutors etc. do this and you'll leave a very good first impression)* Bring flowers if you’re invited to a German home for some social occasion. If the flowers are wrapped in paper, remember to take off the wrapping just before you enter the home.
 
- **Garbage:** *(super important - especially elderly passers-by who catch you getting this wrong in front of the garbage bin outside WILL yell at you for this)* Germans are extremely environmentally conscious and separate their garbage to facilitate recycling. If your neighbors spot you throwing recyclable glass or paper into the regular garbage, your relationship could be strained for good.

- **Closed doors:** Germans enjoy quietness and privacy. They may thus often close their doors but will be happy to receive you if you knock on the door. A closed door doesn’t necessarily mean that the person cannot be disturbed. Likewise a closed bathroom door in somebody’s house does not mean the bathroom is occupied.

- **Telephoning:** *(this applies mostly to landlines)*Don’t call people at home after 10 p.m. unless you’ve asked them first if it’s all right. Don’t expect to reach anyone in the office after 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday and after 4 p.m. on Fridays. When answering the phone in Germany, it is common to identify yourself with your last name. 

- **Greetings:** When customers enter shops *(in smaller cities or somewhere you'd be going regularily)*, especially smaller outlets, they greet everyone in the shop. The same is true of doctors’ waiting rooms. So practice saying ""Guten Tag"" and ""Auf Wiedersehen.""




A few extra things off the top of my head:

- **carry cash**, pretty much everywhere - you may be able to pay with a German/European debit card (Maestro) but very few places, usually only the very large chain stores and gas stations accept credit card. Discounters (Aldi, Lidl, Penny, Netto) DO NOT accept credit cards. That goes for even the big cities tike Stuttgart, Munich, Berlin and Hamburg.

- **Germans do smalltalk differently**: when a German asks you how you are, and especially when YOU ask a German how they are, you will get a full, honest answer. you WILL hear about people's colds, annoyances and so on. inconsequential small talk (weather etc.) isn't really done here. On the other hand, having a general idea of history and keeping up with current events/news is a sign of a decent upbringing and education in Germany. People will want to demonstrate their interest in you as a person and your home country by engaging you in talk about it. They especially WILL provide their opinion on matters such as the wars in Iraq/Afghanistan, the global Debt Crisis, the ""NSA-Scandal"" (US intelligence services spying on Germany) and expect you to have an opinion on these matters, regardless of your position. They WILL  also debate you on all these matters - do not be offended, Germans are incredibly direct in that regard. Remind them that you are not responsible for your government, it is also perfectly okay to bow out of a discussion by saying ""I'm sorry, I don't feel I have enough profound knowledge on the topic to discuss this with you at this point"" - they'll let you off the hook. The redeeming aspect is: this goes both ways. Express you opinions freely (facts to back your arguments are always a plus), even when they are negative. Don't concede a point just because your opinion differs. Germans will take you at face value and though they may debate you if they strongly disagree, in the end, they will respect your right to your own opinion. They will also discuss WWII and the Holocaust with you if that is a topic you are interested in. Due to compulsory in-depth education on the matter, they tend to be pretty knowledgeable. IMPORTANT: Do not negate or deny the existence of the Holocaust - even if you only want to try it once to see the look on people's faces. Holocaust Denial constitutes a crime in Germany.  

- **take your shoes off indoors**: this goes for most private homes

- **water in restaurants is almost never complementary**: ask specifically for tap water, otherwise be prepared to have to pay for it. Also, the ""default water"" in Germany is seltzer. I you don't want sparkling water, make sure you order ""still"" water. Also: no free refills. Oh, and if you want ice, ask for it.


- **look people in the eye when you clink glasses/ toast**: lovely little custom here. further table etiquette: Don't start eating until everyone is served, do not expect any praying, don't leave the table/start moving empty dishes off until everyone is finished with their meal. 

- **never wish anyone an early Happy Birthday**: congratulations in advance are considered to invoke bad luck. Belated congratualtions are totally fine, however.

- **driving**: when there are speed limits *STICK TO THEM* - speed traps, both fixed and mobile, tend to be everywhere and fines get very nasty very quickly. The natives know where to expect them and drive accordingly - you will not be there long enough to figure it out. On the Autobahn, drive AS FAR ON THE RIGHT as is prudent regarding your own speed (pick the lane where you can maintain the speed you want without constantly having to overtake slower drivers) - passing is ONLY on the left. A word of caution as a seasoned, fast driver myself: Fast drivers have a tendency to drive very fast and very aggressively - they will close in very quickly with lights flashing and have little patience for you clearing the way once they are behind you. They generally drive high-power cars, (think they) know what they are doing and don't 'f'uck around. On all roads, everywhere: adjust your speed according to weather conditions - that goes especially for Autobahn stretches with no speed limit!

For the US, there was tens of billions in the stimulus package that went directly to bail out state governments, primarily in the areas of health care and education.  

Can actually get really interesting depending how cynical you are.  I mean, the main government health care program at the time for low income citizens was medicaid.  The ARRA gave almost $90 billion to the states to cover medicaid costs and programs.

Now, did they give all this money because they thought it was the best way to fix the economy as opposed to spending more on infrastructure improvements or job training? Maybe.

It's little wonder since White women are highly desirable and beautiful that cultures where beauty is extremely rare would be jealous of their beauty and desirability and call them sluts and whores. This is obviously true because of the intense desire that non-White men have for White women. While the desire of White men for non-White women is almost non-existent (except for East Asian women of course). There are rare cases of very beautiful non-White women but that is dwarfed by the vast majority of very ugly women. Very beautiful non-White women usually end up marrying White men anyway. 

There is such a significantly lower demand for non-White women. Honestly, I don't find them at all attractive. While there are some very beautiful women who are from those backgrounds they are extremely rare to find and when you do find them they are usually mixed with some White or East Asian ancestry. The vast majority of non-White women are very ugly and therefore very little desire for them exists and so are not thought of as sluts because no one really cares whether they are sexual or not. For example, Black women are very promiscuous but who cares? When was the last time you ever thought a Black or Arab women was desirable? I don't even think about them at all. I don't want a woman who is darker than me or has more and thicker body hair.

Only White or East Asian women are desirable to me. There is the rare case of a beautiful Persian women or Hindu, but they usually have a high percentage of Indo-European blood. 

Also, non-White women live in very repressive misogynous cultures which are afraid of female sexuality and power and seek to dominate and repress women. I would rather live in a culture that allows women to be powerful members of society in control of and helping to shape that society. This freedom and empowerment may result in other cultures labeling them as whores, but I really don't give a shit what ugly people think anyway.",null,0,null,1423608896,null,0,1423610523,0,cohiugx,null,t3_2vbgvj,null,t1_cohiugx,null,t1_coh614a,null,null,null,null,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

In that case, I definitely would like to see a link.  Guy is smart as hell, but his columns frequently are more geared towards influencing public opinion than taking a serious hard look at the situation.

&gt;Anyway this figure was basically the 2010 budget deficit.

But there is much more to it than that.  If that is what he based his claims on, then you probably shouldn't buy into it.

A mean, based only on the budget deficit, Greece shouldn't need *any* money right now since they are running a surplus, yet they are still requesting a bridge loan and a refinancing of their current debt.

Typically, covering maturing bonds and the like aren't carried on most budgets.  Instead, they assume that they can just roll the debt over into new loans or bonds, which wasn't really possible in 2010.

If Krugman ignored that, you should probably question if he was being purposely dishonest.

&gt;The actual bailout plan that the EU went with is around 110B, most of it being spent on paying back interests, reimbursing lenders by privatizing and dramatic cuts all around.

Yeah but you are comparing apples to oranges.  You are comparing a number from Krugman that doesn't see to actually count the debt payments that couldn't be rolled over. 

Also, I think you have it backwards when you say ""reimbursing lenders by privatizing"".

My recollection is that they paid off the Greek debt to private lenders and allowed greece to refinance at very favorable rates while putting the *public* on the hook if Greece defaults.

You can argue if that is a good idea or not, but I don't think it counts as privatization.

&gt; Hmm, well, I guess, but I've seen the US HQ at Baghdad being referred to quite often as 'the HQ'. I see your point though.

Regardless of whether somebody knows the geography of Iraq or Ukraine, the two meanings are slightly different.  ""*The* headquarters"" is singular, therefore it implies though does not explicitly mean that it is the ultimate HQ of the organization.  Whether or not the singular headquarters is understood to be the overall HQ or a sub-HQ is going to depend on the rest of the context of the sentence.

There can be many headquarters in an organization (medical headquarters, regional headquarters, corporate headquarters, tactical headquarters, etc.) but there is generally only one (or few) headquarters of the organization itself.  It's not wrong, but it is ambiguous without further qualification, to describe the US HQ in Baghdad as ""the HQ"".  Because Baghdad and the US Army are well known internationally it's understood that this means the HQ for units in Baghdad or as a metonym the HQ in Iraq or even a larger part of the Middle East.

We all know that US Army is implicitly headquartered somewhere in the United States and most people will be aware that it is explicitly headquartered in the Pentagon, but if you were to say that Baghdad is ""the HQ of the US Army"" without any further qualification it could be confusing and somebody would likely point out that this is incorrect and that the US Army is headquartered in Arlington County, Virginia, that Central Command is headquartered in Tampa, Florida and that the HQ in Baghdad is the local HQ.  This would be necessary because it would be syntactically correct (if a bit nonsensical) to believe that the US Army had moved it's headquarters from Washington to Baghdad.

&gt; Kramatorsk airport hosts the HQ of the Ukrainian army

However, that sentence specifically stated that it was the HQ of the Ukrainian Army and for people who are not familiar with Ukrainian geography in general or the current events it would strongly suggest the latter ambiguous definition of what the HQ was.  In this case it's especially confusing if you know that Kramatorsk is in Ukraine because it's not completely unreasonable to assume that the entire army might be headquartered there unless you have some regional knowledge and are up-to-date on current events.  The correct way of saying this would be to say that it is ""*a* HQ of the Ukrainian Army"" or better yet as /u/vityok said to just be specific about which unit is headquartered there.

It's a fine point and one that most people, native English speakers included, would usually overlook unless genuinely confused, but he is technically correct or at least unambiguous,  [the best kind of correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo)!

The authors reported the following conclusion:
Overall, no increase in risk of glioma or meningioma was observed with use of mobile phones. There were suggestions of an increased risk of glioma at the highest exposure levels, but biases and error prevent a causal interpretation. The possible effects of long-term heavy use of mobile phones require further investigation.

Eine False-Flag Aktion der auf reddit ja schon hinreichend bekannten Staatstrolle Wladimir Wladimirowitschs?

&gt;Medical analysis of millions of post-9/11 New York cancer patients; 9/11 first respondents, firefighters, rescue workers, cleanup crew, residents, commuters and especially Wall Street brokers, indicate that 9/11 attack was a nuclear event. This indication was emphasized by Russian Intelligence leaks claiming that dirty nuclear bombs were used by nuclear capable Israeli Mossad, rather than by primitive cave dweller Osama bin Laden, to vaporize the Twin Trade Towers. 

&gt;Russian intelligence sources had recently leaked reports and massive documentation supporting the indication that 9/11 attack was a premeditated nuclear terror attack perpetrated by Israeli Mossad to spread Islamophobia in the hearts of Western countries and to push the American military to wage Israel’s proxy wars against Moslem Middle Eastern countries such as Iraq, Syria and Iran.

Except Harvard, Stanford, Caltech, UCLA, Berkley, Columbia, MIT, Georgetown, and a few others, american universities now depend on donors.

This is infuriatingly ignorant. Of that list, only the Cal schools are funded by the government directly, the others are private schools (although they receive public research dollars). The Koch Brothers donated ""Tens of Millions of dollars"" to universities, mostly the University of Kansas. That pales in comparison to the annual amount that universities spend and receive.

There are 84 universities that currently have endowments (liquid savings) of 1 Billion USD or more.

I have read several very funny stories. The vice-president of the previous government claimed he had forgotten it in his desk and just never thought to check it again. Their finance minister may have ""accidentally"" removed one of his relatives from the list and so on.

I think you're framing it interestingly. From my communication with greeks I know, I know that their major beef is that their previous governments literally administered policy prescriptions as they received them in emails. So their immediate concern is actually taking back control of policy-making within Greece. Other than that, fighting tax-evasion has never been something they were against, in fact the idea is popular there. That's not where the conflict is at. In fact they are pegging all their hopes at that being the common ground that will allow an agreement between them and the EU to be reached, because they know that to some extent the EZ also wants that to be done. The framing of the subject is very interesting. For greeks what's of paramount importance is reclaiming their internal sovereignty, however european media communicate that their primary interest is debt reduction. It's not that that's not on the table in one way or other, it's that they would likely not care about a complete retreat on that front, but the government would certainly be annihilated immediately if it accepted demands of further outside-imposed austerity. That's not the case for corruption and tax-evasion. The general attitude is that the EZ wanted those to be tackled and the previously governing political personnel chose to overtax the middle class instead, in order to save their friends and themselves. 

They are informing me that after the announcements before the vote of confidence (where he reasserted that they'll create a registry not only for landowners but also a general property registry, that all lists of potential tax-evaders will be investigated, that their new and improved IRS will be ""unleashed"" on tax-evaders, that any property not declared so that it will be taxed will be confiscated and sold etc) the approval rating of the new government's directions is soaring at &gt;70% in recent polls. They expected them to mellow their tone a bit after their election, and they haven't so people are very optimistic that shit is going to get done.

I don't know what's going to happen, but I can attest to the fact that the attitude towards the previous governments was not the same.",null,0,null,1423610342,null,0,false,0,cohjoxu,null,t3_2vbhn1,null,t1_cohjoxu,null,t1_cogw2uk,null,null,null,1424519533,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

What time of the year are you going? If it is warm, ALWAYS pack a swimsuit for your son. There are plenty of great playgrounds with water features. We learned it the hard way. 
Also, if it's warm, spend a day in a public pool (Suedbed, etc in Nuremberg). They have lawns to lay on, and all sorts of snacks, from french fries to cocktails.  Also, if you have a chance, take your kid to the Playmobil land in Stein (close to Nuremberg, but not so easy to get to by public transportation. It's an all-you-can-play place with tons of Playmobil stuff, and lots of great playgrounds. Again, there is water to play in. One of the nice things - after you pay for the ticket (!5 euros or so), all the attractions are free, and even the food is reasonably priced. It's worth the trip. Yes, exit through the gift shop, but otherwise a children's paradise.
For the medieval experience, Bamberg is almost more impressive than Nuremberg (which lost a lot of its old buildings in WW2). Great for exploring the narrow streets on foot, and the dome is rather impressive, too. You can take a cheap train from Nuremberg to Bamberg - maybe a 45 minute trips.
In Nuremberg you might want to check out the train museum, and also the Zoo. Both are easy to get to by public transportation, which is  well developed. I would say that a lot of the younger people that you meet will be able to speak English, and usually they are rather keen on trying it on native speakers, so I wouldn't be too concerned.

The unions have so much power in Illinois that the state is about to go broke paying their pensions. Pennsylvania, California, New York,  states with most of America's population, all have powerful unions.  New Jersey teachers' union is a behemoth. 

Plus America's labor laws are not as ""wild west"" as the media suggests. The reality is complex.    It may be easier to get fired in America, but it is also easier to get hired.

That is a global problem.  Europe has its fair share of dysfunctional markets, too.

null,false,gorat,ANAR,Anarchy,null,"&gt; &gt; Greece politicians are corrupt. The current German government (through mr. Schauble) declared before the May and June 2012 elections that we'd better vote for the same party (New Democracy) and continue the program. They tried the same last month even after 5 years of having them in power. I understand that they are essentially the same party (they are both conservatives) but supporting them in such a way even when they did NOTHING to fight corruption is a problem.

&gt; The question is always what is the alternative and it is not possible to look at the foreseeable future and say that the greece government at the moment will do much better. I very much doubt that they will stay in power long if they continue the way they are going right now.
&gt; There is almost no support from any other state for greeces goals. The picture that syriza painted that the whole south would raise against the north - and especially germany - did not come true (yet). On the other side the UK and Finland will have elections this year and in case of the UK i very much doubt atm, that they will vote left wing.

Why do you believe that the new Greek government will not do anything about corruption? The picture that syriza paints is that the South cannot stand the measures imposed by 'the North' (essentially by the financial sector voiced through the German government). The discussion on the goals and who supports and who doesn't will be discussed in the Eurogroup this week so we will see about this. The UK and Finland will probably go to the right, Spain will go to the left and then we'll see. 

&gt; &gt; Greek industry is very corrupt. So is German industry (and imho all industries).
&gt; According to transparency international Germany is ranked 12th, Greece is ranked 69. That means that between Germany and Greece are 56 countries.
&gt; So yes, while there is still corruption in Germany, i would argue Germany does a better job at fighting it.

I never claimed that Germany is more corrupt than Greece.

&gt; &gt; One of the major bribing scandals in Greece from the time before the crisis was the Siemens scandal. In which the (German) company Siemens bribed the Greek politicians (same party that signed the memorandum 2010) to get big infrastructure contracts. The Siemens employee that knows names etc (a Greek-German called Christoforakos) is currently given asylum in Germany that refuses to extradite him to Greece to stand trial. I am not trying to blame all of our problems to Germany - I'm just saying that corruption runs internationally - it is not just 'Greek' companies or politicians that do it. There are hundreds of corruption scandals involving Greek companies, foreign companies in Greece, the Church, politicians of both the ruling parties (Socialists and Conservatives) etc.

&gt; So what you are telling me is not new. While companies in germany behave the way they should (mostly), Greece is not able to fight it effectively. Is it Germanys business to get Greece to be effective? How many greeks were involved in this scandal? Why does Siemens think they HAVE TO bribe anyone?
&gt; What i see is a company that just knows how to navigate in the markets they are in. This is not germany's fault nor could you make the german people responsible.

German companies are no different than Greek companies. They will be corrupt where the laws and system 'allow' them to be corrupt, and they will pay good money to influence and keep the system corrupt so they can get preferential treatment.

&gt; &gt; The hope that SYRIZA can clean that is only from what they say, and the fact that they never ruled until now (they have no corrupt infrastructure) and they are under much scrutiny by everyone.

&gt; Hope is not the same as trust, which is my point. While i agree that the greek people trust them, the reality is that the markets and the creditors have to trust them as well.

There is nothing that can be done to make the anonymous 'markets' trust a government. The creditors should be willing to listen, but they don't seem to be. It is a sad situation indeed - when the people exercise their democratic right and 'the markets' and 'the creditors' are seen as more important than that.

&gt;&gt; That is a GREAT question! Part of the money went to legitimate infrastructure (such as research, agriculture, tourism infrastructure, roads and railways, bridges, schools, ports, hospitals etc). Part of the money was lost through corruption by the people that 'absorbed' it. What percentage is impossible to estimate - I would say it depends a lot by sector. The 'Great Banquet' of corruption was by far the Olympic Games, for which huge amounts of money were given to 'friends' of the government to build infrastructure that was subsequently left to rot.

&gt; Which is why many people here are .... how should i say it ... sceptical about giving greece more money. People look at it as a waste of money and they need to find some kind of trust to the greece government -&gt; which is why i don't think that antagonizing germany is particularly smart.

I understand that. However, antagonizing THE POLICIES that Germany imposed and that didn't work at all might be the correct solution for the whole of the European people including the German people.

&gt; I can tell you, stupid infrastructure projects for the sake of GDP were done and that made Greeces infrastructure is way too overblown as well.

&gt;&gt;Example?

&gt; Welp how about the thessaloniki metro? Yeah let us make a subway... in a ground so archaeologically rich we will have.to.delay.it.for.years. While also being a freaking nightmare from the cost perspective.

The Athens metro was also built in decades. Greek cities having archaeologically rich soil is a given.

&gt; Also several embankment dam who are working way below a normal effectivity rate and not to forget that there are roads to freaking every ""secret"" and uninhabited beach there is.

true

&gt; Obv. the last paragraph is exaggerated but i hope you understand what i am getting at.
&gt; That is also a great question. Greece's economy runs on 3 main 'axes': commerce (esp. shipping), agriculture and tourism.These industries don't really need a 'cash injection' that much. However, unless we can shift the Greek economy towards a more 'modern' economy the country will not be producing almost anything in the next decades. The 90s-00s idea was to turn Greece into the 'development hub' of the Balkans (and possibly the Turkey area). Meaning banking sector, construction of big projects, building, IT, headquarters of large companies etc. That didn't work out. The 2010s idea (just before crisis) was 'green development' meaning production of energy from solar and wind power, modernizing agriculture and creating alternative tourism destinations to extend tourism to year round. That never had a chance to get off the ground... I have no idea what the new one will be honestly - but IT and research/development sounds good - we have extremely educated personnel often with international work experience. There is also oil that could be another new booming sector that needs to be explored.

&gt; Okay here is why i have a problem with that. Turkey actually became that kind of country. They still have a low wage etc. but they do have a way better growth rate and came better out of the crisis. In Fact, almost everyone there has a way lower average wage, not only Turkey. This leads to them manufacturing the clothes, the food and the machines that once were made in Greece. Greece minimum wage triples their northern neighbors, things can't work out that way.

Turkey DID become this right after Greece collapsed. Turkey is ruled by a half-crazy dictator guy. I'd rather be poor and free than live under Turkish conditions honestly.

&gt; I can tell you what the greeks could do. They could start to produce for their own market and if that is not possible, because it is not worth it, you might see where some of the problems lie.

I agree with that. Especially agriculture should shift from cotton to other things esp. edibles for the local market. EU subsidies for cotton have made the Greek farmers extremely spoiled in the last 30 years (and now really poor too for the most part).

&gt; We both can agree, that there was a huge greek bubble that inflated both average wage and - which is worse - let the cronys profit like hell.

Oh yes for sure we agree on that. The problem is that when the bubble burst, the cronys floated and the average person got destroyed. That was the worst part.

&gt;&gt; And they imported many manual workers from the south of europe (gastarbeiter) as many Greeks, Turks etc moved there during the 50s.

&gt; Germany imported cheap UNSKILLED labor, which isn't to crazy thinking about the losses in terms of the war. I am not sure why you bring them up anyway. The greeks are fairly well integrated into german society, imo even better than the italians that came earlier.

I was just saying that German rebuilding was an effort of people from different backgrounds. Similar to the Greek years of economic growth (many migrant workers etc).

&gt;&gt; More than 200,000 Greeks have left since the crisis began. The Greek brain drain[1] has been widely reported. I am one of them for example, after 10+ years of education and expertise in various EU countries (and Greece), I finally moved to the US to do research 3 years ago because there was no job in Greece. I can only hope for a stimulus to come back to Europe but with deflationary politics that doesn't seem like it's happening any time soon.

&gt; So what you are saying is, we should make a new bubble instead of - you know - solving the structural problems in greece (tax evasion, corruption, crony capitalism) first? Yeah. That will totally happen.

Not instead and not a bubble. Creation of jobs has to be a first priority. 60% unemployment of young people do you understand this???

&gt; Do you see any german criticising the irish? Nope and you know why? They are mostly silent and try to pull their shit together, which is when i ask people if we should support them more they say yes, if they need it no problem. Greece on the other hand is a different matter altogether.

So we have to shut up afraid that we will anger our masters? I think not... The Irish can do whatever they want. 

&gt; Also the EZB already announced the Q.E. program. The problem is greece does not qualify for it.

The ECB decision was at least questionable. As an independent EU institution they should not be affected by 'rumors' and 'discussions'. But well, asking for fairness is overplayed anyway.

&gt;&gt; The only way to have people not go for the far right extremes is to have them believe in 'democracy' again or some form of it at least. The previous government was a far right government (not nazi just far right). They tried to blame immigrants for many of the problems they were creating, they tried to blame left wingers and intellectuals etc etc etc. This thing was (at least)(...)

&gt; I would disagree big time. Germany is not known as a strongly ideological state and Merkel isn't as well. She is actually one of the most centrist right wingers that exist in all of europe both domestically and on international policy level.

That's what your media probably tell you. [Others](http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/fintan-o-toole-in-the-battle-over-greece-s-debt-german-idealism-is-pitted-against-greek-realism-1.2097111) might disagreek.

&gt; Do you know the country Slovakia? They paid for the greek too. They have it way worse both structurally and economically but they paid without problems.
&gt; So why shouldn't they get their Marshall plan? What about Romania? What about Bulgaria? What about Spain? What about Finland?

Obviously any stimulus package should be extended to all EU countries especially of the 'periphery'. It would be great for all these countries to get some more $$$ so they can come to Greece for holidays and we can buy Finnish vodka or whatever they produce in Slovakia.

&gt; Who should pay for all those marshall plans? Why should anyone believe that anyone would pay back their debts - at least in part?

All of the EU according to the profit they make in a similar way that New York or Texas pays a bit for Iowa or Nebraska. We need to recycle profits to keep the economy going.

&gt; The EU is not the USA. No one will ask them when they think they can pay back their stuff and no one will even ask about it. The US NEVER defaulted for a reason.

The US has a crazy amount of debt but so does the Eurozone. If you think that Germany is better off by itself then we should dissolve it. But having a EU and a Eurozone in which so many countries have no say about fiscal rules and when they try to democratically talk they are shunned as thieves, well that is not a way to run a UNITED Europe. If we wanted to be German colonies there were chances earlier in our history multiple times. Sometimes maybe we just need to eat the losses and clean our own house the hard way.

null,false,Toppo,FINL,Finland,null,"They had a reason during WWII. Leningrad/St. Petersburg is a major city, and the entry to it is the Gulf of Finland. Soviet Union wanted to secure St. Petersburg and the Finnish border at that time was [very close to St. Petersburg](http://prokarelia.net/fi/kuvat/finland_i.jpg). The peace treaty with the Soviet Union also included that Finland will lease the [Porkkala peninsula](http://www.weather-forecast.com/place_maps/po/Porkkala-4.8.gif) to the Soviet Union for 50 years (untill 1994). That way the Soviet Union had complete control on the entry to St. Petersburg, as Estonia was occupied and Porkkala was leased, so they could use their artillery and military bases from both sides of the gulf. As missile technology developed, Porkkala became obsolete, as the missiles from Estonia had such a long range that the Gulf of Finland could be controlled from there, so the Soviet Union retreated from Porkkala in 1955 and Finland got it back. So there were strategic reasons for trying to occupy Finland, or parts of it.

Also, Finland had been independent from Russia just 22 years and got the independence during the Russian revolution and civil war. The independence was granted by Lenin on the assumption that Finnish socialist would get in power in Finland and they would join the USSR in the future, but during the Finnish Civil War the reds lost and the German-allied whites won so the expectation of Lenin did not happen. So the attempt in occupation also was the Soviet Reds trying to correct the wrong of Reds losing in Finland. They actually expected the Finnish Reds of the civil war to support the Soviet Union, but Finns stood together and the Reds of the Civil War of Finland largely opposed the Soviet occupation and defended Finland.

What would be comparable to the situation in 1939 is that the contemporary Russian Federation would like to return the relatively recent borders of the USSR, as the dissolution of the Soviet Union happened 24 years ago, as compared to the Russian Revolution which happened 22 years prior to WWII.

Now it's been almost 100 years of Finnish independence, the Russian revolution isn't a recent political turmoil and the Soviet ideology and assumptions behind the recognition of Finnish independence and stance of Finnish Reds don't exist.",null,0,null,1423611286,null,0,false,0,cohk8ep,null,t3_2vfqjn,null,t1_cohk8ep,null,t1_cohj6j1,null,null,null,1424519996,null,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14,null

The truth, however, is that creditors have a moral responsibility to lend wisely. If they fail to do due diligence on their borrowers, they deserve what is going to happen. [...]

The second proposition is that, since the crisis hit, the rest of the eurozone has been extraordinarily generous to Greece. This, too, is false. [...] But this went overwhelmingly **not to benefiting Greeks but to avoiding the writedown of bad loans** to the Greek government and Greek banks. Just 11 per cent of the loans directly financed government activities. Another 16 per cent went on interest payments. The rest went on capital operations of various kinds: the money came in and then flowed out again. A more honest policy would have been to bail lenders out directly. But this would have been too embarrassing. [...]

As the Greeks point out, debt relief is normal. Germany, a serial defaulter on its domestic and external debt in the 20th century, has been a beneficiary. **What cannot be paid will not be paid.** The idea that the Greeks will run large fiscal surpluses for a generation, to pay back money creditor governments used to rescue private lenders from their folly is a delusion.

Here is my reply. 


&gt; Clark is mostly talking about Bush administration.

Are you saying the Obama administration has not pursued the same foreign policy objectives?  I think its clear that they have, and with a great deal of enthusiasm. 

&gt;Russians are losing their buffer countries mostly through their own fault. 

I doubt that's how they see it. In fact I'm not even sure what you mean here.

&gt;Even Yanukovich had made the decision to sign European Association Agreement before caving under Kremlin's pressure. 

True as far as I know..  but really that's not something I know much about. I'm not privy to the full information and I wasnt paying any attention to Ukraine before this. I can only go on what I've been told after the trouble started. 

&gt;And no, there was no covert Western operation in Kiev. If were was one, it went very well because there is not a single piece of evidence.

Because you would know? You really seem to be far too confident about your facts. I doubt you know more than what you've read on here and seen on TV etc. If you had to be honest you would probably admit that almost none of our information sources are really reliable and none are comprehensive. We get tiny fragments of the picture. It often takes decades for the full facts to come out and even then there is often much that we never have clarified. The US has been meddling in foreign politics for a long time before either of us was born.

Yeah, that's called ""risk"". Lenders lose their money if things turn sour. Anyway, there isn't a ""moral responsibility"". That's a political rhetoric to justify the default. Greece is free to claim so, but the risk is then greater for lenders and the rates increase or people simply stop investing.

&gt;What I said, is that I have no respect for mass murderers, no matter their achievements. What I also said, is that we should stop heroizing said mass murderers.

Again you are engaging in sophistries and dont know how to argue.

 Here what I wrote in my FIRST REPLY  to the Urkainian.

*Dolcester: And it is not that I approve Hitler.*

/U/SnobbyEuropean  you remember how this discussion started?

I was calling out this shameless propagandist that screw the data and this is what I wrote. This is how it started.  All the wall text you just wrote, just repeat my original comments and points

Here:http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2v7ld8/poll_52_of_russians_view_stalin_positively/cofdrml?context=3

You came to call me out and I argue you down simply, I even wrote

*You must be young? Who care of your opinion. If you wish to value non tangible methaphisical nonsense values well that is your problem Stalin did deliver if he didnt didnt do his reforms USSR would have been defeat . I value results over processus.*

So after this comment it was pretty clear I was pretty over with the  discussion and I did understand that you believe in fairytales and I did stick with my point. but a last you came back and start all this nonsense debate.

Now you are telling me that it is me that is not understanding your point and that I was out of context.



And Here what you wrote

*In that case, fuck Russians along with Stalin. Heroizing and romanticizing a cruel dictator and a mass murderer is never right, no matter what ""good"" he did.*

So
1) Nobody in this poll or me did heroize or romanticize anyone.

2)That show to me that you didnt even bother to read   the poll

Again the question of the poll was 

 **What role do you believe that Stalin played in everyday life in our country?**

What is the link with Katyn massacre??? **Everyday life **Can you read English? Well in their evreyday life he managed to raise literacy and improve their quality of life. WICH MEAN HE HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT in their everyday life.

And you came with this complete out of context reply about Katyn or whatever crap about hero.

*Dolcester: Stalin did deliver if he didnt didnt do his reforms USSR would have been defeat*(wich mean he had a positive impact on evevery day life)

*SnobbyEuropean: Committing war crimes such as the Katyn massacre, cruel oppression of captured territories, ""disappearences"", executions, rape, torture, and every other cruel shit Stalin is responsible for must have helped the war effort, right?*

What is the link with the question of the  poll or everything I wrote earlier to the Ukrainian and in my first reply to you? Did he have a positive impact on everyday life of Russian?? Well, then yes! 

So yes you are an idiot

Again you are engaging in sophistries.

&gt;What I did say, is that Ukraine will eventually fall, but it won't affect Europe, and as long as we defend our borders, Russia can be repelled if they don't use nukes.

Russia has no intention to push beyond her own borders or  nobody will try to cut links with her as I already said Merkel is smart way more smarter than the other european leaders she sent her economic cooperation minister to Moscow last week wich  mean   she has a plan. I will be in Germany in two weeks and I will try to talk to the minister to get some infos.  Again you believe in  dumb things , fairytales with no understanding on international matters.  Again you are as many people from the masses disconnect from real matters.

Hey, maybe next time you think before you post? People don't sign up into the military to become mindless drones. They have their own personal politics too. They sign up to serve their country, not to meddle in international conflicts of low priority (we're not talking about genocide in Yugoslavia or a peacekeeping mission elsewhere). We're not talking about a war that is already on our hands. NATO has not entered the Ukrainian war. So you can't say that they have to follow orders because there is no such order yet, right now it's up for discussion. 

We're talking about entering or not entering an ongoing conflict. I'm saying that if you're for entering the war, go there and grab a rifle, Ukrainian Army could use men to help stave off Russian aggression. NATO is not going into this conflict unless something very drastic happens. It bothers me a lot when I see keyboard warriors eager to get into a war that they won't fight, because their CoD and Arma isn't giving enough 'muh immersionz' to them.

&gt;And now, for the Xth time, I repeat, I'm not a ""legalist"", and I despise those who are legalists in radical situations, effectively siding with mass murderers. 

Yes I did understand read my previous comment again, I said that you were Manichean(So yes I did understand that you hold dumb values in high esteem and that you think life is pink or black). As I already said; Outside Europe people have a legalism point of view, they do not believe in absolute evil or in absolute good wich is quite rational and direclty in line with philosopher like Burke and Locke. By the way there cant be such things such as ""Radical legalism""(That doesnt exist)

&gt;This is a question of belief and morals

Read my first comment before this debate start and read what I wrote in this reply(Part 1) carefully.

&gt;About literacy... Again, you managed to completely misunderstand my point. I didn't say that there weren't any intellectuals in the Soviet Union, or that they couldn't keep up with the west in technology. Nothing like that. I meant that someone that heroizes a cruel dictator is still a barbarian to me, no matter his or her education.

Read the questions of the poll , read my comment(Part 1/2) again we are turning in circle. Nobody did heroize anyone.

Here actually what you wrote

*Other, actually civilized countries managed to rise the literacy rate while not fucking killing and torturing millions. A barbarian who knows how to read and write is still a barbarian.*

And I bring literacy rate in the context.

and here my reply 

*No other democracy manage to did that(**In less than 9 years in a world plague by protectionism where your neighbourghs are on the verge of invading you**)*

I was nerver out of context in in this discussion in a single time. I even provide the historical explanation that many popular scholars and expert on Stalinism such as Robert C. Tucker did agree. 

&gt;given that the conversational partner doesn't act like a condescending dick

You did came thinking you knew me , thinking that I was one of those dumb leftist nationalists. But surprise given my wealth and my experience, I'm not shy to act condescending especially in front of delusional young men.  I'm quite rational given my job and I understand many things.


&gt;In the end, we are arguing about completely different things. I'm arguing against legalism and the heroization of dictators, while you keep coming up with new subjects 

Because you are an idiot that didnt read the poll dont try to blame me.

&gt;This is like arguing with a 10 year old who refuses to pack up the match with a tie in a conversation about something entirely subjective:

Well that is quite ironic, read my first comment(part 1/2). The 10 years old was you.

&gt;About Russian economics, which again, you brought up as a response to my ""Russia is not in a better position than Europe"" comment: I still hold my opinion.

I never brought up Russian economics, I basically said that Ger Muller did travel in Russia last week , I will probably see him in two weeks and ask him some questions. As I already said Russia will be ready for the FIFA 2018 worldcup. Because  it will be in that year that her major shift of trade will be towards Asia. That is why many people in the sector were quite happy. No she is not expansionist again you believe in fluff.

Part of the article

&gt;[...] When asked why she had not used her pass key to go into another room, she said they all had “Do Not Disturb” signs on the door. After her grand jury testimony, prosecutors discovered that this was false when the hotel belatedly provided them with the electronic key records showing that Diallo had entered room 2820 at 12:26 PM, after her encounter with DSK. 

&gt;The same record showed that she had also entered room 2820 prior to her encounter with DSK at a time when the occupant had not checked out and may have been in the room. Why she concealed visiting 2820 was “inexplicable” to the prosecutors, who noted in their motion for dismissal that if she had mentioned her visits to 2820, it would have been declared part of the crime scene and searched by the police. But she did not do so.

&gt;Nor were DSK’s lawyers able to find an explanation. When they attempted to learn the identity of the occupant of 2820, Sofitel refused to release it on grounds of privacy. Given Diallo’s conflicting accounts, all that we really know about what happened in the nearby room 2820 is that Diallo went there both before and after her encounter with DSK and then omitted the latter visit from her sworn testimony to the grand jury. We still do not know if there was anyone in 2820 when she entered it again following the encounter with DSK or if, prior to the police arriving, anyone influenced her to omit mention of room 2820.

&gt;The Sofitel electronic key record, which the hotel did not turn over to the prosecutors until the next week, contained another unexplained anomaly. Two individuals, not one, entered DSK’s suite between 12:05 and 12:06 PM while he was showering. Each used a different key card entry. The key card used at 12:06 belonged to Diallo; the key card used at 12:05 belonged to Syed Haque, a room service employee who, according to his account, came to pick up the breakfast dishes. If he did so, he would have turned left and gone to the dining room. But Haque has refused to be interviewed by DSK’s lawyers, so his precise movements have not been made public. Since the key cards do not register the time of exit, it cannot be determined from them if both parties were in the room at the same time or, for that matter, at the time of Diallo’s encounter with DSK.

&gt;DSK’s BlackBerry, with its messages, is still missing. Investigations by both the police and private investigators retained by DSK’s lawyers failed to find it. While DSK believed he had left it in the Sofitel, the records obtained from BlackBerry show that the missing phone’s GPS circuitry was disabled at 12:51. This stopped the phone from sending out signals identifying its location. Apart from the possibility of an accident, for a phone to be disabled in this way, according to a forensic expert, required technical knowledge about how the BlackBerry worked.

&gt;From electronic information that became available to investigators in November 2011, it appears the phone never left the Sofitel. If it was innocently lost, whoever found it never used it, raising the question of by whom and why it was disabled at 12:51. In any case, its absence made it impossible for DSK to check—as he had planned to do—to see if it had been compromised. Nor was it possible to verify from the phone itself the report he received on May 14 that his messages were being intercepted. So we cannot confirm the warning to DSK that he was under surveillance on that disastrous day.

&gt;One vexing mystery concerns the one-hour time gap in reporting the alleged attack on Diallo. After she said that she had been the victim of a brutal and sustained sexual assault, it is hard to understand how the security staff would have ruled out that she might require immediate medical attention. But as has been seen, until 1:31, several minutes after receiving a message from Sheehan, the security staff did not make the 911 call. She did not arrive at St. Luke’s Hospital until 3:57 PM, nearly four hours after the alleged attack. We do not know what decisions were made during that one-hour interval or how they influenced what was to later unfold with such dramatic impact. [...]

null,false,ohthehorrors,ASTR,Austria,null,"*Der Standard has published an interview with Jörg Leichtfried, a social democratic MEP about the TTIP-negotiations. As it is only available in German, i have translated it*  

Jörg Leichtfried, head of the delegation of the SPÖ in the European Parliament and vice president of the Socialists &amp; Democrats has recently read „secret“ documents about the free trade agreement TTIP. He is still not allowed to talk about the conclusions he draws from this lecture. And: „The really important things that one would need for decission making are still not acessible“, criticizes Leichtfried. 

**derStandard.at**:  You have recently had acess to the well-know reading reading room where the documents about the TTIP-negotiations are stored for the first time. A revelation?  
**Leichtfried**: This is a room with a room number, that is not planned in the building plan of the EU-Parlaiment. It has the end number 18 and wenn one enters this part of the building, one finds the doors 17 and 19. There is nothing inbetween. I asked at 17 and there i was advised that 18 was no office and that everything is very secret. Eventually, i was brought to the famous room 18, where the TTIP-Documents are stored.

**derStandard.at**:  Were you allowed to read the TTIP-documents according to your preferences?  
**Leichtfried**:  No, everything was very difficult. One has to hand in the mobile phone and everything that would allow recordings and is only allowed to enter the room with a pen. The room is strongly secured with an electrical combination lock. A paper with ones own name is supplied, that seems to be useable for secret notices.I was only given the binders i had ordered.

**derStandard.at**: Which documents have you ordered?  
**Leichtfried**: I was interested in questions of food safety and transport policies. An employee was in the room for the whole time i studied those documents. 

**derStandard.at**: Was your lecture insightful?  
**Leichtfried**:  It is an improvement, that one is able to see those binders. Previously, this was only possible for a small group of persons. But: The really important things, that one would need for making a decission are still not acessible: the concrete results of the negotiations and the drafts of the Americans are also not acessible. It would be necessary to have these informations to come to make a decission.

**derStandard.at**:  What could you see?  
**Leichtfried**:  Acessible are the positions of the comission for the negotiations. One can see how those positions have changed. But this is it.

**derStandard.at**: Does the position of the comission represent the position of the parliament from your perspective?  
**Leichtfried**: The European Parliament will reseolve a resolution regarding TTIP in May, from my perspective, this will strongly reglement the position of the comission in the negotiations, especially in the critical areas investor protection and transatlantic legislative cooperation. It will be a challenge for the comission to turn its position around if it wants the confirmation of the EU-Parliament. But without this, there is no proceeding.

**derStandard.at**: You are not allowed to talk about the content of your reading?  
**Leichtfried**: No, i am not allowed to say what is in there. This would be irresponsible in a stage like this, where we still have to read the files in detail, a carefull conduct is necessary. 

**derStandard.at**: Isn't it problematic, that not even you as a MEP are not allowed to see the american position?
**Leichtfried**:  As far as i know, this is a guideline of the americans to even enter negotiations with the EU. They also demand a carefull controll of this secrecy, that they could also enforce themselfes. Of course, this is a bit strange. 

**derStandard.at**: Who in Austria knows the position of the americans. Pime Minister Werner Faymann as a member of the European Council maybe?  
**Leichtfried**: The council is also sparsely informed. When it comes to the TTIP-negotiations, I may be one of the best informed Austrians. I am also active in informal contacts.

**derStandard.at**: Which critical points do you see regarding food?  
**Leichtfried**: We don't want chlorinated chicken. But the Americans also don't want our non-chlorinated chicken. This can be easily solved politically. The chicken stay at home. One of the critical points are geographic denominations. Styrian horseradish can only come from Styria. 

**derStandard.at**: What are the critical points regarding traffic?  
**Leichtfried**: I am very critical about the discussions about puglic services, there is the attempt from both the USA and the EU to liberalise to non-liberalised markets. One has to be very carefull that this does not happen. 

**derStandard.at**: The social democratic faction in the EU parliaments does not seem to agree with itself about TTIP.  
**Leichtfried**: I want, that we, the Social Democratic faction in the EU parliament agree, that we will vote against TTIP, if investment protection is a part of this agreement.  By no later than March, we will discuss and resolve this in our faction. I don't see large fronts but rather singular actors who are very free-trade oriented.

**derStandard.at**: When could you see the  TTIP-agreement beeing ratified by the EU-parliament.  
**Leichtfried**: This mostly depends on the Americans. The question is, weather the Republicans, that now have a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate will continue their senseless blockade policy in order to not give the president a sucess before the elections. Or if the prefer to act as a serious partner and ratify TTIP until the End of 2015. If the ratification should be delayed until after the elections in the USA, things may extend over a long time. 

**derStandard.at**: In Brussels, one says that Austria was the country that opposes TTIP the most. Do you experience similar tendencies among the MEPs?  
**Leichtfried**: TTIP is a big issue not only in Austria, but also in Germany, the United Kingodm, France and Belgium. These are not unimportant contries. Over here, the discussion has a greater publicity than in other countries, but it is just a question of time until this leaps over to other countries. 

**derStandard.at**: Is the secrecy about a free trade agreement a strong factor for the resistence against it?   
**Leichtfried**: The comission could have prevented a lot of resistence if it had not acted in such narrow-minded and arrogant way. Some details of the negotiations don't need to be made public, but the basic positions of the councils should have been explained from the beginning. I, for myself follow the directives and laws regarding secrecy. But i will work to change these laws so that i can provide informations in interviews like this one.

So you're asking the Baltics and Poland to not only put their faith in a completely unproven alliance, but one which is objectively inferior to the one they already have. 

Of course, the other big problem is that an integrated EU military is a pipe dream. The EU doesn't even have a united monitary policy; a united foreign policy is compeltely off the table. Making matters worse, the UK, one of the few European countries with any real power to speak of, is constantly threatening to leave altogether. It's a bit of a problem when the backbone of your military might just up and leave at any given time. 

And that's before we get into the fact that no one wants to pay for it. As much as people bitch about Americans dominating European policy, you know what they'd bitch about a lot more? Having to pay for their own defense. Just about everyone is slashing their military budgets as it is, and no one's going to want to pick up the slack to cover the entire continent, *especially* with how lax the overwhelming majority of countries are. 

Basically, it's not gonna happen. Anyone pushing for a true EU military is bound to be disappointed, and Poland and the Baltics are right to look elsewhere.

If you asked the average American about people going bankrupt from medical bills, they'd probably acknowledge the fact, because it's been reported in the news in recent years enough... however, they'd counter with the idea that, ""it doesn't affect my life and it doesn't affect anyone I know, and my life is pretty good."" Therefore, they wouldn't see it as being a thing which degrades their quality of life as compared to how they might live elsewhere in the world - such as in Austria. 

In fact, I'll tell you as an American, that I simply haven't been to see a doctor at all for the past fifteen years, except a couple times last year in order to get a health clearance for the visa to live in the country where I now am. Perhaps my situation is a little bit unusual in the rarity with which I visit medical professionals, however maybe it can illustrate how people get accustomed to the environment they live in and they don't think of it as being abnormal or bad in any way.

Of course, because this is the /r/europe subreddit.. the more important social effect we're seeing here is likely that it's always more appropriate to be critical of one's own country and appreciative of other countries.

I will start with China because many assume it must be in good shape due to its reserves. China's growth while other economies have stagnated is not some magic formula they have discovered. It has been financed with debt. Most of this debt does not show up in their official sovereign ratings due to the unique way the financial industry and economy are structured there. 

China's economy is centrally directed not centrally controlled. The national government tells the regions their target growth, and they break it down to municipalities. Municipalities often meet this target by building real estate. This overbuilding has far outstripped demand and has caused the emergence of [ghost cities](http://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-ghost-cities-in-2014-2014-6). China's public debt has reached [250%](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21625785-its-debt-will-not-drag-down-world-economy-it-risks-zombifying-countrys-financial). This is slightly less than developed economies but the issue is the debt's rate of growth. It has risen 100% in GDP terms since 2008. And keep in mind, much of that GDP growth has been directed into what could potentially be another very serious bubble. That ignores the off balance sheet lending that is rampant in China, and debt owned by its state banks and corporations. 

Sorry for the rambling, but tried to explain China's situation as condensed as I could. Long story short, if China is going to lend, it will likely be internally. I would not count on them being a source of capital. Their national debt does not cause any alarms to go off, which is what most people look at. But the aggregate situation paints a much different picture. 

Russia, obvious. 

The US is in a better situation than Russia and I would argue China due to its ability to borrow for such low rates. But I would not be surprised if more restructuring of the US financial markets took place in the near future. Not to mention, I am not sure if the US would be willing to shove the Eurozone big boys/girls to the side to restructure Greece on its own. It typically cooperates on issues of international importance with EU partners. I dont think it would be cavalier enough to shove everyone aside and try to bilaterally solve Greece's debt issues without any input from European leaders. 

**EDIT:** Correction, China's public debt is now [""far higher""](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-02-09/weak-china-import-figures-shouldn-t-spur-stimulus) than that of advanced economies like the US, Germany, or Australia. This article is a really good read that I found after the fact. It touches on several of the things I was talking about slightly more in depth than I went in. 

Lastly, China has one of the worst demographic outlooks out of any country. Its [own study](http://english.caixin.com/2011-12-23/100342018.html) stated in 2010 China's worker to pensioner ratio was 3:1, by 2015 it estimated that ratio would be 2:1, and by 2040 1:2. I am not sure it is in the market for low return restructuring obligations. Sorry for the long winded reply. China is complex enough to write a book on, and it looks like I wrote half of one.

null,false,Wandsethal,null,null,null,"- **friendships**: Germans are always game to casually drink a beer or two with, but take comparatively long before they form friendships (usually longer than half a year). When you DO make a German friend though, you'll have a loyal, honest friend for life. Germans tend to have a very fixed circle of friends who they spend time with, usually distinctly seperate from their work colleagues. Hanging out with your work colleagues/fellow interns etc. is not done on a regular basis. Sports tend to be pursued in specific clubs that require membership. most people who go to gyms tend to get their workout in and leave. When a German offers to take you along to some outing definitely take them up on it, but don't expect the group you meet there to automatically become your new circle of friends (might happen, of course, but is pretty rare) for the duration of your stay. Try, if you can, to find out if you can pursue any of your hobbies in the area where you are going to stay and seek contact with the corresponding club/organisation in advance. Maybe hit up the subreddit for your area and ask there. Getting a foot in the door this way will help you tremendously to get started in terms of hanging out with the natives for the relatively short amount of time you are in-country.
On the same note and as stated before, Germans are a very direct people - we tend not to flatter people just for the heck of it. When a German invites you to visit them or do something with them, they really intend for you to show up. Nobody will force you to do anything against your will of course, but instead of answering ""yeah, I'd love to, I'll give you a call/maybe next weekend etc."", reply with something a lot more noncommital like ""thank you so much for the lovely offer, I'll try to make time but I'm fully booked for the forseeable future."" 

At long last, this is all I can think of that you'd need to know for half a year in Germany.

Greece rigged all the data.

If friend A believed what friend B was saying is true, and did lend him money on B's promise to return in no time, is A to held accountable too? Well, in the hindsight, maybe, cause he didn't question what B was saying well enough.

&gt;As the Greeks point out, debt relief is normal. Germany, a serial defaulter on its domestic and external debt in the 20th century, has been a beneficiary. 

Even if Germany forgive the debt that greece owes them they still owe close to 270 bn euros.

null,false,totitiganiisuntgunoi,ROMA,Romania,null,"Ultimately the crisis Greece is currently facing is of its own making. The list of what you call stereotypes is a fairly accurate if colorful description of the causes of the current mess. A series of corrupt and inept Greek governments created a series of structural weaknesses that rotted the foundations of Greek finances, starting from endemic deficits and a misrepresentation of its true financial situation that lead to its sovereign debt spinning out of control and its credibility on the international financial markets being shattered. Faced with the prospect of insolvency it was forced to ask external financial institutions for aid, and this is what the troika provided. Even if the conditions that the troika required from the Greek government and people may have seemed harsh, this was still better than any deal Greece might have been able to obtain by itself on the world's financial markets once its debt had beed downgraded to junk status.

So when it comes to the moral aspect of the situation, it's hard to pin the blame anywhere else but squarely on the shoulders of Greece, including its government, the people who voted for them, and the civil society that failed to stymie  this slowly evolving disaster. However, and here I agree with [Paul Krugman](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/opinion/paul-krugman-europes-greek-test.html), moralizing on the issue is hardly the best path forward to resolving the crisis in a way that is optimal for Greece, other at-risk Euro member states, and ultimately the entire continent. Austerity has produced results that are mixed at best and at worst have risked to extend Europe's economic future into a prolonged period of stagnation. Moreover for some of the states most severely affected by the crisis, Greece being the obvious example, following the harsh recipe proposed by the most hardline advocates of austerity, Germany being foremost against them, would basically guarantee extreme economic gloom for multiple years, creating a virtually apocalyptic outlook for young people who already now are trying to enter the job market only to be faced with absurdly high levels of unemployment. 

Wit all this in mind, a more pragmatic approach combining an enforcement of Greece's obligations with policies more friendly for short-term growth both in Greece and elsewhere in Europe may be the best solution. However, while there is an increasingly growing chorus of economists and policymakers who advocate such a course of actions, the biggest problem is how to make such a compromise palatable to both the more conservative nordic countries, the hardest hit at-risk economies, and everyone in between. For the sake of Europe, I hope that such a compromise can be found and agreed upon by all parties.",null,0,null,1423623575,null,0,1423628901,0,cohr6cv,null,t3_2vhmh0,null,t1_cohr6cv,null,t3_2vhmh0,null,null,null,1424523234,null,40,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,40,null

I'm sure all the Germans and Finnish and Dutch people will come here in a minute and explain how it's ridiculous and of course all the blame always lies with the debtor. 

But enough joking, on a serious note: There was a concious decision by the political class of the rich countries to use the poor countries, Greece especially, as scapegoats. In reality, the overindebtedness and the lack of competitiveness of the poor countries were greatly amplified by the design of the monetary union. 

But if the rich countries admitted that, that would mean they would admit that the euro had worked in their favour all these years and that the implication would be that it's only fair for them to pay up to prop up the currency. So, instead, they presented the crisis as wholly the fault of individual countries being irresponsible. And as a result, the narrative of the debtor who is fully to blame and the creditor who is fully innocent was born. 

It is that context that allows uttering phrases like ""How many protests against the public debt did Greeks do all these years"" with a straight face while no one has bothered to ask ""How many protests against the precarious investments of banks holding their savings did Germans do all these years""?

Quoting from page 6 of the fact sheet:

&gt; The public debate on the TTIP agreement in many EU countries is a positive step for European democracy. The more opinions expressed, the better informed the outcome will be.

&gt; However, many concerns have been expressed. It is important to set the facts straight and dispel possible misunderstandings.

&gt; To be clear:

&gt; **TTIP will not lower regulatory protection for people or the environment.**

&gt; The examples listed throughout this note show that there are many areas where the EU and US regulations provide for a similarly high level of protection. In these cases we will be able to make our systems more compatible, without lowering protection.

&gt; In other areas the EU and the US have different approaches to regulation, implying different levels of protection.
For instance, the EU has very detailed legislation that lays out when and how **genetically modified products** can be grown or sold in the EU. Our rules do allow some products to be imported and grown but they are much stricter than comparable US rules.

&gt; In a case like this, it is not possible to make the systems compatible, because we have taken different democratic decisions through our legislative processes about what rules are right for our societies. TTIP will do nothing to change those laws.

&gt; The same goes for **hormone-treated meat**. EU legislation lays down requirements on this, and that will not change because of TTIP.

&gt; **A similar but distinct example is the chemicals sector.**

&gt; The EU and US regulate chemicals in different ways. The main European legislation – known as REACH – requires that chemicals sold in Europe be registered with the European Chemicals Agency. The registration must be accompanied by a comprehensive set of data. US law – contained principally in the Toxic Substances Control Act – does not require such registration or submission of data.

&gt; Here again, TTIP is not going to change the underlying legislation. There is no question of any substances being sold in the EU without complying with the REACH requirements, regardless of whether they can be marketed or used in the US.

&gt; **TTIP will not affect the right of either side to make new regulations.**

&gt; Nothing in the TTIP will undermine the EU treaties or Member State Constitutions which lay down the right of governments to make laws and regulations in the public interest.

&gt; The TTIP text will explicitly reaffirm the sovereign right to adopt new regulatory initiatives, to regulate in pursuit of legitimate public policy objectives and to ensure that our laws and policies provide for and encourage high levels of environmental, health, safety, consumer and worker protection and financial stability, as provided for in the EU Treaties.

&gt; The EU's goal for forward looking cooperation on future regulation is to encourage authorities to cooperate as early as possible in their regulatory activity.

&gt; The aim will be to avoid, whenever possible, technical differences that are unnecessary and which only increase compliance costs without providing any benefit in terms of protection.

&gt; If they are not able to find solutions like these, however, regulators will be free to go their own way, as is already the case today. TTIP would in no way force them to put trade or economic considerations above the protection of public policy interests in their future decision-making. TTIP will also not introduce requirements in our decision- making process that could delay regulatory action.

&gt; **TTIP will not circumvent parliaments, governments or stakeholders' roles in the regulatory process.**

&gt; The agreement will not change the principles and the procedures set out in the EU treaties defining how our regulations should be made.

&gt; That means that the European Commission will continue to make proposals and the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union will continue to be co- legislators. More detailed rules will continue to be adopted through delegated and implementing acts, in accordance with the EU's Treaty. TTIP itself will need to be fully, democratically and transparently approved by both the European Parliament and EU Member States.

&gt; Once TTIP is adopted, regulatory cooperation will not change the way each side makes regulation. Both sides are expected to exercise transparency towards each other and to the public in making known their regulatory intentions. This will support more informative interaction among regulators and promote better regulatory outcomes.

&gt; **Both sides have very high levels of regulatory protection.**

&gt; EU regulations are of very high quality but it is a myth that they always offer a higher
level of protection than those of the US. In a number of areas the US has some of the most developed and effective regulations and enforcement mechanisms in the world.

&gt; For instance, in America many cosmetic products such as sunscreens are considered to be over-the-counter medicines, meaning they must be scientifically assessed and approved by the authorities before they can be sold to consumers.

&gt; In Europe cosmetic companies must demonstrate their products are safe and use safe ingredients. Then they can register their products before putting them on the market.

&gt; This does not mean that the EU needs to copy the US regulations, or vice versa, or that the EU offers a lower level of protection. It is simply a difference of approach.",null,0,null,1423626494,null,0,1423627188,0,cohst2q,null,t3_2vhygp,null,t1_cohst2q,null,t3_2vhygp,null,null,null,1424524066,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

Pourtant votre raisonnement sur l'Islam permet d'effectuer un parallèle très évident sur son mauvais usage et ses dérives.

Je vous cite : 

&gt; * If you accept to restrict freedom of expression to confirm to some Islamic interpretation, why stop there? Why not ban or restrict  alcohol and nudity?

&gt; *  it's a slippery slope.  You start accepting some of their behavior (e.g. by restricting freedom of expression), they slowly infiltrate society and next thing you know your head is on a chopping block

Il suffit de remplacer *Islam* par ***invasion de la vie privée*** ou ***NSA***

Ce qui nous donne : 

 * *If you accept to restrict freedom of expression to confirm to some NSA interpretation, why stop there? Why not ban or restrict curtain on window and allowing private discussion?*

etc.. etc... 

Accepter l'un et pas l'autre n'est pas juste et c'est une fallacy (je suis content que vous évoquiez celle du straw man dans un de vos post. C'est assez rare dans le coin)

Je n'accepte pas que la NSA représente les valeurs de la société

Military security is a [non-excludable good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability) -- if you make an area secure, you can't prevent anyone from enjoying the benefit, which means that absent some other mechanism of enforcing payment, normally those people will stop paying (even to the extent of military security in their interest going away):

&gt; Public goods will generally be under produced and under supplied in absence of government subsidies, relative to a socially optimal level. This is due to the fact that potential producers will not be able to realize a profit (since the good can be obtained for free) sufficient enough to justify the costs of production. In this way the provision of non-excludable goods is a classic example of a positive externality which leads to inefficiency.

Maybe someone from the Baltics is more suitable to answer your question, but the point of NATO is to act as collective defence and as a deterrent. When an aggressor attacks any one member, it is considered an attack on all and thus invokes Article 5. All NATO members will pool in troops, aid, etc, however many it is needed to beat back the aggressor. 

I'm pretty sure NATO has some forward deployment plan available for each adversary whether it's ISIS near Turkey's border or Russia on the eastern front. I mean, so far NATO has created a European spearhead force of 5,000 that will react to any threat to NATO Europe, with an additional 30,000 backup troops.

Indeed, it is bizarre to have everyone agree on how Greece can just fuck of and die.

I really always thought Europe had been created as a way to successfully bridge the cultures of our countries and prevent wars. In that regard, the EU is far from the failure so many are so keen to paint it as. I mean let's just look at how Erasmus has created a generation of European students, how the language barrier between countries had never been so tenuous, or how easy it is to decide to go visit a neighboring country. 

Right now everyone is hung up on the economy factor. I even see ppl defend the austerity measures as if they were popular, or made economical sense. But the USA have not implemented such mesures. And they are doing better than we are.

What i am getting at is that one central thinking when it comes to matter of economy is dangerous and that the EU is in danger of imploding if that is the only thing we obsess about when taking about Europe.

Plus, from a history perspective, what image does that give of our generation that we would manage to live 70 years in peace abs then drop an entire country, one with some of the most significant historical importance even, because of a matter of money. Regardless of political opinion, shouldn't the consensus be ""we cannot let Greece go belly up, it is our responsibility as Europeans, as humans, to prevent this from happening?

I've noticed this as well and have two theories:

1. I find that a lot of americans (especially the ones who go to such lengths as to be active on European forums/subs) admire and sometimes even envy Europe. Therefore their demand for European products is high, but European products are extremely overpriced in North America. Something like TTIP would - at least in theory - make the price of those products go down. They don't seem to understand (or simply don't care) that the admiration isn't mutual, and a vast majority of people in Europe really really really don't care for american products (especially food and cars).

2. Other americans (though possibly not a lot of subscribers here) are extremely patriotic. I mean batshit crazy russian-style propaganda eating patriots. They simply cannot understand why someone wouldn't love american products since in their mind those products are the best by far, being made or developed in the USA. They brush it off as ignorance on our part and they want to try to make us to see things their way, therefore pushing stuff like this.

Whichever category they fall in,  I see them like a desperate stalking ex-girlfriend and their society as a whole as a crazy ex-girlfriend that is armed and knows kung-fu.

Also, Finland already employs NATO procedures and participates in NATO exercises and missions so joining NATO is just a formality. The Russians know this, btw. And know that if there ever was a NATO-ex-Warsaw Pact countries war, that both you and Sweden will side with NATO.

Your status as nonmember also forces your country to spend more on defense than NATO members. You also increased your defense spending after Russia's annexation of Crimea, which you shouldn't had to do if you were a part of NATO. 

Also, it can be said that one of the reasons Putin annexed part of the Ukraine was because the Ukraine was leaning to NATO but wasn't protected under Article 5 of NATO, which meant that he didn't risk an immediate war with NATO by annexing part of Crimea. So there's some *de facto* truth to what a Treaty can militarily do all by itself.

null,false,Crytash,GERM,Germany,null,"&gt; Why do you believe that the new Greek government will not do anything about corruption? The picture that syriza paints is that the South cannot stand the measures imposed by 'the North' (essentially by the financial sector voiced through the German government). The discussion on the goals and who supports and who doesn't will be discussed in the Eurogroup this week so we will see about this. The UK and Finland will probably go to the right, Spain will go to the left and then we'll see.

Why i don't believe in them? Maybe because they are promise things they most likely won't get? Syrizas efforts to somehow get more money from Germany are way bigger than trying to actually change they system as well. All indicators that i see point more in the direction to shift the blame away from greece and onto every one else.

You can not earn germanys trust by antagonizing it and without trust there is no reason to work together.

No indicator showed that the spanish government will vote in support for greece on this issue. Not even France seemed to ally itself with greece (and france is fairly left wing from a pol. pov).

&gt; I never claimed that Germany is more corrupt than Greece.

So why even bring it up? Not only it is not more corrupt it *less* corrupt and that is the success of its citizens and laws. Obv. that can change but i hope i won't see that in my lifetime. 

&gt; German companies are no different than Greek companies. They will be corrupt where the laws and system 'allow' them to be corrupt, and they will pay good money to influence and keep the system corrupt so they can get preferential treatment.

Which is not my point, is it. My point is that greece society/culture is different and to change that you need more than just words.

&gt; There is nothing that can be done to make the anonymous 'markets' trust a government. The creditors should be willing to listen, but they don't seem to be. It is a sad situation indeed - when the people exercise their democratic right and 'the markets' and 'the creditors' are seen as more important than that.

You don't really believe that, do you? Nothing is easier to earn as the trust of the market. Do what you said you would do in the long run, which means that you honor the contracts your previous government did. 

""Exercise your democratic right"" is an obv. one. Like free speech greeks can do what every they want. They can vote for a party to leave the Eurozone or to drain their parts of the mediterranean sea, but they have to bear the consequences of their actions as well. If you don't pay your debt you can not expect your creditors to give you more and more money. Greece can not make Germany, Finland or Slovakia pay if they don't want to.

&gt; I understand that. However, antagonizing THE POLICIES that Germany imposed and that didn't work at all might be the correct solution for the whole of the European people including the German people.

Yeah, that is why we see Merkel in a Hitler costume and the talk about German hegemonism, because people are mad at the policies. Don't kid yourself, this is not seen as a policy fight and is not that way portrayed.

Firstly, it doesn't air at the same time. We show it the evening of the same day, and we try and avoid the internet all day so there are no spoilers. There's no voting so other than the spoiler factor, the time delay doesn't matter.

Secondly, we have our own hosts who hosts the show, over the top of your hosts. They're comedians who are really intune with why australia loves eurovision. We actually rarely rarely see or hear from the hosts of the actual show during the broadcast. Honestly, our hosts are a huge part of why australian's love it - I watched Eurovision live from holland in 2011, and it was no where near as funny or enjoyable without our aussie witty banter. 

Basically, Australian's get together for Eurovision parties, where we play drinking games and gamble on who will win. If you're not invited to a eurovision party, you might even go to the local pub to watch it. We take these parties seriously - make european snacks, and dress up in the costumes of our favourite contestants from the semi finals for the finals night (the actual party night).  

I get that its a weird phenomenon to comprehend - it might help to  explain that it's aired on a government owned network that also airs all the languages other than english news (greek news, italian, french news etc) so euro vision is a good natural fit for their base demographic. Then it got popular with people under 30, and we just kind of went with it.

It is not, I agree. (Though people like to make the comparison to the other direction: We should join because Ukraine and Georgia.)

&gt;Also, Finland already employs NATO procedures and participates in NATO exercises and missions

Yes, which a large part of people actually oppose. I and a lot of people feel that it's just a way to take us into NATO without having to have a referendum about it.

&gt;so joining NATO is just a formality

Which is exactly the fear. Certain parties push us towards participating with NATO in everything they have political capital to push us into and then they can just say ""hey, we're basically in, might as well join"". And That's a load of bullshit. That's actually why the pro-NATO parties don't dare to try their chances at a referendum: If it fails, they have to scale back this. If they don't take the referendum, they can keep going on.

Also ""just a formality"". Hardly. It would be a huge thing to us and to Russia.

&gt;The Russians know this, btw.

They do. And they have repeatedly said ""if you do this, we'll consider you a part of NATO"". We have repeatedly done it (again, against the will of the people), and still the threat is in the air. And it probably will be, until we actually join.

&gt;And know that if there ever was a NATO-ex-Warsaw Pact countries war, that both you and Sweden will side with NATO.

That really depends on the situation, don't you think? I think there's a real possibility that Finland and Sweden could remain neutral in the conflict, especially if it's an attack against Russia. If Russia is the aggressor, I don't think Finland would declare a war against Russia just because NATO is attacked. And why should we? But if it's EU that is under attack, that really complicates things. Then that would most likely be the case. But if the case was that Russia decided to start an all-out war against Europe, we would be screwed anyhow, member or not a member.

&gt;Your status as nonmember also forces your country to spend more on defense than NATO members. You also increased your defense spending after Russia's annexation of Crimea, which you shouldn't had to do if you were a part of NATO. 

The cost doesn't worry me. Strong independent defence is one of the cornerstones of Finland. I would like to see the spending increased, actually. And just making everything NATO-compliant is expensive too, it's silly to pretend that we're hammering money with our conscription based system when overhauling it would cost a lot of money too.

&gt;he didn't risk an immediate war with NATO by annexing part of Crimea. So there's some de facto truth to what a Treaty can militarily do all by itself.

Oh, definitely. I agree completely. Of course there's no guarantee that everyone would respect Article 5 if it ever needs to be invoked, but it's definitely a huge deterrent.

&gt;Also, your army is not technically very advanced and relies mostly on conscripts. Further spending will be needed to bring your army up to par to a level capable of defending against Russia. Are you ready to support those expenses on your own?

First of all, our policy hasn't been to actually win a war against Russia. I don't think that would be possible even if Finland was turned to NK-style ""military first"" country. The idea has been to make it costly enough that an attack isn't likely now or in the near future. What in here is precious enough for Russia to attack us, when they know what kind of capabilites we have? I don't think there's anything in here now or in the near future that they would want to get badly enough to warrant an attack. Like we have already discussed, Finland is nothing like Ukraine or Georgia, so the same threat doesn't concern us.

And like I mentioned earlier, I'm ready to support higher defence expenses for our current model. Our current spending is [1.29% of our GDP](http://www.defmin.fi/en/tasks_and_activities/resources_of_the_defence_administration/finances/share_of_defence_budget_of_gdp). There's room for improvement. But also, the ""requirement"" for NATO is 2%, so that's also something that has to be considered.

**E:** To add, I don't think it being ""just a formality"" or the cost are reasons enough to make the decision. Especially when the estimates of the costs if we were to join depend a lot on whom you ask. Some say we would be spending a lot more, some say we would be spending less. (Which I seriously doubt, seeing how low our spending is now.) Also, the conscription is a good system IMO and there's been talk about ending it if we join. But that shouldn't probably be considered as a factor, since it's so uncertain. The Article 5 is a good reason, but I honestly don't think the pro of that is enough to countrer all the cons of joining.",null,0,null,1423637864,null,0,1423638106,0,cohxnyg,null,t3_2vfqjn,null,t1_cohxnyg,null,t1_cohwhys,null,null,null,1424526469,null,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4,null

The thessaloniki metro is one of the cases civil engineers all over the world are learning how not to do a project. And before you talk about german projects that are similar, yes there are. Berlins airport for example, the difference is how the population talks about it. You will find many germans ashamed of these projects and they are under big public scrutiny. 
Some greeks see it very similar, but way to many don't care.

&gt;&gt; Also several embankment dam who are working way below a normal effectivity rate and not to forget that there are roads to freaking every ""secret"" and uninhabited beach there is.

&gt; true

Well at least we agree on the obvious ones.

&gt;&gt; Okay here is why i have a problem with that. Turkey actually became that kind of country. They still have a low wage etc. but they do have a way better growth rate and came better out of the crisis. In Fact, almost everyone there has a way lower average wage, not only Turkey. This leads to them manufacturing the clothes, the food and the machines that once were made in Greece. Greece minimum wage triples their northern neighbors, things can't work out that way.

&gt; Turkey DID become this right after Greece collapsed. Turkey is ruled by a half-crazy dictator guy. I'd rather be poor and free than live under Turkish conditions honestly.

This is not entirely true. Turkey did not receive the same funding greece did, but their rise to economic power began 2001, clearly before the bubble bursted.
I do agree that Turkeys politics are batshit insane, however we didn't talk about that. We are talking about the fact that the medium wage in greece is unsustainable high in relation to their neighbors. 

&gt; I agree with that. Especially agriculture should shift from cotton to other things esp. edibles for the local market. EU subsidies for cotton have made the Greek farmers extremely spoiled in the last 30 years (and now really poor too for the most part).

So what is the solution? Give them more money so they can stay uncompetitive? Protectionism? Import quotas? I very much doubt that that is the solution.

&gt;&gt;We both can agree, that there was a huge greek bubble that inflated both average wage and - which is worse - let the cronys profit like hell.

&gt;Oh yes for sure we agree on that. The problem is that when the bubble burst, the cronys floated and the average person got destroyed. That was the worst part.

Which is the normal result of a bubble and which is why Germany is not eager to create a new one and before the very often mentioned structural reforms are done we will indeed create one by giving greece the money they want.

&gt; I was just saying that German rebuilding was an effort of people from different backgrounds. Similar to the Greek years of economic growth (many migrant workers etc).

I am still not sure what you are alluding to. Should we have not gotten those workers or what is the point of this. As for the effort - they got paid for it, you know? That is how a working relationship works. People want to produces goods and pay others to do it for them. 

&gt; Not instead and not a bubble. Creation of jobs has to be a first priority. 60% unemployment of young people do you understand this???

You can't even tell me in what greece should invest in, so i am a bit sceptical how you want to create employment without artificially blowing already existing sectors up to a bubble.


&gt; So we have to shut up afraid that we will anger our masters? I think not... The Irish can do whatever they want.

You get way to emotional in this. This is not a slave/master relationship, but one of a friend that lend you money and you are now despising for... lending you money. Which is also why you should never lend friends money in the first place. Bad blood will arise in no time.

&gt; The ECB decision was at least questionable. As an independent EU institution they should not be affected by 'rumors' and 'discussions'. But well, asking for fairness is overplayed anyway.

By falling in this victim role greece does not do anything good for itself.

&gt; That's what your media probably tell you. Others[1] might disagreek.

Others might not know what they are talking about. Saying that Merkel is an ideologist is just crazy. Women quotas, energy transition from nuclear to regenerative and tons of other projects like rising the minimum wage are not right wing in any way. Actually because she is so centristic we had the rise of a party right from the CDU/CSU. As i said calling her an ideologist is utterly crazy.

&gt; Obviously any stimulus package should be extended to all EU countries especially of the 'periphery'. It would be great for all these countries to get some more $$$ so they can come to Greece for holidays and we can buy Finnish vodka or whatever they produce in Slovakia.

This is not financeable. 

&gt; Who should pay for all those marshall plans? Why should anyone believe that anyone would pay back their debts - at least in part?
&gt; All of the EU according to the profit they make in a similar way that New York or Texas pays a bit for Iowa or Nebraska. We need to recycle profits to keep the economy going.

The US is one country, quite frankly i don't see this working for the EU. Texas pays things for Iowa, because they feel obligated through patriotism to help their american brothers and sisters, i highly doubt that a transfer union works without a european patriotism. 

&gt; The US has a crazy amount of debt but so does the Eurozone. If you think that Germany is better off by itself then we should dissolve it. But having a EU and a Eurozone in which so many countries have no say about fiscal rules and when they try to democratically talk they are shunned as thieves, well that is not a way to run a UNITED Europe. If we wanted to be German colonies there were chances earlier in our history multiple times. Sometimes maybe we just need to eat the losses and clean our own house the hard way. I just don't want to see that happen because if that happens, Ukraine will be a playground compared to what Greece will become.

Without the money greece got through the EU and the Eurozone its economy will collapse. Uniting Europe by antagonizing one of its core states is nothing more than double speak.

On top of that, because the moronic politicians were so blatant about stealing money with their mates, to keep the retards who'd vote for them calm and happy, they decided to turn the public sector into a EURO sinkhole, by creating positions in the public sector, with ridiculous wages and perks, with no predetermined prerequisites that would constitue someone eligible for the job or not, in which they'd hire directly those who'd be corrupted enough themselves to promise to vote for them in exchange of said job.

I hadn't been following it; I just ran into it when reading a [2013 article describing US frustration over NATO members constantly not funding militaries at promised levels](http://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2013/10/will-us-rebalance-its-contribution-nato/72281/):

&gt; In 2006, the 28 members of NATO agreed to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. According to NATO records, by 2012 only four members met this bare minimum standard; the United States, Great Britain, Greece, and Estonia. During the Cold War, the U.S. accounted for roughly 50% of defense spending by NATO members. Now after years of shrinking defense budgets in Europe, the U.S. share is more than 75%.
&gt;
&gt; It is a priority for both President Obama and Hagel to convince our allies to take specific actions to fulfill their alliance commitments. This point will be communicated to them this week and at every top NATO meeting leading up to the summit next year in London. This is not an issue the Obama administration can walk away from. In fact, criticism of the excessive dependence on U.S. capabilities by NATO allies is one of the few issues that enjoys widespread bipartisan support in Congress. If U.S. allies continue to ignore the gravity of this problem, it is inevitable that the day will come when the United States will stop payment on their security credit card.
&gt;
&gt;The Obama administration began moving in this direction when it chose to “lead from behind” in Libya and limited the use of important U.S. enablers such as unmanned aircraft and A-10 war planes. The administration already crossed the threshold, but changed its mind, when it initially asked the French military to pay for the use of U.S. air transports for the French mission in Mali.
&gt;
&gt;The European members of NATO are geographically closer and arguably more vulnerable than the U.S. to the growing violence and instability across the Mediterranean, the Sahel, and the Middle East. Unless significant progress is made to fairly live up to their defense commitments, Europe will have to deal with these threats with a decreasing amount of U.S. military support.",null,0,null,1423638678,null,0,1423638865,0,cohxwyt,null,t3_2vfqjn,null,t1_cohxwyt,null,t1_cohxs53,null,null,null,1424526586,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

They're just using more brutal tactics to achieve their means than what we are used to in post-Soviet times. But I think there's valid reasons behind both Ukraine and Georgia, though that absolutely doesn't justify the wars. 

&gt;""Our city is too close to your country"" is a really stupid reason to invade a country

You have to take into account the time when this happened. Even I as a Finn can say that it was very valid reason for it. Finland and Soviet Union had a lot of bad blood. We had fought a civil war against communists, there were a lot of anti-communists and almost fascist people in goverment and were involved in wars against Soviet Union fairly recently. Of course those weren't the only reasons, but those were the reasons that make very much sense from their POV.

&gt;All I'm saying is, I don't trust Putin to not invade any given nearby country at this point.

I trust him enough not to attack without a reason. Ukraine and Georgia were and are very different from Finland in many respects. What made them vulnerable and into targets is mostly absent when it comes to Finland or Sweden.

&gt;Thus, the original point that spawned this thread, ""But a Russian attack on the Nordics is incredibly unlikely"", I'm just not so convinced of that, and it is something that worries me a bit. I hope that the poster is right, and my concerns are totally misfounded, but it does weigh on my mind.

I'm not worried. I honestly don't think there's a serious risk of an invasion now or in near future.

Die Öffentlichkeit habe von den Behörden nicht genug Informationen darüber bekommen, wie gefährlich Kotsabas Tätigkeit und seine Veröffentlichungen seien. ""Allerdings, wenn wir die Gesamtsituation betrachten, ist die Pressefreiheit in der Ukraine auf dem hohen Niveau, eindeutig viel weiter als in Russland"", sagt Tomilenko.

Man hätte stattdessen auch eine Solidaritätsadresse an den ukr. Jounalistenkollegen erwarten können oder gar einen Aufruf, ihn freizulassen.

&gt;The reduction in military spending is a common theme across Europe. Five years ago, according to NATO figures, France’s military budget amounted to 2.4 percent of its G.D.P.; this past year, it stood at 1.9 percent, and France’s budget law orders no increase before 2019. As for Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, it spends only 1.3 percent of its G.D.P. on defense.

&gt;So far, with the exception of the NATO members neighboring Russia, the Baltic nations and Poland, no one is even talking about hitting the 2 percent target.

I don't think it's that simple. Of course we must be cautious of our neighbor, but I don't think that's the main reason. Of course severing economical and political ties is something that must not be taken lightly, but I think the reason so many are agains is that we don't really see the benefits outweighing the negatives.

Why join and anger them, causing possible economic and political distress to us, when we don't feel threatened? Russia attacking us, or Sweden, seems incredibly unlikely, and I don't think that's enough of a reason to join, not even close. Especially when most of the factors that made Georgia and Ukraine/Crimea possible are absent when it comes to Finland. We have a strong standing army, stable government, very little Russian immigrant population, we're part of the EU, we were never part of the USSR and so on.

I honestly don't think we have anything to worry.

(And I would be pretty sceptical of us ""coming around to"" the YES vote. From what I remember, the poll I quoted was taken during the whole Crimea thing, but it actually went down after it.

There are many awesome Lego buildings close to the entrance but don't spend too much time looking at them while the rides are still open.

People keep on talking about the expense of weapons programs.  And they are expensive.

But they are not the cost drivers for most Western militaries.  It's always personnel and training.  With that in mind, it makes far, far more military sense to recapitalize warplanes and warships than maintaining a bunch of infantry.  It takes years to design, budget, manufacture, and deploy new weapons systems.  You could reasonably expect to raise tens of thousands of infantrymen in less than a year in comparison. 

If it takes, for instance, two years to rush job a modern destroyer assuming it's a copy of a existing one...it sorta behooves you to make sure you have a sufficient number of assets like that on hand when war breaks out, because who knows when you'll get a replacement for it.  

EDIT:  For example, you mentioned planes.  The UK had to ask the USN to send patrol aircraft to the UK because they had retired all of their maritime patrol aircraft without replacements and there was no way to track a suspected Russian sub in UK waters.

How about this. Isolationism is out of the question *forever*, as it is an outdated ideology that didn't work *at all* when the US tried it. Its gone. Done. Examples:



World War 1: US is minding its business, not at all involved in the clusterfuck of a war that was WW1. And then one day, a telegram arrived on Americas doorstep. 



It was Great Britain informing us that they intercepted a transmission headed for Mexico from Germany. It was a request from Germany that Mexico should surprise attack the United States, in an effort to keep the US out of WW1 (Which the US had no intention of joining). In exchange, once Germany was done conquering Europe, Germany would come over and help Mexico reclaim its lost territory from the Mexico-American War, and then some. 


Mexico ultimately replied that it was not interested in enraging the United States again.




WW2: I shouldn't even have to say this but, *Pearl Harbor*....


Your vision of the US not being engaged with Europe on every level possible, is a dud.



Give it up, Ron Paul.

Ça appartenait à une vieille hippie à moitié sénile (mais pour qui j'ai beaucoup d'estime) qui avait une maison absolument immense au bord d'une jungle à Hawaï dans laquelle elle avait fait construire cinq petites cabanes très, euh, rustiques qu'elle louait à des vacanciers aventureux sur Airbnb jusqu'à ce que les autorités nous forcent à retirer notre listing du site. On bossait une dizaine d'heures par semaine en échange de quoi on payait pas de loyer, le mec en question était homme à tout faire et moi je m'occupais des réservations et de nettoyer les cahutes.

Il était venu vivre à Hawaï quelques mois avant moi pour se mettre un peu au vert après de gros chamboulements dans sa vie: jusqu'à la crise de 2008 il avait des maisons, des grosses bagnoles et gérait plusieurs petites entreprises, puis les affaires n'ont plus été, les banques ont presque tout saisi, il a perdu le reste lors de son divorce, et pour couronner le tout il s'est niqué le genou à moto. Riches to rags en deux ou trois ans. Du coup il passait des journées coolax pour la première fois de sa vie, à boire du café en regardant la mer et en discutant au téléphone avec ses amis restés sur le continent. Et comme moi aussi je suis un gars assez peinard, on a eu de longues conversations et on a bien accroché.

Après on a quitté Hawaï pour bourlinguer un peu chacun de notre côté (moi en faisant mes traductions, lui en écrivant et en faisant publier son premier roman - hallucinant, ce mec, d'ailleurs je viens de finir ledit roman qui est atrocement mal écrit, mais merde quoi, il a été jusqu'au bout et ça mérite des tonnes de respect), mais on s'appelle souvent et on s'est croisés plusieurs fois depuis, notamment pour faire le trajet Floride-Minnesota en camionnette. Là il était retourné à Hawaï dans l'espoir d'avoir un ""vrai"" boulot et gagner un peu plus que ses 700 dollars par mois de sécurité sociale, mais au final c'est un truc un peu foireux qui marche à la commission et en plus il vient de voir une autre vendeuse claquer devant lui, alors non merci.",null,0,null,1423642879,null,0,1423643230,0,cohz0r8,null,t3_2vii0u,null,t1_cohz0r8,null,t1_cohynuq,null,null,null,1424527147,null,17,false,france,t5_2qhjz,17,null

a legit reason would also be to carry your knives to a place in the inner city that maybe sharpens them for you - but again you're not supposed to carry them like you're rambo in the jungle. common sense goes a long way...

Vale a dire che potevano compromettere l'account:

* Per Android, con accesso fisico al telefono per trenta secondi, andando nelle informazioni del telefono e prendendo l'IMEI
* Per iOS, facendolo collegare a un access point sotto il controllo dell'attaccante. Questo si può avvicinare al tuo caso.

Detto questo *quasi sicuramente* con gli aggiornamenti hanno anche aggiornato le vecchie password generate in modo non sicuro.

Oggi con MAC spoofing ci fai poco, servirebbe eventualmente per rubarti e analizzare i pacchetti (sempre assumendo che l'access point sia antagonista), ma ruberesti pacchetti cifrati.

AFAIK fino a poco tempo fa cifravano con RC4 (considerato debole), ma ora usano TextSecure con AES-256. In ogni caso anche rompere RC4 è un lavoro enorme e che richiede conoscenze avanzate, quindi possiamo escluderlo.

Lets not forget that Greece was growing rapidly with Portugal under euro all the way till 2008. It's largest trade partners being eurozone countries under strong euro. Then came the inevitable economic shakedown and it showed the rotten, old fashioned engine, and government that was not using its growth to pay its debt. It has now returned to times in the early euro days. 

Greece was offered loans by IMF and Eurozone under the market interest rate. Ireland was able to come back from and now recently Portugal has been able to switch its loans to interest rate offered by the market. How it should be. 

Of course putting Greece under such a magnifying glass is not nice.

Depends a lot on the property. You should find an online simulator and compare buying vs renting.

Let's say you buy a 400k€ condo. You'll have to pay roughly 27k€ in taxes. Then every year you'll have to pay the ""taxe foncière"", which will be roughly 2k€. Do the math and you'll know :)

On a tous des poils autour de nos neurones, des blonds, des bruns, des roux, des gris, des frisés, des drus, des longs, des courts, des gras, des secs. T'as beau essayer de les épiler y'en a toujours des nouveaux qui poussent.

Les problèmes arrivent quand tu crois que t'aime bien un truc alors qu'en fait c'est tout autre chose qui te plait. Genre un type qui croit qu'il aime bien la musique classique alors qu'en fait il aime bien se faire mousser en société. Il n'y a pas besoin d'un pouvoir centralisé pour ça. Prend le style de vie hipster, par exemple. C'est attrayant, mais c'est potentiellement une vie entière passée à se mentir, à renier des trucs qui nous plaisent vraiment ou à se forcer à apprécier des trucs chiants, pour la seule raison que notre neurone rebelle a les poils qui débordent.

Ca dépend de ton matos et de ton montage. J'utilise depuis pas mal de temps un Magma (un dripper par Paradigm) entre 0.3 et 0.5 ohm sur un mod mécanique en cuivre, j'ai un excellent rendu de saveur et une densité de vapeur tout à fait convenable.

*Edit:* et d'ailleurs pas besoin d'aller aussi bas pour avoir un bon rendu, c'est juste mes goûts, le résultat peut-être très bon aussi à 1, 1,2 ou 1,8 ohm.

J'ai aussi un clone de mauvaise qualité de plumeveil, avec une très bonne quantité de vapeur sur des liquides 100% VG.

Je ne connais pas le matériel que tu as en ce moment, mais si tu es sur des clearo ""de base"" (hors dernières sorties d'Aspire/Kanger type nautilus, aerotank ou atlantis), tu vas largement sentir la différence, il te faudra juste un peu de temps pour appréhender le montage de résistance avant d'avoir de bons résultats parce que la qualité de vape va dépendre de ton montage -du moment que ton atomiseur n'est pas de mauvaise qualité), mais arriver à maitriser la construction d'un micro-coils (par exemple) c'est relativement rapide et les résultats sont très très bons.

&gt;Et a quelle fréquence tu dois remonter le bouzin?

Idem, ça dépend du matériel, de comment tu vapes et du liquide: je dois changer le coton tous les 2 jours avec du boba's bounty qui caramélise et a vite un gout dégueu (je vape beaucoup ceci dit), mais sinon le coton tient une bonne semaine, la résistance ça peut tenir 2/3 semaines si je change pas trop de liquide, après ça je le fais par acquis de conscience mais il y a des gens qui les gardent plusieurs mois.

The fact you acknowledge the German intelligence programs shows me you are more level headed than many of the people this article is speaking about though. It seems like many Europeans with bend over backwards to ignore what their intelligence agencies are doing in favor of pinning the problem squarely on the US/UK. 

As far as Russia goes, Germany is a very major power, and the largest economy in Europe. It is one of the largest economies in the world, and in many respects is considered the spokesperson for the EU. When it comes to Russia or similar situations people expect a German response. When it comes to situations within the EU like the Greek debt crisis people obviously expected a German response. Those people could be your neighbors and EU partners or the US. Inaction can sometimes be interpreted as definitively as action. So many people would read Germany doing nothing as an endorsement or at least being indifferent to Russia's actions. It is the Catch-22 of being a major power. You will be criticized regardless of what you do. 

I would say that situation is more acute for the US, but Germany is beginning to realize inaction is no longer an option. For example, a couple years ago those on this sub were strongly in favor of the US not getting involved in foreign conflicts. I read a thread today endorsing the arming of Ukraine. I met a Kurdish-Canadian girl in Turkey that said the US needed to learn to stay out of the affairs of others, and later she posted a picture of her marching at an anti-ISIS rally in Toronto with a sign ""USA Wake Up"". Libya and Bosnia are two issues the US was trying to stay out of but EU inaction prompted a response. I only point this out because people will always say the US should stay out of things, but then those same people will be the first to deride the US for inaction as well. Getting involved in every conflict because more interested parties refuse will produce hypocritical results on occasion.

To what extend would they say the EU at their level of power is completely corruption-free, and how does it relate to lobbying (perhaps make some comparisons with the situation in the US which, although legal, has some very serious regarding the dependencies of some bodies on lobbying-money). But please ask the lobbying part in a separate question, and make the first question more like ""is there no corruption?"" rather than ""is there corruption?"". 


How is the general atmosphere between the different parliament members? Are friendly relations based on nationality, ideology or personality? How are relations between, say, Greek and German parliament members? What about between Eastern and Western European parliament members?


If there is one thing they could change in how the EU works on their level, what would it be? (Please ask multiple)


In their eyes, would the EU and its citizens benefit from more democracy for closer ties to the people, or less democracy for better efficiency pushing through unpopular but necessary laws? (Without making any judgement on any particular law in consideration at the moment).


Their income is quite high (I don't have the figures exactly, but especially those in parliament earn quite a whole lot). Do they genuinely believe their income is what they deserve? If so, Why?

Inoltre poteva anche capitare l'episodio in cui degli slavi, vedendo degli italiani, pensassero subito ""ah, questi sporchi fascisti!"" e li ammazzassero senza pensarci troppo, e va a finire che quelli non erano fascisti per nulla e ci erano andati di mezzo innocentemente (o viceversa, eh).

Wat?

Greece has been running a huge budget deficit [since at least 1995](http://data.oecd.org/chart/4f6Q) (if I remember right, it was way worse in the 1980's and early 90's) and its level of total deficit (private + state) was unhealthy [since at least 1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HellenicOeconomy%28inCurrentEuros%29.png).

The Greek government pretty much stole money from its citizens by regularly devaluating the Drachma to finance this deficit. Everyone knew this was no longer possible under the Eur regime, everyone.

The rules of the eurozone were agreed on by all participants before and were public - 2% inflation target ([Greece since 1980](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=gkcpnewy&amp;d1=19800101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;h=500&amp;w=800&amp;ref=/greece/inflation-cpi)), 3% budget deficit and 60% total govt deficit.

No one held a shotgun to Greece's head and forced them in. While one huge error on the side of the rest of the Eur-zone was letting Greece join, first and foremost Greece's politicians ought to have told their folk that they either have to have *painful* reforms or cannot join. Besides, I'd really like to know what kind of outcry there had been if the Northern Eur country had told the South that they are not invited - You are dividing the EU! Rich countries want all for themselves! etc.

So, either it was a conscious decision by Greek's ruling class to feed their countries to the dogs or they just did not care.",null,0,null,1423645966,null,0,false,0,cohzp8j,null,t3_2vhmh0,null,t1_cohzp8j,null,t1_cohr8bx,null,null,null,1424527464,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Putting aside all the benefits from added cooperation (joint-readiness, operational efficacy,...) consider the *Common Security and Defence Policy*. 

--

The 2009 Treaty of Lisbon renamed the institution and included the follow line:


--

&gt;The common security and defence policy shall include the progressive framing of a common Union defence policy. This will lead to a common defence, when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides[.] The policy of the Union in accordance with this article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states, which see their common defence realised in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, under the North Atlantic Treaty, and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework.

--


The 2009 Lisbon Treaty led to the termination of the Western European Union in 2010 with the solidarity clause (deemed to supersede the WEU's military mutual defence clause). Effectually creating an EU 'Article V' (although it hasn't be tested). 

--

Now consider the joint-task-forces of neighboring states (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, etc). In the event of Sweden and Finland *need* defensive partners they'll likely already be task-force training/operations ongoing; furthered by requisite action on behalf of the neighboring states. Treaties and obligations of the EU aside any event in which Sweden and Finland would a need mutual defense pact the Baltics and Poland would be under threat (because, let's be real here, it's be Putin doing the incursion). 

--

Be it through the strategic necessity of the Baltics and NATO or intervention by a fellow EU member-state through the Common Security and Defence Policy NATO, and with it the United States, would be dragged in.

Muro contro muro

il governo annuncia misure lacrime e sangue

la strada è tutta in salita

il tempo stringe

siamo con l’acqua alla gola

siamo nell'occhio del ciclone

le forze dell’ordine hanno agito con professionalità

fuori dal tunnel

non abbassiamo la guardia

l’indice d’ascolto è stato un tonfo

è iniziato il contro esodo

chiedere scusa

il contesto globale

in quest'ottica

si assumano le loro responsabilità

a trecentosessanta gradi

va focalizzato

la piccola e media impresa

è nel nostro DNA

è calato nei sondaggi

al minimo storico

su base annua

giovani e meno giovani

dove lo stato non è presente

una vera chicca

si sono chiamati fuori

si sta ancora scavando in cerca di altre vittime

le sinergie presenti sul territorio

nel mirino degli inquirenti

la fuga dei cervelli

subito le riforme e poi andiamo al voto

le soglie di povertà

una gigantesca caccia all'uomo

sotto la lente di Bruxelles

le fasce a rischio

di tutto e di più

tutto e il contrario di tutto

le criticità

gli uomini-radar

l'emergenza rifiuti

la microcriminalità

la stragrande maggioranza degli italiani

il made in italy

l'impatto ambientale

sette chilometri di coda

incasso record

un'europa che guarda al futuro

più fondi per la ricerca

puntare sui giovani

bisogna partire dal territorio

è iniziato il contro esodo

stuprata dal branco

dare un segnale forte

le sostanze dopanti

liberalizzare le droghe leggere

varato il piano

la strada è tutta in salita

si commenta da sé

ci sono luci e ombre

le quote rosa

bere molta acqua

gli intrecci mafia-politica

il presunto assassino

la malasanità

si tratta di un errore umano

molta frutta e verdura

a tasso zero

per il bene del paese

è un far west

è un film dell'orrore

è il Bill Gates/Steve Jobs/Mark Zuckerberg italiano

l'ospizio-lager

non arrivano alla fine del mese

la costituzione più bella del mondo

sull'orlo dell'abisso

è stato segregato

il lato B

è giallo

al vaglio degli inquirenti

in ginocchio

mette in luce

sotto le lenzuola

grido di allarme

non ha dato esito

preso il killer

offre uno spaccato

in dolce attesa

ha provocato un terremoto

non ci sono italiani tra le vittime

una faida

uno tsunami

fa discutere la proposta

nel mirino

rush finale

alla sbarra

scende in campo

si è tolto la vita

il rebus

è bufera

è bagarre

bocche cucite

è polemica

il cerchio magico

il blitz è scattato alle prime luci dell'alba

poteva essere una strage

una coltre di neve si è abbattuta

vivo per miracolo

in manette

al fresco

comincia la kermesse

massimo riserbo

severo monito da parte del capo dello stato

il teatrino della politica

teatro di guerra

il transatlantico

raggiunto da un avviso di garanzia

ma anche tanta gente comune

la colonnina di mercurio segna che

la morsa del gelo

e veniamo al calcio giocato

ma voltiamo decisamente pagina

conflitto a fuoco

visita lampo

in tilt

il santo padre

ha annunciato

il grande esodo

banco di prova

giro di vite

salto nel buio

in avanzato stato di decomposizione

indagini a 360 gradi

a piede libero

occhi puntati su

lady

blindato

l'orco

null,false,Puchoco_Voluspa,GREE,Greece,null,"&gt;Forgive my ignorance, but hasn't Syriza promised to stop the layoffs I the public sector and even rehire people?

Yes they did promise that. But they also started hinting towards reduced wages across the board for the vast majority of public sector employees as well. And on top of that they claim that they want to reintroduce a form of inspection, by some committee that will judge just how productive each employee is and whether or not he/she is truly needed.

IF, again **IF**, they actually do that, then the productivity of the public sector in Greece will literally sky rocket (both due to reduced wages and to the fact that publicly owned companies will now operate fucking efficiently for once)! Again, that's a huge IF. 

Moreover, the vast majority of those who were laid off were people who did not occupy jobs with high wages ( like the famous by now cleaning ladies in the ministry of finance ). They were just the scapegoats of a government who didn't really want to touch on those public sector ""golden boys"". In the mean time the party in the public sector was still going strong.

So to wrap things up, **IF** Syriza introduces a formal list of prerequisities for each position in the public sector, **IF** they select in a fair way among candidates with no regard whatsoever about the candidate's political tendencies, **IF** they form an incentive mechanism design that will ensure such a committee will remain politically impartial, **IF** they monitor the public sector employees and maybe link wages to productivity, then **MAYBE** our god damn public sector will be efficient again after an entire fucking century or so!

En France, une partie de la population et les élites sont terrifiées par les effets potentiels d'une véritable démocratie. C'est aussi parce qu'ils imaginent qu'une démocratie plus développée devrait comprendre autant d'arbitraire, d'illusions sur la ""sagesse des gouvernants"" ou de pouvoirs sur l'individu que l'oligarchie actuelle. 

A l'heure actuelle, l'Etat peut se permettre de confisquer quasi-arbitrairement tous les droits d'un individu sur la demande d'un ministre. J'en reviens souvent à l'affaire Coupat, mais les successions de procès et de condamnations pour des individus ayant dit des choses pas très fines liées aux derniers attentats sont une preuve supplémentaire de l'arbitraire pur dans lequel on se retrouve aujourd'hui.

On pourrait aussi parler des multiples bureaucraties encombrantes ou de toutes les situations où le citoyen ordinaire est complètement impuissant face à un Etat et des pouvoirs publics qui considèrent qu'un individu est là pour servir la ""communauté"", pas l'inverse. 

Donc je comprends que les types qui font le quotidien de cette machine flippe à l'idée que des masses d'individus puissent avoir le même pouvoir qu'eux, mais atomisé par la masse. Il y a aussi le principe selon lequel le peuple est trop con, inculte, ignorant, et qu'on ne peut pas laisser M. Tout-le-monde décider du sort de la nation.

To be sure, mistakes were made by Portugal, Greece and other countries, but the root of the debt crisis was the financial crisis that undermined confidence in the banking sector and forced countries to borrow heavily to save the banks. This is clearly a systemic crisis of the international financial system that has revealed underlying fragilities of the common currency. It still amazes me how smoothly the media have been able to shift the blame from the irresponsible finance sector to the nations who responsibly saved their economies from collapse.

Tu sais, moi je ne crois pas qu'il y ait des situations où ça va et d'autres où ça ne va pas.

Et c'est assez curieux de se dire que les hasards, les rencontres forgent une destinée. Parce que quand on a le goût de la chose, quand on a le goût de la chose bien faite, le beau geste, parfois on ne trouve pas l'interlocuteur en face, je dirais le miroir qui t'aide à avancer.
Alors ce n'est pas mon cas, comme je disais là, puisque moi au contraire j'ai pu, et je dis merci à la vie, je lui dis merci, je chante la vie, je danse la vie, je ne suis qu'amour. Et finalement quand beaucoup de gens aujourd'hui me disent : « Mais comment fais-tu pour avoir cette humanité ? » eh bien je leur réponds très simplement, je leur dis : « C'est ce goût de l'amour », ce goût donc, qui m'a poussé aujourd'hui à entreprendre une construction mécanique, mais demain qui sait ?

It's because of Russia's bluster that I'm not concerned. They hold very few cards. We're witnessing the death-throes of a leader trapped in his office; the reforms necessary for national success, or Putin stepping down, would result in his own execution -- he's stolen billions of dollars from his own people, killed his own citizens, and operates a criminal network. He's backed into a corner, and sure, that can be dangerous -- but his goal is survival. So he's not going to launch a massive war that see's him, and his country, disposed.

Houlala, ça fait du bien de lire que je suis pas la seule à être comme ça. Je n'estime pas avoir une vie 'malheureuse', au contraire, mais ça me fait toujours bizarre quand je vois les gens autour de moi faire un top 10 de leurs meilleurs moments pendant que moi je rebondis de petits plaisirs en petits plaisirs.

Concernant la peur de la mort, j'étais comme ça aussi avant - l'idée que tout puisse s'arrêter d'un coup, que mes proches puissent disparaître sans que je puisse les voir une dernière fois me bouffait vraiment l'esprit. J'ai étrangement été amenée à tout relativiser il y a 2 ans quand je suis tombée malade et ai du passer par la case chimio - j'ai réalisé qu'on ne contrôlait pas grand chose aux événements, que le plus important était de profiter de chaque moment, même les pires.

EVERYTHING else in economics is pure bullshit and wishful thinking that results from someone's bias pro or against some sort of agenda. Stephen Hawking had it right, economics is nothing short of an effective theory.

Anyone who has dared to dive into econometrics, be it because he/she is a mazochist or because he/she wanted to get some results, realized this hard fact when the rigorousness of σ-algebras is followed by the great leaps of faith that we need to take in order for a model to spit back results.

&gt;

&gt;__Key exchange__ (also known as ""key establishment"") is any method in [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) by which [cryptographic keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography\)) are exchanged between users, allowing use of a cryptographic [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm).

&gt;If sender and receiver wish to exchange encrypted messages, each must be equipped to encrypt messages to be sent and decrypt messages received. The nature of the equipping they require depends on the [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) technique they might use. If they use a [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code), both will require a copy of the same [codebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebook). If they use a [cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher), they will need appropriate keys. If the cipher is a [symmetric key cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_key), both will need a copy of the same key. If an [asymmetric key cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key) with the public/private key property, both will need the other's public key.

According to the [Metro] (http://www.metro.hu/public/home) store in 2013 it was enough for a person in a week to buy 1kg rice; 0,5 kg noodles; 0,5 kg lard; 0,2 l sour creme; 6 potato; 4 apples; 1 tomato; 1 pepper and an onion. - [source] (http://hvg.hu/gazdasag/20141015_Ennyit_eszik_egy_szegeny_magyar_hetente) &amp; [picture] (http://www.kiskegyed.hu/lapokkepek/cikkek/58000/58160_szegenymagyar.jpg)

Some of the scientists don't like this as an indicator of poverty, they prefer the 60 percent of the median incomes as a poverty line. That would mean 1,500,000 Hungarian below that line opposed to 4,000,000 Hungarians living under the living wage.(2011 data)

EDIT: By definition it is absolute poverty I suppose, but I am not a sociologist.

Les [ecig rechargeables entrée de gamme](http://www.ecigadvanced.com/faqs/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ego-clearomizer.jpg) (souvent appelées eGo, nom de la connexion entre la batterie et l'atomiseur) ou les [cigalikes](http://www.vaporlook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/electronic-cigarette.jpg) sont faites de matériaux peu chers, ont parfois un gout de plastique et polluent l'environment étant donné qu'on jète l'atomiseur (ce qui contient le liquide, la résistance et le support qui amène le liquide à la résistance, souvent de la fibre de silice) que l'on voit à gauche sur la première photo.

Le rendu de saveur n'est pas aussi bon que sur des reconstructibles, mais le prix est très correct et il sont très simples d'utilisation. Toutefois on a vu arriver des atomiseurs avec des resistances changeables, qui sont utilisables par des gens qui débutent avec la ecig, et qui ont un formidable rendu, je pense au [nautilus](http://www.lepetitvapoteur.com/clearomiseur-stardust-ego/601-aspire-nautilus.html), à [l'areotank](http://www.lepetitvapoteur.com/clearomiseur-stardust-ego/760-mega-aerotank-kanger.html) ou au [subtank](http://www.lepetitvapoteur.com/clearomiseur-stardust-ego/1302-subtank.html). C'est ce que je conseillerais à des gens qui sont motivé(e)s pour arrêter la clope et qui veulent essayer la ecig.

A côté de ça, on a les atomiseurs reconstructibles, où il faut refaire soi-même la resistance (à l'aide de fil résistif et de coton/fibre de silice/mesh/...), destinés à des gens expérimentés, qui ont bien souvent un rendu largement supérieur, mais nécessitent un peu plus d'investissement autant financier que de temps. Quelques exemples: le [kayfun](http://www.planetofthevapes.co.uk/sites/default/files/guides/listing/xresdef_enl.jpg) et le [fogger](http://www.lepetitvapoteur.com/reparables/1193-fogger-v5.html) (qui ont un réservoir), le [mephisto](http://www.lepetitvapoteur.com/reparables/1008-mephisto.html) (qui n'en a pas, on appelle ça un dripper).

On les utilise avec des mods (qui vont contenir la batterie), qu'ont divise en deux groupes, les éléctroniques qui intègrent un circuit éléctronique, et qui permettent de choisir la tension/la puissance de sortie. Un exemple est le [vamo](http://www.lepetitvapoteur.com/mod-electro/1156-vamo-v5.html), un très bon début quand on commence dans les mods plus avancés que les eGo, mais on a aussi des [trucs](http://www.lepetitvapoteur.com/mod-electro/1192-box-50w-sigelei.html) plus évolués. Il existe aussi les mécaniques, qui sont techniquement des tubes à pile et qui ne font que sortir la puissance de la batterie qui est dedans, un bon exemple est le [magneto](http://www.lepetitvapoteur.com/-natural/1080-magneto-smoktech.html), mais on peut avoir des produits plus travaillés, sur le même site on trouve le [stingray X](http://www.lepetitvapoteur.com/-natural/1182-mod-stingray-x-titanium.html). Les mécaniques nécessitent une bonne connaissance, je ne les conseille pas (**VRAIMENT** pas) quand on débute.

null,false,PostNationalist,ANAR,Sexually Socialist,null,"&gt;US President warns David Cameron that if Britain fails to meet its 2 per cent of GDP defence spending target, it will set a bad example to other European nations

Bad example? They're already not paying the 2 percent while the UK has kept it at 2 percent despite 5 years of austerity. The only countries that do are Turkey, Estonia and hilariously, Greece. 

At the end of the day increasing the military budget is the most sure-fire way to not get elected in May. Especially while the Greens are polling to either come the 3rd or 4th largest party in the UK and they advocate pulling out of NATO completely. 

The military is the least important thing to the average voter and an area politicians can slash budgets quite happily. 

But what's hilarious is that we could slash budgets to 0.4 percent of GDP with little real threat to the UK. Given the geopolitical environment the only countries going to be hit with possible invasion or turmoil or coups are the baltics, middle east and south america. 

So even if some nightmare scenario happened in which Russia invaded eastern europe and headed to annex western europe (as far fetched as it get's) the US would still deploy everything they've got in Western europe because there is no way they'd let their hegemony disappear (as least not yet anyway). 

So frankly increasing budgets in todays world doesn't make sense and if the off chance a series of unfortunate events leads to a conflict they'll be americans happy to die for our freedom anyway.

null,false,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,null,"&gt; While this is true to some extend, we are just below EU average, between Denmark and Sweden, so I would not worry too much about the infrastructure. 

It's unclear what that percentage means (public and/or private? what is counted as investment?).

Some articles detailing the point:

[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-18/merkel-budget-zeal-eroding-byways-as-german-infrastructure-rusts](the spending shortfall on upkeep of the transport network is running at about 4 billion euros a year)

[http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324096404578351721007786796](This month's closure of the Kiel Canal, a major international shipping lane, to fix badly worn-out locks has become a high-profile symbol of the decay. The closure to larger vessels, from March 6 until Thursday, was a first in the canal's 118-year history.)

&gt;Granted, in the current economical climate we should be investing way above average to pull the EUR zone out of recession.

Even just for its good... Focusing on the costs while ignoring the benefits of investment never made a business prosperous - and that counts double for a country, since countries are able to capture diffuse benefits too.

China doesn't do favors. Russians talked for a decade with them to build a gas pipe to China, but the Chinese said only yes after Kremlin had become very desperate and was willing to sell gas with deep discount. The same will happen with China and Greece. The Chinese will act very friendly towards the new Greek government with nods and winks, but they will not make a deal until the Greeks are desperate, then they suggest a deal, take-it-or-leave-it, that will be very costly to Greece.

What I am afraid is that Syriza leaders will end up selling the country and the future of the country for short term financial and political gains. Worse is that they might fail on doing so. Do remember what happened in Cyprus. The Cypriot banks were bankrupt long time before the climax of the Cypriot crisis and everybody knew it. EU and the ECB were trying to make the Cypriots to accept a bailout, but leadership didn't want it. After the leadership of Cyprus couldn't anymore hide the bankruptcy of the banks and the country, they tried to play West and Russia against each others in order to get financing with better conditions. At the end this lead to deterioration of the market situation and increased hard line of EU and IMF on conditions on financing the Cypriot bailout.

What is happening right now in Greece is a redux of Cyprus. The only thing that can save Greece is if they really have leaders who put the interest of Greece before the interest of themselves and their political career.",null,0,null,1423651542,null,0,false,0,coi0s4w,null,t3_2vis7o,null,t1_coi0s4w,null,t1_coi063i,null,null,null,1424527968,null,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17,null

Luxenburg become *de jure* independent in 1838 but still in personal union with the Netherlands until 1890 when due to different succession laws it passed to a different branch of House of Nassau.

**Andorra**: Some villages in a valley that were contested between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix (pretty the history of half of Europe during the middle age) at some point in 1278 they found an agreement to share the sovreignity over that valley. then stuff happenend (among them the Count of Foix becoming King of France and Andorra becoming *de facto* part of France) but nobody really ever bothered to incorporate into a bigger state and somewhat survived until now.


**Monaco**: Once a sea fortress of the Genoese Republic, then become independent under the Genoese Grimaldi Family under the protectorate  of the Duchy/Kingdom of Savoy/Sardinia/Piedmont. Just your average late medieval/early modern feudal princely state.

Then the area around Monaco wasceded by Piedmont to France in exchange for help in the wars against Austria. At this point the Prince of Monaco signed a treaty with France, giving 95% of his territory to the French in exchange for recognizing Monegasque sovereignity.


**Liechtenstein**: One of the many, many princely states that made up the Holy Roman Empire. At some point the Liechtenstein family vassals to the Habsburg that held many lands across Bohemia and Austria and playing a big role in the Viennese politics acquired it the County of Vaduz to gain Imperial immediancy that was somewhat like sovreignity but within the H.R.E.

In 1866-1871 Prussia transformed the loose German Confederacy into a unified nation called Germany. of the many states that formed the Confederacy just three did not unify in Germany: Luxemburg because it was *de facto* Netherlands, Austria because it was a great power and did not wanted to go under Prussia and Liechtenstein becaus it was basically a private property of an Austrian political family. Just after the end of the Hapsburg Empire in 1918 and with the annexation of Austria to Nazi Germani in 1938 the Liechtenstein Family moved to Vaduz and began to be primarly involved with the microstate issues.


**San Marino**: one of the many independent City States of Medieval Italy, not even the biggest of most important one. managed to not being annexed by the Papal States like the rest of Romagna region during late medieval-early modern period.

Then managed to not being annexed by newborn Italy during the 19th century by able political mouvering and due to gratitude by Garibaldi that managed to hide in San Marino while fleeting from the Papal States after a failed revolution.

**Vatican City**: After newborn Italy conquered the Papal State in 1871 they allowed the Pope to remain inside is Palace on the Vatican Hill without interfering but confiscating many other properties in Rome, among them the Quirinale Palace that was the main Papal residence and that become Royal and then Presidential residence of Italy.

Relations between the Pope and the Kingdom of Italy were tense for half a century until in 1929 Mussolini's fascist government signed a treaty that recognized independence to the territories within the Vatican walls thus creating the new State of Vatican City.

Un buon punto di partenza in generale per avventurarti su reddit è riferirsi alle linee guida della [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). Considera però che si tratta di suggerimenti generici, per come è strutturato reddit ogni sub fa un po' storia a sé, per cui troverai luoghi pesantemente moderati (tipo /r/askhistorians) e altri invece con una moderazione leggera o leggerissima (come /r/italy).

Per il nostro sub, le regole, presenti in sidebar, sono poche e chiare:

&gt; Benvenuto nella comunità italiana di reddit!
&gt; Welcome everyone! This is a place to post and discuss anything related to Italy (Italia!). We also speak English!
&gt; 
&gt; Condividere un articolo del tuo blog, una volta ogni tanto, se si è utenti attivi è cosa buona e giusta. Inserire (quasi) sempre e solo articoli del tuo blog è considerato spamming. Non siamo qui per promuovere il tuo blog o fare la tua propaganda.
&gt; 
&gt; Se noti un link che sembra spam o contro le regole, segnalacelo!
&gt; 
&gt; No calcio, azzurri esclusi ovviamente.
&gt; 

Come per ogni community online, la cosa migliore da fare è lurkare, lurkare, e ancora lurkare. 

Se hai dubbi o richieste specifiche puoi scrivere privatamente [ai mod](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fitaly), che in tempi ragionevoli ti daranno una risposta.

Yes and no, and they are part of the Lisbon treaty. 

However, the Lisbon treaty, consequently article 42-7, shall not collide with the security allignment of individual members. Finland, Sweden and Austria are officially neutral. 

What this means is that if Putin attacks Finland, he is at war with the entire EU. But if Putin attacks Poland, Sweden and Finland are not obligated to assist since they are neutral. 

They really fear Russia and have decided they will only think about themselves in the case of war, if they can avert it, they will. Even if continental Europe would fall.

Okay, c'è una giustificazione sensata, ma questo non significa che sia la forma corretta. 

&gt;Il termine d'alto bordo definisce la contiguità con il mondo dell'alta società. Di frequente nel lessico comune si tende a confondere la parola bordo con borgo, supponendo che si stia parlando dell'alta borghesia. Tale espressione è da considerarsi non corretta, in quanto l'etimologia del termine proviene dalla cultura marinaresca e non da altre origini. Si fa risalire infatti quest'espressione al linguaggio della marina che, un tempo, riferendosi ad una parte della nave, il bordo, e riferendosi alle navi più prestigiose, vedeva gli ufficiali risiedere proprio in quella parte dell'imbarcazione. Di lì l'avvicinamento del termine ad altre circostanze per significare: alto livello, alta classe, ecc.

Comunque, in un'analisi finale, l'italiano è una lingua in continua mutazione, ci sono dei termini sbagliati che vengono usati talmente tanto spesso da soppiantare, nel tempo, quelli corretti.

We had our best LOLs for decades now. A right-wing media mogul (Simicska) who was a staunch ally of Orbán blew up, called Orbán a douchebag in the media (geci, literally means sperm), yelled the media full with vulgarities ""Orbán is a douche. That other politician is a douche. My employees are a douche. I will fire everybody, fuck them."" 

This large happened because in a concerted effort many of his newspaper and TV channel employees had resigned because they wanted to be loyal to Orbán instead or dunno.

So now our governing right-wing has a huge in-fight, peppered with vulgarities, and it is very LOL worthy, because Orbán could easily make Simicska ""disappear"" in a Putin style, but Simicska knows a lot about the illegal stuff Orbán did and probably he has damning evidence hidden in some Swiss safe ""publish it in case something happened to me"", so there is no clear winner or loser of this. 

So it is very good our government side is basically killing itself, now all I want is for the opposition to do the same and then we could start over with a new political elite.

Oh, another LOL worthy thing is that some guy won a local council election, represting the right-extremist party Jobbik. It turned out he said something extremely racist things about the Roma, so the Jobbik president punished him by forcing him to live for 3 days at a Jobbik member who happens to be Roma (rare thing).

L'influenza esercitata dalle varie dominazioni è stata soprattutto culturale: esistono infatti cognomi di origine spagnola, francese, o anche aventi antiche radici linguistiche germaniche o longobarde. Questo non significa tuttavia che chi li porta oggi discende da uno di quei popoli.
Per chi vuole saperne di più sui cognomi è uscito di recente dai tipi di Laterza questo agile saggio: [Bizzocchi, I cognomi degli italiani](http://www.laterza.it/index.php?option=com_laterza&amp;Itemid=97&amp;task=schedalibro&amp;isbn=9788858117033).

It depends on what you want to use it for.  It probably is not fine as is for how you're trying to use it.

&gt;Libya was easy enough (Don't even start with the whole needing American support, one European country runs out of missiles and suddenly we're all incompetent).

Didn't say you're incompetent.  But you can't just wave that off.  The Libyan air defense network was knocked flat by the US on day one, and you guys *still* hit a munitions wall less than a month into it.  So we're to seriously expect that you guys have enough of a warstock to fight a major war against someone who can fight back?

Come on.

&gt;However pretending if the the EU really wanted to walk into the entire of North Africa and conquer it without American assistance would be to difficult is laughable.

No doubt in my mind they could do it.  Couldn't do it as easily as you seem to think though.  Like I said; you guys hit a wall in munitions availability less than a month in against a country whose air defense network had already been flattened by someone else.  So I'm to seriously think that you guys could pull off invading and conquering substantially harder nuts to crack easily?

France is obviously spending it's money better than the UK, since there were no reported munitions shortages.  I doubt they have enough to carry the entire EU effort in such a scenario, though.  One of the reasons why France has a independent nuclear deterrent is so that their defense isn't chained to the US.

 [**Battle of Öland**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20%C3%96land): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Battle of Öland__ was a naval battle between an allied [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark%E2%80%93Norway)-[Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic) fleet and the Swedish navy in the [Baltic Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea), off the east coast of [Öland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96land) on 1 June 1676.  The battle was a part of the [Scanian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanian_War) (1675–79) fought for supremacy over the southern Baltic. Sweden was in urgent need of reinforcements for its north German possessions; Denmark sought to ferry an army to [Scania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scania) in southern Sweden to open a front on Swedish soil.

&gt;Just as the battle began, the Swedish flagship *[Kronan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronan_(ship\))* sank, taking with it almost the entire crew, including the Admiral of the Realm and commander of the Swedish navy, [Lorentz Creutz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_Creutz). The allied force under the leadership of the Dutch admiral [Cornelis Tromp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelis_Tromp) took full advantage of the ensuing disorder on the Swedish side. The acting commander after Creutz's sudden demise, Admiral [Claes Uggla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claes_Uggla), was surrounded and his flagship *[Svärdet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sv%C3%A4rdet)* battered in a drawn-out artillery duel, then set ablaze by a [fire ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_ship). Uggla drowned while escaping the burning ship, and with the loss of a second supreme commander, the rest of the Swedish fleet fled in disorder.

&gt;The battle resulted in Danish naval supremacy, which was upheld throughout the war. The Danish King [Christian V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_V_of_Denmark) was able to ship troops over to the Swedish side of [the Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98resund), and on 29 June a force of 14,500 men landed at Råå, just south of [Helsingborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsingborg) in southernmost Sweden. Scania became the main battleground of the war, culminating with the bloody [battles of Lund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lund), [Halmstad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Halmstad) and [Landskrona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Landskrona). Danish and Dutch naval forces were left free to raze Öland and the Swedish east coast all the way up to Stockholm. The Swedish failure at Öland also prompted King [Charles XI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_XI_of_Sweden) to order a commission to investigate the fiasco, but in the end no one was found responsible.

Basically the haircut was for the middle class losing even more money and the Greek Social Security Funds got demolished after the haircut.)

Lesson 1: It makes no sense to haircut public debt to private bondholders if the private banks, that hold much of that debt, are to be recapitalised with funds that the government will have to borrow from the ESM. This smacks of a ‘revolving doors’ process for public debt, as proven in the case of Greece where the PSI reduced debt in 2012 by 13.4% only to boost it again in 2013 by 19.3% – as the recapitalisation funds were borrowed by the state to compensate the banks for their… PSI losses.

Exactly. I still lividly remember the beginning of 90s and the financial crisis we had. Politicians after politicians assured in the TV that the Finnish Mark would not be devalued, and then it was. What wasn't told then that the country relied at the worst moments to loans just from a one German bank and the government was ready to enact emergency legislation that would have forced our corporations to repatriate all money from abroad and restrict imports. Fortunately severe austerity at the end stabilized the situation.

Later on when hearing stories about the times, some people saw the signs and some didn't...  My friends dad was a CFO in a major Finnish retailer, he forced his wife, a bank manager, to convert all foreign currency loans to domestic loans just few months before the crash... Another friends family was quite rich with a machinery workshop of around 100 employees, they ordered the bank to convert their currency loans to domestic ones, but the bank went rogue, and didn't follow the order. They suffered huge losses when they had to sell almost all other assets to save the company, they succeeded on saving most of their fortunates, but they never recuperated to the same level...

Tu a s raison sur la décentralisation et le fait qu'il faut bien qu'il y ait une politique locale qui va forcément dépendre des affinités des élus.

Mais la gendarmerie n'est pas la police municipale. La police municipale n'a pas le droit d'intervenir comme la police nationale. Elle peut constater à peu près tout, mais ne peut intervenir que sur certaines contraventions. Le fait qu'elle ne soit normalement pas armée (pouvoir régalien : la gendarmerie dépend de l'armée, qui dépend directement du chef de l’État) a normalement pour effet justement qu'elle ne fasse pas ce qu'elle n'a pas le droit de faire.  

Mais désormais, l'appauvrissement des effectifs fait que les policiers municipaux sont souvent ceux qui sont confrontés en premier au pire, parfois, ils sont les seuls disponibles et certains  crèvent de trouille et demandent depuis longtemps à être armés.

&gt; Ber­lin. An­ge­sichts einer dra­ma­ti­schen Aus­rei­se­wel­le aus dem Ko­so­vo schlägt **die deut­sche Bot­schaft in Pris­ti­na** Alarm und for­dert me­di­en­wirk­sa­me Mas­sen-Ab­schie­bun­gen von der Bun­des­re­gie­rung. **In einem Schrei­ben vom 3. Fe­bru­ar an das Aus­wär­ti­ge Amt in Ber­lin, das BILD am SONN­TAG vor­liegt**, heißt es, der Ko­so­vo stehe vor einem „Mas­sen­exo­dus“. Die­ser könne „nur durch schnel­le Maß­nah­men vor allem in Deutsch­land ge­stoppt wer­den“. Al­lein aus der Haupt­stadt Pris­ti­na näh­men täg­lich „500 Per­so­nen Busse nach Ser­bi­en“, das wären min­des­tens 15 000 Per­so­nen im Monat. Ein Bot­schafts­mit­ar­bei­ter habe „am Bus­bahn­hof das Ge­ran­gel um freie Bus­plät­ze selbst be­ob­ach­tet“, heißt es in dem Schrei­ben. „Hält der Trend an, dürf­ten mo­nat­lich etwa 25 000 bis 30 000 Ko­so­va­ren das Land ver­las­sen.“ Bin­nen eines Jah­res „wären dies etwa 300 000 Per­so­nen, ein Sechs­tel der Ge­samt­be­völ­ke­rung“.

&gt;Die deut­sche Ver­tre­tung for­dert einen „Nach­weis, dass ab­ge­lehn­te Asyl­an­trag­stel­ler um­ge­hend rück­ge­führt wer­den“. Nötig sei eine „Hau­ruck­ak­ti­on des Bun­des und der Län­der“. Unter der Über­schrift „Kön­nen wir die La­wi­ne auf­hal­ten?“ schrei­ben die Diplo­ma­ten: „Erst wenn eine grö­ße­re An­zahl von Ko­so­va­ren me­di­en­wirk­sam per Sam­mel-Char­ter­flie­ger zu­rück­kehrt, deren Ver­fah­ren in­ner­halb we­ni­ger Wo­chen in Deutsch­land ab­ge­schlos­sen wur­den, spricht sich herum, dass sich il­le­ga­le Ein­wan­de­rung nach Deutsch­land nicht rech­net.“
In dem Schrei­ben heißt es, es habe „sich her­um­ge­spro­chen, dass die Ver­fah­ren in Deutsch­land in der Tat immer noch so lange dau­ern, dass sich ein Asyl­an­trag in An­be­tracht der So­zi­al­leis­tun­gen auf jeden Fall rech­net und ei­ni­ge Mo­na­te gutes Aus­kom­men sichert“. Aus der Bot­schaft wird die For­de­rung erho­ben, „die Ver­fah­ren in Deutsch­land müs­sen sicht­bar ver­kürzt wer­den“. Asyl­an­trä­ge aus dem Ko­so­vo soll­ten vor­ran­gig be­ar­bei­tet wer­den. Im Vor­jahr hät­ten sich „vor allem An­ge­hö­ri­ge der Roma, Ash­ka­li und Ko­so­vo-Ägyp­ter“ auf den Weg ge­macht. Doch nun flie­he auch die Mit­tel­schicht, was in kur­zer Zeit „gra­vie­ren­de Aus­wir­kun­gen (leere Schul­klas­sen, erste Leh­rer­ent­las­sun­gen)“ habe.

This is being investigated and debated in the European Comission... behind closed doors. Worries The concerns are mostly in regards to conflicting laws on goods. We have different laws regarding process of meat, medicine, etc. It also allows for investors to take countries to court for jeopardizing their business - and we all know how much Americans love suing... The individual countries will still have to ratify the bill, as will the Parliament; but the fact that it's so much behind closed doors and, from what it seems, would benefit mostly large corporations (not to mention the recent rise in antagonism against large corporations and a further distrust towards the US after the whole NSA ordeal) - it does not *feel* very democratic.

Another thing is this treaty: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_establishing_a_Constitution_for_Europe

It was meant create a consitution of the EU. It was against by the French and Dutch and as such, not accepted. Two years later there was this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon , which says mostly the same. In all countries (except for the Ireland, which voted in favour previously) there was *not* a national referendum - the thing which stopped the first attempt. It got denied by Ireland initially.... so they decided to do another referendum a year later. That's basically a ""we'll try as long as it takes until you guys give in"". 

If I recall correctly, the opposition centered around this line: ""Prominent changes included the move from unanimity to qualified majority voting in at least 45 policy areas in the Council of Ministers"" (quoted from the Wikipedia article, the header).

I think this point is oft-repeated but somewhat disingenuous. In the history of credit booms, rarely do they not end in tears. Germany had two such events in recent history, one in [1930](http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/weimar-europe-) and another back in [1870](http://blog.mpettis.com/2015/02/syriza-and-the-french-indemnity-of-1871-73/). Would you describe the Germans at the time as ""went on the unsustainable spending spree with very little to show for it so they are to blame for the crash""?

Infine, è stato annunciato un attacco contro Telegram in [3]: quel 2^64 che vedi è il numero di tentativi nel caso pessimo ed è piuttosto basso per gli standard di oggi.

Una cosa che da subito suona il campanello d'allarme è il loro qualificarsi come Ph.D. in matematica piuttosto che come esperti di crittografia, che è grossomodo come dire che una laurea in fisica ti consente di progettare e costruire ponti e grattacieli in virtù degli esami di meccanica razionale che dai al primo anno.

Purtroppo si tratta di questioni molto tecniche, ma se c'è bisogno posso sforzarmi in qualche modo di ELI5-arli, anche se non garantisco il risultato :)

EDIT: negli ultimi mesi è anche nata una mini-polemica sul fatto che le critiche siano riferite ad una versione vecchia delle specifiche, che pure erano quelle ufficialmente presenti sul sito di Telegram. Il che mi fa domandare dove sia la versione ""nuova"". Comunque il fatto che ora abbiamo un attacco fattibile toglie ogni dubbio sul fatto che Telegram sia bucato.

EDIT2: riguardo a WhatsApp, la crittografia end-to-end è stata implementata (per ora solo su Android) in collaborazione con il team di Moxie Marlinspike, che è un esperto di crittografia applicata al mondo reale, oltre che un pazzo :D Se non ti fidi che WhatsApp faccia davvero quello che dice, puoi provare TextSecure, che è sempre di Moxie e amici, ma completamente open source.

&gt;[The new goverment] rejects the ""troika"" team - the EU, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank (ECB) - overseeing the bailout's implementation.

And...

&gt;Under the first part, Greece would co-operate on 70% of its bailout conditions but wants to scrap 30% - replacing it with 10 new reforms to be agreed with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It is unclear what these would be.

So, not the whole program is being reconsidered, just 30% of it.

Plus, that is not even news. It was well expected that the new goverment does not want the troika, does not want to implement the program as it is and that it would get a confidence vote from the parliament.

So, instead, they presented the crisis as wholly the fault of individual countries being irresponsible. And as a result, the narrative of the debtor who is fully to blame and the creditor who is fully innocent was born.

You seem to be assuming that just because the currency union has been bad for Greece it must have been good for someone else. It hasnt.

The creditors financed the Greek spending at way too low an interest rate and lost a lot of it in the process while also having to pay for some of the fallout. That's a terrible outcome.

Their currency might be undervalued now, but that's not a good thing either. It might make for higher export, but only because they're selling their stuff too cheaply.

Where I live, there just aren't that many jobs in the city and transit is very expensive. Getting out to the suburbs to work is a hassle. We managed to find a small town to live in that lets me walk, but not to work. Half hour commute. 

Not everyone gets affordable health care. It's been improving, but if you're not working or your employer is exempt but you don't qualify for medicaid, you're pretty much screwed. My brother and sister-in-law are both employed and end up paying about 1000 a month for health coverage. 

Why are we comparing the US with the developing world instead of the rest of the developed world? 

Food banks and homeless shelters often cannot provide for everyone  - not to mention that they do not solve any problems long term. I don't know that any country has a great way of dealing with these issues, though. But don't pretend everything's just fine and dandy there. 

A lot of people don't qualify for medicaid or medicare and are overwhelmed with costs. Where do you live? Some states are better than others. 

Employers? Okay, lucky you. But that is about 1% of the companies in the US, if that. I've got a decent job. Pay is crap, but great benefits. 2 weeks vacation. Some sick pay. Free food? Free metro passes? HA! Oh, that's great. My husband works at a pretty decent company in the tech sector, but still nothing like yours. Sorry, this is not reality for most Americans. Not to mention how screwed I am if I get pregnant. 

The stereotypes are not out of date. You're out of touch with most of the country.

null,false,Naurgul,null,null,null,"&gt; You seem to be assuming that just because the currency union has been bad for Greece it must have been good for someone else. It hasnt.

Have you seen the data from their exports and company profits? Sure, the average German who got a stagnating wage didn't profit from it but the country as a whole did. 

&gt; The creditors financed the Greek spending at way too low an interest rate and lost a lot of it in the process while also having to pay for some of the fallout. That's a terrible outcome.

The cost of the bailout is minuscule so far. In fact, it would be even lower if they hadn't gone down the route of extend and pretend.

&gt; Their currency might be undervalued now, but that's not a good thing either. It might make for higher export, but only because they're selling their stuff too cheaply

That's silly. By that logic, countries would never devalue their currencies to help their exports. Care to point to any research indicating that in principle currency devaluation does not help export earnings?

&gt; That's bad because the end goal here is to make money, 

Actually, the end goal shouldn't even be to make money. The EU rules forbid countries from having too high a surplus. Why? It's simple: it creates an imbalance in the economy of other countries. Think of it this way: What does Germany do with its surplus? It gets added to its savings and then they have to invest these savings somewhere. Where do these savings get invested? Well, until recently they got ""invested"" in Greek government bonds and other Eurozone periphery bubbles.

The current government has already proposed a few different ways in which to make the Greek debt sustainable and induce growth. They have also committed analyses showing why the programme that has been enforced by Germany only leads to further weakening the Greek economy.

If we want to go into details, then yes. My point was that neither Germany nor Poland had a say in things, as the losers of the war. So it's not ""given"". When pirates split their gold, they don't ""give"" shares.

&gt; My point is, if Khruschev is currently condemned for his actions, why isn't Stalin? Poland was basically moved about 200 km to the west and could just as easily claim parts of Ukraine and Belarus that had been captured by the Soviets without any justification.

a) Political convenience. Chances of Poland taking away Kaliningrad are slim. I don't think anyone is going to argue that this matter is purely political, and not about justice or anything like that. Crimeans made their decision in the referendum, [and they seem to like it](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-02-06/one-year-later-crimeans-prefer-russia).

b) Stalin taking territory from another country to add to his is different from Kruschev giving away a piece of his country to someone else.",null,0,null,1423660743,null,0,false,0,coi309h,null,t3_2viuc0,null,t1_coi309h,null,t1_coi2ui9,null,null,null,1424529007,null,-8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-8,null

Exports have done well, but exports rising because you're too cheap/your workers are earning too little isnt a good thing. It's basically giving consumption away.

&gt; That's silly. By that logic, countries would never devalue their currencies to help their exports.

No. They devalue because their currency is overvalued. The exact opposite problem. Living standards take a hit, but it's easier than lowering prices/wages, so you get to the equilibrium quicker. Lowering living standards is bad if you dont have to. It's bad when your currency isnt overvalued.

It takes time for nations to move closer together in terms of foreign policy and strategic interests. That is the whole point of ""ever closer union"".

IMO it will happen but it takes time for unionism to be replaced by nationalism.

Thats not really true at all. There is a high level of trust between NATO countries, otherwise the whole framework would be useless.

&gt; No wonder the Americans run the world, we couldn't run a bath without first bickering about how inconsistent our temperature tastes are.

The Americans ""run the world"" because they are a cohesive and unified federation of states with a single clearly defined leader and clear strategic interests with a single foreign policy. Europe could become the same, as Winston Churchill saw it; a United States of Europe is needed. It just takes time for people to get used to the idea.

'rebels'

'separatists'

'insurgents'


[But they brag in their own videos where they come from - Russian cities - Chita, Sochi, Ulan-Ude, Naginsk, Tagil, Chelyabinsk...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkqVRc3LNZY&amp;app=desktop)

**Russian mercenaries** don't even hide their identities anymore. Good luck calling them 'rebels'

Russian mercenaries and Russian army occupy part of eastern Ukraine. 

Now they keep receiving endless ammo supplies, by cover-up Russian logistics operation, sarcastically called 'humanitarian convoys'

[Which results in indiscriminate shelling and barrage of Ukrainian positions, villages, cities, again and again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNJSsRW8LZQ)

They [fire from residential areas and high-rises of occupied Ukrainian cities of Donetsk, Gorlovka, Lugansk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2uac3O-ZqU)

Using civilians and residential areas as a shield against Ukrainian artillery. [*Shielding themselves with innocents*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wHHC5DX_QI)

It's full-blown war out there, with invading Russians using artillery, tanks, mercs and regular army troops to capture more of Ukrainian land. And wreak havoc. [Meanwhile, boasting about shelling civilians](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC2lwRt4rh4&amp;t=0m52s)

2000 Ukrainian soldiers KIA and 5000 civilians (the least estimate) after 6 months of WAR.

Russians who wage war against Ukraine are actively recruited in their home country, transported, given weapons and equipment and supported by incredibly sophisticated logistics effort by Russian army.
Apart from these mercs and 'volunteers', there are regular Russian army battalions in the occupied areas, also engaging in combat, as well as operating sophisticated Russian [anti-air](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HT_UrR7VmY) and artillery systems.

You may call it whatever you like, but basically it's Russia waging all-out war on Ukraine.

When someone tells you that there are no Russian troops in Ukraine - spit in their face.

[Today 16 people died. More will die tomorrow and in coming months, there is no end in sight.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc9Kh-OL4sQ)

[This is what people in eastern Ukraine see, every single day. Thanks to Russian 'liberators'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN4dAHzBHD8)

And tons of Russian state propaganda keep pouring from Ruptly/Russia Today/any other Russian channel - claiming that Russia 'is not involved', shoveling this bullshit everywhere... incessantly promoting the [deceptive notion that those Russian mercenaries are 'local rebels'](https://twitter.com/666_mancer/status/565261015399792640)

Oh, and there is way, way more. Russian state media 'reporters' somehow instantaneously arrive at the areas where Russian artillery has struck... They immediately capture images of the dead and dying, carefully taking their shots and giving commentary about 'Ukrainian artillery shelling civilians', focused on their precious footage, disregarding dying and bleeding ones. Satisfied, they drive off.

This has happened so many times, that locals already know that *Russian TV reporter loitering at a certain area is an obvious sign of impending artillery strike.*

Russians keep shelling even the cities they occupy and stay in just to get the goddamn footage they need so badly, to perpetuate the hatred in their [propaganda war.](http://en.censor.net.ua/news/321044/the_trolleybus_in_donetsk_was_shelled_from_residential_areas_controlled_by_terrorists_defense_ministry)

Not to mention the horrendous reports of Russian TV where 'local rebels' [humiliate, torture and mutilate Ukrainian POWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrfUJ82S8ec). Again, such propaganda videos are carefully staged, civilians misinformed about who was behind the attacks or 'accidents' and aggressively agitated by finger-pointing - all for the sake of getting proper **footage**. 

Russians have perfected the art of contorting reality. 

They picture what *they* want you to see, bolstering bigotry and anger, intricately promoting partial truth and bringing up partial facts for their own benefit, distorting the facts; they bribe officials in other countries, trying to influence public opinions there, and whatnot. 

And in these murky waters they murder Ukrainians en masse, claiming this slaughter to be 'liberation' or 'war waged by rebels'.

Simply put, Russian invaders bring [death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kElUzTCy1s).

**UPD:** 

I had and still have some mess to clean up, moving around the city a bit and getting it all together.

Right, you shouldn't question my views, they have been pro-Ukrainian for a while, and becoming fervently pro-Ukrainian as all of this crap that Russians bring here and do to us keeps going on and on.

As usual, tons of Putin-bots and some mislead (?) folk assaulting my comments, pushing 'evidence' and their 'point view'. Claiming, /u/walt_ua to be a liar, etc.

**So, I've considered to do an AMA, to set things straight about me and what's going on which I will probably start tomorrow afternoon by local time.**

A big Thank You to everyone supporting me, much appreciated.

**UPD2:** seems like I need to schedule it - haven't done it before - with moderators, evidence and everything. Gonna update these post(s) when time is set when it's happening.

null,false,astute_stoat,null,null,null,"Il a menacé la France d'attentats comme beaucoup de gens mais avait-il les moyens de mettre sa menace à exécution ? Si oui, son assassinat a-t-il réduit les moyens de son groupe ou de son organisation ? Si cette méthode fonctionne, pourquoi avons-nous de plus en plus d'attentats au Moyen-Orient, au Proche-Orient et en Europe ? 

Cette stratégie d'exécutions ciblées découle naturellement de la doctrine militaire américaine qui se base sur la destruction des moyens de communication, commandement, coordination et renseignement de l'ennemi: dans une guerre conventionnelle c'est un excellent moyen d'empêcher l'armée ennemie de monter des opérations car même si son potentiel en hommes et en armes reste intact, elle est rendue incapable de les mobiliser efficacement. Mais ici on essaie pas de gagner une guerre, on gère au jour le jour un problème politique. Il n'y a pas de stratégie de long terme pour gagner ce conflit à part réagir aux innovations déployées par l'adversaire et tuer les chefs partout où c'est possible. La seule chose que ces services de renseignements armés en escadrons de la mort ont à nous offrir c'est une gestion au jour le jour, un véritable travail de police à coups de bombes. Sont-ils capables de dire où on sera dans 5, 10, 20 ans ? On aura gagné ? Ca va faire 15 ans qu'on fait la même chose sans aucun résultat probant: dans une véritable guerre, quel général conserverait ses galons avec des résultats pareils ?

J'ajoute que c'est faire preuve d'arrogance que d'imaginer que l'ennemi va plier les gaules parce qu'on tue son chef: les français ou les américains plieraient-ils si des terroristes tuaient leur président ou leurs chefs d'état-major ? Certes non, bien au contraire. Les israéliens les premiers ont réalisé dans les années 70 que l'assassinat ciblé de chefs terroristes permettait de fragiliser la structure pendant quelques années mais ne servait à long terme qu'à accélérer l'ascension de leaders encore plus radicaux. Maintenant les américains ont exécuté tout ce que la Mésopotamie comptait d'hommes forts et de chefs de guerre, et le résultat par séléction naturelle c'est l'arrivée au pouvoir des coupeurs de tête de Daesh. Beau résultat.

Je ne suis pas BHL, je n'ai pas l'intention d'aller m'improviser messager de la paix au Yémen, mais je regarde l'histoire récente et je me dis que si on avait appliqué cette méthode moderne de gestion des conflits à coups de missile à l'époque, on aurait dessoudé sans y penser à deux fois des gens comme Mandela ou Arafat qui étaient à une certaine époque considérés par les occidentaux et les israéliens comme des terroristes. Sans un leader charismatique comme Mandela capable de garder ses troupes sous contrôle, y-aurait-il eu une solution négociée à la fin de l'Apartheid ? Si les israéliens avaient réussi à plomber Arafat, qui d'autre aurait eu la légitimité nécessaire pour amener les factions palestiniennes à la table des négociations ?

At the beginning of 90s we had a perfect storm...

* In the 80s we had greatly expanded our welfare state and tightened labor legislation. This increased our fixed costs greatly and made our economy less dynamic. In the same time due to overheating of the economy, wages just went up continuously making our industries less competent.
* During the second half of 80s, we liberalized our financial markets which went full mental thanks to huge expansion of finance opportunities, but also due to great incompetence. The conservative bank managers didn't know how to act in the new economy and thus loaned money to anybody who was confident enough and seemed like market wiz-kid.
* During the end of 80s our companies expanded their activities with great pace, buying companies here and there, making investment here and there, and taking ever more ambitious customer projects. For example Nokia greatly overextended during this time to become a general European electronic conglomerate, unfortunately they leveraged themselves greatly and made bad decisions, the CEO Kari Kairamo was manic-depressive, and when he saw the troubles in 1988, he made a suicide. When the depression started and Jorma Ollila took over the company, they actually calculated that they couldn't close loss making TV-factory Bochum, it would have bankrupted the firm. Another suicide was of Matti Ali-Melkkilä, Chairman of Saving Bank Central bank, who did it in 1989 when he saw the writing in the wall. Later the whole banking group went bust in 1991. Another big failure was Wärtsilä Yards which went bankrupt in 1989 very suddenly, they had failed miserably in their operating accounting and ran out of money, the case was still used as an example in university of what happens when you fail on your cost accounting.
* 1989-1991 Soviet Union collapsed which cut our major export market in one night.
* 1990s beginning there was a general recession around Europe and in our major export markets in Nordics.

Any of the points mentioned would have caused a small recession by themselves, however we have perfect storm that totally overwhelmed the Finnish economies and society. We didn't end up asking a loan from IMF and Worldbank because our politicians made it clear that if we take that line, the cuts will be even more severe, thus severe austerity was enacted by ourself. The depression that started in 90/91 still effected our economy for the whole 90s, it was only when Nokia and Internet industries emerged that we rebounded.",null,0,null,1423661780,null,0,false,0,coi3d33,null,t3_2vis7o,null,t1_coi3d33,null,t1_coi2txi,null,null,null,1424529173,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

I ws actually travilling across the US and it was surprising how difficult the flour thing was, it was meant to be an example, but it is shocking, that in an average store you would find it only with added baking powder. I was not referring to additives such as pesticides etc.

So you would say that kant nietzsche etc are useless, 
Marx kind of dominated the last century, Luther was quite an important person don't you think?
german music is generall quite important just think about bach bruckner wagner hindemith schönberg etc. 
it is not about how to measure the impact of cultures on others, i do not wish to say that german culture is superior.
Still you are blatantly stupid saying that german culture is basically irrelevant.
Modern culture is not really a proper unit to measure cultural impact, it comes and goes, culture is more than what you see on tv. I give you that german tv stations are ridiculous, but have you ever considered, that reading books might also be culturally important, there is quite a lot going on there.

But it is exactly beer waiting to ferment. Do you think the EU just sprang into existence with all 28 member states at the exact same time coming to an agreement on every single issue and all members making the necessary economic and political reforms instantly? Its been a long and steady journey to where we are today, and it will take longer before we get a full United States of Europe. I don't like it, and clearly you don't either. But that is the way it has been and it will continue to be.

&gt; And NATO is clearly done by America's will and diplomacy, proven by how poorly our own European based military organisations have managed to do leaving us with a hodge-podge of half-implemented acronyms.

""Our own European based military"" has done poorly because of the simple fact that NATO exists. NATO was originally intended to be a purely European defensive alliance, but the American congress decided not to leave after its creation (which is subsequently why De Gaulle made France leave for a while).

IF NATO didn't exist then we would have need of a European defense alliance, but as it stands NATO does exist and therefore a European defense framework is not needed in addition to NATO.

&gt; We do not trust each other, we trust America.

But this is still unsubstantiated. Britian and France trust each other to such an extent that we have a myriad of military co-operation agreements and shared hardware agreements.

Here is my problem with this: 
Isn't this nothing more but an endless circle then?

Back in 2010 there were pretty much 2 possibilities:
1. Greece defaults
2. Greece gets a loan

Back then people opted for option 2, and now all we hear is that that loan was stupid and that the creditors were stupid to do it in the first place. 

But aren't we right now in the exact same situation?
Either greece gets money or they default.

So when people say in 2010 it was a mistake to loan money to greece wouldn't the logical thing to do now be to let greece default?
Because when people say that the loans from 2010 never should have been issued, that they were bad credit and that germany should be ashamed of itself they say that greece should have defaultet in 2010.
How is it possible that the people who say that the creditors were assholes in 2010 and never should have given money to greece now say that greece needs more money?

That being said, the homeless are not a sign of ""scrapped"" social democracy, but rather a sign of how incomplete the system is.

Under the old social contract from a few decades ago this was less of a problem, but the change in the structure of society has made the gaps - that have always been there - more visible.

---

&gt;The __Italian fiscal code card__, officially known as Italy's [Codice Fiscale](https://en.wikipedia.org//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codice_Fiscale), is the tax code card in Italy, similar to a [Social Security Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Number) (SSN) card in the United States or the [National Insurance Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Insurance_Number) issued in the United Kingdom. The tax code in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) is an alphanumeric code of 16 characters. The card serves to identify unambiguously individuals residing in Italy irrespective of residency status. Designed by and for the Italian tax office, it is now used for several other purposes, e.g. uniquely identifying individuals in the health system, or [natural persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_persons) who act as parties in private [contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract).

Pour mes études j'ai du étudier et visiter les cités Marseillaises mais aussi celle de la ville de Naples. Même dans les quartiers chauds (et ils sont très chauds) de ces villes les roms se font rejeter voir agresser par les gens du coin car considérés comme source de trop de délinquance...
En cours d'urbanisme on a aussi parlé du fait que plusieurs fois en Europe on a essayé de leur construire des logements pour s'installer et à chaque fois la grosse majorité finit par partir en laissant tout ravagé derrière.

Je passe pour un gros raciste depuis tout à l'heure, mais je ne pense absolument pas que les roms soient différents de toi et moi, et beaucoup se sédentarisent ou même restent dans les camps et ne sombrent pas dans la délinquance, scolarisent leurs enfants et méritent d'être mieux traités, mais une bonne partie, de part à la fois le rejet dont ils font preuve depuis des siècles mais aussi à une culture de mafia et de délinquance présente dans leur communauté, se retrouvent à se refermer sur eux-mêmes et à mendier et voler et s'attirent la haine de tout le monde, et là c'est le cercle vicieux.

La storia è semplice: lo studio dove lavoro ha diversi clienti nell'industria aeronautica, e uno di questi ogni tanto lavora per Alenia, che ogni tanto lavora per l'ESA, quindi concatenando ogni tanto^3 lavoro per l'ESA. Nella fattispecie questo progetto era il sistema di attivazione di un beacon radio, in pratica un controllore di processo che attiva dei relay passato un certo tempo dal lancio e in presenza di determinate condizioni. Io mi sono occupato [della shell](http://i.imgur.com/CeeMZf0.png), ovvero dell'involucro in alluminio che contiene le schede elettroniche, quindi dal punto di vista funzionale non saprei dirti molto. Quello che so è che è stato un bagno di sangue far digerire all'ESA l'utilizzo di relay in quella zona del velivolo a causa dello shock dovuto alla separazione degli stadi, avevano paura di falsi contatti e ho dovuto produrre tonnellate di [analisi](http://i.imgur.com/wj7O71I.png), di test e di carta per fargli digerire dei cazzo di smorzatori di gomma che risolvevano la cosa. Da allora cerchiamo di evitare lo spazio, troppi spipponamenti (per quanti giustificati, per carità) per i nostri gusti.

Per quanto riguarda lavorare con l'ESA per la mia scarsa esperienza non posso dire niente di negativo. Persone preparate e ambiente veramente europeo, nel senso che lavori fianco a fianco con gente di ogni nazionalità che ti fa sentire, lingua a parte, veramente membro di un'unione di stati.

(a) if you believe that development in Greece (IT, research, tourism, agriculture) will always be a bubble because of our culture then you need to explain how Greek expats do these things efficiently in other countries AND what else can we do (just die is not a valid answer) 

(b) the relationship between Germany and Greece right now is one of friends in paper but in reality it is one of colony and master. Since the goodwill of the master is needed for an elected government to function I say that national sovereignty is done. Essentially Germany has been giving more and more ridiculously bad loans and then saying 'do what I say it else'. We can't stand it any more. Also remember that all the loans go back to pay loans, the people see nothing of them

&gt;According to the new Greek government analysis (backed by several prominent economists worldwide), the Greek economy is being lead to destruction unless agreements made with previous governments change.

Even if we accept that this is an accurate assessment, it doesn't mean that they have a solid plan to actually make this happen.

&gt;The current government is asking from EU,IMF,ECB to sit down and talk about this, since that is the will of the people in Greece.

Few points here.  First, if you listen to the statements coming out of the Greek leaders, it is pretty clear that it isn't just talk, it is talk *with preconditions*.  

Those are vastly different things.  For instance, there is a difference between Merkel saying ""let's talk"" and Merkal say ""let's talk but there will be no discussion of any reduction in austerity"".

Next, while the Greek leaders have an obligation to listen to the will of the people of Greece, what does that have to do with everyone else?  I mean, if the German voters elected leaders that promised to triple interest on Greek loans and to seize personal bank accounts and property for non-payment, should Greece be under any obligation to sit down to discuss it?  I'd say not.

&gt;But Germany acts unilaterally, refusing to start such negotiations, basically saying that elections or not, we're expecting you to do as you're told.

What are you talking about?  Varoufakis himself said:

&gt;We respect institutions but we don’t plan to cooperate with that committee.

in reference to the troika just 2 weeks ago.  He then went on a tour of Euro capitals appealing to leaders directly.  Only after it became clear that it wouldn't work did Varoufakis sit down with the head of the ECB.

Trying to spin this as the *Germans* making unilateral moves is silly.  Also, you realize that Varoufakis did meet with Wolfgang Schauble last week.  It was pretty well publicized.

Second, when you say ""we're expecting you to do as you're told"", I think what you actually mean is ""we're expecting you to do *as you promised to when we gave you the hundreds of billions that you wanted*"".

Those aren't really the same thing.

Also, whose elections are you referring to?  Are the Greek elections the only ones that count?  I'm pretty sure the last German elections didn't deliver some mandate to restructure the greek loans significantly.

&gt;The current government has already proposed a few different ways in which to make the Greek debt sustainable and induce growth.

Sure, but which one do you consider ""solid""?

I mean a forgiveness of 50% of the loans certainly makes the debt more sustainable and will help Greek growth, but there is little chance of it happening, so it seems silly to think it is a ""solid"" plan.

&gt;They have also committed analyses showing why the programme that has been enforced by Germany only leads to further weakening the Greek economy.

You mean the one the Greeks agreed to as a condition of getting hundred of billions in loans to prop up their country?

&gt;Now it's Germany's side to stop acting like a child and at least explain why they insist on this particular programme and/or why they disagree exactly with the Greek proposals.

You've got it backwards.  The lender is under no obligation to explain why they don't want to eliminate debt or change the terms of a loan just because the borrow isn't happy with it anymore.

I mean, if you don't like the loan on your house or your car, you don't walk into the bank, go out of your way to agitate the bankers, and then demand that they justify why they won't just forgive massive amounts of the loan you took out, do you?

If you do, I'm not sure how you walk out thinking that *they* are the ones acting like children.",null,0,null,1423664444,null,0,false,0,coi4etq,null,t3_2vis7o,null,t1_coi4etq,null,t1_coi2x8x,null,null,null,1424529662,null,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14,null

Do you remember the Flash Crash of 2010?  The dow dropped 1000 points in 5 minutes.  And that was caused by the Greeks passing austerity, and rioters approaching the Parliament.  I was home sick that day, and watched the whole thing in horror on Bloomberg, I almost puked.

What people fail to understand how much of trading is done by robots.  These robots scan global financial media for keywords and make trades based on an algorithm.  Now people do select the keywords and context of course.  ""Greek Austerity vote""  ""greek riots"" ""greek default,"" things like that will spur automatic selling.  

While automated selling it a terrible thing, I'd be making the same call myself.  In fact, I have kept an eye on this whole thing since 2009.  If it is really looking bad, I'll sell my S&amp;P 500 ETF and wait.  If they are bailed out, it will go up a decent bit and I'll try to get in before missing too much of the gains.  If they are left out in the wind, I will buy into the crash.

This whole thing isn't about Greece, it's about faith in the Euro and in the entire European project.  You have Germany pursuing a policy not much different than was imposed on itself after WWI.  We can debate if Germany brought that on itself all day, but it doesn't matter, because the results would be the same.  If you punish and humiliate people, there will be a backlash and extremism.  There is now extremism in Greece.

And then you have the Greeks asking for Nazi compensation money, just wow.  You have pictures of current Germans dressed up like Nazis in the papers.  There is real hostility.

From over here, it doesn't look like a lot of people have not learned from history.  

I could go on and on, but if you ask me, it could be disastrous if Greece is allowed to collapse, but the UK and the US might not let that happen.  Just think, it will probably start a domino effect on Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy.  Greece could end up in the Russian orbit.

It will be a shit show that either breaks the EZ and possibly EU into a more rational Northern European group, or just a massive cluster fuck of anarchy.

But I have some bad experiences, like some drunk stupid guys heard me talking with my friend in Hungarian and they told us that we shouldn't speak Hungarian here because this is Romania and we should fuck off to Hungary, and they almost beat us. But the main problem is that the politicians have no interest is tryint to stop the hate and rivalry between the ethnicities, they are trying to ignite the fire and spread hate so they get more voters when they spew some xenophobic bullshit in their campaign. 
And I don't know what foreig politics has to do with this, but I don't think Hungary is very pro-Russian, they are more balanced and in my opinion that's a good thing. Every country should decide what's better for them instead of following the bullshit of the US everytime. I personally think that the sanctions against Russia are stupid and the only party benefiting from it is the US, but they can make the EU do whatever they want them to do, and I don't like that, so I actually like Hungary's foreign policy and the fact that they make decisions and they criticize the EU/US, and not just blindly following them. I'm more afraid of the US than Russia personally, I think Russia is not a threat to the EU because they would never attack us, and the Ukrainian crisis is partly the fault of the US because they ignited the revolution against Yanukovich and they put the current fascist government in power, and I think it was expected that Putin will get outraged if the US makes Ukraine their puppet state. ( because that's what they are trying to do with every European country. ) I'm not saying that Russia is good, but I don't find being a pro-US and an anti-Russian a necessarily good thing.

Ce genre de diagnostique je vais de façon très hypocrite te dire que c'est peu valable quand tu le fais toi même (je suis le premier à me dire cela cependant...).

Tu as quoi du coup ? 19/20 ans ? tu as le temps encore (même si je vais pas te mentir ça passe vite) de rebondir, tu veux être auxiliaire de vie scolaire ? fais ça le temps de retomber sur tes pattes c'est un métier utile, même si c'est pas toujours reconnu.

Tu vas me dire pour retomber sur mes pattes il aurait fallut que j'ai déjà été sur elle....

Et je pense la même chose de moi, j'ai l'impression d'être un échec cuisant; d'avoir raté tout et de navoir réussi ce que j'ai réussi que par tricherie ou défaillance du système. Pleins de gens ont cru en moi et j'ai peu ou prou toujours déçu leurs attentes....

Mais, ça c'est l'image que j'ai de moi, d'autres au contraire me prenne pour quelqu'un de brillant quand ils voient mon parcours, ou quand ils l'ont connu de près...donc j'ai ça qui m'aide à relativiser.

Manifestement ton entourage ne joue pas se rôle là, mais après tout tu peu très bien faire quelquechose de ta vie sans suivre des études, tu es peut être plus manuel que mental. Alors continue à chercher, soit curieux, expérimente autant que tu peux et tu finira peut être par trouver quelque chose qui te plais, ou juste quelque chose de supportable qui te permette de vivre. 

Mais surtout ne te bloque pas sur ce que tu aurais selon toi. 

T'es peut être pas Einstein, ou quelqu'un de très intelligent (très subjectif cela dit) ça ne fait pas de toi quelqu'un de raté ou d'inutile par ailleurs. 

Fais avec ce que tu as, si ça ne satisfait pas essaye de faire mieux, mais dans tous les cas n'hésite pas en attendant qu'on te disent que tu as ci ou ça. Parce que ton problème il est pas tant psy ou intellectuelle que de confiance en toi :)

If you were the OP can you not just post a piece of paper with your username on the pictured missile. 

And guys please don't downvote me for not reacting rationally and asking for a small bit of proof from /u/walt_ua.

I've read his post and it's very interesting stuff but the skeptic in me thinks someone who put that much effort into a post would at least confirm their reddit identity in some way.

If I was to point to my reasoning as to why I'm 50/50 on believing this it's only because.

* Upvote inducing title to and joke to win the /r/pics r/wtf redditors short attention spam.

*  [some redditors have been already been called out for using /r/ukraina as a place to organize vote braiding and other activities in plain sight under cover of ukranian language](http://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/2u9s15/rukraina_may_be_brigading_this_sub/)

* OP is a mod of many Ukrainian subs, so what one may call a prolific redditor who knows how it can be used so  why he didn't do the first thing I would and take a selfie with that missile which would make it /r/all material
(also, what is a guy who lives in Kramatorsk doing moderating /r/Lviv which is about 1000KM away and displaying ""Lviv "" flair ?

then

* highly up-voted comments used to (sell the product) or in this case hijack readers attention to the more political side of the conflict and spread the real message which is /u/walt_ua personal viewpoint on the conflict (no surprise it's very anti Russian and very pro UA).

I'm totally interested in the story but the way it's presented appears like internet marketing 101 or maybe /r/karmaconspiracy material but either way I want to find out because understanding propaganda and how it's utilized is one of my nerdy hobbies and to me this is textbook propaganda tactics for the 21st century.

**EDIT:** Ok it's semi official, I just caught the OP  posting on /r/ukrania  ""Spreading the word""/asking for upvotes

**Edit 2:** Looks to me like /r/ukrania really is a place where the demographic of the different subreddits are discussed and they [organize/discuss what to post/where and how to get an audience.](http://i.imgur.com/2njLcsY.png )

Ok I'm all ready to be called a Russian shill/Conspiracy nut and my ass is puckered but I've been downvoted here many times for suggesting that there is also a pro Ukrainian ""PoreschenkoBot"" army using it to gather attention, I won't name names but you will see the same posters submitting anti-Rusisan articles day in and day out,

Of course there is Russians/Israelis/Brits/Chinese/Americans doing the same but what I dislike is the hypocrisy that comes from only blaming one side and dismissing their real arguements which are often deemed invalid because of this stigma of ""the putinbots"" but anyway /u/walt_ua care to address my concerns before I go more public with them as I do like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt before making accusations to admins and mods about what appears to be a violation of Reddit TOS

**Edit 3:**  Wow this really blew up, not heard anything convincing from the OP as reagrds proof (even though they spent the say in the city and ""cleaning up"" another kind redditor /u/laspero tipped me off this image is not original in any way, shape or form, Google search by image doesn't let you sort by ""oldest"" but after digging through all the tweets and retweats the earliest Instance I can find for this image come from none other than...wait for it   [""Euromaidan PR""](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPR/status/565130107401281536) 

I sent the account owners a message to ask where they sourced it but will have to wait and see if I get an answer on that. 

To the OP, I want to believe you but I'm calling shenanigans on this now, If it was me and I was genuinely being taken on by some internet know it all, I'd have taken at least taken a follow up picture from outside my apartment where it's safe by now but my offer still stands...show me the simple proof I asked for and I will literally eat my hat and post a video reply proving it (with my username visible) if it turns out you are telling the truth here. 

also on a side-note to those telling me ""so what if it's propaganda, this did happen to someone"" I'm sorry but I don't want to hear the new sexed up improved version of the rocket that his *somebodys* balcony (who just happens to be a reddit mod with great english in a country where only a few percent speak it) told as a local human interest story from a PR expert with a masters in telling beading heart stories of tragedy to a western audience willing to lap it up.

If you are ok with that sort of propaganda then we don't share the common value of respecting integrity above all else, I thought the idea of living in the west is that while we are maybe not above twisting the truth (yet) but we are above flat out lying (or so I thought).",null,0,null,1423664982,null,0,1423701986,1,coi4nap,null,t3_2vj090,null,t1_coi4nap,null,t1_coi3ask,null,null,null,1424529772,null,420,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,420,null

So we can cut the budget and spend it in the UK, maintain our roads better, extra money to the NHS, can probably take a shot at wiping out the need for food banks while were at it.

We can still sit on the UNSC, its a joke of institution anyway when one country can veto anything they don't like. Anyone tries to put forward a motion to remove us as a permanent member we can veto that. So its pretty much a guaranteed situation of us keeping our spot no matter what.

Foreign aid imo is more likely to help us influence a country by educating their children, paying for hospitals etc than putting a couple hundred soldiers in their country. With a smaller budget we would still be able to send trainers.

Look how Britain and France handled the invasion of Poland -- we declared war but didn't immediately invade because we weren't ready and we weren't willing to take the brunt of the losses. Same deal with America and NATO. They won't throw their men into the main fight until Europe bleeds Russia out first; to expect them to take the brunt of Russian military power for us is absurd.

America still has a very strong isolationist undercurrent where people feel that Europe should fights ""its own wars"" and America should leave them alone. This pervades both the populist left and right.

any shop with little room between door and register/counter (think flower shop, bakery, Tante Emma Laden) warrants a generic greeting. Always greet when the store clerk makes brief eye contact with you immediately upon entering (usually a sign that they are used to people offering greetings upon entering.

That happens a lot more often in smaller towns (10.000 people and below), but also in formerly independen boroughs that got incorporated into larger cities within the last say 60 years or so. Iam, for example, a native of Hamburg and there are districts here that still very much self-identify and feel like the villages they were before the Nazis incorporated them into Gross-Hamburg. I have personally experienced that in Sülldorf and Blankenese west of the Alster and Marienthal and Volksdorf on the east. It won't happen in the inner city, central Wandsbek or Altona.

I've found the general greeting in small shops to be extremely prevalent in Munich and Nuremberg (where I have visited multiple times respectively), but totally absent everywhere I've been in Berlin during my 6 month internship, no matter how small the shop in question.

For the rest of the coutry I can't speak with any authority. Where do you say does it never happen?


Seltzer was the term used by both, my host family about 50 miles southwest of Washington DC in the very early 2000s (upper middle class Virginia natives in their then mid 60s) and a former boss of mine now in his 30s, originally from the Northeast but with significant time spent in California.

His usage of the term struck me as a little odd because I always equated the use of Seltzer with older people (my host-parents' age), but he wagered that he porbaby picked up that term during his time in the military - which might incidentally be where my host dad (Vietnam vet) picked it up as well.

Over the years, I have heard exchange students and US citizens from other parts of the country refer to sparkling water simply as ""soda"" or ""soda water"" - but those were always people who called soft-drinks ""pop"" instead of ""soda"", which is the term I learned myself and also associate with people from the East Coast and California.

As far as Germany is concerned, ""Selters"" and ""Selter"" is used interchangably in Northern Germany, with a strong emphasis on the latter in Hamburg. In my experience, ""Selter"" (tiny hiss on the s, and slightly more d than t) and ""Pferd"" (pronounced ""Ferd"") are a surefire tell to identify people from Hamburg who otherwise speak High German without accent.

Apart from that, most people I know across the country as well as I myself generally only use the term ""Wasser"" when ordering water, which tends to get me sparkling water throughout Germany, unless I specifically stress that I don't want the carbonated stuff.
