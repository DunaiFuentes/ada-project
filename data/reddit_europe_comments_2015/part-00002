This aligns with my personal experience of interacting with   illegal immigrants, few of them expressed the wish to stay. The only reason why Greece, Spain and Italy have a higher percentage of immigrants, is because of their geographical location.

Have you ever thought that this might be part of why you're so unhappy here?  For the average Joe, it's not usual to have family members own multiple properties.  It's not usual to have a down payment for some lower-end homes in California at that age; it's not normal to own part of a house at that age, either.  (Good for you, though!  It's great that you have your finances sorted out so well!)  That alone implies that your family is well-connected and well-rooted in your community in California.  It also implies that your family has a financial buffer in case of emergency.  For the overwhelming majority of Americans, that's not the case.  

That's why you're getting a lot of comments from other Americans about how Germany is awesome, because if you're middle class, Germany is awesome and there's a sense of equality that isn't present in the middle class in the US.

Reread the articles on both incidents. The first ship was moldovan, but both were mostly full of syrian refugees.

No, which is why we should arrest those who actually took control of those ships (the pirates; the armed smugglers). Not the civilians.

Anyone who imply we should just abandon people to their death on that boat because they don't have legal immigration paper. Or who suggest sending them back immediately to syria/whatever dangerous area they came from.

Single rooms are way more expensive everywhere if you calculate per square foot. Also depends a lot on where you are. Where I live you get a thousand square feet for 900 Euros.

Not only are many of us hugely wealthy compared to the poorest Africans, the inequality stretches well beyond that - we have far superior education, healthcare, opportunities, infrastructure, safety, standards, right, equality, etc, etc

Wealth is relative, I'd rather be on the poverty line in Norway than in the top 1% in Somalia. And if I was in the top 1% in Somalia I would leave long before I had to pay some 75% tax.

When you permit in poor, uneducated immigrants, you're always going to be reducing your average quality-of-life.  The United States is far poorer and less literate on average due to Mexican immigration.

But are you concerned about *average* numbers, or how any individual is impacted?  Let's say that someone from Syria is interested in living and working in Sweden because he makes more money than he would in Syria.  Let's also say that he'd be willing to do so even without welfare incentives (which might be wrong, but I don't think that this is a difficult guess; surely a large chunk of Africa's population would flood into Sweden, given the opportunity to do so, even if there were no welfare benefits provided).

So someone immigrates and they make more money and a chance at their children having a better life.  They win.  Existing Swedes aren't artificially-restricted from having access to low-skill labor.  They win: it's cheaper to have someone, say, serving food.

If your concern is that there are some existing Swedes who are well-educated and skilled and so forth but just want to sit on welfare, and you don't want their lot to be worse-off, and you're dead set on this model, then why not create a two-tiered system where welfare is tied to Swedish birth rather than citizenship?  Then you've a set of ""first-class"" citizens who get access to welfare benefits and ""second-class"" citizens who don't *but* who are enjoying an economically-better life than they otherwise would and whose children will become first-class citizens?  That's effectively what illegal immigration does in the United States.

&gt;expensive house morgages

That's [going to happen anyway](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21614165-house-prices-europe-are-losing-touch-reality-again-deflating-bubbles):

&gt; Swedish house prices have more than trebled since 1996 and household debt has reached 174% of after-tax income.

...and in fact, to the extent that immigrants drive up house values and new construction doesn't keep up with new demand, there's a wealth transfer from immigrants to existing residents, which I'd expect to be in your interest if your concern is for existing residents:

&gt; Stockholm is Europe’s fastest growing capital—its population is expected to expand by 50% by 2030—yet cranes are scarce. The 30,000 new arrivals each year have increased competition for housing, and record-low interest rates have allowed Stockholmers to afford bigger mortgages.

null,false,TheEndgame,NORW,Norway,null,"&gt; The wealth gap determines the excessive influence over policymaking which the wealthy elite enjoys, and abuses to tilt the tables even further

Of course wealth plays a role when it comes to influence. It's a matter of leverage, and while a rich person have lots of assets in a country like factories, stocks and real estate a regular person doesn't. So then you can ask yourself who the state care most about keeping. You may think that it's unfair, but that's how stuff works.

&gt; As Thomas Piketty showed, there is always a movement towards greater equality or towards greater inequality, and a large wealth gap ensures that the trend toward greater inequality continues unbroken and at an accelerating pace.

And there is a reason why this is the case. Rich people usually have their assets tied to the stock, bond and real estate market. These are markets that have a high rate of return in most places. The regular person usually have their assets in their bank account and homes. While their homes usually goes up in value, their bank accounts don't, especially in the later years when interest rates have been low. 

The stock market has rallied ever since the financial crisis, which is a side effect of low interest rates. So while the average Joe doesn't want to invest in the ""scary"" stock market and has kept his money in a low interest bank account, the rich people have enjoyed a high rate of return. 

After the war these things were different. While the rich still played around with stocks, the regular Joe had his money in bank accounts that gave a very good return since interest rates were high. Not to mention a growing economy and rising house prices. 

Of course the stagnating income growth in some countries are to blame to a certain degree, but i would blame low interest rates above all. I would like you to comment on my suggestion of higher capital gains taxes.

How can anyone 'move on' when they're showing a blatant disregard for people's feeling's on the matter, it's another case of 'let's all have a laugh at the paddy's'.

What does that have to do with anything? So what I support United, I never said I hated everything inherently British, what's your point?. I hate people like you and the cunt who's writing the 'comedy' who try to speak for all Irish people for example in your first comment "" I don't think this will bother most people"" and the wanker that's writing it ""I don’t want to do anything that denies the suffering that people went through, but Ireland has always been good at black humor"".

null,false,Ripolin,ZBSVUE,U-E,null,"&gt; Je pense que l'origine du probleme est la religion, qui crée et isole les communautés. 

Corrélation n'est pas causalité. L'isolation de ces communautés n'est le fait seulement de la religion, d'autres facteurs peuvent entrer en jeu: l'accès aux transports, l'accès à l'emploi, l'accès aux services publics, l'accès à l'éducation, etc. Lorsque des individus sont privés de plusieurs de ces instances qui permettent de relier chacun à l'ensemble plus vaste que représente la société, l'intégration est remplacée par l'exclusion. La religion peut alors sembler comme un moyen de s'intégrer dans une communauté, où les trajectoires individuelles se rejoignent. Les mosquées sont des lieux de socialisation importants, où l'on vient certes prier, mais également discuter et se rencontrer.

&gt; Le Coran explique clairement qu'il ne faut pas se meler aux mécréants. Comme base pour l'intégration tu avoueras que ca n'est pas gagné.

L'interprétation qu'on donne au Coran évolue au gré des périodes. La dynastie almoravide en Espagne/Maroc était réputée pour sa tolérance, notamment à l'égard des Juifs, tandis que l'Empire Ottoman, malgré ses travers, a permis le développement des christianismes avec le système protecteur des Millets. Il y avait certes distinction entre les communautés, mais elle n'était pas synonyme de distance ni d'exclusion. 

&gt; Encore une fois, niveau immigration ça complique.

Attention aux amalgames. Les immigrés ne sont pas nécessairement vecteurs d'islamisation ou de refus de l'intégration. Ce point rejoint le précédent. C'est d'autant plus vrai qu'historiquement, les immigrés sont souvent été considérés comme des personnes refusant plus ou moins l'intégration, comme les polonais, les italiens ou les espagnols, qui préféraient logiquement se regrouper pour vivre ensemble comme une diaspora plus ou moins organisée. Lorsque la religion entre en jeu, les choses peuvent être plus délicates, mais globalement, je pense que le problème est le même, celui d'une société qui exclut indirectement des populations, qui peuvent ensuite choisir de s'exclure de celle-ci en adoptant des comportements opposés aux normes communes.

&gt; Nier ces evidences n'est simplement pas une bonne idée.

Les religions sont en déclin en Europe, mais elles existent encore, et bien plus qu'on ne le croit. En Pologne ou dans les États orthodoxes des Balkans, ainsi qu'en Grèce, la prégnance de la religion peut paraître surprenante pour un Français habitué aux traditions laïques. Une visite du Patriarche de Constantinople est considéré comme une visite d’État, tandis que Pâques se fête sur une semaine en Grèce, avec des processions quotidiennes et une vie au ralenti. Les difficultés rencontrées par les organisateurs des Gay Prides dans ces pays ne sont pas dues au hasard. La Grèce a été réprimandée à plusieurs reprises par la Commission européenne parce qu'elle n'a toujours pas voté un équivalent du PACS, à cause des pressions exercées par l'épiscopat orthodoxe, soutenu par une grande partie de la population.

You very rarely need, see or even hear a foreign language, except maybe some people down the street or some French in a perfume advert. 
The rest of the world has it easier, the first foreign language learned at school in most countries is English. So, what do we learn? Spanish is great, but probably useless in Serbia. Finnish is great, but you can only really speak it in Finland. Even in hostels around Europe people will automatically say 'hey' or 'hi' instead of 'hola' or 'ciao'. 

What I'm trying to get at is that it's much harder for us to learn a language, because unless we actually go to a place where that language is spoken or look for it, we'll never use that language. Most kids at school don't see the point, because well you never really hear that language and if you go there on holiday somebody usually speaks English. So it only really sticks for people who are passionate about languages, whereas (as many people here have already mentioned) in most other countries you would never be able to get a decent job without knowing English, a foreign language.

However if you do study a language, when you go abroad,  try and say something slowly, the person will answer back in fluent English whilst taking the piss out of where you're from.

As far as it's viewed and valued now: they've started teaching it earlier and earlier in recent year, in many places starting in first or second grade now. With life taking place more and more online (be it things such as solutions for little problems, gaming, student exchanges), the English speaking web has far more to offer.


On a slightly different note: one project school here in Hamburg lies in a very diverse area with many immigrants and a big spread in regards to German proficiency. So in order for the kids to not be disadvantaged they just teach most subjects in English from first grade on. Of course there are German classes and all that.

After that it varies greatly as a lot of people don't need it in everyday life, haven't spoken it in years and thus are kinda rusty. However, I also got the impression that it takes them just a little while and they warm up and can speak just fine.

As far as it's viewed and valued now: they've started teaching it earlier and earlier in recent year, in many places starting in first or second grade now. With life taking place more and more online (be it things such as solutions for little problems, gaming, student exchanges), the English speaking web has far more to offer.


On a slightly different note: one project school here in Hamburg lies in a very diverse area with many immigrants and a big spread in regards to German proficiency. So in order for the kids to not be disadvantaged they just teach most subjects in English from first grade on. Of course there are German classes and all that.

&gt; You take minor sarcastic remarks and write walls of text about how bad of a person I am. You think that's honest?

They're not minor remarks, because they're not single and isolated incidents. It's a public forum, meaning more than you and the person you're responding to will read it. And you're a repeat offender - you insist on it being part of the general palette from which you draw for communication. And yes, everything of what I've said is accurate. Just because you're oblivious to the forces shaping the nature of a thread and the effect it has on readers doesn't mean that your conduct is of no consequence.  
Are you a bad person? That depends; yes and no. Do I believe that you have good intentions? No question. Are good intentions enough? Not even close. Plenty of well meaning people have done horrible things. I think you're being negligent at best, and *I think* that negligence is not an attribute we should aspire to and not something that makes someone into a good person.

null,false,grumbal,SVAK,send € for autobahn,null,"MARCIN WASZCZUK (pictured) is ready for action. Dressed in camouflage fatigues with a Polish flag on the shoulder, the heavyset 41-year-old is the head of Strzelec, one of Poland’s largest paramilitary organisations, and he wants to be prepared in case of a Russian attack. His office sits in a notable location: the PAST office block, one of Warsaw’s few pre-war skyscrapers. During the 1944 Warsaw uprising, fighters from Poland’s Home Army, the largest partisan force in Europe, battled for 18 bloody days to seize the building from German troops, and held on until the two-month-long uprising was finally crushed. 

Now Mr Waszczuk wants to draw on Poland’s history of guerrilla warfare to cope with the challenges of an increasingly unpredictable Russia. “We are the continuation of the Home Army,” he says. The goal is to form light infantry units scattered around the country able to continue the fight “if there is an invasion and the Polish military is destroyed"".

These ideas are not entirely far-fetched. In early December, Poland’s defence ministry approved an upgraded national defence plan that includes an effort to co-ordinate better between the regular military and informal paramilitary outfits. Strzelec counts about 5,000 members; several hundred thousand other Polish civilians, including military re-enactment enthusiasts, are thought to be keen on the programme. The military already aids paramilitary groups with surplus uniforms and training sessions.

The strategy also shifts more of Poland’s military assets to its eastern border, in keeping with the so-called Komorowski Doctrine. Bronislaw Komorowski, the president, has pressed the country to focus more on territorial defence and less on far-flung excursions to places like Iraq and Afghanistan. And while reviving the Home Army may seem quixotic, security experts worry that Poland’s army, which still relies heavily on outdated Soviet-era weaponry, would be unable to withstand a full-on Russian attack.

“Is the Polish army prepared? No it is not,” says Zbigniew Pisarski, president of the Casimir Pulaski Foundation, a defence and security think-tank which recently completed an assessment of Poland's military. Mr Pisarski admits that a Russian attack is an “extreme scenario”, but Russia’s actions over the last year in Ukraine have made it seem less improbable. Even before the latest tensions arose, Russia and Belarus had practised a simulated tactical nuclear strike on Warsaw during the 2009 Zapad war games.  

Spooked by the revival of its age-old enemy, Warsaw has embarked on a $30 billion decade-long rearmament programme, one of the most ambitious in NATO. By 2022 the country should have modern missile defences as well as helicopters, tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery, communications and a larger fleet. Poland spends 1.95% of GDP on defence, one of the higher levels in the Atlantic alliance, and has committed to raise that to 2%.

But until the rearmament programme is completed, Poland is vulnerable. Current plans call for Poland to hold off an attack until Poland’s NATO allies can swing into action and come in to help. “One-on-one we have no chance,” says Mr Pisarski. Worryingly, that is largely the same doctrine employed by the Polish military in 1939, when the doctrine was to hold off the Germans long enough for France and Britain to attack. That help never came, forcing Poles to go underground with the Home Army to continue the fight.“We supposedly had a strong alliance in 1939, and no one came to help us,” says Mr Waszczuk. “Now we’re hearing that Germany is in no shape to help us and that NATO is unclear about sending troops here. In the end, the best defence is to rely on yourself.”",null,0,null,1420236396,null,0,false,0,cncjb0d,null,t3_2r4s60,null,t1_cncjb0d,null,t1_cncj216,null,null,null,1425094136,null,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19,null

Ah, the famous myth of the job creator.

Employers don't employ because ""it's easy"" or ""it's cheap"". They employ because they need more hands to keep making more cash. Adding an employee at minimal wage costs 20K. Generally speaking in a country like france the GDP per capita (including pensioners, kids, non workers etc) is 41K/year. It means your average *worker* brings in reality something like 200-300K euros/year to the company.

So, yeah, they'll recruit him whether he costs 20K due to a legal minimal wage, or 5K with none. Except, in one case your employee can pay the rent. In the other, he can't.

Usual myth companies employ when they don't want to pay their employees their wage because the CEO would rather offer himself a new ferrari instead. See also : unpaid internships; foxconn jobs @2 Cts of USD/hour.

Obviously, they're profiting of the deaths of millions of people.

&gt;Have you lived in the UK within the last 10 or 20 years? Aside from the odd ""haha, you're Irish, you like a drink"" dig I have never had anything made out about the fact I am Irish. Certainly I have never experienced any xenophobia.

That's specific to you, confirmation bias. 

&gt;How does this sound "" hahaha British redditors, you lot got your arses handed to you by the yanks during the war for independence!! You lobster wankers!!""

How is being mocked for losing a war against people they oppressed comparable to this at all? Yet again there is no comparison.

&gt; *please please don't report me for xenophobia, British redditors :( :( :(

Trying to invalidate my argument through an ad hominem attack.

&gt;I'd rather not obsess over past events which could hinder the relatively recent improvement in relations with the British.

You know what else would prevent hindering improved relations? Not creating a comedy programme to mock the death of 1.5 million people.

&gt;I have respect for their history and don't think everything is a black and white as you do.

&gt;For every bad thing the British Empire did to Ireland, it did several good things.

And what several good things did the British Empire do for Ireland?

As has already been mentioned, I would not recommend a university in Barcelona because there is a good chance that a lot of the courses are taught in Spanish. So, I would omit Pompeu Fabra University unless you are really flexible on the courses you can take. They do teach some classes there in English, but it can be complicated to find a whole course load in Spanish and English of courses that you need that do not conflict schedule-wise. 

Are you pretty advanced in Spanish already? If not, doing a direct exchange, especially for science courses, is not going to be a good choice for you because following classes in Spanish is hard enough, but science ones? Tough. 

For my students to be able to do an integrated program where they are taking classes in Spanish with local students, they have to have had at least 5-6 semesters of college level Spanish. 

So, if you do not speak Spanish fairly fluently, I would recommend doing a program that is created for international students. The classes will be more limited because they are trying to appeal to a large group of students of various majors, so they will mainly be humanities and Spanish language courses. If you have some free electives, you can likely find a program with 1-2 science courses, but then you'll have to supplement your hours with Spanish language, history, politics, etc. 

I did one of my semesters abroad at the University of Granada. The city is fantastic and I would go back in a heartbeat. Salamanca is pretty popular with international students because it is small enough not to be overwhelming (you can walk most places that you need to go) but there is a big student population so there will be lots of things to do and people to hang out with. I don't have any experience with the other schools.

Only as late as 1947 were cases abolished in the written Dutch standard.

So you are implying they took part in tax evasion, avoidance? based on what information?

The tax authorities in France are not known to be lax


&gt;If going elsewhere is literally the only thing that keeps getting brought up here, the argument is fucked on all fronts.

They are just people who can afford to leave. Hundreds of thousands of Irish emigrate as soon as the economy gets slightly bad. 

All across Europe, the highest earners are generally taxed at the highest rates, and this includes many countries with varying levels of capital gains tax, inheritance tax, property tax and so on. 

It's not like they are endlessly shifting around for a few percent here and there. However, Hollande's supertax was much more severe in comparison.

&gt;Budget deficits do not arise from taxing the wealthy proportionately, don't even dream about such nonsense

The tax wasn't helping the French economy, it was unpopular, and the majority of French people were against it.

Not against it for reasons of principle - against it for reasons of practicality.

null,false,elakol,EURO,European Union,null,"I believe I was 8 years old when I started studying English in primaria(primary school: 6-12 yo). It was mandatory and additional to the Spanish and Catalan(only for Catalonia region) subjects. You would then keep on studying English during secundary(secondary school: 12-16 yo). If you oughted to go to to university you had to do two extra years of English in Bachillerato(16-18 yo).


In fact when I've said English but I should have probably said foreign language. Although most of the schools back in the day were teaching English as foreign language it was optional and proof it was the test you had to perform for accessing university(Selectividad) in which you could choose between several: French, Italian, German and English


Mandatory formation aside, we do not have or used to have any material: tv, cinema, radio, newspapers, magazines, etc widely available in English. The only exception to this was and probably is foreign songs. Shows and films are dubbed to Spanish, Basque, Galician or Catalan languages. So that turns into generations of people who have studied English to some extent but are not proficient at all. The lack of practice and interest(""why would you express any interest on it when everything is in your language?"") is also one of the reasons on why the level is so low.


However, it's becoming clearer and it's quite accepted these days that English is a basic skill to have, that in combination with Spanish, English opens loads of doors. It's pretty much required for ANY job application. These days the kids start with some English way earlier basically when they're in P3(pre-school 3 yo).

Wegen der derzeit sehr niedrigen Rohölpreise haben sich die Verhältnisse zwar zu Ungunsten von Erdgas verschoben, das vom Barrel weitgehend unabhängig ist.

Beim etwas betagten VW Touran sind es bei vergleichbaren Modellen rund 5,20 Euro gegenüber 8,90 Euro, wobei der Preisunterschied von CNG zum Diesel derzeit nicht ganz so groß ist: Für 6,40 Euro benötigt der 140-PS-Selbszünder auf 100 Kilometer. Aber sobald Rohöl wieder teurer wird, spielt CNG seinen Preisvorteil erneut voll aus.

Bald dürfte wieder die Faustregel gelten, die der Verband Erdgas Mobil vor dem Absturz des Rohölpreises nannte: ""Gegenüber Diesel können mit einem [Erdgasfahrzeug](http://a.referata.com/wiki/Erdgasfahrzeug) etwa 30 Prozent eingespart werden.

This:

http://www.oecd.org/std/prices-ppp/8-3012041ec010.pdf

is the section on health from the 'Eurostat-OECD Methodological Manual on Purchasing Power Parities'. Healthcare is included. They use comparisons of market prices for some things, and the pay of government employed doctors, nurses, etc, for others.

There's also a section on education. It looks like they base it on expenditure, with a quality adjustment involving PISA figures.

Of course, not everyone will follow the same methodology. But it looks like the OECD at least does try to include healthcare and education.

&gt; Also, top 1% of the US drives up the number.

GDP is a measure of how much is produced (it's not exactly a measure of people's incomes - if you receive income from abroad (eg, via your investments' overseas operations) then that's not part of GDP). Paying the top 1% less wouldn't necessarily reduce GDP - not unless doing so also reduces the amount of actual stuff (or services) made in the country.

You have to remember the lowest income US state has a median income of $37,000, and the highest right around $70,000.

I should have pointed out a $100,000 house in a small town will be fairly nice. You can find some for $50,000, but they will be in towns somewhat far off the beaten path. If not they will be in parts of the cities you might not want to live in. My parents moved to a town of 5,000 and you can find small but ok houses for $50,000 and there are larger houses in town for $250-400,000. It really just depends how much land is with it, age of the home, upkeep, etc. 

When I was driving through Virginia to go for a hike I saw countless signs for 40 acre (16.2 hectare) plots of land for $40,000, but they were pretty far from civilization.

Really?

You have to be seriously deluded and ignorant if you believe 5% of any section of a population can commit 77% of its crime. The author gives no sources as to where she got her figures, which isn't strange since Sweden does not register criminal's religious or specific ethnic background (they do however record if the subject, or one or both parents are born in Sweden or not). The latest available statistics on the subject of crime commited by people born in Sweden and in other countries is in a study from 2005, in which the authors conclude that socioeconomic factors are the leading cause for criminality, and that the crime rate by those born in Sweden is 5-10% and those outside 12%. Out of those born in other countries than Sweden, Denmark Norway and Finland accounted for 50%. The author does not have any source at all for her claims, besides an obvious christian fanaticism and bigotry.

Here's the study from the governmental bureau of crime prevention, in Swedish: [http://www.bra.se/download](/18.cba82f7130f475a2f1800012697/2005_17_brottslighet_bland_personer_fodda_sverige_och_utlandet.pdf)",null,0,null,1420242253,null,0,false,0,cncmf4u,null,t3_2r55hk,null,t1_cncmf4u,null,t3_2r55hk,null,null,null,1425092683,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

...ben c'est ce que contestent pas mal de gens : le fait qu'un Etat puisse définir cela, tout simplement. Parce que l'Etat, ça n'existe pas. L'Etat, ce sont des factions, des individus, des réseaux et des groupes ayant leurs intérêts propres, leur vision de ce qui est honorable ou non, ce qui mérite d'être récompensé ou non. L'aspect idéologique rejoint des intérêts d'individus, de classe et de groupes sociaux, tout en reposant également sur une conception socialement orientée de ce qui mérite d'être récompensé (et ce que ça signifie réellement) ou non.

Donc ouais, je comprends parfaitement qu'on veuille que l'Etat puisse décerner une telle médaille. C'est ton cas. J'imagine qu'il y a des situations où tu trouves ça bien, d'autres non. Personnellement, je maintiens : de mon point de vue, ce n'est pas à l'Etat de définir ce qui est honorable ou non.

Et cette critique (et ce qu'il y a derrière) est illustrée par des années de distribution industrielle de médailles. A partir du moment où tu permets à un groupe et des réseaux réduits d'individus de distinguer qui est cool et qui ne l'est pas, avec tout le poids d'une administration centrale derrière, c'est parfaitement logique qu'il y ait des abus.

    Although concerned with doctrine and tradition, *Imagining the Catholic Church* is not steeped in Vatican anxiety over orthodoxy. Although attentive to contemporary experiences and intellectual currents, it does not assume the tone of an academic argument. It neither highlights nor ignores the administrative concerns of bishops. It responds to but does not canonize the everyday experiences of pastoral agents. Above all, Lafont, a French Benedictine priest and theologian, reflects on the church from the silence of the monastery. He meditates on the long view. He thinks in centuries. . . .""

    Former House Speaker Tip O'Neil was correct: ""All politics is local,"" even in the Catholic Church.

    The cardinals from the third world have people who are starving and suffering from the negative impact of globalization of the economy. They will want a pope who will speak out for social justice and forgiveness of third-world debt and be willing to stand up to the American superpower. Cardinals from Africa and Asia are confronted by growing Islamic fundamentalism. They will want a pope who understands Islam and will not use inflammatory words like ""crusade,"" as did President George W. Bush. They want a pope who, like John Paul, will support dialogue with Muslims but at the same time stand up for the rights of Catholics.

    On the other hand, in Latin America there are few Muslims. The concern there is the evangelicals and Pentecostals who are ""stealing their sheep.""

    In North America and Europe, the cardinals will want a pope who will continue the fight of Benedict against secularism and relativism but also support ecumenical dialogue with Protestants and Jews. Given the growing alienation of educated women, they would also want someone who projects an understanding of women's concerns. The last thing they would want, for example, is a pope who would decide to get rid of altar girls. The American cardinals would also want someone who understands and supports what they are doing to deal with the sexual abuse crisis. Europeans are concerned about the growing number of Muslims in Europe. . . .""

Atatürk managed to abolish the caliphate, Napoleon and Garibaldi failed to do the same with the papacy. Thus, the Holy See as a stable institution has a political agency effective enough to foster its moral accessibility globally more than others. The Holy See's ambition is higher than to become a chaplain of globalization, which it probably already is, but to shape its very constitutive rules. . . .""

    (c) "". . . At least in terms of public interest, the difference between the election of John Paul's successor and the election of Pope Michael is simple: the man who comes out of the Sistine Chapel wearing white really does become the head of the Roman Catholic Church. Automatically he becomes one of the most important figures on earth, a man (and it *will* be a man) who commands a unique combination of political and spiritual power. Depending on how he chooses to exercise that power, governments and political systems may rise or fall, religious wars may heat up or abate, and the church may relax or rigidify its stance on issues such as women, sexuality, and the role of the papacy itself. Hence the conclave in Rome shares the element of the numinous with what happened in Delia -- the sense of contact with the mysteries of faith -- but it adds the ingredient of very real political consequences. That's what makes the conclave special: it is the Roman Catholic Church in microcosm, a cocktail of ritual, romance, and realpolitik. It is, as both the Bawdens and CNN realize, the greatest show on earth. . . .""

Everybody needs Russia's permission. Georgia in 2008 is a good example. Sweden's location is far ""bigger threat to Russia"" (as everybody is so damn concerned about their point of view all the freakin time). Popular opinion is not clearly in favour of NATO, and remember that Russia inherited the best in the world propaganda machine, remember that popular Swedish TV channels are connected to Kremlin, add internal preparation Russia is doing for the last decade... You see the picture. Sweden is not ready (internally and externally) to apply for membership in NATO, and we all know that EU defence is just a paper tiger.

""Before the war, the Nazis considered mass deportation of German (and subsequently the European) Jewry from Europe. Hitler's agreement to the 1938–9 Schacht Plan, and the continued flight of thousands of Jews from Hitler's clutches for an extended period when the Schacht Plan came to nothing, indicate that the preference for a concerted genocide of the type that came later did not yet exist.""


""Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939 increased the urgency of the ""Jewish Question"". Poland, was home to approximately three million Jews (nearly nine percent of the population), in centuries-old communities, two-thirds of whom fell under Nazi control with Poland's capitulation.
Reinhard Heydrich, Reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia, recommended concentrating all the Polish Jews in ghettos in major cities, where they would be put to work for the German war industry. The ghettos would be in cities located on railway junctions in order to furnish, in Heydrich's words, ""a better possibility of control and later deportation.""[87] During his interrogation in 1961, Adolf Eichmann recalled that this ""later deportation"" actually meant ""physical extermination.""

null,false,mkvgtired,null,null,null,"&gt; it feels like a country with many countries inside it.

To a certain extent it is. States have their own legal systems and laws. These are superseded by federal law, but most laws people follow day to day are set at the state level. This includes most criminal law. Marijuana is a perfect example of this. 23 states have medical marijuana laws. 14 have decriminalized possession for personal use. And 4 states, plus the District of Colombia have fully legalized it for recreational use and licensed cultivation. Ironically the nation's capital legalized it, so it really goes to show which way the nation is heading. But as you can see, within the same country you have everything from somewhat strict marijuana laws to complete legalization and regulated cultivation. 

License plates are all at the state level. Same with drivers licenses. Where it gets really weird is state government services. States are responsible for education but they rely heavily on federal funds. The same goes for roads and other state provided services (which is why the drinking age is 21 across the country. The Federal government did not have the authority to set it but said it would deny federal road funds to any state with a drinking age under 21. Before that, drinking ages were similar to European drinking ages, 16-18). Healthcare is another one. Medicare and Medicaid are the largest health insurers in the US. Both are federal programs, but they are administered at the state level, often using federal funds commingled with state funds. For many purposes native American reservations are considered their own sovereign countries. It can get even weirder but I'll leave it at that.

What is going to happen is that people are going to lose their pensions (they've already taken a big loss with the latest hair cut) and the banks will close down, which will result in small businesses being unable to obtain cash to expand leading to a great increase in unemploment; normal people will be unable to take loans to finance things like new houses, renovation, etc. =&gt; more unemployment.

This is the part I don't agree with, the thing is China and to a lesser extent Russia are more and more appearing as lenders of third resort, China has been buying up bonds from Venezuela and Argentina and there is a whole eastern banking system starting to appear alongside the western one that doesn't care so much if they snub western lenders. 

Russia isn't in a position to do anything now but I could see china lending money with a claim to their new gas reserves backing it up. Either way it may be a credible enough threat to win the concessions they want from the EU/ECB.

We learn Spanish, French and German at secondary school (age 11-16) then we can take it further optionally, but we aren't encouraged to speak it outside of lessons.

Pretty much everywhere else in Europe, especially the richer countries, they are encouraged to learn a second language because of the closer proximity to each other, the easier-to-cross borders and the trilingual countries like Belgium.

The British Isles are limited to sea and air travel (as well as the Eurostar). We can't just drive over the border, even if you want to count the UK/RoI border there's not a lot of language differences on Ireland. So to visit another country we either take a ferry to the continent or fly somewhere. Usually we fly to sunny resorts. Because of how controlled our access to other countries are, there's a disconnect. A German might casually drive to the Netherlands for their shopping if they could or visit a pub. You can't do that in the UK or RoI. When we take a ferry we don't control our own means to going abroad. You couldn't commute on a ferry or on a plane the same way you drive a car to work or just fancy a day trip. 

As well as that, there just isn't much point learning a foreign language, especially if the continent is learning English. A Danishman could learn English and work in Portugal or something and able to communicate in English. If a Briton learns Spanish it's unlikely it'll be useful in Europe outside of Spain, although I've heard it's easy to master Italian, Spanish and French with a little knowledge of Latin, a similar thing can be done with Germanic languages but a lot of us just can't be bothered with all of that. We need to learn a language which will give us access to as many countries as English does. If we were to settle in Spain or Germany, obviously we'd've learned Spanish and German. There's an incentive there because everyone would be speaking it and it's also polite as well and being able to fit it better.

If we were taught a foreign language which would be the most useful in Europe we'd be more bilingual. Problem is everyone else is learning English so we don't need to bother. We also don't have a lot of foreign TV shows of movies here either. Many Dutch people learn English through watching shows like Doctor Who, BBC shows or some American shows, but there's not really an equivalent for English speakers.

As I said, I wish English wasn't as useful in the world so we'd be forced to learn another language and have it be a part of our lives on a daily basis.

Only a month? That's still too long.

&gt; but the normal practice for most Americans is to avoid medical care completely, since even with insurance it costs money they normally don't have.

Most Americans? What are you basing this on? Are you seriously saying that over 50% of Americans avoid medical care completely? What a load of bullshit.

&gt; They can't deny you care, but they will charge you $10,000+ for it.

And if you can't pay it you can push that prize a lot lower, not to mention get it covered. You do of course also have payment plans which combined with a lower price will make it more than managable.

&gt; US has more college graduates because even entry level positions require years experience and a degree now; for-profit education pushes tertiary education as near-mandatory and the gateway to middle-class life

That's what they want you to believe. It's the exact same over here. The truth is that if you go to trades you are guaranteed a job and a good income. Statistics are also saying that those that have gone to college do earn more than those who only have basic schooling. 

&gt; but now US grads have 1 trillion in student debt and 10% of minimum wage earners have a BA.

1 trillion doesn't mean shit when you don't devide it per student.[ If you look at the facts it doesn't look to bad now does it](http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2014/06/24-student-loan-crisis-akers-chingos)? Now, the interesting thing to notice is that me as a Norwegian college student will end up with more student debt than the average American student when taking a bachelor. We don't really hear much about this now do we?

&gt; I mostly have experience following UK politics but the various unitary/devolved systems seem pretty democratic to me; historical/nonpolitical regions electing representatives locally and to the European Parliament from a viable selection of more than 2 identical parties.

And you honestly think that this matters? Instead of 2 identical parties we may have 8 here in Europe. Let's take Germany as an example. The two main opposition parties Labour (SPD) and the Conservatives (CDU) are basically the same. They are even in government together. But you may think, atleast i can vote for another party than those too. Well, you can do that in the U.S as well and you'd get the same results. 

&gt; Honest request, please point me to some literature on the nondemocratic nature of the EU.

Do you really need litterature to support this claim? 

&gt; I am vaguely aware of the contention that Germany disproportionately benefits from a unified currency, but I thought that this currency adoption was by democratic referendum per nation.

It hasn't really. As far as i found out only Sweden and Denmark has had a referendum on adapting the Euro. Funnily enough both have rejected it. A very wise decision when we look at the current situation.

Das ist mMn generell das Hauptproblem der gesamten linkspolitischen Riege, vor allem im Internet: Sie sind furchtbar arrogant und herablassend.

Let me try to phrase it differently. He's creating these products for reasons other than sheer profit. If you go for nothing but growth, for nothing but money, then what you end up doing is turning all available resources into products and exhausting them as quickly as possible. When you do it the other way around - creating products because they make sense from x, y or z perspective and turn a profit while doing it, then you actually get things done more efficiently and without having to burn the ground you stand on at the same time. Your efforts are focused on solving a problem, on doing things like improving or proliferating specific technologies, maybe on changing habits.

Now, an immigrant failing at life and taking up shop as a gangster/drug dealer/trouble maker in general has nothing to do with Islam, but you will see PEGIDA members calling for the deportation of such criminals, as they consider this Islamification too. When  you mention ""Islamification"" and ""Criminal immigrants"" in the same breath, the general narrative that gets created is that Islam in itself is to blame for crime, something which has absolutely no evidence and is contrary to logic. Being an anti-immigrant movement with a name like PEGIDA, it becomes quite hard to understand what they really are protesting against. (Even though [recent studies have show](http://www.dw.de/foreigners-no-burden-on-german-welfare-system/a-18092079) that Germany is benefiting from immigration, but people don't care about facts.)

Similarly, one only needs to visit the official facebook page of PEGIDA to realize that a lot of their commentators are concerned things like some town's christmas market being renamed to Winter market, this too is Islamification to them even though Islam or Muslims had nothing to do with it and it was the government of the leftist party who decided this. The building of Mosques to them also falls under this alleged ""islamification"", and they say they would like to preserve ""Western values"", completely ignoring the fact that building mosques is protected under religious freedom in the same modern democratic values of the West. Not to mention, they are quite conservative and against homosexual parades etc. Of course, there are always the loonies who think Germany is being Islamified because a Muslim candidate got elected to parliament or some nonsense like that, but I prefer to ignore them.

I think that some these concerns of the people are quite legitimate, and that Frau Merkel would need to address them in a more profound manner than to just dismiss PEGIDA as racists, even though a considerable support for this movement comes from far right and neo-nazi circles. Sure, their name is quite badly chosen and it perpetuates this anti-muslim sentiment in the general populace which results in a polarized society. I for example, being an immigrant myself, fully support the notion that criminal immigrants, specially multiple offenders should be deported. I also support a no tolerance policy for people who exploit the welfare system of the country and also those who want to practice hate speech and radical beliefs (according to official studies, Germany has around 7000 Salfists, or Islamist fundamentalists). As long as mainstream parties fail to address these concerns, people will continue to march with such shady and dubious movements.

&gt; Are you seriously saying that over 50% of Americans avoid medical care completely? 

I did not mean that Americans avoid medical care completely, but that they do without it whenever possible. Flu? Just keep going to work. Bad flu? Take a few days off and lay in bed. Doctor's visit isn't the go-to, because it's too much money.

My SO had to delay serious medical care for 2-3 years until we could afford it. My SO had insurance and we were both employed that entire time. [33% of Americans](http://www.gallup.com/poll/179774/cost-barrier-americans-medical-care.aspx) delay medical care, 2/3rds of them for serious conditions.

&gt;  If you look at the facts it doesn't look to bad now does it

This is making a big assumption about the lifetime earnings of current generation based on previous lifetime earnings, which I contest. Earnings is stagnant. I agree, Norwegian student debt is a problem. Everyone should have a free education.

EDIT Also, [11.5% of student debt is 90+ days delinquent or in default](http://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2014/02/21/1-trillion-student-loan-problem-keeps-getting-worse/), double the percent in 2003. Seems like US grads can't really afford it after all.

&gt; Let's take Germany as an example.

Germany has at least several cities and states actually governed by non-binary parties, such as Baden-Württemberg with Green Party. I'm also dubious that Social Democrats and Christian Democrats are the same, but I have to learn more about Germany/Europe at large. As far as I can tell, the CDU is roughly as conservative as US Democrats, and the SPD are further left, with Die Linke and Green holding significant amount of offices.

&gt; Do you really need litterature to support this claim? 

I'm uneducated, not necessarily opposed to your claim. I'll learn more myself.

&gt; As far as i found out only Sweden and Denmark has had a referendum

I looked at a couple other countries:

* Poland appears to be dragging its feet on adoption due directly from public opposition/polling
* Bulgaria is planning on joining and has majority support,
* Latvia had a referendum in 2003 about joining the EU which included the Euro, which passed,
* Denmark also had a referendum to join the Euro, which failed,
* Czech Republic popularly opposes adoption, and has no plans to join,
* Hungary 64% is in favor of joining the euro but the gov't blocks progress by not seeking ERM II membership

So to not intervene would be to allow thousands of your fellow countrymen to be slaughtered, NATO to shatter, and your forward strategic cohesive line broken. Basically, it would never happen -- especially not against a country like Russia who in all likelihood couldn't even fund such an offensive; let alone stop NATO from urinating on their face and forcing them to like it.

null,false,airelle,,Banlieue,null,"The ""one month worth"" info is outdated and is now illegal in most big cities (you'd pay more than legally allowed) : the law recently changed, capping these agency fees. The law, named Loi ALUR, was passed in the Spring, and has been effective since mid-September.

The new caps are:

- Paris + inner circle suburbs (92, 93, 94) : 12€/m²

- Zone tendue (see the list [here](http://www.la-loi-alur.org/zone-tendue/)) : 10€/m²

- Rest of France : 8 €/m²

So if you were to rent a 25m² appt in Paris, the most you can be charged is 300€. For a 40 m² appt, you'd be charged at most 480€

The same apartments in Lyon would have fees of 250€ and 400€ respectively.

To this they can add the ""entering/exiting check-up"" (""états des lieux"") fees which are also capped, at 3€/m² regardless of the city. So at most 75€ and 120€ respectively for the two examples I gave.

To answer the original question, these fees include:

- visiting costs (when you went to see if it was worth renting)

- creating your file at the agency and filling/filing it

- writing of the contract

+ the ""etats des lieux"" which has its own cap but is paid at the same time.",null,0,null,1420251145,null,0,false,0,cncqt22,null,t3_2r3aqh,null,t1_cncqt22,null,t3_2r3aqh,null,null,null,1425090636,null,3,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,3,null

Also, nobody wants to see a country, any country, leaving either Europe or the Eurozone, it would be a big hit to the European project

Moreover, if SYRIZA is smart, they should not enter negotiations with an attitude, but rather seek measures to ease the burden and accelerate development while keeping the agreements intact. In other words simply say ""with this situation we cannot survive, give us alternatives"" (note: they are not smart)

Finally, I do not think SYRIZA really means any of their bullshit. They are a left party, known for populist policies that won't be implemented at all.

null,false,TheEndgame,NORW,Norway,null,"&gt; I did not mean that Americans avoid medical care completely, but that they do without it whenever possible. Flu? Just keep going to work. Bad flu? Take a few days off and lay in bed. Doctor's visit isn't the go-to, because it's too much money.

Most people don't go to the doctor for a flu here either. You try to avoid it as much as possible if you know for certain that it's not serious. Wouldn't suprise me that some students delay it as well as there is a $40 charge when visiting the doctor. 

&gt; My SO had to delay serious medical care for 2-3 years until we could afford it. My SO had insurance and we were both employed that entire time. 33% of Americans delay medical care, 2/3rds of them for serious conditions.

I'm saddened to hear that, but considering your situation (job and insurance) i doubt this is a very normal problem. In the survey you linked to over 50% answered that they were uninsured, which can explain the answers. But it's not really representative when the reality is that 87% of the U.S population have insurance.

&gt; This is making a big assumption about the lifetime earnings of current generation based on previous lifetime earnings, which I contest.

I don't see how it should decrease either. Especially considering the amount of people leaving the labour force when the baby boomers retire. And as we all know, a shortage of workers mean increased wages.

&gt; I agree, Norwegian student debt is a problem. Everyone should have a free education.

But is this debt a large problem though? Even though i will graduate with around $24k student debt i'm not actually worried. Student loans have in most cases good terms and there is no problem getting a new payment plan. The best case would of course be to have it all free, but i don't see that as realistic. 

&gt; EDIT Also, 11.5% of student debt is 90+ days delinquent or in default, double the percent in 2003. Seems like US grads can't really afford it after all.

If you are going to prioritize debts, student loans go on the bottom. They are not the biggest problem and the fact is that these loans are easy to change or even default on. A lot can be done by simple financial planning. In other words prioritize paying down on your loan instead of the newest Iphone. Another factor is that the economy in 2003 were much better than now.

If we can go back to Norway for a second. Starting this year student loans will need to be paid back every month instead of 4 times a year. ""Lånekassen"" (where you get student loans from) are expected to more than double their income from fees related to late payments. So we can conclude that people can't afford paying them down, or that they are just lazy with their financial planning? I'm assuming the latter.

&gt; Germany has at least several cities and states actually governed by non-binary parties, such as Baden-Württemberg with Green Party.

Don't be fooled by this. SPD got more than double their votes and rules in a coalition. Basically Winfried Kretschmann is a puppet for SPD. But maybe it was about time with a change considering CDU have been in power for 58 years in a row. 

&gt; As far as I can tell, the CDU is roughly as conservative as US Democrats, and the SPD are further left

Their are all centre, but with some policies that they don't agree on. In practice they are the same though. 

&gt; with Die Linke and Green holding significant amount of offices.

Not unusual in city/county governments. Not much influence though and most is pre determined. Local politics you know.

&gt; I'm uneducated, not necessarily opposed to your claim. I'll learn more myself.

I recommend you to do so. But for the record it should be noted that democracy is more and more useless the larger amount of people that participates. As the saying goes: ""Democracy is tyranny of the majority"" goes well. The EU don't give a shit about a large part of the union because you can't please anyone.

&gt; It seems roughly in line with governments following the will of the popular opinion in their nation, even without popular referendums, except Hungary.

Genau.

&gt; Bevor man den Zwergen Programmieren beibringt, sollte man lieber mal das Thema Medienkompetenz/Mediennutzung in die Lehrpläne bringen und dann in einem zweiten Schritt Informatik als Fach stärken. 

Wie willst du echte Medienkompetenz vermitteln ohne dabei [Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie-Hellman-Schl%C3%BCsselaustausch) abzuarbeiten? Das Ding, womit zwei Leute in aller Öffentlichkeit, jeder hört zu, sich auf einen privaten Schlüssel (""eine Zahl"") einigen können womit sie dann weiteres abhörsicher verschlüsseln können. 

Frag' mal den nächsten Erwachsenen den du triffst: Die Menschen gehen idR davon aus dass das unmöglich ist... dabei benutzen sie's jedes mal wenn sie ne Verbindung per HTTPS aufbauen, zu amazon oder sonstwo.

Anders ausgedrückt: Die Menschen glauben, im Rechner sitzen kleine magische Männchen die das alles organisieren.

Die Mathematik dahinter ist nicht schwer, man kann das ganze (mit kleinen Zahlen) die Schüler selbst machen lassen: Divisionsrest, potenzieren, das sollte in der 3. oder 4. doch wohl zu machen sein.

Es geht *nicht* um's programmieren. Es geht darum dass heutzutage jeder *im Prinzip* versteht was er unter der Motorhaube hat, auch wenn er keinen Motor selbst bauen (programmieren) könnte. Vielleicht mal gesehen haben und sehr einfaches gemacht haben, ja. Aber das ist es wirklich nicht worauf es ankommt wenn wir von *Kulturtechniken* reden.

Wie sortiert man ein Kartenspiel am besten? Wenn du im Telefonbuch oder Wörterbuch nachschlägst, fängst du dann bei A an? In der Mitte zwischen M und N? Ja? Warum? 

Für das ganze Zeug braucht es keine Computer. Auf der anderen Seite: *Ja*, es braucht Informatik. Unbedingt. Über das was heutzutage so als ""Medienkompetenz"" durchgeht schütteln Informatiker genau so den Kopf wie du über's th, und mit Informatik auf Lehramt studieren wird's auch nicht gerettet werden: 

Das normale Studium an sich garantiert ja auch nicht dass man am Ende von irgendwas Ahnung hat. Das grundlegende Problem in der Informatik ist dass wir nicht wirklich wissen, wie man gewisse *Denkweisen* beibringt.

It always adopts the view that these groups are a ""grassroots [...] movement"", and even more controversially as having ""shaken the political establishment"". Both claims are shallow and hollow - the former could apply to any group, and the latter isn't even attempting to hide its propaganda: It's as if it was literally taken from the aims of the group/the group manifesto, itself.

We then see the citing of a few scary (and, I imagine, misleading) statistics in an attempt to entice fear in people - words like ""two-decade high"" (was net migration always this high and/or increasing during those two decades, or is it just this single year that it's been slightly higher than usual?), and ""four times the number"" (was 2014 exceptionally high, or 2012 exceptionally low? When the very purpose of asylum seekers is to be accepted on humanitarian reasons, ""quotas"" don't make sense pertaining to the spirit of the system; and a 0.25% increase of the population is negligible compared to the 0.287% decrease of the population due to ""natural increase"" alone).

The longer we fall for all this propaganda, the more we will look back with regret and shame fifty years down the line when Germany, already considerably below its replacement fertility rate, watches itself die of an aging population, much like every other country around it.

&gt; considering your situation (job and insurance) i doubt this is a very normal problem

56% of the people in the poll had insurance (since it's over 12 months it totals over 100%), and 66% made more than 30k. It's not too uncommon, sadly.

&gt; the fact is that these loans are easy to change or even default on

That's not the case in the US: you can't move your loan, but the company can sell your loan and the new company can make new terms (usually worse), and you cannot default on student debt in the US, they will garnish your wages. If you miss a single payment, you're considered in default, the entire debt is now due, affects your credit score, you lose eligibility for forbearance or repayment plans for 7 years.

&gt; But maybe it was about time with a change 

Agreed! The growth of a new far-right in many European countries is worrying.

&gt; Not much influence though and most is pre determined. Local politics you know.

Doesn't feel that way in the US. I hope that's not the case in Europe. How little power is devolved from national to regions/cities, in general?

&gt; democracy is more and more useless the larger amount of people that participates. 

Like my previous reply, isn't that the point of federation, devolution, and limited local autonomy? Sometimes I bemoan the fragmented nature of US governance, since I think too much is devolved to regions, but you appear to think too little is devolved in the EU.

&gt; You can't have a similar currency for such vastly different economies. It's logical.

You too. I love a civil discussion now and then! :)

&gt; 56% of the people in the poll had insurance (since it's over 12 months it totals over 100%), and 66% made more than 30k. It's not too uncommon, sadly.

That's not good, but i can't help to feel that it's not as bad as it seems. My impression when talking to Americans is that there are cases like this, but in general life is pretty allright.

&gt; That's not the case in the US: you can't move your loan, but the company can sell your loan and the new company can make new terms (usually worse), and you cannot default on student debt in the US, they will garnish your wages. If you miss a single payment, you're considered in default, the entire debt is now due, affects your credit score, you lose eligibility for forbearance or repayment plans for 7 years.

Don't you get loans from the state?[ On this site you find lot's of information relating to downpayment](https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/default/avoid). Doesn't seem too unreasonable to me.

&gt; Agreed! The growth of a new far-right in many European countries is worrying.

Please don't lump the far-right together with traditional conservative parties like CDU. They're not really compareable. While i'm not to fond it the many far-right and left parties coming to power around Europe i can't say i'm suprised. The way Europe has handled the crisis have been horrible, and i can see why people vote more radically.

&gt; Doesn't feel that way in the US. I hope that's not the case in Europe. How little power is devolved from national to regions/cities, in general?

I would say regions and cities have less power in Europe than in the U.S. Local politics in Europe is mostly about city/region development and there is not much room to change taxes and laws. Switzerland may be the exception here. It's of course not optimal as local politics is where the average person has the most influence.

&gt; Like my previous reply, isn't that the point of federation, devolution, and limited local autonomy?

It certainly is, but that's my biggest problem with the EU. Bureaucrats in Brussels pass laws that may work out well for someone who lives in a large city, but hurt those who live on the countryside. 

&gt; Sometimes I bemoan the fragmented nature of US governance, since I think too much is devolved to regions, but you appear to think too little is devolved in the EU.

Exactly! I admire the way regions and cities have more power in the U.S. After all the people who live in the region knows best what is best for them. They can't have too much power though. National interests must come above local ones. 

&gt; That's not obvious to me; Wyoming prairie herders and Chicago pizza parlors all use the almighty dollar. I can only imagine the headache if the US had 50 different currencies. I fear poor people would probably not have been able to afford to move across state lines.

The U.S is interesting in this regard. I don't feel they can be compared to the Eurozone in this regard. Keep in mind the GDP per capita in the Eurozone varies from $100k in Luxembourg to $21k in Latvia. That's a huge difference and much larger than the difference between Delaware ($61k) and Mississippi ($29k). 

Another factor is that the U.S has developed pretty similarly, while the EU has vast differences in development and economy. While Germany is very reliant on exports, France is more reliant on imports. This creates a dilemma as Germany wants a weak currency while France wants a strong currency. 

Moving over state lines shouldn't be any problem. We didn't have this problem in Europe before the Euro either. Many people argue that it's so much easier to travel from a country that use the Euro and to another. Even though Norway doesn't use the Euro i have no problem currency when travelling abroad. I mostly use a debit card anyways and the amount gets converted automatically.

Here is the missing piece, that explains the 'crying' you refer to: Of the sum of money Greece recieved the last 7-8 years in the manner of the Greek government taking loans, most of it have gone to a handful of private businesses (banks) in Greece, unlike what seems to be the popular opinion, that supposedly in Greece the government has been offering luxurious benefits to its citizens.


What has been hapenning the last years in Greece, is that the government systematically took loans from foreigners, indebting the country, handing billions to a few 'golden boys' who in turn invest to the pre-elections campaigns of politicians. A clique, a mafia, made by politicians and bankers is getting richer in orders of billions shared between them, while the simple citizens of Greece recieve nothing, yet they are asked to pay back the loans taken. 


That's why Greeks are crying, protesting, etc. The average Greek nowdays doesn't vote having as criteria the ideology or plan of a party, but betting on who of all the parties are less likely to be corrupted, to prevent the country from rising its debt even more.

Je connais des gens qui votent FN mais qui n'osent pas vraiment le dire. Ce n'est pas parce qu'ils en ont honte. S'ils avaient honte, c'est qu'ils savent que c'est une mauvaise solution, et donc ils ne voteraient pas pour ce parti en premier lieu.

Ich habe ein paar Staaten bereisen dürfen mit muslimischer Bevölkerungsmehrheit und in einem auch ein bißchen länger verweilt und fand die einfachen Leute eigentlich ganz nett, neugierig und gastfreundlich (außer in den Emiraten).

It's possible that higher payed CEOs would have performed better or that the mismanagement caused by the new managers hasn't taken its toll on the profit just yet.

b) This doesn't take into account the possibility that while perhaps the new CEOs are very competent and successful, that they just might be underpaid. Perhaps they didn't take into account all of the risks they were taking while applying for the job? If you agree that some people can be underpaid in their jobs, we should also consider it in this case. Maybe they were too impressed with the wage number and prestige that they forgot that when the company should go down that they are accountable (ideally).

c) In effect though I approve this initiative, sort of. If there were willing and very competent candidates for the job at a lower wage, then probably the real worth of these people is around that level. I don't think any company should just pay their CEOs more, as long as they can find people working there for less money.

I am not sure why /r/Europe feels so strongly about this issue, but it sure does. 

&gt;Perhaps it's a negotiating tactic, but from an outsider point of view, it seems that it's the Greeks that are the ones who are being intransigent.

The problem is kinda transmiting subcontext. Many statements to us and from us are obviously proxy statements for other issues at the time.  Like, when they named the airport Alexandros the week after we veto'd their nato application or various statements from our president.

I am obviously not blaming FYROM's government alone for the failure of negotiation (I do blame them partially for sure though). I mean, our government is incredibly incompetent in every way, including this one. However, we are in the stronger position and yet they keep being aggressive about the issue.

That's the American gamble. Life is alright until it's medical bankrupcy. [1.7 million](http://www.cnbc.com/id/100840148) Americans file for bankruptcy because of medical debt per year, and [70 million](http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/20/us-medicaldebt-idUSN1932186920080820) struggle with medical debt. The British I've spoken to expressed how bizarre and unnatural that sounds. I'd hoped that was as unusual across the EU as it is typical in the US. I know plenty strapped with medical debt personally. It's a hideous percentage of my own yearly budget, by itself more than most pay in taxes in the EU.

&gt; Don't you get loans from the state? 

The federal nation and the states are prone to selling your loans to pay it's debts, and the private debt-holders expect to make good on their purchase. That site is for debts still held by the state, which can be the minority to begin with, and is far from certain to continue with you as you pay them. Financial markets being big here, your debt is sure to be repackaged and sold before you finish paying it. The private companies do not have as many options for repackaging or repayment.

&gt; Please don't lump the far-right together with traditional conservative parties like CDU. They're not really compareable.

Politics is complicated enough that I'm paraphrasing in too-quick snippets. I didn't mean to compare 58 years of CDU to the new far-right that, to my understanding, is surging because the center-left like SDP lost support lately when they ceded to austerity and other center-right shenanigans in wake of the Greek debt crisis during the global recession that started in 08. Swedish Democrats, UKIP, etc is nothing like the CDU, and I understand that.

&gt; I admire the way regions and cities have more power in the U.S.

It just makes the US a land of extremes in what I consider a bad way. There are very far-right areas, and there are centrist areas, instead of the whole thing being mostly centrist.

&gt; the GDP per capita in the Eurozone varies from $100k in Luxembourg to $21k in Latvia. That's a huge difference and much larger than the difference between Delaware ($61k) and Mississippi ($29k). 

Luxemboug is unrealistic to include, with 500k citizens, unless you want to include District of Columbia with $146k GDP per capita.

&gt; the U.S has developed pretty similarly, while the EU has vast differences in development and economy

The US Farm bill is a fascinating document each year, where subsidy, right-wing, and development disparity are in high relief. What Wyoming herders and Beltway lawyers want is pretty...unlike. I've driven past highway exits that explicitly told me not to get off unless I was local.

&gt; Moving over state lines shouldn't be any problem. 

US companies will not hesitate at ANY opportunity to nickle and dime the American people to death. If we had 50 currencies, we'd be arbitraged to death at the state line and there is no way around that.

EDIT: I say this because states fight each other to give gigantic concessions to companies that are transparently playing them against one another for tax benefits, all for the dubious benefit of a few hundred to thousand jobs the politicians can claim on the next election cycle.

Potevi risparmiarti il chi caz è, visto che è uno degli autori contemporanei più popolari. Comunque credo proprio di no. Spero piuttosto in Delillo o Pynchon, anche se temo non andrà neanche a uno di loro.

&gt;La Grecia sarà ancora nell'Euro?

La Grecia sta collassando. Se dovesse uscire dall'Euro i partiti euroscettici (e quelli nazionalisti e xenofobi) avrebbero un'impennata incredibile. Spero di no e credo di no, faranno di tutto perché rimanga.

null,false,mkvgtired,null,null,null,"&gt; The only country whose politicians weren't treacherous scumbags and prioritized the people instead of the fucking bankers was Iceland which has recovered much better and much faster than both US and EU.

Iceland shifted the financial burden to its depositor countries. It changed the law guaranteeing all deposits to cover only Icelandic citizen deposits the day before the the government took over banks, hanging its ""insured"" European customers out to dry. It certainly was not looking out for its European customers who deposited funds with the assumption they were insured. This left European nations on the hook for tens of billions of Euros worth of deposits that were supposedly insured. These European countries now have to wait 50 years to be reimbursed by Iceland. They are the ones who bailed out Iceland's greatly underfunded government insurance program. This was on top of crises they were already managing back home. 

Iceland also [devalued its currency](http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=ISK&amp;amp;to=USD&amp;amp;view=10Y) by roughly 50%. Sixty-one percent of the world's reserve wealth is held in US Dollars, and 24% is held in Euros. If either of those currencies were devalued 50% there would have been chaos, and not only in the US and Europe. 

These are just some of the reasons comparing Iceland to the US or Europe is like comparing apples and oranges. Long story short, the US, Eurozone, or UK didn't have another jurisdiction they could dump their burden on all while inflating away much of the problem, Iceland did.

really? ""independent"" means that you can disregard all the treaties that you, as a nation, have signed? ""it's your own choice"" because there is no exit procedure from the euro?

please, do clarify.

politics aside, i think there are some facts:

1. pretty much the only country who really benefitted from a euro built the way it is is germany. all the news i know from any other country in europe say that there is a *significant* crisis. spain, italy, portugal, greece... but also france, netherlands (cutting the welfare state is never a good sign), countries in the east (i don't think that, say, poles or bulgarians love to leave their country, family and friends just because, for example).
2. if one country, no matter how small, exits the euro because it is no longer convenient to stay in it, then the euro, as a currency has failed, and it will pretty much become a non grata currency. read [this](http://business.time.com/2012/05/22/euro-crisis-why-a-greek-exit-could-be-much-worse-than-expected/), specificately the ""Greece recovers quickly, and all the other troubled countries want out of the euro zone too."" paragraph, at the end. if anyone who wants out form the euro can get out, then the currency becomes meaningless, because anyone, at somepoint, will get out.

i might come across as anti-german. i'm not. germany has a rich history, and i have many friends over there. what i am against is idiotic puppets in the hands of great capital, effectively blackmailing entire countries, bullying them to vote a certain party or another.

this is so much against the spirit of 50 years of european union that it is embarassing that it should be brought up in a discussion. if the european union is dead, and it is certainly struggling, then let's just agree to go back to the good old days of ""everyone for themselves"" and let's see who is the biggest bastard. probably not my country (italy), but at least i could finally avoid being lectured day in, day out by a foreign ass about what is best for me.",null,0,null,1420273358,null,0,false,0,cnczvzs,null,t3_2qy9iv,null,t1_cnczvzs,null,t1_cnb4aqo,null,null,null,1425086259,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

it works like this (or it should): the EU gives you money to do things. then you show to the EU what you've done with the money, then you get more money, or less money, or no money. if you take 1 euro to build a school and use it to pay a drink to your pal, then the EU doesn't give you the euro anymore.

so: all these politicians complaining about the crazy situation in greece... where exactly were they, say, 10 years ago? greece had a conservative government. didn't merkel meet these guy for a drink, after one of them fancy EU meetings?

i know italian politicians routinely meet their european partners. what the brit, or the french, or the german, or the spanish, or [you name it] partner say at these meetings must have some relevance. we have someone, in the EU, looking after our budget and expenditures.

what happened? one of two things:

1. everyone was too stupid to see that greece was running into a wall. in this case, sorry, but it's only fair that *everybody* pays for the mistakes. if i have someone reviewing the accounts and that someone is inept, then he can't blame me, because he is as much to blame.

2. nobody cared, because it was good to give greece cash to buy shit they didn't need. in this case, well... not everybody has to pay. you just need to follow the money, don't you?

the measures imposed on greece actually killed people. i'm not talking about suicides of desperate ex-workers. i'm talking about the people who die because the hospital has to shut down because there is no money anymore and you can't buy a fucking drug that could save lives.

when i was little, if a group of countries caused massive unrest and death of civil population to another country, it didn't look too good. someone could even cry ""war!"" and have something to show to justify their claims.

now, not only we maintain that the greeks are the sole cause of their problems (even if they're not), not only we maintain that they should endure whatever ""the troika"" feels like as a punishment for their economic collapse (even if it actually gets worse thanks to these measures), but we also turn up at a public press conference and pretty much say that they are insignificant and they can go and fuck themselves.

and people are surprised that there is so much resentment against the EU.",null,0,null,1420274195,null,0,1420968835,0,cnd03o1,null,t3_2qy9iv,null,t1_cnd03o1,null,t1_cnbavbj,null,null,null,1425086159,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

&gt; Ah, the famous myth of the job creator.
 
&gt; Employers don't employ because ""it's easy"" or ""it's cheap"". They employ because they need more hands to keep making more cash. Adding an employee at minimal wage costs 20K. Generally speaking in a country like france the GDP per capita (including pensioners, kids, non workers etc) is 41K/year. It means your average worker brings in reality something like 200-300K euros/year to the company.

Sigh. The risk of hiring a person isn't does he or she cost too much at the point of hiring, but how much does that person cost later. For example today a company could see upward trend in demand and hiring an employee might make sense, however demand may go down later and there isn't anymore work for that person. The risk of hiring especially in central and southern Europe is that it is highly costly and hard to fire any body.

As long as firing people is hard and costly, employees will first try to find alternative ways to respond to a demand: increase of automation; increase working hours for current workers; outsourcing of work; or just not responding to demand.

You might want to look on how things are handled in Denmark. In Denmark the job market is highly dynamic, it is easy for companies to hire and fire, however because unemployment and social benefits are relatively high, for your average worker this compensates the more turbulent working environment.

Even if the rolling stock is available, it may not be at the right place at the right time -- you can't add extra cars in Frankfurt if the nearest spare car is in Nuremberg. But more importantly, lengthening the train might make it too long for most stations. As for running more trains, they do that at busy times, but again: the rolling stock has to be available, and there has to be room for them in the timetable -- because high-speed rail crashes tend to be very nasty, lines are divided into sections and only one train is allowed in each sections at a time. Plus, of course, there are many places where high-speed trains run on the same tracks as local trains. This causes all sorts of problems: for example, there are still many local stations where, whenever a train in one direction stops, passengers have to cross the other line to alight or board. This means that, for example, when a local train bound for Hanau is stopped at Großkrotzenburg, no long-distance train travelling towards Würzburg may leave Hanau.

&gt; make sure the WCs are clean/usable

Sort of not possible when the train is as crowded as described.

&gt; It's not some unsolvable mystery that trains get crowded at certain times of the year/day

It's not a mystery, but solving it is a work in process. You know all those engineering works that cause delays and diversions, and that people complain about all the time? That's them working on solving the problem. That Stuttgart 21 project that nobody wants? DB wants it, because it will turn Stuttgart Hbf into a through station instead of a terminus, a terminus being one of the principal causes of bottlenecks in the system. Another notorious bottleneck will be relieved somewhat in the next couple of years when they've finished building a tunnel under the Spessart; a proposal to relieve the same bottleneck even further, along with a second one, is being discussed, but is fiercely opposed by some local politicians because it would leave Aschaffenburg without any long-distance connections.

Well, I think it's fair to point out that everyone else on the train was having as bad a day as you were.

I will say that German trains are usually very good, but the long-distance trains do tend to be overbooked much of the time, and things don't always work perfectly. Now that coach companies are allowed to compete directly with the railways, this might improve slightly.

Membership is voluntary and conditions have been clear all along. They could not have joined. Membership have however been a great benefit for all nations besides Germany, in that they have been able to, and continue to be able to, obtain loans at greatly reduced interests than they would otherwise have been able to. That some nations used to economic windfall to go on a decade long lending and spending spree, using the borrowed funds to fund their nation instead of carrying through badly needed reforms, well can't really say that it's an issue of the union except if you think it should have carried more stringent rules and punishments.

&gt;How far do you think I can get in this time if I put in a couple of hours practice every day?

If you actually put in at least two hours of practice every day, you should be able to get to a basic speaking level (enough for her to be impressed). However, that depends on if you've studied other languages before, because if not, it'll take a while to get used to grammatical gender and the case system--basically why adjectives start randomly changing based on the articles that precede them and the nouns that follow them.

&gt;Is it worth watching any German TV...

Not until you have a solid basis in German vocabulary and grammar. Once you can read, say, a newspaper article and get the gist (maybe not all the specifics, but at least for instance knowing who won an election and vaguely what their position is) of it without looking up words, then watching German TV becomes essential.

&gt;...or listening to German music?

Not essential, but worth it if you like the music you're listening to. While it's hard to find subtitled TV shows (well, maybe it would be if it weren't for ZDF), it's easy to find musical lyrics, so you can follow along and look up words. Music tends to have a very basic vocabulary set, which makes it ideal for beginners.

My only other piece of basic general advice is to drill the articles and adjectives over and over again until they come naturally. There are some patterns behind them which are rather extensive but nonetheless somewhat intuitive, so try to look for them (especially keeping ""weak"" and ""strong"" endings in mind), and it'll help you along. Soon enough *der guter Mann* (as a beginner would guess) will sound weird, and you'll know it needs to be *der gute Mann*.

...one that completely annihilates the small car but fails to do any of the damage it believes it may inflict on the truck.  In fact, the damage that it can inflict on others is somewhere between negligible and a minor nuisance.

Remember this: if the so called troika is able to roll out some hundred billion euros to waste on Greece's default, it is also quite able to do the exact same thing to bail out any creditor that may fell victim of Greece's unwillingness to pay.   And Greece's total debt is only an insignificant fraction when compared with the EU's GDP.

Then, if that happens, while everyone recovers from a bump in the road, Greece's government is still forced to either cut well over 10% of its budget while battling rampant inflation, bank runs, capital flight, mass unemployment, and above all social problems caused by the worsening crisis.  Meanwhile, the only potential lenders in the world are the ones that were screwed over by Greece, who won't be willing to get burnt a second time around.

null,false,nuephelkystikon,native-alemannic,native (Alemannisch),null,"This sentence is actually ambiguous. Technically, it could also mean ""The bread gives Anna to me"".

For finding out what the subject is, there are three options:

1. Case. If there is exactly one word that is unambiguously a nominative, it will always be the subject. In this example, that excludes *mir* (which is a dative). However, both *Anna* and *das Brot* could be either nominative or accusative. This is a typical problem of feminine and neuter nouns as well as proper names.
2. Verb agreement. The verb *gibt* is a 3^(rd) singular. Again, that makes it impossible for *mir* to be the subject (or it would have to be the 1^(st) person *gebe*). However, both *Anna* and *das Brot* would require 3^(rd) singular if they were the subject. That leaves only one method:
3. Semantics. Bread doesn't hand out people. Conversely, in a sentence like *Anna gibt das Brot Sättigung*, it is clear only from semantics that *Anna* must be a dative object, *das Brot* must be the subject and *Sättigung* is an accusative object, and that therefore the meaning must be *The bread gives Anna satiety*.

The western lenders soon changed their tune is what happened 

&gt;When Iceland announced it was seeking a $6bn (£4bn) loan from Russia to help rescue its crisis-ravaged economy, some in the NATO alliance, of which Iceland is a member, took fright.

&gt;They suspected that Russia was acting to further its geopolitical interests in the region in the guise of a white knight.

More personal memories: brother of my grandfather in 1939 was prisoned by Germans. He was on the list of his German neighburs. The reason was that he was a mayor of a willage. My grandma was trying to give him something to eat by night. Some days ago he was hung by Grermans. Like many others Polish VIP's at that time. FU /u/magadet.

&gt;Secondly, what is so different in Russia's occupation of a part of Ukraine, compared to a full scale war initiated by the US, who lied about it intentionally? US openly supports giving weapons to Syrian Rebels, a lot of which were close to ISIS and committed war crimes of their own.

Logical fallacy. I am neither a member of the political elite, nor a representative of the totality of the country in which I happen to reside.  I can say both are wrong and equally levee the criticism I have against Russia. If I had it my way Cheney would be in jail for war-crimes. Similarly if the world bent to my will we'd have world-peace and invest heavily in space-exploration -- so what?

Equating the two events is asinine. Although I get an inkling trying to explain the intricacies of the two conflicts would be wasted effort.

&gt; The article also says,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Russia's renewed interest in Nuke Trains is ***said to be a response to America's Conventional Prompt Global Strike project***, which looks towards a cocktail of ***hypersonic air-breathing missiles and aircraft as well as possibly ballistic missiles, and even space-based weaponry, to hit a target within an hour, anywhere on globe.***

--

'Said to have been'. Furthermore there is no evidence the program has yielded anything; neither is the US the only country researching hyper-sonic weapons. A program that, in part, stepped up after the failure to secure missile defense sites in eastern-Europe. But again you're equating the deployment of *defensive missile batteries to Russia invading another country.*

Remember what happened in Iceland when they used geopolitical threats as leverage? I have always argued Ireland should be playing hard ball instead of being the submissive little American puppet state it's become today. 

The western lenders soon changed their tune after Iceland turned to Russia for help

&gt;When Iceland announced it was seeking a $6bn (£4bn) loan from Russia to help rescue its crisis-ravaged economy, some in the NATO alliance, of which Iceland is a member, took fright.

&gt;They suspected that Russia was acting to further its geopolitical interests in the region in the guise of a white knight.

&gt;Reports of Russia seeking - or even securing - rights to Icelandic fisheries, energy and metal sectors, as well as in tourism, poured fuel on these fears.

1. Kosovo - Kosovo PM said that it's time for the optimism expressed by citizens of Kosovo to be turned into real acts so that they could build better and richer...

2. Sport - Olympics - IOC accepted/recognized Kosovo

3. Sport - Olympics - Kosovo in IOC, going to Rio 2016

4. Kosovo Elections - Results

5. Kosovo Status - EU wants dialog as soon as possible, waiting for Prisitina (article from when they didn't have government formed yet)

6. ""They'll ask us to recognize Kosovo"" (A quote by Serbian President used as article title focusing on his interview about talks with some EU officials)

7. (From February 2008 when Kosovo declared independence) - A meeting (not sure the correct word here, it's kinda like protest since there is a bunch of people on the street) named ""Kosovo is Serbia"" has been held.

8. Kosovo will ask for war damages and treasure? - Article about what's written in Kosovo press about them perhaps asking for war damages.

Ma famille n'est pas du tout juive, donc ça à fait un paquet de drames avec mon grand-père antisémite et sa famille séfarade traditionnelle, mais ils sont toujours ensemble et ont eu trois enfants qu'ils ont élevé loin de tout dogme, ni juif ni chrétien.

Pendant mon enfance, je savais qu'il était juif mais c'était pour moi un truc académique. Il n'est pas pratiquant et son judaïsme se limitait à quelques blagues de juif de temps en temps. Mais depuis un ou deux ans, il en parle un peu plus. Il ne pratique toujours pas, même si un de ses enfants s'est converti et est devenu très croyant. L'autre jour, pour le réveillon de noël familial, j'ai pu lui en parler et j'ai remarqué à quel point il avait été bouleversé par l'affaire Halimi. 

J'ai pas d'autres trucs à dire sur le sujet, sinon qu'au final, un homme qui se sent absolument pas membre d'une communauté revendiquée de plus en plus son appartenance à cause de ce que la communauté subit...

&gt; I can say both are wrong 

You seem to have conveniently missed out the part where the counterpart to the party you were criticizing did the same thing, possibly worse. That is called biasness. What makes Russia worse? Is it not illegal occupation of other countries? Why should we choose US over Russia if America and its proxies occupy/control other soverign nations? 

And you can keep the smugness to yourself. If you cant come up with key differences between Iraq/Ukraine, then say that instead of..ooo..might be a waste of time...ooo.


&gt;But again you're equating the deployment of defensive missile batteries to Russia invading another country.

I thought you wanted to teach me a thing or two. Apparently you cant seem to figure out the implications here. It might be a ""wasted effort"" but still worth a shot. 

By NATO expansion around Russia and positioning missile defense systems at Russia's doorsteps, NATO is using the strategy of [encirclement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encirclement). The idea is to keep a check on which missiles are allowed in and out of Russia. It makes Russia a sitting duck as they wont be able to launch missiles but ""freedom"" missiles would be able to fall wherever required.

Why did the US government shit its pants when Russia wanted to place its nukes in Cuba?

The world knows what US does when there is no one to counter its power. The brown people you love to bomb have had enough of your double standards i.e. create a terror outfit and punish the whole country for it. 

No matter how big your ego is, Russia is a significant country for the world. You cant steamroll them. You can bully smaller and weaker nations but I'm glad there's Russia. I would never want to live in Russia but neither would I want to live in the US.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; Sigh. The risk of hiring a person isn't does he or she cost too much at the point of hiring, but how much does that person cost later.

And bring later. It's all a cost/benefit relation for the company. And the benefit is so ridiculously oversized in modern societies they won't stop hiring. That's why ""startup"" who succeed have an explosive growth.

But, with the stock market acquiring companies, people begin being truly stupid : Share holders don't see anything beyond IMMEDIATE profit before reselling their share to make up some more money. So, they'll squeeze everyone of ONE MORE EURO even if that murder the company 2 years down the line. For example, by firing half the workers while the company is making record profits, to pocket their wages; and tell the other to ""just work twice as hard or you are fired too"". It's part of the reasons why firing people is made hard. To limit that kind of bullshit.

&gt; however demand may go down later

That's the risk the company has to shoulder in exchange for making money. It's part of the social contract. We don't expect companies to be rich because lulz we want to make somebody a billonaire and all slave for him. We pay companies money because we expect them to employ people. If you can't do that, we have little reason to tolerate your presence either. 

If you can't pay employees a living, we might as well have the state fund a robotized factory that build most needed goods and drive you in the ground by overselling you at lower profit-less prices.

&gt;  The risk of hiring especially in central and southern Europe is that it is highly costly and hard to fire any body.

Then why don't you go live there if it's so good ? Oh wait, because it's a (former, rising) third world area where everybody and their dog is getting fucked over by their employer on the wage part, and for some reason you don't feel like being a disguised slave like the hungarians either. And that's why THEY are implanting our western Europe regulation to become more like western Europe. Funny how things are ?

&gt;  employees will first try to find alternative ways to respond to a demand: increase of automation

Employers will try to get industrial non sentiant robots either way, because those don't need sleep, paid leave or unionise.

&gt; In Denmark the job market is highly dynamic, it is easy for companies to hire and fire, however because unemployment and social benefits are relatively high

Wages are high and so are taxes, and compensation. Which is what you most likely would not consider ""flexible"" and would have removed too. 

Except, that ""lack of flexibility"" is why the EU has one of the highest lifestyle in the world instead of being another african shithole.

&gt; This is what it is all about when we speak about too rigid work market.

Please stop thinking i'm that much of an idiot. It start there, then employers ask for no minimal wage ""for additionnal flexibility"", then to ban unions, then to make strikes illegal, to remove benefits, lower taxes (causing the welfare and healthcare system to crash), etc.

Those are the reason we live in the first world. So, the answer is simple really : NO.",null,0,null,1420283717,null,0,1420284304,0,cnd22bo,null,t3_2r47t6,null,t1_cnd22bo,null,t1_cnd082g,null,null,null,1425085244,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Die genannten Artikel sind der Trennung von Staat und Kirche aus der Religionsfreiheit (Art. 4) abgeleitet rangmäßig nachgeordnet und inhaltlich eine Verletzung der laizistischen Prinzips und außerdem ein Verstoß des Gleichheitsgrundsatzes. 

Denn wenn die Kirche Religionsunterricht in Schulen halten darf auf Kosten der Steuerzahler warum dann nicht Scientologen, Taoisten, Jedi-Druiden, Homeopathen.

Dies sind Relikte des Hitlerkonkordats, das 1933 der Kirche umfangreiche Bevorzugungen und Finanzierungen einräumte und nach dem 2.WK fast ungestört weiter Geltung genießt.

I am sorry, I understand your horrible situation, I too don't like austerity and don't like how much misery it bring to greece.

However saying greece never took money from Germany is stupid and wrong.

The reason for the current austerity measures was that Greeces was about to default on its debt and needed money, however the german tax payer felt that the greek government was at fault for their problems (which is kinda true but still its heartless to make the whole country suffer for that) and didn't want to just throw money into what they felt was a bottomless pit.

So then Merkel decided to implement austerity, because she felt that that would help the economic situation, AND because otherwise the german taxpayer wouldn't have allowed to ""waste"" money on the greeks.

I stated:

&gt; I am neither a member of the political elite, nor a representative of the totality of the country in which I happen to reside. I can say both are wrong and equally levee the same criticism I have against Russia.

I'm going to simplify the example in use of variables. While such an example does contain within it the underlying assumption of relational equation its use as an example will suffice, 

 * State *W* attacks state *Y*.

   * [Assuming false-pretense or otherwise unjustified pretense]...state *W* acted in the wrong.

      * Consideration of state *Y*'s positional, or retaliatory power in response.

 * State *X* attacks state *Z*.

   * [Assuming false-pretense or otherwise unjustified pretense]...state *X* acted in the wrong.

      * Consideration of state *Z*'s positional, or retaliatory power in response.


[In this example, as per the argument you set up equating the two -- with which I hold contention -- *W* is the United States and *X* is Russia; or vice versa]


I can deplore the actions of both *W* and *X*. Similarly *W* and *X* can, at a later date, engage in a conflict wherein one or the other is correct, leaving the other unjustified. 

--

This is why I stated: ""*I can say both are wrong and equally levee the same criticism I have against Russia.*"" In the current conflict Russia is in the wrong (invading Ukraine; aiding in the slaughter of hundreds of Europeans over Ukrainian air-space;...).

/u/Graypower 
&gt; What makes Russia worse?^*[1]* Is it not illegal occupation of other countries?^*[2]* Why should we choose US over Russia if America and its proxies occupy/control other soverign nations?^*[3]*

[Emphasis Added]

--

* [1]

   * Not the point. So while I do think Russia is worse that point is illusory. Previous transgressions do not necessitate contemporary, or historical, actions *can not* be right. They are to be judged on their own merits -- and in this case Russia is the aggressor. Violating treaties, killing their former countrymen, and invading a country within Europe.


* [2]

   * Again, illusory. Although I find it humorous you've tacitly admitted to Russia wrongfully invading another country, all while defending them. Bravo. 


* [3]

   * Who do you define as 'US Proxies'? You're evoking phrases similar to those used within the context of *The Cold War*. Russia no longer has a 'sphere of influence' outside of the puppet-states it has increasingly little control over directly outside their borders. So if by 'proxy' you mean 'influence' then you must realize you are comparing the totality of the European Union, NATO, Australia, Malaysia, Japan, and others to Russia and it's EEU.

  **Rhetoric of *The Cold War* | NATO, Expansion, &amp; Missiles**


&gt;By NATO expansion around Russia^*[1]* ...positioning [their] missile defense systems at Russia's doorsteps, NATO is using the strategy of encirclement^*[2]* ...It makes Russia a sitting duck as they wont be able to launch missiles but ""freedom"" missiles would be able to fall wherever required.^*[3]*

--

* [1]

   * Voluntary accession to an alliance, whose members are often reacting to Russia saber-rattling or outright aggression, can hardly be considered a strategy. NATO, and the EU, has made numerous attempts towards diplomacy -- even Russian accession -- but these acts of diplomacy were shot down: by Russia. 

* [2]

   * For a purported reason to be considered it must be both necessary and sufficient to, allegedly, reflect reality. Otherwise Occam would like to have a word with you. So, does the United States, NATO, or the EU *need* these missile systems or bases to encircle Russia? [No. No it doesn't.](https://i.imgur.com/U7uMW0i.jpg)


* [3]

   * Having defense systems makes Russia a sitting duck? What the bloody hell are you on about? Mull that over for a bit and get back to me.

&gt; Russia touts the few things its air-force can do well, why? Because it doesn't want you to realize the systemic failures hollowing out their real capability. The T-50/J-20/J-31 may do a few things well (although so far thats only on paper). On the other hand the F-22/35 can penetrate enemy lines, electronically jam their defenses, send back detailed infrastructure schematics (through sensor fusion -- basically we know where every piece of equipment is), and then eliminate targets at will.
&gt; 
&gt; Forget Russia, if the United States suddenly turned 'Hitlarian' the worlds armies couldn't stop it (Obviously it won't; just a comparison -- and assuming conventional warfare; nuclear weapons complicate things).

Essentially:

&gt; You're creating a false equivocation. I can, and do, actively denounce, lobby, and study the matters at hand. Check my post history you'll find I've frequently railed against the United States on multiple occasions -- I'm well aware of the countries short-comings. Likewise I'm aware of the short-comings of Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, China, Japan, Russia, Iraq, etc. I'd prefer it if Dick Cheney was in jail, or tried at the Hague. But most importantly I do not, and refuse to, falsely equivocate the actions of belligerents. Furthermore I recognize that even if such an equivocation exists the mere existence of previous transgressions does not make the wrongful actions of another nation any less wrong. I am not my country; instead I am, like you, a person.

Starting and running a company is quite hard. Yes, if you succeed on finding a sweat, then the company will grow easily, but if not, then it is daily struggle.

&gt; But, with the stock market acquiring companies, people begin being truly stupid : Share holders don't see anything beyond IMMEDIATE profit before reselling their share to make up some more money. So, they'll squeeze everyone of ONE MORE EURO even if that murder the company 2 years down the line.

Only a limited number of companies ever grow so big that they can list to the stock exchange. Most companies are small firms that employ 2-10 persons. For these companies every hire they make, can be a life or death decision. If they hire a wrong person, it can cost them dearly. 

&gt; That's the risk the company has to shoulder in exchange for making money. It's part of the social contract. We don't expect companies to be rich because lulz we want to make somebody a billonaire and all slave for him. We pay companies money because we expect them to employ people. If you can't do that, we have little reason to tolerate your presence either. 

We pay companies **to buy products and services**. If those products and services are in higher demand and customers have the ability to pay, company has bigger margins. We don't pay companies to employee people.

The problem that you don't seem to realize is that if companies have high costs on firing people, in a down turn, or during market change, companies will bleed money on having workers that they don't need. In a worst case scenario the bleeding is so bad that the whole company goes bankrupt. In a less worse case the company stays afloat, but can't restructure its business as it can't accumulate enough capital to make those changes. Both of these cases form a net loose to the economy.

For example I worked for a consulting company of 1000 people at its height. They had their luck change in the market and have had to downsize to around 300 persons. They are still alive because they could let go people that they didn't anymore need. If they wouldn't have been able to do so, or it would have cost too much, the company would have already gone bankrupt. So having that flexibility to fire people saves companies.

I myself jumped the ship from the company to another company that has tripled its revenue and tripled its employee count in the last 5 years, now being around 400. They are high growth company. But the only reason they could have that growth is because of lowered risks: our payment model is highly provision based, and in a really bad situation they can easily let people go.

&gt; Then why don't you go live there if it's so good ?
&gt; Wages are high and so are taxes, and compensation. Which is what you most likely would not consider ""flexible"" and would have removed too. 

I live in Finland, life is better hear than in central Europe. We have quite dynamic economy where hiring and firing people is relatively easy. Could be easier, but is manageable.

&gt; Employers will try to get industrial non sentiant robots either way, because those don't need sleep, paid leave or unionise.

The question from the point of view of society is, should it increase the rate of change or not. If you increase the speed of change, you will have more and more people that drop/are dropper out of society. With a slower speed of change, there would be less pressure for re-education and re-learning.

&gt; Please stop thinking i'm that much of an idiot. It start there, then employers ask for no minimal wage ""for additionnal flexibility"", then to ban unions, then to make strikes illegal, to remove benefits, lower taxes (causing the welfare and healthcare system to crash), etc.

Je connais la rhétorique par coeur et elle est fausse. Des femmes bourgeoises se plaignent, voilà l'effet que ça me fait.

&gt;une écrasante majorité de femmes dans les métiers du care et des services à la personne

Rien ne montre que ces phénomènes sont dus à la société. Si ça se trouve c'est biologique et on ne peut rien y faire. En Norvège les différences se sont aggravées dans les choix d'études depuis qu'ils ont mis en place des politiques de droits des femmes.

&gt;De Singly qui étudie la répartition des tâches ménagères dans le couple

Même chez les femmes célibataires et sans enfants le temps consacré au ménage est plus important que chez les hommes dans la même situation. Mon avis c'est que les exigences ménagères des femmes sont plus élevées que chez les hommes. En moyenne, les mecs se foutent un peu plus de la saleté et du désordre. Je ne vois pas en quoi c'est un problème. Si ça se trouve c'est biologique vu que nos besoins sont différents.

&gt;C'est comme le fait que les personnes en surpoids sont moins heureuses au travail, ou que les petits trouvent moins à se mettre en couple. C'est plus lié au rapport au corps en général qu'à l'aliénation due au travail

Oui si tu veux, mais c'est normal qu'on traite différemment des personnes aux physiques différents. Moi par exemple je suis petit, évidemment pour me mettre en position d'autorité ou pour draguer c'est plus compliqué. Pas besoin de crier à l'injustice, les gens sont inégaux, c'est comme ça. Ça permet de développer d'autres qualités, et d'adopter d'autres stratégies.

Yes, in theory. The reality is a bit more bleak though. The ability for the Irish government to raise the rate of corporation tax is in no means comparable to the ability of larger states like Germany to raise their respective rates of corporation tax.

Anyway, we're not in disagreement. I suppose the point I'm making is that I agree - GDP does tell us something - but what it tells us isn't all that important. If we had measures for GDP during the Industrial Revolution, everything would have been just fantastic according to the reductionist idiots you hear on the news today.

I primi stipendi me li sono tutti bruciati in cazzate del genere e se potessi tornare in dietro li userei per viaggiare.

Then you have the initial costs, which are the adoption or breeders fee (between 150€ and 1000€) plus equipement (scratching post, bowls, litter box, toys etc) and potentially vaccination and castration. If you keep the cat indoors you absolutely should get two (with the exception of old or sick lone wolfs), as they get bored to death otherwise (your furniture and your wall papers will thank you), so you have to multiply those costs by 2. With the expection of a very old or sick cat, I can guarantee that they will damage or even destroy things, especially in he first weeks, so you will have to pay for that too.

And then they still can get sick. Mine fortunatelly didn't yet, but just as an example: One of my guinea pigs, which one would think is tiny and hardly noticable financially got sick last year. The vet's bill added up to more than 600€, for such a tiny creature, and there wasn't any surgery or something like this involved. If surgery, intensive care and x-rays are needed, anticipate bills starting with 1000€ with a heavy upwards trend. Some get allergies or skin problems or lung problems and will require a special (expensive) diet.

Cats are wonderful creatures and I love mine to death, so I absolutely don't want to talk you out of that, just keep in mind that owning pets is a huge responsibility and I wish to no one to find oneself in the situation where you can't afford live-saving treatment for your beloved friend (or having to decide to give it away because you can't afford caring for it anymore etc.).",null,0,null,1420291065,null,0,false,0,cnd3fyk,null,t3_2r3zpr,null,t1_cnd3fyk,null,t1_cncm2a0,null,null,null,1425084600,null,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1,null

Tatsachenbehauptung.

&gt;Lügenpresse

Tatsachenbehauptung. Dein Problem?

Vermutlich bist du einer von denen, die nicht wissen, dass es sich bei der EU nicht um eine Demokratie handelt. Um eine solche zu etablieren sind 2 Dinge unabdingbar:

* 1. Gewaltenteilung

* 2. Gleiches Stimmgewicht jeder Stimme.

Die EU kennt die Gewaltenteilung nicht einmal auf dem Papier. Personen die in der Legislative der EU arbeiten, dort also Gesetze und Verordnungen beschließen, sind oft Mitglieder der Exekutive in den Mitgliedsstaaten, nämlich der dortigen Regierungen, die diese Verordnungen umzusetzen haben. 

Um das mal auf Deutschland zu übertragen: Man stelle sich vor die Bundesregierung beschließt ein Gesetz und setzt dieses dann auch selber durch. 

Weiterhin kann es sich nicht um eine Demokratie handeln, weil die Stimme eines Deutschen bei den Wahlen zum Europaparlament ein niedrigeres Stimmgewicht als bspw. die eines Maltesers hat. 

Auf Deutschland übertragen würde dies bedeuten, dass die Stimme eines Einwohners aus dem bevölkerungsreichsten Bundesland weniger zählt als die Stimme eines Einwohners aus dem bevölkerungsärmsten Bundesland. 

Beides Dinge die besonders in faschistischen Systemen anzutreffen sind. Kombiniert mit der neoliberalen Ideologie die hinter der EU steht und die den Völkern der Mitgliedsländer aufgedrängt wird, sowie der offenen Unterstützung faschistischer Regime wie bspw. in Kiew, kann man durchaus von Neofaschismus sprechen. Der Nationalismus welchem die EU frönt ist nämlich der eigene. Die demokratischen Parlamente werden zugunsten dieser neuen Nation mit ihrer extrem nationalistischen Grundhaltung ""EU zuerst, dann die Mitgliedsstaaten"" aufgelöst bzw. unterwandert. Auch ist die EU nach dem Führerprinzip aufgebaut. Das EU Parlament ist entmachtet und weitgehend aller demokratischen Rechte(bspw. Initiativrecht) beraubt, die Entscheidungen werden wie in anderen faschistischen Systemen durch Kommissare getroffen, die unter der Leitung eines Führers stehen(derzeit Juncker). Dieser neue Faschismus in der EU erfüllt auch alle anderen Merkmale faschistischer Regime. Antiliberal, antidemokratisch, elitenorientiert, ignorieren der Mehrheitsmeinung, Ausbau zugunsten weniger.

Klassischer Faschismus neu gedacht. Neofaschismus eben.

Zur Lügenpresse: 

Die Medien in Deutschland sind gleichgeschaltet. Freiwillig. Sie alle sind angewiesen auf folgende Faktoren angewiesen um als profitorientierte Unternehmen zu bestehen.

* 1. Newsproduzenten
Besonders die Politik gehört zu diesen. Wer im Kanzlerjet mitfliegen will, wer die Wirtschaftsdelegationen der Regierung begleiten will, wer Vorabinformationen aus dem Parlament oder der Partei will, wer embedded als erster von der Front berichten will, der wird sich den Newsproduzenten als Nutte andienen müssen. Kritiker sitzen dort nicht, so weit schaffen es nur die Hofberichterstatter, die sich im Gegenzug prestigeträchtig Qualitätsmedien nennen dürfen.

So kommt dann eben eine Ukraineberichterstattung zustande, welche die Aktuelle Kamera der DDR in den Schatten stellt.


* 2. Anzeigenkunden/Investoren

Hinter jedem Medienkonglomerat stehen Wirtschaftsinteressen. Kaum ein Medienunternehmen ist frei in seiner Berichterstattung, da die wirtschaftlichen Interessen der (Anteils-)Eigner und der Anzeigenkunden im Vordergrund eines profitorientierten Unternehmens stehen. Schaltet also BMW Anzeigen für viele Millionen Euro und lobbyiert über die Bundesregierung gleichzeitig für ein Abschwächen der Abgasnormen in Brüssel, wird die Lügenpresse einen Dreck tun da hochkritisch Stellung zu beziehen und auch wegen dem ersten Punkt nicht anfangen investigativ der Korruption in der Regierung nachzugehen.

* 3. Leser

Der Masse der gebildeten und gutverdienenden Leser kann man den Schund der unter Beachtung von 1 und 2 als Journalismus verkauft wird nicht andrehen. Dementsprechend müssen die Dummen vornehmlich mit Inhalten versorgt werden. Also kommt es zu der massiven Hetze gegen Ausländer, Flüchtlinge, Hartz4-Empfänger. Zumeist gelogen(siehe Zwang zu mohammedanischen Weihnachtsliedern), übertrieben, sensationalisiert und immer das Volk auseinanderdividierend. Dass an vielen Zuständen das System schuld ist, welchem man aufgrund des ersten Punktes her dient oder die Eliten, welchen man aufgrund des zweiten Punktes verpflichtet ist, bleibt wie immer außen vor. Verschweigen, verdunkeln, nur kleinere Skandale aufdecken.

Man sieht, Lügenpresse.

Die Verschwörungstheorie wäre zu sagen, dass bei den Verlagen das rote Telefon klingelt und dort dann der amerikanische Präsident den genauen Wortlaut der nächsten Meldung diktiert. Das ist natürlich Quatsch. Kontrolle funktioniert heute informell, Druck wird wirtschaftlich auf Redaktionen ausgeübt, missliebige Personen werden nach Bedarf getauscht.

Es wird ja auch den Demonstranten immer so ein Unsinn vorgeworfen, als ob die wirklich glaubten dies liefe so wie im James Bond Film ab.

Hallo Du Pegida. Du musst versstehen, dass es, außer bei Pegida-Wut-Bürgern, kaum jemanden gibt, der ein ""Fuck-Nazis"" für polarisierend hält. Die Ablehnung von Nazis ist, insbesondere hier in Deutschland, gesellschaftlicher Allgemeinplatz. Indem Pegida diesen ablehnt, stellt sich Pegida gegen die Gesellschaft. 

Einziges ""polarisierendes Accessoir"" ist die Flagge des Staates Israel. Und zwar deshalb, weil sie polarisierend ist. Der Nahost-Konflikt wird, auch wieder aufgrund der deutschen Geschichte, gerade hier immer wieder sehr heftig diskutiert.

&gt;Noms de personnes

&gt;Quand on ne s'adresse pas à la personne, pas de majuscule au titre.

&gt;&gt;le président de l'université de Lausanne, le professeur Tournesol, le maréchal Joukov, le docteur Max Hilaire, l'abbé Pierre, mademoiselle Cunégonde, le président Mao, le roi Dagobert, le maire de Montcuq

&gt;Dans la correspondance, les titres de celui ou celle à qui l'on s'adresse prennent habituellement la majuscule. Ainsi, si l'on écrit au président du club de boules de Garchizy, il est de bon ton de commencer sa missive par Monsieur le Président et l'on écrira pour finir Je vous prie d'agréer, Monsieur le Président, etc. C'est ce qu'on appelle la ""majuscule de courtoisie"".

&gt;Mais les conventions d'utilisation de la majuscule dans les titres ne sont pas homogènes.

&gt;&gt;– le Général (pour désigner, p. ex., de Gaulle), le Maréchal (pour désigner, p. ex., Pétain à une certaine époque : Maréchal, nous voilà...), mais : le pape (pourtant unique !, la majuscule est aussi possible), le roi (même chose) ;

&gt;&gt;– le ministre de l'Intérieur, mais : le Premier ministre (on peut expliquer la majuscule par un souci de désambiguïsation : le Premier ministre ne doit pas être confondu avec un premier ministre (p. ex. le premier ministre de la Culture de la Ve République), mais pourquoi pas de majuscule à ministre ? ;

&gt;&gt;– le président de la République ou le Président de la République (très fréquent dans les textes officiels ; pensez ! un président de la République sans majuscule alors que le Premier ministre y a droit, lui...).

&gt;De fait, l'utilisation de la majuscule obéit ici partiellement à un autre principe, lié à des préséances et à des conventions sociales établies. Plus on s'élève dans la hiérarchie, plus on emploie la majuscule. Selon Grevisse (Le bon usage), trois personnes au moins ont droit, en toutes circonstances, à la majuscule initiale pour leurs titres honorifiques : Son Excellence, Son Altesse et Sa Sainteté... (mais pas, en principe, pour le nom de leur fonction : Son Excellence le consul de Poldévie, Son Altesse le roi Ottokar IV). Le Général, celui qui a fait un discours un certain 18 juin, a droit à la majuscule, mais pas le gardien (même si je désigne ainsi spécifiquement celui de mon immeuble) ni le facteur (le mien).",null,0,null,1420293929,null,0,false,0,cnd43ry,null,t3_2r6ntx,null,t1_cnd43ry,null,t1_cnd1xlu,null,null,null,1425084292,null,6,false,france,t5_2qhjz,6,null

Because employees don't strugle either when they put 10h work day 5 or 6 day a week for 1000€/mo then get fired at random ""because there isn't work anymore for you"" ?

&gt; Only a limited number of companies ever grow so big that they can list to the stock exchange.

Yes, then they absorb every single other, and dominate your entire life. You school in samsung, live in a samsung corporate flat, go to the samsung museum of technology, enjoy samsung sponsored hobbits, work at samsung's, ...

Then one day it's not the nice Samsung but the assholes from Comcast, and there is no running Comcast water in your Comcast home 90% of the time because you are too poor to afford it on your comcast wage (while the CEO goes to his private beach in helicopter daily).

It's called mega corporatism. And it's why we have to put limits.

&gt;  For these companies every hire they make, can be a life or death decision

If you can't make a business without slaves, you might has well not have a business at all.

&gt; If they hire a wrong person, it can cost them dearly

That's part of the job dear. Cost of business. That's why company make money on such bets.

&gt; We pay companies to buy products and services

Nah that's bullshit, i can have the same manufactured by the state at a loss, as the giant public sector in the EU proved it.

&gt; We don't pay companies to employee people.

Yes you do, that's why companies still exist. That and to fill up the massive blanks the state can't think about or handle. Helping redistribute ressources where needed properly. And that include wage money.

&gt; companies will bleed money on having workers that they don't need

Cost of business. When you are millionaire, you don't have a right to complain about the wage of your employees making less than 1/10 of you being too high, period.


&gt; In a worst case scenario the bleeding is so bad that the whole company goes bankrupt.

That happends. You bet, sometime you win, sometime you loose. What you want is ""when i win i win all the money, when i loose the citizens loose everything -tax money, jobs, ...- and i don't loose anything"".

Sorry, no can do.

&gt; Both of these cases form a net loose to the economy

Maybe. A small one. However, having some employers and corporation accumulating the entire currency in existence and having their workers incapable of paying anything *IS* a *CATASTROPHIC loss* for *hundreds of million that can't pay the monthly bills anymore*.

The EU doesn't exist just to make a few people rich. It exist to enable a decent and modern (as much as humanely possible.) lifestyle for hundreds of millions. And if you think it's just here to line up your pockets like in the USA where people are throw away minions, for all i care you can go f**k yourself.

&gt; They had their luck change in the market and have had to downsize to around 300 persons.

And, last i heard you could still fire people for largescale economic troubles. But you have to put forms in it, with indemnities and such. Which means you can do it but certainly not on a whime, because doing it constantly WILL burn your bank account to no end. so, that company can still go to 300. However, try to do it every 6 months and yeah 2 years down the line you fill in bankruptcy. It's the whole point.

&gt; So having that flexibility to fire people saves companies.

Or enable you to do it every 6 months, make 700 people throw away and destroy their lives just so that your company can save a bit more cash. Yup, if i have a say it's not going to happen.

&gt; But the only reason they could have that growth is because of lowered risks: our payment model is highly provision based, and in a really bad situation they can easily let people go.

Or, because you got lucky/made a good educated guess and won the bet. Again, if you can't handle risk, you might want to recycle into doing something else because obviously you aren't suited to do your job properly.

&gt;  We have quite dynamic economy where hiring and firing people is relatively easy.

When you respect the proper way to do it, yes. And respect implied minimal wages and union rights and striker. 

I heard it was a bad idea to abuse employees and fuck over unions to ""enforce flexibility"" like some would dream to do it. Unless you don't want anyone to pick up your trash anymore and all your mail to be accidentally lost.

&gt; but is manageable.

See. The issue is those southern states are already A LOT below scandinavian society on that side. So when people want employees to be ""more flexible"", they really mean ""throw away people like in Africa"".

&gt; Because they are dynamic economies

With very strong workers rights and protection. Exactly what ""market flexibility"" advocate wants to suppress.


Say, tomorrow Finland becomes ""more flexible"" because economic crisis, and your boss hire you one month every three months (when he  immediately needs you and give you all your 3 months work that month), fire you the others two months and cut 10% your wage on your working month to be ""more competitive"", and just tell you to ""just find something for the rest of the time"" and the rest is all partial time job with unpickable odd schedule (E.G: 10 days at 12h long shift then one week out) and where you can't walk out and walk back in either for 14€/hour at 2h of commuting from your home ; then your company pay lower taxes so the healthcare stop covering a lot of things to compensate and not bankrupt. Then one day you break your leg on your way to work, need immediate costly surgery and the insurance doesn't pay anything, US style. You fill in bankruptcy, and everything you own is taken away to pay said hospital bill.

Wouldn't you feel a bit in total shit ?

Because, that's what the US do when they advocate ""flexibility"". And what they want to implant there.

null,false,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,null,"High levels of debt and a large deficit mean that creditors find it unlikely they'll be paid back, so they want higher interest rates in return for lending to factor in the risk that it might happen. This makes borrowing much more expensive, and so where at 2% the government would have gotten more benefit than cost out of the borrowing, at 7% the opposite is true. Since they would get less benefit by borrowing at high rates than by cutting the deficit, they cut the deficit. 

Except the problem is the government already owes a ton of money, and it was hoping to finance the bonds that are maturing with a new bond issue - but these bonds would be at much higher rates because of the fear creditors have that the government will not be able to pay it back. Now the government is soon coming up to the bond maturity date and needs financing to pay it back, so it has to go to other creditors (generally last resort ones) like the IMF. But these aren't going to lend willy-nilly, they want assurances they won't have to fund the government for eternity so they attach conditions they believe will make the governments future bond issues more attractive to creditors so that Greece doesn't have to go to the Troika for borrowing in the future.

These measures mean cutting the budget deficit, either by increased revenue or decreased spending. With a low and stable budget deficit, international creditors are likely to see more hope that they will not be burned by the country breaking its commitments when they issues the bonds by defaulting. Greece has been doing this, and as a consequences it's rates have plummeted compared to the past. Austerity has been working, though some of the measures demanded by the troika in return for further funding have been more harmful than beneficial, something they have admitted.

null,false,Merion,BADE,Baden,null,"The lowest number of ""erstanträge"" of asylum seekers were in 2007 with 19.164. Since then the number has been steadily climbing. In 2012 there were already more than trice the number of asylum seekers numbering 64.539. So yes, the number for 2014 was exceptionally high, but the numbers have been climbing. 2014 was the first year the numbers of asylum seekers did not go down for the winter months but continued to rise.


Also, it's not just the asylum seekers who come into play when you get to the feeling of ""Islamisierung"". The asylum seekers, even with the rising numbers, are a smalll percentage of all the people immigrating to Germany each year. In 2013, I can't find the numbers for 2014 yet, there were more than 1 million people moving to Germany. Yes, the net migration was lower, about 437.000, but still, you have to integrate all the people who are coming while those leaving probably were it least partly integrated.

With quotas people want to spread the number of asylum seekers more evenly and fairly across the whole of Europe. It wouldn't mean that they don't get humanitarian aid. The background to that is the following:
In the first half year of 2014 more than 230.000 people came to Europe. 74.885 went to Germany. Great Britain took 14.685 people. Spain took 2.165 people. 
Now, nobody is going to deny, that Germany is the most populous and the richest country in Europe, so, of course, it gets more. But even if you take into account only the GDP, Germany's part would only be 50.082, taking into account only the population, the part would only be 38.665 people. On the other hand, GB would have to take more than 30.000 people and Spain would have to take more than 18.000.

So what PEGIDA wants is that every country in Europe is obligated to take in asylum seekers according to their GDP or their population or both. It would distribute the load more evenly.

As far as I know, the PEGIDA wrote in its position paper that giving people asylum was a ""Menschenpflicht"", a human duty. They don't want to stop letting people in, but were talking about decentralizing the housing instead of putting them in homes for asylum seekers. They were talking about increasing the number of people who are responsible for the care of the asylum seekers and they were talking about shortening the time it takes to decide if somebody is granted asylum.

By the way, your numbers about Muslims in Germany might be off. Yes, there are only about 2% German Muslims in Germany, but taking into account all the Muslims in Germany, there are more like 4-5%. But you are right, that the number is often overestimated. One reason for that could be, that they often live in cities and the seen percentage there is a lot higher.

One thing that might contribute to the feeling of ""Islamisierung"" is, that there is some kind of anticipatory obedience. Your company doesn't celebrate Christmas anymore, it has to be a end of year celebration. You don't celebrate Sankt Martin, you get a festival of lights. I've heard of renaming some of the traditional Christmas markets into Winter markets. 

Now, so far I haven't gotten to know a single muslim who went and asked for that. But people, all the more, if they don't know any muslims, feel threatened by that, because they feel that they lose some parts of the German identity.

I think, you are not really helping the situation if you are putting the Pegida in the category dumb, right nazis. I think, most of them are actually not. They are mostly unsettled, insecure and concerned. Talk to them and don't dismiss everthing they say just because they said it. In fact, some of the things they have said about asylum, are good suggestions that might really help the people who are coming to Germany. Maybe the people who wrote that, didn't really mean to help them, but that doesn't mean that you can't take it and do something good with it.",null,0,null,1420295943,null,0,1420298439,0,cnd4mod,null,t3_2r3vac,null,t1_cnd4mod,null,t1_cncst4d,null,null,null,1425084048,null,8,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,8,null

Però se il fisco funziona così, bisogna seguirlo. Punto.

Se hai un piano finanziario che ti permette di andare in perdita, perfetto, altrimenti non apri l'attività. Fa schifo? Sì, certo, ma tant'è. Non puoi aprire un'attività e dopo un anno al momento di pagare le tasse decidi di non farlo perché ti accorgi di non potertelo permettere... bisognerebbe smettere di improvvisarsi imprenditori.

* Point One:

What you're describing is a debt spiral. Unfortunately, even with the low interest rates of the bailout loans and the budget cuts, Greece is still in a debt spiral, with its debt increasing and impossible to pay back. 

It's funny how you think that when the Greek government was doing this on its own it was somehow unsustainable, but now that it's continuing to do the exact same thing (albeit at a lower pace) it's somehow reasonable. 

* Point Two:

You're describing the debtor countries as individually responsible for their situation and the creditor countries as saviours who are there only to help from the goodness of their hearts. The reality is that in a monetary union there are no individual debts and there are no individual countries all independent from each other. 

* Point Three:

There is no magical fix, sure. Did I say there was? Your eagerness to present your opponent as a populist is a sign of poverty of arguments. The thing is, at the moment Greece is not digging itself out. It's still digging itself into a hole. Your refusal to acknowledge this is disingenuous to say the least. 

* Point Four:

You think that you can summarise all there is to be said about the Eurozone crisis in 4 paragraphs and somehow that is convincing. It's not. You think that by mentioning over-indebtedness and a country being shut out of the bond markets you have described the whole problem. You haven't. You think that when a country is shut out of the bond markets the only course of action available is to borrow some more. It's not.

Well, yes consistent is right. It wasn't a unified conscious policy but rather the consequence of consistent British interests on the continent. Splendid isolation is just an articulated version of the policy for a specific period.

&gt;aligned with the interests of Poland and France in WWII then why on earth would Britain seek a rapprochement with Germany? Further why would they allow German expansion into Austria and Czechoslovakia when this clearly gave Germany a massive advantage against France?

At the time, it was believed Versailles was unduly harsh and had left Germany weaker than a three-legged kitten. It wasn't obvious that Germany could overtake the French military so quickly.

&gt;Thirdly and finally the notion that Britain's entry into WWII was in some way a calculated move runs contrary to Britain's actual entrance. Britain's preparations for WWII were so half-hearted and shambolic that it is hard to imagine any great political or national lay behind it.

There is no EU law stating limits for any sort of government aid. Any aid you may receive from the government of your residence depends on local law. This means the requirements, time, and form of dispensation differ from state to state.

JSA is honestly a horrible system, filled with soul numbing hoops.

True. 

But if only one side gets many arms, and the other side is weak and defenseless, then you can be 100% sure that there will be a war (learn from history). Because that's like leaving the bank vault open for any bad person to walk in and grab the riches.

First of all, the word ""austerity"" is itself populist doublespeak, which is very convenient for those who wish to vilify a management policy while avoiding to discuss its merits.  

The reason is clear: if a state is running a 12% deficit and is bankrupt, it's hard to argue against spending cuts and claim they aren't needed, or argue that the policies that lead to that disaster didn't had disastrous consequences.

Once the doublespeak kicks in and you replace any reference to spending cuts with an euphemism like ""austerity"", critics can make all sorts of wild claims such as, say, the need to cut spending on a state with a 12% deficit can only be justified through conspiracy theories.

That's why the only argument that is made against the pressing need some states have to balance the budget and stop ramping up sovereign debt are these vague, baseless populist tautologies that if a government runs a 12% deficit then austerity is bad because it is bad, therefore if austerity is bad then it should be stopped because it's bad, and only bad people support something that this is so bad.

null,false,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,null,"On point one, Greece recently posted a primary budget surplus (after having 10%+ primary deficits in the past). The measures taken have been arresting the debt spiral. It is up to the Greek government to find more ways to balance their budget so that they can achieve a fiscal surplus, leading to lower borrowing rates, and the ability to pay down some debt so they have some breathing space.

&gt;The reality is that in a monetary union there are no individual debts and there are no individual countries all independent from each other.

Of course there are individual debts. I don't know why you're saying this, the consequences of Greece defaulting do not reflect on the other countries (except for the marginal pressure creditors may be able to impose on other eurozone economies to try and get them to pressure Greece into paying back some defaulted debt). The other solutions you proposed in another post elsewhere in this submission are structural changes that would require treaty change and the unanimous consent of those countries. Those solutions basically burn away any 'firewall' between one countries debt and another, and represent costs to countries that managed their finances responsibly to help out those countries that didn't. They ignore that the EU is not a single state, it is a mechanism by which multiple states can cooperate in some areas, and retain sovereignty in others - and you want other countries to give up that sovereignty because Greece fucked up. There are a number of articles in that list that are purple links for me. 

I haven't tried to explain the whole 'crisis' in these four paragraphs. I tried to give a brief overview of the system, and how Greece has fucked up within that system. Creditors are the key uncontrollable factor in any solution to Greece's woes, and Greece just needs to continue trying to fix their perception of Greece. 

&gt;There is no magical fix, sure. Did I say there was? Your eagerness to present your opponent as a populist is a sign of poverty of arguments.

Actually, the basis behind my 'magic fix' comment is that people don't realise that some solutions take time to fix (years, even), and hence decry austerity as not working, not that opposition to austerity in itself was populist.

Go into debt.  There's no way around it.  They can't create more euros out of thin air.  And even if they do become more competitive, some other country must then necessarily lose out.  

Even if you are a very competitive state, and are successful in extracting every last available penny from uncompetitive states, eventually you reach a point where your own exports no longer have a market, as those uncompetitive states simply can't afford to buy your goods anymore.  What happens then?  Well, then we get what's happening right now in Germany -- its growth forecasts collapsing, its consumer confidence fading, its manufacturing outlook falling.

This is a strawman.  

The problem that is affecting states such as Greece is not only the over-indebtedness but also a huge structural deficit that forces the government to depend on piling up even more sovereign debt to be able to cover the expenditure.

...which, mind you, Greece's governments tried to hide by cooking the books.

Let's look at Sweden's example: some years ago it had a huge debt, reaching around 90% its GDP, but through spending cuts, controlling the structural deficit and a responsible government it already paid off nearly half its sovereign debt and even manages to run budget surplus. 

For this to happen, Sweden's governments had to cut spending, control their structural deficit, and enact reforms.

This is what's expected from Greece, but somehow there's this intransigent and entirely baseless opinion that no greek government has the balls to do what's right, because somehow others need to foot the bill.

No matter how much people refuse to talk straight and resort to using doublespeak labels such as ""austerity"" to avoid touching the real problems, this won't change even if the entire world lines up to pay Greece's debt in full.",null,0,null,1420299504,null,0,false,0,cnd5qcy,null,t3_2r70cn,null,t1_cnd5qcy,null,t1_cnd4d1w,null,null,null,1425083533,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

null,false,Naurgul,null,null,null,"&gt; On point one, Greece recently posted a primary budget surplus (after having 10%+ primary deficits in the past). The measures taken have been arresting the debt spiral.

But the surplus might be a product of lying about stats, not to mention a primary surplus is not a budget surplus. The budget deficit is still at ~10%

&gt; It is up to the Greek government to find more ways to balance their budget so that they can achieve a fiscal surplus, leading to lower borrowing rates, and the ability to pay down some debt so they have some breathing space.

I guess closing a few more schools and hospitals will do it. Then Greece can look forward to getting to its 2009 levels of debt in the next 30 years (I wish that was exaggeration). 

&gt; I don't know why you're saying this [...] They ignore that the EU is not a single state, it is a mechanism by which multiple states can cooperate in some areas, and retain sovereignty in others

Because a monetary union implies a higher level of interdependence. Like a family all living under the same roof, it's difficult to assign blame to individual countries. When you have the same currency, the lines are blurred and you can't say that it's ""just independent countries cooperating with each other"". 

&gt; The other solutions you proposed in another post elsewhere in this submission are structural changes that would require treaty change and the unanimous consent of those countries.

Not all of them. For some, yes, for others no. 

&gt;  Those solutions basically burn away any 'firewall' between one countries debt and another, and represent costs to countries that managed their finances responsibly to help out those countries that didn't.

Il termine per iscriversi alle liste era il 27 dicembre, a quel punto non essendosi iscritto un numero sufficiente, sono stati chiamati in servizio per garantire l´ordine pubblico.

Je me rappelle, du temps où j'avais un stage obligatoire à faire, participer (enfin, assister) à une réunion où il fallait expliquer à un maire et son équipe qu'établir une zone d'activité sur sa commune c'était non seulement inutile mais que ça allait en plus plomber le budget de la commune sans résultats probants. Je me rappelle plus exactement des chiffres mais on allait allègrement sur une estimation de 5 à 10 ans pour que la taxe pro rembourse les investissements routiers, et je te passe les nouveaux services à développer en mairie, les écoles pour les enfants des employés et habitants supplémentaires que ça attirerait, les coûts en termes de réseau d'eau, et évidemment, sans compter les dépenses de santé, de conduites de gaz, de réseaux ERDF, d'administration, de services sociaux pour les employés, de subventions pour les nouvelles entreprises, de formation, de services aux employeurs (genre pole emploi) puisque tout ça, c'est pour l'état et ça n'entrait évidemment pas dans le rapport.

Le pauvre maire, qui était un sympathique petit instit à la retraite, n'avait que les termes ""développer l'activité"" à la bouche et croyait faire oeuvre utile pour la collectivité, alors qu'il aurait juste foutu sa commune dans une merde pas possible. On pense souvent à développer l'activité sans réfléchir à la nécessité d'une telle chose, sans penser à l'efficacité économique d'une telle décision, et en ignorant totalement les coûts que ça induit.

Je suis conscient que c'est assez obscur pour un non initié mais une entreprise c'est d'abord un coût pour la collectivité, qui souvent ne s'y retrouve pas (surtout au niveau local). C'est d'ailleurs pour ça que les entreprises s'installent en france plutôt qu'en Ouganda par exemple, où elles n'ont accès à rien et doivent tout payer si jamais elles veulent s'implanter, ce en dépit d'un coût de la main d'oeuvre très inférieur.

In your introduction you write of a 5 hour trip Cologne - Zürich, and in a reply of 6 hours. 

5 hours is possible only with an ICE via the high-speed line Cologne - Frankfurt-Airport, and involves at least one change. But there are also two direct IC trains (loco hauled) via the Rhine valley (Bonn, Koblenz, Mainz (Mayence), etc) which take six hours. 

Maybe the previous train had a problem, and loaded its passengers on your train, or you travelled on a friday which is the most busy day on the long distance trains (weekly commuters), or on the main return day after the Xmas holidays, or what ever. 

Without knowing that, I can only express my sympathies and mention that I rarely run into problems that you describe. 

It is also not clear to me what actually went wrong with your seat reservation (which is optional on those German trains, except for sleepers and the so called ""Sprinter"" trains, going non-stop over longer distances). You write that you had been warned by the booking website that the Family/small child compartment may possibly not available on the train, but then went ahead without sucess.

Taking refugees is nice and all, I think we have an obligation to help. But we have to be pragmatic. The fact of the matter is that every country can only take in so many people over x years. More people = more strain on infrastructure, demand for housing, public money and jobs. 

That and large ghettos drawn on ethnic/religious/language lines that result from high migration seem to inhibit integration and raise tension. A migrant has no incentive to learn English if they go months without needing to use it because everyone around them speaks Arabic.

Wer sich mal ein bisschen mit dem beschäftigt hat, kommt schnell dahinter, dass der nicht viel von Wissenschaft hielt. Wie es ein ""guter"" Soziologe eben tun sollte. Er gibt seine Meinung zum besten. Schafft Begriffe um seine Sicht der Gesellschaft zu erklären. Dass diese Theorien völlig subjektiv sind, dass diese nur Teilaspekte der heutigen Gesellschaft erklärt, dass es an diesen massive Kritik gibt, all das störte ihn als Soziologen nicht. Ähnlich wie Bordieu, Luhmann oder Foucault.

Alles Soziologenpack welches die Welt(oder eben Aspekte dieser) ihrer Meinung nach erklärt, aber wichtige Aspekte auslässt. Das hat nichts mit Wissenschaft zu tun, das ist Ratewerk. Das Problem ist allerdings, dass Soziologen meinen ihre Meinung habe ein Gewicht. Dies gilt auch für die Anhängerschaft dieser Labertaschen. All diejenigen welche deren Argumentation übernehmen und einen auf gebildet machen wollen, rasseln immer komplett gegen die Wand sobald gefordert wird diese Thesen wissenschaftlich zu überprüfen. 

Hier scheiterte auch Ulrich Beck. Dieser wurde besonders gelobt und zitiert, weil er eben auch EU-Apologet und indoktrinatorisch tätig war. Der trennte seine private Meinung nie von dem was er als ""Wissenschaftler"" äußerte, sehr zur Freude derer die immer mehr und mehr EU propagierten. Überhaupt nicht dem Anspruch Webers entsprechend Tatsachen und Werturteile zu trennen.

So etwas lieben ja auch Universitäten, an denen EU oder Tod gelehrt wird, die sind ideologisch genau so verblendet wie damals als es hieß Drittes Reich oder Untergang.

Deshalb kritisiere ich diese Pseudowissenschaft auch so. Sie dient der Rechtfertigung all dessen, was uns damals unterjocht hat, heute ins Elend treibt und auch in Zukunft dafür sorgt, dass wir zivilisatorisch nicht vorwärts kommen. Wir nennen es nur anders, wir nutzen andere Methoden, letztendlich unterdrücken wir aber wie eh und je.

Jeder der die Werke eines Soziologen liest und nicht sofort denkt ""Das ist der größte Schwachsinn den ich heute gelesen habe,"" der macht etwas falsch. Die Soziologie ist Meinung statt Wissenschaft, erklärt nichts, determiniert nichts, bringt nichts. Das ist wie Philosophie, Meinungen wie Arschlöcher. 

Von den Utopisten unter diesen Irren will ich gar nicht erst anfangen, jemand der sich anmaßt zu wissen wie die Welt richtig funktionieren müsste, kann man getrost als saudumm bezeichnen.

It's not a case of *reductio at hitlerum* here. His point is not the cruelty of Nazis towards the Jews during the WWII but rather the fact that most of the international legislation regarding refugees is a consequence of mistakes made before and during the WWII by European democracies. By the Convention of Geneva, and later with the 1951 UN Convention on the status of refugees, Occidental regimes tried to learn from the past, by setting up an institutional system protecting refugees. It was actually a priority back then, when the flows of refugees from Communist countries were growing endlessly.

He took the case of the Jews, because it's the worst one, but he could've taken the case of Spanish refugees in France, fleeing the Civil war. Instead of welcoming them, to protect them, the French government of the republican Daladier put them in concentration camps along the French/Spanish borders.

&gt; It's dogmatic reasoning, certainly not worthy of something that calls itself a philosopher.

Therefore, obviously any miraculous anti-capitalist silver bullets, such as appeals to blindly refuse to pay any debt, actually fail to solve any problem, because the underlying cause of all these problems will remain there.

If you want to keep tabs on users and tag people you suspect install [Reddit enhancement suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) it will keep a cumulative total of all up-votes and downvotes you give a specific user, after I notice I have given a certain user over 30 or so downvotes I usually look into their post history to see why I disagree so much, 

9/10 times they are frequent defenders of US foreign policy and average about 50 - 100 comments daily. way, way more then the scope of what I would call a hobby user. 

The same people usually also spend their time defending the likes of monsanto, TTP/TTIP and always have bad things to say about the likes of Glen Greanwald/Snowden etc however I suspect they most likely work for a PR company than directly for the US government but my fun experiment makes reddit browsing that bit more interesting anyway and of course this is just my opinion.

Tout se passait bien, on est allé au cinéma ensemble ( Interstellar ce film est dingue, puis le hobbit 3).  
On devait passer le 31 tout les deux chez elles mais ses parents ont décidé de rester sur Paris à cause de la neige et de reporter leur retour dans le sud.  Elle me propose que de passer le week end chez elle, ce que j'ai accepté, là à cette heure ci je devrais être chez elle mais comme d'habitude je n'ai pas de chance elle a eu une embrouille avec son ex, une relation de 4ans du coup pas de week end chez elle. Je lui ai donc proposer un resto coréen à 19h. Elle avait dit okay hier soir mais maintenant elle m'a envoyé ""je ne sais pas encore je te dis après"".  Et d'après mon expérience quand on me dit ça, ça veut dire non.
Je n'arrive pas à penser à autre chose. Que faire pour lui montrer que ""hé ho je suis la pour toi"" ?
Je pense que j'ai ma chance car elle a accepté de se déplacer après le boulot alors que le cinéma se trouvait à l'autre bout de Paris et qu'en se rendant au métro pour rentrer elle a préféré qu'on marche à la prochaine station pour qu'on discute un peu plus longtemps je suppose.

Define a ""defensive"" air force. A Cessna with a guy sitting in the back holding an MANPAD can actually be just as lethal as a fighter plane - and harder to track down because modern antiaircraft systems on fighter jets are not designed for very slow planes (actually, we were unable to down a sailplane over Frankfurt in '02 or so).

&gt; somewhat relevant, the route and the interceptions done to those russian bombers they sent down to the Portuguese coast

It was my impression that the Russian bombers never actually got close to Portugese airspace, always staying in international space... And you only can go near Portugal over the Shetland/Ireland route if you want to avoid getting international law involved.
