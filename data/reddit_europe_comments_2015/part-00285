null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; Why isn't there an English wiki for this guy?

I don't know. There is German though. Maybe cause he was Yugoslavian. If he was American I bet we would all know about him and would watch a third re-boot of a movie franchise about him. XD

&gt;  Also for Draža Mihajlović, wasn't he head of the Chetnik organization at the time?

First he was a General of Yugoslavian Royal army. Then When the war started he and the Royal army were the only resistance movement in Yugoslavia. The USA and UK viewed him as the ally in this region and he was even awarded [The Medal of Merit from the USA president Harry S. Truman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dra%C5%BEa_Mihailovi%C4%87#/media/File:Dra%C5%BEaLegion_of_Merit.jpg). And was also depicted [in Nazi propaganda as a ""Jewish puppet"".](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Dra%C5%BEa_Mihailovi%C4%87_propaganda_poster.jpg)

Now this is very important to know about the Chetnik movement: it  wasn't a centralized and homogeneous movement. [There were even Slovenian Chetniks lol.](https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenski_%C4%8Detnici). They were guerilla fighters and there wasn't some high command or chain of command in formal sense as it would be in the regular army. Very early, after the Nazi invasion and the fall of Yugoslavia the Royal Yugoslavian army split in several factions, most of which didn't want to fight against the Nazis. The only (or one of few) faction that wanted to resist the Nazi occupation was led by Draža Mihajlović.  

Other factions cooperated with the Nazis from the beginning and in Bosnia and Croatia severe crimes were committed against the civillians of Croatian and Bosnian Muslim people.

What is also important to note is, while Draža and his movement fought the Fascist, he himself wasn't anti-fascists in the ideological sense. If you can understand what I mean. Yes he hated German fascists, didn't want to see Yugoslavia invaded and ruled by Nazi regime, he wanted free and independent Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but Kingdom of Yugoslavia ruled by Serbian Royalty and where only Serbian word was heard. He was a Serbian nationalist and Royalist. 

Now, Draža's faction enjoyed the allied support, during the 1943 Brits supported both the Partisans and Draža's Chetniks, but as the war was nearing the end British and USA help to Draža started waning and shifting to Partisans. It was clear that Communist Partisans, which accepted people of all nations, is going to win the war. Running short on people, ammunition and supplies, and hating the Communists more then the Nazis, Draža started cooperating with the Nazis, to be specific with the Italians.  Hitler was strongly against this collaboration and wrote personally to Mussolini against it.

In 1944 [Draža's forces rescued around 350 USA soldiers during the failed USA operation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Halyard#/media/File:Operation_Halyard_memorial.jpg) But on other occasion he rescued German soldiers. So it seams near the end he collaborated with both allies and Nazis, but ultimately turning to Germans in the end.

It was very complicated story, my source for all of this is wikipedia, I had to look some things up as I really didn't know. So if you want to know more, read it. XD But as I can see it is far, far from black-and-white narrative.

&gt; There was still a Royal Yugoslav Army in the region or was this a separate branch where he commanded both?

After the Nazis invaded, and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia collapsed, the Royal army ceased to exist. It was split in various factions, as I said before, some fought against the Nazis, some collaborated with Nazis right from the start. The Draža's faction was officially called Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland and was loyal to Yugoslav King and to Brits by extension.  

The Chetnik movement in Croatia for example, developed independently from Draža's movement and was sponsored by the Italians from the beginning and served as militia in NDH.

Data la premessa, però, vorrei sottolineare un aspetto. 

Non gliene frega nulla, alle aziende. Né in Italia, né negli Stati Uniti dove Comcast fa persino di peggio. La pubblicità negativa di un big rant non è la fine del mondo perché, è vero, è negativa e può danneggiare l'azienda, ma viene derubricata come ""i soliti pezzenti che per 30-40 euro al mese vogliono chissà che cosa"" perché il consumatore NON è il bene principale dell'azienda...sono i soldi il bene principale.

Ergo,  il rant non basta. Servono le cause. Dal giudice di pace, dal Corecom, fate voi, ma sono quei contenziosi che fanno veramente male perché costano _molto più_  nonostante eventuali conciliazioni obbligatorie. Oppure anche serve arrivare fino a rompere le balle alla dirigenza in qualche modo, perché tanto il poveraccio al call center è uno schiavo pure lui cui danno la metà di una miseria quando non lo licenziano per andare in Albania.

Ad es. avete visto quell'autista ATAC che ha detto la sua? E' arrivato sui giornali. Direte: sticazzi, cosa cambia? Forse nulla, ma ha fatto molto più rumore di un rant e forse qualcuno potrebbe cagarselo. Insomma, fà più rumore l'associazione per la protezione dei cazzo di gattini (che amo, intendiamoci, ma che cazzo la gente muore di fame però bisogna salvare i gattini?) che non il rant del consumatore che è perfettamente nel giusto, ma che è solo un cazzo di consumatore.",null,0,null,1437856105,null,0,false,0,ctfzscb,null,t3_3ejr4h,null,t1_ctfzscb,null,t3_3ejr4h,null,null,null,1440082623,null,9,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,9,null

Io te lo dico, ma niente ha a che vedere con il fatto che questo articolo è spazzatura, eh, ci tengo a ribadirlo. 

Rispetto la sentenza, la verità giudiziaria è quella che ci consegna una ragazza che ha raccontato delle cazzate, e a quello rimango. 

Non estrapolerei teoremi da lì, perché nessuno ha montato sto polverone dopo il primo grado, e perché se colpevolizzassimo in questo modo chiunque porta delle accuse in tribunale e ""perde"" sarebbe una follia e una barbarie. E infatti non lo facciamo. A meno di essere mattoidi antifemministi come l'autore dell'articolo.

Ho trovato discutibili, dicevo, parecchi passaggi nelle motivazioni della sentenza. Riferimenti al modo di vestire e alla bisessualità dell'accusatrice: l'idea che questi, e la partecipazione a un film splatter siano indici di una vita ""non lineare"". Il riferimento al fatto che essere tornata a una vita normale, dopo il fatto, rafforzi l'idea di un suo rapporto ""ambivalente"" e ""contraddittorio"" col sesso. Dietro ad una ricostruzione pare puntuale e precisa dell'accaduto, c'è, nella sentenza, un surplus di giudizio sulle scelte di questa ragazza, che avrebbero indebolito la sua capacità di rapportarsi al sesso in generale e a quel sesso di gruppo in particolare.

Well, they were losing significant ground yes, but they weren't ""almost quashed"". 

&gt; If there were no ""world police"" to confront Putin, why wouldn't Russia march into Kiev and install a new puppet?

Russia could march into Kiev anytime they want, they have the ability to do that. There is simply no will or need to do it. Russia want Ukraine to keep out of NATO and the EU, and they are currently achieving this. They are very aware that a full scale invasion would  mean fierce sanctions on Russia, probable removal from SWIFT, and a Iran like embargo on Russia.   Eventually, Ukraine will collapse, and it will be a pretty long time before Russia gets anywhere close to economic collapse. There's only so much we can do to support Ukraine, especially as the EU and NATO have no obligations to do anything, and it's all out of goodwill. 

Even if Ukraine doesn't have a Pro-Russian puppet government, Russia still to this day has Ukraine quite a bit under it's control. They are actively preventing any NATO and EU membership, and with the war, making the economy get very close to the brink of collapse. They may not be able to control certain policies now, but Russia is still preventing Ukraine from joining NATO or the EU, along with damaging the Ukrainian economy hugely.

As I said below, he's not talking about morality, he's talking about economics, in particular the demographics of an ageing population. Japan has a real problem with its current and projected dependency ratio between working age and elderly members of the population, which has enormous consequences on the economic vitality of the nation. Pension and care costs go up (which usually make up a large proportion of welfare costs), and the taxation base goes down. Japan is clearest example of a country which has neither a high fertility rate, nor finds it acceptable to have significant levels of immigration, and it will certainly have huge consequences on its economy (and already is having huge consequences) as a result.

And the figures for the EU:

&gt; For the EU the old age dependency ratio in 2030 is expected to rise to 38.0 % from 25.4 % in 2008. This means that where, in 2008, 100 persons of working age supported 25 persons aged 65 or over, in 2030 they are projected to support 38 persons. The regions’ old age dependency ratio is projected to be between 14.8 % and 70.2 % while in 2008 it ranged between 12.7 % and 43.3 %. It is noted that in more than half of the 281 regions the old age dependency ratio is projected to increase by more than 13 percentage points over the period 2008-2030.

My main point was, that without someone defending Israel, it wouldn't exist thus a homeland for Jewish people would not exist. You want Jewish people to have a homeland, don't you? Great. Now how about other people?

distracting again. If an English person said that England belonged to English people, you would call them racist, wouldn't you? So that's a double standard now isn't it? Why can't you explain that logic to me? Also, British people today are a minority in their own capital city, and expected to be an overall minority in 2060, and somehow you are forced to celebrate that and anyone who doesn't is called a racist.

More than 75 000 immigrants arrived in Hungary illegally this year alone, Hungary has the highest number of incoming immigrants per citizen. At this rate, the number of illegals will reach the population of a medium sized city by the year's end.

In Debrecen the number of illegal immigrants reached more than twice the capacity of the migrant camp in a matter of weeks. A religious fight broke out at the camp between two groups of illegal immigrants, which then spilled out on to the neighboring streets. The enraged illegal immigrants attacked passing cars, and set trash cans on fire.

This is the reason Hungary is building a fence on its border with Serbia: to protect the people of Hungary and the people of Europe.

You obviously missed last week's opinion poll. That is significant, even a majority (41%:34%) support for an EU federation across EU28.

You also overestimate ""the bottom-up desire"" that led to creation of other federations. The USA fought a bloody civil war to eliminate the States' Rights concept. Before the Civil War the term USA was regularly used as plural. They, the United States of America.

&gt;You need some sort of positive aspiration and willingness by people themselves.

I find the entire European Union idea to be almost exclusively based on hope and positive thinking. One of the least fear-based major political ideas I've ever seen.

Yeah, it's a little bit more complicated than what those at the UN are saying. Stop talking about Palestine. You're distracting from my overall point.

&gt; Yea, I know you guys really like this narrative, but that's because the people that lived there became more wealth and choose to move to the suburbs. Nobody who can afford to live in a nicer area, chooses to live in inner cities. The fact that you even bring up that is really quite sad. And I'm fairly sure that the UK is in-fact governed by British people. I don't get what point your trying to make here. Last time I checked the British government was, in-fact, British.

But the fact is that non-English population is increasing very fast. What percentage of England is non-English now? What will it be in 2050? Do you deny those trends? I don't understand what you're trying to say here. Just because Britain is still majority English, means we can't complain right now. When can we start complaining? When English are at 49%?

&gt; Pretty sure everyone born in a country is from that country. So unless that country has low birth-rates, a problem which has absolutely nothing to do with immigration, than no, there are just as many (if not more) than ever before.

Proportion of people with French ancestry in France is decreasing. Is that not a fact? Or is this your way to say that anyone who steps on French land automatically becomes French? Because t  
Again, you're making so many off-topic comments, when all I want you to do is address this:  

Homeland for Jewish people = Israel = okay! (I assume, you didn't say either way)    
Homeland for Korean people = South Korea = okay!  
Homeland for Japanese people in Japan = okay!  
Homeland for French people in France = racist  
  
Just explain that logic to me. That's all I want. I don't want to talk about Palestine or the effect of suburbanization. Just the math in those four lines. That's it.

That's exactly what AKP did too. Tons of military personnel, tons of journalists, tons of politicians with opposing views have been arrested. There was this huge trial called the ""Ergenekon Trial"", where all those people were arrested for treason. It was a total shit show. Every single proof they presented was either proved to be manufactured(of course nobody could say anything because AKP had complete control over the court), or unsuitable to use in court. They kept hundreds of innocent people in jail for years under special ""prolonged custody"", which was repeatedly declared unlawful by multiple courts. But again, nobody could do anything about it because AKP had total control over the police as well. Some older people died of sickness in jail, some committed suicide. Last year the trial finally failed and everyone(at least I think everyone) was released. Nobody was surprised nobody got arrested, because everyone knew all the suspects were falsely accused.

AKP also banned Twitter, Youtube, facebook, certain newspapers, magazines and -as I said above- arrested journalists. Press was never free while AKP was in charge. Maybe in the early years when they weren't this powerful.

In other words, AKP was *not* less authoritarian and illiberal than the Kemalists, who also can't be the only ones to blame since they were always in a coalition with less-than-kemalist parties.

Officers of the Royal army of Kingdom of Yugoslavia, who were of Croatian ethnicity were called ''Domobrani'' and they collaborated with the Axis from the start, same as Serbian Chetniks in Croatia. Both of these factions are of course different from the Ustasha, at least formally. So basically Domobrani were Croatian version of Chetniks, ex Royal officers and soldiers who collaborated with the Axis.

French food is fucking mediocre, this might come as a huge fucking shock but there is a literal **world** full of spices and flavors that the French can't stomach because it is ""le too hot on meh tongue"".

There are other ways to prepare food other than drowning it in cream and butter.

But (say) Japan is doing fine. Better than fine. The 'nightmare scenario' of a shrinking, aging population that we're told will befall Europe if we don't allow near-unregulated immigration, is daily life in Japan, and yet Japan is *still* doing fine. GDP per capita is high and stable and even still rising a bit (which is more than a lot of us can say), living standards are high, crime is virtually absent, discord is virtually absent. There are no riots, no social unrest, barely any real poverty, the wealth gap is relatively small. There is also basically no racism (even if that's because there basically isn't anyone to be racist against), and no ethnic tensions, and no ghettos.

So should they, in the name of diversity and progression, open their borders and actively strive to become as multicultural as the suburbs of Paris? Would that make Japan a better place to live for the Japanese? Or would they be smarter to simply ignore people calling them xenophobic racists? 

You're not necessarily a racist for not opening your borders. In Europe we have multiculturalism now, and there is simply nothing to be done about that, except ethnic cleansing which we obviously should not do because that's evil. But that does not mean Japan is automatically obligated to adopt multiculturalism as well.

In your original post you talked about how these people were ""arabic looking"" and  how they are ""intimidating"" for, as you put it ""OBVIOUS reasons"". And I can imagine what those OBVIOUS reasons are in your mind.

The current refugee system in Germany is terrible, these people need help and they receive only rudimentary support here. I am not saying that Germany or any other country should just let everyone in, that wouldn't solve any of the problems in these people's home countries. I am saying that these people aren't bad people for coming here, they are not these malicious invaders that some people make them out to be. The people that come here seek something you and me already have simply by being born in the right place at the right time.

And so what if you meant the Germans when you used that little animal analogy. Should the intolerance and hate of a few dictate how these people are treated ? Also how are the Germans being threatened to justify any such behaviour ?

I've just had it with this simplified nonsense. Shouldn't we know by now that this stuff doesn't solve ANYTHING ? At the end of the day we're all people and we should all at least try to understand each other.

In 2013 526000 migrants arrived in the UK, of those around 24000 (or 4.6%) were asylum seekers. The rest were legal migrants. 14% were UK nationals coming home. 38% were legal migrants from other EU countries (you can't legally stop them from coming). 47% were non-EU immigrants. 

But about 340000 people also left in 2013 so the **net migration** rate for 2013 was 186000. The net migration did increase to 260000 in 2014 but it is still below the peak of 320000 in 2005. Also the net migration of non-EU nationals was a 138,000 in 2013 and a 197,000 in 2014.

America and Israel (I can't speak about Lebanon because I simply don't know enough) were created after a foreign power had invaded and established a foothold in the region/domination over the local population (Ironically enough, it was the British in both cases). I don't know enough about Israel to really talk about anything beyond that, though, so I'm going to focus on American history from here on out.

America had many wars with Native American tribes, but the U.S. was stronger. We did not displace Native groups through slowly moving into their lands then impressing our will. We did it through conquest. We broke treaties and committed massacres. That's why the first comment I responded to was so, for lack of a better term, outrageous. 

What Europe is experiencing now is nothing like what happened to the Native Americans. If anything, it's more like the Irish or Italians immigrating: Poor people from troubled areas come over to a new land with a different culture and religion (Catholicism as opposed to American Protestantism). First and second generation immigrants live in their own enclaves (like Little Italy in New York City), speak their own languages, and do not fit in with the broader area.

.... you're talking about nationality here. I'm talking about people. Are you denying that English people exist? Because that's what I'm talking about. Proportion of people with English ancestry to whom these lands belong, is shrinking. That's a fact.

&gt; No, but if they are born there, or gain citizenship, than yes. That is not actually decreasing. 

I don't want them to gain citizenship. I don't want multi-ethnic, multi-cultural states. France belongs to people of French ancestry. It's that simple.

&gt; Someone is saying that? Last time I checked the people of France are not being forced out of France, nor is anyone attempting to do so.

saying ""Germany belongs to Germans"" is probably punishable by law these days. Either way, the media and its puppets will call you a racist if you said anything like that. That's oppression to me.

And if it were only one single person, that person still cannot be ignored or their actions invalidated. That doesn't make the whole religion or culture or whatever responsible for the actions of this person, it's only this single person that has to be prosecuted and there is nothing wrong with hating this single person for their actions and it doesn't make anyone racist, if they hate a terrorist, simply because the terrorist isn't white.

&gt;What do you mean the buying is indiscriminate ? The holdings do not follow any obvious rule such as proportional to gdp or outstanding debt as far as I can tell, they look very discriminate, but i may be missing something - is there such a rule ?

They have to, buying up more from one country could be seen as a funding mechanism for those states rather than general liquidity policy.

&gt;As it is I expect them to purchase bonds when their price declines, perhaps trying to cap their yield spread to some target level.

What I would expect is that they mostly try to buy when there are few buyers on a market, to give an impression of readily available liquidation options for holders of financial assets.

For example, in The Netherlands, which is the country I'm from, there is a political party which denied women the right to become politically active in their party. Even though the denial of women has luckily been overturned by the justice system, this party still denies the equality of women in their election program (['Daad bij het Woord: de SGP stáát ervoor!'](https://www.sgp.nl/Media/download/82/Verkiezingsprogramma+2012-2017.pdf?), p. 3). This is not some scary muslim party I'm talking about, but a party founded on the principles of the Dutch Reformed Church. This is the same church that was the state church in The Netherlands for hundreds of years. 

So what are you going to say to them? That they have to integrate in society even though no one is going to deny that they are part of society? Or are you going to allow them to define Dutchness for themselves? And if you allow them, shouldn't an immigrant be allowed too to decide for him or herself how they want to define being Dutch?

This of course doesn't mean you have to agree with them, just that you're not going to deny or question someone's Dutchness for disagreeing with you.

It happened twice. Visa free regime was established and initially things were quiet. Few gypsies arrived to Canada, asked for asylum and obtained it almost automatically. Everybody knew they are little poor oppressed angels, so just knowing few words in gypsy language was enough to become successfull asylant.

Then a Czech TV sent a reporter to map the situation. A professional gypsy beggar (Maria Bangova from Toronto) talked about the Canadian paradise and called all her relatives to follow her and come there too. After this was broadcasted thousand of gypsies bought tickets and flew to Canada. Within months frightened Canadian government set up very strict visa regime which lasted for a decade.

After Canada lifted visa duty the flow restarted immediatelly. This time it was much better organised - gypsies were told what to claim and how to get most out of the social system. After couple of months Canada re-established visa again. Newly arrived gypsies were almost all automatically deported. 

Canada later changed their laws, making it virtually impossible for Czech gypsies to ask for asylum.

Probably not, It's not that simple, as things like that can contribute to hostile nationalism and feelings towards our country

Personally I don't care what they do, they are so small, I can't see them actually ever being a threat to Greece, their military is extremely poorly armed, and their economy is weak, even by Greek standards, haha. If Macedonian ever tried to harm Greece in anyway we could steamroll them in a matter of hours. 

And any of the claims of being ""Ethnic"" Macedonians etc is easily debunked and all historians know that as well as the rest of the world, the only ones who believe it are Macedonian Nationalists. The claims are not backed by historical evidence so it wouldn't damage our national image either.

null,false,Futurist110,null,null,null,"&gt; I agree, and this worries me a bit - we all know what this led up to. The apparently (my impression) extreme nationalism in Russia today seems to confirm this :-/

Yes, but there is one crucial distinction between Hitler and Putin--Putin is less of a gambler and more of a showman than Hitler is. In other words, Hitler was a German nationalist out of conviction whereas Putin appears to be a Russian nationalist out of political expediency (after he saw that delivering economic growth might no longer be enough for him to remain in power, he changed course around 2012 and began pursuing more nationalistic and anti-Western policies instead in order to get more Russian nationalists to support him). Likewise, while Putin would have probably been content with Austria and the Sudetenland if he was in Hitler's place in 1938, Hitler was certainly not content with this; thus, while Hitler was willing to gamble big and to risk losing everything (as he actually ended up doing later on), Putin is certainly not willing to do this.

Also, for the record, I do think that 1930s Germany and today's Russia have legitimate concerns, interests, and grievances; however, the ways in which Putin and especially Hitler handled these things was certainly wrong.

&gt; The situation there today is as shitty as it is in some part due to ""someone"" (Europeans) already having redrawn the borders there --

The Europeans didn't give a damn about ethnic and religious lines when they redrew the borders of the Middle East after World War I, though. In contrast, the Europeans *did* give a damn about ethnic lines when they re-drew their own borders after World War I and after World War II.

&gt; so, I'm not too optimistic that somene doing that again would improve the situation.

Well, a lot might depend on how exactly this redrawing is handled.

&gt; Also, I don't think the various ethnicities' territories are sufficently cohesive that this could work without massive expulsions.

Honestly, it might depend on where exactly in the Middle East we are talking about here; after all, aren't there many largely homogeneous Kurdish-majority areas in the Middle East? If so, then the Kurds in Iraq and Syria should probably be encouraged to form their own independent state (and then to sign a border treaty with Turkey as well as to have the West bribe Turkey so that it will accept this).

&gt; As for expulsions -- I think realistically, there would be massive ethnic cleansing including horrible atrocities. (just look at the wars in former Yugoslavia)

And there aren't horrible atrocities going on in the Middle East *right now*? After all, I can't imagine that many Iraqi and Syrian Shiites, Kurds, and Christians are currently living under ISIS rule.

&gt; IMHO the only way to peacefully resolve this would be if the enmities between ethnicities and religions/denominations could eventually be overcome so that the (frankly stupid) borders became less relevant than they are today. (kind of like today's Europe) Unfortunately this seems like an unlikely scenario to happen in the forseeable future. Still, unless it does happen, I see no peaceful resolution to the situation there.

I largely agree with you, but I also think that one should keep open the option of redrawing bad borders; after all, Europe doesn't only have open borders, but also has borders which largely (more-or-less) correspond with the ethnic borders in Europe. Also, in spite of this, there are still currently large-scale demands for border redrawing even in Europe--just look at Scotland (where the pro-independence side got almost 45% in a referendum last year) and Catalonia (where I think that support for independence is above 40%).",null,0,null,1437861816,null,0,false,0,ctg2qac,null,t3_3edwkm,null,t1_ctg2qac,null,t1_ctfzbpq,null,null,null,1440084010,null,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2,null

Having large groups of people maintaining different fundamental values from the rest of the population is a national security problem of the highest rank.

It's an illusion to think a group of immigrants can simultaneously share one set of values between themselves and another conflicting set of values with their hosting society. It's also an illusion to think they can keep their religion and culture unaltered. Some have songs they sang all their lives about hating or killing some other group of people (e.g. Jews) and those songs are tied to their childhood. Being an immigrant requires you break away from those songs, which is very difficult. Some religions encourage beating your wife if she's not obedient and handling your daughters like whores if they don't marry as virgins. Being an immigrant means you can't keep practicing that religion unchanged, which is extremely difficult.

null,false,CAPS_4_FUN,null,null,null,"&gt; So you want to kick British people out of England?

You're confusing nationality with ethnicity. You're confusing Britain versus United Kingdom too. If some neighboring Irish came here some time ago and mixed with English, then that's not the end of the world. The problem is when England opens its doors to everyone and declares itself ""multicultural"". I should have used England instead of Britain from the beginning. When I say British, I mean English.

&gt; And that has nothing to do with you? Every country including France has a way of gaining citizenship, your opinion on that doesn't mean anything (unless you are French and thus can exercise your democratic right to vote against any part that supports that), but if you are not, than your opinion on it means nothing.

I still support their right to remain independent and homogenous. Democracy wouldn't work, because like I said, the ""new French"" who are rising in numbers will vote in another direction. Just look at the politics of the US = import more of Mexico, or we won't vote for you.

&gt; Saying things you don't actually know are true kinda makes you look like one of those blind racists.

I'm exaggerating yes, but I'm positive that someone would call you a racist for saying that.

&gt; So you can deny people a homeland...by not actually denying them a homeland? Interesting...

Why is it so hard for you to understand? French (ethnicity) people exist. France is where their ancestors originated at. They want to be surrounded by french, ruled by french, develop organic french culture, and live and profit off french resources and land. This is what makes it their HOMEland. Otherwise it's just a piece of land that might as well be anywhere in the world. Replace French with Jewish and then you might understand. Yes, French can still live there, but once France is no longer about French, then the connection is gone and it just becomes land rather than a united ethnic community working towards something bigger than themselves.

&gt; How is France changing again? Or any of the other countries you've been mindlessly droning on about.

You're giving it away to people who have no right to be here, rather than devoting it to the children of their ancestors who fought and worked hard to make it valuable through chains of generations. French children are rightful heirs to these lands, that they have inherited and built on through generations. All of it. Multiculturalism is not strength, I already told you. The french would rather prefer keeping it homogenous and united, but many are even afraid of saying it because it's racist nowadays. It's weakening the country, and destroying any kind of group cohesiveness and chemistry that homogenous nations thrive off. Foreign by definition is foreign. Look, if you're brave enough, you'd read Generation Identity by Markus Willinger, I'd send it to you, but I guess that's too racist for you? That book summarizes every nationalist's thoughts in an effective way.

&gt; And still does.

You're thinking in terms of legality here. Yes, nothing tangible is being taken away from French people, your house will always be your house, but my point that it's about much more than that.",null,0,null,1437862179,null,0,false,0,ctg2wzq,null,t3_3ek36g,null,t1_ctg2wzq,null,t1_ctg23lc,null,null,null,1440084098,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

This might be unique to the UK. I remembered reading about the issue of coal subsidies a while back and tried to read up on it again.

These problems were very elementary Cultural miss-understand and was very simple for the workplace human resources to resolve - both I and the other part agreed what had been said and human resources had a good laugh and tried to translate to my co-worker what I had said. In the other case it was an e-mail, and was also easy resolved by reading the mail.

My point is that happened because of lack of integration. Both these individuals had hard time in the workplace because of it and was involved in many serious disputes with other co-workers and there was much hidden hostility against them. The problem was that cultural problems could be presented as racism and the company was afraid of lawsuits so it was hidden.

I've been lurking around this subreddit for a few good weeks, soaking in all the info about the EU and greece and Russia and so on, learning more and more about the ""continental system"" as it were. Now I'm British, and I'd like to think I'm a bit of a liberal socialist. I'm a strong believer in the duty of the state for the people and so on. At the same time, I think the idea of the EU, what it stands for in terms of equality, liberty and brotherhood is a legacy to behold. The true heir to Rome, Charlemagne and Napoleon rests somewhere in this mish-mash of bureaucracy, but honestly there are some things that I don't think hold up to scrutiny. 

The whole dealing with Greece felt so much more like punishment than support, even though the Greek Govt wanted to work to make Greece better than it has been for a long time. It certainly feels as if the North of the EU, IE France and Germany, want very little to do with the south. A lot of my issues come with the single currency, or more importantly, the lack of a fiscal union. That also highlights the biggest issue I have with Europe, that it's representation is shocking. The Greek people vote to get rid of austerity? Here's more German Imposed austerity. Who's the president of the commission? Hell if I know, but I do know no one here voted for him. Or can we vote for them? What electoral power do we have? It's all too unclear and shrouded in Laissez Faire economics and a general lack of direct or representational democracy that it's no wonder there's so much disillusion with Europe. 

In two years time, I want to vote for Europe. To stay in. But honestly, I'm not sure what I'm voting for. Am I missing something? I know the EU has done great things, such as the human rights act and the general victory of annihilating the chances of ANOTHER European war tearing up this blood soaked continent again. And there are parts of the EU which I really think symbolise the idealism that this continent has always dreamed of, a united Europe for the people of Europe, but right now it all stinks of disappointment and austerity. A lot of people recently have been suggesting that the EU needs to integrate more, be more federalised. I'm gonna have to say I'd be all for that, if it'd work. And if, only if, I get shown some how that we'll feel represented. 

tl;dr, There's a whole mess of issues that I have with the EU, especially Austerity and the German dominated economy, and I wouldn't wanna touch the Euro with a barge pole considering it's issues, but I still love the idea of the EU.

Don't want to drink alcohol? I don't care.

Speak another language in your home? I don't care.

Want to dress differently? I don't care, just be employable.

Don't fit within our current political spectrum? I don't care, just don't break the law.

Hold different religious convictions? I don't care, just don't break the law.

Have different views on human rights? I don't care, just don't break the law.

Don't socialize much with the ""natives""? I don't care as long as these three things are okay.

And so on...

There is a mentality out there that I find sickening where immigrants have to be turned into the ""natives'"" ideal person, as if you paying to move your belongings from one part of the surface of the planet to another and having some paperwork done gives others the right to decide how you should live.

People command so without really being able to define their own culture and how they can call their neighbor ""nationality x"" while often disagreeing on long lists of fundamental issues. There is a huge problem of explaining this position.

So, I think focusing on these three things is enough.

It's not really a story about the left protesting against right-wing homosexuals, it's a story about the pride crowd avoiding the SD event in preference of an outspokenly non-racist alternative. I'm not even sure why they label it left-wing, non-racism is hardly exclusive to the left.

I'm married to a Slovak citizen. The paperwork I had to go through took about a year. First it was dealing with the US government to get my background check completed (Which sadly, took around 2 months). After that, my wife had to get copies of my birth certificate, our wedding certificate, my background check, and then get all the copies translated, then verified and stamped. After that long process, I came here to get a health check up in this country, and then turn in my finished papers and spoke with the ""foreign police"". They sat there and asked me questions for the better part of two hours, while they double checked every single line of all the paperwork (three people checked it).

&gt; (Note on me coming here: The foreign police needed to know who my parents and siblings were. Their locations and contact information. Previous employers were also needed. They also looked into my wife and her family to make sure there was nothing with them. That shows how extensive a lot of the paperwork was)

When I moved to Slovakia from the US, it wasn't too difficult (Except for the language). Coming from places like Wisconsin, I was used to having a nice nature. We didn't have the mountains back home of course, but it wasn't hard adapting. The weather is also similar so it was easy.

My blood is mostly German, Irish and Polish, so I'd grown up on foods from all 3. Getting used to different types of sausages, cabbage, pork, etc, was nothing for me.

I did realize people dress much more appropriately here, which was something to get used to. I was used to dressing like a scrub on non-work days because people do that back in the US when they're relaxing.

I also made sure to learn some basics to the language immediately. While it wasn't too bad as many people here speak English (rather well, much better than I expected).

After living here for about 3 months, the ""foreign police"" actually came to my home, to check in on what I was up to, to make sure I was living where I said I would be, and actually did a partial inspection of our flat. After verifying everything, their truck stayed outside my apartment for about 4 hours(I felt that was strange, but who knows).

It took the better part of a year for me to get my temporary citizenship. We had to jump through hoops to get everything setup. We luckily got my permit 4 days before I had to go back to the US (That would have been a pain).

In the 9 months of having my temporary citizenship, I have worked, got insurance in this country, gotten to know politics, learned quite a bit of the language(and let me tell you, it's not easy), and have adjusted to the culture.

null,false,MartianSky,BAVA,Bayern,null,"&gt; Yes, but there is one crucial distinction between Hitler and Putin--Putin is less of a gambler and more of a showman than Hitler is.

I hope so. It's just that 1) Putin seems unpredictable and 2) most people didn't expect the Nazis to go as far as they did either (just ask Chamberlain). Not saying you're wrong, just that I'm deeply uncomfortable with that guy and the general nationalistic vibe in Russia.

&gt; The Europeans didn't give a damn about ethnic and religious lines when they redrew the borders of the Middle East after World War I, though.

True.

&gt; In contrast, the Europeans did give a damn about ethnic lines when they re-drew their own borders after World War I and after World War II.

Not so sure. Especially in eastern Europe, it had more to do with Stalin's ambitions than ethnic lines, me thinks. Also, there were mass expulsions in Europe to adapt the ethnic lines to the newly drawn borders. (This definitely happened for the ethnically German territories in the east, but I guess something similar happened in the former east-Polish territories and probably other occurences that I'm not familiar with... and too lazy/tired to look up now) Also, -as you hinted at yourself- these borders did not come about peacefully, but as an outcome of two world wars.

IMO, the peaceful situation today has more to do with building bridges between the ethnic groups and realizing the madness of going to war over such things.

&gt; Honestly, it might depend on where exactly in the Middle East we are talking about here; after all, aren't there many largely homogeneous Kurdish-majority areas in the Middle East? If so, then the Kurds in Iraq and Syria should probably be encouraged to form their own independent state (and then to sign a border treaty with Turkey as well as to have the West bribe Turkey so that it will accept this).

Yes -- AFAIK, there are. Unfortunately those extend way into Turkey, so Turkey would be somewhat... ""hesistant""... to allow the Kurds their own state.

Also, things would probably be a lot more complicated for other ethnicities.

Anyway, the conflicts between Sunni and Shiites (and other denominations) is just something that has to be worked out. Which is not an easy matter. Europe suffered through devastating conflicts before similar conflicts could be contained. Looking at Ireland, even that containment is a reletively recent development.

I imagine that achieving a mutually agreed upon redrawing of borders would require a level of trust and common identity that would make this even less likely than an EU/Schengen-like arrangement.

&gt; And there aren't horrible atrocities going on in the Middle East right now? After all, I can't imagine that many Iraqi and Syrian Shiites, Kurds, and Christians are currently living under ISIS rule.

Yes, it's a clusterfuck. Still, redrawing borders on a large scale could make things even worse. (Concerning ISIS: I don't think this is even an ethnic conflict at it's core. In my view it's more like a barbarian horde that happens to be composed of (mostly?) Sunnites.)

&gt; Also, in spite of this, there are still currently large-scale demands for border redrawing even in Europe--just look at Scotland (where the pro-independence side got almost 45% in a referendum last year) and Catalonia (where I think that support for independence is above 40%).

Yes, not everything is peachy. However, I try to take a positive (naive?) view on the separatism-issue: The popularity of those movements may be encouraged by the notion that with growing European unification, large/strong national states are becoming less important than they once were.

Well they're probably not very problematic. They're next door neighbours so it's kind of like the Danish refugees that fled to Sweden during ww2. We just placed them in Skåne and they adapted to society pretty well. Hell even the baltic refugees during the cold war presented little to no problems when integrating them into society.

You can't make this shit up. The people who were telling white homophobes to just grow up 10 years ago are now saying we must not offend the homophobes because that would be racist.

This is all so colossally retarded that I can't even say anything.

My opinion on the matter is that the LGBT community in Sweden worked hard to achieve the rights and the level of acceptance in society that they enjoy today and if someone (Be they atheists, muslims, or christians) wants to change this they can just fuck off and go play with ISIS for all I care.",null,0,null,1437869603,null,0,false,0,ctg6om9,null,t3_3ekbvn,null,t1_ctg6om9,null,t1_ctg0yds,null,null,null,1440085939,null,25,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,25,null

null,false,Futurist110,null,null,null,"&gt; I hope so. It's just that 1) Putin seems unpredictable

Actually, Putin seems to be *very* predictable.

&gt; and 2) most people didn't expect the Nazis to go as far as they did either (just ask Chamberlain).

Didn't Hitler talk about invading the Soviet Union in Mein Kampf, though? After all, the impression that I have is that Hitler was *extremely* honest in regards to his future plans, goals, desires, and policies in Mein Kampf.

&gt; Not saying you're wrong, just that I'm deeply uncomfortable with that guy and the general nationalistic vibe in Russia.

I certainly understand where you are coming from in this regard; also, let me say this--Putin certainly should be contained. After all, bullies should be put in their place. However, we also need to understand that Putin is almost certainly much less of a gambler than Hitler was.

&gt; Not so sure. Especially in eastern Europe, it had more to do with Stalin's ambitions than ethnic lines, me thinks.

Yes, but these ambitions were still reflected in ethnic lines and national boundaries matching more closely than they did before.

&gt; Also, there were mass expulsions in Europe to adapt the ethnic lines to the newly drawn borders. (This definitely happened for the ethnically German territories in the east, but I guess something similar happened in the former east-Polish territories and probably other occurences that I'm not familiar with... and too lazy/tired to look up now)

Yes, you are certainly correct in regards to this, and that part was certainly a shame. However, better national borders based on ethnic lines could have still been drawn in Eastern Europe after the end of World War II without any expulsions; of course, this would have meant allowing Germany to keep areas such as the Sudetenland and Danzig, which would have been unacceptable to the World War II Allies.

&gt; Also, -as you hinted at yourself- these borders did not come about peacefully, but as an outcome of two world wars.

Yes; correct! Of course, just one World War (the first one) and some negotiation afterwards might have been enough in regards to this; we simply got unlucky and had to deal with a second World War as well.

&gt; IMO, the peaceful situation today has more to do with building bridges between the ethnic groups and realizing the madness of going to war over such things.

Actually, I'd argue that it is both this and national borders matching ethnic lines more closely. After all, having better national borders might have very well allowed more people to have a greater say in determining their own destiny.

Also, as a side note, World War I certainly did not break out as a result of a desire to redraw national borders along ethnic lines (well, other than maybe on the part of Serbs); rather, the redrawing of national borders more along ethnic lines was simply a (IMHO pleasant) consequence of the Entente/Allied victory in World War I.

Also, for the record, I support allowing U.S. states to hold a binding referendum in regards to seceding from the U.S. as well; thus, I am consistent in regards to this.

&gt; Yes -- AFAIK, there are. Unfortunately those extend way into Turkey, so Turkey would be somewhat... ""hesistant""... to allow the Kurds their own state.

How about creating a new independent Kurdish state only out of the overwhelmingly Kurdish-majority areas of Iraq and Syria, though? After all, this will still result in many/most Kurds having their own state.

&gt; Also, things would probably be a lot more complicated for other ethnicities.

Maybe, but we need to look at more detailed data for this beforehand.

&gt; Anyway, the conflicts between Sunni and Shiites (and other denominations) is just something that has to be worked out.

Yes, I agree with this.

&gt; Which is not an easy matter. Europe suffered through devastating conflicts before similar conflicts could be contained. Looking at Ireland, even that containment is a reletively recent development.

Agreed; of course, it is worth noting that, in the case of Ireland, a partition more-or-less along religious lines also occurred. Thus, your point here in regards to Ireland might also ironically strengthen my own points and arguments here.

&gt; I imagine that achieving a mutually agreed upon redrawing of borders would require a level of trust and common identity that would make this even less likely than an EU/Schengen-like arrangement.

Honestly, it might depend on various factors. Of course, one can simply create ""facts on the ground"" and hope that everyone or almost everyone will eventually accept the new realities in regards to this.

&gt; Yes, it's a clusterfuck. Still, redrawing borders on a large scale could make things even worse.

You *might* be correct in regards to this; however, at this point in time, we need more information before we can make solid conclusions in regards to this.

&gt; (Concerning ISIS: I don't think this is even an ethnic conflict at it's core. In my view it's more like a barbarian horde that happens to be composed of (mostly?) Sunnites.)

Yes, but aren't the overwhelming majority of ISIS-controlled areas overwhelmingly Sunni areas (or at least overwhelmingly Sunni areas *right now*)?

&gt; Yes, not everything is peachy. However, I try to take a positive (naive?) view on the separatism-issue: The popularity of those movements may be encouraged by the notion that with growing European unification, large/strong national states are becoming less important than they once were. (although these movements would still exist without the EU, obviously)

Yes, I agree with this; however, this appears to strengthen my point that even with much greater cooperation and interactions between various countries, national borders still matter.",null,0,null,1437869639,null,0,false,0,ctg6pa2,null,t3_3edwkm,null,t1_ctg6pa2,null,t1_ctg5nrf,null,null,null,1440085948,null,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2,null

no it won't. Fertility rate has decreased, but it's not **continuing** to decrease. They just have to ""ride out"" these previous old generations of people, but after that, the next generation of old people will be in reasonable proportion with the size of the young generation. The numbers will adjust to lower fertility rates once old people from ""high-fertility generations"" have died out. It will be expensive, but it will get better over time.

If everyone is the same, then how can there be diversity? You contradict yourself. I see people of my ethnicity as my super extended family. That's the connection that other individuals don't have.

A parade organised by straight people and executed by straight people is not a pride parade no matter which way you look at it. 

That said *even if* the march was entirely composed of rightwing GSM people, I'd still disagree with it because it's stealing what is a movement for tolerance and acceptance and using it to display intolerance and rejection.

Again: the PURPOSE of this parade is **not** to show LGBTQ pride, instead it is to **provoke immigrants**. It is not a genuine pride parade *at all*. 

I'd bet money that the organisers hope there will be violence and hatred directed towards them, so then they trumpet to everyone how ""bad and intolerant"" immigrants are.

The reality is that the only thing making them extra ordinary is that they want to reduce Swedens very high level of immigration per capita. But to a leftist in sweden, that's race hate. Even if SD are stating over and over and over again that they want to spend money at refugee camps in war zones, since you can help a lot more people, the left still like to think that they are racist.

The reality is that most leftist tend to think that anything that is not increasing immigration year after year is racist and extreme right. It does not matter if it's about reducing the levels of immigration to early 2000's when the social democrats ruled the country, still racist.

Here is a brief outline of what the party looked like during its early years. Since 2002 they have been modernizing and have become much more of a right wing populist party and much less far right extremists. 

&gt;On 30 November 1993, SD organized a manifestation to celebrate the late
king of Sweden, Karl XII. Approximately 1000 people took part in the
event, which ended in chaos and violence. At the front, the Nazi flag dangled
beside the national Swedish flag. On this particular night in Stockholm, the
entire city-centre resonated to the crowd’s shouts of ‘Sieg Heil’ (see further
Tamas, 2003). In 1989, SD held its first annual meeting and elected Anders
Klarström as the party’s president. Prior to this, Klarström had been a
member of the neo-Nazi party Nordiska Rikspartiet and had a criminal
record that included the stealing of ammunition, vandalism and making
illegal threats (Larsson and Ekman, 2001: 126). Other representatives of the
party executive had similar backgrounds. Some were members of violent
extreme right movements such as the Vitt Ariskt Motstånd (White Arian
Resistance) and Bevara Sverige Svenskt (Keep Sweden Swedish), or
involved in the growing industry of white power music. In its members’
bulletin of 1989, SD published a list of addresses of allies outside Sweden,
i.e. the Front National in France, pro-apartheid newspapers in South Africa,
a Ku Klux Klan affiliated journal in the USA and the journal Spearhead,
published by the notorious neo-Nazist John Tydall in England (Larsson and
Ekman 2001: 130). [Source.](http://etn.sagepub.com/content/10/1/55)",null,1,null,1437875292,null,0,1437878934,0,ctg9i9q,null,t3_3elk20,null,t1_ctg9i9q,null,t1_ctg7k4h,null,null,null,1440087268,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

That's BS. The actual reason lies in nuclear deterrent that Russia has directly and Turkey has through its alliance with the US (with some American warheads deployed in Turkey). It is impossible for them to reach victory. All paths lead to nuclear exchange, which is lose-lose situation for both of them. This, in turn, forces to settle differences through diplomacy.

The same effect of nuclear peace is more clearly observable in [Indo-Pakistani relations](https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ins/summary/v033/33.2.ganguly.html).

I don't know how people justify the idea that we're all progressive liberals. The mod teams political views are really varied, and there's roughly an equal number who are left and right wing. 

I mean, if we were really all progressive SJWs (although I hate the word SJW because it's just used to straw-man all the time) then don't you think we would have done something about all of the anti-immigration comments, commenters and submissions? /r/europe is now regularly cited as one of the right of centre or right wing subreddit and a lot of users who could be described as SJWs have left for that reason. If we were SJWs, why haven't we cracked down on it? Every reform we've made to the subreddit has simultaneously had the effect of improving its functionality, whilst being accused of somehow distorting free speech in order to serve some strange über-progressive beliefs that we don't actually have. 

All of the evidence suggests that we're only interested in facilitating honest and open discussion about Europe as best we can, but people, for whatever reasons, don't seem to realise that.

I'm not sure what you mean about migrants concentrating themselves and not speaking English though. We just don't really have those sorts of problems in the way that our social system is set up. As for resentment against migrants from ""locals"", it's not a political or social issue at all and the people at large are more than happy with the status quo, especially in 2015.

This is sometimes mentioned, but in practice I don't think it is where the cultural line lies between immigrants people dislike, and immigrants people accept. There are quite a few people in Copenhagen who don't speak good Danish, and communicate primarily in English in public, and their own language in private. Many of them are middle-class Europeans from places like Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, even Finland. Many work at English-heavy workplaces, like Maersk, tech companies, or the universities, so they don't even learn Danish at work. Those who live in Denmark longer will probably eventually learn Danish, especially if they have kids and the kids go to school in Danish, or if they marry a Dane. But it might take a while, and they often continue to use other languages when possible.

Of course if you ask Danes whether these people should learn Danish or not, most people will answer that they should. But I don't think this group of immigrants is causing many problems or angering many people. When people complain about trouble with unintegrated immigrants, they mean something different than *just* people who don't know Danish.",null,0,null,1437876940,null,0,1437882096,0,ctgaawy,null,t3_3eled9,null,t1_ctgaawy,null,t1_ctg7ojq,null,null,null,1440087644,null,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6,null

Interessante, non sapevo che la decisione di mandare i figli alla scuola privata fosse dettata interamente dal prezzo. Quindi se lo stato rimuovesse i finanziamenti alla scuola privata tutti gli studenti andrebbero nella pubblica, giusto? perché se, per pura sfortuna, così non fosse, ci ritroveremmo a star dando soldi per nessun motivo a famiglie che avrebbero comunque mandato i figli alla scuola privata.

Mumble mumble, sono proprio curioso di sapere se prima del 2000, quando vengono istituiti i finanziamenti pubblici alle private, in Italia esistesse o meno la scuola privata, in particolare quella cattolica. Mumble mumble.

&gt; Sull'equità poi sembri avere le idee poco chiare: è bene ricordare che le tasse le paga anche, e forse di più, chi va alla scuola privata!

Acciderbolina, le avevo proprio poco chiare! Infatti è notoriamente equo che i ricchi paghino le tasse per poi ricevere una sovvenzione pubblica per un servizio di lusso a cui i poveri non possono comunque accedere, giusto? è la definizione di equità!

&gt; Secondo te dovrebbe sovvenzionare quelli che scelgono la pubblica, senza ricevere il minimo concambio in termini di servizi per l'istruzione?

Ma tu mi credi un mostro! Il contracambio lo ricevono eccome: possono mandare i figli alla scuola pubblica! Il tuo buffo ragionamento è equivalente a sostenere che siccome i ricchi pagano le tasse che servono per le case popolari, è giusto che una parte del budget per l'edilizia vada speso in sovvenzioni per le ville di lusso.

---------

Ora, per fare un tl;dr perché va bene prenderti per il culo ma poi bisogna pure quagliare: la domanda di istruzione privata è altamente inelastica, come dimostrato dalla costanza incredibilmente stretta della percentuale degli alunni nelle private (10% fisso per gli ultimi due decenni) e, in modo più divertente, dal risibile fallimento del sistema di voucher di Formigoni (che non ha mandato manco un alunno in più alle private, pur spendendoci 400 milioni di euro). 

Questo significa, in termini ancor più terra terra, che c'è una percentuale fisiologica di famiglie che mandano i figli alle scuole private, a prescindere dalle sovvenzioni. Non c'è nessun risparmio a sovvenzionare queste famiglie, ma solo una spesa ulteriore che, visti i tempi di magra, inevitabilmente sottrae fondi alla scuola pubblica. Ora, visto che in Italia dovrebbero essere le 4 del mattino, possiamo risparmiarci di andare a tirar fuori le statistiche e ammettere direttamente che a mandare i figli alle private di solito sono le famiglie più benestanti? perché se possiamo ammettere questo fatto elementare allora possiamo pure serenamente concludere che i finanziamenti alle private non fanno anche che togliere soldi al sistema pubblico per darli direttamente a famiglie benestanti che non ne avrebbero bisogno e che non sono influenzate nelle loro scelte educative da queste sovvenzioni.",null,0,null,1437876965,null,0,false,0,ctgabea,null,t3_3ekir3,null,t1_ctgabea,null,t1_ctg8mrt,null,null,null,1440087650,null,14,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,14,null

&gt; Finally, Germany, Spain, Italy, and several northern European countries required, for domestic political reasons, a ritual humiliation of radical Greek politicians and voters who openly defied EU institutions and austerity demands. Having achieved this, **EU leaders have no further reason to impose austerity on Greece or strictly enforce the terms of the latest bailout.** Instead, they have every incentive to demonstrate the success of their “tough love” policies by **easing austerity to accelerate economic growth, not only in Greece but throughout the eurozone.**

The same could be said after the first and the second bailouts, yet here we are, still on the austerity train.

The author's opinion that the ECB's quantitative easing will indefinitely support Greece is also mistaken. QE will not apply to Greece until some time after the bailout is finalized, and even then, the ECB already holds so much Greek debt that it is limited from buying significantly more:

&gt; European Central Bank purchases of Greek bonds, which may start in a month at the earliest, **will be too small to push the country’s borrowing costs low enough for Athens to regain market access soon.**

&gt; ECB president Mario Draghi has said the bank might have a two-month window after a bailout deal is settled to buy Greek bonds, after which it will quickly hit its self-imposed limit of holding a third of a country’s eligible debt, data shows.

&gt;On 30 November 1993, SD organized a manifestation to celebrate the late
king of Sweden, Karl XII. Approximately 1000 people took part in the
event, which ended in chaos and violence. At the front, the Nazi flag dangled
beside the national Swedish flag. On this particular night in Stockholm, the
entire city-centre resonated to the crowd’s shouts of ‘Sieg Heil’ (see further
Tamas, 2003). In 1989, SD held its first annual meeting and elected Anders
Klarström as the party’s president. Prior to this, Klarström had been a
member of the neo-Nazi party Nordiska Rikspartiet and had a criminal
record that included the stealing of ammunition, vandalism and making
illegal threats (Larsson and Ekman, 2001: 126). Other representatives of the
party executive had similar backgrounds. Some were members of violent
extreme right movements such as the Vitt Ariskt Motstånd (White Arian
Resistance) and Bevara Sverige Svenskt (Keep Sweden Swedish), or
involved in the growing industry of white power music. In its members’
bulletin of 1989, SD published a list of addresses of allies outside Sweden,
i.e. the Front National in France, pro-apartheid newspapers in South Africa,
a Ku Klux Klan affiliated journal in the USA and the journal Spearhead,
published by the notorious neo-Nazist John Tydall in England (Larsson and
Ekman 2001: 130). [Source.](http://etn.sagepub.com/content/10/1/55)

The general idea behind the flair is the same as the Ukraine ones we had before, only we're testing a different implementation. The Ukraine one was added because the sub was flooded with Ukraine content for months. People could press a button to remove those posts because the dominated the front page and excluded other relevant content. I hardly think you'd accuse us of being anti Ukraine. The same thing ought to happen with immigration threads now. Many users find the excess of those kinds of threads unfortunate and leave the sub for elsewhere. This can be avoided through a tagging system. It has nothing to do with the content itself, but simply due to its dominance within the subreddit.

Unfortunately I feel as though we've muddied the water (and thereby it's effectiveness) by having it serve double duty with the comments section and somewhat for brigading warnings. They should all be distinct flares. 

So the controversial tag is there to serve all of those functions. Hopefully you can see the good intentions behind that? The problem is mostly that we implemented it ineffectively (although in our defence, it was a trial which included a whole range of other flares which were largely successful). And further in our defence, it's not like this is any of our jobs. Most of us have other jobs that we spend most of our time on. We've managed to provide an improvement to the subreddit and one small element was badly implemented. Sounds like a success.

I really don't see how this makes us SJWs. It's just a tag! Whatsmore, you're choosing to take a deliberately conspiratorial view of it. Sure, you can see us as creepy pseudo illuminati who are out to get you, or you could just view us as a group of random people who are helping run a subreddit and don't really mind much what's discussed in it. It's up to you, bearing in mind that 90% of what you read about us will be wild speculation and we only rarely have the time to come out and discuss what we're actually doing (like right now).

1. I was once held down and force fed a bacon sandwich. To send me to hell. You know. Cause ""Muzzies cannot eat Bacon"". Problem is? I was Hindu. I didn't eat ANY meat. I do not like bacon. Still. The only reason this was done because I looked Musllim

2. I have had the EDL make threats at me. Surely they aren't racist right? Everyone insists that they aren't racist but are interested in defending the UK against Islamification which is ""fucking hilarious"" cause they cannot tell the difference between people of different faiths and were harassing a Hindu origin Atheist. 

3. Many victims of anti-islamic harassment were NOT Muslims. Let's take Reddit's role in harassment for one. Remember that Boston Bombing perpetrator malarkey? See Reddit decided that Sunil Triparthi who was MIA at the time was the culprit and Triparthi's family were asking for anyone who had seen him to tell them. The news about Sunil was carried by Fox and people like Alex Jones. The rumour started here, the end result was thousands of hate mail and death threats. Sunil had already committed suicide. Sunil was Hindu. No one listened to everyone who said that Sunil was innocent. 

4. Dr. Sarandev Bhambra who lost his career (I am afraid there are very few one armed dentists) thanks to an Islamophobic attack aimed at fighting Islamic fundies. Bhambra was a Sikh.. 

There is a major element of racism when it comes to Islamophobic people. It looks like racism, it feels like racism, and the guys who do it tend to be racist.

&gt;I saw this man in pictures a lot when Eurovision was going on here, and I have a question. He's not trans, he's a drag queen. 

Well, he's not a he when in drag, when in drag she is a woman, and specifically an artistic persona.


&gt; Why is it considered tolerant and progressive to have him on TV? 

She's not on TV to pander to some tolerance quota, she's on TV for being entertaining, hot, and a great singer. You might not find her persona interesting but a lot of people do.

&gt; It's literally a sexual fetish, 

Whut? This has nothing to do with fetishes. People watch TV personalities because they are funny, attractive, interesting, etc. She fits those.

&gt; what does it have to do with the rights of actual transgender people (or gay people, seeing as most of them aren't drag queens, obviously) to have a dude who just likes to dress up as a woman on TV? 

Because apparently people still perceive drag queens as some sexual deviancy and cannot comprehend that the drag queens can be appreciated as people regardless of how they present. Like, it's an act of being a gorgeous bearded lady. This apparently made a LOT of people angry and insecure. An artist playing loose with the definitions of femininity raised huge shit from the small minded people who like their gender roles separate.


&gt; How is that any different from inviting a guy with a raging foot fetish to host Eurovision, and having him tickle the feet of every contestant? Or a furry? 

I cannot even begin to explain to you how wrong the question is. You simply look at Conchita and see only weird sex. You cannot empathise that other people find her nice, attractive, funny or sweet. By the way she also SANG. She didn't go on stage and say ""welp I am a guy in a dress give me the win to pander to lgbtq rights"". You see a drag queen and only see the drag as if she is not a person.

A NY, non ne ho un idea perché, ma usiamo sia Turin sia Torino. Pensavo che fossero due città diversi lol XD

Comunque lo so che ti verrebbe da escludere che quelle tradotte abbiano maggiori difficoltà di pronuncia in lingua inglese, ma per Venezia, Roma, e napoli, è più facile a dirlo in inglese almeno per me. sopratutto Venezia. Ho ancora difficolta a dirlo. Non c'è quel pronuncia in inglese per 'zia'. lo direi come ""Veneh-zee-ah"". Siracusa, lo dico Syracuse anche perché c'è una Syracuse NY, quindi sono abituato a sentirlo così. Bologna dovrebbe avere un nome in inglese, non lo so se lo sapessi, ma in inglese (almeno i americani) ridano sempre quando vedono ""Bologna"" perché è [un tipo di carne](http://www.gianteagle.com/ProductImages/PRODUCT_NODE_151/44700008652.jpg) :P ma lo diciamo ""Bolo-nee""

It would be possible to change the law. It has been seriously discussed by the EU, ECB and Greek governments, and they would have been willing to amend the laws to let Greece leave, if it got to this.

&gt;Isn't that offensive to trans people, though? 

Drag queens are controversial to some people in the LGBTQ community as far as I know but to most they celebrate the freedom of being who you are, however you are.
To be foremost they are artists. Think of cabaret. Is a cabaret artist the same person as he is at home with his family? Nope. He is another person. He ""lives"" an alternative personality, reacts like one, goes on talk shows like one, has hobbies and prefferences like one. Art gives you immense freedom with certain things that seem untouchable.

Just, look what an amazing reaction Conchita made simply by being a drag queen ""with a beard"". That is all. Eurovision has seen already PLENTY of non normative people and it is a contest of being likeable to a large degree. But Conchita made one bold purely superficial change and it rippled all the way to the russian government taking a stance. What an amazing art piece. Making people react emotionally and face inner biases. That is a good reason why she is liked so much. 

And personally, I found it not even that crazy of a move. A majority of women have facial hair of some sort but everyone removes it and pretends it doesn't exist. Immesurable shame about stuff that grows naturallh from your skin as an animal. Our gender idea of a woman is something completely artificial in certain aspects. That I find far more crazy than a drag act. 

&gt; It implies all it takes to be a man or woman is clothes/wigs, etc. 

Nope, it implies all it takes to be a man or a woman is to feel deep down you are one. Hence Conchita sporting a beard to rival the ""manliest"" Viking beard and still being accepted as a ""woman"". I personally have no issue with someone having an aspect of their personality be female while 99% of the time feeling and presenting as a man. People are not end point categories.

&gt; Meanwhile trans people have to have life changing surgery, do hormone therapy, etc. They can't stop being trans when they don't feel like it, they have a mental condition, not a lifestyle preference.

Trans people are *already* the gender they identify and feel like even before life changing surgery, even before hormones, even before presenting as their inner gender. It's not about the clothes. If a 12 year old ""seemingly boy"" concludes though their own feelings and through therapy that they are a girl then they are a girl. Even if they might then go years before adjusting their appearance to fit their inner image of themselves. Even if they don't do that.

But while some trans folk transition to a very clearly identifiable gender not all do so. Some transition to a seemingly androgynous appearance (you can totally be trans and not do make up and girly clothes, after all ""boyish"" girls are still girls) and not everyone gets that life changing surgery because it is not yet a fully operational equivalent of born genitals of the opposite sex.

&gt; An artist who painted a stunning graffiti mural which has been turning heads in Sliema intends to complete the piece in northern Italy in a couple of weeks.
The four-storey high mural shows a man scrambling into a hole in a wall of a building, adjacent to the Regina car park.

&gt; Many on the way to Bisazza Street have stopped to marvel at the piece, wondering whether there is a story to the grey man in red shorts and flip-flops.
It took the French artist, who goes by the name MTO, three days to complete the mural, which formed a part of the Sliema Arts Festival.

&gt; Asked about his piece, he told this newspaper to “wait a week or two... you will understand”.
But Pierre Portelli, who chairs the festival committee, said the other part of the mural will show the man coming out of a wall in an as yet unspecified building in the north of Italy.

&gt; Nun geht es mir gar nicht darum, mich über eine Rechtschreib-Schwäche lustig zu machen.

Doch, genau darum geht es. Der Artikel suggeriert, daß eine Legasthenie irgendwie einen Rückschluß auf die vorhandene Intelligenz (oder, eigentlich ""Bildung) zulässt. Das ist natürlich Blödsinn.

&gt; Wir leben in einem Land, in dem eine hochrangige CDU-Politikern wie Erika Steinbach behauptet, die NSDAP sei eine linke Partei gewesen. Und das, obwohl das NS-Regime Kommunisten verfolgte und hinrichten ließ.

""Kommunisten verfolgen und hinrichten lassen"" und ""linke Partei sein"" schließt sich nicht gegenseitig aus. Nein, ich halte die NSDAP nicht für eine ""linke"" Partei, obwohl sie teilweise linke Politik machte.

&gt; 40 Prozent der Deutschen wissen laut einer Umfrage von 2014 nicht einmal, was der Unterschied zwischen einer Demokratie und einer Diktatur ist.

Wenn man sich die Politik der letzten 30 Jahre so anschaut (""Basta"", ""Alternativlos""), ist es nicht verwunderlich, daß die Grenzen verschwimmen. 

&gt; 19 Prozent der Befragten hatten übrigens keine Ahnung, wann die Berliner Mauer gebaut wurde.

Für die Diskussion irrelevantes Faktenwissen. 

&gt; Ob die Allgemeinbildung früher besser war, ist nicht bekannt. Solche Daten werden erst seit einigen Jahren erhoben.

Oh, das ist schon bekannt. De*x Autor*x sei die Recherche nach Jugendbüchern für 10-13-Jährige wie ""Das neue Universum"" aus den 60ern empfohlen - was da als gegeben vorausgesetzt wurde (an logischem Denken, Mathe, ...), da schlackern dem heutigen Abiturienten die Ohren. Wenn ich sehe, was heutige Abiturienten drauf haben (und was vor knapp 15 Jahren von unsereinem verlangt wurde)... da möchte man fast auswandern, um sich nicht an diese Sozialgemeinschaft binden zu müssen.

&gt; Nel 1973 smisi di fingere e presentai ai miei genitori una ragazza di nome Christine. Una settimana dopo mi trasferii a Londra e mi iscrissi ad arte drammatica. Mia madre diceva che le avevo spezzato il cuore. Era la mia integrità che mi importava. È così egoistico? È a buon mercato, però è tutto ciò che ci resta. È l'ultimo centimetro di noi che ci resta... ma in quel centimetro siamo liberi. [...] Conobbi Ruth durante la lavorazione. Ci amavamo. Vivevamo insieme e il giorno di San Valentino mi mandava le rose. Dio mio, quanto eravamo felici. Furono i tre anni più belli della mia vita.Nel 1988 ci fu la guerra e non ci furono più rose. Per nessuno. Nel 1992, dopo il colpo di stato, cominciarono ad arrestare i gay. Presero Ruth mentre era fuori a cercar da mangiare.Perché hanno tanta paura di noi?La bruciarono con delle sigarette accese e la costrinsero a fare il mio nome. Firmò una denuncia secondo cui io l'avevo sedotta. Non gliene feci una colpa. Dio l'amavo, non gliene feci una colpa. Ma lei sì. Si uccise nella sua cella. Non sopportava d'avermi tradita, d'aver rinunciato a quell'ultimo centimetro.

The PKK is a terrorist organization that has a policy of indiscriminately killing civilians. Lots of people here visit Turkey. Be glad you weren't the victims of PKK terrorism in [Taksim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55VbGvqDHCM) or [Antalya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzXuaR7aV5g). The PKK is even dangerous in [Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pey8--1csd4) and [Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc18818-jco). If you're in Istanbul, be careful letting your kids go to the [playground at a primary school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihyLwLKWs-I), because it's a target for PKK suicide attacks. This young woman was killed by a [rocket attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhGzZfk2X2o). 

Whether it's [attacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuvwnihLVsM) and killing women and children, forcing women into [rape and prostitution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m26FWdtW9SY), [European narcoterrorism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bT7P9XLJa4), or starting [forest fires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMYMRkpPe4s), the PKK continues to terrorize everyone in its path. Ever heard of a [mule bomb?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hNrDCenbVM)

The PKK has also intentionally killed thousands of Kurdish civilians as well as many Kurdish political opponents, including those arguing for greater cultural rights, autonomy, and independence. The 1980 coup eliminated the PKK's political rivals and the PKK was really able to terrorize Turkey afterward, but between 1978 and 1980, the PKK assassinated 354 people and wounded 366; all were Kurdish. The PKK isn't the “voice of the people” as some might believe, and has never been supported by a majority of Turkey's Kurds. It in fact maintains power largely through [extortion, intimidation, and murder,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ2kNfIJf9A) while [external support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRqueTXH-a8) certainly hasn't hurt.

The PKK targets hospitals, [schools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1B9OiX0_NM), [buses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aumVo_6ULPY), [school buses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5L7mLjjc1s), and worshiping places for [religious minorities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8RjfFqddWI). The PKK kills [teachers, engineers,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceHcXohUvzk) and [Kurdish students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4UovmFP1sE).

Most of the PKK's targets for terrorist attacks appear to be in Kurdish-dominated areas like [Diyarbakir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4UovmFP1sE), Batman, Van, [Bitlis,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-rLG4HC5ng) etc. Even the Kurds who haven't been directly harmed by the PKK are harmed indirectly as the PKK has been one of the main obstacles to economic development in southeast Turkey. The PKK profits from the area's underdevelopment, hence the absence of interest in investing in eastern Anatolia and contributing to its prosperity. The PKK has also been a huge obstacle to the [rule of law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF-E_Bq_ouI).

""Mitties"" sind Leute, die schlau genug sind sich nicht offen als rechts zu positionieren, aber dumm genug sich von der Hetze gegen andere mitreissen zu lassen. Mitties wählen CDU und AfD. Mitties sind verkappte Rechte. Spiesser. Die nicht-ganz-so-aber-immer-noch-hässlichen Deutschen.

Ich sage Dir was: Nicht die pöhsen Auslända sind schuld.

Was im Gange ist - und das hört sich vielleicht wie eine Verschwörungstheorie an - ist, dass (wirtschaftlich) arme Menschen (wie Du und ich und Asylbewerber) gegeneinander ausgespielt werden.

Uns wird gesagt, ""die bösen Ausländer nehmen uns den Wohstand weg!"" Woraufhin die ""Mitties"" (wie kommst Du auf so ein bescheuertes Wort?!) sagen ""HILFE DIE NEHMEN UNS DEN WOHLSTAND WEG"".

Wer sagt uns das?

Die Reichen. Die Leute, die Kriege beginnen (und durch die Rüstungsindustrie daran verdienen!). Die Leute, denen die grossen rechten Zeitungen (Springer, FAZ, NZZ, Weltwoche!) gehören. *Die Leute, die nicht wollen, dass alle merken, dass eigentlich sie schuld daran sind, dass alte Menschen Flaschen sammeln müssen - weil sie auf Kosten der Allgemeinheit immer mehr Reichtum scheffeln.*

Das gleiche mit Griechenland. Nicht die Griechen nehmen unseren Wohlstand weg. Die Kapitalisten beuten uns aus, und beuten Griechenland aus - und wiegeln dann die Deutschen gegen die Griechen und die Griechen gegen die Deutschen auf, sodass keiner merkt, was eigentlich los ist.

So läuft das. Vielleicht mal nicht gegen die hetzen, die noch schwächer sind als Du. Vielleicht mal auf die Strasse gehen gegen die, die die Macht haben (und ich rede nicht von denen, die wir gewählt haben).

Infatti sto cercando il bandolo della matassa da mezz'ora e ancora non ci arrivo (forse è troppo geniale per me?) ma se uno studente costa 10 alla scuola pubblica, laddove il contributo dello stato è 10, mentre alla paritaria il contributo del stato è 5 ed il restante 5 è a carico dello studente...il costo ricadrebbe sulla famiglia=il contribuente, e di conseguenza sarebbe necessario dimezzare il contributo fiscale destinato alla scuola per ogni contribuente, altrimenti questa geniale soluzione altro non sarebbe se non una tassa sulla scuola mascherata. D'altro canto immagino che chiunque non possa permettersi la retta dovrà comunque essere sovvenzionato giusto? Per quella clausola dell'obbligatorietà dell'istruzione...

There is an odd and contradictory reasoning mixing ""legalistic"" with ""political"" and even ""ideological reasons"" for keeping Greece in the euro despite economic good sense. Nobody today can claim that Greece was ready to join the euro.

If we apply the rules of the euro, Greece has to leave no matter what legalistic, political or ideological reasons some might invent.

Without political union, the survival of our common currency depends on respecting the commonly agreed rules. If Greece is allowed to stay, the increasing violation of the rules cannot but destroy the euro and the EU in the long run.

An dieser Stelle fällt mir immer das berühmte Känguru-Zitat ein..

&gt; Augenscheinlich eine Frage, aber heute darf man so etwas nicht mehr Fragen ohne gleich wieder den Textkrieg zw. Links und Rechts loszutreten,

Ganz einfach: Weil die Frage kompletter Schwachsinn ist und nix mit Asylrecht zu tun hat, trotzdem von den Rechten (insbesondere der NPD) sehr gerne als Argument gegen Flüchtlingsaufnahme genommen wird: Es ist rechte Propaganda.

&gt; Sicher gibt es unter den Dutzenden von Flüchtlingen auch vereinzelte die Mist bauen, sicher gibt’s auch vereinzelt welche die Herkommen weil ihr Land nicht das reichste ist.

Jop, gibts. Weil Asylanten auch nur Menschen sind, die Mist bauen, genauso wie wir Deutschen das tun. Aber auch das ist kein Argument gegen Flüchtlinge, wie die Rechten das gerne versuchen. Das ist der Punkt. Die ""Mitties"" halten sich zwar gerne für unvoreingenommen, fallen aber unglaublich leicht auf rechte Hetze hinein. Deshalb ist ja auch der ""Ich bin nicht rechts, aber..""-Satz so unglaublich verhöhnt. Natürlich sind die Verfasser dieses Satzes nicht rechts, aber man weiß, dass auf diesen Satz irgendeine rechte Scheisse folgt. Nicht, weil diese Menschen jemandem was Böses wollen, sie wissen es einfach nicht besser.

Und zuletzt nochmal eine kleine Frage abseits vom Thema:

&gt; Mitties sind Stolz auf das Land in dem Sie Leben.

Warum? Abseits von Fußball, natürlich? Was hast du in deinem Leben getan, dass du stolz auf dieses Land sein könntest, was hast du zu diesem Land beigetragen was du nicht in jedem anderen Land auch tun müsstest? Bist du Bundestagsabgeordneter? Volksheld? Das sind die einzigen Gründe die mir einfallen, stolz auf Deutschland zu sein, denn so funktioniert stolz. Ich bin stolz darauf, bei der Feuerwehr zu sein, weil es etwas ist wozu ich mich entschlossen habe und was anderen Menschen nützt und was eine gute Sache ist. Aber ich habe mich nicht dazu entschieden Deutscher zu sein, es nützt anderen Menschen nichts dass ich es bin und es ist keine schlechtere Sache als jede andere Nationalität auch.

null,false,inadaptado,null,null,null,"Hello there. I've had a fair share of bus rides, so let's see if I can help you:

* Is this normal, or was I experiencing a glitch?

Transportation companies sometimes offer lower prices if you buy online. Nonetheless, ALSA is a pretty big company and they use different routes at different times of the day, and each trip has a different cost even if they all arrive at the same destination (price depends on availability, if they use highways or not, etc...).

* Would it be better to talk to an actual person in the ticket booth?

It would be a good idea to ask them before making any decision. Fair warning: Approach them when there is nobody else waiting to buy a ticket or otherwise they might rush you off.

* The station had an Alsa office, should I talk to them?

Better not, those offices are usually not open to the public (if there is actually someone there), and even if you get in there they will probably tell you to ask in the ticket booth anyway.

* BusPlus

As far as I know it's just a simple rewards card: with each trip they give you points that you can exchange for discounts on other trips, but the only direct discount they seem to offer is a 5% when you top up a VISA BusPlus for more than 100€. There are two cards: the ordinary one, which is not even a real card (you just sign up and then show your ID on the ticket booth to get your points), and the VISA one, which is a physical card and might take a few days to arrive wherever you are staying. If you are going to take a few ALSA rides you could sign up for the ordinary one, since even though you might not get enough points for a discount it does have a few advantages like free changes and cancellations on your trips, which is neat. But I don't think the VISA one is worth it.

EDIT: About foreigners having problems with credit cards at bus booth tickets... it's not only foreigners. When I buy a bus ticket I always pay cash because I've found too many booths without dataphones, or that just didn't work.

No, we don't need to change the laws. Greece can leave the EU and the euro any time under Art. 50.  If the laws are applied Greece cannot stay in the euro because the ECB is not allowed to fund bankrupt banks. If Greek banks cannot get euros, Greece will have to print a parallel currency, which automatically places Greece outside the euro because under ECB rules parallel currencies are not allowed.

The bottom line is that under current law, Greece cannot stay in the euro.

Ich lese immer, dass Deutschland die Schuld trägt an der Gewalt von Zuwanderern aber gibt es überhaupt einen Staat auf der Welt, der solche Probleme nicht hat?

Frankreich, England, Niederlande, Schweden sind z.B. andere Länder, die genau die gleichen Probleme wie Deutschland haben oder sogar noch schlimmer.

Ich denke das Problem liegt an der Masse und an der Kultur der Zuwanderer. Wie ich schon ein paar mal gesagt habe, gibt es bestimmte Gruppen, die sich praktisch überall gut Integrieren wie z.B. Ostasiaten. Gibt es ein westliches Land, das ernsthafte Probleme mit Vietnamesen oder Thais hat? Mit Afrikanern und Arabern sieht das anders aus. Da muss etwas in der Kultur liegen, die Integration erschwert.

Und sowas wird man nur los, wenn Migranten in ein komplett deutsches Umfeld gebracht werden. Sobald sich grüppchen bilden, hat man keine Chance mehr. Aber ist bei der Masse der Migranten nicht möglich. Ein Sozialarbeiter 2 mal im Monat ist absolut nutzlos. Wenn der kleine sieht wie Mutti regelmäßg Schläge einsteckt und er selber auch, dann braucht es einiges um das rauszukriegen.

Eine kleine Hoffnung wäre vielleicht wesentlich(!) härter mit Polizei durchzugreifen. Mit einem hartem aber fairem Gefängniss und Resolzialisierungssystem gibt es vielleicht eine kleine Chance da etwas aufzubrechen aber in Deutschland wird es ja als Katastrophe angesehen, wenn ein Schläger oder Vergewaltiger mehr als 3-4 Jahre in den Knast muss, also wird es auch nicht passieren.


Insgesamt sehe ich es als sicher an, dass die Probleme mit Migranten nur wachsen werden. Die Linke hat zwar in ein paar Punkten recht (Integration in die Arbeitswelt ist extrem wichtig), ist aber in anderen einfach extrem naiiv. Diskriminierung ist garantiert nicht der Hauptgrund wieso ein Migrant jemanden niedersticht oder vergewaltigt.

Für Deutschland am besten wäre IMO:

1. Weniger ungebildete Migranten vor allem von Gruppen, die sich schwer integrieren lassen
2. Massiv versuchen die Migranten in die Arbeitswelt zu holen

Only the latter one should be a reason, since this sub is about geographical Europe. There are other countries which are not christian, don't speak a slavic/romance/germanic language or have a population that migrated from somewhere far away a couple of centuries ago. The real question should be whether Istanbul is enough to be considered European. The EU seems to be willing to have talks s with them about accession and they join us in other associations as well (e.g. UEFA, Eurovision). If not Turkey then I don't feel we really should have the countries in the Caucasus either.

Damit meinte ich, dass man nicht die Kapitalisten als Feind nehmen soll, sondern den Kapitalismus oder das System. Ich will damit die Elite etwas in Schutz nehmen.

Es muss geschehen, wenn du Armut und soziale Spaltung verhindern willst. Und konsequent gedacht wollen ja Rechte und Linke dies. Die meisten Menschen wollen eine sozial ausgeglichene Gesellschaft.

&gt; Es wird also nicht primär der Kapitalismus bekämpft, sondern die Kapitalisten. In diesem Weltbild steht einer ""bösen"" KapitalistInnenklasse eine ""gute"" ArbeiterInnenklasse gegenüber und es genügt, wenn die ArbeiterInnenklasse der KapitalistInnenklasse das Kapital und die Produktionsmittel entreißt. In der konkreten politischen Arbeit dieser Gruppierungen heißt das dann, daß es genügt sich auf die Seite der ArbeiterInnenklasse zu stellen und ihr zu ihrem Recht zu verhelfen.  

&gt; 
&gt; Wiederum wird nur die Sphäre der Zirkulation und nicht jene der Produktion hinterfragt, Kapitalismus nur als ""Verteilungsproblem"" wahrgenommen in dem einige ""bösartige Reiche"" den ""armen Ausgebeuteten"" ihren gerechten Lohn vorenthalten. Dieselbe Argumentationsweise findet sich aber nicht nur in der klassischen Linken, sondern auch in einer Reihe von KonzernbekämpferInnen aller Art. Da wird etwa Mc Donals als Einzelfeindbild bekämpft gegen das Kundgebungen und Demonstrationen organisiert werden. Niemand kommt auf die Idee, daß Mc Donalds nur die erfolgreichere Variante von Schnitzelhaus Pizza Hut und dem Würstelstand um die Ecke darstellt.

Description from the movie:  

This footage was not recorded in Iraq or Syria ... this happened in Debrecen, Hungary
Since the beginning of 2015 an unprecedented number of illegal immigrants arrived in Hungary. Today Hungary is a primary route for illegal immigrants in to the European Union. More than 75 000 immigrants arrived in Hungary illegally this year alone, Hungary has the highest number of incoming immigrants per citizen. At this rate, the number of illegals will reach the population of a medium sized city by the year's end.
In Debrecen the number of illegal immigrants reached more than twice the capacity of the migrant camp in a matter of weeks. A religious fight broke out at the camp between two groups of illegal immigrants, which then spilled out on to the neighboring streets. The enraged illegal immigrants attacked passing cars, and set trash cans on fire.
This is the reason Hungary is building a fence on its border with Serbia: to protect the people of Hungary and the people of Europe.

&gt; You will be using goods and services created by immigrant labour because British people don't want kids but still want the quality of life of a modern economy. And you're going to need immigrants for as long as people don't want kids. Also, our mathematics, science, philosophy and arts come from Greece, Rome, medieval Arabs, Iranians, Indians, mainland Europe and north America. You're reading this in a language from Scandinavia using letters from Italy, words from French/German/Greek and numbers from India.

None of those things are products of multiculturalism, they're products of globalisation, except for foreign restaurants and he's right about there being no need for a Chinese chef to cook Chinese food, or and Indian one to cook a curry.

Wenn zwei das Gleiche tun, ist es aber noch lange nicht dasselbe, und es lässt sich auch nicht losgelöst vom Kontext betrachten.

&gt;„Wieso müssen unsere Alten eigtl. Flaschen sammeln um über die Runden zu kommen und die Asylanten bekommen alles?“

Was man für Fragen stellt, sagt eben auch was über einen selbst aus. Hier z.B. die Sprachwahl (""[Asylanten](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylbewerber)""), die Annahme, dass Asylbewerber ""alles bekommen"" und dass Alte und Asylbewerber in ein Konkurrenzverhältnis gesetzt werden. Man hätte ja auch fragen können ""Wieso verdienen einige Leute hunderttausende oder Millionen von Euro im Jahr und andere müssen Flaschen sammeln"" oder ""Warum müssen die einen 60-Stunden-Wochen schieben und andere finden keine Arbeit?"" oder ""Warum dürfen Europäer überall hinreisen, Afrikaner aber nicht?"".

&gt;Das z.B. die Propaganda der heilen Welt der Linken, dass alle Asylanten Nett und Brav sind, nicht stimmt.

Dass Linke dies behaupten, wäre mir neu. Wenn mir jemand einen Beleg liefern kann, dass das wirklich eine verbreitete Position in der Linken ist, bitte her damit.

Some did. Others just ended up being isolated, or they had diaspora communities with a strong enough support network that they didn't need to learn the language. It's always been like this. My neighbour's father was a coal miner in Belgium in the 1930s. He and his family were there for 15 years and his wife came back knowing exactly one word of Dutch. Walk into any urban ethnic enclave and you'll find people that don't speak much of any language but their mother tongue. If you don't provide affordable language services to immigrants, some will just never be able to pick up the language and you have no right to complain about it if you're not willing to do anything about it.

In my experience, there are no immigrants that just refuse to learn the language. It just doesn't happen. People just don't appreciate how difficult it is to learn a new language. Fist of all, it's not a question of motivation for a lot of people, it's that they don't know how to approach language learning, which is why live language instruction is so vital. And secondly, there is a dire lack of actually useful resources for a lot of smaller European languages. Take Slovenian, for example - our language learning resources are overwhelmingly geared towards speakers of English. How does that help an Albanian family where no one speaks English, for example? It's not as easy as hitting the books. Not everyone is Kató Lomb. And also, language classes are great for forming social networks that prevent social isolation.

Das ist die [??], eine ziemlich schöne Gegend zwischen Bayern, Thüringen und Essen. Und da gibt's Ecken, da stehen also [??] Kühe, und da gibt's andere Ecken, da stehen solche Bäumchen, das sind Holunderbäumchen. Und an diesen Holunderbäumchen in dieser Plantage wachsen Holunderdolden. (Über?) der Ente  werden diese Dolden abgeschnitten, mit so einer Schere. (Über?)der Ernte braucht man eine ganze Menge Erntehilfe, das machen viele Leute, die helfen damit, und am schnellsten kann das Frau Ritter, die hier gehört mit der Plantage. 
Diese ganze Dolden werden erstmal in einen Eimer geworfen, und dann kommt Lukas, weil Lukas gerade Schulferien hat, darf er mithelfen. Der darf schon so ein (Radlager?) fahren, vorne mit 'ner [Wande?] darauf. 
In diese [Wande?] werden die ganzen Holunderdolden gekippt, aber bis die (Wande) voll ist, das dauert die ganze Weile. Hier sieht man die Beere nochmal ganz kurz, und wir schauen erst mal woandershin. Da kommt gerade ein Anhänger, und der kippt Getreide ab, das ist in diesem Fall Gärste. Die Gärste fällt hier durch so ein Gitter, und so sieht denn ein einzelnes  Gärstenkorn aus, aber so kann (noch nicht wieder mitmachen?), deswegen fallen die gesamten Gärstenkörner zunächst mal in ein riesiges [???], und da ist Wasser drinnen und dadurch werden die Gärstenkörner natürlich nass, ist ja klar? Das Wasser hat aber nur einen anderen Zweck. Nämlich mit diesem Wassen werden die nassen Gärstenkörner jetzt eine Etage tiefer befördert, in so ein grosses Becken. Der Boden von dem Becken ist ein grosses Sieb. Das Wasser kann nach unten ablaufen und nur die nassen Gärstenkörner bleiben oben draufliegen
Und weil es in dem Haufen warm wird, tun die das, was die Natur draussen machen würde; sie bilden Keime. Da ist wieder unser einzelnes Gärstenkorn. Damit der Keim raus kann, öffnet sich die Hölle. Damit der überhaupt wachsen kann, [?] sich im Gärstenkorn Malzzucker. Der lässt dieser Keim wachsen.

You also seem to have a very static view on what is culture. It's not like *Dutch culture* is some homogenous whole where all our cultural productions descend from.

Since culture is continuously  influenced by events all over the world, the culture (I'm speaking of culture in the plural now) changes everyday.

Das ist die [Rhön], eine ziemlich schöne Gegend zwischen Bayern, Thüringen und Essen. Und da gibt's Ecken, da stehen [an so Berghängen] Kühe, und da gibt's andere Ecken, da stehen solche Bäumchen, das sind Holunderbäumchen. Und an diesen Holunderbäumchen in dieser Plantage wachsen Holunderdolden. [Und bei] der Ente werden diese Dolden abgeschnitten, mit so einer Schere. (Bei )der Ernte braucht man eine ganze Menge Erntehilfe, das machen viele Leute, die helfen damit, und am schnellsten kann das Frau Ritter, die hier gehört mit der Plantage. Diese ganze Dolden werden erstmal in einen Eimer geworfen, und dann kommt Lukas [ins Spiel], weil Lukas gerade Schulferien hat, darf er mithelfen. Der darf schon so ein [Radlager] fahren, vorne mit 'ner [Wanne] darauf. In diese [Wanne] werden die ganzen Holunderdolden gekippt, aber bis die [Wanne] voll ist, das dauert die ganze Weile. Hier sieht man die Beeren nochmal ganz [gut], und wir schauen erst mal woandershin. Da kommt gerade ein Anhänger, und der kippt Getreide ab, das ist in diesem Fall Gerste. Die Gerste fällt hier durch so ein Gitter, und so sieht denn ein einzelnes Gerstenkorn aus, aber so kann [noch nicht viel damit machen], deswegen fallen die gesamten Gerstenkörner zunächst mal in ein [diesen Bottich], und da ist Wasser drinnen und dadurch werden die Gärstenkörner natürlich nass, ist ja klar? Das Wasser hat aber nur einen anderen Zweck. Nämlich mit diesem Wassen werden die nassen Gerstenkörner jetzt eine Etage tiefer befördert, in so ein grosses Becken. Der Boden von dem Becken ist ein grosses Sieb. Das Wasser kann nach unten ablaufen und nur die nassen Gerstenkörner bleiben oben daraufliegen [und bilden so einen Haufen] Und weil es in dem Haufen warm wird, tun die das, was die Natur draussen machen würde; sie bilden Keime. Da ist wieder unser einzelnes Gerstenkorn. Damit der Keim raus kann, öffnet sich die Hölle. Damit der überhaupt wachsen kann, [bildet] sich im Gerstenkorn Malzzucker. Der lässt dieser Keim wachsen. Und dieser Malzzucker ist genau das, was man haben will. 

Ergänzt :) und bis 3:34 weiter gemacht:
Wenn also genügend Malzzucker in diesen Körnern drin ist, werden sie mit so einer Förderschnecke transportiert, fallen eine Etage tiefer in einen Trockenraum und durch das Trocknen wird das Wachsen der Keime gestoppt. Das dauert ein paar Tage und deswegen schauen wir erst einmal weiter was mit unseren Hollunderbeeren passiert. Diese Wanne voll geernteter Hollunderbeeren wird in so einen Trichter gekippt. Am unteren Ende dieses Trichters ist eine Schnecke, die drückt die ganzen Beeren mit allem drum und dran nach unten durch ein Loch in eine zweite Kiste. Und in dieser zweiten Kiste werden die Beeren entrappt, so nennt man das, also die ganzen Stengel und Stiele werden abgemacht,die kommen hier an der Seite raus und übrig bleiben, im anderen Bottich, nur die Beeren und natürlich der Saft. Und auf den kommt es an, den wollen wir haben. Und damit der nun nicht schlecht wird, dieser Saft, wird er als nächstes erhitzt in diesen Röhren. Das passiert in einem sogenannten Wasserbad und wie muss man sich das vorstellen? Das ist ungefähr so als würde man auf einen Herd eine Schüssel mit Wasser stellen, in diese Schüssel eine zweite Schüssel hinein und dahinein kommen die Hollunderbeeren mit dem Saft.

Misattribution of quotes is a problem, and I won't use the one like above again.

Splendid! Nothing turns a community as fast into a shit-fest as that.

Do carry on with the bright ideas. I have been a moderator in a similar, if somewhat rougher, multi-national community. Only in the most extreme cases does community control over the mods make any sense - any community like this is composed of a lot of factions which will start battling against each other the moment they have any say over the moderation.

We could begin paying the mods (via flattr or something), then we have a reasonable cause to demand they take even more of their time to argue with users. But please don't lure people who do the job in their spare time into the morass user-control usually is.

b) Since there is no explicit provision regarding EMU exit, it cannot be violated by a Grexit.

c) There is no explicit EMU exit clause because every currency needs the ""presumption of perpetuity"". Your banknote will not be worth anything today if you admit that it won't have any value tomorrow. However, that ""presumption"" doesn't mean that all currencies will exist into all eternity.

La guerre civile en Syrie avait déjà démarré depuis quelques mois. Une équipe de reporters était partie à la frontière turque pour faire un très beau reportage sur les réfugiés coincés côté syrien. Juste après il y avait un reportage anecdotique sur une collectivité avec des chèvres. Je ne me souviens plus exactement mais c'était un sujet éco. Le lendemain matin le rédacteur en chef du soir est venu voir le journaliste qui avait réalisé le reportage sur les chèvres pour le féliciter, expliquant qu'il avait le nez collé aux courbes d'audience et que tout au long du reportage sur la Syrie ça dégringolait, jusqu'à ce que ses chèvres arrivent et que tout à coup c'est remonté. Son reportage n'était pas mauvais en soi, ni même exempt d'informations mais ça m'avait tout de même serré la gorge.

Si tu regarde le nombre de ""vue"" sur la plupart des articles qui font du journalisme dit sérieux, tu n'as pas besoin d'être polytechnicien ou d'avoir fait ""des analyses statistiques"" pour te rendre compte qu'ils sont moins lus que les trucs plus clickbaits. Tu peux te bercer d'illusions et considérer que tous ceux qui s'en plaignent décortiquent XXI, qu'ils lisent Le Monde diplomatique et n'écoutent que les journaux de France Culture mais je doute que ce soit le cas. Et puisque tu parles de statistiques auxquelles je n'ai pas accès, j'aimerais bien savoir combien de ces zorros du clavier *payent* pour leurs informations. Une information de qualité à un coût, les articles de qualité du Monde (pour rester sur cet exemple, il y en a beaucoup d'autres en France comme à l'étranger) sont souvent payants.  

Cela étant dit ces articles sont accessibles. France 3 continue de faire des reportages sur la Syrie en plus d'en faire sur les chèvres.

Je suis pas juriste, peut-être que le mail suffit, maintenant qu'ils t'ont répondu. En tout cas, pour les étapes importantes (genre ""maintenant, rendez-moi mon argent, vous me devez XXX €"") ça vaut le coup de le faire en AR.

Ma tante (en tant que propriétaire avec des locataires abusifs) avait fait l'erreur d'écrire que des lettres simples (c'était avant que tout le monde ait un mail), auxquelles le locataire n'avait toujours répondu que par téléphone, genre super conciliant. Devant le juge (parce que le locataire avait sérieusement endommagé le logement), il a simplement affirmé n'avoir jamais été prévenu... Et le juge (qui n'était certainement pas dupe) n'a pu que constater que ma tante n'avait aucune preuve de ce qu'elle disait.

Là, vu que tu as un échange (ils ont répondu, donc ils ont lu), c'est peut-être plus acceptable en cas de vrai conflit. Mais ça peut valoir le coup d'envoyer une lettre avec AR disant en gros ""vu l'état des lieux, vu le bail, je ne vous doit plus rien, vous devez me rendre tant d'argent, maintenant payez"".

When you say this

&gt; So for example as a czech I really don't expect american or greek imigrant to learn czech, he already respect the same values,

Many Hispanics in the US don't learn English, but the values are the same. Instead of them adapting to society, an entire country had to adapt to those who didn't want to learn English. It becomes a problem. That's not integration in any way shape or form. That's just moving to another country and saying ""hey, I'm part of it"". You're not integrated, you just live there.

Here in Slovakia, I can name holidays. I can talk about it's history. I know the language. I know my neighbors down the street, and I can talk with them because there's no language barrier. I can tell you how to get to places all over the country. I pay attention to politics. I am as active with this country as I was with the US. I pay attention to everything because Slovakia is now my home. I respect it as much as I do the US, and if it came down to it, I'd fight for Slovakia as I would for the US. That is integration. Yes, cultures and values are part of it, but are exactly that, just a part of it. Integration is when you make your new place of living your actual home, and take in everything that comes with it.

Just because someone has the same values or accepts his new locations values, doesn't mean he's integrated at all. It just means he tolerates his new home. Same with just knowing the language.

It looked like another slow news week, since this is the month when most of us finns take our summer vacations and head to our cabins. Still some shit went down.

-A 57-year old social worker was murdered up north by teenagers. 

-A member of the parliament (guess of which party) made a facebook post about the horrors of multiculturalism. This caused a shit storm to which everybody has had something to say. My personal favorite was Stubbs tweet ""Multiculturalism is a richness. I have nothing else to say."". The only one left speachless is Timo Soini, head of the Finns Party.

-This week has also been cold and wet.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; Another question, did Domobrani ever fight Ustase, due to different views of violence against civilians, such as inner conflict?

As far as I could read, there weren't outright fights among them, after all they all served under NDH. But there were incidents, especially in East Bosnia, where Domobrani tried to protect the Serbs. And they never really approved of savage practices that Ustashe employed. Of course this doesn't mean that Domobrani didn't commit crimes or that they didn't participate in anti-Jewish and anti-Serbian hysteria. There were all kinds of people there.

&gt; Did any refuse to fight for NDH therefor?

Speaking from personal experience of my family - Yes. There was also a forced Croatisation, for example my grandfather, a Serb, was abducted, listed as a Croat and forced to serve in Domobrani, he escaped after two days. Now, you can imagine he wasn't the exception, who knows how many Serbs, Bosniaks, Hungarians, Slovenians, Slovaks were forced to serve in Domobrani and you can imagine what their relationship with it was. My grandmother, along with my late uncle and my late father, who were babies at the time were saved by two Domobrani. It's kinda funny story, funny and terrifying. Basically as I understand, Domobrani later were mandatory army, and if you were Croat and you weren't Ustasha, you had to be in Domobrani. This composition made it so, that there was more ""normal"" people in Domobrani, who didn't really want to kill all the Jews and Serbs, but were forced to serve as NDH army. Also, as far as I could read, Domobrani were much more likely to deflect to Partisans.",null,0,null,1437905221,null,0,1437905586,0,ctgjyef,null,t3_3ek5yi,null,t1_ctgjyef,null,t1_ctgcnsy,null,null,null,1440092257,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Sure one can come to the conclusion that a reduced immigration would reduce also acts of crime, however that doesn't address the underlying issue, which is bikers playing war in average neighbourhoods and little (read not enough) law enforcement intervention. When Italy went through public bombings those years were called ""the years of lead"", leaving a deep imprint in people's memories, so it's not a thing that is really common abroad.

null,false,ThatOtherAndy,UKGB,United Kingdom,null,"Okay chief I've got some advice for you if you're going to be the public mouthpeice of this movement here on reddit.

First of all you're not on twitter, ending posts in a hashtag makes you sound obnoxious and amateurish. I get that you're trying to raise brand awareness or whatever but the brand awareness you're promoting is one of 'Oh it's these twitter bellends poncing around on reddit.' just be aware of that fact.

Second denigration is never an efficient tool to win popular support. Telling people how shit and insignificant their country is is counter productive as it raises nationalist sentiment as people get defensive. No one likes being described as a pygmy particularly if they don't believe it themselves - the world's sixth tallest man isn't a dwarf just because there are five people taller than him. EU positives have to be the overwhelming majority of your campaign rather than the 'You're nothing alone.' approach, also the EU = peace in our time doesn't really fly with the British public.

Third you tone is caught somewhere between formal letter (which is what I think you're going for) and university essay. I get that you're trying to differentiate yourselves from the average joe public  comments but again your tone is off it comes across as disingenuous and artificial. Case in point, don't put your buzzwords in italics. We're not stupid we can see alliteration you don't have to point out the fact that you had a brainstorming session to come up with the 3 e's. Also be aware of how much buzzwords are a turn off to people who are disenchanted with politics in the age of spin.

Be honest, Be earnest, Be real. (See I learned about the rule of 3 in Year 9 too)

Don't be afraid of facts even if they go against you sometimes, nobody trusts North Korea's 99.7% turnout and they won't trust a campaign that tells them the EU is 100% a positive for the UK with no downsides whatsoever. Be prepared to admit that the is room for improvement when there is, it will win you more support in the long run than denying any problems whatsoever.

Be prepared to argue you case with people who disagree with you. Many people are concerned and have reservations but there are relatively few dyed in the wool europhobes who can never be convinced. Make you case and crucially if you're on the internet don't simply dismiss people who disagree, people's concerns are valid to them and there will be many people who share similar concerns regarding the EU. It either looks like you're running away or you're out of touch with real people. If you make your case well even if you don't win over your direct target but you may win round some observers.

And finally do your best to avoid being perceived as ivory tower activists, real people don't like politicking and as I said earlier are very wary of spin and the language that pervades modern politics. Think more Roosevelt's fire side chats and less Alastair Campbell.

Arudas tried to paint the picture that America is undergoing some evil multicultural metamorphosis where race traitors forced the mixing of neighborhoods through legal measures, such that every white neighborhood had a quota of ~~untermensch~~ ~~filthy niggers~~ minorities who 100% were forced to live there or else the evil leftists would come and deport the god-fearing, racially pure, non-multicultural white victims of immigration to gulags in Alaska (though, to be frank, that might be too cruel - I wouldn't send anyone to alaska).

The truth is, the suburbs are predominantly white, as a product of largely discriminatory housing practices in the 50s and 60s, among other factors; blacks tend to congregate in the cities for a number of historical reasons, meaning that rural america is also predominantly white. While Mexican immigrants (and children of immigrants) can be found everywhere as migrant workers, particularly in the southwest, they almost always form an underclass of underpaid and legally-dubious residents.

The definition of a minority isn't ""an oddity"", it's tied into power structures and economic and political dependency. The blacks who lived in Harlem in the 30s, 40s and 50s certainly weren't an oddity, and helped to define American (beyond black) culture during that time period, permanently changing the course of music and culture in America. The Hungarians and Czechs who lived in Austria-Hungary were, arguably, a minority, but they weren't oddities.

When I say an oddity, I mean that there are areas of America where ""white flight"" and other demographic trends have enabled white Americans to isolate themselves from minority culture such that minorities aren't a local issue, they aren't people that locals deal with on a day to day basis - they're a national plague, subhuman talking points to be referenced on the local right-wing news station. 

For a personal example of how all this applies, my hometown in rural America is almost entirely white. Minorities are few and far between, and serve largely to staff the occasional ethnic restaurant. There's a campground near my house that, in the summers, services Black Christian revivals, which easily quintuples the Black population of my town for a few weeks. When I drive through what counts as ""down town"", the people I see are white, the shop owners are white, the pimple-faced teenagers staffing the pharmacy counters are white. White people have more than enough presence to fill a Stormfront pamphlet of the ideal neighborhood. My sister, who goes to school locally? All her friends are white, all of her church is white. She has one black friend, and he's basically white.

The immigration situation in Europe and neighbouring regions is in a state of mess. North Africa, Sahel and the Middle East are increasingly unstable regions with a massively growing population in many countries. There's war in North Africa, war in Ukraine, war in the Middle East, frozen conflicts in Transnistria and the Caucasus, economic hardship and uncertainty and a growing young population in many of these regions. It has lead to disaster and it's only going to get worse in the coming decades. Regions bordering Europe are unstable and the EU has no answers to these problems. I suspect we'll just wait and see the problems become worse and worse and create a fortress Europe in the end.

Providing family planning and birth control to many of these regions would be a cheap way to prevent problems in the future. The population growth trends in the Sahel, for example, are simply unsustainable and will lead to problems. We could help them now instead of paying more for it in the future.

You just have to pay more attention and work just a little bit more. For example, if you do the approach at an angle to counter the cross wind rather than slipping (which is uncomfortable especially for passengers, airliners don't do that for that reason) you have to align the airplane with the runway at just before the moment of touchdown - too soon and you get blown away, too late and the wheels won't be pointing down the runway.

With full flaps the approach speed is lower (closer to the minimum flying speed) and the air resistance is higher. In case of a sudden drop in speed (due to varying winds), the speed might actually get into the ""too low"" area easier since the margin is lower.

Du meinst die Nazi Vergleiche? Die sehr wohl begründet waren, da zu der Zeit in der Übergangsregierung viele Posten an die Rechtsextremen vergeben wurden.

He hated that and blamed it on their stupidity.

It explains why he used suppression, because he knew without suppression his political views could not rule. He describes in the book how he plans to control the masses and that only the masses are important, not the individual, to gain political power (since he already made the experience he couldnt convince individuals).

Et pas un centime de plus. S'ils te font payer la totalité de la taxe, ils sont en tort.** Vu la somme indiquée, ça me paraît possible.

- Concernant l'argent remis par la CAF, je comprends pas trop : normalement la CAF paye pour la durée de location, ni plus ni moins. Elle a donc dû verser, même si c'est en retard, 4 mois d'allocation logements, et ceux-ci sont normalement entièrement dûs au proprio. Sauf... si ton proprio t'a forcé à payer des loyers complets en attendant que la CAF paye sa part (ce qui est probablement illégal). Qu'en est-il ?

- Pour la caution par contre, là c'est bien ton pognon et tu es en droit de le récupérer. D'après ce que je vois sur leur fiche de remboursement, ils doivent te rembourser les réparations non-mentionnées à l'état des lieux, la majoration de 10% du loyer (complètement illégale), et probablement le ménage (puisqu'il n'est pas fait mention sur l'état des lieux de sortie que tu aurais rendu l'appartement sale). Pour moi, ils te doivent au moins 405,62€. Peut-être un peu plus s'ils t'ont aussi arnaqué sur la taxe ordures ménagères.


Je rejoins myc sur le fait qu'il faut leur mettre la pression : c'est précisément parce que tu ne veux pas aller en justice qu'il faut les en menacer et te montrer procédurière. Tu envoies des réclamations sur un ton ferme et assez ""officiel"" (on peut t'aider), précisant quelles dépenses sont illégales et pourquoi, en précisant les articles de loi concernés (là encore, on peut t'aider).

Je peux dire, il émet une critique de la métaphysique (et de l'optimiste Leibniz du ""tout va pour le mieux dans le meilleur des monde"", la metaphysique est empreinte de divin) c'est la traduction de ""question trop perchées""   
&gt;ça veut dire l'inverse de ce que tu veux lui faire dire  

C'est là tout le jeu, s'approprier la culture, se rappeler qu'il n'existe pas qu'une interprétation en science humaine, sinon comment les débats pourraient exister ? confronter les points de vue, diversifier ses approches des questions. Si nous possédons toutes les réponses en nous, à quoi servent les autres ?
j'interprète cultivons notre jardin par : c'est veiller à l'épanouissement, vouloir aller vers le bien-être, le mieux-ètre, s'interroger sur le monde et son fonctionnement, amorcer la critique de ce qui peut ètre améliorable. ça rejoins votre propos et mon propos : 
&gt;il n'est pas sain de laisser place à un vide spirituel  

Le vide spirituel,quelque part c'est inverse du ""il faut cultiver notre jardin"",c'est laisser  -pour garder un jargon agricole- sa propre sphère spirituelle en jachère.  
Spirituel, ce n'est pas un mot religieux qui est forcément associé au divin.  
&gt;C'était aussi la conclusion des lumières.

Oui,par le doute on avance, par la connaissance on s'élève (on s'extrait de nos préjugés par ce procédé). Les lumière voulait la lumière dans toutes les tètes et toutes les chaumières. ça passe par la culturation et la curiosité, la démarche des lumières s'oppose à ce que Salman  Rushdie qualifie de ""lieux de certitudes"" et ""éternelles vérités"".  
et enfin, 
connais toi toi même, la racine de la philosophie grecque, c'est aussi l'amorce de toute réflexion, comment comprendre autrui si on ignore qui on est ? s'interroger sur soi et bien se regarder en face est un exercice difficile, n'avez vous jamais vécu de situation où vous avez été surpris de votre propre réaction ? c'est ça le jeu, se connaitre soi même, se regarder en face, il faut du courage et de la volonté.   
Je suis d'accord après que les grecs n'y associaient pas non plus l'idée de dieu.

Many officials have since come to the conclusion that young drivers need more driving experience before they get the license. This would mean that getting ones drivers license would take longer. So in that sense I guess agree with ya'll.

The media is fine too, it tends to be activists who add aliases to these things and it sort of depends what gets popular as to how it is referred to. Especially when it is a change that isn't done through primary legislation, but a modification of a process or secondary legislation or whatever.. It's hardly new, or unique to the anglosphere either, it's relatively common in Germany at the very least, and I would bet elsewhere. I'm pretty certain that if you look at controversial legislation in most countries it will have been dubbed with a term that is biased one way or another..  In the context of 'cassies law' it came from activism, it was pushed by a campaign using the name and so on, so it makes sense to report on it that way, For things like the snoopers charter, the term is simply what it ended up being most commonly known as (and so that gets added to the description - the 'so called snoopers charter' etc...

null,false,lanxt,null,null,null,"""Oben"" and ""Unten"" are the basic ways of saying up and down, however you are right and there are many quite specific instances, let me deconstruct a little bit all the examples you gave to give you a better understanding of them. 

**Herauf/Hinauf**: Before anything the word ""auf"" by itself means on, not up, as in ""auf dem Tisch"" would mean on the Table. The other part of those words are the adverbs ""her""/""hin"" the first one specifies an action is taking place from some place to the present location and the latter one means something is happening from your location to some other place, quite similar to from and to in English. Those words are REALLY SPECIFIC since they are describing some action either took place FROM a specific location leaving you ON something or TO a specific location leaving you ON something. 
Example: Etwas fiel vom Balkon auf die Straße hinunter. Meaning something fell from a balcony to the street and implying you were on the balcony (hin means from here to there), and Etwas fiel vom Balkon auf die Straße herunter meaning the same but implying you are on the street (her means from there to here). 

Now the other instance you mention is ""**nach oben**"" is more simple, it means upwards (more literally translated as ""to the up"").
Example: ""Ich kann nicht nach Oben gucken"" meaning ""I can't look upwards"". 

I know the explanation is really complicated and those are just some examples but that's just the way it is. Hope I didn't scare you. If it helps just wanna say I don't remember ever studying that at all, I just learned the definition of the adverbs and prepositions and eventually by listening them in context you learn to use them all.

null,false,100100145,BULG,Bulgaria,null,"&gt;Ukraine has only symbolic support from outside.

No it doesn't. It has as much support as it requires, no more no less. The reason why they only get token support nowadays is that they the war is actually going on pretty well for them strategically. The Russians have been contained in Crimea and the Donbass. The only thing Ukraine lost there was Rinat Akhmetov's hugely subsidized mining industry and the bulk of its most feverently pro-Russian population. They are better off without both. The Russians could never reach valuable regions like Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk and that is all that matters, at least in Washington and the European capitals. So they have no desire to destabilize a situation that is already going in an acceptable direction. 

&gt;So what are the reasons it would be harder for Putin to support a puppet?

He has no ideology. He really can't justify the sacrifice of men. When his people figure out that the imperial glory of Russia will bring them nothing, he won't be able to draft men to fight without significant unrest. 

He has little industry. The Soviet Union at least tried to industrialize. He on the other hand was not bothered by deindustrialization. Thus he is far more dependent on trade than the soviets ever were. He can't afford to piss off too many of his customers or suppliers, or he risks getting terrible deals from his remaining trade partners.

And finally and most importantly, the domestic piece in Russia is maintained trough a rather delicate balance of separate factions and forces. If the central government is weakened by spending too much resources on an occupation that balance shall be disturbed. To illustrate my point, a few months ago, when Russia was most active in Ukraine, relations with the Western world were at their lowest and the economic indicators didn't look good, the president of Chechnya realized he could behave with utter impunity and Putin won't do anything about it.

Il faut beaucoup plus de force et de tempérament qu'on ne le croit pour se passer de la foi en une religion. Les premiers signes après la laïcisation de notre société, furent le développement des sectes et communautés spirituelles en tous genres, que nous avons considérés à tort comme des épiphénomènes assez extra-ordinaires, limités à quelques post-soixante-huitards mal reconvertis et leur progéniture. A mesure que nous nous sommes affranchis de la religion, comme émancipés, nous avons négligé en effet le vide immense, impossible à supporter pour le commun des mortels (et aussi les rois dirait Pascal), auquel nous avons confronté les esprits. 

Je crois que même sans injustices et sans inégalités c'est fatal, chacun a besoin de son opium, il peut s'agir d'un parti politique, religieux, d'une cause humanitaire, d'un objectif intellectuel et cognitif, mais on ne vit pas sans ce sentiment de quelque chose qui nous dépasse et nous rend infiniment petits.

Babbel is very well done, but most of the content is not free. I am using the free parts and find them useful.

There are a lot of other apps which train specific skills, like the gender of nouns, or German verbs, or vocabulary. 

You can find lots of interesting stuff on Youtube, like the Easy German videos. here's one: http://youtu.be/gzx7QzxDbwk

Try also to visit the Goethe Institut website, you can use it to test your German and to get some free studying material. https://www.goethe.de/en/spr/ueb.html

But the best way to learn, once you understand the language enough, is to find content you really enjoy and want to learn about in German. You'll be really engaged, eager to understand it and you'll learn faster. 

You can also use Reddit. There are subreddits on German movies, dokus, music, sport, German puns...

If you need a teacher, my advice would be to avoid group courses.  They are expensive, you don't learn at your own pace, you have to interact with your peers who also still have to learn the language. If the other people are slow or unmotivated it gets really annoying. Find someone who is a native and has experience in teaching, you'll learn much faster. 

I hope it helps! Good luck :)",null,0,null,1437914964,null,0,false,0,ctgmb2g,null,t3_3enhwz,null,t1_ctgmb2g,null,t3_3enhwz,null,null,null,1440093430,null,3,false,German,t5_2qq51,3,null

On top of that, control theory is also really REALLY hard.

Putting the two together means that the kind of software you'd have to write to get this done is:

a) So computationally involving it's unrealistic to deploy on an aircraft.

but more importantly:

b) So complicated it would be almost impossible to certify. 

Most software on aircraft is really really dumb, and written in languages most people developing for consumer hardware haven't heard of in decades. This is because the behaviour needs to be absolutely known and absolutely repeatable. Yet despite the ridiculous amount of regulations we still have shit like the 787 overflow bug and software behaviour not well known to pilots like what happened in Hamburg (found in this thread) and what downed the Air France A330 over the south atlantic.

En clair, on a énormément d'animaux dans notre population. Demandez aux indiens de l'élite ou aux chinois de l'élite, ils tiendront les même propos que moi. 

Dans un monde de plus en plus globalisé, vous avez le devoir d'aider le reste du monde a atteindre votre niveau d'éducation et de civisme, ou sinon, pour des raisons démographiques, les problèmes du tiers monde finiront chez vous

Source? Mi sbaglierò, ma non mi sembra che il link che mi hai passato dica questo. L'unica parte in cui parla di pagamenti è all'inizio della sezione ""il contesto"", dove dice solo che 

&gt; Sebbene la scena teatrale e lo spazio dell’arte in genere siano sempre spazi pubblici, e l’accesso sia permesso a chiunque, talvolta dietro il pagamento di un biglietto talvolta gratuitamente, presentare un lavoro all’aperto significa portarlo anche allo sguardo di cittadini e passanti casuali, significa permettere o cercare l’imbattersi fortuito dello sguardo sull’opera, sul gesto.

Il che non solo non afferma che lo spettacolo fosse a pagamento, ma riconosce che il fatto che passanti non interessati potessero imbattersi nell'opera era noto e voluto.

Si noti anche più avanti, dove dice che 

&gt; Vi era infine un contesto culturale specifico, quello di un festival che ha costruito le sue linee artistiche, e le ha presentate e discusse sia nei suoi testi e materiali editoriali ampiamente diffusi, sia a Santarcangelo in Consiglio Comunale e in una presentazione pubblica del programma alla città: **linee di ricerca sul rapporto tra arte e scandalo e più precisamente su che cosa l’arte può fare e che cosa le è permesso di fare, nei luoghi deputati e nello spazio pubblico.**

Il fatto che ora facciano i sorpresi e si lamentino che non tutti abbiano apprezzato lo spettacolo è, francamente, patetico. Hanno *cercato* lo scandalo e la controversia, e ora giocano a fare le menti elevate deluse dal fatto che il volgo non apprezzi l'essere esposto a chiappe e piscio. 

Si noti infine - e secondo me è la parte più penosa di tutte - l'argomento di ""ma abbiamo anche recitato il discorso di Breivik, com'è che non vi offendete di questo invece?"" 

Come se non fosse chiaro che un discorso, anche uno di pessimo gusto, può essere ignorato dai passanti casuali senza nessuna fatica, mentre invece per forza di cose un corpo nudo e un getto di piscio catturano - volenti o nolenti - molto di più l'attenzione...",null,0,null,1437915540,null,0,false,0,ctgmhaf,null,t3_3el0yd,null,t1_ctgmhaf,null,t1_ctgikai,null,null,null,1440093512,null,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1,null

*In British English it refers to a state of mind where a person is obstinately, irrationally, or unfairly intolerant of ideas, opinions, or beliefs that differ from their own, and intolerant of the people who hold them.*

*In American English, the term can be used similarly;* ***however, it can also be used to refer to intolerance towards a group of people in general based on their group characteristics such as race, religion, national origin, gender, disability, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status.***",null,0,null,1437917033,null,0,false,0,ctgmyoc,null,t3_3ekbvn,null,t1_ctgmyoc,null,t1_ctgjvpg,null,null,null,1440093739,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

null,false,HighDagger,EURO,European Union,null,"&gt; I have to wonder why you go out of your way to defend xenophobic statements all over this thread

I'm not. If that's the case, then you're misreading it, at least from how I understand the term xenophobia. Even in this comment you just replied to, I explicitly stated

&gt; Criticism of institutionalized superstition and harsh scrutiny of **any ideology** should be encouraged, not discouraged.

That's by definition not xenophobic, but a general statement.

I'm against institutionalized superstition of any kind, particularly - but not exclusively - religious. And because the debate has become so polarized that you yourself feel compelled to put people into two camps and paint the issue as black vs white, because people have started to defend Islam (ideology) instead of defending Muslims (people), I feel that I have to go out of my way to speak out against that.  
I don't believe that religion needs more defenders. People do. Religion needs more criticism.

&gt; Surely there would also be lots of comments from the other side of the spectrum to pick apart on.

There are, but racism is already pretty undeniably ridiculous and universally frowned upon, and rightfully so. So I don't feel a need to add on top of that *most of the time*, though I do sometimes call that out too. I did that [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3egye5/two_guys_pretend_to_be_gay_in_kiev_ukraine_ends/ctf7y2d?context=3), for example. Also [earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3elk20/swedish_nationalists_plan_gay_pride_march_through/ctgjdak), as I just remembered.

In that regard I more or less follow the sentiment of Mark Twain, when he said  

&gt; Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to stop and reflect.

There's a growing number of people (**on both sides**) who conflate rejection of Islam with discrimination against Muslims, and a growing number of people who come too close to defending religion in that context.",null,0,null,1437917097,null,0,1437918535,0,ctgmzg5,null,t3_3elk20,null,t1_ctgmzg5,null,t1_ctgmaaq,null,null,null,1440093750,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Prepaid SIM cards can be bought pretty much everywhere, which includes the many kiosks (""Spätis"") in the city, though you typically have to wait up to 24 hours for the card to be unlocked after activating it.

Current popular and cheap carriers include (links are in German):

- [Congstar](http://www.congstar.de/prepaid/smart-mix/) (highly customizable plans, starting at 4€ for 100 MB and 100 minutes)

- [simyo](https://www.simyo.de/tarife.html) (several options, 7.90€ for 200 MB and 200 min/SMS)

- [FONIC](https://www.fonic.de/fonic-tarife-handy-smartphone-mobiles-internet) (starting at 9.95€ for 200 MB and 400 min/SMS)

- [ALDI Talk](https://www.alditalk.de/nord/Telefonieren_Surfen/aldi_talk_paket_300.php) (7.99€ for 300MB and 300 min/SMS, only buyable in ALDI discounters iirc though)

- [O2](https://www.o2-freikarte.de/prepaid-tarife/smart-m) (9.99€ for 250MB and 200 min/SMS, free calls to other O2 customers [O2 is very popular among younger people here, so this might be worth it])

- [T-Mobile](https://www.t-mobile.de/tarife/0,10821,17773-_3288,00.html) (9.95€ for 250MB, full SMS flatrate and Telekom landline flat, but 0.09€ for other calls)

All prepaid, just remember to mention this when buying the SIM.

SIM cards are typically free, or rather: They cost a small amount of money which is then turned into a starting balance which you can use to unlock the individual plans.

Emergency calls (112) to police, fire department and ambulance are always free btw, just so you know that you won't have to get free minutes just for those kinds of calls.

Let me know if you have any more questions, I can also go and ask the kiosk around the corner about the package prices if you want.

P.S.: I'd personally take Congstar or simyo if I were you.

**Edit:** Forgot about the roaming part. You might prefer simyo (0.12€/min to landlines, 0.29€/min to Canadian mobiles) or [BLAU.de](http://www.blau.de/tarif/smart-option) (9.90€ for 200 min, 200 SMS and 200MB, 0.09€ to landlines and 0.29€ to mobiles + 0.15€ connection fee) then.

&gt; Party memberships can be revoked when an individual commits a transgression against the core values of the party. 

That assumes that the same people will find a similar or greater degree of representation on the issues that matter to them in other political parties. But the political landscape even in multi party systems isn't diverse enough for that, and most of all not beyond demagogy and populism (and this too goes for all sides).

Can you see that? (A bit of a direct question, but I feel it's at the core of the issue.)

edit: I read that as 'people should revoke their own membership when they feel a party official or other representatives of the party commit transgressions against some of their own beliefs'.

However, I don't see how the comment you linked to contradicts anything of what I said. 

So, what if it's just a ""very vocal section of India's population"" (Bernard_Woolley in your link). The fact remains, that this is a [significant and growing share of the population](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8660064.stm) [BBC News from 5 years ago] who like or even idolize Hitler for his ""leadership qualities and discipline"" (see the article) and see him ""as someone who can solve problems"" (ibid.).

I was actually only trying to point out that it's important in this case to consider the fact that, being Indian, the flatmate would probably think it a good idea to give someone a copy of ""Mein Kampf"" as a present. 
You seemed baffled about that, which is understandable from a 'Western' perspective and/or if you don't know about the different attitude that many - especially young - Indians have towards Hitler. (The how and why is explained very well in the comment you linked to.)

&gt; On en sait plus sur les propos échangés lors de l’agression qui s’est déroulée mercredi au parc Léo-Lagrange. L’une des cinq filles mises en cause dans l’agression d’une femme de 21 ans qui bronzait en maillot de bain a interpellé cette dernière par cette phrase : « Allez vous rhabiller, c’est pas l’été ! ».
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Dans un communiqué envoyé ce dimanche, le maire Arnaud Robinet réaffirme son soutien à la victime. « Nous nous sommes engagés à préserver la tranquillité de nos concitoyens et la sécurité publique dans tous les quartiers. Pour ce faire, nous mettons en œuvre les dispositifs nécessaires : augmentation progressive des effectifs de la police municipale et déploiement de la vidéosurveillance.

Par contre, il est également intolérable de stigmatiser une communauté ou une autre pour un acte commis par quelques-uns et sans connaître le fond de cette affaire.

It used to be possible, so I'm not sure why it shouldn't be now. As to being a good thing, I think if you can't have a passionate debate about the future of your country and how you are governed then it gives too much power to the politicians to do what they want.

&gt;However, it is very conductive to Realpolitik, something that has been successful in Germany since the War; we're obviously flourishing, maybe with a lack of new ideas but sustainable. 

Germany has had it's up and downs though, like pretty much everyone else.

""Cultural enrichment"" is only a part of it...the real problem is that many European economies are a pyramid scheme that relies on an ever-growing population and ever-shrinking social solidarity/welfare programs in order to remain solvent. Even immigrants who don't work are beneficial as they increase strain on the welfare state, making it more profitable for megacorps, and (allegedly) harvest immigrant children as cheap labo(u)r and [(really allegedly) kidnap them, Gypsy-style, to increase the white majority's genetic diversity.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3038084/Norway-taking-foreign-children-away-parents-highest-rates-inbreeding-world-Country-forced-deny-claims-Lithuanian-child-taken-care.html)

Copypasta-ing something I wrote in /r/futurewhatif:

&gt;There are two possible routes that a shrinking country could take, both of which are flawed.

&gt;1) Accept immigration to fill the gap. This will likely cause cultural friction and, in a welfare state, could lead to many of the immigrants complacently living off welfare. A non-welfare state could be worse as native populations face direct competition for decent jobs with a minimal safety net and impoverished immigrants turn to crime to make ends meet.

&gt;2) Do not accept immigration and attempt to decline with dignity. This is almost as flawed, if not more so, for two reasons. One, a declining population is skewed towards the elderly (medically fragile and often retired), which in the long run burdens the younger generations. Two, in order to keep nominal GDP increasing and to keep banks solvent, the missing people need to be made up for either by higher inflation (bad for consumers) and-or sharp increases in per capita productivity (which are difficult to sustain in an aging society). Short of periodically culling elders, these problems can be quite bad in the long run, leading for instance to a lost generation of overworked, underemployed Japanese.

Swedish media has laws and customs not to reveal the ethnicity of alleged and convicted criminals. But I don't really think it is that important what their ethnicity exactly is. These are criminal gangs that need to be broken down and erased. I suppose you can find some hints [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime_in_Sweden).

Playing this as some sort of evil of immigrants. If you bring in immigrants from less developed areas, your crime rates are going to go up. It's a universal phenomenon and there is no disputing it. Assembling large ""ghettos"" of immigrants is just going to amplify this effect. But claiming that people of certain ethnicity are inherently morally corrupt or inferior in some ways is a rather large step I wouldn't take that casually.

The open borders of Europe also allow for organised crime to more easily spread their tentacles. They can easily use the immigrants as footholds to gain access to your country.

I wonder if I'm far right or far left with reasoning like this. Many years ago I actually lived for a month in Malmö. What is happening now is rather insane.

You claim them to attack indiscriminately civilians, it seems the targets more often than not are Police Officers, Gendarmerie, Army and otherwise people representative of the Turkish State, or Kurds collaborating with the Turkish State.

Even though you posted a bunch of links to Turkish State Tv from a Channel called ""Facts about the PKK"" (bias much?) I took the time to try and verify a lot of the claims made. Sure enough for a lot of those the only source was either that channel, or other outlets that lead back to that channel. This does not mean your claims are not true, but it does put them in a different light. 

From what I gather, largely, the PKK and the other Kurdish dissident groups, seem to be struggling for their ***right to self determination*** which as you must know, is a human right.
That is not an excuse for terrorist actions, like suicide attacks, however is not an excuse either for state terrorism.

This may be hard for you to swallow, but the PKK (and the Kurdish cause at large) has received lots of positive western media coverage like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zxlFQxkQ4 

I would also add that they have been at the forefront of fighting an actual issue, ISIS, an ""enemy of the West"" that Turkey has been accused repeatedly of allowing through its borders http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/06/12/415486/Turkey-Syria-ISIL-National-Intelligence-Organization-MT-Cumhuriyet-Selahattin",null,0,null,1437920867,null,0,false,0,ctgoet0,null,t3_3el8z2,null,t1_ctgoet0,null,t1_ctghsj7,null,null,null,1440094422,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

Boy did that attitude change, even Eisenhower claim that the British had suffered so much in 3 years that we was unwilling to take risks, yet here you are 75 years later with hindsight and you make light of the situation to try and make a point?  

America wasn't on the front lines of 2 World Wars, they was an ocean away, sure there was a couple of U-Boats but that was it, also the USSR couldn't have won the war on their own, the USN and Royal Navy where taking supplies to the USSR so they could fight (They wouldn't have won without those supplies).

Britain was buy WW1 ships, weapons and other supplies from the USA BEFORE lend lease, we ended up sinking the French Navy in desperation to show you that we was willing to do what ever it takes to win. 

You thought we wouldn't survive 2 weeks in the Battle of Britain. The allies won because Britain wasn't conquered, and so it could still ship supplies around the world (Having complete control of the sea's) and was the staging point of the largest naval invasion in history.

If Britain lost, America would have been invaded eventually and so the USSR would have fell. 

Problem is you just saw the war as your way to benefit, you didn't care what happened and as soon as you saw your chance to bargin you decided to get as much as you could from your ""ally"".

&gt;Einstellungen nach dem Opportunitätsprinzip
&gt;
Oftmals ist zwar die Schuld des Beschuldigten erwiesen, eine Ahndung mit einer Geldstrafe aber unverhältnismäßig und unangemessen. Für die Fälle hat der Staatsanwalt mehrere in seinem Ermessen stehende Einstellungsmöglichkeiten (Opportunitätsprinzip)
&gt;
Eine Einstellung des Verfahrens nach § 153a I StPO ist möglich, wenn der Beschuldigte Auflagen oder Weisungen erfüllt, die ihm vom Staatsanwalt erteilt wurden.
&gt;
Eine solche Einstellung ist nur möglich bei minderschweren Straftaten und geringer Schuld des Täters. Als zulässige Auflagen oder Weisungen nennt das Gesetz die Zahlung einer Geldbuße an die Staatskasse oder eine gemeinnützige Einrichtung, das Erbringen von Wiedergutmachungsleistungen an den Verletzten, die regelmäßige Erfüllung von Unterhaltspflichten oder das Erbringen sonstiger gemeinnütziger Leistungen, die Teilnahme an einem Verkehrsseminar. Eine solche Entscheidung hat viele Vorteile. Dem Täter wird das öffentliche Strafverfahren und eine Vorstrafe erspart, der Staat spart die aufwändige Hauptverhandlung und zugleich kann dem Opfer der Straftat eine Wiedergutmachung zugeführt werden.
&gt;
In Fällen, in denen dem Beschuldigten ein Vergehen mit besonders geringer Schuld zur Last gelegt wird, ist eine Einstellung nach § 153 StPO auch ohne Auflagen oder Weisungen möglich. Diese folgenlose Einstellung belastet den Beschuldigten kaum.
&gt;
Ist der Beschuldigte wegen einer anderen Tat bereits verurteilt worden und fällt daneben die für die neue Tat zu erwartende Strafe nicht beträchtlich ins Gewicht , so kann der Staatsanwalt das Verfahren ebenfalls einstellen (§ 154 I StPO).
&gt;
In Strafverfahren aus dem engen persönlichen Umwelt des Opfers, beispielsweise Hausfriedensbruch, Beleidigung, ""einfacher"" Körperverletzung u.a., in denen ein öffentliches Interesse an der Strafverfolgung nicht vorliegt , stellt die Staatsanwaltschaft das Verfahren gemäß § 376 StPO ein und verweist den Verletzten auf die Privatklage. (19) Dieser muss selbst entscheiden, ob er durch eine Rechtsanwalt ohne Mithilfe der Staatsanwaltschaft das Strafverfahren betreiben will.

Different people practising different cultural traits while living amongst others is multiculturalism, even if they share some traits like a primary language.

2) But those products are fused from many societies. A lot of anti-immigration/multicultural folk claim that only native culture should be practised. But what is or is not part of local culture? a lot of Europeans worship a middle-eastern religion and use a language that was not from their land. Should I not use Indian numbers, Greek mythology, French books and chess because I'm not from those societies? should we abandon words like algebra and chemical because they are Arabic in origin?

3) La Pubilla - Tons of locals and few tourists this place was pretty delicious. The sauces on the squid+ potatoes, seafood ravioli, and rice and seafood were awesome. Be sure to get the toast with the sea urchin butter with sardines. Probably the most unique and delicious thing I've ever tasted.

null,false,Turminder_Xuss,,The Culture,null,"&gt; Du hast auf das Interview verwiesen und jetzt magst du nicht was dort tatsächlich gesagt wird. Stattdessen kommst du mit Floskeln.

Ich habe auf diese ""Doku"" verwiesen weil dort eingeräumt wird, in welchem Ausmaß Russland dort militärisch tätig war und die Ereignisse angetrieben hat. Das Putin das natürlich alles für gerechtfertigt hält ist mir scheissegal, der hat in dieser Krise schon so viel gelogen, dem glaube ich kein Wort.

&gt; Was sind den nochmal die anderen Prämissen, die du erwähnt hast?

Die Prämissen von denen Merkel ausgeht enthalten unter Anderem, dass Russland nicht Hauptakteur ist, dass es nicht zu Gewalt gekommen ist (russische Soldaten haben einen ukrainischen erschossen) und der Vergleich mit dem Kosovo hinkt gewaltig (habe ich anderweitig auch schon dargelegt warum). er nimmt russische Aussagen für bare Münze (Du ja auch). Die These dass die Präsenz der Soldaten sich nur an die Ukrainer richtet und keinen Einfluss auf das Wahlverhalten hat ist auch reichlich gewagt.

&gt; Das klingt zwar alles sehr dramatisch, entspricht nur nicht der Realität.

Ist alles nachgewiesen. Mag Dir vielleicht nicht passen, aber es gibt keinen Zweifel daran. Hier ein [Link.](http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/03/13/ukraine-crisis-russia-aksyonov-idINL6N0M93AH20140313)

&gt; Wie du anerkennen musst wurde das Ergebnis des Referendums durch Gallup und GfK bestätigt, oder sind diese Firmen ebenfalls mit bewaffneten Truppen eingerückt und haben das Volk mit vorgehaltener Waffe befragt?

Ich muss gar nichts. Diese Umfragen sind mir bekannt, die Aussagekraft halte ich allerdings für begrenzt. Pro-Ukrainer haben die Halbinsel verlassen, russische Propaganda läuft Tag und Nacht und man kann nicht sicher sein dass die Leute am Telefon wirklich die Wahrheit sagen. Dein Strohmann zieht nicht.

&gt; Du meinst die Nazi Vergleiche? Die sehr wohl begründet waren, da zu der Zeit in der Übergangsregierung viele Posten an die Rechtsextremen vergeben wurden.

Und die meisten davon haben ihre Posten inzwischen nicht mehr. Aber man wollte ja nicht abwarten, oder verhandeln (was Avakov direkt gefordert hat) sondern man hat gleich Fakten geschaffen. Dass es in der Ukraine (wie auch in Russland) Probleme mit Rechtsextremismus gibt ist bekannt, aber das Problem löst man sicher nicht durch Gewalt und Propaganda.

&gt; Ah, jetzt greifen wir auf Spekulationen zurück. Waren die Gallup und GfK Umfragen auch möglicherweise gefälscht?

Aussage von Menschenrechtsbeauftragten der russischen Regierung und Representanten der Krimtataren. 

&gt; Ein freies Referendum wurde ermöglicht, und wurde auch abgehalten. Deine plumpe Behauptung, dass das Volk seinen Willen nicht kund tun konnte, entbehrt jeglicher Basis und widerspricht dem was geschehen ist.

Kannst Du noch so oft behaupten, es wird davon nicht wahrer. Es ist eine Schutzbehauptung dass es ohne russische Militärgewalt überhaupt keine Debatte um einen Wechsel der Krim nach Russland gegeben hätte. Gewalt sollte die allerletzte Option sein, nicht gleich die erste. Das ""Referendum"" entspricht nicht demokratischen Standards, wie ich dargelegt habe (komisch dass Du das einfach ignorierst), und das sehen alle wichtigen internationalen Organisationen genauso (Europarat, OSZE, UN-Vollversammlung). 

&gt; Die USA haben ihre Kandidaten durchgedrückt und steuern sie nach Belieben, egal wie -- aus deiner Sicht -- ""frei"" sie gewählt wurden.

Und hier interessiert Dich plötzlich überhaupt nicht was das Volk will, und selbst eine freie Wahl hindert Dich nicht daran eine gewählte Regierung als Marionette abzutun. Das mit dem ""frei"" ist übrigens nicht nur meine Meinung. [Hier](http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/231241.html) z.B. eine Einschätzung der OSZE.

- In principle I don't see a problem with allowing the local community to take over the running of a football club. I'm sure the fans don't like it when some foreigner comes in &amp; uses it as their personal money laundering scheme. 
- Prison cost reductions are over 5 years as you said, currently prison costs are around £3 billion, a £0.5 billion cost reduction in 2015 would be a 17% cost reduction. Doesn't seem crazy to me.
- Currently inheritance tax makes no sense, you can avoid it entirely with a small amount of estate planning. That's why they feel the need to bring in changes. Understand that they want to change our society to one that is based upon individual merit as much as possible &amp; not who your parents are. It's not totally unusual either as for example in Denmark gifts are taxed for instance, either as income or some kind of inheritance. In the UK they are taxed as neither. 
- Your position on carbon footprint may differ. The issue is with the way we're going there will be massive sea level rise, large swaths of the world will have no arable land any more &amp; most of Africa will turn into a dust bowl.

When we approach a cross wind landing, we've a choice, [crab, decrab or slip.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosswind_landing)  Slip is more fun, but then the self loading freight complains, so de-crab is normally favoured due to the ability to keep more aileron into the wind.

So so long as you've got enough force on the wing, to prevent the windward one from rising up, then everything is safe.  Worst case is the plane requiring some work afterwards.

Non ho mai sentito NESSUNO dire che il machismo non esiste tra i ""pro-men"", ma non dubito che anche loro abbiano i loro stupidi, dall'altra parte però c'è adirittura una letteratura accademica sulla  ""cultura dello stupro"" e il ""patriarcato"", oltre a un preoccupante neo-fascismo da social network.

There have been very little ethnic tensions between Russian and Ukraine speakers and also with other smaller ethnic minorities. 

They have also tried to act mature and leased land and bases to Russia on Crimea after the independence to avoid confrontation with their large neighbor.

I am disappointed in how EU and NATO has behaved. Have we not learned anything from the WW2 and cold War? You should NEVER allow invasion of peaceful neighbors. When the Russian invaded Crimea there should have been an ultimatum to Russia to leave within 24h or else see military intervention and it would have worked. Russia is much weaker than the number says.  

Now as a EU citizen I will be ashamed of how our governments have acted. We repeat the mistakes that the Democracies in Europe did regarding Hitler and Stalin.

Nombres sont ceux qui se sont investi pleinement dans l'aspect rationnel de leur personne et leur environnement, mais justement la démarche scientifique qui a amené cette vision a se développer est fait de tâtonnement, de réfutations et de  paradigmes qui évoluent. c'est une culture du doute, qui aux mains et esprit des personnes qui se sont coupés de leur spiritualité devient un ensemble de certitude monolithique concernant leur approche de l'existence.   
j'espère être arrivé à exprimer plus clairement ce que j'entendais par là mais bon.   le sujet est vaste, les angles d'approche innombrables.

c'est comme si ne pas croire en dieu, c'est abandonner tout un pan de ce qu'il y a d'humain en dieu. oui, un croyant verra qu'il est l'oeuvre de dieu, son enfant, un non-croyant verra d'où dieu est né, de l'homme qui a enfanté dieu, à son image. 
Ou encore que le fait de ne pas être croyant nous interdit tout ce qui n'appartient pas à la raison.  
exemple agnostique/athée. la différence ? 
Je grossis le trait, un agnostique est conscient qu'il a décidé de ne pas croire, ne sachant réellement la validité de son choix en terme objectif, en tant que sujet, il tranche équipé de ses perceptions limitées.  
En l'absence de certitude sur le sujet, un athée possède la certitude que dieu n'existe pas.
Pourtant, dieu est irréfutable, on ne peut prouver qu'il existe, tout comme qu'il n'existe pas. dieu n'est pas perméable au raisonnement scientifique. 
l'athée s'y appuie pour justifier sa non croyance pourtant.  

l'athée est un agnostique qui s'ignore ? ils ont déja coupé les points avec cette vision de l'existence, on ne sait pas. ce que j'observe c'est qu'un agnostique sera à même de séparer la dimension rationnelle et celle passionnelle de son être, un athée voudrait s'adonner corps et esprit au dieu de la logique.  

on peut voir aussi :  
on est dans des sociétés développées, on a le luxe d'avoir des loisirs, le temps de réfléchir, et pourtant certains restent devant la télé pour combattre l'ennui, occuper leur temps de cerveau disponible à cultiver quoi ? bon y'a des chaines sympa, j'entends, ça reste trivial, même quand j'essaie de prendre la télé en support d'une amorce de réflexion, c'est chaud.  

en gros, c'est ""on se pose des questions quand on a pas le choix"",la réflexion s'amorce sous la contrainte de notre environnement, c'est déjà être dans la réaction, la société confronte la personne qui ne le souhaitait pas.On ne s'occupe du jardin que quand il est parasité, plutôt qu'au quotidien, pour faire une image.  

les considérations de nos sociétés sont fortement imprégnées de matérialisme, certains y adhèrent en bloc, et laissent ensuite le soin à la société de positionner le bien et le mal, de décider pour l'individu les valeurs spirituelles normales. le prèt à penser. certes, c'est des valeurs tout ça tout ça, mais en l'absence de réflexion, peut on savoir que ces valeurs nous correspondent.  
d'autres ont rapport à leur spiritualité, ils pourront penser pour la société et contre la société, pourront se remettre en cause, mettre leur coeur et esprit au diapason.
les autres verront ceci comme de la faiblesse voire de l'incapacité de se décider,en réalité ils s'interrogent sur ce qu'ils pensent réellement et la position qu'ils désirent prendre.  
c'est en ça, ces jeunes se convertissant, ce siècle devenant religieux, c'est des gens qui se raccordent à leur spiritualité de laquelle ils s'étaient coupé ou l'avaient jusque là négligé. il y a bien d'autres façons, moins radicales, d'arriver au même résultat.  
Enfin, dernier essai pour expliquer qu'es ce que l'absence de rapport à sa spiritualité : le ying et le yang, c'est l'équilibre entre les principes contraires et complémentaires (je vais pas développer plus avant la symbolique du signe), les dissocier c'est risquer d'entrer dans un malaise, une tension, une sensation de vide en soi, un déséquilibre.  L'existence, sa dimension physique, sa dimension spirituelle son indissociables.

En tous cas, c'est vrai que l'antisémitisme (comme l'islamophobie, l'homophobie et les amphibies) existe et que des gens se prennent un peu trop la tête sur les lobbys et autres complots à caractère dieudo-soralien, comme on le faisait, donc dans les fameuses années 30 (mais pas seulement).

Mais on n'accuse pas les musulmans de diriger le monde aux dépens des petits, on développe une peur plus médiévale, basique, pas construite sur les rouages supposés du fonctionnement des états, banques et cercles d'oligarques. On joue plus sur l'image catastrophique de la religion que donne l'Etat Islamique et qui est à l'évidence prise comme telle bien souvent (il suffit de parcourir Reddit): malgré l'aspect autrement plus structuré qu'on veut bien le dire dans cet ensemble qui utilise la terreur comme d'une arme ""conventionelle"", on les voit comme les barbares, de l'autre côté d'une frontière géographique qu'ils franchissent seulement pour commettre ces attentats, alors que ""les juifs"", dans l'imaginaire anti-sémite, sont perçus comme des sortes d'agents éparpillés qui font partie de n'importe quelle société. C'est un peu ""diaspora juive VS pieuvre du califat"". Au final, évidemment, il s'agit surtout de clichés qui volent la vedette à une réalité beaucoup plus complexe.

D'un autre côté, depuis que je suis né, je suis entouré de musulmans, et j'ai vu les pratiques et les coutumes évoluer au fil des années. Si quelqu'un ne peut pas être taxé d'islamophobie, c'est bien moi. Ça ne m'empêche pas de comprendre la peur, alimentée par les média, certes, mais qui découle aussi d'une radicalisation évidente d'une frange des musulmans plus large ou plus visible qu'il y a vingt ou trente ans.

Citation from HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH

&gt;""Human Rights Watch's letter to D'Alema recounted that between 1992 and 1995, the height of the conflict, Ocalan's PKK is believed to have been responsible for at least 768 extrajudicial executions, mostly of civil servants and teachers, political opponents, off-duty police officers and soldiers, and those deemed by the PKK to be ""state supporters."" In addition, the PKK committed numerous large-scale massacres of civilians, usually against villagers or villages that were believed to be connected with the state civil defense ""village guard system."" In twenty-five such massacres committed between 1992 and 1995, 360 people were killed, including thirty-nine women and seventy-six children. These actions were not committed by rogue units or commanders, but were PKK official policy. ""

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing
A July 2008 Turkish study by a team from Dicle University on honor killings in the Southeastern Anatolia Region, the predominantly Kurdish area of Turkey, has so far shown that little if any social stigma is attached to honor killing. It also comments that the practice is not related to a feudal societal structure, ""there are also perpetrators who are well-educated university graduates. Of all those surveyed, 60 percent are either high school or university graduates or at the very least, literate.""

Orbán is a narcissistic, but pragmatist politician with control issues who tends to make grandiose gestures and lie but altogether handles the economy fine. The problem is that he is socially conservative and lets corruption exist (though less than any previous government in Hungary did) as well as his control issues which lead to an authoritarian bent though I can truthfully say that the country is still a democracy and it hasn't slid any more backwards than it did in the first few years when Orbán had supermajority in the parliament - he lost it by now.

He is not a good man and I really wish he were gone but I don't see any politician here who would make a good PM except maybe for Schiffer, the leader of the liberal-green LMP.

Often not possible, there is a reason why the landing area is kept as clean as possible with only the up most important stuff. So mostly not allowed due to safety regulations. 

The best way to combat cross winds is changing runways. For example airports in which the wind pattern is not coming always (99% of the time) will always built runways in multiple directions. One of the reasons why we have such a [runway layout in Schiphol](http://www.schiphol.nl/upload/859b01e4-3e75-4f73-84a7-a7a891988ca8_spotplaatsen.png). Ideally, but expense in case of windy (from random directions) you would want to build runways in all directions. [The endless runway project is an example of such a layout](http://www.endlessrunway-project.eu/) [Or something like this](http://www.airfields-freeman.com/FL/Airfields_FL_FtLauderdale_htm_115b7035.jpg)

Or build airports in favorable spots with constant wind all around the year from one direction. (often it's like one half from south the other from noth for example).

The wind was reaching speeds of 100 kph yesterday, and aircraft tend to land between 200 and 300 kph. If the wind is then angled with respect to the track, it means that the plane has to maneuver itself at an angle with respect to the track in order to hit the track straight-on.

Anyway, regarding the forces on the wing, realize a few things.

1. the lift generated by a wing scales quadratic with the air speed over the wing.

2. the wings are significantly swept backwards. This means that the wind direction can be perpendicular to one wing, while almost parallel to the other wing.

3. the force exerted by the air on the aircraft is in the same scale as the weight of the aircraft. ""It's heavy"" is not really a factor.

Basically, what can happen is that the wind causes massive differences in the lift generated by the two wings. If one wing experiences an airflow of 200kph and the other wing an airflow of 140 kph, that means that the second wing is only generating about half the lift of the first wing. That is a quarter of the total lift of the craft trying to flip the airplane on its side. The pilots have to correct for this using the ailerons.

You might be underestimating the amount of control the pilots have over the craft. The forces that can be generated using the control surfaces of the aircraft are massive. Most airframes are designed in order to cope with G loads between 2.5 and -1.

um ehrlich zu sein habe ich keine Top 3. Es gibt viel zu viele Serien die mir gefallen. Ich liste einfach mal auf was mir besonders gefällt.  
Da wäre zum einen ""Better call Saul"". ""Breaking Bad"" fand ich zwar nicht schlecht, aber mir hat der Charakter Jesse nicht so richtig gefallen.  
Die ""IT-Crowd"" finde ich richtig toll, da da viele Computer-Freak Witze gibt und die auch richtig gut umgesetzt sind. Ist allerdings sehr speziell auf das Thema. Also das kann man dann auch sehr schnell nicht mögen.  
""Immer wieder Jim"" oder auch bekannt als ""According to Jim"" ist eine Serie mit Familen-Witz. Ich finde es nur sehr seltsam, dass es wenige gibt, die die Sendung gefallen hat.  
""Whoopi"" - Auch wieder eine Komödie. Diesmal aber eine um Politische Korrektheit. Ich bin darauf gestoßen, weil ich die Schauspielerin Goldberg so mag. Die Komödie hat mir dann auch richtig gut gefallen. Solche ""schwarzen"" Witze hört man nicht immer. Leider wurde sie abgesetzt, weil es anscheinend zu dreckig war\^\^  
""Shin Chan"" und ""Oggy und die Kakerlaken"" fand ich als Kind richtig toll. Immer viel Spaß gehabt das zu schauen.  
Als letztes lass ich hier mal ""Detektiv Conan"" stehen. Das kannte ich auch aus meiner Kindheit und verfolge die Folgen auch noch weiter. Zwar werden die neusten Folgen nicht im TV ausgestrahlt, aber es gibt genug Fans, die es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht haben die Folgen zu übersetzen. Leider bin ich nicht so gut, was Sprache lernen betrifft. Bei Japanisch kann ich dann also gleich einpacken ;D

Déjà premièrement, tout ce qu'il demande n'est pas valable. Je te conseille donc de faire un courrier AR en leur demandant les détails des factures.
De plus, dis leur bien que le loyer ne peux en aucun cas être augmenter de 10%. Il ne peut augmenter qu'à date anniversaire suivant un indice (je ne connais pas le nom de cet indice par contre).
Pour la caution, ils ne peuvent pas la garder. Si tout est ok sur l'EDL, ils ont 1 mois pour te la rendre. Si il y a désaccord, ils ont 2 mois. Car même si tu leur doit 500€, ils ne peuvent garder que 20% de la caution, quitte à ce que tu leur rende l'argent par la suite (lois de mars 2014 si ma mémoire est bonne).
Dans ta lettre soit claire et précise et menace les de les conduire devant la justice. Car leur dossier est bidon et si jamais ça va devant le juge, tu gagneras à tous les coups.

À mon avis, ils doivent faire ça a tout les étudiants. Ceux qui peuvent payer et ne peuvent/veulent pas se défendre font de bonnes poires.

&gt;runway is large enough and empty so that it could hit it perfectly with just GPS

Actually no, GPS is still not certified to be used as a sole means of navigation for aircraft, much less for performing something as precise as a landing. GPS doesn't really work that well once you start changing *altitude*. They are working on improving this, deploying systems like DGPS, but so far these things are still in nascent stages and mostly used by the military. What they *do* have is instrument landing system, or [ILS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_landing_system).

&gt; there have been tests with small UAVs where they shed one of the wings mid flight and it barely tips at all here

Adaptive control is indeed gaining acceptance lately, I believe they actually use it in F-35. But there are also issues with that. Imagine, for example, that suddenly the aircraft detects failure and decides to alter it's dynamics. First problem here is that this process is not *transparent*. I.e. it's essentially a black-box solution. When things go wrong you would generally like to know what's happening, with adaptive control it becomes more complicated. If the aircraft does something and the pilot does not know what it is, it becomes difficult for him to make informed decisions. The second issue is what happens if there is a sensor failure. The aircraft might alter it's controls based on the readings that it gets from the sensors, while nothing is wrong. Then again, the pilot would have no idea what's going on and it might lead to a dangerous situation. The third issue is that this approach pushes pilot into a supervisory position, where the humans perform worst. Flying becomes 99% boredom and 1% terror. 

&gt;With autonomous cars sensing their environment is much much harder it's many orders of magnitude harder

With autonomous cars, in worst case scenario you could just slam the brakes. With aircraft you don't have this liberty.",null,0,null,1437927732,null,0,false,0,ctgrmrw,null,t3_3en3i4,null,t1_ctgrmrw,null,t1_ctgl997,null,null,null,1440095940,null,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7,null

&gt; Where is the line you ask? There is no line. The whole concept of 'integration' is only meant to create an artificial divide between the 'integrated' and 'non-integrated'. This becomes clear when using the following example: when talking of autochtonous Dutch, German, or Brits it is unnecessary to even use the term integration when describing them. That they are integrated is self evident, and therefore it doesn't even have to be named. When speaking of the group of non-integrated people, the most these people can achieve is 'integrated', but notice, for these people that they are integrated isn't self-evident at all - that they are integrated has to be pronounced. This means that if you as 'pronounced integrated' makes a foul you can lose your status again of 'integrated', this while the 'self-evident integrates' have there status fixed. It is therefore clear that the divide 'integrated' and 'non-integrated' is *diagrammatical*, which means that it is a divide that only exist at the moment the divide has been pronounced, and not something that is naturally there.",null,0,null,1437928257,null,0,false,0,ctgrwvb,null,t3_3eled9,null,t1_ctgrwvb,null,t1_ctgntvv,null,null,null,1440096072,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

We leave. Sooner or later we emigrate, because it's that or going nuts, so it's just a matter of time we find courage to leave everything behind.

Some people claim we should stay and try to find something even if it means abandon our careers, as job offers are almost non existent even in some fields of engineering, or the few you find require an expertise you'll never get here.

And to be honest, it's really easy to loose hope after a few interviews whether it is because of the salary or selection processes which last many months (last week I was rejected after 7 months of process and 3 interviews for a structural engineer position worse paid than supermarket cashier). Before you notice you will realize you have been 1 year unemployed, with little to no expectations to ever have a life, family or whatsoever.

That's why I decided to move abroad (I was lucky to have worked a year and a half) by the end of the next month. I bet it was very similar for many others here and in Greece.
