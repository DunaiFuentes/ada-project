And the huge debt relief, that would be necessary cant be communicated to the citizens of the involved countries. For most leading parties it would be political suicide to carry out something like that.

L'avantage de l'Euro pour l'Allemagne c'est quand même de lier ses premiers partenaires économiques à la monnaie, afin qu'ils ne puissent pas dévaluer. La seule solution est alors la désinflation compétitive, typiquement ce qu'a fait l'Allemagne depuis Schroeder, mais il faut être le premier à la faire pour tuer des voisins économiques.

About Greece, I would say that it's a matter that hasn't been handled that well. AFAIK Roma aren't homogeneous and different tribes (?) behave, develop differently. Thus, we have a lot of Roma communities completely integrated and - although suffering some discrimination - part of the society.

The problem is the communities that are still camps and generate a lot of crime. Some might say that it's due to poverty, but truth be told, there have been numerous police interventions where people tent-like housing were hiding tons of money ( procured illegally: drugs, human trafficking, child beggary schemes  )

There are parts of Athens suburbs that people try to avoid Roma. It's racist, but having seen with my own eyes what can happen if you're not alert ( on purpose running in the middle of the street to get hit, gang following to ask for money ) I wouldn't be quick to judge. But there is a lot of racism in other aspects, e.g. schooling, where whole communities deny Roma children entry to the schools.

Off the beaten track for international tourist routes, but not too off the beaten track so that there is no infrastructure. Great beaches and water in the Baltic Sea is a few degrees warmer than in the North Sea, making it more pleasant for swimming. Wheather can be hit and miss, but with a bit of luck you get plenty of sunshine. 

One destination that has gotten good international press is Heiligendamm and the other small places around it. Heiligendamm was the site of the G8 meeting in 2007 and there are still restaurants that serve the dishes the big state leaders had at the time. Heiligendamm itself is a bit of a posh place, so budget concious people tend to stay in or around Kühlungsborn and then take the [Molli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molli_railway) to Heiligendamm or Bad Doberan for a day trip. 

Another great destination is Ruegen Island. It is Germany's largest island and a popular tourist destination among Germans. I can especially recommend [Binz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binz).  Again you can get to Binz with a steam train, this one is called [Rasender Roland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BCgensche_B%C3%A4derbahn).

Clearly they did, since they kept cutting far deeper than even their record deficit (15%). So the story of ""the Greeks borrow money to spend it on luxuries"" is nonsense, or the Trojka is so incompetent they cannot distinguish discretionary expenses from expenses that generate economic surplus.

&gt;And no, running an unsustainable debt never makes anyone an economic genius.

The debt was sustainable on its own. It's the added difficulty of bailing out bankrupt banks and being denied assistance by their own central bank that makes it impossible.

&gt;When did the IMF make that claim?

You haven't been paying attention, have you? It's one of the key elements of information in the debate.

[This evidence, and
our finding of no gap, on average, between assumed and actual fiscal multipliers before the
crisis, would imply that multipliers assumed prior to the crisis were around 0.5.[...]If we put this together, and use the range of coefficients reported in our tables, this suggests
that actual multipliers were substantially above 1 early in the crisis. ](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp1301.pdf)

Of course it matters. If you're trying to eliminate a deficit by cutting expenses, you cannot cut expenses that generate more income than they cost: you dig the hole deeper that way.

Leider ist die Zeitung (Fortean Times; Jun2013, Vol. 302, p5-5, 1/2p ) nicht über den Unizugang erhätlich, aber ein Artikel von Garry Nolan in der Fortean Times wird so zusammengefasst: 

&gt;The article discusses the result of the scientific investigation of the skeletal remains of a tiny creature wrapped in cloth that was found in the Atacama Desert in Chile near an abandoned church in 2003. It explains that the so-called Atacama Humanoid measures only about six inches. A study conducted by Garry Nolan of Stanford University indicates that the humanoid is human or closer to human than chimpanzees.

ist dieser Abschnitt interessant:

&gt;
My early statement on camera that this (being) might have been eating, breathing and living is no longer a conclusion I feel strongly about. Dr. Lachman never said that, so it would be incorrect to broadly include him in what I (personally) stated tentatively. I repeat - the tenet and basis of the documentary approach was to hear me ""speculate"" - not conclude. Even at the time of the ""last interview"" in the documentary we only thought the specimen's bones ""appeared"" to suggest an older specimen than the size would lead one to believe.

Der nächste Abschnitt ist auch ganz interessant: 

&gt;The bone results are the only thing right now that suggests it is older. “Suggest” does not equal “prove”. That the bone epiphyses are “apparently” 6-8 years does not “prove” it was 6-8 years. It just makes the question worth answering as to “why” the bones look older. Is it an artifact of the mummification or drying process? Some new form of rapid aging? I don’t know and I suspect we won’t ever truly know without a lot more work.

It's only when travellers behave a certain way do people start to think of them as Roma, but the well-rounded, perfectly affable and respectful Roma traveller, as I'm sure there are, isn't readily recognised as being Roma.

You can be sure that the upper-middle class has largely moved their money into foreign bank accounts by now. A Grexit will not substantially hurt their balances. The people that would lose their savings to devaluation are almost exclusively the middle and lower-middle classes. 

&gt;And with sufficient humanitarian aid and a debt write down for private citizens there would not really be a huge need to sell off property for the Greek people.

I never got the mentality that billions in humanitarian aid = fine, new bailout = the Greeks don't deserve another cent of our money!!!1!. 

&gt;I'm not aware of any solution that would not require heavy concessions from Greek people.

Gypsy is an English term dating to the Middle Ages. People in Britain assumed Romas were from Egypt as they had dark skin, and Egypt was the only southern country people knew of. Gypsy = Egyptian. 

Lastly there is Zigeuner / Zigan / Sigøjner etc. It stems from Greek and means Slave or Working class person or something similar. 

All the terms are used interchangeably. All Gypsies I know use the term ""Gypsy"" when referring to themselves in English. Zigan is often used in Hungarian, and the equivalent forms I wrote are the main ones used in Germanic Europe, both by natives and Romas who refer to themselves. Roma is mainly used in official communications, by white people who don't know any Roma, and by people who speak Romani (which is sadly a dying language at this point).

null,false,Punica_granatum,FINL,Finland,null,"Whoa. You're in for some bad stories here. You're brave to ask, I hope you won't be too upset.

Some Roma people have been present in Finland since the 16th century (most people here don't know this). They have pretty much been living on the margins of the society for centuries, leading a rather nomadic life and sometimes selling stuff or working as craftsmen. [Here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Kale) is some information in English. The Finnish Roma have a distinct dialect and a culture somewhat different from other Roma due to them being isolated here for so long.

Stereotypes are bad. It's better now than it was some decades ago, when you could still see Roma going around with ""caravans"" of sort and people told their kids that gypsies will steal them if they behave badly. There has been a lot discrimination from the state obviously, even in 1960's there were things like forced sterilizations of Roma women (this is not much talked about and has only recently been studied).

The most common stereotype is ""gypsies will steal anything they can, live off social welfare, drop out of school and don't want to work or contribute to society"". However, there is a certain peculiar tone to this, since the Finnish Roma people are still ""our own kind of Roma"" and ethnic Finns are used to them. Since the 1940's or so there have been many beloved singers and television personas (especially singers of Finnish tango) that were Roma and this has helped to change attitudes towards them. So it's rather complex. The Finnish Roma also have a distintive ""traditional"" dress (since about 1960's or 1970's this dress has become heavily decorated with lace etc.) that many of them wear and so they are very easily noticed. A dress like this has recenty been added to the Finnish National Museum's permanent exhibition along with other traditional costumes, which I've understood was a somewhat proud moment to the Finnish Roma. Recently there have also been more ""awareness"" (sorry about the cheesy term) about Roma culture and the divide between Roma and ethnic Finns seems to be getting smaller as both sides are working on it and getting more information.

However, in the recent years there has been an increasing number of Roma from Eastern Europe coming to Finnish cities. This has been very problematic, as they beg on the streets and several cases of theft (such as stealing jewelry off old people while talking to them) have been reported. Now, this is especially unsettling to Finns as begging hasn't been common here since early 1900's and is frowned upon. It makes us very uncomfortable to see old women in rags sitting on a side of street begging in rain and snow with a Christian icon or something beside her. Some people want to give them money but many feel conflicted due to allegations about human trafficking and other forms of organized crime connected to the phenomenon. There has been a lot of public discussion about whether begging should be prohibited by law. Children are not allowed to beg as using them in begging is illegal. To explain this further, it's kind of similar to the fact that there is practically no tipping culture in Finland. We don't like the idea of tipping a waiter since it feels like it places the waiter in an inferior and inequal position; it's the same with begging. Giving money to a beggar feels like saying ""I'm above you"" and we don't want to do that. Most Finns think that poor people should be helped through state welfare without stigmatizing them as ""inferior"", just as a waiter should just have a sufficient wage without having to rely on tips.

The attitudes towards these new Roma are _way_ worse than those towards the old minority. The influx of these people is also making stereotypes about Roma in general a lot worse. Though I'd say that outright hate towards the newcomers is rare, most Finns just feel that aggressive begging is not something we should see here and thus are very uncomfortable. There have been stories about these people and the kind of life they are living in their countries of origin and generally people feel sorry for them. But we tend to think that the societal problems should be solved in those countries, not by people going all over Europe to beg and sending money home.

One more thing: the traditional culture of the Finnish Roma is very conservative, especially with modesty questions and a strong us vs. them mentality towards ethnic Finns. The blood feud/vengeance also is still a thing, which results in large families moving to different parts of the country to avoid a family they have the feud with. These aspects of the culture have been publicly criticized by Roma and ethnic Finns alike; however, the Roma people that choose to talk about this publicly have often received death threats from other Roma.

You and I have a different outlook on government then.

I feel that government is to serve the best interests of their people in conjunction with the wishes of the people.

If what the people want will result in their absolute eventual destruction, the government has an obligation to choose a different path.

&gt;That hypothetical party reversing course does not mean they suddenly saw reason, but that they were only interested in seizing power and were willing to lie blatantly in order to do so.

Agreed.  

My stance isn't that Syriza is trustworthy or that they aren't a massive group of liars.

My stance is that, despite being liars and despite the Greeks willfully looking to burn their economy to the ground, Syriza should reject this path.

&gt;And again, why hold elections at all if we should ignore the people's will when it is convenient? 

Well I was quite vocal that I *don't* think we should hold referendums.

As far as elections, I think one of the main purposes is specifically to protect the people from themselves.  Mob mentality is a real thing.  Sometimes, it takes a leader to step back, reject the emotional reaction, and choose a better path.

Again, these are all basic concepts behind a representative democracy.

What you describe is a direct democracy.  In that situation, the will of the people is *always* respected because the will of the people directly decides all issues.

You can advocate for that if you want, but I'm not sure you will like the results should you get it.

&gt;And why would a proven liar be fit to decide that the people should be ignored?

Hey, I'm not taking the stance that Syriza is fit to lead the people.

My stance is that *whoever* ends up in charge, regardless of if they are fit for the position or not, has an ultimate responsibility to the survival and protection of the country.

If the will of the people will destroy the country, whoever holds the positions of power, even if they are unfit for such a role, have an obligation to turn away from the will of the people and not take the path to certain destruction.",null,0,null,1436702090,null,0,false,0,ct0lcbo,null,t3_3cuj5o,null,t1_ct0lcbo,null,t1_ct0ktxm,null,null,null,1440484437,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Every single time they occupy the space there, suddenly, cars get broken in to, stolen, etc, which simply does not happen in a small town like mine.

But the most enraging thing that happened recently (4-5 months ago, about the last time they ""dropped by"") is that the doctor (whom helps little kids with underdeveloped leg/arm muscles walk and move about) was robbed in the fucking middle of the day.

As she recalled it to me :""
I opened the door and there was a guy who I didn't recognise, he looked sort of rough and I knew he wasn't the father of one of the kids so i didn't let him in right away, I asked him why he was here, and he asked if he could come in with a terrible French accent, so i said ""no because I don't know you"" and when I tried to close the door he put his foot in to block it and suddenly from the left of the door came 6 other guys who just rushed past me and started grabbing anything and everything they could carry, there were so many of them there wasn't possibly anything I could do about it""


And you want to hear the kicker? the thing that makes me want to go gun down those motherfuckers when they come back? the police couldn't do anything about it.
Apparently they have a sort of special citizenship that means as long as they don't return to their country of origin they can't be charged with a crime.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt;  It's pretty much universally known at this point that Red Berets and Arkan's Tigers were paid, supplied and trained by the intelligence service of Serbia. It's also known that Scorpions, the unit that did most of the killings, was an offshoot of Arkan's Tigers. It's also known that those paramilitaries pretty much all fled to Serbia after the war and became an official part of Serbian law enforcement as JSO (with some nice side effects, such as a coup attempt and assassination of PM).

Yep, all true.

&gt; So how can we be sure that the massacre wasn't done with support from Milošević's government, or at least tacit approval?

In short and officially, International Court of Justice determined  that Republic of Serbia wasn't involved in the Srebrenica massacre. However it is guilty for not preventing it to happen.


Edit: When people think about this war they tend to simplfy things and view either side as a unified block ie. all Serbs thought the same and had same goals, all Bosnians thought the same and had same goals etc. The truth is much more complicated. For example Karadzic and Mladic didn't really respect Milosevic. Seselj fought againts Milosevic in the begging than later was on his side, and Seselj hated Arkan. Seselj also never knew Mladic but was in very good relations with Karadzic etc. Bosnian Muslims also had two ""currents"" one on the side of Alija Izetbegovic and the other current was led by Fikret Abdic. It's a mess of complicated interpersonal relations, big egos, psychos, war opportunists and regular people who had terrible fate to be cough in the middle of all this. So, yeah it is easy for me to imagine that Milosevic or anyone else from Serbia had no clue what Mladic is going to do, and that Mladic didn't give two shits what Milosevic was saying, especially since the Srebrenica massacre, a part from being horrible war crime, was also idiotic move from purely strategic point of view, and totally unneeded.

""social dividend"" planned for 2014, efforts have been made to widen the scope of unemployment benefits to the
long-term unemployed and to widen access of the uninsured to health services through health passports. In
addition, a *minimum income guarantee scheme* is being launched on a pilot basis in two municipalities. It is
intended that this scheme will be rolled-out across the country in phased manner, starting in 2015. It will be a
key component of the country’s new strategy for social welfare, which will be based on a comprehensive review,
consolidation and better targeting of all existing benefits to ensure a fiscally sustainable, more efficient and
effective allocation reaching those most in need.

&gt; A guaranteed minimum income scheme is being created. It will start on a pilot basis in two areas of
the country and a phased-in national roll-out should start in the course of 2015, depending on the
availability of financing. This sequential approach is justified by the need to develop and test the
scheme on its various dimensions, ranging from eligibility criteria and selection beneficiaries, to
determination of benefits and the activation of the beneficiaries, to setting the administrative
infrastructure, including an effective monitoring and controlling mechanism. An integration of the
guaranteed minimum income scheme with other social benefits and services is envisaged. Before
advancing to the national roll-out, the pilot experiences will be evaluated by March 2015, to fine-tune
the design of the scheme. The World Bank is assisting the Greek authorities in the implementation of
the pilots.

Humanitarian aid almost exclusively benefits poor people. Money does not.

&gt; You can be sure that the upper-middle class has largely moved their money into foreign bank accounts by now. A Grexit will not substantially hurt their balances. The people that would lose their savings to devaluation are almost exclusively the middle and lower-middle classes.

Capital flow controls can counter effect that somewhat. The upper-middle class still lives in Greece and will need that money sometime. So then a Greek state can tax the hell out of that back transfer. Also upper-middle class wages will be devalued more in absolute terms than the wage of a lower-middle class Greek.

&gt; A Grexit would be devastating to the Greek economy

Short term there is no realistic option I'm aware of that would not do that. Long term, well, Greece is the most exploited country in the Euro. For them to get rid of the Euro is a very good solution. (Being in the Euro cripples the Greek economy more than it does help it. Makes it too dependent on imports, exports not being priced competitively. Tourism their main ""product"" is more expensive compared to their neighbor Turkey for example, reducing the number of tourists thus reducing their income.)

It's like the US population is partly responsible for the 2008 crash. Ultimatively it was THEM who bought tons of stuff with rate-payments.

Also Greek is 150th out of 183 nation in ease to do business. You can hardly blame businesses if Greece has pretty much none. Or at least: Greece has either small family businesses or big business, there is nothing in between in the private sector (because of restrictions by the state, hence the 150th place) and is thus replaced by the public sector.

And while the ""in between"" in terms of sice sounds rather vague, the middle sized companies are the most important ones to almost any healthy eceonomy. In Germany these companies employ about 80% of all people in the private sector.

- ""Kendji"" is the number one best selling singer in France at the moment. He's Roma. [He use Roma music that he mixes up with pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uG6E6bVKU0), not my cup of tea, but very successful.

- My Sister had roma friends, from a specific group (I don't know the name of their ethnicity). They were nice people. Never met them but they have jobs and even houses. They were perfectly integrated, but still active in their gypsy community. They participate in the pilgrimage of ""Saintes Maries de la Mer"", which draws a lot of tourists and cultural events. It's quite popular in the South of France.


The negatives:

- Now, the only Roma people I've ever met were scamers in Paris, children-pickpockets in the subway during the day instead of being in schools, Roma teen girls with fake petitions who tried to steal my wallet more than once. Roma teen girls smocking in the metro, yelling and assaulting passengers...

null,false,thetarget3,DENK,Denmark,null,"Oh boy, does r/Europe looove to talk about Romas. I hope you get time to read through all the replies OP. Anyways I have some experiences myself to add.

I have probably had more interaction with Romas than most people here. I do musical cooperation with several Roma groups from many different places. I have lived with Romas in Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia, and also know groups from Bulgaria, Spain etc. I have visited them several times, and have also performed at an international Gypsy music and dance festival travelling through Hungary and Slovakia, together with groups from all over Europe.

My experience lines up with what most people here say - that there are basically two groups. The Gypsies we know in Romania live in normal houses, go to school, have jobs etc. They are basically integrated members of society, even though they still have their own culture. For example they live in clans. Each clan has a chieftain. A clan usually lives together in a street, and they don't really have interactions with the other clans - in fact they seem to dislike them, and say that we shouldn't go to the other streets where another clan lives. 

The chieftain has the largest house, which also has the best amenities, like a flush toilet and no pigs in the back yard. The other people usually live more poorly, in what can be described as semi-medieval conditions (at least from my perspective). The people we know there are pretty normal members of society. For example the chieftains son is a chef, who immigrated to Denmark with our help and holds a normal job.

The people we know in Hungary are pretty different. They also live in a mainly Gypsy ghetto. They live from performing music and dance, as well as small jobs and crime. You should really check out Gypsy music, it is hands down amazing! A mixture of European and Middle Eastern music, always with a high tempo and often accompanied by nasal singing, off-tempo clapping and very complicated dances. Usually they mix European scales with Middle Eastern rythms. They are really good musicians too. 

But many of the people are criminals as well. For example one guy runs a prostitution ring in Switzerland, where he presses girls into prostituting. Another is a major arms smuggler. They of course also do petty thievery and break-ins, so they fit the stereotype pretty well. 

They are usually poorly educated if at all. It is seldom for them to know English. 

Lastly there are also the random Gypsies you encounter where I live. They live in camps outside of the city, and spend most of the day begging or doing crime. I have several times almost gotten things stolen by them. 

Sorry that this was a bit rambling. It is only the surface of what I know, so please feel free to ask if you want to know more about my experience with their culture or life.

Anyway, to answer your question, you are genetically half-Roma, but not culturally. Ethnicity isn't the crucial point when it comes to Roma issues in Europe, culture is. That culture comes from two things : the poverty that a majority of Roma live in, and their ancestral nomadic lifestyle. These things are linked, and the Roma resort to crime as a way to get out of poverty when their lifestyle means they can't hold a job or that kind of things. Roma who lift themselves out of poverty and/or settle down in one place have very little problems and are indistinguishable from the wider population.

“We can take on the task to truly lead the country to a European direction, on condition that the Greeks—those who are living well, not those who are suffering—will make the necessary sacrifices,” the finance minister wrote.

Without market's trust, interest goes up and it becomes hard or even impossible to finance government expenditure. That in turn often means implementing austerity measures to avoid complete bankruptcy or to regain trust. A defaulting country may also face international pressure to pay.

null,false,Derbedeu,EURO,European Union,null,"I've a couple of experiences with the Rromani people. None of them were good. One tried to steal some of my luggage at the train station. Others (two girls) tried to scam me into giving them money in front of a church (they were chased off by a priest). Some kids (literally kids, like 8-11 years old) asked for money for a ""parking space"" in what was a public street literally in the center of town. Seeing as how I was renting the car I didn't want to come back to it to find it smashed up. I also couldn't find any other parking (I was visiting a museum), so I grudgingly paid them off. The most serious one involved a kid who held a knife to my throat after I confronted him for being a jackass (I was playing football with some friends and the kid kept stealing the ball and interrupting our game; and this was after we had invited him to join us and he declined). I called his bluff. It was a stupid but calculated risk as he was by himself and there were around 5 of us. So yeah, not all good experiences and none were initiated by me. I don't doubt that the reason they targeted me is because I came off as a tourist since I'm an expat.

Having said all this, I'm not prejudicial towards individual Rroma. They are to a large extent not at fault for this. Their culture on the other hand is another matter all together. 

Rromani culture from what I can tell is literally like a cycle of abuse. The kids are extracted from school and don't receive any education. Instead, they're put to work thieving, stealing, or begging. It's even worse for their women since they are married off in their early teens (sometimes the girls are barely into their adolescence). And as other have mentioned, they are ostracized not only by society, but by their own people should they dare turn their backs on their ""ways"".

Is then any surprise that they grow up to do the same exact thing their parents did? That they continue to inflict this abuse on the next generation? In essence these Rromani were never given a chance in childhood. 

This lack of integration isn't exclusive to just them. For example you see can see it in some 2nd generation Muslims, or in some Orthodox Jewish communities. Integration is staved off through a heavy mix of tradition, culture, community, and religion. And of course, any state intervention (such as taking the kids from the family and placing them in a foster home) is met with charges of racism, which makes the governments tentative to take any concrete action.

IMO this PC notion of ""respecting cultures"" is quite honestly not only propagating the problem, but is racist in itself. People shouldn't be immune to outside pressures to change just because of their ""cultures"" or ""traditions"" and exceptions shouldn't be granted to them because of this. Just because it's been the way you've been living your life for hundreds of years doesn't make it anymore acceptable in today's day and age. Furthermore, saying that it's their culture and therefore it should be respected is akin to saying that ""they don't know any better, let them be"". It's utterly patronizing.

Therefore the answer lies in stopping the coddling that goes on towards different cultures and traditions among closed communities, and a heavy emphasis on *education*. It's not exactly a secret that the most educated of a group tend to be the ones escape the herd mentality that plagues these types of close-minded communities, and go on to succeed in life.",null,0,null,1436704217,null,0,false,0,ct0lvw6,null,t3_3cz6s2,null,t1_ct0lvw6,null,t3_3cz6s2,null,null,null,1440484691,null,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4,null

There is no doubt about that, these need to stop. If Eurozone imposed policies to combat those I would be 100% in favor of them.

Also nochmal ausführlich für dich.

&gt;Stimmt da gibt es viele andere Kommentare. Zumindest ist mir nicht ganz klar, warum du grad diesen sehr abweisenden Kommentar als deinen ""Ausgangspunkt"" dargestellt hast.

Ich habe auf reddit nach atacama humanoid gesucht, da ich bis auf den wiki artikel nichts kannte.

Ein ergebnis war oben verlinkter Post.

Dort bin ich auf verlinktes Kommentar gestoßen, indem widerlegt wurde dass es ein Alien war. Ergo mein Ausgangspunkt, von dem ich weiter recherchiert habe. Passt das? Ich habe es verlinkt, damit man nachvollziehen kann, wie ich darauf gestoßen bin, weil das Thema öfters auch auf Reddit besprochen wurde.

&gt;Eine Untersuchiung von Prof. Ralph Lachmann von der Stanford University, kommt zu dem Ergebnis:

&gt;Most interestingly , based on knee epiphyseal standards, the specimen appears to be 6-8 years of age.

Artikel von grenz wissenschaft aktuell, wie oben verlinkt. Interview war nach der Studie und der Doku, von der du alle deine Argumente ziehst.

&gt;Since the documentary movie ""Sirius"" showed the first results of an investigation of a just 15 centimetres tall little mummy discovered in the Atacama Desert, analysed in depth by medics and geneticist of Stanford University, **it created heavy controversies and misconceptions** about what those (preliminary) results truly meant for an understanding of the specimen as well as about **what the participating scientists think it is**. To clear some of that confusion the German daily fringe-science news- portal ""GreWi.de"" (grenzwissenschaft-aktuell.de) **asked Dr. Garry Nolan**, the Stanford-Geneticist who conducted and still conducts the investigation of the so-called ""Atacama Humanoid"" (or in short ""Ata"") to give an update on the state of his research and investigation.

Der allererste Satz der allerersten Antwort von Nolan:

&gt;First it would be wrong to interpret that **either Dr. Lachman or I** ""concluded"" anything about the age of the specimen

Die Doku war reine Spekulation, keine Faktendarstellung.

&gt;with the full understanding that I was giving the viewers ""dynamic"" speculation over time of my interpretations of the specimen

Weiter dazu:

&gt;As such, one has to **consider**, **accept** and then **sometimes later reject, conclusions** as new evidence appears.

Hier verneint er seine Aussagen: 

&gt;My early statement on camera that this (being) might have been eating, breathing and living is no longer a conclusion I feel strongly about.

Und er wiederholt:

&gt;the tenet and basis of the documentary approach was to hear me ""speculate"" - **not conclude**

Und zum Alter der Knochen:

&gt;The bone results are the only thing right now that suggests it is older. **“Suggest” does not equal “prove”**. That the bone epiphyses **are “apparently” 6-8 years** does **not “prove” it was 6-8 years**.

Es könnte viele Gründe haben, wieso es anscheinend 6-8 Jahre alt ist.

&gt; It just makes the question worth answering as to “why” the bones look older. Is it an **artifact of the mummification or drying process**? Some **new form of rapid aging**? I don’t know and I suspect we won’t ever truly know without a lot more work. 

Zu möglichen gründen:

&gt;Thus, the problem might be a polygenic or other disorder such as an environmental teratogen (birth defects caused by environmental causes like chemicals, teratogenic materials, viruses and/or ionising radiation.)

&gt;I have had several emails from equally prominent paleo-anthropologists and MDs who think it's a different disorder altogether

Er steht nicht unter Druck, sondern ist im Diskurs mit anderen Wissenschaftlern, um eine Lösung zu finden. Deine Behauptungen sind vollkommen haltlos.

Zur Herkunft:

&gt;While I am open minded about the result, I think it is safe to now conclude this **specimen is, without a doubt, human.**

No I don't, and no I certainly didn't.  I said the very opposite.  Lots and lots of people do it, increasingly so, with no negative stereotype attached.  That was the point.   That you can even be a traveller and still escape all negative associated stereotypes by simply moderating your behaviour - as I'm sure many Roma do.  That the issue is then people stop willingly associating them with Roma but just regular campsite folk.  That the problem is people unfairly associate negative perceived behaviour as Roma but don't readily identify them when they're behaving like other socially-integrated travellers.

I even have people who regularly stay with me when travelling down to Winter in Portugal as I have enough land to pitch up and serve as a convenient halfway point to rest up for a few days/weeks.  There is absolutely no stigma attached, and nor did I give you cause to think I did attach any.  

There is no way to differentiate between a permanent traveller, Roma, or middleclass retiree off on an extended camping holiday if they all act respectfully, and with no negative perceptions attached.  Just as there is no way to differentiate ethnically who is Roma and who is not when integrated, where you could walk past them in the street and have no way of knowing, then similarly I could drive past a caravan and have no way of knowing if they've been travelling for a week, a season, a year, or a lifetime.  If they're playing/camping by the rules and respectful of their surroundings then nobody knows a Roma home from any other suburban nuclear family with a caravan on holiday or happy traveller.  There's no way of knowing.  There can be no animosity to a Roma family unless they identify themselves in the eyes of others by a negative stereotype, and unfortunately for them if they don't then nobody knows to credit them as being a *positive* example of integrated Roma.",null,0,null,1436705251,null,0,1436705538,0,ct0m677,null,t3_3cz6s2,null,t1_ct0m677,null,t1_ct0l795,null,null,null,1440484825,null,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6,null

In this case, trust is important to a loan agreement and the rhetoric and actions of the Greeks over the past year certainly have hurt trust.

null,false,RubiksCoffeeCup,null,null,null,"The precise problem is that economics is often counter-intuitive, as is human behaviour. Austerity, for example, sounds great from a common-sense perspective, but states are not private households. Austerity depresses an economy. People have less money to spend, depressing the economy further, and overall decreasing tax revenue. This decrease in revenue for the government is larger than the money saved through austerity measures, so that the government's liquidity is threatened. The depressed economy also raises the debt-to-GDP-ratio. Then it spirals out of control. Does this happen to you? When you save money by not spending it and instead using it to pay back your debt, is the end result of this that your debt will *increase*? Economics is counter-intuitive. Of course that's simplified.

All this happened in Greece. The Greek problem in 2008/2009 after the recession was a problem, but it wasn't a catastrophe yet. Due to various circumstances, of which austerity is only one, albeit large, it has now become one. Look at relevant graphs and how they behave after the introduction of austerity.

Austerity isn't a bad thing. It's good when countries can afford to lower their overall debt and interest rates. But doing this after a recession is probably a bad thing. Those countries with austerity programs who are allegedly ""success stories"" mostly still are below the GDP they had before austerity. Poverty is still higher than it used to be.

Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann says that German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble wants Greece out of the euro zone. However, Reuters [chooses to ommit](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/07/11/uk-eurozone-greece-austria-idUKKCN0PL0NW20150711) this crucial part of the interview.

[Click here](http://pastebin.com/mVPzGcYi) for the full text of the interview ([imgur copy](http://i.imgur.com/g5N46bM.png), [Google translation](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&amp;depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://pastebin.com/mVPzGcYi&amp;usg=ALkJrhiTUbmi5qlK-p3KTR8xvKoWn2y7EQ)).

Excerpt:

&gt; ÖSTERREICH: Wird es heute ein Happy End für die Griechen geben?
 
&gt; Faymann: Dass wir alle EU- Staaten heute zu einem positiven Finale bewegen – das wird eine Riesen-Herausforderung. Denn der Riss in dieser Frage geht quer durch Europa. Oder nehmen Sie die Unterschiede in Deutschland: **Der deutsche Finanzminister will die Griechen ernsthaft aus dem Euro drängen**, die deutsche Kanzlerin dagegen ist sehr bemüht, eine konstruktive Lösung zu finden. Und so ist das in vielen Ländern.

Faymann also says that Austria (and by extension other countries) benefit from the Greek crisis. The interest rate for a ten-year bond is 1.14% and this saved Austria €2.2bn from the 2016 budget. This amount is also higher than what Austria would be liable for, according to Austria's ESM share and what Greece asked for.

They aren't. They are simply not paying extra for every child above two. You can have as many as you want, but you will have to pay yourself.

I'm not sure how many they were but at least two old and fat parents, a ~30 yo daughter and maybe a baby. And sometimes others slept there but I'm really not sure.  
The day they were all dispatched in the city to beg money near cafés or boulangeries. They stayed there all day waiting for money. I sometimes gave money to the young woman near my bar-tabac. At 08:00pm a local NGO gave them food and water if they wanted it near the trainstation.  
After that they just went to the courtyard to sleep. Here's the thing : I rarely heard them, they never did any kind of noises. They never bothered me or anyone living around the courtyard, and the police never came there. They just wanted to have some (crappy) place to sleep in. Sometimes they did some kind of party but never after 10:00pm. The other times I heard them were when they were arguing with each others and crying, probably about their crappy condition.

C'est la stratégie MLP oui. Ils sont malins ils ont vu que le lobby juif était trop puissant médiatiquement. Pour rappel JMLP avait fait la même chose en allant au congrès juif mondial et en se faisant des potes au B'nai Brith... Juste avant l'affaire du ""détail"".

Euro countries are now at the point that they increase demands because their trust in Greece is completely gone. They don't want to throw their money in this bottomless pit that does not even appreciate their efforts, hence the latest demands.

The Eurogroup isn't some super body. By official law, it's an informal entity. They don't even take minutes there. They can only meet, make decisions by consensus, and then apply those decisions to formal structures.

Even if everyone said 'Grexit is go' they'd still have to change the treaties using the formal process, which means lots of countries like Ireland for example require a Referendum. 

It's definitely not some 'yes it is that simple' situation. Even other parties in Germany are saying the request is unconstitutional.

&gt; And the ESM is not a viable way of going about this. Its point is not to circumvent the democratic processes of the Eurozone.

The ESM is the only viable way of doing this, in line with the articles that established it. In fact, what IS being negotiated is all within the purview of the ESM and the process of invoking it.

If you don't think that's democratic enough, then you're argument is with the ESM and those who designed it, not with Greece.

&gt; I firmly believe that if Greece had simply come to the table with the deal they're offering now about two months ago an agreement would have most likely been found with some slight adjustments.

That wasn't at all related to the point you quote. I refer to Germany telling Greeks that they need to consider the right party and then elect the right party in their elections, in February, otherwise their might be trouble. This did not simply fail to be noticed, it did happen and caused some diplomatic issues.

&gt;  Doesn't change the current situation.

We are truly into the region of insanity if the road to this point is something nobody will consider in figuring out in what direction to take the next step. It's not some intractable problem; the indices were there and Greece was totally captive to the policy of the Creditors.

How much have they received?  I was under the impression that it was in the neighborhood of a hundred billion euro.

That isn't always a good thing.  More depositors means more people that you have to cover if there is a run on the banks.

&gt;Moreover Greek depositors didn't face a haircut.

...because Greek banks have been propped up to this point.  If the ECB doesn't give any additional funds and refuses to roll over the current loans, the Greek depositors will certainly face a haircut as the banks simply don't have enough money to honor all of them.

&gt;Of course they collapse without the deal.Thats why the problem is mainly politic...

Well in that case, the Cypriot bank problems were political as well.  If they had been able to reach a bailout deal that was large enough to protect them, they wouldn't have failed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Papandreou#The_.22Change.22

&gt;At the Greek legislative election, 1981, PASOK won a landslide victory over the conservative New Democracy party, and Papandreou became Greece's first socialist prime minister. The party's main slogan was Allagi (change).

&gt;In office, Papandreou backtracked from much of his campaign rhetoric and followed a more conventional approach. Greece did not withdraw from NATO, United States troops and military bases were not ordered out of Greece, and Greek membership in the European Economic Community continued, **largely because Papandreou proved very capable of securing monetary aid for Greece. In domestic affairs, Papandreou's government immediately carried out a massive programme of wealth redistribution upon coming into office that immediately increased the availability of entitlement aid to the unemployed and lower wage earners. Pensions, together with average wages and the minimum wage, were increased in real terms**, and changes were made to labour laws which up until 1984 made it difficult for employers to make workers redundant. The impact of the PASOK Government’s social and economic policies was such that it was estimated in 1988 that two-thirds of the decrease in inequality that occurred in Greece between 1974 and 1982 took place between 1981 and 1982.

&gt;**During its time in office, Papandreou's government carried through sweeping reforms of social policy by introducing a welfare state,** significantly expanding welfare measures, expanding health care coverage (the ""National Health System"" was instituted, which made modern medical procedures available in rural areas for the first time,) promoting state-subsidized tourism for lower-income families, index-linking pensions, and funding social establishments for the elderly. Rural areas benefited from improved state services, the rights and income of low paid workers were considerably improved, and refugees from the Civil War living in exile were allowed to return with impunity.


&gt;**The expenditure programme of the Papandreou government during 1981–1990 has been described as excessive by its conservative critics.** The excessive expenditures were not accompanied by corresponding revenue increases and this led to increases in budget deficits and the public debt. Many economic indicators worsened during 1981–1990 and the economic policies of his government were condemned as a failure by his critics.


As a result.

null,false,the_straylight_run,null,null,null,"&gt; No, a Euro printed by a national central bank (NCB) without the ECB's authorisation is not legal.

I'm not sure what you are trying to get at here. 

The quote of mine you referenced says the exact same thing as the point you make about it. I never argued the printing of bank notes can be done by NCBs without ECB permission, or that thwarting that process would be legal. So there's nothing to 'correct' about my argument. 

In fact, you then agree with said argument about them not being counterfeit.

I have never said that what Greece would do in this extreme scenario would be legal, from an ECB perspective. Within Greece, it would be legal, as delivered under the powers of legislation they draft for emergency circumstances. Outside Greece, the ECB would certainly look at the printing as being 'rogue' or illegal, as would the other heads of the EC and EU institutions.

But that's beside the point. Greece will have already determined in its own position that the ECB is itself behaving illegally and outside its mandate, and that the breaking of the law by Greece is necessary to restore the situation to where it should legally be. 

I mean that situation is possible even now: the ECB is being sued in the ECJ for what is tantamount to negligence in performing its duties as mandated, and the relief and injunction sought by the plaintiff include forcing the ECB to immediately extend and support Greece by authorising the printing of Euros by the CBG and the extending of ELA reserves digitally.

In other words, giving performance to what would already be happening in Greece.

We can argue about the ramifications politically, or the legality if you'd like. But you cannot continue with this totally one-sided view that the ECB cannot act illegally and that Greece will simply be bound to whatever the Troika decide, no matter how they arrive at those decisions.",null,0,null,1436708446,null,0,1436714055,0,ct0n6dr,null,t3_3cynmt,null,t1_ct0n6dr,null,t1_ct0hq9f,null,null,null,1437792783,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Non, je sais que ça à toujours été le bordel, c'est ce qui rends la chose intéressante. T'en fais pas hein, des torchons communistes j'en ai rencontré aussi.

Le Gud c'est des antifas de droite non ? Pour moi ça a juste vocation à être un service d'ordre pas cher, ça vole pas très haut.
&gt;C'est la stratégie MLP oui. Ils sont malins ils ont vu que le lobby juif était trop puissant médiatiquement. Pour rappel JMLP avait fait la même chose en allant au congrès juif mondial et en se faisant des potes au B'nai Brith... Juste avant l'affaire du ""détail"". Le vieux bougre a du mal à baisser les yeux, un peu trop gaulois ou breton quoi.

Oui enfin franchement, le lobby juif c'est une belle exagération quand même. Oui qu'une communauté homogène se structure pour défendre ses intérêts ça me surprend pas, après de là à aller dans tout les délires ils contrôlent le monde et tout... J'ai l'impression ils servent surtout de méchants pour une communauté obsédée par la nation. Les juifs sont toujours une anti-France facile à construire.

Un peu comme la gauche qui hurlait ""bourgeois"" partout, comme un adjectif pour dire ""pas bien"". Bien sur t'as une base derrière mais au final ça sert juste de qualification pour ce qui est mal.


&gt;Nan c'est très loin d'être le cas mais le rapport de force et la force des médias sur une campagne ne laisse pas le choix. Faut voir qui sont les réacs autorisés sur les grands médias : Zemmour, Finkielkraut, Elisabeth Lévy, tu n'as pas un seul gaulois autorisé à défendre la France. Dès qu'il y en a un il se fait dégager, regarde Millet ou Renaud Camus ils sont sur liste noire.

Le problème c'est que je pense que structurellement l'antisémitisme peut pas aller très loin, parce que c'est pas les juifs qui ont le pouvoir. Si un jour il se rapproche du pouvoir à un moment il faudra bien se rendre compte que c'était exagéré et il sera plus possible d'aller plus loin. Tout comme l'Holocauste, ça peut réunir un certain temps mais après la seule solution sera de mentir.

Pourquoi Zemmour Lévy et tout sont pas bons ? Leur pensée est mauvaise ?

While germany and the nothern EU countries are the biggest payers in the EU, they are under the biggest receivers  for decades, no one complained about that, those were not debts but money given to them to improve their infrastructure, what have they done with it ??

Another thing that people seem to forget is that germany is not the only country, that has problems with their policy. Ask Euro countries that are even poorer than greece, like Estland, Latvia, Slovakia... be surprised of their answers, if you tell them they should give greece money, without structural reforms in greece and even if the greeks say they do it a lot of trust is lost to believe they will really do what the say. Well maybe the german government should just wave the demand of greece through and let the others handle it. It will be a lot of fun to see how they handle the situation with partners where they can not use the WW2 card. 

With structural reforms I am not talking about austerity, I am talking about just fucking collecting taxes properly.  I was fucking surprised that the first thing you expect from a left government was not done, erasing the exemption of the richest greece people (the shipping agents (Reeder)) from their constitution and collect taxes from them.If they had done all that ,I think many in the EU would be willing to drop a lot of austerity demands. But no it so easy to accuse others to be responsible for the problems of greece instead of doing something themselve. They also say they had no time to do that, oh well they had time to make a lot of show, they had enough time to plan stuff while they were in the opposition otherwise you could ask where was their program and not everybody in the goverment is involved in negotiations with the eurogroup, you have to fucking delegate stuff.

And now to the IWF that is demanding a debt cut.  There are no repayments to the EU in the next couple of years and the interest on them are low so there is enough time to negotiate that. In the mean time greece has to do repayments to the IWF and has problems to do that, but the IWF does not want to do what they want from the EU, to do a debt cut or at least delaying the back payments in the far future. So this demands are hypocryte. IWF take your own medicine as a good example otherwise shut your mouth.

So now to the EU side, it was fucking stupid idea to take over the debts from the banks. It is stupid to make countries debtors and creditors of each other, that only creates problems, If banks invest stupid let them fail. It is even stupider that we do not build something where the sentence they are to big to fail is not true anymore. 

I am for a debt cut or at least delaying repayments in the far future and setting the interests to zero, but it is not easy to tell your taxpayers something like that, if they know that greece is not collecting taxes from the wealthiest people in the country, everybody can understand that poor people are allowed to pay in installments but wealthy people no that can not be understood.

I am also pretty much for an investment packet for the economy in greece and other EU countries (some kind of Marshall program), but no more money in the hands of the governments instead directly in those of people who want to start new business. Also delivering aid through sending them medicine and other stuff they desparately need and can not pay, for free for a certain time period, directly without involvement of their government, I do not want things to get lost on they way to the people that need it.

null,false,the_straylight_run,null,null,null,"&gt; No, only the ECB can issue euros.

The ECB doesn't issue Euros. It issues *authorisation* to NCBs to print Euros. Big difference.

At the minute the case being taken to the ECJ essentially argues that the political stability or national solvency of a state has no bearing on the solvency of its private institutions. That is to say that the extension of ELA to private banks in the system has nothing to do with how Greece is negotiating or how its creditors are feeling. 

The application makes a great point: 'like in the Schroedinger's cat scenario, Greece's banking system cannot be both solvent and insolvent at the same time'. If the banks are solvent, but illiquid, which everyone is saying is the case, there is NO case where ELA can be withheld from them, as per ECB treaty. This is true because the conditions under which ELA is applicalble, liquidity shortage, are self-correcting once the bankrun ends. 

As to whether or not the state would ultimately be considered Rogue, it will likely be decided in the ECJ, and whatever suspension of trade links that happened ordered to resume by injunction. It's not just a simple 'ECB is always right'; who was correct and who was incorrect will be determined by verdict rather than by assumption.

And the ECB is highly likely to be shown to be behaving illegally or outside it's mandate, which means steps taken by Greece to remedy this breach are likely to be considered acceptable and necessary under the circumstances.

So you don't see the cartoon as racist at all? Maybe you think it is accurate? Protip: this makes you the racist. 

&gt;This is the part where you're supposed to explain what's different.

Not liking the German government's proscriptions and positions in this and railing against it as it destroys your country is a little bit different from publishing cartoons that are made to resemble anti-Semitic propaganda with a different target. 

&gt;No? I'm accusing you of violating the rules of good faith arguing constantly.

You sure did an excellent job of that when you jumped into the conversation with this stunning piece of rhetorical wizardry:
&gt;Ya okay, the side you're not on is made up of totally misinformed and utterly racist morons, great analysis. You struck a blow for the oppressed today. Why don't you fuck off?

The fallacy being that you're assuming what you should prove, you're not explaining what makes his beliefs wrong of themselves.

Pointing out your logical fallacies is doing just that. You have yet to provide any position to argue against other than that I should 'fuck off' and that a racist cartoon isn't racist. Meanwhile, I've posted actual positions and actual things that have happened, and you've been unable to address them directly, instead accusing me of ad hominem attacks and using for your examples things I didn't say, while projecting some other meaning onto what I actually said.

A volte sono ore in cui ci si conosce meglio con gli altri componenti della classe.

Garantito, un po' di religione ce la fa fare, ma nel senso che ci istruisce su cosa pensa la Chiesa riguardo, ad esempio, i metodi contraccettivi, il valore del matrimonio o su cosa cambia con le altre religioni. E comunque ci fa parlare ed esprimere le nostre opinioni.

Sono comunque ore interessanti e non abbiamo mai comprato un libro o fatto compiti in classe.

Sinceramente io non la chiamerei nemmeno ora di Religione (spesso), sarebbe più un'ora di dibattito e cultura generale (?) forse.

The Greeks have built a rotten house for close to 35 years. 

http://i.imgur.com/jClznB9.png

And expected help from the EU. The idea of a bailout was never ""charity/free money"" that greeks thought it was. 

It was simply to help you out of your crisis not ""do everything for me!!!!""

If this was just due to the financial crisis in 2008. It would of been easier, except the greece nation has been so corrupt that nobody knew the extent of the corruption, the dysfunction and the general lack of a functional economy. 

An economy which has depended a lot on borrowing from the outside while expecting that if they ever got in trouble that the EU would pay for them. 

Now Greeks themselves doesn't want to take the measures that deflates this unsustainable economy. And yet just a week after rejecting terms that were actually much easier last week than the most recent. By a referendum you come back asking for more money.

Before: We don't want your stupid money!!! Im going to align with my buddy russia!!

Now: Please don't leave me!!! also If you don't forgive my debt and give me more money im going to throw more temper tantrums so hand over the money!!

I'm perfectly fine with greece being forced to fend for themselves outside of the EZ. If thats what it takes for greeks to realize that their problems is not a foreign conspiracy but created from themselves. Besides the last real conspiracy which was the US links with the Junta. Your people are blaming the junta for the debt, when ironically compared to post-1981 Greece **they kept the debt ratio low**. In other words: they didn't create the junta nobody how i or anybody else don't like them.

You don't simply want a bailout, you don't really want to clean this dirty house up that has been dirty since 1981. You guys just want a handout so you can ""live like we did before 2008"" while keeping the house dirty.

Lots of Irish, Americans and Spanish do wish they could re-live the prosperity of the Property bubble in the 2000's. But they don't wish for another one to happen since they know it would lead to the same problems. However Greeks want a return to the pre-2008, Spending bubble. Why else are the political flavour in greece is ""anti-austerity"" and not ""Pro-reform""?

Other greeks say that, ""The Troika should of used that money for an investment package so we can get back to where we were pre-2008!!""

NO.

Thats absolutely moral hazard that will be paid by somebody else. If you reward people for going into trouble with that much free money it only gives an incentive for others to do the same. 


Also i keep hearing about people talking about that bailout the banks had in the US. **It wasn't free** they unlike Greece actually **paid back what they were given**. 

http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Pages/TARP-Tracker.aspx#Bank

Out of 250$ bn given by the American government. Those financial institutions gave back 275$ bn. A profit of 25$ bn for the US.

Greece on the otherhand wants money to pay for money they owe. If the eurozone stupidly agrees to a deal today.

Inoltre penso che i tatuatori seri riconoscano lontano un km i clienti modaioli (sono quelli che non sono convinti del soggetto, della posizione ma lo vorrebbero subito -possibilmente in tempo per sfoggiarlo al mare- e a un prezzo di favore) e tentino un pochino di scoraggiarli. Per paradosso, però, questi avranno anche meno problemi sul posto di lavoro per quel che riguarda il tatuaggio, perché difficilmente avranno un disegno molto grande e invasivo tipo un tatuaggio che tiene tutto il braccio. 

Sul fatto che siano nati con la guerra, potrei dissentire, la tradizione è ben più antica, ma io sono la prima ad ammettere che non è che io apprezzo i tatuaggi in quanto antica usanza dei popoli precolombiani. Però non mi tatuo neanche perché l'ho visto in televisione e ommioddio è troppo fighissimo e devo farmene uno a tutti i costi.

1) entriamo con un exploit X


2) le tabelle ARP a quanto ricordi sono la hystory di invio pacchetti (che si può anche flushare se non ricordo male). In pratica se tu a casa tenti di entrare da remoto da un portatile al fisso devono essere mandati determinati pacchetti TCP/ip.. ARP è la tabella dove ad ogni mac address corrisponde un IP della sottorete. Avvelenandola credo intendano falsificarla, non so come, in modo che al router sembra di star inviando pacchetti dal PCa al PCb ma in realtà magari vengono inviati al PCc o prima di essere inviati passano da un terzo soggetto (il programma di sniff?)
Questo è quello che ricordo ma mi posso sbagliare anzi sicuramente sto confondendo qualcosa.


3) l'eth0 rappresenta al 99% dei computer casalinghi la prima scheda di rete wired (con il cavo in sostanza). Sniff tradotto banalmente è quella cosa che si fa quando si resta in ascolto su una determinata porta. Esempio se ti colleghi in SSH da un PC A a B se è attivo uno sniffer sulla porta 22(classica porta SSH) tutto il traffico tra A e B verrà loggato e inviato/visto da chi ha attivato lo sniff. Inject è invece iniettare qualcosa in un determinato momento su un determinato indirizzo IP e porta (credo anche contemporaneamente su più target ma non ne sono sicuro)


4)proviamo gli attacchi è proprio quello che dice, bisogna vedere quali attacchi.


5)secondo lui si può fare solo tramite wired connection ovvero con il filo.. E non wireless. Perchè non so, non conosco i loro programmi .

Why don't they borrow from private lenders now to spend their way out of the slump? Simple answer; because they can't.

Apparently, there is more than just 1 article, so here is it:

Article 122:

1. Without prejudice to any other procedures provided for in the Treaties, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may decide, in a spirit of solidarity between Member States, upon the measures appropriate to the economic situation, in particular if severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products, notably in the area of energy.

2. Where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may grant, under certain conditions, Union financial assistance to the Member State concerned. The President of the Council shall inform the European Parliament of the decision taken.

Apparently, because the European system is a civil law system, an action needs *explicit approval* from the law in order to be legal. Thus the wording of the treaty is interpreted as ""[Only] where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control, the Council [...] may grant [...] Union financial assistance to the Member State concerned."" I am not aware of the full details, (*some Germans would help me plox*), but if France had been able to do it alone or with Italy, they would have done it already.

Every movie on TV is dubbed, and if you look at the cinema programs, you'll see that almost no movies are shown in English, only the blockbusters which are shown in several halls at once.

I know a lot of people who are very good at English, some even speak it so well that I couldn't tell them apart from a native speaker, and they still usually watch the dubbed versions. I think it's because of laziness, as you still have to concentrate a bit more on what they're saying if it's in another language. Also, if you grew up with dubbed movies you're just used to it. It doesn't sound weird to you, it's totally normal, so why watch it in another language? The thought doesn't even cross most people's minds.

Also before i have to hear the same junk.

The IMF and nordics gave Iceland a bailout the equivalent of 30% of Their GDP which was used to nationalize some banks and recapitalize them and and shut down privatize others.

http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=anS9Ze0bmXmM

&gt; Iceland got a $4.6 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund and four Nordic countries to help resurrect the island's economy after the failure of its biggest banks and the collapse of its currency.

&gt; Iceland will use the money to stabilize the krona, shore up its banks and restore confidence, the IMF said. The country, which had the fifth-highest per capita income in the world last year, needs the financing to pay for imports and to create enough foreign reserves to support a free-floating currency.

**Any country that has gotten 30% of the equivalent of their GDP would obviously do better**.

If iceland didnt get that money then their economy would of crashed even further which doesn't appeal to the people who come here with the preconceived notion that  ""iceland just let the banks failed, got no help and they recovered!!! yadda yadaa yadaa!!!""

null,false,Rusiu,nativespeaker,"Native, armchair linguist",null,"Everyone is just saying you ""*während* is a Genitive preposition"".

To understand, why the Genitive is used here, I will explain you the nature of the Genitive.

As you might know, the Genitive answers to the question *wessen?*, or *whose?* in English. But what does that word ""wessen/whose"" mean? In English it does mean, what you know. But also in German, all speakers think of possessions. But that wouldn't explain why there are verbs, adjectives and prepositions needing the Genitive.

The Genitive answers to the question *in Bezug auf wen/was?*, or in English: *in reference to whom/what?*.

The preposition *während* comes from the verb *währen* (**to last**) and is its past participle. *lasting in reference to whom/what*

*Während meines Jobs sprachen sie mit mir*.

Today the usage of *während* is of course different than in the time, where the people still could remember what the etymology of *während* is. Today we use *während* as a location in time. That's why more and more people start to say *während meinem Job*, using the Dative. Because the Dative is used to describe locations.

* *in meinem Haus(e)*
* *auf meinem Dach(e)*
* *unter meinem Bett(e)*
* *über meinem Auto*
* *neben meinem Tisch(e)*

The **e**s in brackets are the archaic Dative-e, a declension marker for the Dative case for strong masculine and neuter nouns, not ending in either a vowel or a Schwa+n/m/l/r combination.

But *links* and *rechts* are always used with the Genitive or with *von+Dative*.

They are, because the ending *-s* in *links* and *rechts* are the Genitive-ending. That's why you have *forward vs. forwards*, *onward vs. onwards*, *toward vs. towards*, *anyway vs. anyways* and many more in English. More examples here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverbial_genitive

On a national level the creditors would have a sit-down with the nation and come up with a plan of debt restructuring that ensures the future solvency of the country. The creditors would have to take some losses and the nation would have to implement policy changes to reduce spending and/or increase revenues.

Creditors, or those that gambled after the 2010 bailout, got a haircut. ~25% iirc. Greece increased revenue and decreased spending from a -11% budget deficit of GDP to around 4% of GDP surplus from 2009-2014. And that while GDP, as in the amount that can be taxed, shrunk by 25%.

So what's missing? The ""that ensures the future solvency of the country"". As has been predicted in 2012, despite the herculean effort of the Greeks, they still have to go beg for more money to pay off debts.

I grew up with little chance at all to watch movies in original let alone TV shows, and I hated it. If it hadn't been for British troops around - were lucky that thanks to friends we had a TV decoder able to receive their TV station. It helped me a lot to get into English and improve it, while at school I struggled learning it. Thankfully over the past two decades things improved with DVD's and movie theaters showing original versions, at least in some places. Not to mention the new possibilities internet offers.

To me it's not just about learning another language. It's not just about translation, if they get the jokes or not (which is always hard to translate even more so when in dubbing), or make the techno babble of scifi shows even worse (oh Star Trek, lol). As big if not sometimes bigger of an issue to me is, that I see one actor act and hear another one act - and no matter how hard they try, and some are good, it is not one and the same. Think how many people couldn't noticed what Liv Taylor did in LoTR with her voice, because they have never heard her original voice. Most people in Germany have no clue of the brilliance of Meryl Streep, they know she is good but they never heard her acting, and she does impressive things with her voice. Or look at how hilarious it is that a film like Her had even in German still Scarlett Johansson as a main character on the poster, but there was in the dubbed version no Scarlett Johansson in the film.

Dubbing is sure good for mainstream consume and brings money, but it hurts the art.

Oh, and those moments, when you discover finally seeing the original version, why a character or actor is thought to be hot, as it happened for me with Jonathan Frakes, Didn't get his sex appeal in the dubbed version, but after I heard his booming basso in original I started to feel it. Or take Avery Brooks as Captain Sisko, in German the character just doesn't work as great.

And then there is the soundtrack. For big block busters things are a bit different, but find it rather noticeable in TV series, it's a different mix, somewhat flat most of the time in German dubbed versions.

&gt; Hence, Syriza has done nothing to regulate the media oligarchs, open up the economy, or introduce meritocracy in the civil service.

To be fair, Syriza is in government for only a few months, spending their efforts mostly on the negotiations, in a very hostile environment for a left government. Any attempt of reforms without a final deal would be considered 'unilateral action' and break negotiations.

It also doesn't stick very well with this:

&gt; Pavlos Eleftheriadis is [...] also active in Greek politics with the new centre-Left political party, To Potami

To Potami is strongly supported by the same oligarchy. Nowhere they have shown a centre-left mindset, probably an attempt to guise the purely neoliberal mantra. Some of its members applaud the creditor's strict stance and Syriza's negotiation failures, despite this being against their nation's interest.

So far, austerity seems to have strengthen this same oligarchy that controls the media. So far, Syriza seemed to be their only real threat.

Also agricultural sectors have been heavily subsidized, although one could argue that that actually decreases competitiveness as it reduces the need for innovation.

&gt;Protip: this makes you the racist. 

Again, assuming what you should prove. 



&gt;Not liking the German government's proscriptions and positions in this and railing against it as it destroys your country is a little bit different from publishing cartoons that are made to resemble anti-Semitic propaganda with a different target. 

Not liking the greece governments position and demands as it asks for yet more money is a little different from publishing cartoons that present the germans as nazis who want to make glue out of greeks. 

And I think it was even published in a syriza newspaper. Otoh, the caricature you object to has nothing to do with the eu negotiating team. 

As to the anti-semitic propaganda, I don't see the connection, except that this is a caricature, and they were caricatures. Maybe you're not familiar with caricatures as done here, being an american who apparently rarely confronts disagreement. 

Most caricatures are not particularly flattering to the caricatured person/group. It's easy to imagine that this guy, in a different context, could be a german tourist in mallorca (they have a bad reputation there: beer-drinking, rude, fat, slobbish, etc). 


I don't see the resemblance between the caricatured greek and the stereotypical caricatured jew.

To give you an example: Greeks generally like their civil code, which was largely based on the German civil code. Its adoption in the 19th was - and still is - considered a huge advancement for the country and the German influence in that regard nothing but helpful. At the same it is also worth mentioning that the reason there was German influence in the first place was because a German king was imposed on Greece as soon as the country gained it's independence. At the same time as that it's *also* worth mentioning that the only reason Greece gained its independence - instead of having one more failed revolution - was because European Philhellenes convinced their governments to intervene at the naval battle of Navarino, which turned the tide of the revolution. But that intervention made the Europeans require a king of their own choosing (bad), which led to the civil code and other possitive influences (good). 

It's a very complicated love/hate relationship that absolutely cannot be summarised as ""the Greeks are too bloody proud to ask for help"".

Edit: Ukraine on the other hand is a bad counterexample, as it has been in Russia's sphere of influence forever.

There is a difference between ""coddling"" and being upfront and direct in stating that the wishes of the people are disastrous and utterly unrealistic solutions.

There is a difference between listening to you and letting that be the sole determining factor in the final decision.

If you think it does, then show where I said I wanted a government to coddle its people.  Otherwise, please move away from the bullshit and back to what I actually said.

I advocate for a representative form of democracy.  A fundamental principle of this is that the representatives are better equipped to make decisions than the populace as a whole.  Therefore, we entrust them to make decisions that may not always be in lockstep with the popular desire of the masses at any given instant.

My question to you is if you actually support representative democracy at all, because it certainly seems that you don't.  That is fine, BTW, but then you should be advocating to completely rip up your constitution and replace it with a direct democracy system.  

If you aren't then it seems that you are saying:

&gt;I want a representative democratic setup except when it happens to be inconvenient to my personal beliefs, in which case I favor a direct democracy if it will give me what I want.

Without air support the Dutch soldiers were helpless, because they only had rifles and pistols against tanks. There's literally nothing the soldiers could have done. Finally, these UN troops were on a peacekeeping mission, so the commander's drinking with Mladic should be seen as what it most likely was: an attempt to deescalate and keep people talking instead of murdering. He said that he regrets nothing more than this, but it doesn't matter IMO. The UN soldiers were not supposed and were not equipped to full-on attack. They're as much the victims as the civilians. And that's why I said your post was stupid - not you, read that again - because it ignores all of that for some bullshit black-and-white narrative.",null,0,null,1436712807,null,0,false,0,ct0ovar,null,t3_3cwb6e,null,t1_ct0ovar,null,t1_cszzi7s,null,null,null,1437793631,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

The scam works by persuading you to pay a deposit before you have actually finalised the deal. Usually, you're asked to pay a deposit to a foreign bank account or some financial institution of some kind, usually suggesting something akin to escrow. You pay it, and then never hear from the ""owner"" ever again. The pictures of the apartment were just pulled from some estate agent's site or a Google image search or something, the photo of the ""owner"" is actually a photo of a previous victim (that's why he wants your photo) and you don't have any contact details except a throwaway e-mail address.

Things you should know:

* Always be very suspicious indeed of any landlord who is apparently abroad.
* It is very, very unusual for any landlord to rent out an apartment without first meeting in person. In fact, because landlords have to be careful about who they rent to, they'll usually insist on it.
* Certainly never agree to rent a place you have not had the chance to view.
* Never pay anything up front until you are in possession of a signed rental contract. This is the single most important thing to bear in mind: neither the deposit nor the first month's rent is actually due until the contract is signed.
* Make sure you have the landlord's address and telephone numbers (cell *and* landline).
* Websites will probably have a link for you to report ads you think might be fraudulant: use it.

&gt;

&gt;The __Sanctus__ ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language): *Sanctus*, ""Holy"") is a [hymn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymn) from [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic) [liturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgy). It may be called the ___epinikios hymnos___ ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language): ἐπινίκιος ὕμνος, ""Hymn of Victory"") when referring to the Greek rendition.

&gt;In [Western Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Christianity), the Sanctus forms part of the [Ordinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_(liturgy\)) and is sung (or said) as the final words of the [Preface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preface_(Liturgy\)) of the [Eucharistic Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharistic_Prayer), the prayer of consecration of the bread and wine. The preface, which alters according to the [season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgical_year), usually concludes with words describing the praise of the worshippers joining with the [angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel), who are pictured as praising God with the words of the Sanctus. In [Byzantine Rite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Rite) Christianity, the Sanctus is offered as a response by the choir during the [Holy Anaphora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_(liturgy\)).

&gt;*Tersanctus* (""Thrice Holy"") is another, rarer name for the Sanctus. The same name is sometimes used for the *[Trisagion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisagion)*.

Crazy stuff did happen connected with Roma. I mean, yes they are humans like all of us and surely there are criminals being Roma, as well. But an arsehole is simply an arsehole because of its behaviour, not because of its ethnicity or something. So like kind of always there is a short truth behind prejudices, but this truth does not refer to ALL of them. I am of course not able to speak for all countries in europe, but I would confirm this for germany (even if I guess in the rest of europe it is not really a different situation..).

There are always some people in society who can't function, just the same as there are people who function at an *incredible* level.

The real mark of a society isn't just how it rewards the latter, but how it takes care of the former.

And to be sure; racism's legacy in the US means that often, the groups of our poor whom people discriminate against get much less help than they ought to receive (and are often harmed!)

I'm sure there are examples of this happening to the Roma in Europe; it's just a bad tendency humans have.

Can you cite me an example for the US? Roma culture centers around this. Sure, you have a some people playing the welfare game, sometimes even to levels that are considered fraudulent but I don't think it's engrained the same way.

The reason I started this comment thread was because the original commenter painted a picture of black america being lazy and telling the government FUCK YOU instead of taking the helping hand and working their way up. My whole point is while that would be very similar to the Roma it's totally wrong. The deck is stacked against poor america whether you are white or black or latino or asian or whatever.

So I don't think it's a matter of the community being lazy or pushing back against society; it's that they don't like being poor because frankly it's shitty; it takes hard, hard work to get out of that position; society doesn't help enough to alleviate the causes of poverty. Some of the reasons we've both mentioned (institutional racism, under-education, criminal law issues) but again the Roma population is different than poor America.

Goldman Sachs wants to establish a new precedence for what happens when a sovereign nation attempts to declare insolvency. They want to put the needs of corporations above that of sovereign nations. 


* Goldman Sachs made $ 10's billions in the process of procuring Greece with an ever increasing debt. Most of the debt was created by Goldman Sachs via a complicated network of derivatives and fraudulent accounting methods, in an effort to get Greece approved for the Euro. Mr. Draghi was responsible for the political process inside of the EU bureaucracy. Mr. Draghi, was ""coincidently"" also a former high ranking employee at Goldman Sachs.

* Since 2007 Goldman Sachs has settled or been fined for more than $ 100 billion. The loss inflicted on their own costumers, competitors and third parties easily exceed $ 1 trillion. They have been caught stealing, cheating, defrauding and manipulating assets many many times. Goldman Sachs is literally the most criminal corporation in written history.

* If the IMF, EU, ECB and Goldman Sachs really wanted to help Greece, they would have paused the loans, then they would have helped Greece introduce all the much needed structural reforms. Instead they have forced Greece into austerity, economical decline and political instability.  

* The IMF, EU and ECB has not addressed the issue of illegitimacy. More than half of the Greek debt was created in secrecy, away from public view and systematically lied about. Past settlements of similar situations clearly indicates that the Greek people is not obliged to repay the illegitimate part of their debt.  


If Goldman Sachs ultimately succeeds in their effort to force Greece into repaying all of her debt, which is a mathematically impossibility, then corporations can and will be enforce their illegal claims upon sovereign nations; Due Process of Law becomes null and void. They have a very strong vested interest in making it as painful and difficult for Greece as possible. 

* ***1)*** The profits they can earn from bribing and manipulating sovereign governments into accepting huge debt loads will be enormous.

* ***2)*** They are willing to force sovereign nations into avoiding any talks of a debt default. Right now they are showing how far they are willing to go and how many politicians, administrators and media outlets they have on their payroll. 

***Solution:*** Do as Iceland did, jail the criminal bankers and refuse to repay their illegitimate debt.

Second gas pipeline under Baltic in the works
19.06.2015 11:12
Russian energy giant Gazprom this week signed a letter of intent with Shell, E.ON and OMV to work on the second pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany.

The pipeline will have the same capacity as the existing Nord Stream pipeline – 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year – and if built will double the quantity of gas exported to Germany from Russia.
""The construction of additional transport infrastructure along the shortest route between gas fields in northern Russia and markets in Europe will contribute to increasing the safety and reliability of deliveries for new contracts,"" said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller.
Germany is the largest buyer of Russian natural gas, with a total volume of 40 billion cubic meters in 2013. Gazprom supplies 30 percent of the EU's gas needs.
Nord Stream is an offshore natural gas pipeline from Vyborg in the Russian Federation to Greifswald in Germany. At 1,222 kilometres (759 miles) in length, it is the longest sub-sea pipeline in the world.

null,false,Lustschloss,EURO,feeding grapes to Donald Tusk,null,"&gt;In July 2012, Timothy F. Geithner, the United States Treasury secretary at the time, traveled to Sylt, an island off Germany in the North Sea.

&gt;Mr. Geithner was there for a meeting with Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister, who would spend his summers at his vacation home on the tiny island.

&gt;The topic was Greece.

&gt;In the home’s library, the two men spoke about Greece’s prospects and begun discussing ways for the European Union to keep the country in the eurozone.

&gt;To Mr. Geithner’s dismay, however, Mr. Schäuble took the conversation in a different direction.

&gt;“He told me there were many in Europe who still thought kicking the Greeks out of the eurozone was a plausible — even desirable — strategy,” Mr. Geithner later recounted in his memoir, “Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises.” “The idea was that with Greece out, Germany would be more likely to provide the financial support the eurozone needed because the German people would no longer perceive aid to Europe as a bailout for the Greeks,” he says in the memoir.

&gt;“At the same time, a Grexit would be traumatic enough that it would help scare the rest of Europe into giving up more sovereignty to a stronger banking and fiscal union,” Mr. Geithner wrote. “The argument was that letting Greece burn would make it easier to build a stronger Europe with a more credible firewall.”

It is very unlikely to happen. Under Putin, there has never been a direct Russia/Nato/EU conflict. He knows the limits to Russia's power. That is meaningless.

&gt; but stupid leaders , like Putin

Let me just stop you there. Putin is very clearly not stupid. He has successfully invaded multiple countries in the past decade or so and up until last year had little to no consequences for it. Under his leadership, the Russian economy improved dramatically, standard of living improved, the number of people living below poverty line declined from 30% in 2000 to 14% in 2008. I could go on, BRICS, international energy/arms/nuclear power deals...

&gt; hide the background of insane criminals who were empowered during the raise of securitarian thinking since the autumn of 2011.

Putin rose from the ranks of the KGB to working in various St Petersburg administrations, then appointed to head of the FSB (one  successor of KGB), then deputy PM, then president. Putin knows his home audience, that's why the obviously paranoid statements he brings out, is directed at only  Russians. He isn't insane at all.


&gt;There are seriously insane people, similar to the ISIL, quite close to the circles of power in Russia.

I disagree, they may have odd or silly views, but to label people insane or liken them to ISIL is silly.

He knows the limits, but people who have been empowered in the last 4 years do not. I'll be short, but I have seen some of those people, talked to some others and they either hail from the circles of the military specialists who like war for the sake of war or from the circles of the religious extremists who BELIEVE that Russia will win a war no matter how horrible, and who BELIEVE that Russia has a 'mission-civilisatrice' as the 'last best country on Earth' to erase the 'homosexual countries off this planet'. It may be hard to recognize or comprehend, but those people have their own manuals and their own traditions, not unlike the Taliban. Child prostitution, poligamy, ban on education for women is among those. I know that it is hard to believe, but it was also hard to believe for Europeans that Iran or Afghanistan could become what it is today.

&gt;Putin is very clearly not stupid. 

He is, unfortunately. He started believing in his own propaganda.

&gt;He has successfully invaded multiple countries in the past decade or so and up until last year had little to no consequences for it. 

Which have not been a burden on the budget due to the limited nature of the expenses and a proficient budget.


&gt;Under his leadership, the Russian economy improved dramatically, standard of living improved, the number of people living below poverty line declined from 30% in 2000 to 14% in 2008. 

That is what you see, but it's not what there is. Not under his leadership - under the leadership of the people who have been in politics and economy since the end of the Soviet Union. Putin is a thief, maybe a little talented in that domain, but that is really all he knows - everything done right in the economy was done right by the people he fired, killed or alienated during those last years. Right now he is surrounded by brainless yes-men because, yes, he did not like the advice of the intelligent people, in fact he didn't like those people at all, merely tolerated them, and yes he is stupid - all the crisis management he did show how tremendously stupid he is in the crucial questions of economy. And he's going to end up like Khaddafi, yet this possibility is unfathomable for him today.

As for ""gamblers"", maybe you're confusing this crisis with the one from 2008. We're not talking about investment banks that made high risk bets on high return assets here, but about the kind of investors that buy Eurozone government bonds. Those are the ones that do *not* want to gamble, but accept low returns in exchange for low risk, and on paper Greek government bonds seemed safe.

Why were they wrong/catastrophic? Greece's behavior was wrong/catastrophic, had they followed the treaties they signed up with, we wouldn't have these problems. Also these things *were* thought about beforehand. That's why the Eurozone treaties have a no-bailout clause.

&gt; Making the debt sustainable, reduce the austerity fatigue and extend application of the reforms over a larger period of time, take measures that do not reduce the GDB/debt ratio? Are these things too radical?

How? All of those would've required a mandate from Eurozone voters (Greece is not the only democracy), and would have gotten rejected in many/most countries. Hence they are not valid solutions. And I could argue they wouldn't even have solved anything, just enabled Greece to keep running a deeply unsustainable economy on someone else's money for a while longer.

Yes, they got a mandate from the voters back then (barely). And at that time there was all the reason to believe that it was the right choice, since as we've seen the solution has worked everywhere where it was actually followed.

Può essere sicuramente vero, ma non c'entra assolutamente nulla con quello che sto dicendo.

Per fare un esempio: Moltissimi di coloro che credono nelle pseudoscienze lo fanno per groupthink. Si può anche ipotizzare, tuttavia, che un ragazzo che di scienza sa poco condanni la pseudoscienza solo per groupthink: non vuole essere perculato dai suoi amici edgy con la fedora e non vuole sembrare un hippy. Ciò però non toglie che chi dal groupthink ci sta fuori ed è nella posizione di decidere senza essere influenzato alla fine le pseudoscienze le condanni, proprio nello stesso modo del ragazzino, ma senza condividere la sua idiozia. [Reverse stupidity is not intelligence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lw/reversed_stupidity_is_not_intelligence/).

&gt; Sul piano strettamente razionale, con quelle premesse, l'ateismo non è una conseguenza logica necessaria.

Dipende dalle regole che decidiamo di dare al discorso: se tu vuoi che uno sia positivo sulle sue scelte allora Popper ci ha da tempo impedito di agire in questi termini non in un campo, ma in tutti.

Se invece poniamo la questione in termine di teoria delle probabilità siamo in questa situazione: la probabilità di ogni proposizione ""metafisica"" in positivo (es: Dio esiste ed è onnipotente, onnisciente e buono) è inizialmente uguale e molto bassa, viste le innumerevoli varianti in contraddizione. Il noumeno Kantiano però non piace a nessuno (neanche a me), quindi i valori di probabilità che diamo a ogni proposizione varia in base a ciò che osserviamo.

Per questo è importante uscire dal groupthink: se stai dentro hai inevitabilmente tutti i valori sballati a favore di qualcosa senza un motivo razionale. Stando fuori capisci che non ha senso credere nell'esistenza di Dio piuttosto che, non saprei, nell'essere in una simulazione gestita da un'umanità post-singolarità (anzi, la probabilità che la seconda opzione sia vera è più alta, visto che le simulazioni esistono davvero, mentre la prima fa parte di un bias di personificazione conosciuto). Quindi sono a-teo.

Is it any wonder that after squandering 5 years to institute Reform they find themselves having to double down on Austerity.

That's the standard neo-liberal mantra: ""Living standards for the broader population are too high. Cuts in social spending and a reduction in workers' rights are necessary to create better conditions for business.""

There are much broader structural problems with the EU. Essentially, the EU is a malformed economic union. It's a monetary union without the corresponding fiscal union. It puts its member states in a policy straitjacket, and deals with the massive imbalances that arise out of combining strong export-oriented economies with weaker services-based economies by forcing the weaker economies to implement harsh fiscal austerity during crises. It should be obvious that a naked monetary union in which the strongest economy keeps internal demand low and racks up a massive trade surplus with the other member states is unsustainable without large fiscal transfers. The currencies of the weaker states can't devalue in order to equalize the trade imbalance, forcing extremely painful direct wage reductions on the weaker states. Imagine if the United States followed such an insane economic arrangement between the states.

That's the context for the situation not only in Greece, but in Spain, Portual and Italy as well. This is, at heart, a problem of a completely unsustainable economic arrangement within Europe, which can only be maintained by cruel austerity policies that have induced recession and a reduction of living standards across the periphery over the past 7 years.",null,0,null,1436717886,null,0,false,0,ct0r9h9,null,t3_3d0274,null,t1_ct0r9h9,null,t1_ct0kmv4,null,null,null,1440483832,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Since it is summer, I can also recommend that you look at Bungalows (huts) on camping sites or similar. Some place where you can live in only during the summer. 

During the winter the aforementioned Ferienwohnungen would be an option. Right now these are too expensive, but I know that those are often empty or available at steep discounts in the off-season. Places to look at would be the North Sea islands and along the Baltic Sea coast from late October onwards. 

EDIT: Regarding living somewhere in the summer only - consider a ""Dauercampingplatz"". This is a camping site where you can rent a place for a tent / mobile home for 6 months / up to a year. Some price quotes I have seen for this option are around 600 EUR for six months plus electricity and hot water. Most camping sites are open until late October. Camping gear would set you back around another 500-1000 EUR, depends how comfortable you want/need it to be. [This tent](https://www.globetrotter.de/shop/meru-greenfield-4-196279) would be my recommendation if you are seriously considering this.

It doesn't need to be. The ESM can be capitalized by the ECB. It can still be restricted to interest payments only, so it becomes impossible to repay debt with it, only to freeze debt and repayment will always come from the original borrower - if you're afraid of moral hazards. There's also no inflation risk, because interest never comes from real economic activity, it is created as part of the loan, so it eliminates credit with credit. Hell, it would even *reduce* inflation risk.

Verhandlungsrunde](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2162304-14-10-bmwi-bericht-7-runde-geschwarzt.html) (der natürlich nicht völlig objektiv sein sein kann), drängt sich dennoch der Eindruck auf, daß die USA mehr zum Nehmen als zum Geben geneigt sind. 

Sie verfolgen einseitig den Vorteil ihrer heimischen Industrien und wollen ihre (de-)regulatorischen Praktiken auf die EU ausgedehnt sehen. 

Außer natürlich beim ""intellektuellen Eigentum"", das gar nicht streng genug geschützt werden kann.

Interessante Details:

&gt;Der EU-Vorschlag, im SPS-Kapitel auch Bestimmungen zum Tierschutz
aufzunehmen, dürfte für die US-Seite problematisch sein.

&gt;Im Bereich Verschlüsselung möchte die US-Seite Regelungen in TTIP
aufnehmen. In den USA zertifiziert das National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) die Einhaltung von Computer Sicherheitsstandards bei Produkten, die an die US-Regierung verkauft werden. Die US-Seite betonte die besondere Bedeutung von Standards für die Verschlüsselung als Thema ggü. Drittstaaten.

&gt;Die EU verwies darauf, dass in diesem Bereich derzeit die Meinungsbildung mit
Mitgliedstaaten und Stakeholdern erfolge. Zudem wies EU-Kommission auf die
besondere Sensibilität der Verschlüsselungsthematik insbesondere bei kritischer
Infrastruktur hin.

[8. Verhandlungsrunde](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2162231-15-03-20-bmwie-bericht-8-runde-geschwarzt.html)

&gt;Im Bereich des Marktzugangs für Agrargüter liegen die Textvorschläge beider Seiten derzeit
noch weit auseinander, so dass die US-Seite bislang nicht dazu bereit ist, einen konsolidierten
Text mit der EU zu erstellen. Der EU-Vorschlag für ein Kapitel zu Wein und Spirituosen wurde
von der US-Seite erneut unter Verweis auf die ablehnende Haltung der US-Weinhersteller zurück gewiesen.

&gt;Nach einer Pause in der siebten Verhandlungsrunde wurde nunmehr ebenfalls über den Bereich der öffentlichen Auftragsvergabe verhandelt. Die USA waren allerdings nicht bereit,
substantiell über eine Marktöffnung zu verhandeln.

&gt;Diskussionen kreisten auch Bereiche in gemeinsamen Interesse wie transparente Rechtsetzung, Gesetzesfolgenabschätzung oder ex-post Evaluation von Gesetzen. Der unausgeglichene Anwendungsbereich stellt nach wie vor eine erhebliche Hürde dar. Danach möchte die USSeite lediglich Regulierungen der US-Bundesbehörden einbeziehen, verlangt aber von der EU
die Einbeziehung von Legislativakten (Verordnungen und Richtlinien), delegierten und Durchführungsrechtsakten sowie Maßnahmen der Mitgliedstaaten in nationaler Kompetenz in das
regulatorische Kapitel.


&gt;Die USA erläuterten ihren Vorschlag, ein System zurgegenseitigen Anerkennung von Normen zu schaffen, in dem US-Normen daraufhin geprüft werden sollen, ob sie – wie europäische
EN-Normen – die Vermutung der Konformität mit wesentlichen Anforderungen nach EURichtlinien erfüllen. Auch sollen nach den Vorstellungen der USA bestehende US-Normen stärkere Berücksichtigung bei der Erarbeitung von europäischen Normen finden.

&gt;Pflanzen- und tierhygienische Maßnahmen (SPS-Kapitel)

&gt;Der US-Text enthält einen Artikel zu „science and risk“, dessen Zielsetzung es ist, dass eine
wissenschaftliche Prüfung, die die Unbedenklichkeit einer Technologie oder eines Produkts
feststellt, ohne Ermessensspielräume zu einer Zulassung führen müsse. Ebenfalls vorgeschlagen sind Transparenzvorschriften sowie ein Artikel zur Zulassung von Produkten aus „moderner Agrartechnologie“. 

&gt;Beim Schutz geistigen Eigentums wurde erneut über die Liste möglicher Themen für ein Kapitel diskutiert und Fragen aus der 7. Verhandlungsrunde weiter aufgearbeitet. Auch nach mehr als eineinhalb Jahren Verhandlungen bleibt weitgehend unklar, welchen Inhalt das IPR-Kapitel haben soll. Die US-Seite möchte bislang keinen Textvorschlag austauschen, obwohl die EUKOM hierzu erneut aufforderte. 

&gt;Die US-Seite verknüpfte die Diskussionen insbesondere mit den aktuellen Diskussionen über das Lissabon-Abkommen im Rahmen der WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organisation) und brachte zum Ausdruck, auch in anderen Bereichen in Zukunft nicht mit der EU kooperieren zu wollen. Die Diskussionen zu internationalen Abkommen seien noch am weitesten fortgeschritten und könne vrs. zügig abgeschlossen werden.

Also gingen sie hin und fragten wieso, was  sie besser machen können. Deswegen gibt es sie immer noch. 

Die Universitäten haben halt so getan, wie es sie nichts anginge, statt hier organisatorisch einzugreifen. Aber auch die Wirtschaftslandschaft hat für diese Konzentration gearbeitet. Es ist halt eben schon ein Unterschied, ob eine Firma für Profit oder für Arbeit existiert.

&gt; It was the rumours of an 'island of the blind' which first bought Angelos, a journalist, to Greece in 2011. He had heard that on Zakynthos, something like two per cent of the population was registered blind.
&gt;
Only, they weren't: indeed, it would later transpire 61 of the 680 'blind' residents were quite happily driving around the island. But being 'blind' had its advantages - in particular, the €724 paid in benefits once every two months, and a reduction in their utility bills.
&gt;
Only, of course, 498 of the 680 blind residents of Zakynthos were not blind, or even partially sighted. It was a scam which could be traced back to one ophthalmologist and one official, which was estimated to have cost the country €9 million. And, as Angelos discovered, it was only the tip of the iceberg.  
&gt; ...  
&gt;When the government chose to take a closer look at who they were paying pensions to, they found a slightly suspicious 8,500 pensioners had surpassed the milestone age of 100. An even closer look revealed, 40,000 pension claims were fraudulent. It seems people were forgetting to register their loved ones' deaths.

null,false,BombastixderTeutone,null,null,null,"&gt;Kapitalismus ist ein Essentially Contested Concept[10] und wird sehr unterschiedlich wahrgenommen. Bachinger/Matis unterscheiden drei verschiedene Wahrnehmungen.

&gt;In der markteuphorischen Wahrnehmung werden Kapitalismus und Marktwirtschaft de facto gleichgesetzt. Kapitalismus wird als entbehrlicher Begriff gesehen, der aus der ""sozialistischen Mottenkiste"" komme.[11]

&gt;In der marktkritischen Wahrnehmung steht Kapitalismus für ein ausschließlich an einer kapitalistischen Rationalität orientiertes Denken, das auf Profit und die optimierte Verwertung der eingesetzten Produktionsmittel abzielt, ohne dabei Aspekte der Nachhaltigkeit, der Ethik und möglicher sozialer Verwerfungen zu berücksichtigen.[12]

&gt;In der sozialkritischen Wahrnehmung kommt der Phase des Hochkapitalismus eine besondere Bedeutung zu. Die Durchsetzung des Kapitalismus bewirkte demnach weitreichende Verschiebungen der Wirtschafts- und Gesellschaftsstruktur und einschneidende Brüche in den Lebens- und Arbeitsbedingungen. Es sei der Antagonismus zwischen Kapitaleignern und Kapitallosen (Proletariern) entstanden. Das „industrielle Proletariat“ hätte den Unternehmen als reichliche Reservearmee zur Verfügung gestanden und sei dadurch gezwungen gewesen, niedrige Löhne und materielle Unsicherheit in Kauf zu nehmen. Bei den meisten Industriearbeitern lagen die Löhne damals knapp am Existenzminimum. Frauen und Kinder mussten daher ebenfalls arbeiten gehen, um den Lebensunterhalt der Familie zu sichern. Arbeitszeiten von 16 Stunden pro Tag waren keine Seltenheit. Das rasante Wachstum der städtischen Ballungsräume führte zu einer dramatisch niedrigen Lebenserwartung. Die Polarisierung der Gesellschaft durch die Entstehung der „sozialen Frage“ als Folge des ungehemmten „Manchesterkapitalismus“ ist der soziale und wirtschaftliche Hintergrund der wirkungsmächtigen Kapitalismusanalyse von Karl Marx.[13]

null,false,yayachiken,NRW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,null,"I usually watch US shows in English, because my English is good enough, but when I watch with my girlfriend, we have to fall back to dubs or at least a version with German subtitles. She knows English well, but it doesn't work if she has to concentrate for a couple hours, and the actors don't speak exceptionally clearly.

I dislike most dubs, but I also sometimes stop to appreciate a good dub when I come across a good one.

For example I really like the dubbed versions of Austin Powers (""Mir ist übrigens klar, dass ich eine große Warze im Gesicht hab. Da bietet sich ein Wortspiel an wegen meines Auftrags als Wanze."") or ""Das Leben des Brian""/""The Life of Brian"" (""Oh ja, chleudert den Purchen zu Poden""), both due to the special care that was taken to ensure that as many jokes are taken over or reinvented as possible.

I also like the dub of ""Sherlock"" (the one with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman) because it works alright, and all the CGI HUD stuff was redone in German. Generally, most shows and movies are lazy about the stuff shown.

Some dubs even have a larger cultural influence. For example, Alf had lots of jokes redone, and his catchphrase ""Null problemo"" (that was invented for the German dub) even caught on as real life colloquial speech. (Though I am not old enough to clearly remember the quality. From the same standpoint I guess the dub of ""Married With Children"" aka ""Eine schrecklich nette Familie"" was also done well?).

In old dubs, the ZDF dubbing studio has a bit of a reputation for creative dubbing. For example, the series ""Die Zwei"" (original: The Persuaders) is quite famous. It flopped in the original but the dub was incredibly well received because the dialogue was in parts rewritten and so many laid-back puns or jokes were introduced.

Another example (by the same translation author) would be ""Ein Käfig voller Helden"" (Hogan's Heroes) which was also a success only after this writer took liberties with the script.

Another honorable mention for good translation (though not a dub) works would be for the Donald Duck comics by Dr. Erika Fuchs who also coined a very particular style and shaped the German language (for example by popularizing inflections in comics, stuff like *stöhn*, *gähn*, *zitter*, i.e. only using the word stem to illustrate an action by this ""faux-onomatopoeia"")

You can usually see when it's going to be a bad sub because the writers are too afraid to take liberties and only translate word for word when it gets hard. For example when Sheldon is threatened by his girlfriend that all funds would go to the philosophy department if he didn't attend a fundraiser, he exclaimed ""Oh diese Geisteswissenschaften! *laugh track*"" I actually giggled because I immediately knew that he would have said ""Oh the humanities!"" in the original, and my friend immediately asked me what the joke was he didn't get... The joke doesn't translate, that is clear, but still, maybe they could have thrown in another one, even if it is lame (you can usually still find something like ""Not these burger flippers!"" or whatever...)",null,0,null,1436719383,null,0,1436720715,0,ct0s0e6,null,t3_3czljq,null,t1_ct0s0e6,null,t3_3czljq,null,null,null,1437796056,null,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3,null

&gt; This type of nonsense is exactly why so many EU countries don't trust Greece. 

Greece is literally the definition of debt colony. Unsustainable debt is used as leverage to impose economic policies that lead to the collapse of society and economy.

&gt; First they whine about how mean the creditors were to buy Greek bonds in the first place, and how it's unfair to expect Greece to pay them back, and how the creditors are at fault.

Noone is whining. Your attempt to equate sensible economical arguments with whining is ridiculous. 

Debt does not equal money. It's an investment. Private financial institutions were going crazy the previous decade. They should have losses because of bad investments. Simple. Instead EU leaders *chose* that those inevitable losses would be imposed on their taxpayers on a future date. Creditors don't have a higher moral ground than debtors. Different side of the same coin. 

Creditors *are* at fault for the situation the last 5 years. Their unwillingness to adhere to basic economics that say that a debt relief had to be done is astonishing. And of course the too late, too-little, butchered haircut of 2012 was a failure. The imposed dubbed expansionary austerity was a failure. The internal devaluation was a failure. The calculations of multipliers and the forecasts were a failure. The economic program was a failure. But they insist on it.

&gt; But then they go on and demand that the EU lend even more money ($50 B) to Greece. 

Noone is demanding anything more than a sensible solution. You continue to equate debate to BILD-level pseudo-arguments. EU seems to live in a surreal world where economics don't matter. Austerity simply makes it harder to pay the debts. *That's a fact*. They are demanding ...4% surplus, which is unheard of, not only in depressed economies but even in the biggest booms in the history. Voodoo economics that Keynes disproved a hundred years are now considered the norm. Europe is a crazy, crazy place.

&gt; You can't have it both ways. Complaining about how being expected to pay back money is debt colonization and demanding that more money be lent.

Every sentence you write is at attempt to ridicule a debate to lowest denominator arguments. The exact situation of borrowing money that are getting added to an unsustainable debt is insane. It is obvious Greece needs a debt relief. The situation is so fucked up that even ...Schauble admitted debt unsustainable BUT it can't be done according to ...you know ...rules.",null,1,null,1436719533,null,0,false,0,ct0s32e,null,t3_3d0201,null,t1_ct0s32e,null,t1_ct0quiz,null,null,null,1437796108,null,-6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-6,null

null,false,MrStevens1,EURO,European Union,null,"Well.. there's some truth in that. The image portrayed by UKIP however is false, as usual. 

The issue of who can sign treaties and has competence to sign treaties is divided between member states and the EU level. You can find in the treaties specific competences assigned to the EU, competences that member states no longer are able to do at the national level. I'm thinking specifically of free trade treaties, as this is a common market competence assigned to the EU, and taken away from the member States. In this regard, UK will not be allowed to sign a free trade treaty with China. 

On a personal note: There is no reason why an individual member State will wish to sign a free trade treaty individually. The leverage and power projection each state gets from being part of the EU is far superior from what it is able to project on it's own. Even though the power projection and representation of national interests is diffused by multiple parties trying to participate, some with more accentuated interests and more influence, it's unquestionable that small states, and big states themselves, benefit far more from EU coordination, as opposed to going at it alone, as might be suggested that EU doesn't allow for states to sign treaties individually. 

If anything to be taken from the Greek negotiations, that is the lack of leverage that an individual small-medium state has in relation to big players on the world market, and the ability for a state to adequately represent its interests is directly correlated to its size and assets. In that regard, action on the EU level is the only means of keeping europe relevant.

However, this is a cooperation agreement. This is something that member states are still very much free to set their own policies on, and sign international agreements with other EU, and non-EU states on.

If Merkel felt like a deal was the best way than that is where we are heading. I personally liked what she was shown to say in the news: ""The advantages have to outweigh the disadvantages both for greece and the rest of the EZ"". Merkel is not someone that is openly being in a fierce stance, the german government in general is not and if they would decide to go into new negotiations they would also get a majority in the parliament for that. 

Merkel only very gradually backed away from a deal being the only solution to a more open stance by now. This is also not really about inner politics so much. The oppinion of the german population is fairly clear (and propagated by disgusting papers such as the bild). The major issue for me and I think also for our politicians is that their is simply no trust left that the greeks can effectively reform.

Je répète, dire que jamais peuple n'a jamais été aussi humilié que le peuple grec ou qu'il s'agit d'une guerre (tu sais, un conflit violent entre deux populations opposées, avec des morts en masse), est très excessif et est basé sur l'émotion. On ne peut pas discuter comme ça, je sens que sinon on va atteindre le point Godwin vite fait.

&gt;L'avantage de l'Euro pour l'Allemagne c'est quand même de lier ses premiers partenaires économiques à la monnaie, afin qu'ils ne puissent pas dévaluer. La seule solution est alors la désinflation compétitive, typiquement ce qu'a fait l'Allemagne depuis Schroeder, mais il faut être le premier à la faire pour tuer des voisins économiques. L'Allemagne applique une technique de passager clandestin (si tout le monde fait comme elle, le sytème n'est pas viable).

Cette analyse est sans doute largement vraie, mais beaucoup la qualifieraient de simpliste et biaisée.
L'Allemagne défend ses intérêts, tout comme la France, la Grèce, ou n'importe quel pays. Elle va sans doute trop loin dans son sens mais les autres pays peuvent difficilement se plaindre quand c'est elle qui tire en avant l'économie Européenne tandis que les autres pays stagnent ou dans le cas de la Grèce vivent à crédit sans faire aucun effort pendant des décennies avant de se réveiller subitement quand elle se retrouve au pied du mur. Et oui, Syriza est sans doute le gouvernement le plus intègre qu'ils n'ont jamais eu mais pendant très longtemps la Grèce a été dirigée par des incapables corrompus faisant leur petit pain à coup de clientélisme et les arguments de Syriza vont avoir du mal à compenser le gros problème de crédibilité de la Grèce.

De plus il est difficile de construire une union aussi massive et regroupant plusieurs pays différent que l'Union Européenne et l'Eurozone et il n'y a pas de solution évidente sur la façon de le faire. Il est facile de critiquer mais moins facile de proposer, et il est plus facile de se rebeller quand on a plus rien à perdre, comme c'est le cas de la Grèce.

La situation est compliquée et c'est pas avec des ""y'a qu'à faut qu'on"" qu'on va s'en sortir.

&gt;Ce qui se passe est gravissime, ce n'est pas en minimisant les choses qu'on s'en sortira

Donc il vaut mieux dire n'importe quoi ? Traitons Merkel de nazi ou Tsipras de bolchevique pendant qu'on y est, au moins on fera bouger les choses... vers la division et la haine.

&gt;cette Europe-là, ce n'est pas celle que nous voulions.

**Montag und Dienstag** waren eigentlich recht normale Unitage. Früh aufstehen (heißt bei mir 8 Uhr, anstatt von den normalen 10 Uhr), in die Bib gehen und lernen für die Klausuren, die ich diese Woche schreiben sollte.

Am **Mittwoch** war dann die erste von den zwei angesagt, und sie lief ganz gut eigentlich. Ich kann zwar schwer einschätzen, was für ne Note ich haben werde, aber bestanden hab ich das Ding auf jeden Fall. Am Abend dann mit zwei Kumpels in einer Bar abgeschossen, bis die uns um 2 Uhr rausgeschmissen haben.

Den **Donnerstag** morgen habe ich dementsprechend gehasst... Ekliger Kater D: Das hat mich aber dann nicht davon abgehalten, am Abend dann noch auf ne Party zu gehen, nur eben dieses Mal ohne Alkohol. Man kann ja auch ohne Alkohol seinen Spaß haben... Welp, ok, so ganz ohne war dann auch nicht, aber bis auf zwei Wodkashots habe ich wirklich nur Mate getrunken.

Am **Freitag** musste ich mal wieder trainieren gehen, nachdem ich das ne Woche lang echt vernachlässigt hatte, und am Abend hatte ich dann den letzten Abschnitt eines Blockseminars.

Der **Samstag** morgen hat dann auch recht chillig angefangen: Klausur geschrieben (Die war viiiiieeeellll zu einfach, wenn ich da keine 1-Komma habe, dann weiß ich auch nicht) und dann Sachen gepackt, weil es nach Hause gehen sollte, denn schließlich wartet mein neues [MIDI Keyboard/ Controller](http://i.imgur.com/IBF9ULI.jpg) sehnsüchtig auf mich; vorher aber noch schnell Soyasoße für Mutti gekauft.  
Während der Fahrt schien mir eigentlich alles ganz normal, beim Ausladen der ganzen Sachen stellte sich aber dann heraus, dass die Soyasoßenflasche nen Sprung oder nen Riss hatte, wodurch die dann anscheinend während der Fahrt aufgesprungen ist und die ganze Soße in meinem Kofferraum verteilt wurde... Und weil das noch nicht genug war, bin ich anscheinend auf dem Heimweg über nen Glassplitter gefahren, weshalb mein einer Vorderreifen langsam an Luft verloren hatte... Aber wenigstens hatte ich mein Launckey, mit dem ich mich ablenken konnte, so there's that.

**Heute** dann Reifen gewechselt und Ersatzreifen draufgemacht, damit ich oder mein Vater in die Werkstatt fahren kann...

Not what I said.

&gt;No newspapers, no books, no TV news segments?

Are you really comparing newspapers and news segments to a memoir?

Put it like this, if you cite a newspaper with the same editorial and fact checking review as Geithner's book does, then you should get new sources.  

&gt;There is nothing to suggest that Geithner is lying or has an anti-Schäuble agenda.

There is a difference between saying ""he is lying"" and saying ""this isn't solid enough evidence to believe the claim to be true.""

See that?  I recommend a *third* option of not make a judgement one way or the other without more evidence.

&gt;Have you turned on the news recently???

Sure.  The fact that you quoted unconfirmed stories in a memoir from 2012 suggests that the news recently didn't offer much proof of your cliams.

&gt;Yes, their names are Wolfgang Schäuble, Josef Ackermann and their merry band of ordoliberals.

Maybe you are the one biased here if you can't see basic facts because someone you don't like is telling them. About Latvia/Baltics it depends on your definition of success. They actually endured *unnecessary* pain since they had the option to devalue. Instead they *chose* austerity. Even like that, in Greece it has been harsher. Read [here](http://coppolacomment.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/how-do-you-say-dead-cat-in-latvian.html) about the ""success"". I guess after all numbers are more important than humans. 

&gt; And have a look here[1] - does this look like wage depression? Germany is slightly below the Scandinavian countries and Benelux only - absolutely appropriate. No wage depression at all, if anything, slightly too high.

You are linking to absolute numbers that bear no context. I literally linked the Krugman post for the wage depression. Read it. It's not about Krugman, it is obvious to literally everyone that German depressed wages, it is not even a point of contention among scholars.

&gt; There is no beggar-thy-neighbour strategy, especially not if you look at Germany's export markets[2] .

What Germany did is the definition of beggar-thy-neighbour. Again, I am not sure if this is even a point of contention among economists. Germany became an export-heavy economy precisely after the introduction of the euro, taking advantage of the EMU members by keeping wages frozen and violating the 2% ECB inflation rate. [Official OECD data on German account balance.](https://data.oecd.org/chart/4khc) Which by the way is repeatedly violating the 6% surplus **rule**, since Schauble likes rules so much. Large surpluses are as much a problem as deficits.


You are linking a 2014 report which bears to relevance or context. I would say [this](https://kkalev4economy.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/germany-foreign-trade.jpg) or [this](https://www.stratfor.com/sites/default/files/styles/stratfor_large__s_/public/styles/stratfor_full/public/main/images/germany_eu_world_trade_balance.png?itok=gaDUlLzd) is more representative and very telling of the tendencies. German simply beggar-thy-neighbour until 2009.

You mean when Greece was bailed out? I'm starting to think you don't actually know what a bailout is or how it works and are just repeating a talking point that you heard without understanding what it means.

&gt;But now suddenly everybody is suspicious of the plans of a small economic nation because they aren't completely volunteering their sovereignty.

It isn't that suddenly.  The elected greek government has been shitting on every ounce of trust that was left towards them from Europe.  That was *after* getting elected based on a campaign of ripping up old promises.

Did you miss all of that or are you just choosing to ignore it?

&gt;Greece hasn't missed an EFSF repayment yet, so suffice to say, up until this point in time, the EFSF is in the black not the red.

You understand that missing *other* payments can still reduce trust that you will make your future payments on other lines of credit, right?

I mean, if you miss your car payment, your bank might not extend you a second mortgage even though are current with your balance with them.

&gt;And before somebody mentions the haircut that occurred, understand that that was private debt, not public that was restructured.

What?  You mean public debt that was owned by the private sector.  That is totally different than how you just portrayed it.",null,1,null,1436721113,null,0,false,0,ct0svuf,null,t3_3d0ekv,null,t1_ct0svuf,null,t1_ct0qkx0,null,null,null,1437796804,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Leave out the 0 infront of the 800.

The leading zero which belongs to area codes or service codes always has to be left out if you dial through the country code. It is a remainder from past times, when the phone network was getting automated. If you start dialing with anything but a zero the network assumes you want to call someone inside your local area (or in your particular mobile provider's network). 

If you start dialing with a single 0 the network thinks you want to call someone inside your country but outside of your local area. So it will try to make out which area code is following the 0. And once it recognizes an area code it will then attempt to call the phone with the remaining digits.

If you start dialing with a double zero or a + the network thinks you want to call someone outside your country. It will look at the first 2 or 3 digits to find out which country you want to call. Naturally if you dial numbers like this the leading 0 of the area code is not required, because it is already established, that you are not trying to call someone in your local area. Back in the day, when you still hat to turn the dial wheel and wait for it to crawl back nobody would have tried to call a local number going all the way through country and area codes.

&gt;A debt moratorium is a delay in the payment of debts or obligations. The term is generally used to refer to acts by national governments.

Over several months the Germany-based non-profit investigative newsroom CORRECT!V has gathered facts, investigated in eastern Ukraine and Russia, and found witnesses to the missile launch. The investigation unveiled a clear chain of evidence. MH17 was downed by a ground-launched BUK missile – launched by a unit of the 53rd Russian Air Defense Brigade from Kursk.

null,false,RomeVacationTips,null,null,null,"For parking in the streets of Rome the parking code is indicated by painted lines: white/no painted lines - free parking; blue - pay and display; yellow - disabled.

Do not park in a disabled spot. It's one of the few things that Roman parking maniacs respect, and the general belief is that you *will* get a ticket even if other laws are not enforced.

If you use pay and display you will have to pump a ridiculous number of coins into a machine to get your little ticket, and return to do this every morning. There's a minor possibility that you won't get a parking ticket if you don't do this (in our street the parking wardens only pass by about once every two weeks) but I really wouldn't risk it.

There are, however, places near-ish to Trastevere (10-20 minutes' walk away) with free parking. One example is [this little piazza here](https://goo.gl/maps/KO3zb) - have a look on street view. Of course the issue is then that white parking spaces are seriously oversubscribed. If you're prepared to drive around for a long time you will usually find something - generally you need to keep an eye out for someone who's just about to pull out. If you arrive in August when all the Romans are on vacation it will be a lot easier to find a space.

Finally be aware of the ZTL in Trastevere. This is a zone around the district into which you cannot drive without being given a monster fine. This is controlled by cameras with a lit sign next to them that say [VARCO ATTIVO](http://ilquotidianoinclasse.corriere.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/30e62fddc14c05988b44e7c02788e187.jpg) and they take a picture of your license plate. There's no escape from this phenomenon!

Alternatively for peace of mind if you arrive in July when the locals are still around, my recommendation would be to book a long-term parking spot at Fiumicino airport.

An Unification is a redefinition of relations between two sovereign states, one becoming part of the other. In this case, as prior to that in the Germany cases, one of the states was an EU member and the other wasn't. That brings to question the discretion that a member state has to unify when being an EU state. Does it really need approval from other states, or can it act unilaterally? It is nonetheless a constitutional issue that each member State may or may not have discretion in addressing according to their own internal policies.

In the case of Germany it did not state that approval from other states is necessary, or not. Although, the fact that approval was sought out does indicate that each member State does not have unilateral power and discretion to unify with other state, and if not approval, then support from other EU states is somewhat necessary.

&gt;I am simply saying that the analogy to debt forgiveness after WW2 is not a good one. Germany was occupied, and their policy was being implemented by the creditor nations. So....does Greece want that? I don't recommend that, but there will be concessions for more money.

It would put the responsibility of what goes wrong outright with the Trojka - although the current straitjacket is so pervasive they already have it, IMO.

Sowas höre ich zum ersten Mal. An keiner mir bekannten Universität gibt es Richtlinien wo zu publizieren sei, das regelt der einzelne Forscher selbst. Normalerweise nimmt man das beste Journal bei dem man sich Chancen auf Annahme des Papers ausrechnet. 

&gt; Die Universitäten haben halt so getan, wie es sie nichts anginge, statt hier organisatorisch einzugreifen.

Wie stellst Du Dir das vor? Wenn Elsevier jetzt North-Holland aufkauft, soll man den neuen Verlag jetzt boykottieren? 

&gt; Aber auch die Wirtschaftslandschaft hat für diese Konzentration gearbeitet.

Hast Du seriöse Quellen die das belegen? Höre ich zum ersten Mal und deckt sich nicht unbedingt mit meiner Wahrnehmung.

&gt; Die Sammlung zielt auf die Bereitstellung der Publikationen. Die grundsätzlichen Beziehungen zu den grossen Verlagen sind manchmal auch schon ein Problem wo man nicht einfach so raus kann. Es gibt sie aber immer noch, die kleinen. Noch ist nicht alles verloren. :)

Sowas ist in letzter Zeit sehr teuer geworden und große Publisher haben natürlich eine Menge Verhandlungsmacht da sie oft die ganz wichtigen Zeitschriften haben ohne die es nunmal nicht geht.

No, their GDP only collapsed when the austerity measures were in force.

Because a proper package including debt relief secures a permanent path forward for Greece instead of constantly extending the problem forward by a few months every time which is what has been going on for 5 years now.  Greece showed growth before the negotiations collapsed with both increased tax collection as well as reduced spending.   

&gt;You mean when Greece was bailed out? I'm starting to think you don't actually know what a bailout is or how it works and are just repeating a talking point that you heard without understanding what it means.

[Oh dear](http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/apr2009/gb20090410_254738.htm)

&gt;It isn't that suddenly. The elected greek government has been shitting on every ounce of trust that was left towards them from Europe. That was after getting elected based on a campaign of ripping up old promises.
Did you miss all of that or are you just choosing to ignore it?

If by trust you mean being forced into 5 years of austerity that further added to its debt load, saw its GDP sliced by 25%, and saw youth unemployment grow to over 50% then fine.  I did not miss any of it and neither did the world's leading economists.  Perhaps you are the one choosing to ignore these numbers. 

&gt;You understand that missing other payments can still reduce trust that you will make your future payments on other lines of credit, right?

They have delayed one payment to the IMF in lieu of the current negotiations.  It would be reckless of them to pay such a large amount if they are going to be forced out anyways.  Once negotiations are completed, and they are still in the EZ, then they will pay.  

&gt;What? You mean public debt that was owned by the private sector. That is totally different than how you just portrayed it.

Yes.  Instead of public debt owned by another public who wasn't even asked for approval.   ",null,0,null,1436722074,null,0,false,0,ct0te0a,null,t3_3d0ekv,null,t1_ct0te0a,null,t1_ct0svuf,null,null,null,1437797240,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

That's not the point: the point is that the ECB is Greece's central bank, and in any country the central bank would have provided emergeny liquidity in times of crisis. The ECB basically said ""go fuck yourself"" when Greece came asking for help in their hour of need still. That is grave negligence.

&gt;hat is neither under Greek ownership or control and it's most definitely not for government budget deficit fixing or debt repaying.

In extreme cases, countries can and do use their central bank. And the market run under that assumption. So when it became clear the ECB would not, the interest rates on bonds in the whole eurozone shot up and then the ECB was forced to intervene on the secondary market and the eurozone was forced to create the EFSF and ESM, or otherwise the whole euro would have blown up. A central bank being able to threaten with devaluation is a *necessity* to deal with the capital markets.

&gt;That's exactly the deal all EZ countries wanted, agreed, believe and still stick to.

Nonsense. The ESM fundamentally changed the eurozone policy, and if it existed before 2005 then Greece, nor the other SPIIG countries would have been in that much trouble.

&gt;Clearly EZ is the cause of all the problems and Greece will immediately flourish once it leaves the house and lives on it's own means. 

Straw man.

&gt;As a Croatian, with similarly incompetent indebted irresponsible government, paying double the interests on loans that Greece currently does, I can't wait for Greece to ""Oxi"" out and spectacularly display a life lesson to the rest of us. Just a tip, we are not in EZ, and 

Croatia's problem is being a very recent state coming out of a very recent civil war - comparing it with Greece in 1980 would be more fair. 

&gt;having our own Central bank or deflating our own currency does not solve anything really.

The leadership of Greece have acted in a manner that does not deserve continued bailouts, handouts, and aid.  Austerity sucks but the current meltdown is worse.  And the current meltdown is 100% the product of hardball negotiation by Syriza.

One could argue that you shouldn't hold a whole nation responsible for the terrible mismanagement of their leadership.  But it is comments like these:

&gt; As for those accusations they are very sound if you ask me or any greek really

That indicate the Greek people are complicit in this.  As you say, they largely agree with demonization of the EU partners that they are asking for money from.

Justement il est là le truc. Je profite d'une bonne capacité de concentration temporaire. Je le fait parce que j'ai envie de le faire, ce qui n'est pas le cas de 90% de ce que je fais.

Pour Chis-chan, de ce que j'en vois, rapidement, j'en suis plus proche que je l'avoue habituellement. Heureusement pour moi, j'arrive à avoir l'air acceptablement normal le reste du temps, au prix de gros efforts de ma part. Efforts que je fait surtout IRL, pour des raisons évidentes.

EDIT : Après une recherche plus approfondie sur CWCwiki. Je vais arrêter d'être évasif : je pense être un aspie.

Je fais des tractations administratives pour un diagnostique.

En jetant un œil plus en détail à mon profil on vois que ça colle pas mal : 

 * Je vous emmerde souvent avec le MBTI et les poneys. Deux centres d'intérêts précis. Hormis Reddit, ma vie me semble assez grise en comparaison. Hormis de très rare exception ça constitue la totalité de mes centres d’intérêts. Ça pèse pas lourd. Le terme adapté est ""intérêts spécifiques"" : précis et peu nombreux. On note aussi une intensité inhabituelle.

 * Mes problèmes de communication font pas grand secret ici. Je suis moi même conscient de pas être le meilleur orateur qui soit. (Un euphémisme qui m’épargne d'avoir à utiliser les mots justes.) Non sequiturs, vocabulaire inadapté, choix de mots douteux, attachement non pertinent au sens littéral d'une expression. La liste est longue. Et c'est sans parler des codes non verbaux. Sans se faire plus chier que ça c'est exactement le genre de manquements associés au troubles autistiques.

/!\ TVTropes /!\

 * Personne ne peux se rendre compte de mes problèmes d'attention, par écran interposé : c'est la raison pour laquelle je répond par points précis au longs posts et que mes réponses un peu longue se pètent la gueule façon [métaphore oubliée](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten). J'oublie vraiment ce que je racontais le temps de l'écrire. Depuis deux jours, je suis en hyper-focus. C'est l'extrême inverse : une attention concentrée pendant plusieurs heures d'affilée, sans presque aucun effort de ma part.

 Ça serait complètement pété si je pouvais faire ça à volonté, mais non. Ma capacité d'attention est complètement aléatoire.

Pour finir, je sais compenser et gommer tout ça. Ça me demande juste des efforts intellectuels gigantesques. Je suis très fatigable et relativement instable émotionnellement à cause de ça.

Même si j'apprécie beaucoup de discuter et échanger, je peux rarement le faire plus de trois ou quatre heures d'affilée sans commencer à fatiguer, et devoir me reposer seul.

J'ai des routines de compensation très très efficaces sur Reddit, comme les réponses points par points. Léconomie me permet de rester beaucoup plus longtemps. J'ai aussi pris des décisions qui me permettent d’économiser encore plus d'énergie, à vos dépends, parfois. (Refus de fournir des preuve, arguments massue, réponses à faible effort, entres autres) Je peut rester presque indéfiniment de cette façon. Même en état de fatigue avancé, je reste suffisamment compréhensible et lucide, ce qui est une grande victoire pour moi.

/!\ TVTropes /!\

Pour finir, gardez en tête une chose : Je ne lâcherai pas ces effort pour correspondre à qui je suis. Je n'en suis plus capable, après des années à tenter de ""rentrer dans le moule"", surtout que les rares fois où qui que ce soit en a un aperçu, [ça se passe pas très bien](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew).

null,false,watabadidea,null,null,null,"&gt;Because a proper package including debt relief secures a permanent path forward for Greece instead of constantly extending the problem forward by a few months every time which is what has been going on for 5 years now.

So show me what that looks like. 

Does it include any long term structural changes and reforms in Greece?

If you say no, then you've got to be kidding me.

If you say yes, then tell me why you trust that the Greeks are going to follow through.  The just elected a government that campigned on a promise of rolling structural reforms back and then burnt their economy to the ground over the past 5 months doing everything they could to resist major structural reforms.

That seems like a pretty good recipe for long term failure to me.

&gt;Greece showed growth before the negotiations collapsed with both increased tax collection as well as reduced spending.

...until the current government decide to fuck it all up to score political points.

If the Greeks will destroy the first growth they've seen in half a decade to score political points, what could possibly make you think that money alone is going to actually fix this problem?

&gt;Oh dear

Greece isn't mentioned in that article at all.

Additionally, it was written in 2009 and you were talking about a bank bailout in 2010.

Unless the guy that wrote that article was from the future, it seems like you guys aren't talking about the same thing.

""Oh dear"", indeed...

&gt;If by trust you mean being forced into 5 years of austerity that further added to its debt load, saw its GDP sliced by 25%, and saw youth unemployment grow to over 50% then fine. 

They weren't forced into shit.  They agreed to it freely because the alternative was viewed as worse.

Spin it some more though.  It just lets everyone know that you are full of shit.

&gt;I did not miss any of it and neither did the world's leading economists. Perhaps you are the one choosing to ignore these numbers.

The previous Greek spending was unsustainable, period.  Nobody really argues with this.  Even without a single piece of austerity being asked of them by outside sources, their economy *still* would have contracted and unemployment *still* would have increased. 

Implying that it is all because of ""forced"" austerity is just inaccurate.

&gt;They have delayed one payment to the IMF in lieu of the current negotiations.

You mean ""missed"".  

Seriously, you've got to just be trolling now.  When you have an agreed deadline and you don't pay without getting permission or setting up a new payment plan, that isn't a delay, that is a missed payment.

&gt;It would be reckless of them to pay such a large amount if they are going to be forced out anyways. 

So it would be reckless of them to pay back their bailout loans on time?

Seriously, how the hell do you type this and still think that the solution is to give them more money?  Are you insane?

&gt;Yes.

I applied the same logic to you.

Support that.

Do you know Geithner or his writing style or his motivations for this passage?  I mean, if he *meant* to imply that Schauble thought this way, why leave it up to interpretation?

Why not just state it explicitly?  Why rely on readers years latter to try to interpret it this way instead of just saying it directly?

It seems that if it was his intention all along for us to reach this conclusion, he sure did a shit job of conveying it.

Edit:  Additionally, when you said that there were those that felt that this was the right path, *you* sure as fuck didn't qualify it by saying that *you* didn't believe it.

You're right. I should've written ""structural primary balance"", so the pre-debt serving, seasonally and cyclically adjusted balance. For that, Feb'15 estimates where around [6% ](http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1580-should-other-eurozone-programme-countries-worry-about-a-reduced-greek-primary-surplus-target). The 4% are wrong. That was the primary surplus target. Too many pages open at once.

&gt;As for ""gamblers"", maybe you're confusing this crisis with the one from 2008

That's purely my opinion. Post-2010 bailout, if you kept riding that sweet [10% ](http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1580-should-other-eurozone-programme-countries-worry-about-a-reduced-greek-primary-surplus-target/) interest rate, you were gambling imo.

The actual price + VAT.

&gt;It is also a fact that bigger countries because they are bigger can produce larger quantities, and thus also less expensive, because price is set by the amount of production. That means that a German product for example of a given quality will be less expensive than an Italian or Greek product of the same quality.

You are forgetting that wages are higher over here which negates the economics of scale. Also: Germany companies are famous for offshoring parts of their production, so e.g. Romania makes good money assembling products for German companies.

&gt;larger countries like Germany have an advantage in the market over smaller ones, because they are able to produce and price their products at lower costs, which makes them more competitive.

Then, why is the Netherlands so very competitive?

&gt;German supermarkets like Lidl showed up everywhere, and German products started being available at the other countries everywhere

Lidl in Greece also sells local products. Also: Lidl pays VAT - your local mom and pop store maybe not.

&gt;which results to price inflation of local produced goods in the countries that adopt austerity, which makes them practically not affordable, while the German produced products are getting cheaper than ever

After all of this was done. He finally had enough money to buy a small plot of land near a lake. He (and a few contractors) remodeled the building, he worked himself, long hard hours, painting the walls, creating a menu, designing the kitchen, doing all the legal work required to open a restaurant. When it was done, the entire thing was his, bought and paid for by him and no one else.

The numbers speak for themselves, and make it clear that austerity is destroying Greece's economy.

There is a fundamental misunderstanding here. Austerity is the simple result of the fact that the Greek economy does not produce enough income to pay the level of entitlements promised by politicians. It is an effect, not the cause of the problems.

If you look at those GDP numbers, you'll notice the before the crisis the Greek GDP grew at an increased rate. If you then look at the Greek debt, you'll see that the increased GDP growth was driven by increased debt intake. This is a bubble, not normal growth. Now if you look at the Greek GDP graph before the bubble and extrapolate forwards with the pre-bubble growth rate, you'll notice that after the 25% GDP loss the GDP is now at the level it would have been with the sustainable pre-bubble growth rate.

We have good journalism here in the UK.  They each have an angle - ie support certain left or right wing ideology and this gives me a balanced view.

null,false,the_straylight_run,null,null,null,"It's a good article, but I think a few issues need clarification. 

Initially, I don't think he differentiates well enough between 'printing' money and 'creating' money. Sometimes people use these interchangeably, but shouldn't. They are different things.

Printing money means printing actual banknotes and coins.

Creating money means increasing the number in a ledger balance by some amount. 

NCBs can in fact create money. They do it all the time. They do it when the create reserves and when they extend ELA. All that happens is that they just type in some number into the account ledger of the institution in question. That number is NOT money--it's the total limit of liability that the NCB will accept on behalf of that account holder. 

It is a promise to transfer digitally, or pay in note/coin, to another institution, up to the amount reflected in the ledger.

Printing money on the other hand, is just the form that created money takes in certain circumstances. Central banks can choose to print money in ELA situations and then sell it to the commercial banks, who then pay for it with the amounts in their accounts, which the NCB put there. So, in other words, first they get a credit, then they use the credit to buy paper money. 

Why this is important is that the NCBs *don't* go the ECB for money when the extend ELA, and the ECB is never in any danger of defaulting should ELA not be repaid. 

In fact, there is no danger of anybody defaulting if ELA is not paid back. The money (reserves) aren't transferred from one account to another, meaning one account takes the loss. Instead if a commerical bank didn't pay back ELA the NCB would simply create new money to pay back any liabilities claimed against it by other institutions through target2.

The 12 reforms to be legislated by July 15 (Wednesday) are the following:

Streamlining of the VAT system and the broadening of the tax base to increase revenue;

Upfront measures to improve long-term sustainability of the pension system as part of a comprehensive pension reform programme;

The adoption of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is a major overhaul of procedures and arrangements for the civil justice system and can significantly accelerate the judicial process and reduce costs;

The safeguarding of the full legal independence of ELSTAT;

Full implementation of the relevant provisions of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, in particular by making the Fiscal Council operational before finalizing the MoU and introducing quasi-automatic spending cuts in case of deviations from ambitious primary surplus targets after seeking advice from the Fiscal Council and subject to prior approval of the institutions;

The transposition of the BRRD at the latest within a week with support from the European Commission.

Carry out ambitious pension reforms and specify policies to fully compensate for the fiscal impact of the Constitutional Court ruling on the 2012 pension reform and to implement the zero deficit clause or mutually agreeable alternative measures by October 2015;

Adopt more ambitious product market reforms with a clear timetable for implementation of all OECD toolkit I recommendations, including Sunday trade, sales periods, pharmacy ownership, milk, bakeries, [over-thecounter pharmaceutical products in a next step], as well as for the opening of macro-critical closed professions (e.g. ferry transportation). On the follow-up of the OECD toolkit-II, manufacturing needs to be included in the prior action;

On energy markets, proceed with the privatisation of the electricity transmission network operator (ADMIE)[, unless replacement measures can be found that have equivalent effect on competition, as agreed by the institutions];

On labour markets, undertake rigorous reviews of collective bargaining, industrial action and collective dismissals in line with the timetable and the approach agreed with the institutions. [In addition, the Greek authorities shall modernize the legislative framework for collective dismissals, in line with best practice]. On the basis of these reviews, labour market policies should be aligned with international and European best practices, and should not involve a return to past policy settings which are not compatible with the goals of promoting sustainable and inclusive growth;

Adopt the necessary steps to strengthen the financial sector, including decisive action on non-performing loans and measures to strengthen governance of the HFSF and the banks, in particular by eliminating any possibility for political interference especially in appointment processes;

The idea that common institutions can work for the benefit of everyone, with impartiality and objectivity, and not just pretend to do so, is remote from Greek public life. This is why Mr Tsipras is believed when he speaks of the EU as an instrument of “extreme neoliberal” capitalists and other elites.

Never said it would. And it is not the welfare state by itself that created the crisis. Greece was less in debt than italy currently is at the beginning of the crisis. Yet, Italy is not as much in debt as greece despite sharing many of the same problems. What i am saying is that if cutting the welfare state down would make things even worse, that shouldn't be the focus.

&gt; You really think shipping and tourism being 30% of gdp while having high trade deficits, was sufficently funding greek spending promises? 

Actually, with the cut in public spending already done, they don't need any more cuts as long as they find a way to give work to do to their 25% unemployed. The welfare state isn't preventing them from getting a job, the crisis does. The focus should be unemployment, not reducing a welfare state as that reduction would only be detrimental right now.

On the long term, there is the question of pension but it is a given it will be adressed. Even tsipras agreed to that.

Id probably shoot up both and hope either one answers fast. 

To stay in Germany as a foreigner you simply need a reason. Studies, work or a language studies are reasons. Problem with the language studies is that since you just came out of a studies visa makes it harder as youre not expected to be able to do much with it further. It might still be possible. Its just what I read about language visas and how they are very strict in connecting them with other visas. (for example if you intend to stay after the language visa to start your studies, you need to make this known even before the language visa, otherwise you will not be able to gain a studies visa).

&gt;I'm starting to think that it may be a smarter choice to just work back in the states and take German courses their until I receive an acceptance from a Masters Program next year.

Id start to plan for this, but still try anything you can to continue to stay here.

In that case there are no negotiations necessary: if they're producing stuff that is already good enough for our current standards, they already can import it.

This is what i meant, Germany  refused to admit that the new Greek goverment was right about the fact that the previous bailouts were unsustainable, precisely to apease this type of voters, but like it happen in Finland the lack of a decisive solution only made this voters group grow, to a point that they are the majority of the population. So, to not lose votes Merkel insisted on further austerity, austerity didnt work, more people get frustaded with Greece, Merkel is forced to push for more austerity not to lose even more votes, it keeps not working, more people get frustated with Greece and so on. 5 years ago it would be unpopular to give a bailout without making the greeks suffer, but not enough to end such a popular politic carrer (I think), but now it impossible to do the right thing. I though that Merkel would rise above and fight the abismal misinforming that goes on in German media, but she didnt, know is to late anyway. So many lives are being ruined, and the people that are getting affected many of them wont get a second chance to bounce up. I read somewhere that that germans are the people in europe that reads more political/economial news, about 60% do it on regular bases, the country is developed, the people tolerant and educated how can such a bias conservative media take root ?

J'en prends deux si j'en ai besoin plus tard. 

Ce qui nous fait 480 cinqs, lui même un multiple de 5 (96 x 5)

Across the board? Why should they be dropped at all?

&gt; Why would it be that way round? 

Because American companies are big and profitable and have leverage. The reason they have trade problems with Europe is because they have lower standards. They wouldn't need a trade agreement to raise their standards, they could simply meet those standards. Therefore, the purposes of the agreement can only reasonably be said to lower European standards. Don't believe me?

*Edit:

The imperfections of a monetary union without a political or fiscal union have been debated since the 80s, but because today's financial systems are so interrelated and complex, no one could ever conclusively answer the question of what happens when one country refuses to cut spending and tries to ""print money"". Greece wanted to print money through the bank door by writing of ECB loans. It didnt work, and now we know the answer to what happens, and our Union is stronger for it.

This was never about if the Euro exchange rate is too ""strong"" (or only in the sense that interest rates affect xrates). Devaluation is always only the best of the worst options for the majority of the people, even though it can solve some otherwise difficult to solve problems (by effectively making everyone poorer). The consequential reduction in imports and increase in domestic production is good on paper, but people forget this means people can only buy potatoes instead of imported bananas or meat or chocolate. Anyone here who thinks devaluation will help the Greeks has never lived with a devalued currency.

Questo ragionamento permetterebbe effettivamente di aumentare le probabilità dell'esistenza di Dio se non fosse erroneo alla radice: ti consiglio di ricercare l'Observation Bias e il principio antropico.

Ogni essere senziente in grado di farsi questa domanda ha dovuto trovarsi in una situazione che ne permettesse l'evoluzione e lo sviluppo di capacità cognitive. Poniamo un mondo senza Dio, in cui le condizioni che hanno portato allo sviluppo della specie umana hanno probabilità bassissime, ma proprio infinitesimali:

* Nella maggior parte dei casi non accade nulla: nessuno si chiede niente.

* In quel caso su miliardi in cui nasce l'uomo, si chiederà perchè le cose sono andate così bene.

Ci sono due possibilità, ma solo in una qualcuno pone la domanda: **In ogni caso in cui l'uomo si sviluppa gli parrà di aver avuto una fortuna inspiegabile se non con Dio, indipendentemente dalle probabilità iniziali**. Conclusione: il Bias dell'Osservatore impedisce di dare poca importanza alla fortuna, siccome le uniche situazioni in cui qualcuno si fa la domanda sono quelle in cui le cose sono andate bene, anche se le probabilità erano minime. Non si può avere alcun dato sulla probabilità delle condizioni che ci hanno portato a essere qui basandosi solo sulla contemplazione.

If you are seeing the most negative Roma/Romani groups as in line with the radical left in opposition to the status quo, I think you're wrong. They disrupt life for the every day person, which doesn't affect those who are making all the money and running the show. There are patriarchal, hierarchal structures within the groups, and leaders of clans often exploit others in clans to make themselves rich and women are forced into prostitution and marriage at very young ages. Various clans may also want nothing to do with other clans. There is almost no similarity between their lifestyle and the anar-commune or squatter types, which discourage hierarchy, do not view the general public as targets (aside from begging), do not exploit others, do not use physical violence or threat of to help get what they want or keep what they took, and theoretically wish to be inclusive and cooperative even though there is an issue with them forming in/out groups. There are always exceptions of course. 

You'll also notice many making a distinction between the types they're frustrated with, many of which have recently come from Eastern Europe once some EE countries were allowed into the EU, and those that have integrated much better or fully. Meaning, the frustration is with the lifestyle and how it negatively impacts those around them, not because they don't have the same ethnic background. Of course nationalists may sweepingly think that way, but that applies to everyone not exactly like them, even people who may be even more similar to them and just don't have the right ancestors.

It is debatable if it could not have worked out no matter what. The only thing we know for sure is that it did not work out. It is not missinformation it is another stance to say that the Troika and the Greeks possibly had a solution. Also I guess you don't consume german news apart from what you see in the BILD (Which is as I said utter trash). If you watch the news from the publicly owned channels for example these are way more balanced and show that there is also support to keep greece. 

It is just a bit of the german attitude maybe that if you take debt you have to pay back and we just can't stand it if people don't do the reforms. Also our politicians tried over and over again to reach an agreement with Athens but by now they already alienated the other countries even more.

* For the first week, pack exactly what you think you'll need/want to wear. This makes you comfortable after arrival and magically covers all the basics.
* Then, just fill the suitcase by priority of what you'd like to wear/have around. Again, bring the stuff that you most likely want to wear; whether this is your best or 'worst' outfit.
* Check whether you have enough variety (cold/warm, formal/leisure)
* Don't buy anything in the US before you leave unless you know for sure you'll need it.
* Don't plan on buying anything right after you get there  unless you know for sure you'll need it. (You have time to figure this out. If you are in a rural area, you will find it difficult to find larger super markets or department stores.)

&gt;Thousands upon thousands of government employees take to the streets to protest the bill. Here is Greece’s version of the Tea Party: tax collectors on the take, public-school teachers who don’t really teach, well-paid employees of bankrupt state railroads whose trains never run on time, state hospital workers bribed to buy overpriced supplies. Here they are, and here we are: a nation of people looking for anyone to blame but themselves. The Greek public-sector employees assemble themselves into units that resemble army platoons. In the middle of each unit are two or three rows of young men wielding truncheons disguised as flagpoles. Ski masks and gas masks dangle from their belts so that they can still fight after the inevitable tear gas. “The deputy prime minister has told us that they are looking to have at least one death,” a prominent former Greek minister had told me. “They want some blood.” Two months earlier, on May 5, during the first of these protest marches, the mob offered a glimpse of what it was capable of. Seeing people working at a branch of the Marfin Bank, young men hurled Molotov cocktails inside and tossed gasoline on top of the flames, barring the exit. Most of the Marfin Bank’s employees escaped from the roof, but the fire killed three workers, including a young woman four months pregnant. As they died, Greeks in the streets screamed at them that it served them right, for having the audacity to work. The events took place in full view of the Greek police, and yet the police made no arrests.

&gt; During the extension, Greece will refrain from ""unilateral action that would undermine the fiscal targets, economic recovery and financial stability,"" Varoufakis wrote.

I quoted this somewhere else, you can easily find it through googling these statements. 

&gt; ""Major impact of budget"" you mention, yet the ""Humanitarian crisis bill"" that SYRIZA passed created a havoc ( got warned it will be perceived as unilateral action - confirms the Varoufakis quote ) and it would have a maximum -true- €500 million impact over the year.

500 million *is* a major impact, given greeces financial situation. I dont really wanna argue if limiting this kind action is actually the right thing. 

&gt; The parliament indeed is responsible for lawmaking but most major bills come from the government party and a major law isn't just ""we voted it, good job"", but a more complicated process until it's on effect.

I never claimed something else. However, the people negotiating are Tsipras, the FinMin and some assistance. There are a lot of Syriza MPs that do *not* negotiate with the institutions. These people can work out possible ways to tackle corruption, they can work out possbile legislation. Just working on it wont bother anyone - quite the opposite. If syriza was able to bring final proposals of legislation into the negotiations with the institutions, they would surely be pretty happy.


&gt; It was mentioned above ""close loopholes of tax system"" - and there's the problem. Due to additional over additional legislation the Greek tax system is complicated as fuck which allows the loopholes. It needs to be completely rewritten.

Nevertheless I do know how the uni application works (this means I was doing the nurse apprenticeship to higher my chances of getting into med school).

The website to apply for all medical schools in Germany is hochschulstart.de, expect if you're going to a private one but prepare to pay a lot for that. You are required to have the German Abitur or a school leaving certificate that compares to that. You can check on the website anabin.de if your high school leaving certificate is enough.

Foreign students are also required to have good German skills, that means on the European common frame you should be a C1. To prove that you know German you should take a exam, like Test DaF, DSH and many others. 

Keep in mind that it's really hard to get into med school and the averages (NC) is really high. Therefore many students do apprenticeships (like nursing, medical assistance and many others in the health industry), do a year of volunteering work (FSJ), take tests (like TMS) or just wait, because waiting time is actually beneficial in Germany. 

I hope this wasn't too confusing, but it should give you an idea on how the process is.

If *that* causes your housing and job markets to go out of whack, then you were already having problems before the EU influence. Try building more houses.

A much larger amount of immigrants (more than twice that amount) are from non-EU countries. Which I suspect is, for a large part, from your former colonies. So... don't have such a colonial past? Is that a useful tip?

You probably didn't. Because if you would, you would know that I linked OECD data from the earliest possible date, which was after the reunification.

&gt; The other stuff I don't disagree with (except for the blog), but how is it relevant that Germany increaased the exports to non-EU relative to EU? That's an argument in my favour. It shows that Germany did good to stay competitive globally.

I explained it. Germany freeloaded Eurozone till 2009 by keeping wages frozen in direct violation of 2% ECB inflation rate. Essentially *took advantage* of the other countries and created a huge competitiveness gap inside Eurozone. After 2009, domestic demand in periphery had falled drastically and Germany started exporting more outside EZ. Basically freeloading euro which is a weak currency compared to what Germany would have. Germany went from a 30% GDP exports to almost 50% in the euro era. That is absurd.

Welch ein Zufall, auf diesem Fall basiert der ganze Thread.

&gt;http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/polizei-justiz/brandanschlag-auf-geplantes-fluechtlingsheim-in-zossen-rechtsextreme-verdaechtige-auf-freiem-fuss/11786092.html

Anschlag auf ein *geplantes* Flüchtlingsheim. Sprich auf eine Baustelle, nicht auf Menschen. Aber nun gut, es ist ein nachgewiesener Fall.

&gt;Die richtig kranken Fälle Tröglitz, Vorra und Meißen lässt Du ja nicht gelten, weil ""nicht erwiesen"" (xD), usw. Scheiß drauf.

Darf ich dich an Khaled Bahray erinnern? Da galt ein rechtsextremer Hintergrund auch als sicher. Als die Polizei nur andeutete auch in andere Richtungen zu ermitteln, gab es einen epischen Shitstorm und Drohungen aus allen Ecken. Am Ende hat ihn sein Mitbewohner umgebracht, der vorher ständig was von Nazis herbeifantasierte. Und irgendwie hat es ohne Nazis kaum jemanden mehr interessiert:

http://www.taz.de/!5022637/

Also ja, wegen genau solcher Geschichten sollte man sich nicht zu sehr auf einen bestimmten Bereich einschießen, am Ende sieht es oft ganz anders aus.

&gt;https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/fremdenfeindliche-uebergriffe-101.html

Ui, das klingt viel. Aber siehe da:

&gt;Sachbeschädigung ist der Straftatbestand, wegen dem mit Abstand am häufigsten ermittelt wird. Was genau jeweils beschädigt wurde und wie schwer der Schaden war, das geht aus der Statistik nicht hervor. Es folgen Delikte wie Volksverhetzung, Hausfriedensbruch oder Aufforderung zu Straftaten.

&gt;Findet sich auf der Fassade eines Flüchtlingsheimes ein Hakenkreuz, dann vermutet das BKA einen rechtsextremen Hintergrund. Wer im Einzelnen aber hinter Anschlägen auf Unterkünfte - wie beispielsweise Sachbeschädiguingen - steckt, lässt sich oft schwer ermitteln und es geht auch aus der Statistik des BKA nicht hervor.

Auch hier wieder mal nichts Konkretes, sondern nur Vermutungen.

Du konntest also genau **ein** konkretes Beispiel für einen Angriff von rechts bringen. Ansonsten nur eine aufgepumpte Statistik, die überwiegend auf Vermutungen basiert, wie offen zugegeben wird. Aber hey, die armen Asylbewerber werden das wohl kaum selbst machen.

But of course there's a historic reason for all of this. Roma/gypsies were basically slaves, and the most oppressed kind of slaves that we ever had around here. They still do the lowest-level jobs in Romania (e.g. most garbage men are Roma). They were never really integrated into the society - you have to understand, this was always a gargantuan task(eg. for a long time the state tried to oblige them to send the children to school, to provide incentives to do so etc... but many still don't want to), and our society is dysfunctional anyway on many levels, so we never got to complete this effort. It's not that nobody tried.... it's just damn hard. And we're not capable enough, from a pure administrative pov, to tackle such a big problem.

I hope the situation will get better in time. There's a great Romanian film called ""Aferim"". Find it, get some english subtitles, watch it. You'll understand some of the roots of the problem.

Arbeitstechnisch war die Woche schön ruhig. Alles hat gepasst, kein Stress, wie man es sich wünscht. Hab dem Kunden einen Extrawunsch erfüllt, dafür ein Lob vom Chef, was will man mehr :)

Privat war so eher meh. Letzten Sonntag ist mein Rechner auf einmal ausgegangen und ließ sich nicht mehr starten. Verfickter Fickfick! Von Montag bis Donnerstag war ich dann ertmal unterwegs, so dass ich dann erst Donnerstag Abend dazu gekommen bin, mich dem Problem mal anzunehmen. 

Ursache war ein Kondensator auf dem Mainboard, den nen polnischen Abgang gemacht hat. Also neues Mainboard, und wo ich grade dabei war, auch nen neuen Prozessor und eine SSD fürs Betriebssystem. Alles eingebaut und installiert, jetzt läuft die Kiste wieder. Bin grade dabei, mein Skyrim-Setup neu zusammenzubasteln. Glück im Unglück war, dass ich grade eine schicke Nebenkostenrückzahlung von meiner Ex-Vermieterin bekommen hab.

Gestern hat mein Dad im kleinen Geburtstag gefeiert, das war sehr schön. Meine Nichte hat grade die erste Klasse erfolgreich hinter sich gebracht. Da konnte ich mich als einziger Onkel natürlich nicht lumpen lassen und hab ihr zu dem Anlass einen Schülerlaborkasten gekauft, der dann auch erstmal in Betrieb genommen werden musste!

They're the Green party! Whether you agree or disagree with their hostility towards non-renewables, they were evidently elected in Hamburg on that platform.

I also take issue with his justification for the Phillip Morris case. He seems to have mischaracterised people's disagreement with it as a suggestion that it's legally dubious.

Plus Muslims were given no choice to declare themselves Bosniaks (a term that was used first roughly 600 years ago) throughout Yugoslavia. Either Muslim Serb, Croat, or undecided Yugoslav was used instead due to the type of history you're claiming. All of this ignores the religious and cultural isolation of the Bosna region, which resulted in a separate identity and religion (with the Bosnian church, although it didn't survive Vatican attacks), even before the ottoman invasion.

The history of Bosnia is tough to simplify, but it is not the same as it's neighbors, and hasn't been for a very long time. This paragraph is straight from the wiki on Bosniaks : 

""Contrary to frequent Serb and Croat nationalist claims, Bosnia and Herzegovina constitutes a historical entity which has its own identity and its own history.[64] These two neighbors have, indeed, occupied parts of its territory, but only for brief periods of time and, as such, neither Serbia nor Croatia has any serious historical claims to Bosnia.[64][65] Moreover, although Bosnia did interact with its Serb and Croat neighbors over the centuries, it had a very different history and culture from them.[66] John Kinnamos, a late 12th-century Byzantine historian, reports that Bosnia was not subordinated; rather the Bosnians had their own distinct way of life and government.[67] According to American historian John V.A. Fine, a leading authority on medieval Balkan history,[68][69] the Bosnians (Bošnjani) have been a distinct people since at least the 10th century.[70]""",null,0,null,1436728397,null,0,false,0,ct0wr9m,null,t3_3cxlfb,null,t1_ct0wr9m,null,t1_ct08g5p,null,null,null,1437799307,null,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1,null

However the thing is that reunification of Romania and Moldova is not something you can do like that without preparation or a transitory period. It would mean that all Romanian laws (and therefore EU laws) should apply to Moldova, and that's precisely what we would ask from Moldova if it tried to enter the EU in its own right. So either Moldova first makes all the reforms necessary to join Romania, which would be the same as making those reforms to join the EU; or Moldova joins Romania immediately but there is some transitory period to adapt the law and so on. In this second case, the EU could complain that its laws are not respected in a part of Romania.

Heute ein wenig verspätet da wir noch gegrillt haben.

Noch 7 Wochen bis Abgabe der Bachelorarbeit, diese Woche war fast keine Motivation da aber ich habe jetzt den Großteil des praktischen Teils abgeschlossen und kann mit dem Schreiben anfangen.

Donnerstag kam ein Umschlag von der Bank, ""bla bla, ihre Kontoumstellung auf [anderer Kontotyp]"". Nach 4 Telefonaten und einem Besuch in der Filiale kam raus, dass im Vertrag absolut nichts davon steht und ich dem niemals zugestimmt habe, die Bank allerdings mein Konto umgestellt hat, weil ich keine Studienbescheinigung vorgelegt habe. Die Frau in der Filiale hat gar nicht richtig geschnallt warum ich denn so einen Aufstand mache und meinte, das stünde doch alles im Vertrag. Das archivierte Original habe ich mir dann ausdrucken lassen und wie zu erwarten stand dazu nichts drinnen. Jedenfalls habe ich dann mit der Bitte, nie wieder ohne meine Zustimmung etwas an meinem Konto zu ändern, die Umstellung auf den alten Kontotyp erzwungen und werde jetzt so schnell wie möglich wechseln.

Für mich ein absolutes Unding dass die Bank sich einfach das Recht rausnimmt, derartig in mein Konto einzugreifen und das werde ich definitiv auch so dem Vorstand mitteilen. Keine Ahnung ob es Zufall ist, aber PayPal konnte diese Woche nicht automatisch das Geld für Spotify abbuchen und gestern konnte meine EC-Karte nicht gelesen werden. Richtig nervige Scheiße, fick die BW-Bank.

Freitag dann noch ein Gespräch mit einer Abteilung wegen einer Stelle gehabt, die Abteilung (bzw. auch der Bereichsleiter) wollen mich wohl ziemlich laut HR-Tante und so verlief dann auch das Gespräch. Naja, das Projekt klingt relativ interessant, allerdings habe ich ja nach wie vor nicht vor, in der Firma zu bleiben.

Bewerbungsgespräch hier in Deutschland sind übrigens ziemlich komisch, finde ich. Wie will man die Qualität eines Entwicklers beurteilen ohne auch nur eine Zeile Code zu sehen?

Morgen geht es nach der Arbeit mit den anderen Studenten ins Sausalitos, das könnte ganz lustig werden.

Merkel has no special powers in Europe nor does she want them. Yet for years now she's the centerpoint because germany is one of the few countries that take Europe seriously.

Focus on domestic Greece policies like property taxes instead of VATs which hurts consumption and thus will hurt the economy( Japan is a prime example of how not to do it). Stop demanding horizontal pension cuts or military budget reduction, because again it will increase deflationary pressure and should only be done when Greece is out of recession.

That's the point I'm making. Neither the US government nor the EU wants them dropped, yet you're convinced they'll be dropped. I'm trying to work out what basis you have for that belief.

&gt;Because American companies are big and profitable and have leverage. The reason they have trade problems with Europe is because they have lower standards. They wouldn't need a trade agreement to raise their standards, they could simply meet those standards. Therefore, the purposes of the agreement can only reasonably be said to lower European standards. Don't believe me?

Yes, I don't believe you. And I think you should read up about the supposed ""dropping"" of pesticide regulation, because it has been shelved, not dropped, and shelved because the lobbyists were threatening to put pressure on the TTIP talks as a way of getting what they wanted in the pesticides regulation. Shelving it until after the TTIP talks removes a hostage.

It's also worth pointing out that the US *doesn't* have lower standards across the board compared to the EU. In some areas they've traditionally led Europe.

&gt;Jesus wept dude, have you even read any of the opposition to TTIP? 

Lots and lots and lots of it. Hell, I've also read some of the pro-TTIP stuff too.

&gt;I personally can't explain why Europe would compromise it's standards, but they are - chances are for the hope of making money. 

But ""Europe"" doesn't make money that way - if it did, it could make money very simply and quickly by dropping all standards in Europe. The US could do the same in the US. But they don't.

Lobbyists are lobbying about TTIP. The very same lobbyists lobby the EU, the US, national governments and regulators all the time, looking for exactly the same things. Yet suddenly the same regulators who somehow manage to cope with that lobbying pressure the other 365 days of the year will cave utterly to it in TTIP? Because ""markets""?

Makes no sense.

&gt;That's not a conspiracy, that's just common sense. The point is that if people don't push back against some of what TTIP is suggesting, we'll get steamrolled.

For the Hamburg case, what might have made the difference is that the city government was acting in bad faith. I.e. the city government kept raising and raising standards not because it was backed by any sort of impact studies or whatever they had done, but as a legal stalling strategy with the sole aim of preventing construction of the plant.

 An excerpt:
&gt;Thirdly, the BSU arbitrarily increased tho duration afthe monitoring phase for
the efficiency of the so-called ""fish-stair"" in the river Elbe 4 from one year to
two years, which could delay the start of the operation of the plal)t by one year. 

Secondly, another part of the reasoning was that there was a previous agreement with the city government before the elections which was effectively reneged on at great cost to Vattenfall. 

&gt; Investments may not be...expropriated ... [unless] (d) accompanied by the payment of
prompt, adequate and effective compensation. 

I suppose in this case the reasoning was that the prior agreement and issue of a permit counted as sunk cost as part of an investment which was effectively expropriated. Whether companies should be compensated in situations like this e.g. nationalisation is a matter for politics, but it seems reasonable to me. You might disagree.

No. Just no. Where have you heard this nonsense?

No. You have 7+ million immigrants from outside the EU. Those are not 7 million highly skilled workers. If it were, your labor market would be *way more* fucked up, because it would be impossible for your white, Anglo-saxon college graduates to find a job.

This sounds like the job and housing markets are just excuses, and it's just about power. It's about control. It's about sovereignty. It's about wanting to decide everything yourself as the UK, even if the decisions being taken at the EU level are good for you.

Cela vient du fait qu'ils doivent faire la déclaration à l'ursaaf lors de l'embauche, et qu'ils controlent les déclarations.

Sur les sites du service public, il est écrit qu'il faut fournir une promesse d'embauche ou un contrat de travail: Rien ne mentionne que tu as l'autorisation de travailler. Par contre, tu peux certainement avoir un contrat de travail qui te conditionne à l'obtention avant une certaine date de ton autorisation de travail (un peu dans le même genre de la clause qui t'oblige à faire la visite médicale obligatoire, par ex). Sans ça, l'employeur peut se mettre hors la loi.

Tout au plus, tu auras le droit de signer un contrat en CDD avec certes max 768 heures travaillées (ce que ton statut d'étudiant te permet de base - mais je le déconseille également, vu qu'un CDD c'est pas super vendeur dans le dossier...), ou te fournir une promesse d'embauche ou un draft de contrat pour que la DIRECCTE du département donne son avis à la pref pour savoir si oui ou non le changement de statut est cohérent avec le CV et l'état du marché du travail du coin.

Si tu as des doutes et que l'employeur est sérieux, et pour l'acceptation du dossier, tu devrais surement te rapprocher auprès d'un avocat spécialisé du droit des étrangers dans le coin où tu vas poser ton dossier: Comme certains textes sont flous et leur interprétation libre, les préfectures font un peu ce qu'elles veulent parfois, et avoir comme interlocuteur un conseil spécialisé est la meilleure chose à faire.

null,false,prolificwriter,null,null,null,"GREECE SHOULD EXIT THE EUROZONE BEFORE ITS TOO LATE:

Although well intentioned, the monetary union between the European countries has proven to be a flawed idea that has eventually begun to cause serious cracks in the structure of the Eurozone erected barely 16 years ago.

Having experienced the disastrous consequences of the world wars I and II first hand, the proponents of the idea decided to unify Europe by forming a monetary union aimed at preventing armed conflict between their countries once and for all. They tried to create political stability in Europe through economic union without giving much thought to the inherently corrupt nature of the political cultures and economic conditions of some of their member states.The EU policy makers simply failed to perceive the threats some of the politically corrupt countries within their ranks- Greece being the worst of all- could pose to the very existence of the union they worked so eagerly to form between the European countries.

Unfortunately, that dire eventuality has finally been realized in the form of Greece's financial crisis that could literally lead Greece to a financial meltdown and cause a serious damage to the unity and structural integrity of the Eurozone as a whole.

Should the negotiations currently underway between the leaders of the Eurozone countries fail, the grave repercussions of this awful debacle will be felt all around the world. I, for one, am strongly of the view that Greece should simply exit the Eurozone and rebuild its entire economic system right from the scratch. Who cares about the bail out. Greeks can rest assured of the extreme suffering and hardships that lie ahead for them for at east the next 3 to 4 years with or without the bail out.

With such a prospects on the horizon, they might as well exit the Eurozone rather sooner than later. Once out of the Eurozone, they should make a point of electing competent people to run their governments, tear down the existing corrupt system which unfortunately pervades each and every aspect of their society and build anew an economic system in tune with the realities of the times and most importantly free of corruption. They must remember that the austerity measures imposed by the Eurozone will keep the Greeks tied to the chains of bondage for a much longer period than they could imagine. As such, their reliance and dependence on the IMF and Euronzone hand outs will continue on for many more years to come.

The current brain drain caused by the economic turmoil poses a grave threat to the future of Greece as a whole. For those Greeks who are leaving the country to seek better life elsewhere, should stay in the country and build it brick by brick by tearing down the old socio-economic structures so as to build a better life right there, in their own country (although easier said than done), if not for themselves, at least for their children and the future generations to come!",null,0,null,1436730005,null,0,false,0,ct0xlrm,null,t3_3c8lwo,null,t1_ct0xlrm,null,t3_3c8lwo,null,null,null,1437799792,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

No, it doesn't.  Not at all.  The US works *very differently* from the EU.

The US collects taxes from all residents at the same rate, and pays out all federal benefits to residents under a uniform system.

If people earning more money and using fewer benefits live in state A, and people in state B earn less and rely on more benefits, then the citizens living in State A, collectively, will have paid out more than they received in benefits, collectively...and the opposite will be true for people living in State B. 

But these aren't equalization payments.  The US, at no point, actually decides to send a particular state $50 B - as would have to happen in the EU.  The state has nothing to do with it in the US; these numbers simply reflect individuals paying federal taxes and individuals receiving federal benefits.  You can aggregate them into states if you want, but they really have nothing to do with states per se - if I move from Delaware to IN, my federal tax rate doesn't change, nor do my social security benefits. 

(Some federal spending doesn't come from benefits, of course, and is spending for roads, military bases, national parks, airports, and other infrastructure projects.  But, again, these are done by the federal government according to its own laws; there is no specific transfer to a certain state as there would be in the EU in the case of Greece.)",null,0,null,1436730036,null,0,false,0,ct0xmcq,null,t3_3cuj5o,null,t1_ct0xmcq,null,t1_ct05om5,null,null,null,1437799797,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

There's this constant revisionist tendency among the bosniak nationalists to invent a history for their people that is somehow completely separate from Serbs and Croats but that is evidently impossible.

Milan Nedic's Parade of Serbian Nazi Collaborators in Belgrade (22 June 1944) is shown in this historic video.

&gt; The oppression of Jews in Serbia started before the arrival of Hitler's occupying forces. Six months before the Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia, Serbia voluntarily passed the legislation restricting Jewish participation in the economy, education and employment. One year later, on 22 October 1941, anti-Semitic ""Grand Anti-Masonic Exhibit"" was funded by Serbia's capital city, Belgrade.

&gt;We describe the main economic arguments posed for and against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during the U.S. policy debate. To evaluate these arguments, we analyze recent trade data and survey post-NAFTA studies. We find that both the U.S. and Mexico benefit from NAFTA, with much larger relative benefits for Mexico. NAFTA also has had little effect on the U.S. labor market. **These results confirm the consensus opinion of economists at the time of the debate.** Finally, studies find that trade creation greatly exceeds trade diversion in the region under NAFTA, especially in intermediate goods.

Developing good cars is connected to billions of euros/dollars of investments. Money that greece does not have and that nobody is willing to invest there.

Socialist states might have a lower unemployment rate, the living standard is 10 times worse though. Look at the GDR vs. West Germany.

With this decision by Germany and others who have calculated that it would likely be easier to squash Greece, this has now officially turned the EU into a Zero-sum game. This means that the future of the EU will not be based on solidarity but ferocious and ruthless zero-sum mentality, it is basically a Pandoras Box that is now opened, which can never be closed again. 

Now that the EU is a zero-sum game, that means each country will play by their own rules to maximize benefit even if it is small amount. Russian sanctions? they will be vetoed immediately next vote. Why should Greece/Italy/France/Spain who depend the most on Russian trade suffer from these sanctions when the Pro-Grexit bloc(which is ironically extreme anti-russians) only want them?

These civil servants will leak documents, make uncomfortable statements or otherwise undermine the sitting government in front of the creditors or public. The fact the institutions are large and inefficient protects them, there's probably barely oversight or clear management.

But don't overestimate our politicians either. Most of them are far from intellectuals, and would struggle to tie their laces. And corruption is not alien to these lands either, only it's better hidden, and involves larger transactions, and is sometimes semi-legal in the eyes of the law.

&gt;Firstly he says Greece needs additional finance of €82-86bn - which would boost debt to well over 200% GDP.

&gt;A ""bonkers"" prospect, he exclaims.  

&gt;Secondly, Greek banks need additional capital of up to €25bn to absorb losses from the implosion of the economy - caused by forced bank closures.

If rest of the Europe approved the new proposal and we would need to try to pass it through our parliament, there is a very high chance of our government collapsing. This would sink our economy as we are in the middle of starting reforms.

The Finns Party has campaigned againts the bailouts ever since the beginning, at all turns of the crisis.

The EP is more democratic than your own parliament where ~35% of the people voted for the country that decides 100% of the policy for the next few years. And the important, impactful things are not decided by ""some bureaucrat"" but by the leaders of the countries, where the UK has a much bigger hammer than most EU countries.

&gt; like when they deposed a democratically elected Greek leader last year because he didn't fit their agenda.

Really? This is complete nonsense. Are you going to accuse the EU of Euromaidan next?

The articles you linked talk about ""hundreds"" of people. While you have ~10 million of non-UK-born people in the UK. Why do you care about this? This has zero impact on your life. Nor on any significant statistic for the UK.

No administrative system is 100% perfect, but people whose job it is are working on improving such systems. That's their job. Are you also interested in other parts of the UK's administrative apparatus, where some weird rule means that a few hundred more people from the UK get treated differently than how you instinctively feel they should? Perhaps an issue about a parking regulation in Birmingham?

&gt; we have organised international criminal gangs exploiting this free movement policy and massive increases in crime in city centres directly due to it

&gt;  I think this is a priority in the short term where as reducing immigration in general is more of a long term goal, along with building more houses, not something that can be done overnight, like scrapping these ridiculous laws.

Can you specify which laws? 

Oh, and also: **YOU WILL NOT SCRAP/REDUCE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE WITHIN THE EU**. Not now, not next year, not in ten years.

It's not a matter of choosing a number of people for whom it's ok. It's a 100% fundamental principle on which the EU is founded. You guys should know, you were there. It's not possible to ""reduce"" this or scrap it. And if the UK honestly tries it anyway, to somehow ""negotiate it in"" under the guise of avoiding a brexit (hoping for a repeat of the Scotland referendum, where Scotland got a much better deal, to convince them to stay), then I honestly hope we kick you ungrateful little fuckers out.

As the future progresses, most people move towards more international cooperation, freedom and friendship. It's sad that certain political factions (and tabloids) seem hellbent on convincing the people of the UK that this is not good for them, that it's much more important to them to keep reminding themselves of what a unique snowflake the UK is, than to do what is best for its people and the country.",null,0,null,1436733232,null,0,false,0,ct0zcom,null,t3_3cxcb9,null,t1_ct0zcom,null,t1_ct0xysa,null,null,null,1437800711,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

2) The conditions that are so often talked about are simply the conditions requested to Greece in order for Greece to receive the final ˜€7b of the second bail out package.

3) The conditions set forth today are about a new deal, a third bail out package, of circa €86b. Hence the stakes are much higher.

I'm not sure I agree with how it's being handled (even though I'm in favour of Grexit). I never thought a 3rd bailout would work. If the current debt was unsustainable, then what about current debt plus €86b? How would that ever work?

By all means do. And stop trying to take over sovereignty over another country while you are at it. Ask your people that: do you believe Greece should become a ward of the Eurozone. 

&gt;Greece's economy was improving towards the end of 2014 and early 2015 (similar to Spain, Portugal and Italy), and then Syriza screwed everything down.

There was a portuguese government official who unironically said something I think was pretty revealing (and he said it as a boast):""Portugal is doing better, the portuguese aren't."". He thought this was a point in favour of his government.

Fact is, Syriza or no Syriza the money wasn't there for the huge payments spike in the month of June.

Austerity doesn't work. No credible economist believes it to work. No country where it has been applied has seen positive results in terms of debt reduction or sustainability. Inequality is massively increased by austerity.

Austerity doesn't work because the poor are the majority, and if you keep implementing policies to fuck them over they are going to kick you out of government. You can't run a economic policy based on spreadsheets and numbers alone and forget that there are people living a difficult to impossible life because of it. Samaras learned it the hard way, and the Portuguese and Spanish government are set to receive some harsh lessons on that come next election. Which i'm sure you'd prefer were not held.

I understand that people disagree with some of the demands. But I agree with the principle.

When Greece asked for the first two bailouts it had to abdicate some sovereignty to the 18 nations abdicating some of their capital. Now that it needs a third bailout Greece is asked to abdicate some more.

Greece is free to keep its sovereignty if the other 18 countries can keep their capital.

This is after all what a federal Europe would entitle, European solidarity in exchange for sovereignty pooling.

At this moment only Greece needs the solidarity therefore only Greece pools their sovereignty.

Another example of divergence is the minimum wage debate.

Didn't Greece already accept privatization some years back, then see little movement happening?

My understanding is that Greece has had problems with an overweight public sector.  One way to deal with that is to privatize the state-owned enterprise, and have the new owners will lay off a lot of people.  I also understood that substantial commitment was earlier made to privatize state government.

I don't know whether the scope was the same, but this sounds to me like someone saying ""You promised, as a condition of receiving money earlier, to reform the government.  One of these was to privatize a certain amount, and you did only a small fraction of that.  If you want more money, either privatize, we will perform the privatization process if it's too politically-difficult for you, or you can forego the money.""

Now, maybe that's a bad idea (personally, I think that privatization of uncompetitive government-owned operations would probably strengthen Greece, though I'm no expert), but it's something that Greece *had* already said that it would do as a condition for funds before, yes?

Regardless of if you think that certain Germans wanted this from the start, actions of Syriza have empowered them take many of the actions that they are.

I mean, I don't see Germany as a country taking such a hard line this long into the negotiations without Syriza calling for nazi debt repayments, calling them terrorists, sending V. to lecture them at meeting after meeting, etc... for the past 6 months.  That doesn't even touch the shit said during the campaigning.

What was accomplished by all this?  It sure as hell didn't strengthen their negotiating position.  In fact, it seems to have made it worse.

Why won't history blame Syriza for this and why aren't people blaming them more now?  They have certainly shot their people in the foot for nothing but political gains.

null,false,hamfter,BERL,Berlin,null,"""Gut finden"" ist meiner Meinung nach der falsche Ansatz für solche Texte, jedenfalls am Anfang, wenn man noch nicht wirklich durchsteigt. Es gibt meistens Gründe dafür, dass die Klassiker Klassiker sind, und solange ich diese Gründe nicht verstehe, halte ich mich normalerweise mit Geschmacksurteilen zurück. 

Auf dieser Grundlage: Faust 2 ist ein ziemlich schwieriger Text, und er verlangt einem wirklich Arbeit ab. Lohnt sich die Arbeit? Ja, finde ich schon. Wenn man keinen Zugang dazu findet, spricht aber überhaupt nix dagegen, das erstmal wegzulegen und stattdessen was zu lesen, mit dem man sich leichter tut. Es bringt nichts, sich durch so einen Text durchzuquälen, am Ende geht es nur hier rein und da wieder raus und man hat gar nichts davon (außer sagen zu können, dass man es mal gelesen hat).

Das Zeug läuft ja nicht weg, man kann immer noch in ein paar Jahren zurückkommen und einen neuen Anlauf starten - ist gar nicht so unwahrscheinlich, dass man dann besser klarkommt, bei mir war das jedenfalls schon oft so. Es ist generell gut, wenn man  Sachen liest, die einen aus der Komfortzone rausbefördern, aber wenn es trotz intensiven Versuchens wirklich gar nicht funktioniert, dann ist das auch kein Problem. Es gibt genug gute/wichtige Texte, mit denen man sich bestimmt leichter tut und mehr davon hat.

Ob man etwas ""gelesen haben sollte"", ist mMn auch nicht das *aller*wichtigste Kriterium. Allein der klassische Literaturkanon ist so groß, dass schon nur die wenigsten ihn in einem Leben bewältigen können.

Here's the quote:

&gt; The leaked proposal also suggests Greece hands over €50bn of “valuable Greek assets” over to eurozone authorities to be sold off over time! That would kick in if Greece cannot deliver “a significantly speeded up” privatisation programme.

Greece already agreed to perform a certain amount of privatizations before certain milestones some time back, and chose to not do so.  Signing that agreement, I would think, would have been the meaningful choice.  Okay, maybe Greece never intended to privatize from the get-go and considered this simply part of the politics, but Greece at least *said* that it wanted to make that trade.

In this case, what seems to be happening is someone saying ""either conform to your promises and privatize before the dealines, let us perform the privatization, or we don't really believe that *this* time the privatization will actually happen"".

I mean, if the EU used a special legal position to, say, seize state control, or if it marched armies in, that would be one thing.  But all that people are saying here is what any other creditor could as easily do.  They had a promise, it was broken, now they're saying that they can send someone in to fulfill that promise...but it's not as if their authority extends further than that.

I mean, I'd think that if Greece negotiated the earlier agreement in good faith, that the earlier agreement, in which it accepted privatizations, should represent as much a loss of sovereignty as this does: the two just differ if the intent was to not actually perform the promises.",null,0,null,1436734369,null,0,false,0,ct1008s,null,t3_3d0n44,null,t1_ct1008s,null,t1_ct0znv9,null,null,null,1437801086,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

This is double edged sword, however. The governments that did those reforms have been voted out of office for actually following through with the plan (to a certain extent).

The people voted for a populist left-wing politician that run on an anti-austerity campaign that claimed that he will control the markets and Merkel. Even after all this, they are still by far the most popular party in Greece.

Even so, even if Tsipras does get a deal and implements it quite efficiently. Can you guarantee that the Greek populace will not lean towards the next anti-Austerity populist party?

It is far too hard for a creditor to trust the Greek government and the populace. As a Greek, I am not proud to say this but I would not trust us either if I was in the creditor's position.

Germany is under no obligation to pay Greece anything...and if they don't trust Greece enough to cut a deal, that's fine...just say so and end it.

You can harp on about how the ""Greek government can't be trusted"" until the cows come home...and there is ample evidence that you are right about that. But what you can't do is pretend in any way that your government hasn't shown itself to be entirely contemptuous of other nations democratic sovereignty whenever they see fit.

The exception is the county I live in, where something like 1/3rd of properties, even really really rural ones (like your neighbour is a short drive away) are on FTTH. Mine is not, unfortunately, so I am on VDSL (though 30 seconds away there is FTTH)

Their proposed upgrade path is G.FAST, which will require running fibre to within a few tens of metres of the home, and placing expensive electronics everywhere, but have none of the inherent benefits of FTTH

Even yesterday I saw a telco worker in a pit doing some fibre splicing, probably for an expansion of FTTH there. If you can get FTTH from the telco in the UK, the maximum is 330Mbit down, 20 up. Most people go for the same packages as VDSL though - either 40/10 or 80/20. Some very small FTTH rollouts from other companies are gigabit

The telco here is just about to spend £12bn on buying a mobile network, and has already spent billions on football rights for their new sports channel, so it's not as if they don't have the money (especially since they're getting taxpayer money for the rural broadband rollouts)

UPD [The Guardian's live blog](http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/12/greek-debt-crisis-eu-leaders-meeting-cancelled-no-deal-live):

&gt;Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, is hearing that Alexis Tsipras is refusing to be beaten down, and is winning some concessions from creditors.

&gt;Tsipras may have sunk the idea that €50bn of Greek assets would be transferred to a Luxembourg fund (under the control of the German development bank KfW). It could be rather fewer assets, and it might not be Luxembourg either.

&gt;The Greek PM may even succeed in removing the threat of a temporary Grexit.",null,0,null,1436734699,null,0,1436745591,0,ct106w7,null,t3_3d1ooe,null,t1_ct106w7,null,t1_ct0z2au,null,null,null,1437801233,null,32,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,32,null

I get upset when people look at one outcome of a move and assume that this must be the goal from the start.

To me, it seems more to prevent more feet dragging by the Greeks.  Let's not forget, the troika extended billions in continued support to get the Greeks from Feb to June 30th while negotiations took place.

The Greeks burned through that money while calling the rest of the EU terrorists, sending V. to lecture other reps at negotiating meetings, etc..., etc...

Only *after* they had burned through billions in more loans while setting the economy of the country back even further did the Greeks finally bring serious concessions to the table.

As such, I see a reluctance of Germany to give more money or more deadline extensions as a way to protect themselves from the Greeks fucking around and trying to score cheap political points and racking up an ever increasing bill that the EU is going to be on the hook for, at least in the short term.

null,false,fuchsiamatter,EURO,European Union,null,"Loses, absolutely. The Greeks tried many revolutions before the one that stuck - they all ended in suppression and oppression, but are still remembered proudly. The 1821 revolution was also on the way to disaster and it was in fact that disaster that saved it: the third seige of Messologgi - in which Lord Byron died - managed to be both an unmitigated catastrophe for the Greek side and an absolutely glorious beginning, sparking Philhellenism in Europe which eventually led the European powers to back the Greeks, invervene in Navarino and essentially force the Ottomans to give Greece its freedom. 

WWII is the same story: yes, the Greeks beat the Italians for all the good it did them. Losing would have been better, as it would have led to a much more inefficient occupation by a less committed enemy. Winning just invited in the Germans, who steamrolled over the place. But the resistence continued, prompting Churchill to his famous quote about how Greeks don't fight like heroes, but heroes like Greeks: and again, Greece achieved more glory - and more sympathy - by losing, but losing valiently.

And even more recently in the junta, the student uprising at the Polytechnic is what is remembered, but in fact it had nothing to do with the fall of the colonels at all: they subdued the revolts and went on as normal, until they had the brilliant idea of invading Cyprus and spelling their own downfall. But it is the students fighting 9 months earlier that are remembered and they are remembered because they fought desperately and hopelessly for their freedom.

Even back in antiquity the same: as Horace put it, ""captive Greece led her captor captive‟. 

History is written by the winners, I have no argument there. But who is the winner is a more complicated question: not Ibrahim Pasha at Mesologgi, not the Axis occupiers of Greece, not Papadopoulos and his cronies. And - if things continue the way they're going now - not the hard-liner EZ countries either.

You just gave me the prime example of why a currency Union is good for the people, even without a political Union or transfer payments, even if it destroys the existing economy in its wake. 

The east Germans wanted the Dmark so bad they dissolved their own state and joined the west within 11 months to be able to use it and never regretted it. There were exceptionally large transfer payments, but those were not an economic necessity, those were made for social and political reasons.

The east Germans wanted the Dmark, to be able to buy ""western import goods"", as these were not affordable in Emarks. People believed that the Dmark would make them richer and they were right. BY switching currency everyone could afford to buy bananas and BMWs overnight. This caused living standard to rise to western standards within only a few months, at the cost of having to go through a painful economic reforms and dealing with economic realities equally fast. 

The Dmarks lowered interest rates and allowed access to capital markets, this stimulated growth. Again, cheaper imports came at a cost more expensive exports, which had serious effects on the heavy industries. People accepted this as a natural consequence, and reflecting economic realities and inefficiencies without distortion, and not as a downside. People knew that the means of production and the products themselves were crude and inefficient compared to the west. People did not lament that the domestic Trabant production stopped, because they knew it was not competitive or sustainable in an undistorted economy (it was an undesirable car even by their standards).

I have until today never heard the argument ""the euro is too hard to east germany / east europe"". I do hear the argument that the east needs the investment in infrastructure (and human capital) to modernise, become more competitive globally and improve living standards.",null,0,null,1436736195,null,0,false,0,ct1100y,null,t3_3d0n44,null,t1_ct1100y,null,t1_ct0vjyh,null,null,null,1437801814,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

No, it's not. In fact, in most legislatives what will be published initially will be drafts introduced into committee, that are often substantially reworked multiple times before they even go to the floor of whatever legislative. In many systems - such as e.g. most bicameral legislatives - you will then often get competing versions entered into the public record in each chamber that needs to be resolved before the act can be finally approved.

Further, in many countries it is common for draft versions to be explicitly sent out for public consultation - both available to the public in general as well as specifically soliciting input from e.g. business or organisations with competence on the specific area. Often such consultations leads to substantial revisions.

(EDIT: [Here is, for example, the UK governments page about draft bills](http://www.parliament.uk/business/bills-and-legislation/draft-bills/) - these drafts are generally made available for a period of public consultation *before* being formally introduced to the committee stages in parliament)

The release of early drafts is the standard modus operandi for most legislatives outside of dictatorships, not least because this is often a large part of the process used by legislators to obtain input and support to shape their campaigns to ensure there is support both in the public and the legislative.

Because Greek democracy is about saving the country these days, while Finnish democracy, if True Finns are a representative of that (I doubt that tbh.), is simply about being dicks who threw a hissy fit over money their tax payers involuntarily pay without Greece asking them to do so.

significantly strengthen the Greek	 administration,	 and to put in place	 a	
programme,	 under the auspices of the European	 Commission,	 for
capacity-building and de-politicizing the Greek	 administration.	 A	 first

I'm not entirely sure that's the case, at least directly. Corporation taxes are, after all, a tax on profits, which is the remainder after costs.

If it were easy to 'pass on' the bite taken by corporation tax, it would be easy to simply ramp profits up anyway. If that were the case, there would clearly be an opportunity for a competitor to undercut you, or alternatively there would appear to be no barrier to simply raising profits ad infinitum.

What a profit tax does do is lower the attractiveness of entry to a given market, either by external companies or by new companies - but that only matters where the barriers to entry aren't otherwise high anyway.

&gt; who was it?

I never really understood this idea that somehow, Greece can be entirely blamed for the current debt sustainability crisis. Certainly, the actions of previous governments play a part, but you have to keep in mind that Greece have followed the structural adjustment program as mandated by the Troika for the past five to six years.

Despite this, Greece has still not met the models set by the Troika. On the contrary, [conditions have worsened due to the austerity policies carried out by the New Democracy government:](http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/paul-krugman-syriza-should-ignore-calls-to-be-responsible-1.2080112)

&gt;The economic projections that accompanied the standby arrangement assumed that Greece could impose harsh austerity with little effect on growth and employment. Greece was in recession when the deal was reached, but the projections assumed this downturn would end soon – that there would be only a small contraction in 2011, and that, by 2012, Greece would be recovering. Unemployment, the projections conceded, would rise substantially, from 9.4 per cent in 2009 to almost 15 per cent in 2012, but would then begin coming down fairly quickly.

&gt;What actually transpired was an economic and human nightmare. Far from ending in 2011, the Greek recession gathered momentum. Greece didn’t hit the bottom until 2014 and, by that point, it had experienced a full-fledged depression, with overall unemployment rising to 28 per cent and youth unemployment rising to almost 60 per cent. And the recovery now under way is barely visible, offering no prospect of pre-crisis living standards.

Pegging the Drachma to a solid currency would be counterproductive (if possible at all), because Greece would want to devalue its currency, especially relative to the Euro, in order to boost exports.

But regardless of the desirability of having its own currency, Greece would likely issue a new currency after exiting the Eurozone simply because it would have no other choice. First of all, the government would have no Euros with which to pay its 600,000 employees, so it would be forced to issue, at the least, IOUs, which would quickly become a parallel currency to the Euro. Second of all, the banks would need reserves, and the government would be unable to recapitalize them with Euros, simply because the Greek government has basically zero Euros in reserve and is unable to borrow. So in order to prevent a bank collapse, the Greek government would have to recapitalize the banks with some sort of government-issued scrip. The banks would convert their depositors' accounts into this scrip, which would quickly become the currency of the nation. In other words, multiple exigencies would force the creation of a new Greek currency.

&gt;The US has done better than the EU in this crisis because their union is not being run by incompetent Germans.

With regard to Greece.  There were two recipes on the table: Austerity and Stimulus.  The difference is in the ingredients.   The US used stimulus in several ways to get out of the economic downturn.

* Increased defense spending - Tanks, jets, ships and the like all require lots of workers.  We bought extra stuff we didn't even need for defense.

* Automotive consumer stimulus ""Cash for Clunkers"" - This was a program that you traded in your old fuel inefficient car (to be destroyed) and got several thousand dollars given direct to consumer rebates for the purchase of new automobiles.  The stagnating automotive inventories were cleaned out meaning automotive companies had to ramp up production of new cars, meaning more jobs retained/created and more cash injecting into the consumer economy in the form of worker salaries.  Additionally a gap was created in the secondary car market because there were lots of cars intentionally destroyed that would have been ""used car"" sales.  This too meant more new cars were purchased.

* ""Shovel ready infrastructure"" projects - That new bridge or highway that had all the plans done, just no money?  Build it!  The government pays.  Our aging infrastructure got an update to support commerce for decades and more workers were put back to work, again cash injection in consumer salaries.

* Government hiring - many new positions were created and hiring freezes were lifted to employ Americans.

* and many more....

Tell me which of these Greece could do to achieve the same result?  Public spending was already huge going into the crisis.  ~~There was no one left to hire when nearly 50% of the workforce is a government worker,~~  [""But public sector workers outnumber their private counterparts to a greater extent than any other EU country."" direct quote](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greece-wants-to-cut-its-public-sector-this-man-wants-to-quit-as-a-teacher-so-why-did-it-take-two-years-8599762.html)

 and many not producing anything of economic value, but merely supporting the bureaucracy.  

Stimulus was the right choice for the US, and could have been for other parts of the EU, but I don't see what it would have fixed in Greece.  I'm open to the discussion of the ideas, however.  What am I missing?

null,false,TomShoe,null,null,null,"Syriza's election was the result of a greek populous that was understandably tired of austerity and stagnation, and that didn't like having it's country run from Brussels. It was a reaction to ND and PASOK running the country into the ground for three decades. There's no question that Syriza has complicated the issues of debt repayment but you have to remember that while the previous governments may have been far more willing to acquiesce to the wishes of their European counterparts, they were by and large the same people responsible for this mess in the first place. They may have been willing to play ball with regard to debt repayment and austerity, but necessary reforms to the greece economy were never going to happen under them. And even with their willingness to cooperate on the debt issue, there was no way they were ever going to successfully pay of their debt when they could barely manage a surplus less than half the size of the one they'd need to pay back their debts. 

The main priority of the greek government and the greek people is not, and should not be the repayment of their debt, it should be providing for the welfare of Greece, but realistically speaking those goals aren't even directly in conflict. If the EU was willing to agree to policies that would allow Greece to grow at a more reasonable pace, they'd actually have a better chance of seeing their debts repaid eventually, but this isn't about economics anymore, it's about politics, and it's far bigger than Greece.

Generell würde ich sagen: Die neuen Bundesländer haben kulturell deutlich mehr von den alten Bundesländern übernommen, als umgekehrt. Inwieweit noch ""Ostmentalitäten"" vorhanden sind, hängt oft vor allem von zwei Faktoren ab: dem Alter (präziser gesagt: ob jemand in der DDR aufgewachsen ist und dort gelebt hat, oder seine Sozialisation erst nach der Wende erfahren hat), und ob jemand aus der Großstadt oder vom platten Land kommt.

Ich selber wohne in einer Großstadt und habe beruflich überwiegend mit Menschen im Alter von zwanzig bis vierzig zu tun. In diesem Umfeld fallen die Mentalitätsunterschiede ziemlich gering aus - ähnlich wie in Westdeutschland identifiziert man sich vor allem mit seiner Heimatregion, und weniger mit politischen Systemen. Als Altenpfleger irgendwo im tiefsten Brandenburg würde ich da aber möglicherweise andere Erfahrungen machen. Wer weiß!

Insgesamt erlebe ich die Ostdeutschen als konsumkritischer, es gilt als normaler, Kinder schon in einem recht frühen Alter in die Krippe zu geben und als Mutter wieder arbeiten zu gehen (wobei der Westen hier allmählich nachzieht), und auch der Umgang mit Nacktbaden, gemischten Saunen etc. ist entspannter (ein Klischee, aber ein wahres). Was die kollektivistischen bzw. individualistischen Mentalitäten angeht, merke ich persönlich im Alltag wenig Unterschiede.

Was die Gleichberechtigung betrifft: Meine Schwiegermutter sagt immer, Frauen in der DDR durften/sollten genauso arbeiten gehen wie die Männer, den Haushalt mussten sie aber trotzdem alleine machen. Inwieweit das allgemein zutraf, weiß ich natürlich nicht.

Greece should have implemented reforms that would drastically cut public spending and help the private productive sector to floorish.

The previous goverments did very litle of the above and prefered mostly to tax the shit out of the private sector.And SYRIZA did worst by rehiring the public servants that were laid off.

&gt;Because who cares about the rule of law or human rights, when money is at stake.

What about the human rights of the people of Europe that lend Greece money?

Oh and quit the cheap philosophy with me.You want money get your ass to work.Greece has no right to demand free money from anyone.

Yes, in real terms. But it's not immediately obvious why they have lost.

Whether or not someone feels like they benefit is a relative matter. Relative to the other people around them. The person who doesn't pay taxes on his new home benefits compared to the person who does pay taxes. The person who cheats to get government subsidies that they shouldn't get benefits compared to the person who doesn't.

The policeman who takes bribes to give someone preferential treatment benefits compared to the honest policeman (on the expense of people who won't give bribes)

&gt;Germany is playing super hardline now and threatens with grexit after greece accepted to take hard measures.



It's fair to say speaking generally that the German society is royally pissed off more than ever by the reaction it received from Greece, irrespective of whether it was deserved, it's not diplomatically sound to negotiate on such stances.


&gt;Greece is being pushed in a corner, says no to the harsh measures.



Greece pushed itself in a corner &amp; kept pushing itself further with the Greferendum.



&gt;Germany is against the fronts and have to do concessions on the hard lines.



Not much is dependant is on Germany alone albeit it's influence, so term if an agreement is reached, it will beyond any shadow of a doubt have an amount of flexibility.


&gt;Greece feels like it got something out of it and Tsipras goes back as someone who at least could negotiate himself out of Germany's humiliating plans.



I feel this is the reverse at least for the time being, Tsipras may be feeling he got something out of it &amp; trying to convince the Greek people they have as well, after voting for the opposite in the Greferendum.

null,false,maryfamilyresearch,null,null,null,"I lived in the area for a while. The climate there is similar to North East England. In summer it can get relatively warm, during July/August temps oscillate around 20-35 degrees C or 70-95 F with varying humidity, but mostly dry. 

Winter will feel very cold to you, but it is still relatively mild compared to winter in NorthEast USA. IMO the worst time of the year is November. Cold, damp, wet, dark, chilly, depressing. Too warm for proper winter clothes, too cold for summer clothes and the damp air chills you to the bone. Blegh. 

In winter (Jan-Feb) expect temps to go down to minus 10 C or 14F during the day. Bring any long-sleeved t-shirts and full length jeans you might have and then buy a decent winter jacket, decent winter boots and a few nice sweaters in Germany. 

Luggage - bring less crap and more money. Don't go out and buy lots of stuff for your trip. Wait until you are in Germany and see whether you really need it, then buy it locally. 

Most people from the USA have the tendency to bring everything but the kitchen sink. They bring more on a 5 day trip to Europe than their ancestors had with them when they emigrated for life to the USA. You can spot somebody from the USA from a mile away by the size of their luggage.

Considering the size of suitcases people from the USA tend to take, I think you are best off with only one suitcase and one carry-on bag. Try to mix and match your clothes. This is best done if everything is colour-coordinated. Again, don't buy new clothes in the USA. The style is different and you'll stick out. The one thing that might be sensible to buy in the USA is new Levis jeans if you like to wear them and maybe a laptop/phone. Do your research though. 

Don't bring electronics unless they got a converter for them that takes 220V, 50Hz. I would not bring a hairdryer, sandwhichmaker, mixer or other such crap.

Greek are still human beings, and being within the EU and eurozone, it is politically more feasible to support them than say, poorer nations in Central America.

As a Finn I'd support restructuring of the EU to include wealth distribution like in the US, so yea, I'd be okay with richer countries helping poorer countries to get on their feet. Like I'm not against that the capital region of Finland economically supports the poorer regions of Finland.

The current crisis just highlights that the current structure of the EU is a failure. If we allow the EU to push Greece into more austerity causing more humanitarian trouble for the sake of some economic ideology, it merely shows that the current EU isn't really as interested in human well being and human rights as it claims.

This undermines the entire purpose of the EU and makes the entire EU much weaker. The motto of EU is ""united in diversity"" but the current situation is more like ""divided in diversity"", where different countries just think about themselves without any bit of united solidarity, wich was supposed to be the core of EU and the purpose of EU. To unite Europe so that there would be no more humanitarian catastrophes like war. But now the troika is willing to let the humanitarian situation of Greece to crumble for the sake of economic ideology.

Le leveling est rapide sur GW2, mais n'est pas inintéressant, au contraire. Et la plupart du contenu est viable pour te faire augmenter (pve, story, crafting, WvW).

TESO n'a pas un leveling intéressant, une fois atteint le rang VR1. En fait, la plupart des joueurs de TESO sont d'accord sur le fait que c'est un de ses plus gros défauts, faisant fuir les nouveaux joueurs une fois que ceux-ci ont atteint VR1 et réalisent l'énorme grind qui les attend.

&gt;Pas randonnée simulator comme GW2.

TESO est un themepark au même titre que GW2. En quoi les quêtes sur TESO sont supérieures ? D'une part, ce sont les typiques ""tue x mobs"", ""collecte x objets"" ou ""appuie sur un switch sans réfléchir car il est indiqué par une grosse icône"". D'autre part il faut faire des vas et viens incessants du NPC pour activer la quête, vers le lieu où se déroule celle-ci, pour enfin retourner voir le NPC et la valider. Le système de coeurs sur GW2 est beaucoup moins chiant, pas de vas et viens et tu as une liberté dans les objectifs qui te permettront de les compléter. L'interaction avec le décor est aussi bien meilleure.

D'autre part, le monde est beaucoup plus vivant sur GW2, car avec le downscaling et les events dynamiques, tu as une raison de revisiter les zones précédentes. TESO est un themepark au sens le plus stricte du terme, et tu n'auras jamais aucun intérêt de revisiter les zones de bas niveau. Pire, avec la façon dont ils ont divisé les 3 zones par faction, et par rang VR, la majeure partie du contenu devient à terme obsolète (et vide de joueurs). Toutes les zones de GW2 sont très peuplées, il y a un afflux constant de joueurs, nouveaux, rerolls, haut niveaux etc.

Le jeu a beaucoup évolué depuis 2013, et même si il est loin d'être parfait, je trouve que c'est un des MMO récents les plus aboutis.

Pour le char design, c'est subjectif, je te l'accorde, mais perso je trouve la posture, les animations, les coupes de cheveux extrêmement bizarres sur TESO. Les couleurs sont fades. C'est beaucoup plus vibrant sur GW2. Après ça ne sert à rien de débattre sur des goûts personnels, je conseille à OP de regarder par lui même des vidéos ou screenshots et de se forger son propre avis.

Those values and principles are at issue in the current crisis. This crisis isn't just about money and politics, it's also about justice and fairness. There are different views on this issue within Europe. A majority seems to believe that Greece must bear most of the costs for its misdeeds. There is also a vocal minority who disagrees.

&gt;Also ja, wegen genau solcher Geschichten sollte man sich nicht zu sehr auf einen bestimmten Bereich einschießen, am Ende sieht es oft ganz anders aus.

Kannst Du eigentlich was anderes außer pars pro toto? So langsam zweifel Ich daran.

&gt;Du konntest also genau **ein** konkretes Beispiel für einen Angriff von rechts bringen.

Glaubst Du Dir eigentlich selber, dass es da nix gibt, nur weil Ich in meinem low-effort-post nur zwei Beispiele anführte? Ich dachte die ganze Zeit Du wärst verblendet aber irgendwie doch kritisch. Scheiße, Du bist aber kein bisschen kritisch! Du bist einfach nur super voreingenommen und naiv ='D

&gt;Ansonsten nur eine aufgepumpte Statistik, die überwiegend auf Vermutungen basiert, wie offen zugegeben wird. Aber hey, die armen Asylbewerber werden das wohl kaum selbst machen.

&gt;Hoppla, scheint so, als würden es doch tun.

Ach, die alte Leier schon wieder. Dir kann man dutzende Beispiele und Analysen für strukturelle Probleme mit Ausländerfeindlichkeit geben. Im Zweifel sind dann doch alle Hakenkreuze von Asylanten selber gemalt und Heime von Versicherungsbetrügern oder Flüchtlingen selber angezündet. Bei der pars pro toto Argumentation mit den selbst gemalten Hakenkreuzen hattest Du bisher... 1 Artikel, den Du immer wieder postest. Das ist aber viel! Natürlich ist das die fehlende Lösung der Straftaten auf die tausende Polizeibeamte und unschuldige, mitbewohnende Augenzeugen gewartet haben! Wie konnten alle Ermittler der BRD so versagen und das all die Jahre übersehen?

Ach, wie einfach die Welt aber auch ist :D

Du weißt doch ganz genau wie die Sache aussieht, wenn wir uns sogar schon zu 50/50 entgegenkommen. Wir hätten immer noch mehrere Übergriffe monatlich (aktuell wohl ca. 10). Akzeptier es doch endlich.

Turk Stream is 100x mroe economical than SOuth Stream since Turkey is the #2 consumer next to Germany. Building a pipeline directly to Turkey insures a very stable and profitable flow. 

Building a pipeline from Russia to Bulgaria and Russia to Turkey would cost about the same. The issue comes with bridging that pipeline to the real $$$, Bulgaria consumes extremely little gas, as well as ROmania and other Balkan countries, the real money is to connect with Austrian network of pipelines which go through-out Western Europe. 

To build the pipeline from Bulgaria to Austria was estimated to be around 20-40 billion Euros, possibly more. 

To build the pipeline from Turkish-Greek border to Italy will cost 2 billion Euros. Italy is connected to Austria already so that is the goal. 

SOuth-Stream total cost = 20-40+ billion euros and only guaranteed money once it reaches Austria

TurkStream+Greek Stream = 10 billion EUros and guaranteed money immediately once it flows through Turkey

To be clear economic affairs is responsible for jobs and economy, [something that has went terribly wrong way during last](https://tilastokeskus.fi/til/tyti/2015//05/tyti_2015_05_2015-06-24_tie_001_fi.html) governments tenure and [something the entire EU has been terrible in as well](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/9/9a/Unemployment_rates_EU-28_EA-19_US_and_Japan_seasonally_adjusted_January_2000_May_2015.png).

He's two things as a commissioner were the enlargement procedures 2004-2010 and the economy 2010-2014. He has however admitted that there were mistakes made in relation to Eurocrisis, but said they are due to the fact that EU does not have tools to improve them, and that the EU had to work with what it had. I sympathize with him a bit, but for a man with a hammer, every problem seems like a nail. The commission never says and never will say ""we need less EU to solve this problem"".

In a funny but unrelated episode last year when he wasn't yet a minister, he threw a fit when Finland committed to a Russia's nuclear power plant project in Finland, basically arguing that the project will jeopardize the safety of energy production and our independence from Russia. The same project is overseen by the ministry of employment and economy. So funnily now he has to defend the project against those very same claims.

Also related to the fennovoima nuclear power plant: There is a requirement in Finland that the project must have ownership of 60% from the European free trade area (eu+norway etc. you know). However the project had problems as it was unclear if it would get the ownership. Last year it was solved by Fortum, a Finnish half state owned energy company stepping in. I believe it was done since Fortum has exposure to power plants in Russia.

As the economy has been getting worse and people are getting fired, companies are pulling back their participation in projects due to lower growth expectations. A Croatian company, on paper at least, called migrit energija stepped in at some point. It's rumoured to be Russia's straw-company, a company that only exists to bypass the ownership limit. Also a dairy (milk etc.) company, Valio said they are looking to sell their ownership of the project. People asked Valio if it is a coincidence, they said it is, maybe it is not.

As an example a bit after the EU's sanctions hit, Russia turned all the dairy products away from the border, saying ""hygiene reasons"". They did not announce counter-sanctions then, but merely turned the Finnish products away and the counter sanctions came later. Maybe they have some negative experiences of working in Russia. Valio also reduced work force by up to 330 ""work-years"" as they say here. I joked back then that they can't sell cheese in Russia since they haven't produced the butter. Butter= voi. Voiteet = bribes.

HDZ government was building the same for 7.4 million Euros.

HAC and ARZ (public companies that run Croatian highways) were taking around 3 million Euros of loans during SDP government, but when HDZ came to power they were taking 14,5 million Euros of loans per built km.

Basically they say it's a very calm place. Here are a few listed touristic landmarks:


* Argonne forest : along the road of the Haute-Chevauchée, one will find numerous relics of the first world war, among which the shelters of the Kronprinz and the Kaisertunnel.


* Argonne's abbeys: Lachalade, Beaulieu, Moiremont, Montfaucon and Châtrices.


* The foundation of the Bois d'Épense (Les Islettes) and the museum of Rarécourt, both dedicated to Argonne's faience (ndr: sounds fun).


* Parc Argonne Découverte (Nocturnia), Sensations Nature in the Ardennes (wolf park...).


* Sainte-Menehould and its current gendarmerie where the King Louis XVI and his family rested in their attempted escape, before they were spotted by Jean Baptiste Drouet and later arrested on the 21st june 1791, in Varennes-en-Argonnes.


* Clermont-en-Argonne : the King's path


* La butte de Vauquois, notable landmark of the Mines war (1914 - 1918)


* Medieval landmarks of the XIth and XIIth centuries: MANRE (08), BOURQ (08), AUTRY (08), CORNAY (08)... If you wanna know more about it, you could read the following article in french."" http://centretudargonnais.org/HorizonArgonne88.pdf


* Medieval landmarks of southern Argonne : Élise-Daucourt, Dampierre-le-Château, Épense, Le-Vieil-Dampierre, Passavant, Beaulieu.



Music



* Since 1994 the village of Louvergny welcomes a festival of lyrical and original music named ""Les Rencontres de Louvergny"". It takes place during the first fortnight of august. Concerts are organized everywhere in Argonne.


Food specialities


* The ""Mollet Cake"" or in french gâteau Mollet.

null,false,Rarehero,EURO,European Union,null,"&gt; To people in support of a third bail out of up to 100 billion euros: Do you really believe that a Greek government, especially this government, will not only enact but actually enforce any of the fiscal responsibility measures they've agreed to this to week?

No, which is why I'd prefer a programme where the money is split into small charges and only paid for reforms that were ratified and are being implemented. And while I absolutely don't want to touch the sovereignty of the Greek nation, it probably would be super helpful for the entire process if Greece would request and accept the assistance of Eurozone technocrats for implementing the reforms and finally building the structures the country needs to get the tax collection thing running. That would really strengthen the work relationship between both sides. Of course these technocrats would have to come from a country the Greek governments, which would be France and Italy I guess and certainly not Germany or the Netherlands at the moment.

Keep in mind that the bailout money is not paid upfront. It's not as if the Eurozone just transfers 86 billion Euros to Greece and hopes that the Greek government will keep their promises. That money is just guaranteed and only paid when certain benchmarks are achieved. The problem in the past was that the rules and procedures have to been to lax in respect to Greece and that the institutions have closed one and sometimes both eyes when Greece was lagging behind the set goals (which in return made the institutions only harder and less considerate in negotiations).

P.S.: What I really hate about the entire process is that all sides have made huge mistakes over the last five years, but only the Greek government and their people are held accountable for their mistakes. I really miss that sense of ""We are all in this together, we have all done our fair share of mistakes and we all have to work together as European partners to solve the mess!"".",null,0,null,1436742228,null,0,false,0,ct14aur,null,t3_3cuj5o,null,t1_ct14aur,null,t1_ct10gny,null,null,null,1440483538,null,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6,null

Poche donne nel settore? Forse si, ma non é il settore che rema contro (vedi tutti i concordi riservati esclusivamente alle donne ed agevolazioni) sono loro che preferiscono altri rami ( *cough* gender study *cough* ). In casi di accuse é prassi licenziare l'accusato, é tutta PR. Se tu lavorassi in america e ti accusassero di stupro (anche se infondato e ti dimostri innocente) ti licenziano istantaneamente per non essere chiamati ""rape apologist"". Bella l'america femminista, vero?

Punto 2:

FPH aveva diritto di esistere in quanto espressione della libertà di parola ed era pienamente legale. Non é stato chiuso per questioni morali, ma perché vogliono iniziare a monetizzare reddit, e non puoi farlo se un subreddit da 180k persone insulta il 60% dell'america.

In più la mancanza di trasparenza e comunicazione ha fatto adirare anche quelli a favore della chiusura di fph.

Ancora oggi non si hanno linee guida su ciò che é definito ""harassing"", é una cosa lasciata all'interpretazione dell'admin fino al punto in cui linkare un post in un altro subreddit può portare al tuo. ban

**The new conditions are significantly worse now in comparison to those from a 2 weeks ago because:**

* **the amount of money required is about 10 times larger**

* **Greek economy is now in a way worse shape with strongly negative prospects = new expensive bailout could be needed soon**

* **nobody trusts Syriza**

The conditions from ~2 weeks ago for for about 15 billion € of funding that would mostly go towards repayments of debts falling due (AKA debt restructuring with loans that have to be repaid much later) and the covering of Greek budgetary deficit until the winter. The majority of the demands were already agreed on in exchange for money in the previous bailouts, but were either never implemented or rolled back after Syriza gained power.

What is being discussed now is much harsher for two reasons:

* This is a completely new bailout programme, third one at that. The amount of money discussed is just below 100 billion € and that excludes the dozens of billions ECB would need to provide to the broke Greek banks in the days after the deal is reached. This is a magnitude larger amount of money than what was discussed as a part of the second bailout and everybody made it clear that the third bailout will have much stricter conditions, if it's required, weeks ago.

* The Greek sabotaging of negotiations in the last months, return to a deep primary deficit after rolling back reforms and the failure to reach a deal which resulted in capital limits severely damaged the Greek economy and exposed the imminent failure of their whole banking sector. This set back all economic goals severely and caused Greece to require significantly more money to survive after being bailed out twice already, with significantly higher probability that the goals will not be reached and the default crisis will appear again, with another bailout required.

* Even after 2 bailouts, reforms already promised, which you can find in the documents and reports named something like ""2010 pension reform"" or ""2012 pension/tax reform"" are still not in place. It is clear that even previous more ""cooperative"" governments had massive problems with actually following through with was was agreed on after they received their money. Therefore trust and competence were already pressing matters in the past. Syriza just amplified that by basically being voted into power by promising that it will tell troika to fuck off and one of their first actions was the removal of all troika advising personnel from all Greek institutions and a roll back or freeze of plenty of the reforms. They even abandoned the negotiations for more financial assistance and scheduled a referendum where they actively campaigned against the creditor's proposal. Just a few days later the PM seems to have magically changed his mind and is now offering to accept the proposal that was previously completely unacceptable, while members of his party are publicly stating that they will fight the Eurozone again, when the situation is more appropriate. It's not very hard to see why other countries would be suspicious of his intentions and the value of his promises, especially with the low support to spend more on Greece among their citizens and increasingly bleak prospects from economists.

I don't think the direction the negotiations are going in right now is appropriate, but it definitely helps to understand it if you also look at the other side, not just the Greek one.",null,0,null,1436742412,null,0,false,0,ct14e9k,null,t3_3d1ooe,null,t1_ct14e9k,null,t1_ct0zbv9,null,null,null,1437804439,null,91,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,91,null

HAHAH. OK. So what are you saying then? Because politically, it is neither a necessity, nor an option to institute transfer  payments if you cannot control the spending. That would be like every state in the US deciding how much of the federal budget it would like to spend.

There are many examples of currency unions and quasi unions without transfer payments. Current and present.

The cities around Paris all organize their fireworks on the 13^th but I don’t know which ones are best and where to watch them from.

If you intend to go to the military parade or the concert/fireworks at the Eiffel Tower, check the [press releases of the Prefecture de police](http://www.prefecturedepolice.interieur.gouv.fr/Nous-connaitre/Salle-de-presse/Communiques-de-presse/Manifestations) to know which metro stations are closed.

The fireworks are fired from the Trocadéro gardens, the place de Varsovie, the pont d’Iéna and the Eiffel Tower itself, so if you want a good up-close view without going to the Champ de Mars itself (there are security checks and it’ll be packed long in advance), the bridges and the banks of the Seine near the Tower are a good place that’s not packed too early. The press releases don’t say clearly which area will be forbidden to pedestrians unfortunately. The Passerelle Debilly (north of the Eiffel tower) will be closed because it could not stand the weight of hundreds of people. Last year access to the Pont de Bir-Hakeim (south of the Eiffel tower) was completely forbidden but usually it’s open (but the banks are closed up to that bridge on the south IIRC), the Pont de l’Alma in the north, Pont de Grenelle and Mirabeau in the south should be open.",null,0,null,1436743661,null,0,false,0,ct151q4,null,t3_3d0nf4,null,t1_ct151q4,null,t3_3d0nf4,null,null,null,1437804927,null,7,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,7,null

CAMPING: Free camping, as in pitching a tent wherever you want, is prohibited (it could be tolerated in rural and forest areas but it's certainly not allowed in urban parks, for instance). Instead there are many equipped areas for camping or even hostels that make for a cheap shelter for the night. If you feel adventurous enough, you could try and ask for hospitality into people's houses or yards. (A few years back a couple of German tourist were travelling trough Italy by bike and stopped by my grandpa's asking to spend the night in his backyard. He granted them permission but those were different times and I'm not sure you'll find many people willing to do the same today). Anyway, as before, camping areas and hostels should do.

DANGEROUS AREAS: well... If you are talking about criminality, I'd say that Italy is not Bronx but it's not such a safe place either. I don't think you should worry about someone attacking you but watch out for your personal belongings, ESPECIALLY your bike because theft is very present and bike theft even more so. Buy a good padlock and always park your bike next to a solid structure (like a lamppost) and lock it up. That said, smaller cities are quieter and safer than bigger one, in my opinion, and the northern part of Italy is more crime-free than the south. 

As for danger in the streets, you should really try to avoid the largest and more trafficked ones and travel on the smaller ones. For example you could follow the [Francigena route](http://www.viefrancigene.org/en/) that is used by pilgrims to go to Rome. Check out this site http://italy-cycling-guide.info/ as well, it provides info about cyclo-tourism.

An increase in wealth will tend to go mostly to those in a society most capable of getting their hands on it. That seems to be true no matter what society one is considering - it's almost tautological. Ergo, without deliberate correction, prosperity produces oligarchy (in the broad sense of power ending up in a few hands).

There are only two states which don't allow oligarchy - absolute poverty, and unlimited wealth. Everywhere in between, there are limited amounts of desired resources - and control of those limited resources is power. As the absolute amount of resources increases, the possible gap between rich and poor widens. At a low level, the imbalance is not enough to exclude the poor from power, at higher levels it becomes so.

If you really want diversification, you need to *integrate the banking sector*, but in such a way that you don't end up with just a few megabanks like the US (due to too big to fail). For that, you need a common regulator with country branches (not one sucky regulator per country).

2) Kill the privileges. A lot of countries have special treatment to interest groups. That's not just the case of Greece but it's true in Italy, Spain, France, etc. It's easier to kill their exemptions if you are sitting in Brussels than in Spain.

4) Kill half of the French agricultural subsidies.

Printing money in the way you mean, reduces the value of existing money. Countries with debts in Euro *will* benefit, but countries with debts in other currencies (say dollars) would suffer. Granted it won't be much given the scale, it's still not acceptable though.

I honestly don't understand why some people here on reddit seem to be concerned with Holland/Netherlands nomenclature. In my personal experience, in real-life I've only heard people from Limburg complain about this, and it seems to be some sort of way of distinguishing *them* from *Hollanders*, which is their name for people from the Randstad. From large cities in the western part of the country, not necessarily from south/north Holland, since e.g. people in Utrecht are also considered ""Hollanders"". It's some weird pet peeve where they want to distinguish themselves from a different part of the country.

Weird as that is, if they want to do that, fine. But what I don't understand is why they then bother non-Dutch people with this stuff.

Expenses were 45% of GDP, not excessive. Not to mention that the problem was tax evasion, not overtaxation.

After Tsipras accepted that condition as well, a new paper suddenly appeared suggesting that in case of failure to implement these measures Greeks would have to sell their firstborn children into slavery with the earnings going directly to loan payments. At this point an unexpected turn took place as a previously unknown equity fund , Hellisus, run by a Louis Uxbridge Cypher, expressed interest in funding greek debt. They offered a generous investment package, debt restructuring with long term possibility of a partial haircut and promised to start collecting after the lifespan of the signing parties.

Europeans vary greatly in their mentality but I guarantee you that a great variation in mentality exists within Greece as well with Crete being the champion of tax evasion. This did not interrupt our peace. Europe is the best place in the world, we show more respect for the different, for human rights and freedom of expression and we maintain peace. Throughout all those years there has been no coup or war in any EU country (and no bankruptcy either, at least not a blatant one).

All Europeans feel strange for the lack of sovereignity and so they tend to endorse politicians who villainise others. I don't pay attention to such nonsense, it is the usual populistic crap that will forever accompany democracy and freedom of speech. I have friends from Germany and elsewhere, sure we differ in mentality but heck I don't quite match the average Greek either and I find this not necessarily a bad thing. Europe progressed through variety and it should keep this. I dislike the rather uniform and colorless USA federation and I certainly dislike the huge Chinese state.

The current crisis is the first crisis that Europe faced and it coincided with the global financial crisis. Europe managed to face it adequately (remember how close Italy was from being left outside the markets during 2011) and now the Greek problem is the major stake. It is true that Greece has been devastated by 7 years of recession (and more to come) and that it is not the only country that suffers today (Portugal and Spain are not exactly happy) but it keeps going, it faces the rising economic powers adequately, it keeps peace, it has a balanced overal trade balance and by all measures it appears like an oasis in a world in turmoil.

The darkest moment of Europe was its role in the Ukraine crisis. It has had other dark moments, one of which is the current dominance of conservatives with their monotonous rhetoric about the virtues of a levelling austerity, but I see it as the efforts of a teenager who tries to become an adult. We can't stick to the stubborness of Germans for an austerity that happened to work for them (because they applied it correctly) because in the future all we now see as the permanent truth will be past. Europe has no other choice than to overcome its first crisis (although to abandon civil rights like in the case of the imposed punishment on Greece rightfully appears like a good leap backwards, but anyway I insist on being optimistic, if not for Greeks then for the rest of Europeans).",null,0,null,1436746163,null,0,false,0,ct16bn1,null,t3_3d2atc,null,t1_ct16bn1,null,t3_3d2atc,null,null,null,1437805872,null,37,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,37,null

When Syriza was elected at the beginning of the year they rolled back a number of reforms that had been bindingly agreed on in the previous bail out.

The Greek government has constantly done things to irritate Germany: asking for WW2 debt, calling people terrorists etc... and worse of all it held a surprise referendum a week ago that essentially rejected almost the same deal.

On top of this, one thing I find completely hypocritical is that when the current Greek government held their surprise referendum they defended it by claiming democratic ideals. Yet what difference is there with the German government taking a very hard line that a majority of its electorate wants?

&gt;To build the pipeline from Turkish-Greek border to Italy will cost 2 billion Euros. Italy is connected to Austria already so that is the goal. 

Nice load of bullshit, which shows how incompetent you are in the matter. South stream and now Turkish stream is not intended to go through Italy, it never was. The initial plan was Bulgaria-Serbia-Hungary-Austria. The Turkish stream is supposed to go that way too except this time through Maceodnia as well, because you can not go arround that country now, when you are coming from Greece. 

&gt;SOuth-Stream total cost = 20-40+ billion euros 

&gt;TurkStream+Greek Stream = 10 billion EUros 

Did you pull those numbers out of your ass? I clearly showed you that South stream was the shorter and more efficient project, thats why Putin wasnted it so badly. Turkish stream was a plan B. Turkish stream + ""Greek stream"" can not cost only 10 billion, because just the sea part to Turkey is more than 10 billion alone, and the Greeke part is more than 5 billion alone. I will let you do the calculation for the land part in Turkey, then the Maceodnian, Serbian, Hungarian and Austrian part. 10 billions you say? Every expert in the field estimates the Turkish stream as the more expensive project.

You need to elaborate on this one. As I already said the Blue stream that is *already* transiting gas to Turkey stays half empty all the time. How are the ""money guaraneteed"" once the new pipes flow through Turkey? Who is going to use the extra gas?

null,false,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,null,"&gt; My point, though, was that this seems to be a case where ISDS was successfully used by a company where there was no discrimination against them due to their being foreign. It doesn't fit within your definition.

The definition isn't quite ""get discriminated against for being foreign"", but more ""be subject to material losses as a result of a purely political decision that went against reasonable expectations and unable to get any recourse through the domestic courts"".

That's a bit long-winded, so I'll use the Vattenfall 1 case (the one they won).

1. Vattenfall were encouraged by the city government to expand their original plans for a modest power plant into a much bigger one.

2. They applied for, were granted, and complied with 'preliminary permits' that allowed them to start work, pending the final permits which they were assured would be in line with the preliminary permits. The permits were regarded by the licensing agency as entirely sufficient to protect the local environment. This is the 'reasonable expectation'.

3. The city government changed after an election, and a new head was appointed to the licensing agency involved. Unlike Anglosphere countries, senior civil servants in Germany are often also politicians - this one was a local Senator.

4. The licensing agency then issued final permits which were entirely out of line with what the whole project had been based on, sufficient to prevent any construction of a plant. The decision wasn't based on any new data, or new regulations/laws Hamburg was required to observe, but was done for electoral popularity. This is the 'purely political decision'.

5. At this stage, Vattenfall had committed to the works, hired contractors and plant, etc. The new permits meant all that had to simply stop, with Vattenfall footing the bill. This is the 'material losses'.

6. Vattenfall sought redress both at the local and national level - either a reversion to the originally agreed permits, or compensation for their costs. This was stonewalled both locally and at the national level (same party at both levels). This is the 'no redress through domestic channels'.

7. That led Vattenfall to take a case through the ISDS mechanism under the Energy Charter, and win.

The vital points here, really, are (a) that the decision to block the power plant by way of the permits was nakedly political - the existing permits had already been agreed as sufficient to protect the local environment, there were no new obligations the city government was under, there was no reason for the decision but electoral popularity; (b) that Vattenfall had suffered material losses as a result of going ahead on the basis of being assured it could do so by the city government under one set of politicians, then having the rug pulled by the next set; and (c) that Vattenfall was stonewalled when it came to any kind of redress.

It's probable that a German company would not have been stonewalled the same way - at the very least dicking a domestic company around like that is going to be bad publicity somewhere you care about. A foreign company has no natural allies, so they're an easy target. 

However, the main point is that Vattenfall were hugely and expensively dicked about for the sake of one person's political career, and couldn't get anyone to even consider their side of the story. It's perfectly possible to say ""well, that's the way it goes, caveat contractor"", but it's equally possible to point out that it's a very bad way for it to go. 

I don't have any objection to the idea that the Senator who moved up to head the licensing agency had the right to pull the plug on the project, but I do object to the idea that he can do so at huge cost to someone else who was involved in good faith, and not have to even listen to them, never mind compensate them. That's across the line from 'responsive' government to arbitrary government.

Most other ISDS cases where companies have been successful (a minority) have been similar in character to this one. The Veolia case in Egypt, for example, related to a contract between Veolia and the government for an experimental power-from-waste project Veolia were running at cost for Egypt - because it was running at cost, Veolia's contract contained a stipulation that if costs rose, what Veolia charged would rise. When the Egyptian government raised the minimum wage, it raised Veolia's costs, but the Egyptian government preferred not to pay.",null,0,null,1436749581,null,0,1436750825,0,ct184cs,null,t3_3d0ftu,null,t1_ct184cs,null,t1_ct0xzxj,null,null,null,1437807226,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

It was later, when I was applying for arraigo and residency at the comisaria in Spain that I had to get the apostilled FBI report. When it's a state document, the state does the apostille.

I have a revolutionary idea, something nobody heard of before! Hold on, you're going to love this, but I'm afraid it's a bit too groundbreaking as an innovation.

Let's say we could, like, not pay 85000000000 Euros immediately. Let's say we could, instead, divide it into several payments. We'd call it, I dunno... ""tranches"" maybe. And we'd pay them at given times in exchange for given reforms. We could even hold the payments until some reforms are done and eventually decide not to pay if we are not satisfied with Greece. For example, if they were, say, to expect ~7 Billions Euros at a given time (like, say, june 2015 to pay back an IMF loan among other things), but we were not satisfied with the current state of the Greek state, we could refuse to unlock the tranche...

That's definitely a pioneering idea I know, so maybe nobody ever thought about it before. But I'm sure we could give it a try... I even have a name for this. We'd call such an agreement a Memorandum. Damn I'm a genius! No wonder Schaüble has never heard of it before, it's just so innovative...

1. Our debt is in euros. After the first bailout we lost the ability to peg the debt to another currency. Transitioning to a new drachma won't solve our debt problem.

2. Halted imports. Till the new currency stabilizes, no one would risk exporting to Greece. As Greece is a large importer, we would have huge shortage of basic foodstuffs, medicines etc. Which brings us to

3. Black market. Due to shortages a black market will be unavoidable. They'll use euro as their proffered currency and the shadow economy would gain huge boost. Which of course means apart from the huge social inequalities (people with euros getting stuff that people with drachma can't) it would also mean less money from VAT.

So we'll have shortages of basic stuff, social unrest and the debt won't be smaller. Granted we'd probably default, which would mean no access to markets for some time, which means growth would have to be limited to printing more money, which means an already devalued currency would need to be devalued more and more.

&gt; In Order to form the basis for successful conclusion of the MoU, the Greek offer of reform measure needs to be seriously strenghtened to take into account...

\&gt; Is it me or it means ""Greece will have to sign whatever additionnal demands is required of them, without even knowning yet what it is going to be"" ? That's the reforms greece must pass to even have a right to negociate staying in the Eurozone ? A surrender without knowing the terms ? :/

So, okay let's stay calm for a minute and not panick, i guess they want greece to enforce part of the last austerity proposals as good will before having a right to negociate the rest or any garantees that the troika will actually loan them 85B. Seems reasonable enough.

&gt; finally, to amend or compensate for roll-back legislation adopted during 2015, which have not been agreed with the institutions and run counter to the commitements agreed in the framework of hte 20 February 2015 Eurogroup statement.

Yeah basically they want Syriza to surrender their sovereignty and power to pass any laws and suspend ANY AND ALL internal spendings that haven't been validated or opposed by the troika. And revocate the entire political program that got them elected in the first place, and therefore ignore entirely openly the full democratic will of the Greek citizens. Sorry but i have a feeling that's going to cause ""a bit"" of unrest if that happen.

&gt;The Eurogroup takes note of the possible programme financing needs of between EUR 82 and 86bn, as assessed by the institutions. The Eurogroup invites the institution to explore possibilities to reduce the financing envelope.

Are they really living the same situation ? It's not 80 Bn that greece need, it's a lot more. Let alone the 300Bn debt too, before the hair cut. Granted there's to be an investment program simultaneously, but if you tell the greeks they won't even get the whole bailout money and will have to cut on it too, what's even the point of the concessions or announce those numbers for the bailout ?!??

&gt; The greek authorities reiterate their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and timely

Sooo neither the whole bailout, nor an haircut nor any moratorium on the debts ? Again, what's the point of the negociations in that case ? What do they even get ?

It can't possibly be serious, they just want to kick greece out and make more and more impossible demands disguised as negociations to force it down.

&gt; In case no agreement could be reached, Greece should be offered swift negociations on a time-out from the euro area, with possible debt restructuring.

There, this passage is basically an admission to it. They don't expect greece to do such impossible commitement; nor even wants it. They openly want to push the country out of the Euro at least temporarily.

This is how Federalism works.

There is the ruling body, there are subordinates.

Every struggle for independence was because a people believed they would better rule themselves than supposed superiors.

Every domination of a nation has been because people believed they would rule others better than they could on their own.

Union and Independence are simply not possible, they are the dialectical opposites in power.

An *obligation* to a Union is *literally* a *binding* to it; ob ligare. 

Bound, shackled.
 Whatever the bunde chosen, or enforced, it is that - - there is a reduction in the degree of freedom.

Europe and its Europeans need to make peace with that and choose.

Will there be individual sovereign nations, or *not*. There's no middle ground.

Nations are polity, economy, and military - - and binding one eventually means binding the others.

There will be a Federal EU or there will be local federalizations or there will continue to be as many sovereign nations as there are now.

In the first two, certain sovereign nations cease to be anything more than culturally and ethnically and linguistically different - - they don't get to have their own nation.

In the third, no one gets the policy, bounty/poverty, or security of another people.

What the balance is will have to be chosen, but it's pretty much all or nothing.

Then again, the Articles of Confederation gave way to our Constitution, and the United States of America saw their existence as States with competing interests give way in many respects to a powerful Federal government, one which redistributes among them, and holds power over them.

Federal military bases in Texas aren't Texas National Guard. Alabama's Federal aid is coming from California. It's the Federal subsidies of the MidWest's agriculture that makes the Coast's consumer economies possible, etc.

Only Texas had a shot at being a real nation, and no State is sovereign.

But, of course, Californians have an equal say in the upper house of Federal Congress as do North Carolinians, through their Senators, and proportional say in the lower house via Representatives.

*That* kind of loss of sovereignty and binding of fates is the price for 'no taxation without representation'.

Long story short: Debts can only be cancelled or restructured with your creditors in a mutual agreement, like already happened when private creditors accepted a haircut of 65% in april 2012 for the Greek debt [that was held by private banks](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-07-07/how-greece-s-bank-bailout-benefited-greeks), or as happened with [the German debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Agreement_on_German_External_Debts) in 1953, where some of the debt was cancelled and other debt downpayments were stretched out over many decades.     
    
If the creditors refuse to negotiate a debt cancellation or restructuring, than these debts keep existing. Or you stay within the confines of how capitalism works globally, or you can drop out of the financial world system altogether, and create a parallel system such as the USSR did after the 1917 Russian revolution. Only very powerful nations can create parallel systems out of thin air. Greece is not one of those.        
    
As my first link describes, part of the Argentina debt is still being held by foreign governments, and another part was sold to vulture funds, who will keep litigating until eternity or a deal is reached. If no deal is reached with the creditors, they can in theory keep these debts hanging over the Greek state's head for centuries (yes, there have been debts that old).

ATHENS—Europe’s ultimatum to Greece, demanding full capitulation as the price of any new bailout, marks the failure of a rebellion by a small, debt-ridden country against its lenders’ austerity policies, after Germany flexed its muscles and offered Athens a choice between obeisance or destruction.

Sunday’s statement on Greece by eurozone finance ministers will go down as one of the most brutal diplomatic démarches in the history of the European Union, a bloc built to foster peace and harmony that is now publicly threatening one of its own with ruination unless it surrenders.

The weekend’s power play also highlights the cracks among Greece’s creditors—especially Germany and the International Monetary Fund—as the cost of keeping Greece in the euro spirals out of control. The IMF has urged Europe to give Greece some debt relief, something Berlin has opposed. Part of the reason for Germany’s hard line now is that maximally tough austerity in Greece could reduce IMF pressure to write off Greek loans.

The other 18 euro members were late Sunday pushing Greece to implement all of the austerity measures and broader economic overhauls its voters have twice rejected—in elections in January and in a referendum on July 5—not in return for new rescue loans, but as a precondition for even talking about them.

The Greek government of left-wing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, which has spent all year trying to challenge Europe’s bailout policies, has ended up a near-powerless pariah in Europe—even though Mr. Tsipras is politically dominant inside Greece. Its only remaining option for disobedience—to default and leave the euro—would satisfy rather than horrify many of its European critics, led by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble.

The fall of the Tsipras government under the creditors’ heavy pressure would please many European policy makers. In Berlin and other northern European capitals, officials have made little secret of their view they can’t trust Mr. Tsipras to deliver his side of a bailout deal, even if he were to sign one. But most officials know that Mr. Tsipras’s fall after only six months would raise awkward questions about the scope for democracy in an EU that presents itself as a beacon of popular sovereignty for the world.

Greece hasn’t complied with creditors’ demands yet. But its only alternative appears to be the gamble of a euro exit, which most Greeks fear would bring worse economic devastation.

In the end, the telling factor in the standoff may be that Greeks fear their country’s exit from the euro more than Germany does. That gives Berlin the stronger hand to impose its austerity-and-reforms prescription.

The demands from the so-called “Eurogroup” of finance ministers range from handing Greek public assets to a fund in Luxembourg to auction off to giving international technocrats powers to approve or veto draft laws in Athens.

“The Eurogroup is pushing Tsipras to effectively hand over the keys to the country; he may have neither the will nor the authority to do so, opting to walk out and resign instead,” Wolf Piccoli, managing director of political-risk consultancy Teneo Intelligence, wrote in a research note Sunday.

Behind Europe’s show of force lie three main factors: Fury at Mr. Tsipras’s delay tactics, shock at the rising cost of any and all Greek scenarios, and a worsening clash between German-led Europe and the IMF.

Since his election in January, Mr. Tsipras has oscillated between his hard-line and pragmatic advisers, Greek officials say. The pragmatists urged him to sign a bailout deal early, even if it meant accepting politically hard-to-sell austerity measures, because the terms of any deal would get tougher as the months passed and Greece’s economy deteriorated.

Nonsense, argued others such as now-ousted finance minister Yanis Varoufakis: Greece would get the best bailout terms, including less austerity and more debt relief, if it waited until the last moment before debt default. Europe would get scared of the destabilizing fallout from a Greek euro exit, this camp argued.

Mr. Tsipras went with the second school of thought, figuring also that his left-wing Syriza party would only swallow a bailout deal involving austerity if the alternative were imminent economic meltdown.

For months, Mr. Tsipras saw to it that Europe’s normal channels for negotiating bailout terms—the Eurogroup, and teams of EU-IMF inspectors—were paralyzed. He instead bet on face-to-face talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, believing that she would make a fundamentally political decision to keep Europe united, even at the expense of German economic orthodoxy.

It proved an epic miscalculation. Backed into a corner by Mr. Tsipras’s referendum, in which Greeks overwhelmingly rejected their creditors’ austerity demands, Ms. Merkel hardened her line. A deal with Athens that let Greece off tough economic reforms would be worse for Europe and splintering the eurozone, she argued.

Ms. Merkel’s openness to Greek euro exit—an outcome she had previously resisted as too hard to calculate or control—has allowed her finance chief, Mr. Schäuble, free rein. Long convinced that Greek politicians simply aren’t up to running their country well enough to be a euro member, Mr. Schäuble stunned Greece on Saturday by proposing that the country take a five-year “timeout” from the common currency.

Official Europe, it appears—at least this weekend—can play chicken better than Mr. Tsipras. Germany, once provoked, has proved more willing than Mr. Tsipras expected to contemplate a Greek euro exit, or “Grexit.” That makes the eurozone’s German-inspired ultimatum more credible than Syriza’s implicit threat of euro exit—which Mr. Tsipras knows his nation overwhelmingly fears.

Yet the weekend’s unequal test of strength in Brussels can’t be counted as a simple victory for Germany and its eurozone allies. Ms. Merkel wanted to lend Greece money while it overhauled itself, and to get the money back in a reasonable time. Now the cost of keeping Greece afloat in the euro is reaching a multiple of what Ms. Merkel originally expected. Not only does Greece need as much as €86 billion more in financing, but the European part of the roughly €216 billion in funding that Greece has received so far needs restructuring.

Regardless of whether the German stance prevails, Ms. Merkel also faces one of the deepest political crises of her decadelong tenure. Her coalition partner, the left-of-center Social Democrats, has criticized her for being prepared to kick Greece out of the euro. Meanwhile, many of her conservatives are balking at any further aid for Greece at all.

How much restructuring is the subject of tug of war between the IMF and German-led Europe. The IMF insists that comprehensive debt relief is needed to make Greece solvent again, such is the damage that the recent weeks’ events have done to the country’s economy and banking system. The Germans insist outright debt forgiveness is unacceptable to them and illegal among EU nations.

The IMF says that the less debt relief Greece gets from Europe, the harsher the terms of Greece’s overhauls-and-austerity program have to be. Greek taxpayers have to carry the full cost of repairing the country’s solvency if Germany and the rest of the eurozone won’t. Ms. Merkel needs to keep the IMF on board to sell further aid for Greece to her increasingly skeptical parliament. That—as well as her finance minister’s anger at Greek politicians—is why the chancellor is now tightening the screws on Mr. Tsipras.",null,0,null,1436752428,null,0,false,0,ct19lor,null,t3_3d2r7g,null,t1_ct19lor,null,t3_3d2r7g,null,null,null,1437808380,null,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8,null

It's too late for that. If they do nothing, confidence in the EU will evaporate because it will be clear that the standards individual nations are held to don't matter. If they kick Greece out, confidence will evaporate because it will be clear that the commitments EU nations make to one another mean nothing. This whole crisis has seriously compromised the European project, and it will take time and reform to see that confidence return.

The idea of the EU was cooperation between nations for the benefit of all — It was never meant to be some elite club for the rich nations, and to change that now would be to abandon the ideals on which the EU was founded. Maybe those ideas are beyond hope anyway, but a Grexit certainly won't help the situation.

Edit: It's also worth mentioning that this same thing happens in the US. It's not like every state pulls it's weight. Californians tend to pay more in federal taxes than their state gets back in federal spending, whereas Alabama tends to get more in the way of federal spending than it's taxpayers contribute. It's been that way since the beginning and everyone is fine with it. Granted it's not nearly as extreme given the similarities of the economies and cultures, and the more limited influence of state governments, but the principle is there.

Non mais moi jte parle juste de faire les quêtes des trois factions, fuck le reste. Ca a de quoi occuper un moment.

&gt; TESO est un themepark au même titre que GW2. En quoi les quêtes sur TESO sont supérieures ? D'une part, ce sont les typiques ""tue x mobs"", ""collecte x objets"" ou ""appuie sur un switch sans réfléchir car il est indiqué par une grosse icône"". D'autre part il faut faire des vas et viens incessants du NPC pour activer la quête, vers le lieu où se déroule celle-ci, pour enfin retourner voir le NPC et la valider. Le système de coeurs sur GW2 est beaucoup moins chiant, pas de vas et viens et tu as une liberté dans les objectifs qui te permettront de les compléter. L'interaction avec le décor est aussi bien meilleure.

Ben les quêtes de TESO sont supérieures parce que c'est des quêtes, tout simplement. Et de très bonnes pour un MMO par ailleurs. Le bashing et le fedex sont très bien gérées imo. J'ai rarement eu à buter plus de 5 mobs pour une quête, et pour les aller retours, la plupart du temps c'est le PNJ qui vient à ta rencontre. Elles sont entièrement doublées également. Pour une fois j'ai pas eu envie de rusher, façon WoW, le leveling.

Sinon le système de cœur de GW2, moins chiant ? AHAHAHAHAH c'est la meilleure de l'année ! Tu te contentes juste de faire la même action en boucle jusqu'à ce que ton cœur soit rempli, du genre basher des mobs en boucle, ou arroser des plantes, ou capturer des bestioles. Ensuite de l'interaction avec le décor ? Ah tu veux dire les quelques râteliers d'armes que tu peux tabasser. Génial. Au moins dans TESO tu peux tout chourer. Et GW2 pour moi c'est randonnée simulator parce qu'une fois que t'as rempli tes coeurs et que t'es complétement underlevel, faut que tu crapahutes sur toute la map pour trouver des events ultra scriptés et uber répétitifs histoire de récupérer le retard de pex (monde vivant mon cul, y a aucune conséquence sur le résultat des events). Ou bien tu crapahutes jusqu'à une autre zone de même level pour faire ses coeurs. Je l'ai fait trois ou quatre fois le leveling de GW2, j'ai eu le temps de m'en dégoûter.

&gt; Pour le char design, c'est subjectif, je te l'accorde, mais perso je trouve la posture, les animations, les coupes de cheveux extrêmement bizarres sur TESO

Non mais ça c'est l'effet Elder Scrolls. C'est pourtant pas Bethesda qui s'y est collé, mais dans une volonté d'être fidèle à la licence Zenimax a visiblement décidé de faire des animations de merde aussi.

Sinon, je trouve que GW2 est un MMO raté, dans le sens qu'il essaye vraiment d'être un MMO à sa sauce mais ça marche pas. L'accueil reste mitigé, j'ai la moitié de ma FL qui a plus ou moins aimé, l'autre qui a détesté. Aux dernières nouvelles le PvE endgame c'est une blague, et le PvP c'est pas bien mieux, ils ont essayé de faire de l'esport dessus : échec critique. 
La meta PvE a évolué au moins ? Quand j'y jouais la compo ""opti"" c'était un truc du genre 4 guerriers et 1 gardien en berserk. Et c'était très subtil en plus, ESPADOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON TOURBILOL OMNISLASH DANS TAGGLE !!! BWAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH !!!

Mais TESO, jsais pas. J'ai l'impression qu'ils assument presque que c'est un MMO solo. Ça marchait pas quand il avait un abo, mais maintenant que c'est juste buy to play, c'est worth it de le prendre comme un Elder Scrolls au rabais, en attendant F4 ou TES 6. Ceci dit j'ai pas tenu très longtemps dessus, mais je connaissais personne sur le jeu, j'avais autre chose à foutre et avec l'âge j'ai de moins en moins de patience pour les MMOs.",null,0,null,1436752511,null,0,false,0,ct19n4w,null,t3_3d1670,null,t1_ct19n4w,null,t1_ct131i8,null,null,null,1437808408,null,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2,null

The generation out of the war wanting it to never happen again, they had the European dream. Their children, my parents, lived the dream. That's what I learned in school. And, in some way, I was taught to worship this dream. 

I was 16 in 2005 when France was asked by referendum if it wanted to adopt the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. I was always interested in politics, at the left of the spectrum, and although I couldn't vote I read the constitution. What I saw sickened me. Constitutionalizing right-wing economic policies while only hoping for a better social Union. Furthering the technocratic structure and reducing the democratic oversight of important decision. What kind of madness was that? Medias had YES propaganda 24/7 running for weeks. NO proponent were treated like scum. I hoped the NO won, and it did by a wide margin. There I had a hope that we would rather build a union based on progressive social values instead of economic principles.

In 2007 Sarkozy was elected and signed the Treaty of Lisbon, exact copy of the rejected constitution. I never integrated the European Dream they tried to teach us in school, but there I started to resent the European Union.

I'm a radical leftist. Probably more uncompromising than Tsipras, but then I'm not in charge of the politic and economic war-zone that is Greece so I can't fault him. I'm deeply internationalist. I want to see Europe thrive with cooperation, exchange, increasing social progression and harmonization. I never understood how some people could delude themselves into hoping for a federal union, but at the end of the day I probably want a lot of the same things as them.

I don't like a Union that makes us compete against each other. I don't like a Union that reacts badly when Syriza or Podemos gains traction, but don't really care when the extreme right is in power in Hungary or nordic countries, or supports neo-nazi in the Ukrainian government. I don't like a Union were some big countries can bully little ones in the name of the European dream and ""solidarity"" and ""rules"". I don't understand how anyone can fetishize the European Union or a currency to the point of defending the indefensible.

There's this quote by George Carlin: ""The reason they call it the American Dream is because you have to be asleep to believe it.""

Same could be told for the European Dream. It's nice to dream, but at some point you have to wake up and deal with the ugly reality.

The European Union as it stands as failed. It can't be the basis for a democratic federal Europe. It can't be the basis for a social Europe. The European Union as it stands needs to be dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up.

I'm going to need a source for that. Greece briefly managed a 3.5% surplus prior the new government taking over and ending some of the austerity measures, but six months of limited deficit spending isn't going to instantly require debt relief. Especially considering that originally the IMF projected Greece would need to maintain a 7.2% surplus for a decade to pay down it's debt, which was never realistic. The IMF certainly has admitted the need for a haircut, but it's not as though the sole reason for that was six months under Syriza; the need for a haircut has been evident for a long time, and that's *why* Syriza got elected — they promised they'd get it.

**Revenue** ([source](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mff/resources/index_en.cfm))

1. Traditional own resources: consist mainly of customs duties on imports from outside the EU and sugar levies. EU Member States keep 25 % of the amounts as collection costs. 

2. Own resources based on value added tax (VAT): a uniform rate of 0.3 % is levied on the harmonised VAT base of each Member States. 

3. Own resources based on GNI: each Member State transfers a standard percentage of its GNI to the EU. Although designed simply to cover the balance of total expenditure not covered by the other own resources, this system has become the largest source of revenue of the EU budget. 

----

1. Now do you really want to compare Germany Imports to Greek imports? Greece mainly imports non tariff (or special tariff) products (oil). Most of the imports come from within the EU apart from a messily 5% that comes from China. Germany's huge exporting capability is based on a similarly huge importing capability. Where Greece imports pharmaceuticals from France and pays no custom duties, Germany imports electronics from China. You know what isn't visible on the chart? The amount Germany would pay if there was import duty on the cars and TVs and refrigerators Greece imports from Germany. That's what Germany gains.

2. Peanuts here.

3. Want to compare GNI between Germany and Greece? 1300% higher.

In 2000, Schäuble was both the CDU chairman and leader of their parliamentary group, and had been earmarked by then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl to succeed him in 2002 (as soon as the Euro began circulating).

Then, Schäuble admitted that, in 1994, he accepted an illegal DM 100,000 cash ""donation"" from a German-Canadian arms dealer on behalf of his party. Under pressure from the party, he was forced to resign both his posts, with a relatively unknown Angela Merkel succeeding him as chairman, thus setting her on the path to the Chancellorship.

Probably because he did not personally benefit from the donation (i.e the bribe was not to him, although he acted as the conduit), **he was never prosecuted** and has gradually rehabilitated himself.

However, the other is how much Germany has benefited from being able to export to the countries of Europe without having to pay exchange rates and suffering from taxes, tariffs, and other such things. I bet you Germany has profited much more than it has paid back. For example, [German exports to Greece have more than doubled since Greece's introduction to the Eurozone.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/exports-to-greece) Going from ~€250 million monthly to about €700 and more. Pick any other country, like Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and you'll see the exact same trend, and even more pronounced. German [exports to Spain for example](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/exports-to-spain) have quadrupled since the Eurozone's inception, from around €1 bn monthly to about €4. 

I hope you understand how that means the net profit has risen by much more than that increase (i.e. net profit has **more** than quadrupled from the exports to Spain), since the Euro means that Germany didn't have to suffer from foreign exchange rates which are a natural balancing factor in trade deficits, nor did it have to pay any taxes or tariffs since the Eurozone is a unified trading zone. 

From just one weak country - Greece - you can see how it means about €100 billion in net increase. If you compare all of the countries that are in the Euro, how much has Germany benefited? A lot. More than a lot. Tremendously. 

So while it's nice that Germany pays back some of that money, it's not out of the goodness of their hearts. It's because it is **massively** to their interest to make it worthwhile for their weaker clients to stay in a single currency (and a *very* high-value one at that) which offers them no benefits to their own exports outside of Europe. 

In short, Greece has no way of balancing the great trade deficits it has incurred due to the Euro. Normally the drachma would depreciate, and German products would be more expensive compared to theirs; thus giving Greek ones a competitive edge abroad over German ones. Now this doesn't happen, and Greece, Portugal, Ireland, and so on, have to finance their trade deficit the only way they can. By borrowing.

A lot of reforms in the third bailout were already conditions for the first (and second) bailouts. 

Greece already received several hundred billions without honoring the promises they made in exchange. And maybe if they had done the reforms they wouldn't even need a third bailout, but of course Krugman is going to ignore this fact and pretend that because half-assed reforms don't work, reforms don't work at all.

Syriza declared the debt odious and doesn't have to be repaid, they walked out on negotiations and had a referendum after the final deadline, saying they will only accept a deal better than the 2nd bailout or else default and leave the EZ.

Now they're making promises again, for the third time, which they most likely don't intend to honor. They'll most likely take the €80B, spend it, then they'll vote for a new party that promises more free money, and revert the reforms. They'll be in an even worse situation again next year, and demand a 4th bailout.",null,0,null,1436756129,null,0,false,0,ct1bk54,null,t3_3d1ooe,null,t1_ct1bk54,null,t1_ct17663,null,null,null,1437809946,null,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10,null

Greek retirement age is 67 for both sexes, while the German retirement age is 65 for both. You ignoramus.

the privileged in Greek society -- this includes union workers/retires and public sector workers -- don't want to give up anything, even if it destroys their country.

&gt;Thousands upon thousands of government employees take to the streets to protest the bill. Here is Greece’s version of the Tea Party: tax collectors on the take, public-school teachers who don’t really teach, well-paid employees of bankrupt state railroads whose trains never run on time, state hospital workers bribed to buy overpriced supplies. Here they are, and here we are: a nation of people looking for anyone to blame but themselves. The Greek public-sector employees assemble themselves into units that resemble army platoons. In the middle of each unit are two or three rows of young men wielding truncheons disguised as flagpoles. Ski masks and gas masks dangle from their belts so that they can still fight after the inevitable tear gas. “The deputy prime minister has told us that they are looking to have at least one death,” a prominent former Greek minister had told me. “They want some blood.” Two months earlier, on May 5, during the first of these protest marches, the mob offered a glimpse of what it was capable of. Seeing people working at a branch of the Marfin Bank, young men hurled Molotov cocktails inside and tossed gasoline on top of the flames, barring the exit. Most of the Marfin Bank’s employees escaped from the roof, but the fire killed three workers, including a young woman four months pregnant.

Of course the Euro was sold as much more than that. It was sold as beginning of the Federal States of Europe. But a currency union, because of these exact problems I've been explaining, can't function without equal fiscal transfers - wealth redistribution. And since that hasn't happened except in the capacity of your post, which is far too little compared to what is necessary, essentially the poor can only keep up with the only way left to them: borrowing. 

It's not a coincidence all the ""peripheral"" economies of the Eurozone have run into borrowing trouble. Greece's is only the most acute because of their systemic problems, but the Eurozone nations will keep running into this trouble forever, Greece or no, until a fiscal transfer mechanism is implemented. 

This matter was very well known. Godley and others argued it in the 90s to no end, and it's the exact reason the UK declined to enter the currency union, they argued it in the British parliament for months and months, talking about this exact situation: Unequal competitiveness economies forced to join into a common currency, with the inevitable result of the less competitive economy collapsing.

They are giving Greece two options either to really fix the problems this time and do whatever is deemed necessary or to say goodbye to the Euro. (Naturally Greece would still be a part of the EU and ofc it would still get aid from everyone.)

Giving Greece money without fixing the underlying issues will not help Greece but only lead to the next ""loan"". 

They demand those to implement immediately things to make sure that Greece really will keep it's word this time and is willing to make the necessary reforms. 

Personally I believe that the Grexit was only brought up as a way to show that they are not willing to agree to just anything to keep Greece in the Euro and to focus the energy of everyone on reaching a deal that will ""make everyone happy"", fix Greece issues hopefully for good and keep Greece within the Euro.
