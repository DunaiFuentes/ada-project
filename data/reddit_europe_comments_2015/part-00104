In Italy, a Master's Degree is called ""Laurea Magistrale"" and has a length of 2 years. 
The admission can be with either a test or a title evaluation, this differs from university to university (you are required to have an undergraduate degree in the same field). 

Talking about IT, in Italy universities have either an Informatic Engineering (Ingegneria Informatica) or a Computer Science (Informatica) degree.

For Informatic Engineering (Ingegneria Informatica) the most known and I **assume** valid, (but as I said, it's not my field), universities are the Polytechnics. In Italy there are three Polytechnics, in Milano, Torino and Bari, and the first two should be among the country best programs (I am not saying Bari is not as good, but I never read opinions about it). 

For Computer Science (Informatica) the most known **should** be Milano Statale, Bologna and Trento (which should be an excellent university, and a smaller city). Other known unis are also Torino, Padova and Venice, but I honestly don't know about them.

(**thanks to /u/Lord_Pony and /u/simoneobo for the corrections and suggestions**)

In Italy most scholarships are public, so given directly by the university (private scholarships are few and normally limited to theses). For the first year the only criteria is income level, while for the second year, the criterias are GPA and income.
Scholarships amounts vary depending on how distant you legal residence is from university. You can be either, ""in sede/close to university"", ""pendolare/commuter"" and ""fuori sede/far from university"". 
The amounts should be around 1.500€, 2.500€, 4.800€. 
Keep in mind that due to the financial crisis, funds to universities have been drastically reduced, and as such, scholarships are becoming fewer in number every year (so don't count too much on that). 

Tuition fees are calculated with a progressive system, and can vary a lot. You normally have a first payment (prima rata) of around 800€, and a second payment (seconda rata) that depends on your income level, and should go from 0€ up to 1500€. 

Under a certain income level (should be an ISEU &lt;12.500€), you'll get almost 90% of your first payment refunded in spring. 

Anyway, universities have different tuitions fees, so you should check each university's website. 

As for cities, Milano is known for being pretty expensive, so Torino and Trento should be cheaper. 

A site you could use to compare the cost of living in different cities is: http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/comparison.jsp

I don't know how reliable it is, but it should give you a general idea of the difference of prices for flats, ecc.

If you want to have an idea of the price of rooms in different cities, you could check bakeca.it. 

[Here for example, I researched room offering for Milano, city center] (http://milano.bakeca.it/offro-camera-0?%2Futm_source%3DAdwCase/search/nope/quartiere-solocitta)
You can easily swap between cities by replacing the ""milano.bakeca.it"" with the name of the city you are looking for (ex. ""venezia.bakeca.it), while keeping the remaining address as it is.

As I said before, CS is not my field, and the data I wrote is based on my experience. So, don't think of this information as 100% reliable, since a **lot** of things differ from university to university. 

As such **take everything I wrote with a grain of salt**! 

Users who study/work in the field are certainly more knowledgable and reliable than me, so wait for their reply!

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; It paid $36m in taxes on it. 36m/7100m = .005. Much less than 2%. I quoted this article in May 2013 where Apple itself confirmed its two subs ASI and AOI paid a 2% tax rate. 

These companies are not tax resident in Ireland. They are not even located in the jurisdiction. They're based in the US. They are not liable to pay Irish corporation tax. The European commission stated that the Apple companies that are tax resident in Ireland pay the 12.5% tax rate. 

&gt; Second, the whole point is there is a huge difference between nominal and real rates. Transfer pricing and other IP tax advantages are the tools that enable tax avoidance for Ireland--they are what make the difference between being under a 12.5% legal rate, and the vastly smaller (let's use 2%) amount actually paid. For those who care about the 12.5% rate, there should be no difference between real and nominal rates. But because there is such a drastic difference, quibbling over whether the rates are 12.5% or not is meaningless. 

So you are calculating this 2% 'real' rate and you are including profits of companies that are not tax resident in Ireland to make it?

These non-tax resident Irish companies are shell companies primarily used to avoid the payment of US corporation tax. It makes no sense whatsoever to use them to calculate a 'real' rate of corporation tax for Ireland. They are used precisely because they are not tax liable and the money is not profit derived from Ireland. 

The Irish corporate tax rate is 12.5% and probably one of the most honestly enforced in all of Europe as the PWC report found. This is part of Ireland's attraction to FDI, its ease of doing business and transparency. Maybe, Revenue violated European state aid rules in dealing with Apple and transfer pricing, but there is no suggestion that Apple were given a more beneficial Irish corporate tax rate, indeed, as the EC themselves say, they were not.  

The issue of transfer pricing you are referring to is a global problem. It's also very complex. Irish registered companies, including many other countries, were and are used to facilitate tax avoidance, certainly, we can agree on that. Irish tax residency rules were always very clear and not unique.  They have now been brought in line with other European countries.

However, the main focus is on common sense politics based on complete transparency and freedom of information, and allowing the public to have a say in major decisions more than once every four years.

They are against secrecy in the government because they believe it can lead to corruption. Members of the Pirate Party were instrumental in the Wikileaks leak of official government records from all over the world. Doing that is strictly illegal, but that is because governments make laws to protect themselves from the oversight of the public. The information that came from the Wikileaks leak and Julian Assange revealed widespread government corruption and crimes from many governments around the world, information that would never have been revealed without whistleblowing. So if the government makes mistakes, the Pirate Party of Iceland believes the public has the right to know everything, and its three MPs have fought fiercely for the government to release a lot of documents and information that they didn't want to see the light of day, this has revealed a lot of bullshit going on.

From the otherside of things, many Mosques in Europe are funded from radical islam funds:

France pinpointed outside funding from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere coming into French Mosques to fund extremism.

Look, I'm not saying that everything Friedman says is wrong, he obviously also has some good arguments, but he puts too much of an emphasis on geography, and this can distort his analyses.

Geopolitics is only one of the approaches to international affairs, one that offers quite narrow answers. 
International Relations (IR) is a much wider and more complex field of science. You can start reading the wikipedia article about it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations  Foreign policy analysis also offers good insights into how states behave http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_analysis

Now, besides this academic part, in terms of analysis of current events, I would recommend you to read the product of (foreign affairs) think tanks. 
As I see you are Polish, here are two institutions from Poland which do decent work on Eastern Europe (and not only) 
http://www.osw.waw.pl/

There are many more think tanks. You can find some good ones at page 30 in this ranking of think tanks http://gotothinktank.com/dev1/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GoToReport2013.pdf

&gt;The Germans really don’t like Poles, and among Germany’s 9 neighbors, are disliked the most.

With neighbors like that - it's not surprising. If Poland would be in the same spot Germany is - we'd hate ourselves more than anyone else. ;)

&gt; Poland is considered a country of car thieves by the Germans.

That's so '90s.

&gt; Poles really shore up their hatred for their eastern &amp; southern neighbors, primarily Russia and Ukraine, although they don’t like Czechs, Slovaks or Lithuanians either. 

What? I never met a Pole who wouldn't like Czechs or Slovaks. Ever. If anything - we find them to be funny, nice people - particularly due to language which sort-of sounds like a parody of Polish (no offense meant to our Czech friends, but it's quite difficult to explain relation between our languages, and I know it doesn't work in both ways).

Ok, I did some research and [here is a Polish study](http://www.cbos.pl/SPISKOM.POL/2014/K_020_14.PDF) on how we see other nations:

* Czechs are our favorite nation. From all countries in the world.
* Second place: Italians
* 3rd: Slovaks.
* Germans took 15th place with 39% liking them, 27% being neutral and 30% not liking them
* Two neighbor countries that we dislike most are Russia and (less) Belarus. 

**With that research done I conclude that this article is pure bollocks.** ;)

&gt; Oddly, they don’t really mind the Germans, and probably still fear them a bit — you never, ever hear jokes about Germans in Poland.

Never heard of Pole, Rus and German jokes? These are nearly as popular as jokes about Pole, Czech and Rus.

null,false,rensch,NETH,The Netherlands,null,"The weird part is that provincial councillors in turn elect the Senators. Due to combined party lists between similar parties, some may snag additional seats by adding leftover votes from their befriended parties to their own. The Senate composition may therefor change compared to currently projected results. There are 75 Senate seats.

Some context about the parties:

**The coalition government:**

- **People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD):** Liberals, centre-right. Despite many recent corruption scandals involving VVD politicians, the party still did relatively well. It lost some seats, but most likely remains the largest party in the Senate, much to the relief of Prime Minister Mark Rutte who remains quite popular among right-leaning voters.

- **Labour Party (PvdA)** Social Democrats, centre-left. By far the biggest loser this election. It had to fight a harsh battle on two fronts. Left-wing voters feel betrayed by its coalition with the VVD and cuts to social security. Those people mostly defect to the Socialist Party. The party's moderate wing faces stiff competition from the centrist Democrats 66 as well. Most of the PvdA's biggest traditional strongholds are now taken over by D66 and SP. Loses several seats.

**The ""constructive three""** The coalition doesn't have a majority in the Senate and after these elections its support there will diminish further. So far these three opposition parties have helped the two governing parties pass most of its reforms and laws through the Senate. In exchange, these parties have a lot of influence on the contents of these propositions.

- **Democrats 66 (D66)** Centrists/liberal democrats. Sits in between the VVD and PvdA as a naturally constructive opposition party. D66 has made massive gains the past few years. It will likely try to make use of its increased influence in the Senate to push for greater and faster application of the reforms it deems necessary. This is the party that made the most gains this election.

- **Christian Union (CU)**: A christian party that is conservative on many social issues like LGBT rights, euthanasia and abortion, but also progressive on immigrant's rights and the environment. As an economically centrist party, it holds a position similar to D66 on these kind of issues. Makes some gains.

- **Political Reformed Party (SGP)**: Orthodox calvinists. Very conservative on social issues. Economically centre-right and therefor an ally for Rutte's economic agenda. Like the CU, it's set to make some gains

**The other opposition parties:**

One of these parties has to join the governing parties as a fourth 'constructive' party if the coalition is to retain its Senate majority.

- **Socialist Party (SP)** Leftists/socialists. Wants an end to austerity in healthcare, social security and education. Pro-Tsipras. Once a radical protest party, it has matured into a left-wing force to be reckoned with. It governs with parties of many different colours on an increasing number of city and provincial councils. Many disgruntled PvdA supporters now vote for the SP. The traditionally leftist Groningen province, which the PvdA normally holds, is now turned towards a deeper red with the SP being the largest party. This likely has a lot to do with the PvdA not taking a tough enough stance against reducing gas drilling in favour of renewable energy. Once, the gas drillings where a blessing for Groningen, nowadays they lead to earthquakes and damaged houses. Many Groningers want an eventual end to the gas drilling because of this. The SP capitalizes on this. Likely wins a ninth seat but is not willing to support Rutte's government in the Senate.

- **Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA)** Christian democrats, centre-right. The coalition and the constructive three do not have a Senate majority anymore. The CDA is a prime candidate to help out this fragile coalition, but party leader Sybrand Buma plays hard to get. He will have some demands, especially because of his party's strong showing this election. Does well and gains a seat.

- **Freedom Party (PVV)** Far-right, populist. Led by anti-EU, anti-islam politician Geert Wilders. Polled strongly initially, but ultimately seems to lose a seat. Won a psychologically important victory in the large city of Rotterdam, though. Mostly a protest party. Opposes Rutte's government.

- **Green Left (GL)** Greens, centre-left. A smaller left-of-center party that is likely to drop from five to four senators. Still, it could be an important ally for the PvdA to bring in more left-wing ideals to the negotiating table against CDA, D66 and VVD. More willing to work together with the government than the SP.

- **Party for the Animals (PvdD)** Small animal rights party. Increasingly popular among environmentalist voters. Made some gains and could win a seat.

- **50Plus** Party for senior citizens. Wins an extra seat and is projected to get two senators.

- **Independent Senate Group (OSF)** Represents provincial interest parties like the Frisian National Party and the Party for Zealand in the Senate. Keeps its sole seat.

Durante le eclissi parziali, infatti, gran parte dei raggi emessi dalla stella sono oscurati dalla Luna, che viene a interporsi tra la Terra e il Sole, ma la parte della fotosfera non oscurata ha la stessa luminosità superficiale che possiede normalmente la stella. Nell'area di oscurità, la pupilla si dilata da 2 mm fino a circa 6 mm, esponendo così ogni cellula retinea ad una quantità di luce circa dieci volte superiore rispetto alle osservazioni in condizioni normali; le cellule retinee sono così gravemente danneggiate o uccise, mentre nella retina permangono delle piccole aree di cellule morte.[12] Questo tipo di azzardo è insidioso per gli osservatori inesperti o per i bambini, perché non si ha una percezione immediata del danno causato alla vista dall'osservazione, né questo provoca dolore""

Building on his own controversial study The Pity of War, Ferguson then takes center stage with his essay ""The Kaiser's European Union: What if Britain had 'stood aside' in August 1914?"" (pp. 228-280). In The Pity of War, Ferguson suggests that Britain's decision to go to war with Germany and its allies in 1914 was catastrophic for Britain's future development; in this essay, Ferguson boldly outlines an alternative history in which Germany would have won the First World War, leaving Britain truculent but unscathed.

Based on his interpretation of Germany's pre-war aims, Ferguson concludes that Germany would have consolidated its victory into a recognizable variant of the European Union under German hegemony; that Russia had a better chance of transition to a constitutional monarchy or a parliamentary republic than a slide into civil war and Communism; and America would not have been drawn into European affairs. Moreover, Ferguson suggests, the severe strains that the First World War brought to the world economy would have been abated if not evaded by a swift German victory and British abstention, and a victorious Kaiser would have been a preferable alternative to the weak democracy and power vacuum that allowed the rise of Fascism, Nazism, and Hitler.",null,0,null,1426790878,null,0,false,0,cpk5jos,null,t3_2zl5fj,null,t1_cpk5jos,null,t1_cpk3rv3,null,null,null,1427859184,null,-3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-3,null

This is the problem though. You think that you are entitled to something that others created. But you are not. If you have trouble getting this digital product, then that is simply your problem. It is your prerogative to choose to not buy the product, but you do NOT have the right to just steal it because it is more convenient. 


You may justify this by saying that its too expensive or hard to get which is why you choose to steal it. Which is where I say that you should be punished like a criminal, which you are, if you do so. That might deter some of the would be thieves out there.

Ça, c'est juste **ton** avis. Moi, je parle des gens, pas de la récupération politique (toute manif est de toute façon récupérée, ou du moins y a t il des tentatives).

J'y ai vu des gens sincèrement touchés.  Je trouve pas ça très malin d'aller caricaturer ce genre de sentiments avec l'image postée dans le titre. 

T'as bien sûr le droit de penser que tout cela est un sketch, que ces gens jouent la comédie, ont déjà oublié la manif, mais encore une fois,  ça n'est que ton avis. Tu ne sais pas ce que font ni pensent les gens après. 

&gt;C'est mieux que rien? Pourrait-on se dire. Je ne sais pas.

Bah je suis prêt à t'écouter : quel geste t'aurait semblé plus pertinent? Parce que des suggestions du genre "" [..] nous amener à réfléchir"",c'est pas très sympa pour les autres.Personne n'a réfléchi selon toi? 4 millions d'abrutis? Je vois pas en quoi la manif exclut la réflexion...

&gt;Ca calme faussement leur instinct de reproduction, et pendant quelques instants ils oublient l'angoisse de voir leur espèce disparaitre

Oué avec moi, c'est peine perdue,  les analyses pseudo Freudiennes, j'y crois pas une seconde.

Let's start here. 

&gt; These companies are not tax resident in Ireland.

This is precisely the problem. It is discussed [here](http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/apple-paid-36m-tax-on-7-11bn-profits-at-irish-unit-1.1715727), [here](http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2013/0521/451564-apple-tax-arrangements/), and [here](http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/apple-warns-it-may-have-to-pay-irish-back-tax-1.1982462). 

ASI= Apple Sales International. AOI=Apple Operations International 

See here:
&gt; ASI is unlimited in Ireland, so does not need to file annual accounts. However, between 2000 and 2009, ASI was obliged to file its Irish accounts with authorities in Australia.

So this sub is not resident in Ireland. Likewise,
&gt; Money made outside of the US was “taxed in the local market”, Mr Cook said, before being transferred to Apple Operations International, which is registered in Ireland but managed and controlled in the US.

Another company registered in Ireland but not resident in it. 

Actually, for both ASI and AOI,
&gt; These are understood to include the two so-called “stateless” Apple subsidiaries that have registered addresses in Cork but which up until recently have not been tax resident anywhere.

they are registered and operating in Cork, but not resident for tax in Ireland. However, at least one is not resident anywhere else either: 

&gt; It said that AOI, though Irish registered, is not a tax resident of Ireland or any other country, and has paid no corporation tax to any government over the past five years. 

&gt; AOI accounts for almost a third of Apple's total profits.

&gt; The second company, ASI, does make an Irish tax return, but in 2011 paid corporation tax of just $10m on profits of over $22bn - an effective tax rate of 0.05%.

&gt; The Senate report said Apple executives claimed they had negotiated a special rate of corporation tax with the Irish Government, which has been less than 2% over the past decade.

AOI is also sitting on 145bn in offshore reserves.

Yet, 
&gt; Despite having sales that totalled more than $150 billion in the four years to 2012 they have paid less than €10 million a year in Irish corporation tax.

&gt; Irish authorities had told the commission the company’s taxable profits in Ireland had been between €30 million to €40 million for 2009 and 2010; between €50 million and €60 million in 2011; and between €40 million and €50 million in 2012.

So we have 2 companies registered in Cork, not tax resident anywhere, making 150bn in profit, while Ireland reported only 50 million, upon which was paid 'between 1 and 10 million' per year in tax. 

Yet for some reason you don't seem to feel it's a problem that a) a company can be 'stateless' ie 'not tax resident in any jurisdiction owing to a loophole in Irish tax law.', and b) profits which by your own definition don't belong to the Irish market are being run through the Irish subs, yet Ireland doesn't benefit from the taxation that they ought to produce for it. 

&gt; So you are calculating this 2% 'real' rate and you are including profits of companies that are not tax resident in Ireland to make it?

I cited the 2% based on what Apple itself said to the US Senate. See the articles. I calculated .005% myself, which is also in the articles. 

&gt; These non-tax resident Irish companies are shell companies primarily used to avoid the payment of US corporation tax. It makes no sense whatsoever to use them to calculate a 'real' rate of corporation tax for Ireland. They are used precisely because they are not tax liable and the money is not profit derived from Ireland.

You've a knack for saying what the problem is without noticing that it's the problem. The *only* purpose for the Irish subs is to transfer profits through the Irish market without accruing tax liability, and that is the system we deliberately set up. That this is possible makes the 12.5% rate utterly meaningless; there's no reason to even consider it when it can be bypassed by loose regulatory structures finally closed amidst pressure. Remember that all of this was denied until further details came to light in international media last year. 

&gt; The Irish corporate tax rate is 12.5% and probably one of the most honestly enforced in all of Europe as the PWC report found. 

Are ye having a laugh? The PWC report had nothing to do with international companies. It's subject matter is purely domestic. Which is why it was meaningless to discuss, as u/bowgentle pointed out. It's an apology by a company who helped to facilitate the deals which have come to light by the LuxLeaks scandal and the EC investigations. 

What's transparent or honest and easy to enforce when it doesn't always apply? 

&gt; This is part of Ireland's attraction to FDI, its ease of doing business and transparency.

What's clear is that the reason MNEs are in Ireland in such numbers is that it was so easy to not have to pay taxes. That's the only transparent part, and the government simply uses the 12.5% citation to obfuscate. Yet thankfully it caves to pressure.

&gt; there is no suggestion that Apple were given a more beneficial Irish corporate tax rate, indeed, as the EC themselves say, they were not.

Here is Apple saying they got one:

Myth of the winter war is very strong, and not to be underestimated. Even Russians have fear, or at a very least respect to Finns. That's why he gets all these upvotes.

&gt;Finland might have reserves of 350k men, but does it have the equipment and supplies ready for them at a short notice that will have them at modern standards (not 1939 standards with a flask of water and a bolt rifle) ? 

Well, Russians can, that's certain. Something I highlight every time people underestimate Russia: [NATO-Russia Exercise gap](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/the-nato-russia-exercise-gap).

That said though - Finland won't be attacked by 3400 planes nor even majority of Western Military District forces.

It would surprise you to learn that the world doesn't work in dichotomies. It's not one or the other.  
Just like it's not ""neo-nazi"" or ""defender of religious oppression"". There are other options (though you can't seem to grasp that).  
  
&gt; So if you knew that your sentences would be interpreted not the way you meant them, why did you write them in the first place? 
  
I had hope. I'm an optimist like that, still hoping you're smarter than our previous dealings indicate.  
  
&gt; Don't you think this is getting a little silly? Probabely half of Europe is Islamophobic. Including yourself. And you still deny it even exists. Don't you think that this is even more silly? Ask a casual homophobic (I am not against gays, I just don't want them near my family) person if they are homophobic. And they will go to great length to explain that they are not.  
  
Still comparing ideas to accidents of births. Fuck it, you're too thick.  
I've been more than patient. Ok, I'll be even more patient and try one last time:
If I criticise libertarianism, am I randianophobic? No. If I criticise communism, am I communistophobic? No. **Religions belong to the same grouping as political ideologies, not accidents of birth**.  
  
&gt; The non hearing community strongly believes they are not disabled. They can live a full live. They would be offended, if you would call them ""defective"".  
  
A common myth. Some might feel like that. Others, like my partially deaf friend, would give everything to have normal hearing.  
  
&gt; Where right wing extremists try to enforce their agenda in schoolbooks.  
  
You're really deluded if you don't think groups like Sharia4Belgium don't belong in that ""right wing extremists"" classification.  
Truth is, the differences between Breivik and Belkacem are merely superficial. You just have to substitude one god for the other and then they're exactly the same.  
  
&gt; I also don't expect you to accept your own racism.

""Scientific High Schools"" here are pretty hard and demanding regarding math, maybe even harder than a ""Advanced Math"" High School course in the US (I do not have enough knowledge about the UK though).

First of all, I wonder why in the hell a person without enough English skill has been sent there. As far as I know, only the brightest students are selected for this kind of experience.

By the way, back to the topic: though they are trying to implement the use of certain software (eg: derive) it's still not that important. Derive is free to download and it is also both simple to use and very useful. So is GeoGebra, a must-have if you are going to teach her how to draw functions IMHO.

I'd first like to know if she was attending a ""liceo scientifico"" just like me. Also you could e-mail his previous math teacher to get the full list of topics (which may differ from the one listed in her syllabus).

I can't really tell you the exact list of topic for the fourth year of ""Scientific High School"" because:

1- I was the last with a certain type of High School course, anyone who has attended the ""Scientific High School"" after me has a slightly different one

2- The topics might differ from school to school

Nach dem ich die Polizei verständigt hatte und ich mich vom Fahrzeug ferngehalten habe um keine Spuren zu verwischen kam nach ca. 1 Stunde dann ein älterer Polizist an. Dieser holte eine Digitale Kompaktkamera heraus und macht einige Fotos. Nachdem er die paar Fotos gemacht hatte war seine Spurensicherung erledigt.

Also nichts wie der Versuch Fingerabdrücke , Reifenabdrücke geschweige denn Fußabdücke welche noch sichtbar waren zu sichern. Allerdings hat er nach meinem Hinweis wenigsten versucht ein Foto mit seiner knippse von den Fußabdrücken zu machen. Aber auch dies ohne jeglichen Maßstab im Foto woraus man wenigsten auf die Schuhgröße hätte schließen können.

This is so true. Although there's this view that many British (and others) have, that Spain is very racist. It's not. I mean, there's racism, like... everywhere else. But it's not worse than say Britain or France.

Some people mix up being racist with not being absolutely obsessed with races - some people may found offensive to distinguish someone by their looking, like pointing out ""that chinese right there""... but that's very normal and NATURAL in Spanish, and it's not offensive nor racist at all for Spaniards. Spain has been very isolated for many years, we haven't had any big influx of immigrants until very recently... when we got A LOT.

A-t-on questionné sérieusement les responsable de la sécurité des membres de Charlie Hebdo?

null,false,large_butt,EART,LEO,null,"&gt;I would expect that the weapons used on the Eurofighter are non-American as well.

The Eurofighter can indeed use some non-American weapons, but compatibility with/training with/having American weaponry is a pretty pragmatic thing to do. 

Precision bombing (GPS and/or laser guidance being the most common) is an almost purely American thing. JDAM kits and Paveway-family munitions make up the vast majority of the West's precision bomb arsenal. If your aircraft can use them, you don't have to spend money developing and building your own, you don't need to haul special-snowflake ordnance along* when you go do something with NATO, and -- in the event that you actually need to bomb things -- America will have the bombs you need to rearm**.


\*: Europe as a whole has very little (practically no) strategic airlift and sealift capability, so minimizing your logistical footprint is a very smart thing to do if you're in charge of making decisions like this.

\*\*: One of the most financially painful bits of modern conventional warfare is that it's too fast. It takes a long time and a lot of effort to develop weapons/platforms that are worth having today, and the development process is *heavily* reliant on institutional experience. It's simply not possible to develop and build things when you need them. War eats bombs like candy, so if you actually need to bomb things, you *have* to be able to use the American weapons because no European nation maintains stockpiles anywhere near large enough to last for more than a few days of moderate-intensity conflict.",null,0,null,1426793809,null,0,false,0,cpk7fva,null,t3_2zl1re,null,t1_cpk7fva,null,t1_cpk3flr,null,null,null,1427860137,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

&gt;""Scientific High Schools"" here are pretty hard and demanding regarding math, maybe even harder than a ""Advanced Math"" High School course in the US (I do not have enough knowledge about the UK though).

Yeah the usual 'high school' Mathematics course in England is not very difficult, which is why some schools choose to do MEI or Further Mathematics. Unfortunately the school I teach at does not offer these so I am going to teach her separately after school.

&gt;First of all, I wonder why in the hell a person without enough English skill has been sent there. As far as I know, only the brightest students are selected for this kind of experience.

Sorry if I wasn't clear, her English is actually very good and she is very bright, but she doesn't know how to translate all of the mathematical language and terminology. And I don't want to have to get her to translate all the content to me so that I can teach it to her.

&gt;By the way, back to the topic: though they are trying to implement the use of certain software (eg: derive) it's still not that important. 

By not important do you mean that using the software is not important (that I can just teach her the Mathematics normally) or that it's not important because it is free and easy to use?

&gt;Also you could e-mail his previous math teacher to get the full list of topics (which may differ from the one listed in her syllabus).

Good point! I'll ask her tomorrow about whether she attended a liceo scientifico, and ask for the contact information for her previous Maths teacher.

&gt; The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking **forthwith**, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the **use of armed force**, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

Mine (California) didn't and I had to pay a fair amount of money to take the test in Italy. It was 500 euros (? it was a while ago) with the classes. [Here is the list of states with agreements with Germany](http://germany.usembassy.gov/acs/drivers_license/). I imagine it's similar with Italy.~~

I can't find anything about those states converting to Italian, so I take it back. [Here is the Italian transportation ministry's website on the subject.](http://www.mit.gov.it/mit/site.php?p=cm&amp;o=vd&amp;id=308) I don't see any US states.

Check if your phone is locked with your carrier. If it's not just get an Italian plan and sim card. You'll want an Italian plan, and I imagine you wont want to pay for your US one while you're not using it. I had Tre which I thought was the best deal at the time. It switched to TIM in the countryside so coverage wasn't a problem. 

You wont need a car most of the time, but they can be nice when the weather is good. Think about renting if you wont use it that much. Otherwise you can lease from France. I know Americans who stayed in Italy a year and did that, I asked them recently for a friend moving to Italy for a year and he sent me the following explanation of how they did it:

&gt;The car arrangement was a good one. We did it twice actually. Peugeot both
times. That is all they offer on this program. It's an unusual setup between
Peugeot and the EU, in which you legally own the car, even though it is in
effect a long-term rental, but are required to ""sell"" it back to AutoEurope,
under their ""Buy Back"" program. It's an all-around good deal, and it
bypasses the legal issues with Americans owning vehicles in Italy.  We
picked up the first car from the Rome airport. The second one from Zurich.
You do not have to return the vehicle to the location from which you picked
it up, just one of their indicated locations.
http://www.autoeurope.com/buyback_home.cfm.  I made all the initial
arrangements through their web site, and eventually spoke to an agent. You
will need all the necessary documentation, but the web site makes that
clear.

Good to know, she wouldn't have a chance otherwise.

&gt;By not important do you mean that using the software is not important (that I can just teach her the Mathematics normally) or that it's not important because it is free and easy to use?

When I attended my High School this kind of software was used to make it simpler for us to understand how a particular exercise had to be done.

Example: geogebra draws the curve of a given function. Our teacher used to show us the exact solution of his exercises using it (better that drawing ""crazy"" curves on the blackboard with chalk, the bane of precision). Since it's free we could check at home if we did everything in the right way.

Something might have changed since I passed the final exam, as I said I was the last attending a particular course in ""Scientific high School"", those younger than me are attending a slightly different one. That's why it is wise to contact his italian math teacher. Feel free to ask any other question if you need!

Satellite-guided bombs in general are nice because they're relatively cheap and simple. The American JDAM is actually not a bomb at all: it's a bolt-on conversion kit that uses a combination of inertial and GPS guidance (new ones also feature laser guidance) to turn existing unguided bombs into precision bombs.

The main drawback is that they can't be used to strike moving targets -- the aircraft's avionics ""talk"" to the bomb and tell it, among other things, the coordinates it should guide itself to. These can't be updated once the bomb is no longer attached to the aircraft, which makes it difficult to hit stuff that isn't standing still.

That's not to say that they're not worth having, though! Satellite guidance means that, unlike laser-guided bombs, they work just fine in bad weather.

...but, uh, to actually answer your question. Having a Galileo-guided bomb would be a pretty useful thing for the EU, but you're correct in suspecting that it would be premature.

I would like to point out that people that did work for the state suffered, but you actually have the wrong categories in your list ;)
Everyone was working for the state during Communism, but the biggest layoffs targeted engineers and factory workers, not those part of the current state institutions.

I'm not saying that post office clerks and train conductors didn't lose their jobs, but they were a minority as opposed to workers at the huge Communist steel mills or car factories or other heavy industries the Communists loved.

My point is that unfortunately some generations were sacrificed, but it was because of Communism, not capitalism. Communism couldn't adapt to a changing world and it brought down millions of innocent people with it. Those are currently the ""old"" people I mentioned (if you were 35-40 in 1990 and couldn't retrain for a new job, you're 60-65 years old now).

And this is what you do: apparently I do not even deserve to be heard because I think a burning police car is not the end of the world? Really? Does not even matter if I did it or not?

Imagine a mob of a thousand Nazis denying the holocaust, is their issue more valid or reasonable to be heard because they managed to not damage anything while marching?

But yes, in the end I am also mad for the protest itself for giving in to this stupid rhetoric of what proper protest is and is not. Because, again, its not helpful.

C'est sure que s'il utilise un VPN et qu'il est prudent vous êtes impuissants, et j'envie de dire, c'est internet, on ne peut pas traquer les pédophiles sur TOR non plus, c'est pareil, on est impuissant.

Je croyais tout de même que dans cette communauté, on avait une base à peu prêt commune qui est que ""l'excès de liberté vaut mieux qu'un excès de tyrannie"", dans notre cas que l'a présomption d'innocence vaut mieux qu'un ban arbitraire.

Dans le cas présent, qu'est ce qui vous dit que vous n'avez pas commis une injustice ? Pour aller encore plus loin dans l'absurde : comment /u/smx1337 fait pour prouver qu'il n'est pas /u/MauvaisConseil ?

Je suis conscient que vous êtes coincés dans cette histoire mais c'est le moment de bien réfléchir entre modos ou même d'associer tout le monde parce que c'est un cas de conscience quand même d'abandonner la présomption d'innocence pour passer sur de la présomption de culpabilité.

A similar question exists in Spain, where the constitution does not allow for a Catalan referendum. It would be solved in a civilized manner.

&gt;Why didn't they conduct a referendum in Donetsk and Lugansk when the areas were peacefully demanding it?

Who was peacefully demanding it? The people taking over government buildings with automatic rifles? Get real. Even if this wasn't a crisis completely manufactured abroad, but still involved such violence, what country would allow that to happen? Not Greece.

""The areas demanded it"", sounds so nice and vague but conveniently neglects to mention it was an armed takeover orchestrated by a neighbouring country.

Bottom line: actual grassroots peaceful political process advocating separatism is fine and would not have resulted in a war. But in Donbass, that never took place. An armed rebellion installed a separatist regime of people who were never elected to hold any office in anything resembling real elections. These rebels were armed, trained and funded from Russia, and included many Russian citizens. The takeover of Sloviansk, for example was carried out by Russian nationals lead by Girkin, an FSB agent. He said so himself.

Yes? Iraq had zero Anti-air ability against the Coalition. Land forces were demolished on the ground from the air. Coalition air losses were from friendly fire. Situation was the same on the ground, US army was pretty much armed with Tigers which blobbed Iraqi Stuart tanks from range they could not even reach or affect.

This is just one big pile of excuses for stealing. Again. You are not entitled to any digital products. They are not a human right. If you think they are a hassle don't buy them.


&gt; Copyright is a big issue.

Yes it is. But not for the reasons you state. You steal products because they are ""inconvenient"" to get or use. You are a thief, plain and simple. I don't steal a new car, because my old car has bad breaks or lack air-conditioning.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; they are registered and operating in Cork, but not resident for tax in Ireland. However, at least one is not resident anywhere else either: 

Apple are operating in Cork, but these two companies you refer to certainly are not. They are shell companies based in the US. If they were operating in Cork, then they would have to pay Irish corporation tax, if they were Irish registered or not. 

&gt; Yet for some reason you don't seem to feel it's a problem that a) a company can be 'stateless' ie 'not tax resident in any jurisdiction owing to a loophole in Irish tax law.', and b) profits which by your own definition don't belong to the Irish market are being run through the Irish subs, yet Ireland doesn't benefit from the taxation that they ought to produce for it. 

I do have a problem with that, but the Irish rules were changed in the budget several years ago. Why are these companies clearly resident in America not subject to US corporate tax? If these were American companies and based in Ireland, they would be subject to Irish corp tax. 

&gt; I cited the 2% based on what Apple itself said to the US Senate. See the articles. I calculated .005% myself, which is also in the articles. 

Apple have never said that they get a 2% corporate tax rate in Ireland, as you claim. The EC clearly state that Apple pay 12.5%. As i said, the number you said is a misinterpretation. You're including the profits of non tax-resident shell companies used to transfer profits from around Europe. 

&gt; That this is possible makes the 12.5% rate utterly meaningless; there's no reason to even consider it when it can be bypassed by loose regulatory structures finally closed amidst pressure. Remember that all of this was denied until further details came to light in international media last year.

It certainly doesn't. Any company with its main base of operations in Ireland is charged 12.5%. Now, all Irish registered companies are included. I doubt very much the Government denied it, Ireland's tax residency rules are freely available and open. 

&gt; Are ye having a laugh? The PWC report had nothing to do with international companies. It's subject matter is purely domestic. Which is why it was meaningless to discuss, as u/bowgentle pointed out. It's an apology by a company who helped to facilitate the deals which have come to light by the LuxLeaks scandal and the EC investigations. 

The report looks, obviously, at tax resident companies. Are you disputing its methodology? It's in no way meaningless. 

&gt; What's clear is that the reason MNEs are in Ireland in such numbers is that it was so easy to not have to pay taxes. That's the only transparent part, and the government simply uses the 12.5% citation to obfuscate. Yet thankfully it caves to pressure.

How did you come to that? There is a requirement for, as far as i remember, two Irish registered companies for this to work. One company is resident in Ireland and transfers the money to another which is not resident. In Apple's case, as you can see by just looking up the details, these companies are basically shell companies.  

These multinationals do not have actual operations here because of corporation tax. There is no requirement for Intel, Apple or Google to have manufacturing, admin or servers in Ireland for corporate tax reasons. 

They're here because Ireland is more competitive in general. The loophole has already been closed yet these companies, among others, are expanding their operations here. This was a loophole in Irish and US tax policy that has been exploited, one of many loopholes available to these companies.  

&gt; What's clear is that the reason MNEs are in Ireland in such numbers is that it was so easy to not have to pay taxes. That's the only transparent part, and the government simply uses the 12.5% citation to obfuscate. Yet thankfully it caves to pressure.

&gt; there is no suggestion that Apple were given a more beneficial Irish corporate tax rate, indeed, as the EC themselves say, they were not.

&gt; Here is Apple saying they got one:

&gt; When asked about its reasons for operating in Ireland, CEO Tim Cook said that the company had received a “tax incentive arrangement” as part of its decision to establish here in 1980.

&gt; And that bit about the EC believing Apple weren't given this special arrangement is rubbish. It's the whole reason they are investigating. It's why they gave a 21 page report outlining preliminarily, exactly how Ireland did it. 

You are very clearly misrepresenting what i, the EC and the Apple CEO have said! 

The CEO claims that they got a “tax incentive arrangement”. I've never disputed that, though we'll have to see if it broke state aid rules. He never claimed that they got a deal on Irish corporate tax and the EC themselves state that Apple paid 12.5%. 

I feel you are seriously misrepresenting the issue and it's important to be, at the least, exact and fair to explain exactly what is happening. 

(1) Apple pay 12.5% Irish corporation tax. They do not pay 2% or .5% or anything else. This is just the reality. I have no reason to doubt the EC on that. Legally, they couldn't pay anything but that.  

(2) Ireland does appear to have a relatively honest effective corporate tax [rate](http://www.iiea.com/blogosphere/effective-eu-corporate-tax-rates) for companies that are liable to pay it. 

(3) The EC investigation is specifically into whether Ireland offered Apple 'state aid.' It is not an investigation of Ireland's corp tax rate or corp tax residency rules. Both of these were and still are open and entirely legal under European law. 

You are right to say that the Irish registered companies were used to avoid tax due to specific loopholes in Irish and US corporate tax rules. They have now been closed on the Irish side, but not the US side. 

Ireland's tax residency rules were legal and transparent. Cyprus, Slovenia and Slovakia, among many other countries, have similar residency rules to [Ireland](http://economic-incentives.blogspot.ie/2014/03/residence-and-test-of-management-and.html). Ireland has changed the rules to be more like the UK now, or so i believe. There hasn't been a mass exodus of companies to Slovakia just yet, i doubt there ever will be, though the shell company in California may become Slovakian instead of Irish in a few years.

No, they are not, but they can be used in that way, yes. First random example - Poland. We have huge tank army, 5th in Europe for that matter, and yet in no way they're going to be used for any sort of attack on other nation - we got them purely for defensive purposes.

&gt; What we need is more planes since we only really have 1 outdated jet fighter and a bunch of soviet ww2 planes

I would argue that it's a worse investment than MBTs. Every Baltic country borders Russia directly and is small enough for modern Russian long range anti-air missiles to create area denial over significant part of it's air space without crossing the border, and I doubt any of baltics or even all combined can get an air force significant enough to make a difference - while at the same time it's very expensive to purchase and much more expensive to maintain than IVFs or MBTs are. Modern MBTs capable of urban warfare, such as Leopard 2 A7+ could at least take part in some battles and inflict causalities to the enemy before being taken out by.

In my humble opinion what Baltics could use is a higher number of modern MPADs, few medium range anti-air missiles such as Rapier, hidden and widespread caches of anti-tank missiles (especially in urban areas),  man portable UAVs and as you said - hardware for soldiers.

Also some specialized equipment could be very beneficial. Jamming equipment for electronic warfare, laser designators (for NATO air force to provide support), counter-battery radars, night vision, body armor, etc. Joining one of *future soldier* projects from other NATO nations could also be very beneficial for the performance of your army while at the same time nowhere near as expensive as developing your own project.

There are none of those on the border of Finland/Russia, simpy swamps, bogs, forests, lakes and rivers. Pretty much the opposite you want when you need to move fast with heavy equipment.   
   
&gt;does it have the equipment and supplies ready for them at a short notice.   
   
Yes. Rest of Europe has been lowering their equipment and military budgets, we have been buying stuff they decided they don't need for almost free. Our biggest problem would be keeping up with ammunition spending.   
    
&gt;Because in the 21st century we are spoiled pampered bastards, we're not just gonna drop our McDonalds and switch off our cartoons and get into the swing of killing, actual military experience to harden you up is valuable.   
    
It is valuable, but not like its going to decide how the war goes. Majority of Russian troops would be people who have never been to war as well. Nevermind that the conscript training in Russia is fucking pathetic, these dudes won't be half a soldier one Finn will be. As for getting into swing of killing, doubt its that huge of a thing, its been done for as long as history has been written and getting into military shape was not that magical thing when I did my service. And Finns apparently has a [""warrior gene""](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29760212) so were good on that.  
  
&gt;Great, but you're still comparing an Air Force of 150 planes with one of over 3,400.    
      
I am not though. First Russia will never send 3,400 planes to Finland, ever. I really doubt they would even send half, a quarter at best and even then you have to wonder how many of their planes are operational at any given moment. Secondly, they will be operating in hostile airpace with all sorts of anti-air ground forces that will make it a bitch to operate.

Yes. And that's where the United States is going, because it's squandering goodwill. The pompous, arrogant, jingoist trolling Americans are doing on this thread exemplifies everything that is wrong with the United States today.

&gt; No other ""empire"" can project power the way the U.S. can currently.

Sigh. Another clown using phrases like ""power projection"" picked up from discussions between armchair geostrategists on Reddit.

The United States has an unparalleled military. But you are becoming universally hated by the world. You are losing goodwill everywhere, including from your friends and allies, who you shamelessly wiretap and hack, then tell them they are jealous of your psychotic self if they protest.

You tell them to spend more on defense, you threaten to leave, but you cannot live without the dependency, you love the kick of being needed. So yeah, it is a discussion. Things like this don't change suddenly, but they will change, and the U.S. will eventually crumble. You know this in your heart, which is why you and the other Captain America wannabes in this thread spare no effort or self-degradation spewing jingoist platitudes on /r/europe.

Culturally, historically and geographically Ukraine is part of Europe, but you're of course welcome to drop and add countries at will in your own mind, -Ukraine +Mongolia for example.

&gt;Ukraine with its corruption would never let land go peacefully and history showed that.

Completely baseless claim, likely based on your personal biases. Again, not sure why someone from Greece would dismiss a country's right to sovereignty based on corruption. The irony should be way too painful, but something is malfunctioning there...

&gt;The armed takeover happened later, there were protests before, but nobody gave attention to them, since Ukraine was busy with a coop and they failed to address that issue.

What issue? Ukraine was preparing for a free and fair presidential elections after having ousted a dictator. Rival protests were held by small minorities of people in cities in Donbass. For example in Donetsk, by far the largest city in the region, the most numerous pro-Russian protest was 10,000 people, and the most numerous pro-Ukrainian-unity rally was also ~10,000. There was a political conflict that would have been resolved peacefully if Russia did not start its creeping military aggression. There were no reasons for people in Donbass to take up arms, and no means for them to do so other than being supplied from Russia.

Q1 is easier to answer: as far as i understand it, your landlady can't ask you to pay for a renovation, if it is due after you move out.

Q2: if you moved in to the apartment and it wasn't renovated, you don't have to do Schönheitsreparaturen. However, the burden of proof that the apartment wasn't renovated when you moved in lies with you.

the blogpost i posted earlier explains this quite well, there is also a file number mentioned. if you google that you'll find more information on this topic.

Which is where I say that you should be punished like a criminal, which you are, if you do so. That might deter some of the would be thieves out there.

The problem is that there are no good way catch those who pirate without large scale surveillance and monitoring of online traffic, which I am personally very much against.

&gt; But i do agree that DRM is a big problem. But the cause is people like you. If no one pirated, companies would not need to spend resources developing DRM.

It is true they claim to be instigated by pirating, but it is still ultimately the company's own choice to put idotic DRM on their products.

And are you truly against **all** use of someone else's work without paying? What about if I use a picture you made in a video for a tenth of a second? Or in a power point presentation? I'm sure there are more examples where you maybe would find it acceptable. So, if you're not against it in all situation, could you formulate when it is unacceptable, for example when the other person makes commercial gains, or the maker loses money as a result of pirating.

 Because it seems to me that when I pirate an episode of Game of Thrones to indulge in instead of dicking around on reddit for an hour, the makers of the show don't lose any money, I've bought the books so I've given the inventor of the original idea money. Hell, Swedish national TV shows the series, so they've essentially paid a license for the entire Swedish population to watch it. Pirating websites just provides it in a format convenient to me.

Which brings up my next point, there is no pure pirating website which has only pirated content. All pirating websites simply allow their users to upload whatever the fuck they want, legal or illegal. And then others can download what they want, freely, without anyone surveying them. This in my opinion, is good, it is freedom, it should be kept, going on a crusade after pirates will cause these websites to be forced to shutdown or start to monitor the content they are hosting, hell, all online communication would have to be monitored in order to catch all pirates, even though even I realize no one in their right mind would take such measures. What I'm saying is trying to catch pirates will in practice lead to a less open and free internet.

The -erl ending, as has been said, is a dimunitive used in southern Bavaria and Austria -- a diminutive is a suffix that indicates something small or something you feel attachment to, and is often used in ""baby talk"" -- like in English, the -kins on the end of ""bunnykins"". It can also be used satirically or patronisingly.

Other diminutives you may see, some in standard German and some local variants include -el, -l, -le, -li, -lein, -chen, -i, -ke, -je, -tje and -ling. There are quite a lot to choose from, as you can see; ""-lein"" is quite well known everywhere, ""-chen"" is probably the standard version, and ""-ling"" has found its way into a lot of standard words such as ""Steckling"" for a cutting (from a plant) and ""Jüngling"" for a youngster.",null,0,null,1426800142,null,0,false,0,cpkbi7m,null,t3_2zmbsw,null,t1_cpkbi7m,null,t1_cpkayxn,null,null,null,1427862068,null,4,false,German,t5_2qq51,4,null

I am not comming forth with a new way to combat pirating, just saying that is it theft, pure and simple. 


&gt; It is true they claim to be instigated by pirating, but it is still ultimately the company's own choice to put idotic DRM on their products.


Why would they add DRM if no one was pirating? I agree that DRM is stupid for paying customers, but I feel that that the pirating culture that is prevalent on Reddit, is contributing to DRM. If people stopped pirating there would be no DRM. Plain and simple.


&gt; And are you truly against all use of someone else's work without paying? What about if I use a picture you made in a video for a tenth of a second?


So using "" a picture you made in a video for a tenth of a second"" is equivalent to pirating a movie or game? You are just being obtuse at this point. 


&gt; Because it seems to me that when I pirate an episode of Game of Thrones to indulge in instead of dicking around on reddit for an hour, the makers of the show don't lose any money, I've bought the books so I've given the inventor of the original idea money. 


The maker of the show are not the makers of the book. I don't see your point in this thread? You are not giving HBO any money in buying the books.



&gt; Hell, Swedish national TV shows the series, so they've essentially paid a license for the entire Swedish population to watch it.


Give me a source on a Swedish ""national TV show"" that has bought the license. We have danish tv channels here in Denmark who have bought the show license, but they rely on commercials. They are private channels. I very much doubt that ""public channels"" have bought a license for ""game of Thrones"". Even if they have, that does not give you the right to steal it on the internet. You have to watch it on those respective channels.


&gt;  Pirating websites just provides it in a format convenient to me.

There are a lot of commodities that are more convenient if I steal them. Is that the moral thing to do though? No, it is not. Just because it is convenient, does not make it a right. 

&gt; there is no pure pirating website which has only pirated content.


I never stated otherwise. I just said that pirating was theft. You can torrent whatever you want on ""The Piratebay"" as long as it is legal.

null,false,einheiteulenspiegel,null,null,null,"Anarcho-Kapitalismus bedeutet nicht Rechtsfreiheit, sondern eine Privatisierung aller Güter, auch den Rechts- und Sicherheitsprodukten, für welche der Staat bisher das Monopol beansprucht. Er führt in eine Privatrechtsgesellschaft ohne Staat (für genauere Ausführungen vielleicht einfach mal googlen, kann das jetzt nicht alles ausführen, bitte um Verständnis).

Du gehst in deinem Gedankengang davon aus, dass eine Privatisierung ausschließlich Preissteigerungen mit sich bringt, genau das Gegenteil ist der Fall. Nur bei einer Monopolisierung eines Gutes wird dessen Qualität schlechter und der Preis steigt. Freier Wettbewerb verhindert dies und ist somit vor allem für die Konsumenten besser, da diese eine freie Wahl haben, welche Produkte sie zu welchem Preis kaufen möchten. Ein Monopolist zu sein, was sich jeder Unternehmer wünscht, ist somit auf dem freien Markt niemals möglich.

Natürlich muss jede Leistung, die man in Anspruch nimmt vergütet werden. Freiheit bedeutet nicht Kostenfreiheit. Wenn man für keine Leistungen bezahlen will, kann man auch keine in Anspruch nehmen. Alles andere wäre Diebstahl. Vergess aber nicht, dass durch den Wegfall aller(!) bisherigen Steuerzahlungspflichten jeder Mensch auch viel mehr Geld zur Verfügung hat und dieses nur seinen Interessen dienen muss, nicht denen von anderen, welchen er vielleicht widerspricht. Das ist auch der Grund, warum es in einer Privatrechtsgesellschaft vermutlich eine viel größere Solidarität mit Benachteiligten geben würde. Du kannst zu einhundert Prozent selbst entscheiden, was du mit deinem Geld machst und wirst nicht mehr unter dem Vorwand der Solidarität zwecks Umverteilung ausgeraubt.

Wichtig zu verstehen ist auch, dass in einer solchen kapitalistischen Gesellschaft Reichtum eine Belohnung für den Dienst an der Gesellschaft ist. Unternehmer versuchen, die künftigen Bedürfnisse ihrer Mitmenschen zu antizipieren. Besonders erfolgreiche Unternehmen sehen diese Bedürfnisse, bevor sich die Konsumenten selbst ihrer bewusst werden. Sie agieren dabei in Unsicherheit, denn Kosten ihrer Produktionsfaktoren entstehen in der Gegenwart, der Gewinn, wenn überhaupt, aber erst in der Zukunft.
Konsumenten steuern also die Produktion. Die Unternehmer sind jediglich die Befehlsempfänger, oder besser Befehlsvorausahner und setzen die Produktionsfaktoren tendenziell in der Produktion ein, die den Konsumenten am wichtigsten ist.

Nebenbei.. Wieso sollte ein Infrastrukturunternehmen sein kostbares Kapital in die Überwachung von Individuen investieren, wenn alles was man braucht um sicher zu sein, dass bezahlt wird ein Ticketschalter ist? Unverhältnismäßig viel Geld verlangen für eine Leistung kann auch Konsumenten abschrecken, was nicht erstrebenswert für ein Unternehmen ist! Big Brother ist nicht umsonst der fiktive Diktator eines Staates. Ein Unternehmen würde niemals Geld in ein so gewinnloses Unterfangen stecken. Aggression ist kostspielig! Es gibt dir vielleicht die Möglichkeit deine Daten als Tauschmittel zu benutzen, was ein Angebot ist, das abgelehnt werden kann. Der Staat kann ohne Aussicht auf Gewinn überwachen, denn er finanziert sich einfach durch Steuergelder. Wenn man verweigert das zu unterstützen wird man eingesperrt, denn er ist ja nicht nur Rechts- sondern auch Gewaltmonopolist.",null,0,null,1426802017,null,0,false,0,cpkcnxr,null,t3_2zgk8p,null,t1_cpkcnxr,null,t1_cpje3uk,null,null,null,1427862707,null,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1,null

&gt; Why would they add DRM if no one was pirating?

I guess what I'm saying is that it is 'victim blaming' in a way, of course piraters aren't really victims of anything, rather they can be pretty entitled at times, but it is still wrong to put the blame on those that didn't make the decision just because the decision wouldn't be made without them. I just don't think that because the decision was triggered by pirates it makes it any less idiotic. It is like a teacher that punishes the whole class when a few people are being obnoxious, which you could agree or disagree with.

&gt; I don't see your point in this thread?

You say that it is illegal and that it is theft, those aren't real arguments. The law is completely arbitrary, it is simply ink on paper. It is backwards to base what immoral on the law, because you base the law on what is immoral. Normally theft is immoral because you are taking away something that belongs to someone else and therefore causing them grief, but in a lot of times this is not the case with illegal downloading, because you are only producing a copy of a work. When no one is caused grief by illegal downloading, why do you think it is immoral?

Finns don't live in the US and aren't experiencing the war weariness of the US. For many Finns the US often seems a military power intervening with the internal affairs of other countries, and the US being a NATO country, by association people in the Middle East for example see the actions of US as actions of NATO and as such, they see NATO members as accomplices to US military action. I'm not saying this is rational thinking, but many Finns think that this association with US foreign policy is not good for our foreign policy.

A game can't demand anything. A game is just data, a sequence of bits. Only people who distribute it can demand something.

Most people do not hack the servers of the game developer to ""steal"" a copy of a game. They download it from other people, who put it on their websites, seed it through BitTorrent and so on and who are perfectly OK with others downloading it for free.

**(added)** In other words, the question is, ""Is it acceptable for two people to send data to each other, when some third party doesn't like it?"". Now the answer isn't as obvious, is it?

There is no difference.

Can't verify on this, but will bring you back to the argument : ""Even if they have, that does not give you the right to steal it on the internet. You have to watch it on those respective channels.""


&gt; I guess what I'm saying is that it is 'victim blaming' in a way, of course piraters aren't really victims of anything, rather they can be pretty entitled at times, but it is still wrong to put the blame on those that didn't make the decision just because the decision wouldn't be made without them. 



I don't understand any of this? Of course the pirates aren't the victims. They are the thieves that are stealing the property off others. When you illegally steal something on the internet, you are stealing property. Pure and simple. 


&gt; You say that it is illegal and that it is theft, those aren't real arguments.


Those are competently legitimate arguments. It has nothing to do with the law, but what is morally right and what should be the law. When you steal something that someone else has put forth on the internet for a price, you are robbing. It is not that hard to understand. 



&gt; When no one is caused grief by illegal downloading, why do you think it is immoral?

When the Troika was demanding the Greek government to follow a strict plan of action in order to tackle the problems at hand, the ball was very much in the Troika's court. The former Greek's government's lack of actions was a threat to the Troika's own program in the long-term. Thus why did they follow up with a second bailout if they objected to the lack of reform?

The problem is that none of it worked and all indications are that there was no serious intention for it to work. 

Tax evasion was quoted from the start as one of the main causes of the extent of deficits Greece was running, yet 5 years later it is still a problem. Even though at one point Europe had in its hand a list of undeclared Swiss bank accounts of the Greek elite - the Legarde list - that if accounted for would have single handedly condemned the culture of Greek tax evasion to extinction. And what eventually happened to the list brings us on to the second major thing the Troika failed to address.

Corruption. The Lagarde List, after being handed in confidence to the then Greek government, simply ""disappeared without trace"". A couple of years later a journalist reporting on the issue published the list and the response by the then Greek government was to try and both censure and arrest him. It was then that the the EU's impatience and the ECB's ultimatums should have come to roost. Yet nothing was done and nothing was demanded. Instead of punished, corruption was rewarded. 

If the Troika truly didn't intend direct control of the situation, it would similarly not have intervened against SYRIZA. And on the other hand the Greeks would have very much tolerated a Troika that produced results; they elected a pro-Troika government in the past after all. 

The problem is that the Greeks have little patience for a Troika that directed Greek finances for half a decade and yet the nation is still plagued by the same problems that condemned Greece to the abyss.

&gt; There's everything controversial about people telling other people tp leave a country they want changed.

To change a country you entirely hate (not for its government, but for its own sake), you'd have to entirely change the core of the country or its people. Or you could just hop over the border to a country that's already entirely different. There's 200+ of those entirely different countries in this world of ours to pick and choose from. It's the difference between wanting to impose your will on 60+ million people or putting some effort into leaving a country that already irritates you.

Some refer to operations that in some cases involve countries not publicly allied with the United States.

&gt;In one case, for instance, the files contain information about a program run from a NATO country against Russia that provides valuable intelligence for the U.S. Air Force and Navy, said one U.S. official, who requested anonymity to discuss an ongoing criminal investigation. Snowden faces theft and espionage charges.

&gt;“If the Russians knew about it, it wouldn’t be hard for them to take appropriate measures to put a stop to it,” the official said.

Poland had received a guarantee from France that this would happen, and structured its defenses around this guarantee: intending to hold out for the necessary time until the other Allies could join the conflict, and Germany would be overwhelmed.

Yes, there were reasons not to do so: the Allied militaries were not yet supplied and equipped to the level that their respective military leaders wanted...but that will always be the case, and is doubtless the case today.

Finland's own defense relies upon similar expectations: holding out long enough for sufficient allied support to be brought to bear, rather than being left in isolation.  Hence the concern: will allied nations respond, jumping into a war that they may not have been ready for that their own citizenry may not see the need for?

Consequently the war would be dictated on the ground and only soft equipment; infantry, engineers, specialised equipment (such as AT and AA) and logistics, would influence the course of Russian offensive failure or success. 

Luckily the Baltics on the whole seem to recognise that and focus accordingly. Hence money is better spent expanding those assets to enable a degree of depth in defence, to modernise existing equipment and achieve a reasonable degree of combat readiness.

I'm not against privatisations, to be honest I am supporter, but I'm for the process which is **inversely proportional** to what we have got.

All of our public companies were privatized on the same principles: in longlasting campaigns where companies values were first decimated with criminal and corruption and then bought by pawns to continue ruin them to the level when Hypo-Alpe Adria Bank and other ""domestic, but foreign"" criminals took over.

Since the number of international students is increasing, teaching in English becomes more common though. If you have a specific university in mind already, check their homepage.

For studying here you need a General Qualification for University Entrance, comparable to A-levels. Certain universities also do entrance tests or want a special application, have different language requests and so on. There are also subjects which have an entrance limitation, so you might need the right grades.

C'mon, let's start talking seriously - let's start talking about the things that should be changed (such as a more globally-engaged European civilian actor, closing Guantanamo, or Palestinian statehood), as opposed to the majority of the way things in the US-led international system are which we should be grateful for every day.

Nooo... just no. Ukraine's economy is indeed in a *really* bad situation due to its very poor management in the last decades combined with the current war.

Non seulement je suis une formation approfondie en combat à mains nues, mais j'ai accès à tout l'arsenal du 2e Régiment d'Infanterie de Marine et je vais l'utiliser à sa pleine mesure pour essuyer ton cul misérable de la surface du continent, petite merde.

No you are stealing, since yo don't pay for it. If I copy the a video game, does that make me the owner of the game? No it does not.



&gt; It is not the same as stealing from a store as there is only a potential loss of a sale.



Yes it is. A theft is a loss of sale. Read further further below. 


&gt; I agree that downloading illegally instead of buying is wrong, but I think it is perfectly acceptable to download when you wouldn't have access to it and bought it otherwise.



""I think it is a right to steal a Ferrari, since I would never have had the money to buy it.""


&gt; Question still stands, you need to argue why you're opposed to downloading illegally when no one is losing potential sales.



You do lose sales when people steal your property. And even if you don't, you still don't have the right to steal. Just because I would never have bought a merchandise, does not give me the right to steal it.

Nein. In einer solchen Gesellschaft wäre jeder Quadratmillimeter an Grund und Boden privatisiert. Nichts hält den Besitzer davon ab, für das Betreten seines Grund und Bodens eine Gebühr zu verlangen. Ich sage nicht das alles teurer wird, ich sage das man nur sehr viel mehr Gebühren (oder wie auch immer man es bezeichnen will) für das benutzen einer Infrastruktur und ebenso für das alleinige betreten eines Grundstückes zahlen müssen wird. 

&gt;Wichtig zu verstehen ist auch, dass in einer solchen kapitalistischen Gesellschaft Reichtum eine Belohnung für den Dienst an der Gesellschaft ist.

Wie möchtest du denn diese Belohnung fair verteilen, wenn du dich entschieden gegen Umverteilung einsetzt? Um Reichtum als Belohnung gelten zu lassen, müssten in deiner Gesellschaft alle(!) mit den absolut gleichen Mengen an Geld, Grundstücken, Boden sowieso Produktionsgütern starten. Da du aber entschieden gegen eine Umverteilung eintrittst, da es ja ein Raub sei, gäbe es auch diese Gleichverteilung nicht. Wenn wir also annehmen, das wir morgen in einer anarcho-kapitalistischen Gesellschaft aufwachen, säßen genau die selben Menschen auf dem großen Kapital, ohne dieses irgendwie durch ihren Dienst an der Gesellschaft verdient zu haben. 

&gt;Anarcho-Kapitalismus bedeutet nicht Rechtsfreiheit, sondern eine Privatisierung aller Güter, auch den Rechts- und Sicherheitsprodukten, für welche der Staat bisher das Monopol beansprucht. Er führt in eine Privatrechtsgesellschaft ohne Staat (für genauere Ausführungen vielleicht einfach mal googlen, kann das jetzt nicht alles ausführen, bitte um Verständnis).

was dazu führen würde, das zahllose Sicherheitdienste, alternativ könnte man sie auch einfach Söldner nennen, aus dem Boden sprießen und von unterschiedlichen Menschen, Unternehmen, Kapitalisten damit beauftragt werden, auf dem Land für Sicherheit zu sorgen und die Produktionsmittel sowie das Privateigentum zu schützen. Man muss kein Hellseher sein um zu sehen, was dann passieren würde (Somalia ab 1991). 

&gt;Nebenbei.. Wieso sollte ein Infrastrukturunternehmen sein kostbares Kapital in die Überwachung von Individuen investieren, wenn alles was man braucht um sicher zu sein, dass bezahlt wird ein Ticketschalter ist? 

Nun, da solltest du am besten Murray Rothbard fragen, der das ganze für eine gute Idee hielt: 
""[i]t should be pointed out that modern technology makes even more feasible the collection and dissemination of information about people's credit ratings and records of keeping or violating their contracts or arbitration agreements. Presumably, an anarchist [sic!] society would see the expansion of this sort of dissemination of data.""

&gt;Freiheit bedeutet nicht Kostenfreiheit. 

Freiheit, die du meinst. Wie schon in einem anderen Beitrag erwähnt, ist ein Mehr an Freiheit in deinem System nur für die Reichen gegeben. Und eben nicht für die Armen. Diese Scheinfreiheit, das jeder mit seinem Geld anfangen kann, was er will, scheitert doch schon an ganz grundsätzlichem, wie das Bezahlen der Infrastruktur oder das betreten eines fremden Rasens. 

Ganz zu schweigen von der Freiheit der Rede, die auch nur solange gegeben ist, wie der Besitzer des Grundes auf dem ich stehe, und gegen das System agitiere, davon genug hat und mir das verbietet, was er ja dürfte, da ich auf seinem Eigentum stehe. 

Oder der Reisefreiheit, die auch nur gegeben ist, so lange ich es mir leisten kann die Gebühren für die Benutzung der Straßen und Wege zu bezahlen.

The Dutch perpetuated their reputation for quaintness on Wednesday by holding national waterschapsverkiezingen (“water-scape elections”), choosing administrators for the dikes and canals that prevent their low-lying country from sinking into a swampy morass. They also voted for the country’s provincial assemblies, and that election threatens to drag the country into a different sort of morass. In the provincial assemblies, which choose the country’s senate, the six largest parties each received between 10% and 16% of the vote. This splintering of the senate may make it impossible for the centrist government to get anything done. Like voters across much of Europe, the Dutch are turning away from the traditional parties of power, and creating an ever more complicated political landscape.

The Dutch case is especially confusing because, while voters have turned against the government, they have not actually turned to the right or left. Since 2012 the Netherlands has been ruled by a grand coalition of the **centre-right** Liberals and the centre-left Labour Party. The government never had a majority in the senate, and to get its programme passed it has allied with three other parties, each of which demanded concessions. It has pushed through ambitious housing reforms and deficit-cutting measures, but those measures have not been popular, even among its own voters. Liberal voters have had to swallow excise tax hikes. Labour voters feel their party is implementing the austerity policies of the right. A stagnant economy and high unemployment have not helped.

Because the government is centrist, opposition to its policies has scattered voters in every direction. Both parties were punished on Wednesday, but Labour was hit hardest. The changes will not be official until the provincial assembly deputies vote in May, but based on the election results, Labour will drop from 14 seats to just eight in the 75-seat senate. The Liberals remain the largest party, but will fall from 16 seats to 13. The biggest winners were the centre-right Christian Democrats, who will have 12 seats, and the **left-liberal** D66 party, who will go from five to 10. There was less action on the fringes. The **far-right** Party for Freedom of Geert Wilders dropped from 10 senators to nine, while the **far-left** Socialist Party rose from eight to nine.

That only accounts for the top six of the 12 parties. Among the smaller ones, GreenLeft lost a senator, the Party for the Animals won one, and the more religious Christian parties did well. The fact that the unapologetically left-wing Socialists have outpaced centrist Labour, for the first time, is seen as significant. But for the most part, Dutch voters voiced their discontent with the centrist government by voting for the centrist opposition.

The next big step on the government’s agenda is tax reform. Labour and the Liberals both want to reward work by cutting the Netherlands' high income tax rates, which currently reach 42% for those earning €33,589 ($35,922) per year, and 52% for those making €57,585 or more. But it is hard to see how the government can put together a majority in the senate. Mark Rutte, the prime minister, optimistically predicted that the splintering of the senate means that “every party must take responsibility” for helping to pass legislation. But both D66 and the Christian Democrats can now ""make or break any deal"", says André Krouwel, a political analyst. While D66 has worked with the government, the Christian Democrats have refused to.

Much of the voters’ frustration stems from austerity measures the government has enacted over the past two years, such as cuts in health benefits and hikes in excise taxes. But the elections have actually strengthened the political forces demanding austerity. Both D66 and the Christian Democrats insist that the government commit in advance to new deficit-cutting measures to balance out any tax cuts. That is anathema to Labour.

The Liberals and Labour may yet manage to cobble together temporary alliances of other parties to push bills through. Meanwhile, the economy is improving; the official government forecaster predicts 1.7% growth this year, and consumer sentiment has turned positive for the first time since 2007. If the senate grinds to a halt, the improving economy could tempt the government (particularly the less unpopular Liberals) to take its chances on new elections to the lower house of parliament.

If anything in the 21st Century it is too easy to overestimate the role of national government, when one takes into account that the bulk of corruption is internationalised, not nationalised. After all a rich tax evader is nothing without his Swiss bank account and a corrupt official nothing without a few expected favours from fellow European officials. European nations could have employed policies on their part to make corruption in Greece at a high level literally unsustainable without having to substitute the Greek government as you seem to suggest; by ensuring that corruption in Greece couldn't merely be outsourced to EU member states to evade domestic prosecution and throughout the years they had several austerity and reform packages that could have at any time been withheld if progress in fighting corruption was inadequate (and [year](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/complicit-in-corruption-how-german-companies-bribed-their-way-to-greek-deals-a-693973.html) after [year](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2014/02/corruption-greece) after [year](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/03/greece-corruption-alive-and-well) there was every indication that it was)

**Long version:**

In some way this is the next step of a cultural (I think?) evolution.

Let me give you an example. In the Middle Ages (after 1000, possibly earlier but we don't have any solid data for the period before) the area covered by Romania was mostly inhabited by the Orthodox Christian speakers of a Romance language, culturally very similar. Yet it took them 700+ years to understand that they're 1 people, before that they were scattered in 2 independent/autonomous states (Wallachia and Moldavia) and 1 province of another country (Transylvania -&gt; Hungary). So once nationalism arrived in the 1800s they figure out that they're just 1 people and started calling each other by their common name, Romanians, instead of the regional ones such as Moldavian or Transylvanian. As far as I know the endonym was always ""Romanian"" and the exonym for all of them always was ""Vlach"".

The same thing happened in Germany or Italy (same time as us) or Spain or France (earlier).

So the EU is a sort of logical evolution of this. After killing each other in 2 world wars, people understood that maybe they're not that different and that they should cooperate.",null,0,null,1426808491,null,0,1426841908,0,cpkgd3m,null,t3_2zmqp2,null,t1_cpkgd3m,null,t3_2zmqp2,null,null,null,1427864432,null,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15,null

It is not a ""back and forth"". You either choose to pay or you don't. If the content creator demands a price for his content or he chooses for it to be free, you simply need to adhere to his request. You are not simply free to download it, because you find it convenient.

Different kind of copyright law. Your example would be infringing on an IP, where we are talking about illegally downloading something protected by a copyrighted IP. 


&gt; No, I want content creators to be paid for their work in some way that isn't as fucked up as what we have now. Content creators definitely must be compensated for their contribution to the world's culture, but when you retain complete ownership of something, by definition, you haven't contributed anything.



Are you some kind of radical? How can you argue that selling a video game or movie is part of ""the world culture""? If I release a video game, should it be copyrighted to me, or the ""world culture""? by your standards?

With regard to buying a car and driving a car in Rome, I would first consider the following: how often do you plan to use that car? 

Consider the following: finding a parking spot in Rome is one of the things that make people really feel miserable, it is a royal pain and is also rather expensive. Moreover, you will not feel comfortable driving in Rome if you come from a small city, as traffic is the number one complaint from commuters after parking, not mentioning scooters popping up from everywhere and reckless drivers. We are used to that, but many are not.

Consider you may also be able to use the Car2go on-the-spot car sharing scheme, pay as you go. It is certainly more expensive than having a car, but only if you plan to commute. with it. It is perfect for really occasional driving (fuel included, parking included, insurance included etc) and the Smart car they use is loved by Romans as it can be squeezed in a parking spot in the most illegal of manners (just look at how many Smart are parked in Rome, perpendicular to the street).

As you wife is going to spend quite some time at the AmUniv, you probably should consider finding a place that is relatively close to the Univ as that will save you a lot of commuting time. The only reliable public transportation in Rome is the the underground and, unfortunately, it is not close to the Univ. Surface buses are barely ok, but usually do not follow any reliable schedule or timetable, so you must take that into account when calculating how much time per day you want to spend commuting. With regard to 500...well it is too lovely a car to drive in Rome. If you really are considering buying a car, get one you can throw away without thinking twice about it, because it will get scratched if you are lucky, or somebody will bump into it when parking. No, they will not leave you a note.

With regard to renting a room in Rome, consider there are plenty of illegal accomodations being offered to any university students, so be careful.

It had its centre in Liège and was then starting to spread out to Southwest Germany. Several small iron smelting sites were set up there in the 17th and 18th century. For me, this surname, which our  family always kept spelling the French way (accent and all) has always been a reminder that European migration is not only a contemporary phenomenon, and that we do have shared histories.

&gt; But forgive for admitting to the crime of voting for the VVD: apparantly that makes every argument against the Senate directly influenced by party politics.

Two years before Maidan, the EU parliament was approving resolutions, concerned with the rise of the far right and in particular svoboda, and voicing its disapproval for potential coalitions with this party. Come Maidan, and suddenly it wasn't much of an issue any more. 

They could and should have also been louder in their concern for the non-representativeness of the Maidan movement, and remind Ukrainans that the East's will also need to be respected as well, as does due process. I understand they did pull out a deal for early elections, which embodies the position above. But they should have been loud about it, and from early on. 


Likewise when Yatsenyuk and friends came up with proposals to criminalise dual citizenship, and well as making Ukrainian the sole official language, again disapproval from the EU should have been way louder. 

Summarising, the EU should have been talking (also) to East Ukraine, and they weren't.

Yeah, I don't think any of us will change opinions...

&gt; If so, you are a tjief., Plain and simple. If does not matter how you presenbt your argument.

Yes, if you define theft as the unlawful taking of the property of another. No, if you define theft as the dishonest taking of property belonging to another person with the intention of depriving the owner permanently of its possession or larceny.
Also we have a fundamental disagreement here, as I have no such ultimatum.

And this is still just definitions, law. Ink on paper kinda stuff. I say even theft doesn't have to be immoral. I guess you didn't cheer for Robin Hood?

&gt; If you are not ""okay"" with the ""Terms of service"", you are free to not get the product. YOU DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO A PRODUCT! you have the right to refer from buying it, but digital products are not a human right.

I didn't say I have a right to it. In practice though, I pay my license to SVT which SVT used to buy the license for the show. My money is already in HBO's hands. SVT and HBO doesn't give a fuck what I do in the privacy of my own home, and like I said I already gave them my money. Why in the world would pirating the show be immoral in this situation? It makes no difference for me, HBO, or SVT. Yes, the Terms and Conditions probably said I am not allowed to do that but it makes no difference for all of the parties involved, except for me who gets to watch the show.

&gt; No you are stealing, since yo don't pay for it. If I copy the a video game, does that make me the owner of the game? No it does not.

If you borrow a game does that make you its owner? Sony has even made videos for the PS4 encouraging borrowing games, so clearly you have the 'right' to borrow games for the PS4. But what if you illegally download to same extent that you would borrow games? That is robbery and theft and you don't have the right to do that I guess? So here the method of distribution determines whether something is immoral or not, this is not a practical view point you have to admit.

**TL;DR** Our fundamental disagreement is that you say that the method of distribution matters, and that if you use channels that the law or terms and conditions don't give you the right to use, you commit theft, and theft is immoral. And I say that it doesn't matter if the end result is the same or if no sale is lost.

In some cases, this ambiguity is not simply benign, as it sometimes makes Europeans who are not part of the European Union or are not ideological supporters of European integration feel excluded. 

Here is a relatively minor personal anecdote that may help explain what I mean. I was flying from out of France and on passing to immigration control there were two lines one for European citizens and one for everyone else. There was a lady directing people where to go and she asked innocently: 
&gt;Êtes-vous européen?

For some reason this utterly incensed me momentarily. Yes, of course I am European, but answering the question affirmatively would have been the wrong answer here. For a second I felt the impulse to shout defiantly:
&gt;Da... KURVO 

before I realized that would be both counterproductive and unfair since she really hadn't meant anything bad in asking the question, she just made the mistake of simply equating European citizenship with Europeanness as she had been conditioned all her life when say traveling to Belgium, going to Germany for Erasmus, voting in European elections, etc. etc. However, such interactions have unfortunately made many, myself to some extent included simply feel more alienated as though my Europeanness was somehow not genuine enough because I am not *that kind of European.* Because of this I am increasingly reluctant to self-identify as European, whatever the factual geographic reality may be.

Yeah, ""far left"" is a bit of a stretch for the SP, which represents more an old-fashioned kind of social democracy than anything else (and there ain't nothing wrong with that). Syriza they're not. But the others aren't all that controversial:

* Calling D66 ""left-liberal"" is just a literal translation of the ""links-liberaal"" label D66 traditionally had. Yeah, it's outdated -- over the last decade, the party has moved right on economic policy &amp; I would now call it center-right rather than center-left; but it's a traditional label for the party so it's not that surprising to see it used.

* Describing the VVD as ""centre-right"" is also not that far off. Sure, I'd just call it a right-wing party, but that's in the context of Dutch politics. From an international view point, the secular nature of the party and the progressive stands it has taken over time on cultural issues like gay rights makes it hard to simply call the party ""right-wing"" or ""conservative"". It's not like Spain's PP, Poland's PiS or even Germany's CDU after all - let alone the Republicans in the US (and many of the Economist's online readers will be American).

* Describing the Freedom Party as ""far right"" shouldn't really be very controversial either, at least not outside Holland. I mean, Wilders was ready to ally with Marine Le Pen. ""Far-right"", in the international and European contexts, connotates with anti-immigration and anti-Islam rhetorics, with nationalism and xenophobia. The economic policies of far-right parties, which usually occupy some kind of populist center-ground whether you talk about France's Front National or Hungary's Jobbik, are secondary to this defining element of their profile. The definitions about what's left-wing and what's right-wing aren't only about economic policy after all, that's just one axis - usually the most important one, but not always.

But in that moment, the culture beaming to us from the states took on a kind of panicked fearful change, and the rhetoric moved to grand gestures and chest thumping ""MURICA!"" type patriotic backlashing. In Europe, to some extent all of our societies were already intimately accustomed to the shock of bombings, full scale invasions and human inflicted tragedies. There isn't anyone in Ireland (my home country) who doesn't know someone killed or involved in the troubles in Northern Ireland for example. There was a reaction from the US that clashed with the kind of solemn acceptance and getting on with it that Europeans are accustomed to. In London, in the aftermath of the 2005 bombings, there was a determined stiff upper lip, a commitment to change nothing in response to the attacks. The government at the time was well into America's middle east crusade, but the people responded as they always have in the face of the London Blitz, IRA bombings, they did their best to ignore it and cast a mild scorn on the perpetrators.

The rhetoric at the time was insane anyway, you had a US president invoking god's blessings on a war they launched in a snap reaction, casting a fight between good and evil, and his personal crusade to expose and punish anyone he could blame for what happened.

The fact is Georgia can't do anything to stop it, but Russia likely won't go further than that. It is close enough to keep Georgia nervous, as an invasion from South Ossetia can reach Gori (an hours drive from the capital Tbilisi) and cut off the country in minutes (Gori is about 2km from Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia; you can see the Russian base with binoculars in Gori).

You know clearly that Baltics are small nations (under 1 million people) and poor so they can't build up massive stuff or Air-Force so they did the best thing when they joined NATO when they finally get their freedom back.

Finns should have done the same thing, now we are facing a war and people are getting divided of the NATO question because the Finlandization still works strong.

Finland is a security threat to whole Europe atm and should get to NATO ASAP.

They'd be perfectly happy to see that measure in place, but not as an undiscussed surprise. If they say they support such an objective, they mean they're not going to oppose it if it's discussed with them - but they are going to oppose Greece doing it without discussion. There's no doublespeak in that - it's like saying you're perfectly amenable to having a party at your place, but not to coming home from work to discover that there's one in full swing which nobody bothered to discuss with you.

Mostly, all I can really do here is repeat the point again, that Greece have agreed to discuss and agree measures taken with the people lending them money. They didn't do so about this measure, and that has generated criticism from the people lending them money. The criticism is not of the measure itself, but of the way it's been taken.

I don't see the measure itself as something that, because it's a good measure, allows Greece to ignore that they're funding the measure with other people's money, without checking it with those people, as they had agreed to do. You don't see that as a problem, fair enough, but I would have said it's clear that taking the path of excusing this particular action, and then that particular action, and then this further action - all maybe good actions in themselves - is a path which leads to places Greece claims it doesn't want to go.

&gt;**the** up and coming Super Power

&gt;**the** dominant Super Power

Today's unipolar world dominated by a single hegemonic power is unusual. You keep saying ""the"" superpower as if that's how things normally are and the idea of having more than one competing power (albeit not necessary superpowers) is an up-and-coming thing. 

Two superpowers spent a great deal of the last century vying for dominance, even, so it's not as if it's been a long time since this was the case (you may well have even been alive then!)

A lot of the developing world's rapid growth is because of exactly that: they're *developing*. Countries like India and China that were recently significantly less developed than Western powers are catching up rapidly, but to expect that trend to continue at the same rate when they *do* catch up is pretty silly. A reasonable assumption is that their growth will slow and that they'll become great powers (or potentially superpowers), but it's not reasonable to assume the world will ""pivot"" all the way to Asia.

The Euro got me more interested in European matters, and moving around using the same currency created some sort of connection. 

Being our neighbours, we all felt for Spain during the attacks. That felt close regardless of an European feeling. The next year the London attacks happened. By then I had spent a fair amount of time in England, plus being similar to the Madrid attacks it brought back those feelings. The two countries I was more in contact with had been attacked. 

Then moved to the UK, where I met people from all over the world, and in particular many Europeans. I also hosted people and travelled around. It becomes evident that (generally speaking) we have many common experiences. 

The intersection is not always the same, but a pattern emerges. Could be actually knowing basic European geography, some intersection of knowledge of politics from Europe, possibly using Euro, having felt the effect of the Madrid/London attacks, watching the Eurocup, watching Eurovision, interest in European cuisine...

null,false,newappeal,advanced-english,advanced (native English),null,"&gt;Encountered a sentence today: Do you still live there? I translated it to be: Leben Sie noch da. It should have been Leben Sie noch dort. Why?

I could be totally off-base here, but I honestly think your attempt was correct. ""dort"" works too, but in this case there's not enough context to point to one or the other. The distinction I originally learned was that ""da"" is ""right there"" or ""there"" in a general sense, whereas ""dort"" is ""(over) there in that place"". So in your example, if you're speaking of some people in another town, ""dort"" might be your best bet, but if you're pointing at their home across the street and saying they live there, I would go with ""da"". (Consider when you hear a knock at the door, you say, ""Ist jemand da?"" and not ""Ist jemand dort?"")

&gt;Also, when do you use 'zu' before the infinitive at the end of a sentence?

This has a very complex answer. The short answer is when a verb can take an infinitive object and is not an auxiliary verb like ""können"", ""wollen"", etc, or with certain adjectives (e.g. ""easy to believe""). The long answer is an entire lesson, although perhaps someone with some more time can provide a more complex answer. However, an example is easier to deal with:

&gt;Ex: Ich gehe manchmal dort schwimmen. Not: Ich gehe manchmal dort zu schwimmen.

I think you're confused here, since ""gehen"" can take simple infinitives despite the fact that it's not an auxiliary verb, like in English. Consider the English translation ""I sometimes go swimming there""--same deal here. You *could* use ""zu"" in this sentence, but with a slightly different meaning, and only in a specific way: ""Ich gehe manchmal dorthin, um zu schwimmen"" - ""I sometimes to there [in order] to swim."" Note the ""um ... zu ..."" construction, which means ""in order to"".

Interessanterweise ist, ohne Staatszulagen, seine Bemerkung bzgl. Rechtsunsicherheit auch vollkommen irrelevant.

And from what little of your German you showed us there I can definitely say I've seen worse.:) Try your luck with the Landwirtschaftskammer - stress how exited and proud you all were to find out that your family emigrated from that super beautiful region in Northern Germany - appealing to their regional pride might do the trick. Best of luck in any case and as I said - I'm here to help if you get stuck, just shoot me a message. A couple of thoughts I had on the matter since yesterday: Shipping costs (at least DHL, but I don't think FedEx etc. will be a whole lot cheaper) would most likely be insane - I've spoken to a friend who works in DHL logistics and he told me that you'd be stuck with the express option in any case (snail mail cargo takes between 10 to 14 days from Germany to Iowa with no chance to water the plant while en route) which would cost at the very least (depending on size and weight of the parcel and where it is picked up from) around 200EUR. The tax and import procedure paperwork would come on top of that and needs to be supplied by you to the shipping company in any case. 
This may be a long shot, but if you happen to know (or get in constact with) someone currently serving in- or rotating out through Germany (or a spouse taking a commercial flight back to the US) who would be willing to take you seedling, I'm sure the Baumschule would ship it, packaging fit for a trip across the pond, to a German/base address for a lot less money.

If all else fails, as /r/DocTomoe rightly pointed out: Schehenlikör and Schlehenschnaps are a culinary specialty in several German regions. I personally only know the Schnaps (which is not a sweet schnapps in the American sense, but a clear, fruit brandy-type spirit) and that one is pretty tasty - if you've ever had European style plum brandy (not the sweet Asian style), they is roughly comparable in taste.
Since the Meldorf area is a tourist region, I'm pretty sure there will be regional producers of Schlehenlikör, -schnaps and most likely also -marmelade - it's usually artisans or even farmers' wives who produce small batches from hand-picked fruit during fall/winter and sell them on markets throughout the next year.
So if the tree doesn't work out and that might be an acceptable substitue, I'm sure you'll find some from the region. 
A quick google search only brough up [these guys](http://www.destillerie-gottesgabe.de/) who are located some 70 miles east (near Kiel), but do offer Schlehenlikör and -geist (Schnaps), for between 15 and 35 EUR a bottle, depending on size. I'm more of a Whiskey person myself, but the price seems pretty fair for the amount of work involved in production and given the fact that their destillery apparently won a couple of awards for several of their products. It also mirrors the prices of the few commercial producers of Schlehenschnaps my local Hamburg liquor store offers.
Lastly: Meldorf has a [tourist-office](http://www.echt-dithmarschen.de/poi/touristinformation-meldorf.html) who may or may not have some more ideas or sources for local Schlehen-related products and other cool stuff for a gift basket. If you're really lucky (and happen to know the church/birth register details of your emigré ancestors) they might even be able to track down the exact place where your family once lived and might get you pictures of what their house looks like today (many farms, for example, have been at the very same place for centuries). As someone whose family (at least partially) was, shall we say: 'involutarily emigrated' from their ancestral home 70 years ago but with no living grandparents to ever share stories from back then, I know firsthand how weird/interesting/exciting it is to get some tangible direct connection to your roots.

Lazy is for southern Europeans; conniving, rabid nationalists who are mentally stuck in another century is for the Balkans (especially Serbia and Orban-Hungary) and criminals, especially in regards of organized crime and large-scale burglary rings, is Bulgaria/Romania/gypsies. I'm referring to stereotypes here, of course.

As far as Poles are concerned, the last decade has seen their numbers in the nursing sector increase drastically, while we still get many polish seasonal workers in agriculture (at least in Northern Germany), so a somewhat more up to date stereotype is definitely the hard-working Pole (both, male and female) with a family back home that regularily receives part of the salary via wire transfer and gets visited regularily by bus.

Also: The stereotype of the handyman who is cheap/works under the table but does a good job and needs comparatively little oversight - especially compared to the new, cheap labor from even further east who do shoddy jobs, steal everything that isn't nailed down (especially on construction sites) and generally only take such jobs to case the place for a future visit of their burglary ring.

Stereotypes are very likely different in the border region, where you find this peculiar mix of people getting along great with their Polish neighbors in day-to-day life, but being utterly exasperated by the significant hike in *actual* car theft/ car break-ins since border controls were abolished.

Another observation: I find sentiment towards the Polish people (in regard to the degree of hostility in any negative sentiment generally) also somewhat dependent on the current sentiment of the Polish media/elites towards Germany. The switch from the Kaczynskis and their affiliates to more moderate people like Tusk has brought a tangible change.

Roughly 1000€ per month.

&gt; Are Germans pretty welcoming of internationals? Any trouble meeting new friends?

I can imagine that there might be problems because you don't speak German. But I don't have first-hand experience, since I'm native. The boyfriend of a friend of me is from Finland, though, and he is pretty much left out, if we ever met in a group.

- die Drohne fliegt ein Muster ab. Erste Telemetriedaten zeigen, dass der Nebel sehr dicht ist, die Sichweite gering und der allgemeine Verdruß auf den Straßen zunimmt. Meteoexperten sagen vorraus, dass der Verdruß bei zunehmender Annäherung an das Wochenende abnimmt.

C'est inefficace, c'est violent, et ça repose sur le contrôle physique d'un territoire et de ses frontières, mais jusqu'à récemment c'était la seule façon d'organiser le vivre-ensemble.

Internet rend caducs à la fois la capacité de contrôle des États dans beaucoup de domaines-clef, notamment économiques, et le besoin de hiérarchie bureaucratique pour s'organiser et vivre ensemble. Tout comme on n'a plus besoin de Vivendi-Universal qui presse des CD et les livre à la FNAC pour écouter de la musique, on perd le besoin d'organisation étatique dans de plus en plus de domaines. Les questions importantes se passent soit à l'échelle au-dessus (OMC, FMI, ONU, UE, traités imposés par les US) soit au dessous, à des niveaux locaux.

Donc c'est inévitable que les États façon XXe siecle luttent contre Internet comme les taxis luttent contre Über. Notre chance, c'est que les baby-boomers au contrôle de l'État ne comprennent profondément rien au Net. Le conflit se déclare avant que l'ennemi ne soit devenu compétent.

I'll quote what I wrote in response to u/shudders:

&gt;This might very well be the case - hence we need institutions which ensure that more of these interests align. Various regions in the US have different interests, yet they work together not only because it is more beneficial but because the framework they're operating in has altered their interests altogether.

&gt;Of course, if you're of the conviction that interests are some unchangable constant throughout the ages, this argument holds little sway. Since I'm not, I shall use it.

I believe that these institutions are realistic on a European level and even exist to some degree. If you don't like the word 'institution', you can also use framework or organisatorial principle. What I mean is a ""way to do things"". This is not without precedent in the international community (for example courts which settle economic disputes) but it does require, as always, the 'taking away of coercion' as a primary means to get things done. That's were a more integrated Europe comes into play.

&gt;Whenever the UK has a different view on the direction the EU should take it is rebuffed.

You shouldn't take r/europe's idiots to represent the EU Commission or national governments. The national leaders have clearly spoken *in favour* of keeping the UK within the EU. Especially the Scandinavians and some of the eastern Europeans see the UK as a very valuable ally within EU politics to counter the Franco-German axis. 

The trouble over the past years was that Mr Cameron deemed it fit to (AFAIK) alienate all possible allies by spouting rhetoric about loss of sovereignity and the evils of Brussels without making any constructive efforts to better it. Because yes, there is much work to do! And grand British visions are desperately needed. Instead, little England is preferred.

What I'd like to add is that sovereignity on paper is not de facto sovereignity. One would think this is obvious, but many people seem to conflate the two. Should Britain leave the EU, now or in the future, there is no guarantee that it will in fact be more sovereign. As a relatively tiny country it will have little say in big matters - don't fool yourself that a veto in an increasingly impotent UN or a nuclear arsenal during economic or cyber-wars will be of much use. This is why I support, to keep *the individual's* right of political self-determination, a European Union - Westminster might grow weaker, but you gain a voice in a Parliament which has the potential to become one of the strongest the world has ever seen.

A me non pare che in Italia ci sia un eccesso di garantismo. Piuttosto esiste un sistema duale: migliaia di scappatoie per chi sa sfruttarle, che si contrappongono a poteri della magistratura di fare spesso il cazzo che le pare (vedi carcerazione preventiva ad mentulam canis, intercettazioni che escono come se fossero copie di Leggo). Come per tante altre cose, a un'ingiustizia si risponde con altra ingiustizia.

&gt; Lupi non ha ancora ricevuto avvisi di garanzia né il suo nome è ancora nel registro ufficiale degli indagati, ciò non significa che quanto abbia fatto sia tuttora passato con la lente di ingrandimento per vedere se non ci siano responsabilità.

Le indagini son durate due anni e si sono concluse ora, diceva cokkish. Se così è sì, Lupi sarà anche stato passato al setaccio ma la magistratura ha deciso che non c'erano elementi per indagarlo.

&gt; Li considero colpevoli entrambi. Essere dei deficienti quando si occupa una posizione solo di potere è una colpa. Far finta di non vedere è una colpa, mancare ai propri doveri nei confronti del patrimonio pubblico, in questo caso, è una colpa.

Ma se vuoi dire che Lupi è colpevole di negligenza ma chitteferma, lo penso pure io.

Let me quote myself:

&gt;What I'd like to add is that sovereignity on paper is not de facto sovereignity. One would think this is obvious, but many people seem to conflate the two. Should Britain leave the EU, now or in the future, there is no guarantee that it will in fact be more sovereign. As a relatively tiny country it will have little say in big matters - don't fool yourself that a veto in an increasingly impotent UN or a nuclear arsenal during economic or cyber-wars will be of much use. This is why I support, to keep the individual's right of political self-determination, a European Union - Westminster might grow weaker, but you gain a voice in a Parliament which has the potential to become one of the strongest the world has ever seen.

Now on to your other issue.

&gt;We're watching how it is working out with the currency right now and its not pretty.

You seem to assume that an integrated Europe is something which must lead to a currency union over the next few decades. I do not think this is neccessary. In fact, I'm in favour of more political integration before anything as difficult as a currency union without a fiscal one is attempted. 

What underlies this is the idea that Europea can be integrated in layers, with varying speeds, each people according to its own wishes. Of course, this doesn't work if everybody wants their own special treatment with all things all the time. That's where politics comes into play.

&gt;No thanks, we don't want a union with your country

Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and ritual infanticide. The &lt;center&gt; cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty. If you parse HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous ways which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name cannot be expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes. HTML-plus-regexp will liquify the n​erves of the sentient whilst you observe, your psyche withering in the onslaught of horror. Rege̿̔̉x-based HTML parsers are the cancer that is killing StackOverflow it is too late it is too late we cannot be saved the trangession of a chi͡ld ensures regex will consume all living tissue (except for HTML which it cannot, as previously prophesied) dear lord help us how can anyone survive this scourge using regex to parse HTML has doomed humanity to an eternity of dread torture and security holes using regex as a tool to process HTML establishes a breach between this world and the dread realm of c͒ͪo͛ͫrrupt entities (like SGML entities, but more corrupt) a mere glimpse of the world of reg​ex parsers for HTML will ins​tantly transport a programmer's consciousness into a world of ceaseless screaming, he comes, the pestilent slithy regex-infection wil​l devour your HT​ML parser, application and existence for all time like Visual Basic only worse he comes he comes do not fi​ght he com̡e̶s, ̕h̵i​s un̨ho͞ly radiańcé destro҉ying all enli̍̈́̂̈́ghtenment, HTML tags lea͠ki̧n͘g fr̶ǫm ̡yo​͟ur eye͢s̸ ̛l̕ik͏e liq​uid pain, the song of re̸gular exp​ression parsing will exti​nguish the voices of mor​tal man from the sp​here I can see it can you see ̲͚̖͔̙î̩́t̲͎̩̱͔́̋̀ it is beautiful t​he final snuffing of the lie​s of Man ALL IS LOŚ͖̩͇̗̪̏̈́T ALL I​S LOST the pon̷y he comes he c̶̮omes he comes the ich​or permeates all MY FACE MY FACE ᵒh god no NO NOO̼O​O NΘ stop the an​*̶͑̾̾​̅ͫ͏̙̤g͇̫͛͆̾ͫ̑͆l͖͉̗̩̳̟̍ͫͥͨe̠̅s ͎a̧͈͖r̽̾̈́͒͑e n​ot rè̑ͧ̌aͨl̘̝̙̃ͤ͂̾̆ ZA̡͊͠͝LGΌ ISͮ̂҉̯͈͕̹̘̱ TO͇̹̺ͅƝ̴ȳ̳ TH̘Ë͖́̉ ͠P̯͍̭O̚​N̐Y̡ H̸̡̪̯ͨ͊̽̅̾̎Ȩ̬̩̾͛ͪ̈́̀́͘ ̶̧̨̱̹̭̯ͧ̾ͬC̷̙̲̝͖ͭ̏ͥͮ͟Oͮ͏̮̪̝͍M̲̖͊̒ͪͩͬ̚̚͜Ȇ̴̟̟͙̞ͩ͌͝S̨̥̫͎̭ͯ̿̔̀ͅ

Une équipe de l'armée américaine découvre, piégé dans la glace de l'Arctique, une série d'artefacts d'origine inconnue dont certains ouvrent des portails vers des univers non-explorés. Sentant une opportunité de doubler l'URSS, les américains dépensent des fortunes pour exploiter ces artefacts et découvrent qu'ils sont liés à des entités inconnues, d'une puissance inimaginable, qui seraient en hibernation sur Terre. Et les Soviets sont en train d'essayer d'en réveiller une...

A Colder War est paru dans **The Book of Cthulhu**, une collection de nouvelles dans le style de Lovecraft (mais pas forcément liées explicitement au mythos). Tous les textes sont modernes et ne souffrent pas des problèmes de syntaxe ou de vieillissement du style lovecraftien.

Trouvez-le en ebook.

Dans les nouvelles, je recommande particulièrement **Shoggoths in Bloom**, une nouvelle dans laquelle les shoggoths se sont échappés d'Antarctique et sont devenus des animaux normaux à l'époque humaine. **Than Curse the Darkness**, une expédition d'un groupe d'occidentaux sur les rives du fleuve Congo à l'époque coloniale à la recherche d'un culte étrange, et **Jeroboam Henley's Debt**, l'histoire d'un descendant d'esclaves que l'histoire sombre de ses ancêtres dans l'Afrique précoloniale finit par rattrapper.",null,0,null,1426838840,null,0,false,0,cpktfgr,null,t3_2zodbj,null,t1_cpktfgr,null,t3_2zodbj,null,null,null,1427870987,null,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2,null

And on top of that, no one ""dragged"" anyone into the Iraq War. The US made it clear that they were perfectly willing to fight by themselves, long before the war started. 

All allies that joined, did so of their own choosing.


And ""war weariness"", matters not when decisions are made to go to war. This is especially true in countries like the US that have an all volunteer military. If you don't want to fight in an offensive/preemptive/preventive war, then don't join the military. 



The oath soldiers in the US take, is to fight *all* enemies, foreign *and* domestic. *Whenever* the military tells you to. Regardless of you feeling ""weary"", ""tired"", ""sleepy"", or anything else.

Diese sind mir im Regelfall egal. Ab und an eignen sie sich allerdings als guter Indikator wer gerade unterwegs ist...

Btw:

&gt;&gt; The ""freeze peaches"" meme derives from their idea that only a government body can exact censorship. This is pervasive amongst practically all SJWs I've seen who talk about it and it seems to be a way of them telling themselves that they do support freedom of speech. That despite their flirtation and/or endorsement of no-platforming, mass boycotts/blocking, blacklists and public harassment and smearing of individuals and groups that they really do support free speech. They are wrong. Individuals can and do exhibit attitudes and beliefs that indicate a low opinion of free speech and they do so without any appeal to government. The threat of censorship these days doesn't come from government but from our peers.

&gt;&gt;The idea is held in relative cognitive dissonance as those same people often decry the effects of isolating the voices of ethnic and cultural minorities through micro-aggression and mockery.

&gt;  dein reflexhaftes ""religion ist doch firlefanz"" nichts mit der aktuellen diskussion zu tun hat

Ernsthaft? Ein ""Geistlicher"", also ein expliziter Propagandist einer Ideologie, die auf der Existenz und Unfehlbarkeit eines unsichtbaren, allmächtigen Weltenschöpfers beruht, stellt eine weitere Behauptung auf die ebenso unbeweisbar und naturwissenschaftlich abwegig ist wie die von ihm behaupteten Engel und Dämonen und es besteht dabei aus deiner Sicht kein Zusammenhang mit seinem zugrundeliegenden Weltbild?

&gt; nur jemanden angreift der seine perspektive zu diesem thema gegeben hat.

Worin soll der Angriff bestehen? Darin dass ich darauf hinweise, dass die eine Vorstellung naturwissenschaftlich nicht besser belegbar ist als die andere?

Wird eine solche Aussage automatisch zum *Angriff*, nur weil ich sie gegenüber jemanden tätige der sich dazu bekennt ebenfalls ein solches naturwissenschaftlich unbeweisbares, auf Mythen basierendes  Weltbild zu teilen?

&gt;Although Snowden obtained a large volume of documents, he is not believed to have shared all of them with journalists, sources say. Moreover, he has stressed to those he has given documents that he does not want harm to result.

&gt;“He’s made it quite clear that he was not going to compromise legitimate national intelligence and national security operations,” said Thomas Drake, a former NSA executive who visited Snowden in Moscow this month. Snowden separately told Drake and a New York Times reporter that he did not take any documents with him to Russia. “There’s a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents,” Snowden told the Times in an online interview last week.

&gt;Indeed, Drake said, Snowden made clear in their conversation that he had learned the lessons of prior disclosures, including those by an Army private who passed hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks, which posted them in bulk online. “It’s telling,” Drake said, “that he did not give anything to WikiLeaks.”

So on one hand you have the Polish guy, who seems to have stolen information for the express purpose of passing on that information to Russia. On the other you have Snowden, who pointedly did not make all the information public and passed information to journalists so they could tell everyone that electronic communication that they thought was private wasn't.

* Localization costs.  If your product has a non-English-only manual or interface, it will need to be localized for smaller markets.

* [Mains power frequency differences](http://sound.westhost.com/articles/50-60hz.htm): 
    &gt; Many products intended solely for the US markets will have the transformer made for 60Hz. This has the advantage of making the transformer smaller than it would be if it could also handle 50Hz. Indeed, an advantage of 60Hz mains is that all transformers and induction motors are smaller than the 50Hz equivalent. 

* For the UK, a unique plug.

* Import tariffs/lack of a free-trade agreement with the location that the product is coming from.  According to [*Cheapest countries for buying electronics gear*](http://www.priceoftravel.com/2357/cheapest-countries-for-buying-electronics-gear/), most of the difference is from VAT or duties.

* Representation of cost.  Be sure to factor in how the price is computed.  In the US, because the location of the buyer determines sales tax and this varies by state, an advertised price at, say, an online retailer will *not* include sales tax.  That may not be the case for European countries.

* Cost of transport.  A lot of consumer electronics are probably manufactured in East Asia, and transport will at at least a bit more-expensive to Italy than San Francisco.

WHEN Russia was preparing to annex Crimea a year ago its television broadcasts, portraying the protesters who had recently overthrown Ukraine’s regime as a neo-Nazi rabble, softened the peninsula’s defences as effectively as any artillery assault. One month later, when Russian-backed rebels overran Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, one of their first acts was to seize control of the television centre and replace Ukrainian broadcasts with previously banned Russian ones.

The Kremlin’s propaganda machine has been a key component of the “hybrid warfare” that Russia has waged in Ukraine, and has helped shore up Vladimir Putin’s support at home. But it spreads much further. It spills into east European countries via television services that offer viewers tasty blends of entertainment garnished with sprigs of fake news. It extends westward in the form of outfits like RT (formerly Russia Today), a Kremlin-backed news outfit which broadcasts in English, Spanish, French and German, or neatly designed supplements placed in the New York Times or Daily Telegraph. Sometimes it is smuggled directly into respectable domestic publications, as gullible or time-starved editors unknowingly reproduce Russian misinformation. Meanwhile Kremlin-backed trolls poison online discussion forums and social networks.

European Union
Countries in the front line of Moscow’s “weaponisation of information”, in the words of Peter Pomerantsev and Michael Weiss, two analysts, have long sought to draw attention to the problem. The European Union is at last listening. Heads of government, meeting in Brussels as we went to press, were expected to ask Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign-policy chief, to produce a plan to counter Russia’s “disinformation campaigns” by June. Before that the EU will launch a task force (working name: Mythbusters) charged with monitoring Russian media, identifying patent falsehoods and issuing corrections.

This is awkward terrain for Europe. It was hard enough to galvanise a collective response to Russia’s military adventurism; information warfare is a still murkier world. The challenges faced by Britain in countering RT’s misinformation are different from those in Baltic states with Russian-speaking minorities, or in war-torn Ukraine, subject of Russia’s most egregious lies. That the EU has belatedly been persuaded to act is progress. But officials stress that individual countries must do much of the work.

Some are pushing ahead: in September Estonia will launch a general television channel aimed at the quarter of its population who speak Russian first. Others have bigger ideas: Latvia, home to the EU’s largest Russian-speaking minority, has proposed publicly funded pan-Baltic channels. Some talk of trying to penetrate Russia’s tightly controlled media market. The Dutch government has financed the European Endowment for Democracy, a Brussels-based think-tank, to consider various proposals. Ms Mogherini will carefully read its report, due in May. But her team downplays ambitious calls for action: grand schemes that require grand funds are, mercifully, out of style in Brussels.

The ideas floated instead are sensible, if small: getting national media regulators to talk to each other, building networks of trusted journalists and, in countries at risk, supporting local producers of good journalism. One example often cited is Hromadske, an online Ukrainian TV channel that sprang out of Kiev’s Maidan protests. The EU will also try, somehow, to spread its own message better: Eurocrats admit they have been outgunned by Russia when it comes to explaining matters like free-trade deals.

Amid all this, one fear is of ham-fisted responses. The danger is greatest in Ukraine, where officials have harassed and deported Russian journalists and frustrated international reporters with their own obfuscations. The government is finalising plans for Ukraine Tomorrow, a channel designed to square up to RT that local journalists fear will descend to its standards. Elsewhere, too, there have been difficulties. Last year Latvia and Lithuania temporarily banned Russian broadcasters. In Britain RT has tangled with Ofcom, the media watchdog. Some want the EU to expand its visa-ban list to cover more moguls and journalists.

Russian outlets must abide by local laws, of course. But Europeans should be wary of handing Mr Putin easy propaganda wins. Up against lavishly financed Russian media, cash-strapped, fractious Europe will always struggle: one American official likens the battle to using a teaspoon to shovel out of a snowstorm. But European values like free speech and a commitment to truth remain potent, as Ukrainians know well. Europe’s best hope lies in loudly promoting them. If attempts to counter disinformation are to get anywhere, they must demonstrate the falsehood of the most brazen Russian proposition of all: that there is no truth in reporting, just a postmodern potpourri of perspectives.

Countering propaganda, not counter-propaganda
European officials insist they are not engaging Russia in a propaganda war. Good: pro-Europeans in Ukraine and elsewhere want an alternative to Mr Putin’s grubby tactics, not a European version of them. Yet just as it underestimated Russia’s military resolve in Ukraine, Europe risks underplaying the potency of the disinformation threat. Fact-checking and networking initiatives can carry you only so far; Europe must act as well as react.

Unwieldy bureaucracies like the EU have no business getting into public broadcasting. But individual countries do, and some are responding. Germany is boosting funding for Deutsche Welle, its public broadcaster. The Americans are spending more, and encouraging Europeans to do the same. The British picture is bleaker—facing a squeeze, the BBC World Service ended broadcasts in Ukrainian in 2011—but officials have at least woken up to the danger. Countering the storm of Russian propaganda will require innovative thinking as well as money, two resources in scarce supply in Europe. But it is worth giving truth a chance.

**GB:**

* Moltissimi musei sono gratis

* Hanno una maggiore cultura dei grandi spazi: ""Andiamo a farci una camminata di due giorni in collina"" non l'ho mai sentito in Italia.

* Non è un problema da carnarolo, ma la disponibilità -cercata- di opzioni vegetariane nel menù è di gran lunga maggiore (poi la qualità del cibo è n'altra roba)

* Gli spazi pubblici e le cose ""sharing economy"" funzionano meglio, tipo lo scambio gratis di libri o elettrodomestici vecchi

* Cè un'economia di oggetti di seconda mano MOLTO più grande: comprare libri, vestiti, elettrodomestici, utensili, posate, borse etc di seconda mano nei charity shop è comunissimo (e anche divertente)

**Italia (in specifico Udine)**

* Quello che mia mamma chiama ""Le finiture"" in casa. Cazzo, ogni anno gli stessi inverni freddi e piovosi, POSSIBILE che avete ancora i vetri singoli e i serramenti che non si chiudono?! La qualità della casa è di gran lunga maggiore in Italia

* Come detto da altri, la pulizia e cura della casa è di gran lunga maggiore in Italia. In casa dei miei si può operare, in certe case qua non serve disinfestare perchè i topi sono schifati.

* Arancini, piadina, pizza, mozzarella, la varietà di formaggi (non solo cheddar e stilton), musetto, gnocchi, scquacherone, lasagne, vino etc etc non sono delle cose esoteriche.

* A proposito di vino, non so fuori dal Friuli, ma a Udine un bicchiere costa 1 Euro, qua 5 sterline.

* Non è religione vomitare di alcool ogni venerdi o sabato sera. 

* Fra 20 minuti cè l'eclissi. La vedrò? Niet. Ho visto statistiche di pioggia media annuale e non è che in Inghilterra piova MOLTO di più, ma di sicuro si vede il sole di meno.

* Per stare sul meteo - avrò sentito un temporale con tuoni decenti una, forse due volte in GB. In Italia ogni estate mi ricredo sull'esistenza di Thor.

null,false,louisebeta,null,null,null,"Germania, UK

* Burocrazia. Kafkiana quella italiana, quella britannica quasi inesistente (ma si sta kafkanizzando anche li), quelle tedesca molto trasparente.
* Ciclabilità. In Germania un sogno. A Londra una guerra, ma il governo ci prova.
* Strade. I britannici sono maestri della segnaletica, i tedeschi le tengono bene. Le nostre hanno segnaletica scadente e sono in pessime condizioni
* Evasione fiscale e onestà. Ho avuto clienti da tutta Europa. Ho avuto solo due clienti italiani. Ho avuto solo due clienti che mi hanno chiesto di non fargli la fattura per non pagare le tasse. Indovinate di che nazione?
* Classe Politica. Per esempio i Verdi stavano volando nel UK al 10%, poi la leader ha fatto un'intervista in cui è risultata un po' cretina, risulato: i Verdi sono in caduta libera a 4%. Lo stesso è successo coi Piraten in Germania. L'idea di eleggere imbecilli gli fa venire gli incubi. Da noi invece gente come Razzi o Adinolfi diventano eroi popolari e riempono il parlamento
* Rivoluzionari. In Spagna hanno Podemos, in Grecia Tsipras (ok un coglione, ma almeno giovane) da noi i gggiovani anti-sistema credono alle scie kimiche e il loro leader è un fascistoide che veleggia per i 70 anni.
* Classe dirigente. Basta vedere come gente come Montezemolo salti di lavoro in lavoro o i famosi ""capitani coraggiosi"" che hanno ""salvato"" l'Alitalia, o lo stato del caclio per vedere come siamo messi male. 
* Sindacati. Quelli britannici spazzati via dalla Thatcher, ma quelli tedeschi fanno il loro lavoro come dovrebbero. In Italia si pigliano solo mazzette.
* Corruzione. Endemica in Italia. Non così endemica in altri paesi del nord Europa.
* Musica. Eccetto per la classica, la musica italiana fa abbastanza cagare. E anche la classica, trattasi di qualcosa che abbiamo ereditato più che merito degli italiani moderni)
* Televisione. Inarrivabile quella britannica. Normale quella tedesca. Da noi sembra ci siano soprattutto talkshow con gruppetti di uomini di mezza età che si gridano a vicenda.
* Arte moderna e Teatro. E i musei nel UK sono gratis.
* Internet. Connessioni più veloci, industria molto più sviluppata. A parte Arduino, l'industria informatica italiana è di serie B.
* Calcio. Abbiamo avuto 15 anni in cui eravamo dei, adesso siamo ridicoli.
* Cibo. Si mangia buon cibo di tutto il mondo nell'UK. E si mangia bene anche in Germania - e fanno cibo italiano buono in entrambi i paesi.
* Colazioni. La nostra colazione di caffèlatte e paste di produzione di massa non può battere una tedesca on un full English
* Trasporti pubblici - nell'UK fanno cagare anche più che in Italia, ma in Germania funzionano benissimo.
* Sanità. Non so da dove viene il mito che l'Italia abbia la miglior sanità d'Europa. Cagate. Molto meglio in Germania. Nell'UK però fa cagare, ma almeno li è tutta gratis.
* Business. Aprire una compagnia o fare business è un gioco da ragazzi nell'UK, e non troppo difficile in Germania. In Italia un incubo.
* Esercito. Il nostro esercito è ridicolo. Anche quello tedesco, ma quell0 britannico è uno dei migliori.
* Degrado ambientale. Non mi sembra UK o DE abbiano la Terra Dei Fuochi.
* Mafia. Say no more.
* Carattere. I tedeschi sono puntuali, socievoli e ti dicono le cose in faccia. I britannici sono simpatici e odiano perdersi in chiacchere. Gli italiani si perdono sempre in chiacchiere e sono fondamentalmente  disonesti, amanti del mobbing e macchiavellisti. Ma sono molto socievoli.
* Uguaglianza tra i sessi. Imbarazzante in Italia (dove tutte le politiche donne, da Idem a Kyenge a Fornero a Boldrini sono soggette a pesantissimi attacchi personali che gli uomini non si beccano)
* Monumenti e turismo. Per noi i turisti sono qualcosa da pelare, e i nostri monumenti li lasciamo degradare.
* Giornalismo. Il giornalismo italiano fa cagare, opinioni mischiate a fatti senza mai citare fonti.
* Mi son stufato, ma la lista continuerebbe...

Italia

* Si mangia bene - non così meglio degli altri paesi come una volta, ma bene. E NON è a buon mercato, almeno non al nord.
* Fumetti.
* Vino e Olio di oliva
* aperitivo. 
* Ci sono molti bei monumenti di secoli fa, cosa di cui però noi italiani moderni non abbiamo nessun merito, anzi
* In terronia il clima è mite e si può fare il bagno nel mare (ma i tedeschi hanno i laghi)

null,false,zoheirleet,null,null,null,"&gt;  Thomas Piketty principalement, même si mes profs, Aurélie Trouvé au premier plan, semblent aussi penser qu'en effet l'écart entre les pauvres et les riches s’accroît. Il faudrait réformer l’impôt pour le rendre plus progressif, ce qui signifie la fin des paliers et une augmentation substantielle des prélèvements pour la partie aisée de la population et sans doute aussi pour une partie de la classe moyenne, bien que plus faible. Il faudrait aussi sans doute augmenter les prélèvements sur héritage de manière conséquente, car c'est une source importante d'inégalités.

Piketty a bossé avec des parlementaires sur une refonte de l'impot républicain: progressif et égalitaire. Elargir l'assiette d'impots ainsi que la fin de nombreuses niches fiscales. De plus Piketty plaide pour un impot mondial (voire déjà européen) sur les entreprises (afin de contrer les evasions fiscales au Lux/Irelande/Pays-Bas/...). Je n'ai jamais lu pour le moment que cela augmentera de maniere substantielle les impots pour les ménages, c'est plutot le contraire, il y aura plutot un shift de l'impot sur le travail à l'impot sur le capital (ce que préconise l'OCDE à pas mal de pays d'ailleurs).

&gt; le seul moyen de s'en sortir s'est de perdre en pouvoir d'achat et de faire un choix entre produits cher et français ou produits bon marchés mais délocalisations 

oui c'est l'argumentaire des elites de l'ordre établi, ne touchons à rien sinon c'est l'apocalypse pour tous, évidemment cela ne repose sur aucune étude sérieuse.

LOL.

*Mon ennemi c'est la finance.*

Il a abandonné sa reforme bancaire et n'a pas remis en cause le pacte budgétaire. A partir de la, il a les pieds et mains liés. Les ""reformes"" suivantes ne sont qu'anodines et l'état de santé économique actuel de la France le prouve bien.


&gt;Mais sil ils ne surveillaient pas, on le leur reprocherait, non ? Je veux bien qu'ils ne surveillent pas, pas de problèmes, mais alors après il faut pas se plaindre si un attentat passe à travers les mailles du filet. 

Personne n'a dit qu'ils ne devaient pas surveiller mais cela doit se faire dans les règles d'un état de droit où la justice est responsable des décisions de surveillance, censure, filature, etc.. Pourtant ce qui est fait pour le moment, c'est la substitution du pouvoir judiciaire par l'établissement d'une administration au service de l’exécutif.

Among better educated Poles there's also long tradition of dividing your attitude towards regular Russians, and Russian government (see Adam Mickiewicz ""to friends Muscovites"", Jacek Kaczmarski ""I'm Russophile-anticommunist""). Many Polish politicians and literates quote these, and have similar attitude. I've recently tried to go for a Russian music evening in Buffo club in Warsaw - you have to register before, because there's huge demand for tickets.

So yeah, it's complicated, but very few Poles support Putin, and nobody would like to be annexed, or to return to soviet era sattelite relationship.

In the brilliant spectrum encompassed by Catalan gastronomy, sweets/desserts are, um, not a strong point. There's plenty of stuff that you'll find all around the world but when it comes to local traditional sweets, yeah. Not so much. (There are some really good pastries but that's not what you're asking for). 

As an alternative I'd suggest your folks visit one of our artisan candymakers. While not necessarily traditional they are handmade, yummy, and they make them right in the shop where you can watch. I think it would be an enjoyable experience for your parents and something really unique for you.

**Çukor** is a bit out of the center in C/Verdi but they do more than just hard candy - chocolates, marshmallows, etc.

**Pro:**

* Ottenere un mutuo è di una facilità imbarazzante.

* I rapporti con il vicinato: variabili a seconda del contesto, ma sempre volti alla cordialità ed al rispetto reciproco (chiaro, con le debite eccezioni). È d'uso, dove le case sono di proprietà, invitarsi reciprocamente a bere/mangiare qualcosa per conoscersi. Tutto senza diventare invadenti.

* È tutto molto più pulito e ben tenuto, comprese le case private.

* Le piste ciclabili.

* I trasporti pubblici: treni notturni, fermate degli autobus praticamente ovunque.

* La birra: è pieno di birrifici e pub con una selezione imbarazzante. Nei beer shop i prezzi sono bassissimi, anche per le birre d'importazione.

* D'estate il sole tramonta alle 23.

* Internet: ho Ziggo, l'anno scorso mi hanno fatto l'upgrade gratuito da 150/15Mbps a 180/80Mbps. Downtime inesistenti.

* Il cibo: si trova di tutto e di più.

**Contro:** (cioè quello che è meglio in Italia)

* L'assicurazione sanitaria e le tasse in genere. Per quanto il ritorno sia visibile, l'impatto dei primi tempi è un po' duro.

* Il clima di maggio e giugno: piove. Sole? Cos'è?

* Le verdure: trovarle buone è un dramma, quelle del supermercato sono immangiabili (difatti è pieno di verdurieri turchi, che le hanno buone). Io sto attrezzando il giardino, ho già una fava di 40cm!

Edit: ho dimenticato tre pro.

1.  L'educazione. Gira questo mito sulla leggendaria buona educazione dei giapponesi. Stronzate. I giapponesi soprattutto nelle metropoli possono essere delle bestie. Fatevi un giro in una stazione affollata e aspettatevi spallate, piedi pestati, gente che vi supera in fila o che si blocca sulle strade a chiacchierare facendovi perdere il treno. Senza un minimo tentativo di chiedere scusa.

2. Le case. A meno che non si tratti di appartamenti molto moderni dimenticatevi l'isolamento. D'inverno fa più freddo dentro che fuori. L'olio d'oliva trasformato in un blocco di ghiaccio mi rimarrà impresso per sempre. Inoltre, l'urbanistica. Non ha senso. Mucchi di palazzi, villette e appartamenti con stili completamente diversi l'uno dall'altro. Poi mi fa ridere chi parla di ""antico e moderno"" a Tokyo. E' al 99% orrido cemento e plastica.

3. La medicina. Non sono molto esperto ma sembrano parecchio arretrati qui. Inoltre i medici ti trattano con aria di sufficenza, dando per scontato che non capisci un cazzo (e parlando con i giapponesi in effetti non sanno neanche cosa sia un raffreddore). Pastiglie ovunque e strane medicine cinesi la fanno da padrone. 

4.   L'università. Una vacanza di quattro anni prima di entrare nel tremendo sistema lavorativo giapponese. Chi si aspetta di imparare qualcosa sbaglia.
