No. IMF funds come from across the world, and the leak from all the way back in 2010 showed that the non-europeans were particularly unhappy that the fund was being hijacked to support the euro when it is supposed to bail out countries only. Think Japan, Brazil, India, China - all very unhappy.

Traditionally the head of the IMF is a European, and Lagarde's term ends in 2016, and she wants to be reappointed. There is strong feeling that she shouldn't be. She distorted the economics to help the eurozone without helping Greece, and put the funds of IMF members at risk. In other words grossly incompetent.

A bunch of things. For example, they've been meeting their NATO obligations every year. If they were like Germany they would have just reneged on their NATO obligations, but that's really minor in the big scheme of things.

The real issue is because of law enforcement letting criminals get away with billions, upon billions. The failure to recover the money spent on [corrupt deals](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/world/europe/so-many-bribes-a-greek-official-cant-recall-all.html?_r=1) has been a major blow; a country that let's companies bribing politicians exist and doesn't make them repay, with penalties, can't claim to really support rule of law. In the cases of companies that are clearly controlled by one person or legal entity, such as [Deutsche Bahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bahn) Greece should investigate the entity as well; if it turns out that they knew of this corruption and did nothing, they should either be charged if a person or placed under direct Greek control if a legal entity. 

Rampant [tax evasion](http://www.thelocal.ch/20150705/athens-eyeing-deal-to-tax-assets-hidden-in-swiss-banks) is a serious problem as well; those banks need a police raid and the hidden assets should be seized and turned over to the Greece government, and the owners made to pay even more in penalties. So on and so forth. 

Look if these simple steps were taken earlier Greece wouldn't be in this mess. This is basically entirely Greece's fault for not making Germany, France, Switzerland and turn over criminals to the Greece justice system. Which Greece has the power to do because of European arrest warrants and I'm absolutely sure that those countries would honor a large number of warrants for their most powerful and influential members of society, and allow Greece to nationalize many of their largest companies. 

On a less pedantic note: Greece hasn't done great in managing its affairs. Obviously it was their corrupt politicians that accepted the deals and their law enforcement who didn't lock people up. And their messy welfare system and their bad tax system. But there is blame enough for all. I've seen nothing to indicate France or Germany are looking into the corruption or forcing repayment of the corrupt deals. And Greece really should try and force the issue with European Arrest Warrants since that IS a thing the Euro has systems in place for.

It's easy to fall in the futurist trap of thinking that just because money is inapplicable in space that these costs are irrelevant, but it's just not the case. These costs represent the difficulty of having a set of human beings perform the needed labor to extract, refine, and shape the materials.

To build a spacecraft of any sort, you need a wide variety of precision manufacturing capabilities. Each of the pieces of equipment needed (metal rollers, wire drawers, smelters) has a mass and power cost associated with it. All of that has to be shipped from Earth.

Making an actual spaceship from lunar regolith is, frankly, silly. The materials just aren't there, atomically speaking. You will never make a gasket when it is impossible to make polymers. Similarly, computers and electronics are impossible.

What about the moon as a refueling station? Well, it's 4.1 km/s delta-V from LEO to lunar orbit. That's the same cost as a trip to Mars, so why not dispense with all of this machinery, the power supply, the tanker that performs the refueling, and the life support and other infrastructure of probably having a permanent manned base on the moon, and just ship up fuel from Earth?

That *would* have resulted in a YES, or at least been much more likely than the ballot as presented was.

The other possibility that seems plausible to me is that Varoufakis is not telling the truth here.  Greece's government really wanted a NO vote (which makes sense to me, based on how the thing was presented to the Greek public) and expected that the troika would back down when faced with a Grexit.

OK most of the hospitals in Barcelona are private or concertado. 
Hospital del mar and hospital sant pau will charge more than hospital  clinic min 260, but the will rise. You could try Vall  d Hebron which is public but as an American they will probably still charge, although  much less that HDM HSP and clinic.

The consultation  in Vall Hebron is the region of 160€. It it's removed then and there that would be the full price. If you needed the operating theatre I don't know but it costs around 8-10000€ give or take a couple grand to book the O.R in hospital sant pau..I guess the same for HDM as they use the same pricing structure.

The other option is to call a private clinic, maybe fax them your medical report from before and ask if you can book an appointment  to get it removed. You might be able to organise  it to happen in one session but I doubt it will come under 400€. I hope that helps.

Great analysis! You are totally correct.

The Greeks, even now, believe that the present circumstances are just temporary and 'normal life' will return. When will the government face up to the citizens and tell them that the old life of guaranteed state employment, cradle to grave welfare, and steadily increasing pensions and early retirement are gone, never to return.

The extreme left is dead. It is mostly upper middle class people and public sector employes with no fear of unemployment who love imigration and promote diversity at all cost. They love hybrid cars, want to kill nuclear and let more muslims come. Needless to say it is hard to find a factory worker among them these days ...

The left doesn't exist anymore. The socialist party is neoliberalism with gay rights. Two current ministers could make good center right candidates (interior and economy ministers). Valls is making a reputation as a crime crusher (while the left is traditionaly laxist), he made his brand by saying ""we should not let illegal imigrants and muslims do all the shit they want"". Macron is a pure elite technocrat banker, very young and cool, he made not a single political mistake, he just does finance stuff and remains out of the stupid fights. He is playing the card the competent technocrat ""you don't like bankers, but I am the only one who knows what to do"".

The right is neoliberalism with a little less gay rights. They are still killing each other. No new head, just Sarkozy friends (well, as friendly as politicians can be to each other) fighting each other and Sarkozy coming back ""This is the second coming of your lord and savior"". A very wise old guard politician, Juppé, is starting to say ""you stupid, if you can't find an agreement I will come back to national politics"".

The extreme right, FN, is getting lots of popular support. It was the first party at the EU elections! But lots of people would vote against by principle so they most likely cannot win a presidential election. ""We leave the euro, we tell Bruxels to shut up, we take back the control of banks and we restaure our most glorious nation with powerful politicians.

&gt; but the individual states are clearly less powerful than the national government

Sort of.  They rarely run directly into each other, because each have their own defined sphere of influence.

Generally-speaking, the federal sphere has informally steadily expanded, but I wouldn't say that one is directly ""more powerful"", particularly in 1789.

&gt; State laws must still be consistent with the national Constitution

This was not considered to be the norm in 1789: see [incorporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights).  It wasn't until the 1900s that a combination of judicial and legislative changes made this to be the case.

Also, the US Constitution is both hard to amend and very limited in size and scope, so this requirement is weaker than it would be if, say, the proposed European Union constitution had gone through with the same requirement.

&gt;  States cannot easily leave the union

Weeeellll....that wasn't actually expressly stated anywhere and was in fact the major point of contention in the 1860s American Civil War.

&gt; However, the national government heavily subsidizes state welfare and uses heavy national taxes and welfare and national projects to move money from rich states to poorer states maintaining a roughly equivalent standard of living between states.

Again, this really came much later.  There wasn't really any sort of welfare state in the US in 1789 -- that wasn't [until the 1900s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States).  That describes the modern state of affairs, but not really the initial incarnation of the constitution.

Also, there are still substantial differences in standard-of-living,
and a number of important welfare programs are state.  Although,
sometimes via under-the-table routes, there has been a trend of moving
state welfare to federal welfare.  For example, [Clinton moved people off of unemployment (state) whereupon they were often (fraudulently) picked up by disability (federal) programs](http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/).  While this is a kind of sketchy way to go about doing this, it effectively shifted burden off poor states.

At that point it has not been formed and approved by all the democratic leaders required for legislation to pass, so no.

If you refer to the legislation being formed by Commission and approved by Council of Ministers, so what? It cannot become legislation *unless the parliament approves it*. If the parliament rejects the legislation, it cannot become a law. If the parliament is unhappy with the formed law, the parliament can vote changes into the law and then approve it and then see if the Council of Ministers approve the changes. You fail to understand that the Parliament is not extra of the ""democratic leaders"" who form and approve the legislation. The Parliament *is a part* of those ""democratic leaders"" forming and approving the laws.

&gt;Thereby, there exists a full and functioning process without the parliament. Yes?

No, because according to the Lisbon Treaty the functioning legislative process of the EU for the most part is heavily dependent on the parliament.

What you say could be said about the Council of Ministers. Remove the Council of Ministers and just let the Commission do the proposals and the democratic representatives of the Parliament to approve the laws. Thereby, there exist a full and functioning process without the Council of Ministers. Yes?

The point of bicameral legislation is to have the legislation pass through two institutions to have alternative views on the legislation. The EU legislative system is bicameral, just like the US legislative system. 

Sure, unicameral legislative branches are possible (like Finland and Sweden have), but within the EU, if one wants to make the legislation unicameral, one might as well remove the Council of Ministers and let the Parliament alone pass the laws.

You can apply Earth economies of scale for cars, not for spaceships. It will still cost thousands of dollars to ship every kilogram of spaceship to LEO, and barring a space elevator there is nothing we can do to significantly reduce that. As soon as you start scaling, the almost-free cost of putting stuff in orbit from the lunar surface catches on quick, potentially offsetting the increased costs of life support.

&gt; And that's with the work being done by humans

Which is the least efficient and most error prone way to do work. Obviously a lunar base has to be highly automated and robiticized. Every field that is simple enough for automation proves that robots are better, safer and more efficient than humans.

&gt; using power generated from fossil fuels

Solar power on the moon can be practically free (once installed) and 100% previsible (no weather).

&gt; All of that has to be shipped from Earth.

Nope, all of that can be in 90% made on site (after bootstrapping), especially the heaviest (metal) parts. You ship resins, filters, life support, electronics from earth.

&gt; Making an actual spaceship from lunar regolith is, frankly, silly

I know. That's why I didn't suggest it.

&gt; Similarly, computers and electronics are impossible.

Great strawman argument. Notice how I specifically only said ""metal structures"" and ""rocket fuel"". Incidentally, the heaviest parts of any vehicle. No computers, polymers, cushions or philly cheese steaks.

&gt; What about the moon as a refueling station? Well, it's 4.1 km/s delta-V from LEO to lunar orbit

So you suggest to make a refueling station on the moon with fuel shipped from Earth? I'm confused...

&gt; Using it for manufacture of spacecraft or for fuel just can't get traction with respectable people.

I do think that it will be *extremely* difficult to enforce, because it is terrifically-easy to store data in many places (backups, past data-mining, sold information, duplication of databases, logs, caches, decentralized storage/storage services, backups that they have, etc).

Sometime, look at a typical modern website: you've got everything from Google Analytics to twenty other services all trying to figure out what exactly you're up to and profile you, and the site you're using isn't particularly concerned about what it's leaking information-wise.  You've got persistent cookies; attempts to stop those were circumvented with Flash shared objects.  Solve that, and you can go do other unpleasant things (e.g. visit unique pages, use CSS to cause the style of links to be measurably different, query the appearance via Javascript, and thus make use of browser history to store unique identifiers), and on and on, and on.  [Browsers give up a lot of unique information on every request anyway](https://panopticlick.eff.org/).

I run an *extremely* paranoid setup: I almost always avoid using a cell phone, I purchase that cell phone with cash and without any connection to my address, don't regularly carry it and when I do carry it mostly have it off.  I don't use Google, I block advertisements, wipe Flash shared objects, disable scripts, don't provide accurate personal information, use services that generate false-but-verifiable contact, credit card, and so forth information...the point is, it's all way more than Joe Smith is able or willing to do.  Furthermore, it's only the fact that Joe Smith *isn't* doing this that makes it viable, since if he was, you'd have people out trying to figure out how to data-mine more information.

And even with *that* kind of setup, there are still numerous attacks that could be performed to identify and track me.  I don't even specialize in that kind of tracking, and I can rattle off far too many ways in which companies could reasonably track me and profile me.

Now, if Europe can propose a *working* solution, I'd be delighted.  The EFF has done a hell of a lot of work on trying to create limited technical solutions where possible.  The Snowden affair has driven at least a bit of market interest in privacy.  But we're a terribly long ways from getting Auntie May to not having a bit fat profile owned by a number of companies associated with her profile.  And while legislation *sounds* nice, it's not an all-seeing, all-powerful oracle.  You go out and guarantee this right, now you get a lot of companies moving to, say, Indonesia or Russia.  How well can you verify compliance and enforce that compliance now?

What if a company just outsources all of its dubious activities, as a lot of companies did with spam?  If ""userinsight.com"", which has some Javascript on your page, actually complying?  Is there liability for you if the don't?  If not, it's easy for there to be *one* fly-by-night country in Indonesia, and if so, any company that uses some external service runs liability risk.

But much as I'd love a solution, I don't see adding regulatory requirements as being an effective way to go about doing this: it adds red tape to starting up a dot-com, and it's just got too many holes.

You want to improve privacy, my best suggestion would be authorizing strong end-to-end encryption for cell phones (at the cost of your own governments not being able to look inside) and email and promoting use there.  That's viable and just needs a certain established base and more ease-of-use.

But I don't believe that current privacy legislation is likely to provide an effective solution, and it does impose compliance costs.  I don't think that we yet have a technical solution, which I think would be the way to go.",null,0,null,1436931661,null,0,1436932620,0,ct3s66q,null,t3_3dahe4,null,t1_ct3s66q,null,t1_ct3jqcy,null,null,null,1437862869,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

You do indeed use the dative in those three sentences. And not for any reason that has to do with direct/indirect objects, but simply because the preposition ""mit"" always takes the dative. My profs used to always say ""prepositions are such divas - they call the shots."" So no matter what else is going on in a sentence, if there's a preposition, THAT'S what determines the case you use after it. So it's really quite simple, it's just always mit + dative.

In the case that you qualify, the max payment for a student living at home is about €195 per fortnight. If you have a job, then every week you have to report your income to the government using their website, and they deduct an amount from the payments they give you depending on how much you earn, but it isn't a whole lot. If you live away from home, then it's a max of €290 fortnightly. Twice a year there's a lump sum payment of €700 to help with university costs like textbooks.

There's also other payments for rent assistance, if you live away from home, which are paid in addition to Youth Allowance:

In these cases your family members are the dative objects [edit: in my own understanding of what an object is anyway] in these sentences and need to be put into the dative case (including the articles), because the preposition *mit* is always followed by the dative. The *Fußball* is the accusative object in a sentence with two objects. Other prepositions warrant other cases like the genitive or accusative, some like *in* or *auf* are followed by the accusative *or* dative, depending on the context. Few others can be followed by the dative *or* genitive, unrelated to the context (*laut*, *dank*, *trotz*), so it's your choice. In everyday language, prepositions that must actually be followed by the genitive case like *während* or *wegen* are often followed by the dative case, which is poor form and should at least be avoided when writing something down.

Tu peux m'accuser de répéter la bouche en coeur un roman national, mais tes propos fleurent franchement bon le complotisme à deux balles. Les juifs favorisés pour diviser le pays ? Arrête ton délire. C'était juste une erreur politique. Auparavant les juifs et musulmans d'Algérie pouvaient être français très simplement (merci Napoléon III), mais l'opposition et l'Eglise catholique ont tout fait pour faire en sorte que les Algériens ne puissent pas devenir français. Crémieux (lui même juif) a arraché le fait qu'au moins les 35 000 juifs puissent rester français : tu parles d'une division du pays (on parle là d'une population extrêmement minoritaire). C'était un lot de consolation, en partie justifié par le fait que c'était une minorité, comme d'habitude pas mal opprimée. Au final dans les faits je suis d'accord sur le fait que c'était une erreur morale et politique et que ça a conduit à diviser encore plus musulmans et juifs, mais je ne vois pas où est le complot ""Diviser pour mieux régner"", il n'y avait pas grand chose à y gagner.

&gt;La seule raison qui fait que les Français et les Indiens s'entendaient bien, c'est que les Français étaient 50 000 pour la totalité de l'Amérique du Nord. 

Ben oui, et ? Le fait de n'envoyer que 50 000 hommes (et je dis bien hommes) fait bien partie d'un mode de colonisation différent que celui d'envoyer des millions de familles entières ayant pour vocation de s'installer et virer les locaux. On est dans quelque chose de complètement différent, et c'est complètement lié aux visions qu'avais les deux sociétés de l'époque sur le statut des indiens (hors de question de ne serait ce que se mélanger à ces être sans âmes pour les britanniques tandis qu'on allait jusqu'à célébrer des mariages franco-indiens). Oui le nombre compte énormément, mais c'est toute la différence entre une colonisation de peuplement et d'occupation et une colonisation d'influence. Ca a toujours été comme ça qu'à fonctionné la France, ce n'est pas pour rien qu'il n'y a pas des millions de blancs au Mali, au Vietnam ou à Madagascar (mais paradoxalement, une grande influence de la France en Françafrique dont on profite encore énormément), là où les anciennes colonies britanniques sont souvent aujourd'hui encore remplies de descendants de colons européens (Afrique du Sud, Australie, Nouvelle-Zélande). C'était exactement la même chose en Amérique, on commerçait avec les tribus indiennes (pour la fourrure) avec un nombre minimal de soldats pour protéger les intérêts de la France (donc en partie protéger les tribus locales) et avoir des intermédiaires intégrés aux tribus. Côté britannique, c'était colonie de peuplement, on débarque en famille, on construit des villes et on dégage les natifs. C'est juste deux visions complètement différentes bien représentatives des différences entre les deux nations. 

&gt;En plus c'est drole, tu parles que des Anglais. T'es conscient des nations colonisatrices y'en as plus que deux non ? Les Hollandais cherchaient pas à imposer leur coutumes, et ils ont génocidé personne non plus, pourquoi ça serait pas eux les meilleurs ?

Vrai, mais je connais mal, excuse moi de n'être au fait que pour les plus importants (France, UK et Espagne). Bon c'est dommage mais je ne retrouve plus cette caricature d'époque qui montrait les différences entre les types de colonisations entre peuples européens (caricature allemande, au cas où tu penserai que c'est partial). On y voyait des allemands mettre en rang des girafes, des belges en train de faire rôtir des natifs et des français en train de s'acoquiner avec des femmes (je me souviens plus les autres, mais c'était pas glorieux, paradoxalement aujourd'hui, les français avait l'air de loin d'être les plus sympas, mais à l'époque c'était sensé montrer qu'on est des gros dégueulasse, en gros).

Let's assume that Russia truly wants to retake the Baltics.  To do that and come out on top, they need to assume one of the following things to be true:

* Other NATO members will simply ignore this.  This seems like an exceedingly-unlikely scenario, though at least it would be an acceptable outcome for Russia.

* Other NATO members will engage in conventional war with Russia, but lose.  This seems absurd.  Russia's conventional capabilities are nowhere near those of the sum of NATO's.

* Other NATO members will be warded off via credible threat of nuclear use (perhaps involving limited nuclear use).  This is an extremely large gamble.  Even if it doesn't result in assassinations, political subversion, *severe* economic isolation, or many, many other unpleasant things, it is ensuring that a lot of the rest of the economic and military power in the world is now actively-seeking to cause your collapse.  It seems inconceivable that possession of the Baltic states would make up for the costs that would certainly be attached.

* Russia can successfully prosecute an offensive nuclear war and win.  First, this is an extremely-difficult prospect: it would involve identifying and hitting all of the US nuclear capacity, including submarines, simultaneously, as well as a bunch of Europe.  Even if carried off successfully, this would devastate the global economy and turn Russia into a likely source of threat for the result of the world.  It seems unlikely that Russia would ""win"" even in the traditional sense of the word, and even if it did, it seems unlikely that Russia would truly be better-off.

Every outcome seems to me to be extremely risky or to have costs that simply make Russia lose out on the net.

Now, okay, perhaps there are other explanations: a madman becomes leader of Russia and decides to attack, whatever the costs, or something like that, but that's *always* a risk, and doesn't seem to have much to do with the Baltics in particular.

I find Russia's ""it's just a populist politician being an idiot"" explanation to be quite a bit more-compelling than one of the above explanations.  I realize that the costs are high and that it's easier for me to brush it off than for someone living in the Baltics, but I cannot see a way in which Russia could rationally think attacking the Baltics would be in its interest.",null,0,null,1436933621,null,0,1436939129,0,ct3t5z7,null,t3_3dc0d0,null,t1_ct3t5z7,null,t3_3dc0d0,null,null,null,1437863611,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

The best tip I can give: don't back down.  If you finish one program/book, move onto another.  If what once program/book doesn't get you excited to learn or isn't working for you, get another.  There is a whole slew of materials for German, don't just stick to one source.

Other tips:  As a beginner, use a program that has audio.  Also, you'll come upon points where you may get discouraged and think ""I'll never be able to internalize this"" or ""I don't get why it works this way"".  It will become clear and automatic with practice, no matter how difficult you think it is, so don't get discouraged; keep on moving.

Some programs that I think would really benefit a beginner (some already mentioned):
Duolingo - Free, gives you a basic grasp and introduction to the language

DeutscheWelle (dw.de) - All free and provides great material at all levels (this is where you'll find Warum Nicht, as well as other courses)

Hugo German in 3 Months - It's a book but it's fairly cheap on Amazon.  Great for grammar and structured learning

Assimil - I think one of, if not the best programs.  You have to buy it (Amazon), but this will no doubt give you a great lead from beginner to intermediate.  If you decide to use this, start it maybe after you've been studying for a month or so, so you don't get too overwhelmed.

TeachYourself - I've personally never went too deep with these but a lot of people swear by them.  It's worth checking out

Pimsleur - Another great program.  It only emphasizes speaking, but it does an excellent job at it.  Your local library might have this.

Michel Thomas - Another great program that emphasizes speaking, but there's an online pdf of the lessons so you can see how it's written.  Your library might have this too.

Readers - These are basically short story books designed for learners.  Search Amazon for ""German Reader"" and you'll find a bunch.  I think the ones by Andre Klein are excellent for beginners and a lot of them have audio components as well.

Quizlet - It won't teach you German by itself but its basically an online flashcard manager (it has an app also for phones/tablets).  I've found this to be very helpful for all of my vocab words.

Youtube - You can use this for supplementary material for specific topics.  Does your book not explain the accusative or dative case well?  Having trouble with separable verbs?  Pronunciation?  There are tons of videos of people explaining all these things.

Yabla - Kind of like a Youtube for language learners.  It has a ton of videos (instructional and random German videos, music too) that provide subtitles, flash card systems, etc.  You have to pay for it but this is a great investment and a great way of getting accustomed to the natural flow of the language.

FluentU - Works just like Yabla, just a different company

I'll post more if I think of anything else.  Just take it slow, have fun, pick up the pace as your interest accelerates.  German is a very fun an rewarding language to learn.  Viel Spaß!

Having no debt means that you are using your cash reserves to fund investments and capital maintenance, which is very risky when you could instead issue bonds with a very low interest rate to fund them instead. 

The only reason that we are not all serfs slaving away to a tiny number of feudal lords is because of bank loans and finance which empowered people to go into debt in order to build their own businesses and empires. 

Debt isn't bad. Debt is essential. 

What is bad is simply piling on more loans to a country so that they can pay back existing loans. It's like opening a credit card to pay off your credit card bills. What you really need to do is restructure and make the payments affordable, so that the country can start investing in their economy again.

I'm not following.

I'm saying that Russian median household income is $11,724.  The unattainable goal is $17,700.  That means that only 20% of Russians believe that it is possible to have a net worth of a year-and-a-half of income over their lifetimes.

In 2013, median household income for the US was $52,250.  Do you think that only 20% of people in the US could imagine a non-criminal having a net worth of about $80k?  The [median new home sales price in the US](https://www.census.gov/const/uspriceann.pdf) as of 2010 was $222k.  That would mean believing that any person who paid off a *third* of his house's value, much less someone who fully-owned his house, was a criminal.  Doesn't that sound implausible to you?

Here, another [Russia-specific tidbit](http://opec.ru/en/1758772.html):

&gt; Property ownership makes most Russians – even those without bank accounts – actual millionaires. The median value of a Russian family's primary residence stands at 1.6 million rubles, which is 4.7 times lower than the European median (180,300 euro, or 7,752,900 rubles) and 3.3 times less than the U.S. median (170,000 dollars, or 5,440,000 rubles), except for residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg, where the average family residence costs 7.4 million rubles.
&gt;
&gt; In Russia, 32.3% of the households own a second property in addition to their residence – compared to 23.1% of the European households. However, additional property rarely brings extra income, since only 5% of the families lease their property out, while most use it as a summer house (dacha).

How is it possible to reconcile those views on wealth (1M rubles seems unattainable to non-criminals) with reality (the median Russian family has 1.6M rubles in one piece of real estate alone)?

EDIT: Well, median Russian *house-owning* family, to be precise.

EDIT2: I also should have used median US house price rather than median *new* house price above, but I think that it still pretty much captures the point; existing homes were ~$190k rather than $222k.",null,0,null,1436937217,null,0,1436990801,0,ct3urnl,null,t3_3dbmmc,null,t1_ct3urnl,null,t1_ct3u58w,null,null,null,1437864656,null,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9,null

This is not true. The Juncker proposal had 400 million spending cuts while the current deal has 100 million and 200 million for 2015 and 2016 respectively. This is because Syriza's coalition partner is a ultranationalist party and their leader is the Minister of Defense. 

He even asked for guarantees that these spending cuts would not be in the form of reduction on military personel.

As for the IMF, which is probably the cause of this misconception, their rule book apparently tells them that they cannot ask for military spending cuts.

---

Regarding this latest information; IMF speaks from the safety of its rules that dissalows issuing such a grace period or a debt haircut for their own loans. 

There are similar rules for the ECB from my understanding. Additionally, there is no need for this extension at this point (since the country-loans that would be extended will not start getting repayed for quite a few years), what is important at this point is for Greece to get a deal. 

Considering 18 parliaments need to vote in favor of this new memorandum, it is much easier for it to pass without a grace period in it.

The fucker puts it in his garage and waits. The bike was officially registered as stolen the same night (cops were called because 10 or more bikes were stolen at the same time from the front yard of the party), so all he had to do was to stroll into the station on monday morning, take a look in the registry of stolen bikes and give me a fucking call!

Two month pass, I'm saving hard to buy a new one. My mum calls me from her work and says she found my bike. I am beyond excited.
She worked at a dentist that time and somehow she and a patient came to talk about bicycles. The cop tells how he found a bike and coudn't find the owner (ever heard of Fundbüro?!) and my mother directly recognizes it from the description (it was a pretty unique bicycle).
Picked it up the same day, stood in his garage, still locked. Opened the lock and drove away. His son was crying because he was probably promised that he could keep it. Lucky for him (and my criminal record) that he didn't, I probably would have tackled him right off if I would've seen him or any other person riding my bike.

mal ehrlich: auf tweets in massen zu verweisen. ist ... so was von 2013, aber so was von ... ""cool"" wie ein tamagochi, als die in massen verhungerten.

demokratie heisst auch, daß die mehrheit bestimmt, was passiert, und bei 18:1 kann ich die schnappatmer und ihr gejammer, die demokratie oder europa seien am ende, nicht so ganz nachvollziehen. im fußball nennt man so was wohl ""eine schwalbe"", oder?

man fragt sich, ob die, die nicht verstehen, daß politik das organisieren von mehrheiten ist, in dem moment, als das im sozialkundeunterricht erklärt wurde, gerade ihr tamagochi gefüttert haben ;-)

This agreement was reached even thought the debt was sustainable until end of summer 2014 (Source: All IMF reports including the one leaked 2 weeks ago).

---

Sadly, this never came to fruition because Syriza came to power before the 2nd memorandum agreement was finilized; because the previous government lost momentum after getting butchered during the European elections on June 2014; and, to an extent, because Syriza called the people not to pay the taxes because - as they said at the time - they would rip apart the memorandum with a single law. 

However, this time they will be forced to eventually offer a debt restructuring because the debt is no longer sustainable.

Meiner Meinung nach ist das ganze Resultat der fixen Idee, völlig unterschiedliche Länder könnten bei Beibehalt der vollen Souveränität die gleiche Währung beibehalten. Langfristig wird es nicht ohne fiskalische Transfers gehen, und die bedeuten nunmal einen Eingriff in die Budgethoheit des Geberlandes. Im Ausgleich werden eben entweder große Bereiche auf eine föderale Ebene verlagert (wo dann egal ist wessen Geld wo verwendet wird) oder die Nehmerländer müssen sich teilweise sagen lassen wie sie vorgehen. In der Regel nimmt man die erste Variante.

So, Varoufakis is either a liar or an idiot. I doubt it is the second one because, simply put, everyone knew that the banks would not open within 24 hours. 

With that said, I see no reason believe that the following is not true:

&gt; Varoufakis says that Schauble told him he wants a Grexit to ""discipline other member states""

It was common sense. If Varoufakis' gambit wins, the Eurozone would have to deal with another ""rebellion"" from Spain and Podemos. 

With that said, the latest agreement is extremely harsh because there is a need for a very, very large loan (smaller than prior the referendum and the banks closing) and because the Greek government has not proven to be trustworthy both towards the creditors and the Greek people. As for the prior-actions, they are necessary to detect if Tsipras' government can actually pass and implement such laws.

---

As a Greek, I am not happy with what is happening but I can understand the stance of the creditors and Schauble himself. For all intents and purposes, Varoufakis played right into Schauble's hand; diplomacy is the way to defeat a much stronger opponent (example: according to sources on Monday, our President told Hollande that since Merkel won't do it, it is his chance to prove his worth and keep Europe united [this was reported in the Greek media but, other than the actual phone call, the content of the conversation is not confirmed by official channels]) and not an aggressive stance.

&gt; Fristen verstreichen lassen 

es gab so einen punkt, an dem ich zu argwöhnen begann, daß das wohl von anfang an so kalkuliert war, also das scheitern von seiten syrizas ""eingepreist"" und letztlich auch beabsichtigt - und die anderen 18 bewusst auf die schippe genommen wurden. das referendum war dann nur noch die kirsche auf der torte.

auf der ""menschlichen ebene"" könnte ich ja noch bis zu einem gewissen grad damit leben, daß junge ungestüme und von der wahl noch leicht von der eigenen bedeutung besoffene männer dem verknöcherten ""altherrenklub"" mal zeigen wollen, wie der hase ab jetzt so läuft. 

ich könnte auch verständnis für die ganzen bewussten demütigungen und das vorführen von eu-personal haben, aber ich denke mal, da waren sie wohl ein bißchen zu punky für die alten jazzer.

auf der ""strategischen ebene"" kann man sich natürlich fragen, ob das, was du da ""fristen verstreichen lassen"" nennst, nicht ein ganz bewusstes spekulieren auf die berechenbaren mechanismen der gegenüber war. das haben die griechischen vertreter wohl eins zwei mal zu viel gemacht, zu wenig auf den menschlichen faktor geachtet und so das spiel überreizt.

auf der ""systemebene"": das system funktioniert ja nur, wenn sich alle darauf verlassen können, daß sich alle an die demokratisch in langen und zähen verhandlungen (früher noch mit einstimmigkeit) vereinbarten regeln halten. 

ich kenne im grunde kein system, in dem soviel demokratie und solidarität und einigungswillen drinsteckt wie in der EU. die hat gerade einen schlechten ruf, weil zu viele leute, die sich auf irgendwelche teilaspekte kapriziert haben, von denen sie glauben, eine ahnung zu haben, wild durcheinander quasseln und jeder den anderen mit seiner eigenen tatarenmeldung übertrumpfen muss. 

im moment sieht sich das system gezwungen, seinen worten auch taten folgen zu lassen und nüchtern betrachtet, macht es das zu einem zeitpunkt und in einer relation, die noch ""handhabbar"" sind ... 

ich stelle mir vor, wie sich das darstellen würde, wenn der prozess, der gerade stattfindet. erst vier fünf jahren akut wäre und der zustand der welt noch weiter ""erodiert""

It was clear from the beginning that there were going to be massive problems due to income disparity and the difference in cost for daily expenditures.  I'm only surprised that it has take this long for serious problems to emerge.

The difference in cost for things like a beer, toothpaste, a newspaper, a meal, etc were too great for a single currency to work very well.  For people living in places like Spain and Italy they say the cost of simple items they use/consume daily shot up by between 2-5 times while their incomes did not change by much.  This meant that a greater proportion of the average person's income went into daily purchases, pushing them personally closer to financial insolvency.

Of course, governments and businesses liked it as it made it easier to borrow money and to ship cheap labor around without having to having to go through the expensive and time consuming process of getting visas for imported workers.

The idea of a *politically* unified Europe is a good one, but the currency should have been left out of it.

This was something we all talked about a lot during the 90s when it became public knowledge that the European Union was going to happen.

According to Varoufakis, both him and Tsipras certainly *expected* YES to win. As I remember, he said that if the result was Yes, he would resign. That does not imply the converse, i.e. if the result was No, he *would not* resign.

Why he resigned in his own words:

&gt; I jumped more than I was pushed. On the night of the referendum, Phillip, I entered the Prime Ministerial office elated. I was traveling on a beautiful cloud, pushed by the beautiful winds of the public's enthusiasm for the victory of Greek democracy during that referendum. The moment I entered the Prime Ministerial office, I sensed immediately a certain sense of resignation and a negatively charged atmosphere. I was confronted with an air of defeat which was completely at odds with what was happening outside. At that point I had to put it to the Prime Minister: ""If you want to use the buzz of democracy outside the gates of this splendid building, you can count on me. But if on the other hand you feel you cannot manage, you cannot handle the big--this majestic NO to a rather irrational proposition from our European partners, then I'm going to simply steal into the night."" And I could see he didn't have an attitude, he didn't have what it took sentimentally--emotionally at the moment to carry that NO vote to Europe, to use it as a weapon. 
So, I--in the best possible spirit—the two of us get on remarkably well, and will continue to get on, I hope—I decided to give him the leeway that he needs in order to go back to Brussels and strike what he knows to be an impossible deal, a deal that is simply not viable.",null,0,null,1436945438,null,0,false,0,ct3xjk6,null,t3_3dag88,null,t1_ct3xjk6,null,t1_ct3wxmw,null,null,null,1437865942,null,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5,null

No, because if that was the reason, you wouldn't

- refuse debt restructuring/relief

&gt;Outright forgiving of debt would be out of the question IMO, because if Greece gets its debt forgiven, why can't we too get a debt relief

AFAIAC you can, for the interest incurred during the 2007-2010 period, and all Eurozone countries should. Because it was the lack of emergency liquidity facilities in the Eurozone that caused the spike in bond rates during that period. That will limit it to a very specific period in time, so no moral hazard.

Io sono ateo, però capisco che per molte persone il semplice fatto di ascoltare una bestemmia possa creare disagio. La bestemmia non offende l'interlocutore direttamente. Lo offende insultando qualcosa che è a lui molto caro ed, allo stesso tempo, offende tutte le persone che condividono tale sentimento e si trovano, anche per caso (e senza poterlo evitare), ad ascoltare la bestemmia.

That's actually the case: the banking crisis forced Greece and other EZ governments to bail out private banks that went bankrupt through *their*, not the governments reckless lending. Why blame the governments for it? 
Secondly, there were no emergency liquidity facilities in the eurozone, leading to spiking interest rates on bond and snowballing interest on government debt. That's a construction fault in the eurozone, not the fault of individual governments, who could have dealt with that individually if they still had their own central banks.

184 Fälle, das sind rund 15 Fälle im Monat, oder einer jeden zweiten Tag. 

34 Fälle von Gewaltkriminalität wegen der sexuellen Orientierung, das entspricht einem Fall alle 10-11 Tage. Bundesweit. 

Wir bewegen uns in Fallzahlen die vergleichbar sind mit den Fallzahlen für ""Besonders schwerer Fall des Diebstahls von Betäubungsmitteln aus Apotheken"" (186), oder dem ""Nachmachen, Verfälschen, Verschaffen, Feilhalten oder Überlassen falscher Zahlungskarten ohne Garantiefunktion"" (185 Fälle). Betrachtet man nur die Gewalttaten, dann entsprechen die Fallzahlen denen von ""Fälschung von Gesundheitszeugnissen""  (34 Fälle) und ""Sportdoping"" (35 Fälle). 

Bei rund 6,1 Millionen erfassten Gesamtstraftaten sind ""Hassstraftaten aufgrund sexueller Ausrichtung"" mit 184 bzw. 34 Fällen im Promicro-Bereich (0,00003% bzw. 0,0000056%). 

Ich denke, das sind Zahlen, die so niedrig sind, daß man Schwerpunkte vielleicht wirklich anders setzen könnte. Wir haben 2,4 Millionen Diebstahlsdelikte, 767000 Delikte gegen die persönliche Freiheit, 601000 Sachbeschädigungen (Bitte mal daran denken, wenn wieder mal ein ""Wir mauern die Türe der S-Bahn zu""-Video hier gepostet wird), rund 500000 Rauschgiftdelikte (Man könnte hier endlich mal Richtung Legalisierung gehen).

I've read from more than one source that the hyperinflation many attribute to reparations was artificially boosted on purpose by Germany to try to dodge the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. 

And you can't forget about the Great Depression and its effect on all of Europe and not just the United States. 

That's just my reading on the subject though. When it comes to history facts are not usually so cut and dry.

The rest of Germanpod101 is a regret for me. They have this guy, whose pronunciations are really not clear, as their main speaker for their audio files. I oftentimes have a hard time understanding what he says. He can't pronounce the sound ""ch"" in ""ich"" or the sound ""ig"" in ""richtig"" clearly. For example, when I listened to this sentence ""Ich weiß nicht, ob ich richtig bin"". One only hears a bunch of ""sh"" sound as the ""sh"" in English word ""fish"". There are many examples like this in his pronunciations. I commented about this issue. I didn't say anything rude to them What I said was that they should have used a different speaker for beginner's lessons. Well, alas, they didn't like what I said. What I got were unfriendly replies and later on my comments on the webpages were removed, without my consent. 

I was an idiot, who decided to buy their course. Fortunately, the online teacher I was assigned to is a very nice person and always corrects my writings promptly.

(There should be an article of his coming out in Die Zeit tomorrow that outlines this idea.) From Schäuble's statements over the years and his actions as of late, I think this is the most likely explanation. Schäuble doesn't care about short-term losses due to Greece doing bankrupt if it can secure a much bigger win for Germany.

Now this being said, there are some places where you can still drink outdoors at night, let's say the City Hall and police are botellón-friendly. Zones with no neighbors and such. 

If you are in a beach town, more likely some zones by the sea shore, off the promenade, with some street lamps but not 'in the middle of everything'. 

If you are in an inland city usually parks or Industrial Parks near party zones, but it works the same way, not in busy streets. 

Also it never (or almost never) happens in the middle of a street. You have to know beforehand where to go. Oh, and it is **only on Friday and Saturday nights.**

During my teens and a bit deep in my twenties I have done botellón all over Spain and never got caught. 

In Madrid the botellón zone is Parque Del Oeste, between Paseo de Ruperto Chapi street and Avenida Arco de la Victoria or Paseo de Moret. Metro: Moncloa, but it depends on where you want to go after. Check /r/Madrid wiki for party zones. Also maybe Ciudad Universitaria metro, but since it is summer University is closed. I have never done botellón in other place than that in Madrid!

&gt;Using money from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) is the most controversial option.

&gt;Sweden, Denmark, the Czech Republic and the UK voiced their opposition to the idea because the EFSM is guaranteed by all 28 EU member states, not only eurozone countries.

&gt;Connor Campbell of Spreadex said: 'Despite reports coming out of today’s ECOFIN meeting that George Osborne and [German finance minister] Wolfgang Schauble, as well as the finance ministers of Denmark and Sweden, were against using the EFSM to finance Greece’s impending ECB repayments, the latest rumours are that the European Commission is still going to go ahead with recommending that the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism be used.

2nd part of the question: it is not relevant how healthy you are as the public health insurance will take you no matter what. Actually, it is compulsory for you to get one in Germany. You will be taxed based on your salary and not on your health.
If you take a private health insurance (you can have one if you exceed 54.900,00€ in 2015), you can pay less now but you will be fucked if you get any major illnesses.

Cities have their theme but maybe not as extreme as we are a smaller country- our differences in culture a more nuanced.

However, any spread in Italian bond yields will force them to either increase deficit spending at a higher cost...or enforce greater austerity which would drive down consumption and impact growth. Given the stagnant growth projections as they currently are, limiting consumption would be counter-productive.

Not really... If you neglect the advantageous tax classes, those benefits are given to people who actually raise children, not those who are just married. So things like Kindergeld is paid to parents regardless wether they are single, married or partnered.

Adopting as a homosexual couple also kinda works. See, the couple themselves can't adopt a child together. But one of them can adopt one as a single parent, citing being in a stable relationship as a plus point. The second parent can then adopt the child of the first one.

So yeah, madness. This kind of circumventing tradition is done very often in Germany. You have one crowd that wants something changed, and one that is afraid of change, so we just reinvent the wheel and everybody is happy.

**Toledo School of Translators**

The Toledo School of Translators (Spanish: Escuela de Traductores de Toledo) is the group of scholars who worked together in the city of Toledo during the 12th and 13th centuries, to translate many of the philosophical and scientific works from classical Arabic, classical Greek, and ancient Hebrew.

**Legacy**

The translations of works on different sciences, such as astronomy, astrology, algebra, medicine, etc. acted as a magnet for numerous scholars from all over Europe who came to Toledo eager to learn first hand about the contents of all those books that had been out of reach to Europeans for many centuries. Thanks to this group of scholars and writers, the knowledge acquired from the Arab, Greek and Hebrew texts found its way into the heart of the universities in Europe.

Well,

[GDP growth rate](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp-growth)

As we can see in the graph, Greece was operating for the first time in years with a primary surplus. The drop at Q4 2014 can be explained due to the fact that the government at the time lost momentum after losing the elections for the European Parliament and because the internal pressure was too high with Syriza even calling the citizens not to pay their taxes because they would rip appart the memorandum once they came to power.

[Fifth IMF Review for Greece](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr14151.pdf)

&gt; Developments: Significant progress has been made toward rebalancing the economy. The fiscal primary and external current account balances are in surplus. **Investor sentiment has improved, and the government successfully placed a medium-term bond. The economy is poised to grow in 2014, after six years of deep recession. All this bodes well for a potentially virtuous cycle of recovery to take hold.** But a number of challenges remain to be overcome before stabilization is deemed complete and Greece is on a sustained and balanced growth path. The real exchange rate remains overvalued, and non-tourism exports are relatively weak. Banks face a mountain of bad loans that will require adequate capital and oversight to clean up, absent which the prospects are of a prolonged deleveraging antithetical to the assumed recovery. Fiscal gaps are projected for 2015–16, and public debt remains very high. 

&gt; Policies: **The authorities over-performed significantly on their 2013 fiscal primary balance target, achieving a surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP.** Although the carryover of the over-performance to 2014 is small, **the authorities are on track to achieve this year’s target**. They are implementing a number of structural reform commitments, with a notable acceleration of product and service market liberalization,
 where progress has lagged. However, in the area of labor market reforms, where Greece has made important progress in the past, the program is now falling short of targets. Following the Bank of Greece’s stress tests, the HFSF buffer has been set aside to safeguard financial stability, and ambitious steps are planned to strengthen the private debt resolution framework. Reforms to tax codes have been legislated, aimed at simplifying the system and making tax administration easier and, thus, addressing longstanding weaknesses. But at the same time, the authorities need to guard against pressure to rollback progress. On public administration reform, progress is mixed as Greece is struggling to introduce performance-based management and address the taboo against mandatory dismissals. 

The summary pretty much states that, while there are some issues and delays in certain reforms, the government has been doing pretty well thus far.

Page 45 of the report recommends 2 billion measures for 2015. These 2 billion measures were projected to lead to a 3% GDP growth. The Hardouvelis mail, which crucified the previous government, was arguing that 900 million measures would be sufficient but this is unimportant.

null,false,shackleton1,EURO,European Union,null,"I don't agree with it, but there's a perfectly reasonable explanation.

The rationale is that parents do not have the expertise or knowledge to properly police their children's access to the internet. For a parent, an internet filter is pretty useful. In past times, you could stick a computer in a shared space and be done, but now with internet on phones it's quite difficult to monitor a child's internet activity (remembering a child is anything up to 18).

So for a parent, a filter is an unintrusive way to prevent their children accessing certain material on the internet.

There are many commercial filters, but the IT illiterate won't know about them, won't know how to configure them, won't know where to get them, won't know how to install them on a phone etc.

So the government requires that ISPs provide people with a filter that they can use. It's optional, of course, you don't have to have it on. So the main focus of the policy - an optional filter - is absolutely fine.

The slight issues with it are that it's on by default. This requires people to effectively ring up their ISP and ""opt in"" to dodgy content. Not something most people want to do. Further, the filter itself is far from perfect. It filters things it shouldn't, and doesn't filter things it should, although you could argue that it's better than nothing.

The governments reasons for having it on by default:

- Parents may not have the expertise to know how to get it turned on. They may not know what an ISP is, they may not know about the filter etc etc.
- If you have several devices owned by several family members and those devices potentially have different ISPs, chasing them all up could be a pain (especially for the IT illiterate).

One of the rarely talked about reasons for not allowing same sex marriage is that you would have to completely overhaul the family law which in itself presents a lot of problems, legally and most importantly politically. As of now it is the law of the land, that a child born into a marriage is the automatically assumed to be the husbands child. Now imagine a lesbian couple using articial insemination... who is supposed to be the father. And you cannot legally give up your rights to the kid in advance... Now you may be constitutionally able to change the law, which is not a given, since there is a constitutional right of the kid to know its biological descendants... so lets just say there are are certain problems arising from a chisma between legal fiction and biological truth. 

And then there is the political problem of how to treat gay guys in regards to that, because they would only be able to have kids if surrogate mothership was allowed which is banned as of now. So... it isnt just a simple matter of lets allow gay marriage and see what happens thing.

&gt; And why not equally promote, or equally not promote, all the different life choices?

Because they are not legally binding choices. The idea being, that entering into a legal contract by way of marriage or civil union, there are certain legal responsibilities, most notably having to financially care for your spouse. Which at times can be costly, so the states has a vested interest in not spending its tax money on avoidable expenses.",null,0,null,1436951385,null,0,1436952592,0,ct3z1lb,null,t3_3dbwe3,null,t1_ct3z1lb,null,t1_ct3sk9d,null,null,null,1437866769,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

Well, I agree that it probably wouldn't provoke a military conflict...but then Russia doesn't gain anything.  It antagonizes a lot of people around the world, probably gets caught a couple of times...for what?  A poorer Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania that dislikes it more-strongly?

I can understand Russia wanting land and the property on it and the assets that the people there produce.  I can understand Russia wanting strategically-valuable land or water.  I can understand Russia wanting natural resources.  I can understand Russia wanting to neutralize potential future threats.  I can even understand Russia wanting to try to establish a ""do something that I don't like and I will hurt you"" reputation.  There's at least some sort of plausible rationale for all of those things.

But I can't see how trying to make the Baltics miserable buys Russia anything that would be useful to Russia.

Besides, what the article is discussing is whether there is a military threat to the Baltics from Russia.

&gt; Also: Finland, seriously? 

Sure.  Finland's obvious major military concern is Russia; whether it's [running hypothetical military scenarios](https://disciplescientist.wordpress.com/2015/03/04/what-if-russia-demands-a-naval-base-in-finland/) or [responding to Russian exercises](http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/european-war-games-responses-russian-military-drills-314410).

I'm no an IR expert, but I'd say wars happen when a country believes that it is better-off attacking now than later, when a window of opportunity is shutting -- whether it is World War I countries with closing windows of mobilization, or Japan wanting to move in World War II before its military fuel supplies were exhausted or European powers stopped being tied up with Germany.

In Ukraine, if Ukraine were to do a Baltics and join NATO, the window would shut; any Russian attack needed to happen soon, and so Russia moved.

If an EU military shows up -- commenters here enjoy linking to various officials talking about further military integration -- that will increase the chance of European intervention in Finland in the event of any future conflict.  If Finland joins NATO, it will pretty much shut the window entirely for Russia to do anything with hard power.

Russia is already spending a great deal of its money on its military, and has committed to further building its military.  It has no real reason to do that unless it is worried that something will threaten it or if it wants to threaten something else: otherwise, it would be more sensible to, for example, build up Russia's very-limited road infrastructure or do something else that would be likely to provide a return.

What realistic conflicts does Russia face?  Well, it's already established conflict or frozen conflict in two of its neighbors -- Georgia and Ukraine, and can already comfortably handle them.  Mongolia, as I understand it, has traditionally been Russia-affiliated, and has no meaningful military.  The remainder are Russian allies or NATO members, other than Finland, Azerbaijan ([maybe](http://www.todayszaman.com/world_azerbaijan-says-will-face-russian-soldiers-in-karabakh-in-case-of-war_308523.html)!), North Korea, and China.

I don't understand the Moscow-Chechnya relationship, so maybe civil war is a concern.  Russia [has been running very large-scale military exercises](http://www.newsweek.com/russia-and-nato-war-games-gap-310178) for the past two years, much larger than anything that NATO has done.  Russia just ran [one large exercise in the Arctic](https://news.vice.com/article/russias-massive-military-exercise-in-the-arctic-is-utterly-baffling), but all Arctic nations other than Sweden, Finland, and Russia are NATO members: either you're assuming that Russia is willing to scrap with NATO -- which seems unlikely -- or that it has an interest in demonstrating or ensuring ability to fight one of Sweden or Finland.

Should this be read as ""I think Russia is going to attack Finland?""  No, but then, I also wouldn't have said that Russia was going to attack Ukraine, either.  I am saying that Russia has attacked two of its neighbors, is building up its military again, and there are a limited set of realistic opponents...and I don't think that the Baltics are plausible targets, as the author seems to think.

There was no emergency liquidity mechanism in the eurozone, so that caused most bond interest rates in the EZ to spike. That's a clear construction fault in the EZ, not Greece's fault. In addition, it was bailing out bankrupt banks that pushed them over the edge... again, it's rather hypocritical to blame states for debts when the debts come from the private sector.

Yeah, fuck democracy, right? Tsipras knew he couldn't in good conscience sign a deal that was the exact opposite of his campaign promises.

Bei uns fährt keiner Auto, von daher übernachten wir eher in größeren Städten mit gescheitem ÖPNV.

An was ich noch etwas erinnern kann ist York, natürlich guter Ausgangspunkt für Yorkshire. Da gibt's auch genug Berge und ländliches. Und Städte gibt's auch noch. Letztes habe ich mal einen Tagesausflug nach Durham gemacht, das sollte nicht so weit von York weg sein, war ganz nett. Mehr kann ich zu Yorkshire leider nicht mehr sagen, damals war ich noch zu jung.

Wenn du nicht so weit weg willst kann man sich auch in Kent gut amüsieren. Damals haben wir in Canterbury übernachtet. Anfahrt z.B. mit dem Zug möglich. Dafür bucht man bei der DB ein London Spezial, ab 59 € in der 2. Klasse, 5 € Rabatt mit Bahncard 25. Muss man aber bis London buchen, einfach in Brüssel Midi die Umsteigezeit so auswählen, dass man einen Zug erwischt der in Ashford hält. Dort am Bahnhof dann die internationale Fahrkarte vorzeigen, und nach einem *EURO STD RETURN* fragen, kostet 13,40 GBP, hin gültig am angegebenen Tag, Rückfahrt innerhalb 2 Monate. Das dürfte am günstigsten sein, weil sonst nur Tickets für Rückfahrt am selben Tag verkauft werden. Man kann natürlich auch bis Ebbsfleet oder London fahren, das kostet aber natürlich mehr. Fahrt erfolgt dann auch über die Hochgeschwindigkeitslinie.  
Dort ham sie auch altes Zeugs, man kann auch an der Küste z.B. an den Cliffs of Dover wandern. Möglicher Tagesausflug (habe ich schon mal von London aus gemacht) ist z.B. Calais. Kostenpunkt 22,30 GBP, Rückfahrt muss am selben Tag erfolgen, nur Handgepäck. Erhältlich am Bahnhofschalter. Enthält Zugfahrt nach Dover Priory, P&amp;O Fähre von Dover nach Calais und zurück, keine Transfers enthalten. Verbuchung nicht erforderlich.

Ohne Familie war ich dann noch in East Anglia. Anfahrt damals per Eurostar, Fahrkarte London Norwich habe ich bei der DB gebucht, lohnt sich so aber nicht mehr. In der Gegend ist es nunmal flach. Dafür gibt es altes Zeugs in Ely und Cambridge ist auch nicht weit weg. Man kommt dort auch mit der Fähre hin. Stena Line fährt Hoek van Holland (bei Rotterdam) nach Harwich.

Mehr Urlaube in England habe ich (noch) nicht gemacht (heute Abend geht es los in Richtung Cornwall). Falls du aber Fragen wegen der Bahnanreise nach GB hast (bzw. generell GB), kannst du mich gerne fragen. Ich mache das mittlerweile immer wenn es nach Hause geht, ist normal sogar günstiger für mich als fliegen. Durchgängige Fahrkarten inklusive Schiff kann die DB leider nicht mehr verkaufen. Vom Festland ist das nur noch von jeder holländischen Station nach East Anglia möglich, aber die Fahrkarten verschicken sie nicht mehr nach außerhalb der Niederlande, höchstens wenn du erst ab dem Hafen buchst.

Edit: [hier nochmal was, was ich mal geschrieben habe, ldoer auf englisch.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/37twfg/z/crpz0vk)

Achja, wenn du mehr als 90 GBP Fahrkartenkosten hast, schau mal, ob irgendeine der britischen Railcards für dich geeignet wäre, die können direkt am Schalter ausgestellt werden.

I think ""perfectly well"" is pushing it a bit. :)

That the Eurozone is incomplete is well understood, and has been since before the introduction of the euro. It needs a transfer mechanism to compensate for the lack of adjustments that would otherwise happen through the exchange rate. But for transfers to be politically viable, we need fiscal integration, and for that to be legitimate we need political integration. Like transfers, this kind of sovereignty pooling is unpopular, which is why it hasn't been done yet. It's easier to introduce a common currency than it is to get nations to agree to give up sovereignty, *especially* budgetary sovereignty, both in terms of domestic spending and in terms of transfers.

On the one hand, the current crisis is a good opportunity to finally tackle this issue, and the first small steps have already been taken (e.g., banking union). On the other, both fiscal and sovereignty transfers are sort of sore spots right now -- especially as long as the Northern public isn't convinced that Greece will reform.

That Hollande talked about a Erozone parliament yesterday is a sign that this might be on the table soon. There had been some previous attempts to use the crisis to get the ball rolling in 2012 (e.g., by Merkel), but nothing came out of it at the time.

What I am arguing in this thread is, more or less, that we need a deal with an equivalent exchange of duties. Germans expect something in return for their money. I believe the certainty that Greece would reform and not be in need of constant transfers would do much to mellow german public opinion.

And while Schaubles handling of the crisis was heavy handed and unhelpful, I wouldn't say that the german public has turned away from the idea of the EU. After all, they were promised ""no bailouts"", and still they payed up for ""greek mistakes"".

But if germans get in their head that the EU is a ""debt union"" without accountability for the debtors, I expect anti-european sentiment to rise in Germany.

This  is how I see it: A complete bailout for Greece on Greece terms and with scarce conditions attached would be a bad idea for the EU.

Es gab dann einen Gegenvorschlag von Griechenland zu dem abgelehnten (der aber soweit ich das beurteilen kann diesem fast genau entsprach), der aber aus Prinzip abgelehnt wurde (erinnert so n bisschen an den Scherz mit ""Sie sind gefeuert""-""Sie können mich nicht feuern, ich kündige"").

Cuts in Greece were far, far harsher than in those countries.

It's a vague excuse, ideal to keep moving the goalposts. They always ask reforms, but the deal always breaks on ""not enough cuts"". Not to mention that it wasn't a problem during the five years of Pasok and ND, but suddenly a hot issue when Syriza came into power.

Not sure exactly what you mean by this. My feeling (as a Greek) is that wages should be commensurate with output...aka market driven. From that perspective, wages in Greece should be much lower than wages in Germany. However, that also means that wages in Germany should be higher than they currently are...to drive consumption and expand its market. Lower wages in Greece would incentivize local production...and any increase in output both domestic and export oriented should also lead to wage increase.

The peculiarity of Greece is that it's high average wages are driven by an enormous public sector with ridiculously high wages. The private sector was always much lower and, on it's own, sustainable. Cut the public sector size and wages and the problem is almost resolved. (Of course reforms are critical to boost private sector competitiveness).

However, as things stand, even if Greece managed to do this the continuation of downward pressure on wages among the rich north will ensure disequilibrium. 

I understand that Germany is making cautious moves in that direction...however, the continued policy of austerity at the expense of growth renders such moves moot from Greece's perspective.

If you add some of the more obtuse ones to the label, people would not take you serious anymore. But if you don't include them or explicitly exclude them via such a ranking, you are missing the support for your cause from these groups (and tumblrina still has impact on this, hard as it is to imagine). Plus, a lot of social justice runs on the Internet Hate Machine. If you explicitly exclude say demisexuals, there is a good chance an internet campaign for your job and livelyhood gets started.

&gt; Vedo che nel tuo programma è escluso completamente lo zucchero

Sì, io non lo uso mai... Non penso sia fondamentale, gli zuccheri ci sono già nella farina e preferisco non stravolgere le cose (anche l'olio ormai praticamente lo evito). Poi, ripeto, quel tool è una *bischerata*, giusto per far 2 conti :)

&gt; Ho anche sentito che consigliano l'acqua gasata. Però certi dicono fredda, altri dicono temperatura ambiente o tiepida, infine leggo anche che l'acqua gasata va bene, ma non quella effervescente naturale.

Acqua normale va benissimo, temperatura ambiente (o addirittura fredda se vuoi rallentare ulteriormente la lievitazione)... Alla fine, per quanto possa sembrare contro senso, tutte le indicazioni vanno nella direzione di rallentare la lievitazione (da cui il sale che va messo in quantità subito, come prima cosa).

&gt; Immagino sia Notturno italiano. Quindi in sole 6 ore si riesce a fare?

Si, scusa ero da mobile... Comunque si fa anche in 6, pompando un po' con il lievito... Meglio sarebbe almeno 12hr.

&gt; Ma per la temperatura ambiente non cambia nulla se ci sono 30°C o 25°C? Vedo che in Pizza 2 Calc ne tengono conto.

In realtà sì... Conta eccome, però io ho messo dei valori indicativi medi (validi per una 20ina di gradi), poi semmai metto qualcosa meno o più.

&gt; Però non saprei neanche come pesare quella quantità infinitesimale di lievito che indicano. Ho la bilancia elettronica, ma non indica i valori con la virgolla.

You need a form of ""positive money"", money that people can save which is not another's debt. I think you've cottoned on to that, but you've missed the more important but more subtle point: debt of the currency issuer (eg the US federal gov't) is not a debt in any meaningful sense. It's just money the gov't's spent that it hasn't yet taxed out of existence, money that the gov't isn't going to run out of. It's savings, that the rest can hold.

That is, currency issuing governments are not revenue constrained in their borrowing. Nobody looks at the Japanese gov'ts nonsensical books before loaning it more yen, they loan it yen because there can literally be no safer place to store your yen. The debt of currency issuing governments then is not a concern, but the savings it represents - the savings the non-government get to hold - can facilitate a whole heap of transactions allowing the population to stay employed.

That's the prime difference between a monetary union where every entity is revenue constrained in their ability to borrow, and a federal system where there's an entity at the level of the currency-issuer. The latter is sustainable, the former leads to mass unemployment.",null,0,null,1436954164,null,0,false,0,ct3zomf,null,t3_3dcnoe,null,t1_ct3zomf,null,t1_ct3zapb,null,null,null,1440479172,null,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13,null

LOL, did you see the deal they got?  Have you seen the forecasts of their long term fucking that their country is agreeing to?

If you don't think that is a reason to panic, I don't know what is.

&gt;Why would you prefer if YV instead of trying to play it cool, said 'no we are fucked, the banks will remain closed until we accept the creditors proposals, the referendum is a waste of time'?

At that point, I'd prefer him to tell the truth instead of lying for clear political gain.

Is this really that crazy of a suggestion?

&gt;Well, I think plenty of people were surprised that the ECB elected to contribute to the financial instability in Greece instead of acting to mitigate it. 

I don't think you know what the word ""contribute"" means.

Typically, it *doesn't* mean a simple lack of additional assistance.  For example, if I can't pay my bills and you won't pay them for me, it would be stupid to say that *you* contributed.

&gt;At no point when I heard that interview did I think YV was lying.

Well that just means that he was an effective liar.

I mean, based on what we had seen so far and what the ECB had been saying for months, what exactly was the basis to think that the ECB would bail the banks out after the referendum?

&gt; Clearly he was wrong, but to err is human.

Again, what exactly was the basis to think that the ECB would bail the banks out after the referendum?  Everything I pointed to other than the pro-Syriza propaganda made it seem pretty clear that it wasn't going to happen.

&gt;So besides this example, which as I said I do not find convincing at all, what else have you got? If this is it, I don't think it is enough to make a case on.

There is certainly more but I doubt that it will do much good.  I mean, there was no serious indication that I could see that would suggest the ECB would restart funding after the referendum.  Absolutely none.  

If you saw some, you sure haven't shared it.  Instead, you've dishonestly portrayed it as ""contributing"" when that isn't the case.  

If you can't support your stance with facts and you have to dishonestly portray the situation and then use this as the basis for saying my example isn't convincing, I doubt you would believe anything I put forth, no matter how cut and dried.

&gt;Or let me ask an inversion of the question: what evidence would you need to see to believe YV is not the liar you claim?

On the bank issue?

Show me evidence or logic that the ECB would give the funds needed for the banks to reopen on Tuesday other than the fact that plenty of people were surprised.  I mean, V. is pretty smart.  There was absolutely no indication that I've seen anywhere to suggest that he should have actually expected the banks to re-open, but I'll look at whatever you have to present.",null,0,null,1436954180,null,0,false,0,ct3zopy,null,t3_3d8zt7,null,t1_ct3zopy,null,t1_ct3d2ab,null,null,null,1437867238,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

**Brussels proposes using EU rescue fund to help Greece**

Peter Spiegel and Alex Barker in Brussels and Elizabeth Rigby in London



The European Commission has submitted a formal proposal to use an EU-wide rescue fund to rush aid to Greece to ensure Athens does not default on Monday, a proposal that will force Britain’s prime minister, David Cameron, to rally allies if he wants to block it.
According to an EU official, the commission submitted the plan late on Tuesday after determining it was the best option to avoid Greece defaulting on a €3.5bn bond Athens owes the European Central Bank. If Athens were to default on that bond, the ECB would be forced to pull emergency loans keeping the Greek banking sector afloat.

“It’s the most European, politically and economically sound, readily available option,” said the EU official. “Without it, there is a risk the euro summit [agreement] won’t work.”

The commission’s decision comes despite angry objections to the plan by George Osborne, the UK chancellor, who at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels on Tuesday called the plan “a non-starter”. 

Downing Street is furious that the commission is risking inflaming British public opinion ahead of the UK’s referendum on EU membership, which will be held by 2017. 

Under the EU’s Byzantine voting rules, Mr Osborne must now rally a weighted majority of fellow EU members to block the proposal. Although he has the support of some other non-euro countries — both Denmark and Sweden registered their objections at Tuesday’s meeting — it is unlikely that at present Downing Street has sufficient allies to block the plan.

Even the formal attempt by Brussels to use this fund is a big political setback. Mr Cameron has trumpeted securing a “black and white” promise in 2011 that the fund would be mothballed so British taxpayers would not be part of eurozone bailouts.

The EU-wide fund, the European Financial Stability Mechanism, was set up at the outset of the eurozone crisis with €60bn in lending capacity.

When the eurozone moved to set up a new, permanent rescue fund for the currency union’s 19 members, Mr Cameron won agreement at an EU summit that the EFSM would never be used again for eurozone rescues. 

But EU lawyers have argued that the 2012 deal was a political agreement, not a legal one, allowing them to re-tap the fund.

This commission approach potentially undercuts one of the legal avenues British officials are exploring to enshrine reforms to Britain’s EU membership terms. Given formal treaty changes are unlikely before the referendum, Britain may need to rely on a decision by EU leaders, exactly the type of political promise the commission are disregarding in the case of the EFSM. 

A government figure said on Wednesday that the UK remained firmly opposed and that the chancellor was “immovable” on principle that British taxpayers’ money would not be used to bail out Greece. “We are not trying to be obstructive but it us a eurozone issue.”

One official involved in negotiating the EFSM decision in 2011 said the commission’s proposal demonstrated that joint declarations by EU leaders “are worthless” until the laws and treaties are changed. 

The EFSM distributed €48.5bn as part of Ireland’s and Portugal’s rescue, meaning it has about €11.5bn remaining. Greece needs €7bn by Monday to make the ECB bond payment plus interest, and reimburse the International Monetary Fund for €2bn in arrears.

Yes, but then the reason he gives for saying ""all"" if it has to actually apply to ""all"" of it or he is lying.

Again, this is what the word ""all"" means.  This isn't that hard.  ""All"" doesn't mean ""some"" or ""only this last little part"".

Let me get this straight.

He said that he was told all of it by Schauble.  He wasn't told all of it by Schauble.  I claim this makes him a liar.  I'm engaging in abstraction for actually applying the meaning of ""all"" and you are being rational for using ""all"" to mean ""not all, only this very limited portion"".

In other words, the German government would only pay back its creditors when it could afford to and not by borrowing even more money. Reimbursements were also limited to 3% of export earnings. So, this set a cap on repayments allowing Germany to use the excess as it saw fit.

Not really.  He said he was told it ""all"" by Schauble.

I take that to mean that he lied.

That's about a basic as you can get.

The only reason that it is getting complicated is because you, and other insist on interpreting ""all"" to mean ""not all, but only this limited portion"".

Support that.

I just want to point out two aspects:

- Christmas and Easter bonuses, as far as I know, were full salaries. This means they still get 70% of a monthly salary twice a year?

- the public wages, as far as I understand, and please correct me if I am reading wrong, have not actually been cut. For comparison, in Romania, after having various bonuses cut, public employees took a 25% cut of already really low salaries. This swift measure allowed, along with others (such as 24% VAT), for the country to bounce back quite quickly from the crisis. I think the Greeks simply need to cut a lot more if they want to return to growth. 

EDIT - In support of what I wrote above, a more detailed list of austerity measures implemented just in 2010 by Romania

- 25% cut for state employees, including bonuses and other rights (very few if at all type of bonuses were retained, not even bonuses such as those for doctors working in high contagion risk environments);

- 15 % cut for unemployment welfare and child support; 

- freeze for pensions for 2010 and 2011;

- VAT hike from 19% to 24%;

People should stop saying 'he got something, I want it aswell' but rather say 'there is a debt relief needed for reasons a,b,c&amp;d'. 

&gt;  a waiver from outstanding war reparations plus Marshall Plan aid

I guess you are talking about the WW1 reparations here. Germany payed reparations for WW2 actually. Even to greece, though the greek people responsible totally fucked this up. The marshall aid was actually a loan to Germany which had to be repayed (the largest part, we recieved 1.4 billion and payed back 1 billion). 

&gt; As for the remaining debt, repayment was conditional on running a trade surplus

This however is not possible with greece as they never ran a trade surplus and likely wont do it for the next two decades either.

&gt; In other words, the German government would only pay back its creditors when it could afford to and not by borrowing even more money

Somewhat true.

&gt; Reimbursements were also limited to 3% of export earnings.

The difference is that Germany actually *had* significant export earnings, making 3% sufficient, contrary to greece. If greece spent 10% of its export earnings on its debt, we would still sit here in a thousand years. 

&gt; This also gave Germany’s creditors an incentive to import German goods so they would later get their money back, thereby laying the foundations of the country’s powerful export sector.

They had access to machinery from the WW2-area though, a somewhat solid foundation. Unfortunately this kind of project wont work in Greece, what are they going to export? 

&gt; All of this was done to generate growth. 

True. Growth and thus repayment of debts.


&gt; Therein lies the true difference...not the amounts....the intent.

We could argue about the intent. The US had a vital interest in Germany becoming a stronghold against communism, which would not have worked without a strong economy. They also saw the prospects for this to work. Greece on the other side has proven to be a hostile place for investments. All major attempts of building an industry in Greece have been ruined by either the government, the workers or the authorities.

You realize that hose are not mutually exclusive, right?

&gt; Or are you trying to say that the Greeks had to cut their pensions so they could pay their pensions?

That is EXACTLY what I'm saying. The Greeks had to cut their pensions (reduce the amount per person) so they could pay them (so they would have enough money to pay everybody).

&gt; Cuts in Greece were far, far harsher than in those countries.

Might be, I don't know the details page by page. I know that Greece's situation was worse, so maybe the harsher cuts were necessary.

I can't really speak for Russia, but perhaps my impressions of Estonia 10-20 years ago are similar enough.

Unless the property is specifically bought recently as investment property, it is not thought of as part of ""net worth"". The same goes for personal retirement funds.

A lot (perhaps even the majority) of people live in large concrete towers, which used to be government-owned apartment blocks, and were privatised as condos to the residents pretty much ""for free"". The same goes for summer houses - some of these might be family farms, some might be cottages received as favours during soviet times. So even if they have a market value, people might have never checked to see what it is. The summer homes are part of family traditions, and nobody sells them unless in desperate need. And people who have moved home, or new families who buy new homes still need at least one place to live - so you can't freely use that value.

The same goes for retirement savings accounts. Mandatory personal retirement funds were introduced here about 15 years ago, and for young people only - so most people still rely exclusively on government-provided retirement. And people who do have retirement funds are pretty suspicious about how much they can actually cash out 30-40 years later. These retirement funds are not thought of as part of ""net worth"" either.

So when people talk about wealth, they consider mostly only liquid assets: cash in bank accounts, freely tradable shares and stocks, and *perhaps* ownership of non-tradable private companies.

English isn't your first language, is it?

&gt;That context matters more than your supposed targeted audience (which is a reach, at best).

So then ""which is a reach, at best"" either means that:

&gt;That context matters more than your supposed targeted audience

is a reach or my claim about what the supposed target audience is is a reach.

Neither of those are the same as:

&gt;ignoring the context in the text and claiming an intended audience as being the only context is a reach.

What are you missing?

&gt;'That context matters more than' - the context of the dialog matters more (for interpreting the meaning of the word) than 'your supposed targeted audience' - the so-called context you are ranting about. 

Agreed that this is what that part meant.

&gt;'Which is a reach at best' refers to your claim that the target audience is the only context to use when deciding the most accurate translation of the word he used.

Support this part, since I never said it was the only context to use.  I just said that, in this case, it outweighed the rest.

Additionally, *if* that is what the reach comment referred to, how do you get that from:

&gt;That context matters more than your supposed targeted audience (which is a reach, at best).

That comment doesn't contain any mention of my claim so how can the ""reach"" comment possibly refer to it?

&gt;  Get it yet? I doubt it. Please don't ever become a translator, you'd be terrible at it.

I get that you are talking out of your ass because you are too arrogant to admit that you fucked up.

The reason why people make the mistake on thinking that there was nothing in the west during middle-ages is that there was no single empire and capital that would have been built with enormous monuments. However in the west what you had was enormous amount of distributed development. Most of the development happened in regional level and was concentrated on building castles, fortifying small towns, building cathedrals, water works, etc... In cases where kingdoms were more prosperous and had more resources, new grand monuments were build, for example [Norte Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Paris) in Paris. This huge amount of development that was achieved was darkened with the arrival of black plague that killed huge number of population, and took the next 150 years for the populations to recover.

No. Followup answer below. 

&gt; No, I don't think they everyone did know that. You are just speculating and you expect me to agree?

But any person (especially an economist) should know that nobody should utter the words ""the banks will open within 24 hours"" or ""an agreement will be reached 48 hours after a no"" or ""I personally guarantee the people's deposits"" when that is not within their hands.

Like it or not, the banks can only open with euros only when the creditors give the green light. This is yet to happen because the agreement has not been finalized.

Additionally, everyone had made it clear that since we are no longer talking about a program extension, the process of drafting and passing a 3rd bailout package through each and every national parliament takes time. Hell, even the Greek parliament cannot pass the agreement within 24 hours.

&gt; The fact that you think this is a 'rebellion' is a problem itself.

Governmental members were talking about a war, about capitulation (συνθηκολόγηση). So yes, according to their own words, rebellion against the ""evil"" creditors seems appropriate. As for me, I do not think it is a rebellion; just a terrible diplomatic ability.

&gt; I mean, you think austerity is working or what? Last I saw, annual GDP growth in Germany is around 0.1% - what an economic miracle!

[Greek GDP growth](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp-growth)

In fact, Greece was the fastest growing economy in the Eurozone last year. The previous government started stalling the reforms after losing the European Parliament elections and when Tsipras made it clear that he would force elections by not voting for a President. Syriza was also telling people that they should not pay their taxes because they would rip apart the memorandum from the first day of their governance.

According to the infamous IMF reports, the debt was sustainable back in 2014.

&gt; None other than, ""it's either this, or nothing as we fall apart as a state"". In many ways, it's the same for the EU.

Many EU-citizens in richer countries, believe they could do very good without the EU. Some even believe their country would be better outside of the EU. 

There's not that perceived choice between hardship and more hardship that Greece is facing. 

If countries like Germany, France or the UK leave the EU to join EEA, it wouldn't change that much for them. They would lose some advantages and some disadvantages. For such countries the stance on EU integration is driven more by idealism than necessity. At least it is perceived that way by the individual citizens.  



It'll be very hard to push for more integration without changing the peoples mind about the European project.

I've never seen anyone make that argument, and given how users typically arrive at infringing downloads I don't see how it could possibly hold up in court. You don't have a right to a private copy when the source is obviously published illegally, and everyone knows that movie studios don't put their films on shady internet sites for free.

This could be relevant in some edge cases, like if it turned out that a service like onlinetvrecorder.com was illegal, where legality hinges on fine details that have occupied the courts for years, but for the usual avenue of going on Usenet or some torrent or link aggregator with a dozen porn and scam ads there's really no question.

There is however a good legal argument for *streaming* being legal, but it's unrelated to private copies and based on §44a UrhG and argues that the copy in the cache is only a temporary copy that is incidential to the technical process of viewing the video, which would be allowed since mere viewing is always a legal use.",null,0,null,1436958050,null,0,1436959722,0,ct40m9q,null,t3_3cy0we,null,t1_ct40m9q,null,t1_ct0nowm,null,null,null,1437867921,null,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1,null

Reality: very few people expected the ECB to act like a mafia enforcer for the troika. It will be interesting in the coming years to hear memoirs of Draghi and see who was really behind this and what was the legal basis they used.

The situation before our prime minister (David Cameron) escalated the situation was that all Internet service providers [ISPs] (the people you pay to literally get access to the Internet) had filters available so that house holds with children, or public places which provide Internet (libraries, coffee shops, etc) could block certain times of inappropriate content at source, if they wanted to. Phone companies had already had these filters on by default (ergo: you can't use the 3G on your phone to look at porn, unless you specifically ask our phone company to allow it) but house ISPs didn't put the filters on by default. People buying services from the ISPs had to specifically tell the ISP that they wanted to have the filter enabled. 

All Cameron did was make it so that ISPs selling internet to households would have the filter on by default, like it already was for phone companies. 

The justification is just the good ol' ""protect children"" from obscene imagery that they shouldn't be exposed to at such a young age, etc. 

----

The reason I'm saying this is because a lot of people seem to think that you can't view porn in the UK anymore, which is completely and categorically false. 

I personally don't like the policy and I think that it should be opted out of by default, with families specifically opting in, but I also think that people are making this out to be something that it's not and that we should remain grounded. If we start creating an imaginary problem which we're fighting against, then it's going to get us nowhere.

Following Alex Tsipras’ humiliating capitulation to the Troika this Monday, one can imagine governments across Europe breathing a collective sigh of relief, tinged no doubt with a little schadenfreude. The loudest sigh was probably not in Berlin, as one might suspect, but in Madrid where the scandal-tarnished Rajoy government arguably had most to lose from a Syriza triumph (or even half-triumph), with general elections lurking just around the corner.

As the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis just admitted to the New Statesman, he and Tspiras chronically underestimated the strength of opposition to a new Greek debt deal among the governments of fellow peripheral nations Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland.

“The greatest nightmare” of those with large debts – the governments of countries like Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland – “was our success”. “Were we to succeed in negotiating a better deal that would obliterate them politically: they would have to answer to their own people why they didn’t negotiate like we were doing.”

Unlike Syriza, Spain’s government has happily danced to the Troika’s tune throughout its tenure. The result, according to Spain’s Premier Mariano Rajoy, has been an unprecedented economic turnaround – one which, in the words of his Minister of Finance and Public Administration, Cristobal Montoro, should serve as an example to the world.

On paper Rajoy and Montoro may have a point. Spain’s economy does indeed appear to be firing on all cylinders. In its latest quarterly economic outlook, the Spanish bank BBVA revised upward its GDP growth forecast for Spain from 2.7% to 3% in 2015. This is no mean achievement for an economy that just three years ago was in the deepest throes of recession.

An Economic Fairy Tale

There is just one problem with this storyline – GDP growth in Spain, as elsewhere, tells only part of the story, albeit an important one. While almost everyone (economists, journalists, eurocrats, Troikaytes and even many Spanish citizens) desperately clings to the dream that the worst is over, they wilfully ignore one niggling fact — namely, that the government’s version of events is riddled with gaping holes:

“Many Little Greeces.” Since Rajoy won the last elections in November, 2011, Spain’s public debt has grown at a faster rate than any time in its post-Franco history. A staggering €590 billion – the equivalent of 30 percentage points – have been added to the country’s total debt during the last three and a half years of government-imposed “austerity.”

Mariano Rajoyflickr / Partido Popular de Cantabria

Government spending at the regional level continues to spiral out of control. In the last year alone, the regional governments took on 27 billion dollars more debt, ending 2014 with a total combined debt of €236bn – equivalent to 22.4% of GDP. As El Economista warns, Spain consists of many little Greeces. Matters are hardly helped by the fact that the worst regions are also the hottest beds of corruption. They include Valencia, home to Spain’s most corrupt regional government which just suffered the ignominy of being the first Spanish region to be fined by Brussels for “manipulating its own budget”.

A Ballooning Deficit. With general elections fast approaching, Rajoy is on a mission: to buy as many votes as quickly as possible. Austerity has been suspended and spending is on the rise at both the local and national level while tax cuts previously slated for early next year have been brought forward. In exemplary political desperation, the government has even reinstalled part of the extra salary payments civil servants enjoyed during the pre-crisis years of plenty.

Chronic Unemployment. “How can they possibly call this a recovery when more than one in five people are still unemployed?” the financial director of a large utility recently asked me. As if to answer his own question, he added: “It’s a farce, an insult to the lowest intelligence.” As I recently reported, recovery-blessed Spain, not depression-hit Greece, currently boasts the three most unemployed regions in Europe. It is also the OECD member with the highest unemployment rate among the under-25s and the over-55s — once again, higher than Greece! In other words, Spain’s so-called recovery is the economic equivalent of Tacitus’ indelible line: “They make a desert and call it peace.”

A New Bank Bailout. Despite passing repeated ECB stress tests, Spain’s biggest banks, like most of Europe’s biggest banks, remain chronically undercapitalized. They are also home to massive and growing pools of festering debt. Recent estimates have put non-performing loans (NPLs) in Spain at around 9% to 10% of total bank credit – the equivalent, according to analysis by the Wall Street Journal, of approximately €120 billion. As I reported in It’s Getting Ugly in Spain, while the IMF seems outwardly happy for Rajoy &amp; Co to lure unsuspecting voters with the promise of across-the-board tax cuts, behind the scenes it is quietly preparing the groundwork for a new bank bailout – not just in Spain, but also in Italy.

Contagion from South America. Spain is by far the most exposed economy in the world to South America, a region that is slowing down. The region is the primary (if not sole) profit source of many of Spain’s biggest companies. Whereas HSBC, the world’s local bank, is withdrawing from the region as fast as it can pack its bags, Spain’s two biggest banks, Santander and BBVA, are doubling down on their bets. In September, if the Federal Reserve does the unthinkable – i.e. raise interests rates – it could well set off the mother of all capital outflows from across Latin America. If this happens, Spanish companies will feel the pain. Some may even need government assistance.

Since becoming prime minister Rajoy has repeatedly stated that Spain is not Greece. Nor is it Uganda, he said at one point, with his usual level of tact and diplomacy. In many ways, Rajoy is right: although it may have similar levels of corruption to Greece, Spain boasts a much larger, more advanced economy with higher levels of productivity, better infrastructure and a much bigger external market. As such, comparing the two is an almost pointless task.

But that’s not to say that Spain doesn’t suffer from its own enormous, potentially crippling set of political and economic problems, most of which have been swept under the rug of political expedience. In other words, Spain is Spain and that in itself should be reason enough to worry. By Don Quijones, Raging Bull-Shit.

There is no limit to how far our elected governments will go, and to what extent they will crack down on the little guy, to protect the interests and privileges of oligarchs and oligopolies. Red… The Men Who’re Stealing the Sun

Instead of recognising that you can't have a union without fiscal transfers centred around a surplus country as big as Germany that keeps siphoning real value from net import countries, we just keep acting that everything will be alright if we come up with more rules. The Maastricht criteria didn't work? Here's the Sixpack! We keep fighting basic macroeconomics with regulations, as if passing a law that says you can't have a budget deficit of over x% will erase the fact that import countries necessarily run deficits at least some of the time. It just creates institutional inertia because people keep saying that the rules work on paper, countries just don't stick to them well enough.

The problem with a lot of smaller Eastern European countries (including mine) is that we're very dependent on Germany economically and also all of our politicians are idiots. I mean that in a loving way, but most of them have no long term vision.

I was editing my previous post because I did not like my argument, sorry for that.

However, what made you think that the creditors would give funding to Greece less than 24 hours after a NO? You are aware that actually coming about a new program takes time right? 

Hell, the PMs came to an agreement on Sunday but there is still uncertainty whether the deal will happen.

&gt; Reality: very few people expected the ECB to act like a mafia enforcer for the troika. It will be interesting in the coming years to hear memoirs of Draghi and see who was really behind this and what was the legal basis they used.

Why? Draghi had said that he can only provide liquidity as long as Greece is in a program. You could argue that he should have waited for the 2nd bailout to finish to cut ELA (already at ~50% of our GDP) but, given that ELA had been cut, how can anyone expect that this stance would change 24 hours after a NO.

Say we just hand Greece a huge bundle of money and say ""Your debts are paid to the point where you can handle interest."", what happens then? Do the problems that caused the current crisis cease to be?  
My opinion is that no, they wont. Again, my opinion is that Greece desperately needs reforms. More of my opinion is that Greece had the massive amount of borrowing they did from 2001 to 2008 to cover implementation of reforms on their terms but apparently they didn't, or didn't do enough.  
If Greece gets their debt cut to manageable levels, spending commences and the Greek economy recovers, will Greece implement these reforms when everything is going well? I am honestly asking here because I don't know.  
I keep reading that tax collection is so low because the Greeks don't trust their own government because of corruption. If even the Greeks think their government is so corrupt that taxes just disappear, shouldn't they be first in line for someone to force reforms on the government? Isn't it in their interest that someone puts an end to the rampant corruption? If the local government hasn't been effective at taking care of this, wouldn't they want a government that will actually do this?  
These are not rhetorical questions. I am honestly very confused.

These circle jerks are often directed at the people and gross generalisations take place. It goes beyond a dislike for government policies and is just mocking the people. I may dig out some examples later.

Glaubst du Schäuble denn alles was er sagt? Ich hab da so meine Zweifel. Zumindest bei mir hat er diesen Ruf nicht.
Er muss ja nicht unbedingt direkt lügen, sondern kann auch mal was weg lassen was evtl. ein anderes Bild zeichnen würde.

Wenn er davon anfängt, dass die Banken essentiell für eine funktionierende Wirtschaft  sind, heißt es ja noch lange nicht, dass die derzeit bestehenden Bankenmodelle richtig sind und welche Schlüsse zieht er daraus?
Das lässt er mal schön unter den Tisch fallen und schwadroniert wieder sinngemäß von der Alternativlosigkeit der Bankenrettung.

Wenn er irgendwelche Gespräche hinter verschlossenen Türen anspricht in denen er oder andere etwas gesagt haben wollen, weiß man noch lange nichts über dessen Kontext. Durch partielles Zitieren kann man sich alles nach Wunsch hinbiegen.

While almost everyone (economists, journalists, eurocrats, Troikaytes and even many Spanish citizens) desperately clings to the dream that the worst is over, they wilfully ignore one niggling fact — namely, that the government’s version of events is riddled with gaping holes:

“Many Little Greeces.” Since Rajoy won the last elections in November, 2011, Spain’s public debt has grown at a faster rate than any time in its post-Franco history. A staggering €590 billion – the equivalent of 30 percentage points – have been added to the country’s total debt during the last three and a half years of government-imposed “austerity.”

But yeah.  Let's continue to champion austerity and pretend it is working because GDPs dropped 20 precent and are now up 2 or 3 percent.

[Historical GDP per capita](http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/Historical_Statistics/horizontal-file_02-2010.xls)

If we look at the year 1, GDP per capita based on regions of modern states

* 809$ in Italy
* 550$ in Turkey
* 550$ in Greece
* 473$ in France
* 408$ in Germany

In year 1000...

* 450$ in Italy
* 600$ in Turkey
* 400$ in Greece
* 425$ in France
* 410$ in Germany

In year 1500...

* 1100$ in Italy
* 600$ in Turkey
* 433$ in Greece
* 727$ in France
* 688$ in Germany

The point to make in here is that Rome and Byzantium were empires that enjoyed windfalls that their their large empires produced. When the Roman empire collapsed, the Italian GDP dropped until reorganization of its economy enabled it to produce more than at the high times of Rome. Now if you look at France and Germany, the core areas of Merovingian and Carolingian empires, they also suffered from the collapse of the Roman empire, but from 1000 to 1500 they were growing and producing more wealth. 

So definitely life in Byzantium was better after the collapse of the Roman empire, however the difference was not vast, and after western reorganization of kingdoms, administration and economy those new kingdom and countries grew very fast and rapidly.",null,0,null,1436960869,null,0,false,0,ct41ely,null,t3_3dbz8w,null,t1_ct41ely,null,t1_ct40n9q,null,null,null,1437868455,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

The EZ has been in a suppressed state for nearly as many years as it was out of it now. EZ members compare badly to any country with its own free floating currency and all debt denominated in its own currency that you care to name. It's beyond ""no downturns"" and into ""40%+ downturn"".

I suggest reading the whole report, but here is a quote: 

&gt; The current crisis in the euro area derives from a multitude of causes that have
given rise to a large variety of symptoms. In our view, there is a tendency to
over-simplify the origins of the crisis. Explanations focusing solely on wage-setting mistakes or fiscal irresponsibility, on the failure in banking practices
or banking regulation, on the failures in policy coordination or the application
of sanctions, will all only partially be right. For us, the root cause of the current
crisis lies in the contradiction between a single, supra-national currency and
the continuation of nation-state-based economic policies. This contradiction
has given rise to all the other “causes” of this crisis.

Problem is up to this point territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, etc) didn't have access to the same bankruptcy and debt restructuring mechanisms that states, cities, town, etc. have. 

--

During these restructuring meetings debt holders are often times collectively represented (or at least shares are; i.e. representative for 30% of debt). A deal of the majority (an agreement on a debt negotiation reached by a majority of debt holders can be imposed on all debt holders) can then be reached with all sides taking commensurate losses.

--

Both parties agree Puerto Rico ought to have access to these mechanisms (and they will). The split (as of right now) is over the priority: debt restructuring or economic restructuring.

--

Otherwise Puerto Rico -- like all states and territories -- controls its own budget. That said, being that Puerto Rico is a territory, not all federal law applies. Regulatory baselines and standards for various civic institutions (school, common law, jail, government, etc) may not apply. Being that these standards aren't enforced (remember: territory, not state) falling below baselines standards or regulation wouldn't trigger an economic response in the form of aid or assistance from Washington.

The Spanish deficit budget deficit was...

* 2015 projected to be 5.8%
* 2014 was 6.8%

The point in here is that Spain is in totally different position than Greece. True the Spanish position is not easy and for example ECB should continue QE and EU Commission should create an European Investment Fund to enable stimulation of the real economy and build needed infrastructure for economies of member states to grow. If Spain just continue to introduce market friendly reforms and cut public sector inefficiencies then just in few years the Spanish debt position relative to their GDP should start to become better.

I can't understand how on earth Tsipras and Varoufakis thought that the Spanish would be on board in their attempt, the Spanish would have nothing to gain from engaging into a ulta-leftist initiative that when succeeding would just make populist gain power in Spain and in worst case would drive the Eurozone under deadlock and jeopardize economical stability of all member states.",null,0,null,1436961929,null,0,false,0,ct41r71,null,t3_3dd89z,null,t1_ct41r71,null,t1_ct40q2y,null,null,null,1437868716,null,30,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,30,null

Nur zur Wiederholung mal die trockenen Fakten zitiert:
&gt;Vermutlich zehn Millionen Menschen in Deutschland konsumieren mehr Alkohol, als ihrer Gesundheit guttut; etwa 1,8 Millionen sind im engeren Sinne alkoholabhängig. Von den Gewalttaten wird ein Drittel unter Alkoholeinfluss begangen. Schaut man nur auf die Gewalttaten gegen die eigene Frau oder Freundin, liegt der Anteil alkoholisierter Männer bei weit über 50 Prozent. Betrunkene verursachen 15.000 Verkehrsunfälle im Jahr. 74.000 Todesfälle werden in Deutschland jährlich auf die direkten Folgen des Alkoholmissbrauchs zurückgeführt. Noch gar nicht darin enthalten ist die (öffentlich kaum bekannte) Zahl der Alkoholiker, die sich selbst das Leben nehmen: Sieben Prozent aller Alkoholkranken wählen aus Verzweiflung früher oder später den Tod.

Edit:

null,false,oiskin,null,null,null,"Der Artikel ist völlig überzogen und aufgebauscht. Die öffentlichen Auftritte eines Professors zu dokumentieren ist völlig legitim, genauso wie das anonyme Veröffentlichen von Kritiken an seinen Positionen (natürlich nur solange diese korrekt wiedergegeben werden). Man muss der Kritik ja nicht folgen. Baberowski mag ein ""angesehener Historiker"" sein, er ist vor allem auch ein umstrittener Historiker (u.a. wegen Aussagen wie [""Hitler war kein Psychopath, er war nicht grausam. Er wollte nicht, dass an seinem Tisch über die Judenvernichtung geredet wird.""](http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/digitaz/artikel/?ressort=bl&amp;dig=2014/11/28/a0141)), der aushalten können muss, dass Studenten den Inhalt seiner Vorlesungen auf obskuren Blogs thematisieren und kritisieren. Dass daraus ein Skandal werden konnte und dass ""die Öffentlichkeit regelmäßig von diesen Vorwürfen erfährt"" ist dabei noch nicht mal der Verdienst der Blogger, sondern der von SPON, FAZ und Co.
 
Auch sonst steht der Artikel auf wackeligen Beinen. Die ""Student(*)innen""-Geschichte konnte ich z.B. nirgendwo verifizieren, die scheint einfach aus der FAZ abgeschrieben worden zu sein - da spielen sich verschiedene Journalisten die Bälle zu, schreiben einen Skandal herbei und irgendwann sind nur noch Schockgeschichten übrig, die niemand mehr überprüfen kann. Wie z.B. die Luhmann-Geschichte. Dass die Kritik an Luhmann darauf basieren soll, dass dieser ""seine Hauptschaffenszeit in den Achtzigerjahren hatte, also in einer Zeit, als die aus der Sicht der Aktivisten teuflische CDU regierte"" klingt einfach viel besser als die - in meinen Augen wahrscheinlichere - Version der Geschichte, nämlich, dass sich die Kritik auf Luhmanns Tätigkeit als CDU-Berater und NSDAP-Mitlied bezog (ob diese Argumentationslinie sinnvoll ist, darf natürlich bezweifelt werden).

Reichlich tendenziös und klischeehaft sind die Darstellungen der Baberowski-Gegner, die abwechselnd als zu alt und abgebrüht und als zu jung und unsicher hingestellt werden und deren Positionen konsequent durcheinander geworfen werden. Auch sowas bleibt hängen, wie man hier in der Diskussion sehen kann, wo die Sprachkritik einer Gruppe dazu führt, dass sämtliche Kritiker als ""Gendernazis, allesamt"" bezeichnet werden. Dabei ist unklar, was die einzelnen kritisierten Gruppen z.B. mit der (obendrein nicht belegten) Student(*)Innen-Geschichte zu tun haben oder auch mit den Aktivisten, die Vorlesungen gestört haben. Das ist auch den Professoren gegenüber ungerecht, weil sie als ein monolithischer Block wahrgenommen werden.

Der Autor interessiert sich aber nicht für solche Nuancen, er verlässt sich stattdessen darauf, dass sich die Leser so sehr empören, dass sie nicht bemerken, wie dünn sein Artikel an vielen Stellen ist, wie z.B. hier:

&gt;Die Hatz ist zwar intellektuell oft dürftig unterfüttert, aber nicht ohne Folgen.

&gt;Es sind schwere Vorwürfe, die Baberowski gemacht werden - doch wer sich mit ihnen beschäftigt, merkt schnell, dass an vielen nur wenig dran ist (...).

Das sind doch auch einfach nur leere und reichlich arrogante Behauptungen ohne Belege. Wenn das alles so falsch ist, dann kann man schon auch mal schreiben, warum das so ist, anstatt sämtliche Kritik autoritär vom Tisch zu wischen.

Lustig immerhin:

Sono stati chiariti alcuni punti importanti, secondo il ddl:

-non si potrà fumare in luoghi pubblici, rischio sanzione come per chi oggi fuma sigarette in luoghi con divieto di fumo.

-chi autoproduce dovrà segnalare il suo raccolto all'agenzia dei monopoli, perchè avendo 5 piantine si potrà fare molto più raccolto dei 15g consentiti a chiunque.

-il reato di spaccio con relative pene rimane

-Commercializzazione della canapa - si potra' produrre, lavorare e vendere cannabis solo con licenza dell'Agenzia dei Monopoli, con divieto di importazione ed esportazione.

To answer your question, median income dosnt accurately describe rich/poor in the US, because the costs of living from state to state vary wildly. You have to have a high income in New Jersey (as well as New York and a lot of California) because the cost of real estate and the taxes they levy are very high. States like Mississippi and Missouri have much lower taxes, and you can buy a house for well under $100,000 there, meaning their cost of living is a lot lower and most companies pay a lot less to their employees down there.

&gt;**Doing business in Europe's periphery is hampered by slow legal systems**

&gt;THE World Bank released its annual ""Doing Business"" [report](http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2015) on October 29th, ranking the world's 189 countries by how attractive they are to companies. That tiny Singapore led the list again this year and Eritrea was stuck in last place was not particularly surprising. Other performances were less easy to explain. Ukraine—which since February has been embroiled in a conflict with neighbouring Russia—leapt up the rankings, partly because some of the data capturing improved administrative practices was collected before hostilities flared.

&gt;Yet the report's most interesting data—on the time it takes to settle a dispute, or wind up a company—sheds light on the lacklustre business investment in Europe's periphery since the financial crisis. Countries where it is quick and easy to enforce contracts or wrap up failing firms are usually more attractive to investors than places with lethargic legal systems. In Greece and Slovenia, hit hard by the financial crisis, it takes much longer to do these things than countries such as France and Germany, whose economies have generally performed better. The situation has got much worse over the last few years. It now takes over two months longer to enforce a contract through the Slovenian court system than it did a year ago. And to do that in Greece now takes more than four years, up around 18 months from 2010. The only bright spot is that there may be a lot more business for Greek lawyers in the near future.",null,0,null,1436963336,null,0,false,0,ct4294w,null,t3_3ddcnm,null,t1_ct4294w,null,t3_3ddcnm,null,null,null,1437869079,null,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13,null

True, but the Spanish general elections are in December and Portuguese elections in October. As the parties forming governments in both Spain and Portugal fear on loosing power to leftist parties in the next elections, the only way for Syriza/Tsipras to make them fear on loosing voters would have been to propose something that the ruling parties would have needed to agree anyway.

If I would have been Tsipras, I would have continued in the second bailout program, received the final financing from the ESM so that I could have kept Greece functioning until elections in Portugal and Spain would have brought my leftist allies on power. In the mean time I would have concentrated on smaller efforts that would have increased my credibility and political capital, like for example getting an European Investment Fund put together and in operation. That way leftist and populist parties would have also been seen as credible alternative, thus providing voting victory first in Portugal and then the Spanish elections could have been won with the natural inertia - everybody wants to be in the winning side. After that both Hollande and Renzi would have had to ally with me not to generate rebellion on their own parties.

Most likely they'll never get quite back to where they could have been ex-crisis, for the skills lost, the discouraged workers, the decayed infrastructure, and the emigration. But we'll see I guess.

There *was* a global depression. [The UK](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/united-kingdom-gdp-per-capita-ppp.png?s=gbrnygdppcapppcd&amp;d1=20030101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=line) is in the same boat as regards not yet being back where it was in 2008, Switzerland is just about back where it was, Denmark is substantially below, Norway is substantially below.

&gt;The EZ has been in a suppressed state for nearly as many years as it was out of it now. EZ members compare badly to any country with its own free floating currency and all debt denominated in its own currency that you care to name. It's beyond ""no downturns"" and into ""40%+ downturn"".

I don't think that's the case at all - I think you'd need to carefully cherry-pick which countries you decided to compare the EZ countries to in order to get that to work. No offence intended, but I suspect that you haven't actually done a broad comparison.

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/

In addition, the EZ contains some countries which have always been sluggish growers. Neither France nor Italy (2 out of the EZ big 3) have posted stellar growth rates for a generation. Ireland, on the other hand, is currently growing at 4.1%. Most of Europe has always come out of recession slowly, because European economies are more rigid as a result of a lot of social stabilisers. It's always possible to compare them disadvantageously to economies with a far more limited set of such stabilisers on the basis of pure growth rates, while ignoring the question of the depth of personal misery that a recession causes - in Europe, that's very much lower because of the stabilisers, but the stabilisers also make recovery slower.

That slower post-recession growth has been a feature of continental economies for at least 40 years. Ascribing it to the effects of the euro seems to me to be just the latest label being tacked on it.

&gt;Or are you saying it was not meant to be an improvement economically over individual currencies, only a ""political"" improvement? If only the latter, how's that working out? Are nations more united now, or are they being driven further apart? Because I personally feel the latter which'd make the EZ a failure on both grounds.

Heh. I think they're pretty united, actually - just Greece isn't. But sure, any major joint project involving money is going to breed stresses the moment it becomes difficult. The question is whether the member states have decided to try to approach the stresses and the difficulties separately and without reference to each other, or through the EU. They've done the latter (the UK, admittedly, not so much) rather than the former - indeed, they've created new European structures.

Economically, though, the euro certainly wasn't supposed to be something that eliminated recessions, although it kind of gets conflated with the prevailing belief of the last couple of decades that the business cycle had been eliminated, and risks reduced to trivial.

In some senses, I can't help but feel that economic commentators, having bought into the idea that we were living in a financial utopia from about 1990 on, have had to turn very hard towards doom and gloom to make people forget that they completely ignored the massive build-up of potential disaster in the global financial system.

Hier, comme beaucoup, je suis allé voir les feux d'artifice du 14 juillet. Je suis arrivé bien en avance, donc du coup j'ai eu le temps d'observer les passants, et surtout ceux de mon âge.  
Mon Dieu, ou ils sont tous en couple, ou les nanas célibataires même pas forcément hyper attirantes ont toutes refusé de reconnaître Philippe d'Espagne comme roi d'Angleterre ( en 1555 ). Ce qui me faisait le plus mal, c'est que je sais qu'à l'inverse je passe probablement ou complètement inaperçu *auprès de la gent féminine*, ou visible mais négativement.  

En effet, je n'assume pas du tout mon apparence physique, et vu que je vais bientôt rentrer dans le monde du travail et que je viens de réaliser qu'à bientôt 25 ans, je n'ai pas eu de jeunesse ( voyages, *aventures*, autres trucs mémorables qui arrivent quand on a confiance en soi et qu'on attire les autres ), il est temps que je change.  
Mon poids surtout, mais aussi mon manque de moyens : pour des fringues potables ( je vous mets au défi de trouver un truc portable qui a de la gueule quand on dépasse les 120 kilos ), un coiffeur ( bien ) plus régulier, de la bonne nourriture saine, et d'autres soins plus occasionnels.  

Du coup j'ai refait attention à ce que je mange depuis mai ( meilleure qualité, plus équilibré, portions réduites ), j'ai accompli mon 1er jour de C25k hier, et dès que je touche mon 1er salaire -j'espère en septembre-, je me paie un abo à une salle de sports avec haltères pour enfin, j'espère, obtenir une apparence que la société et moi jugeons plus qu'acceptable.

Ça, plus le fait que demain je vais faire effectuer une prise de sang, mon docteur s'inquiète de savoir si j'ai un diabète.  
J'aurai vraiment le sentiment d'avoir détruit moi-même ma jeunesse si à l'aube de mon 25ème anniversaire je n'ai pas fait l'effort de changer ma situation. Si même au pied du mur je n'arrive pas à aller de l'avant, plus rien ne le pourra, et je crois que je me tirerai une balle.

Why should a greek referendum be binding on the german government and it's decisions in any way? I just don't understand that. I mean, if Germans would democratically vote that Greece had to implement even harsher austerity, I doubt you would feel bound by that ""because it is the german peoples democratic will"".

Now, to your question. I fear I am going to answer it with some question of my own. Can the EU afford to disregard the question of it's own strength and even survival? Can it support it's weaker member states if it lacks support from the stronger states? Will its solidarity matter on iota if the Union becomes riddled by conflict, weak, and defunct?

Do good intentions and moral bravado always lead to a happy end? 

...

For what it's worth: I *do* want the EU to show greater solidarity towards Greece. But I got the impression that many idealists think that helping Greece is so imperative that it should be done without questions allowed, without regard for the very real political consequences and public misgivings in the creditor countries. I believe that wholesale dismissal of creditor concerns would not be democratic either.

One further question: How should the bailout deal have looked in your opinion?

If I had a say it would have looked very much like the deal you got, with the exception of the fire sale of greek public assets. That I would have liked on a much smaller scale and with the goal of funding an investment program. Also I would have wanted to see stronger cuts in military spending as opposed to VAT hikes. And pressure to cut down on the privileges of the church.

If Greece did all that, I would like to see major debt relief (at least a 30 year grace period, but preferably far lesser interest rates also), bank refinancing and a pan-european investment program after a year or two.",null,0,null,1436964225,null,0,false,0,ct42lk3,null,t3_3dax6x,null,t1_ct42lk3,null,t1_ct4223k,null,null,null,1437869159,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

null,false,andreask,SWED,Sweden,null,"&gt; Let's just say: if Germany forced the closure of schools in Greece, everyone would be in arms

But schools *have* been closing in Greece as well. Your quote doesn't say that the Puerto Rican schools were forced to close, but that it's an effect of budget cuts and mass emigration. These effects are at work in Greece too. Education budgets have received heavy cuts, and just like Puerto Rico, the last five years has seen a lowering of the population by about 2.5%.

It's hard to find current numbers on closed schools, but this is what learnnow.org reported after the first round of austerity in 2011, in their *[What Happens Now? The Fallout of Greece’s Education Cuts](http://learnnow.org/departments/global-learning/the-state-of-public-education-in-greece-2)*:

&gt; Adrienne is a fifth-grade student in Greece. Her neighborhood school closed, so she now travels half an hour to attend school many kilometers away. She sits in a classroom with other students who traveled similar distances. [...]

&gt; At the close of the 2010-11 school year, more than 20,000 public school teachers retired or changed careers due to low wages and difficult working conditions—circumstances as bad as no wintertime heat. And despite this massive exodus of the workforce, the Education Ministry had funds to hire only about 3,500 new teachers, leaving more than 15,000 classrooms without teachers. [...]

&gt; How did the Education Ministry address these enormous challenges? They closed more than 1,000 schools—and combined nearly 2,000 of them—despite widespread resistance from students, parents, teachers and local officials.

In Huffington Post's *[What Do the Greek Austerity Measures Mean for Education?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sarah-butrymowicz/what-do-the-greek-austeri_b_1291810.html)* from 2012, Panos Tsakloglou, an economics professor from Athens university, comments on the extent of the cuts at that point:

&gt; The country's education budget has been falling for years, being cut by nearly 8 percent between 2010 and 2011 alone and an additional 2.9 percent between 2011 and 2012. Considering all of the factors, such as inflation, Tsakloglou estimated that ""in real terms"" the decline in education funding has been about 20 to 25 percent.

More on the effect of these cuts, and the situation for teachers, are touched upon in a passage from Alexandra Pascalidou's 2013 book *Kaos*. Here's my wonky translation from Swedish:

&gt; My 30 year old teacher friend Evi, who moved back to her parents after a pay cut, says that it would be pathetic to complain that she'll probably never be able to get married and have kids, when the school she teaches at can't even afford chalk for the class room. The attractive math teacher flirts in vain with her. ""To fall for a colleague isn't on the map. Two teacher salaries isn't enough to raise a family. The only thing that can save me is a rich man"", she says.",null,0,null,1436964256,null,0,false,0,ct42lzt,null,t3_3dbldl,null,t1_ct42lzt,null,t1_ct3xec2,null,null,null,1437869159,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

&gt;According to the Supreme Court of Cassation, Prosecutor Rumen Penev will go to prison for three years, as he had requested a bribe of 25 thousand, reports ""Legal World"". He was detained by police more than three and a half years ago.

&gt;In October 2011. The prosecutor suggested to the lawyer Nayden Nikolov that he would not prosecute and would terminate his investigation against him in the case of a financial dispute with a customer by exerting influence over another prosecutor - Janko Zheliazkov. Penev's condition was that Nikolov pay 25 thousand to him. Subsequently Rumen Penev reduced the price to 21 thousand. Lawyer Nikolov however flagged in the police, after which the prosecutor was arrested with marked money in the city center.

&gt;The case against Nikolov started at Sofia City Court, which found him guilty in the fall of 2012. and imposed a 3.5 years effective sentence. Subsequently Appeal Court (SAS) mitigate punishment in a suspended sentence, and the Supreme Court returned the case for retrial. This time the SAS found new mitigating circumstances - a relatively young age of the prosecutor (39 years), his clean criminal record and good characterter references and marital status.

&gt;The Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of Cassation, which considered the case, was required to decide the case. Ultimately, according to the court his age at 39 years old is not a reason which explains the lack of life and professional experience which are needed to resist the temptation of bribery.

In other words we're talking about a set of agreed upon principles of polity; the common rights we establish, the common protections we afford. 

--

Some legislation needs to be crafted at the EU level -- why? Sometimes the scope of any one task is too large for individual states. Perhaps the issue is an imminent crisis, or climate change. The uncoordinated enactment of state-specific regulatory measures in addressing climate change is ineffectual, highly inefficient, and wasteful.  European institutions are better suited to oversee the implementation of standards EU-wide. Minimizing regulatory capture as the regulation is uniform. 

----

--

Sure, you're slightly curtailed in possible choices. But you get to sculpt what those rights and principles are. In return you're given a far freer, more dynamic, more prosperous, and more global Europe. In creating a political union there are a few axioms in creating a truly common, fair, and open market. Among these requisites are: transfer payment dislocated from debt management; collective debt; completing the banking union; establish a dual mandate (inflation *&amp;* unemployment), reforming the ECB;  and establish a European deposit guarantee scheme.

I don't think that's the promise DC got, although that may well have been the way he represented it. What was actually decided was that the EFSM would not be used for measures to support the stability of the euro area as a whole. The Council decision was:

&gt;""This mechanism [the ESM] will replace the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), which will remain in force until June 2013. **As this mechanism is designed to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole, the European Council agreed that Article 122(2) TFEU will no longer be needed for such purposes.** Heads of State or Government therefore agreed that it should not be used for such purposes."" (emphasis added).

The Commission's legal opinion was:

&gt;""Nor does the draft decision [to change Article 136 TFEU] reduce the competences conferred on the Union. **In particular, it does not affect either the specific solidarity mechanisms provided for in Articles 122 and 143 of the TFEU in the event that a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties** or the Union's competences in terms of coordination and surveillance of the economic and financial policies of the Member States in general and of Member States whose currency is the euro in particular.""

High interest rates are a sign of low confidence. They show that the creditors do not expect Greece to be able to solve the deficit problem and become profitable/solvent again. If others think the loans won't be paid back, shouldn't you become skeptical as well? And this is indirectly tied to
&gt;You, as a parent, refused her that ( = ECB doesn't bail out states) but gave her a sermon,

The parent has not one but many children. It should treat all children equal, it is not justifiable to bail out one, and especially the one with the lowest confidence ratings to pay back, without the others.

Denmark does not have its own free floating currency, its krone is a proxy for Euros.

The UK and Switzerland for reasons known only to them decided to pursue austerity despite issuing the same currency they were borrowing. Any government can kill its own economy through bad policy, the point is that if you have your own currency it'll be of your volition - it won't/can't be forced upon you by outside creditors.

Norway surprises me - their unemployment is low, they are at an all-time high of GDP, and apparently they're still concerned about over heating their economy (or were in 2013), but their absolute GDP figure is not much above 2008. I don't know enough about the country other than it'd have been hit hard by the decline in oil prices to comment, especially for data that's been adjusted for (I expect) a decline in their exchange rate due to decreased demand for exports (I haven't checked fx data, but I assume this to be the case).

&gt; Ireland, on the other hand, is currently growing at 4.1%.

It's hard to be impressed when Ireland's been held back for the better part of the decade. Yes, they're finally *recovering* well now, after 7 years, but growing? Kind of implies new heights doesn't it? Also what's the point - Italy's gone outright *backwards*. That's not just ""non-stellar growth"" - it's literally the opposite of growth. I'm quite unsure where you're trying to go with this.

&gt;I think you'd need to carefully cherry-pick which countries you decided to compare the EZ countries to in order to get that to work

How about this. The only countries that have run into debt crises, run into problems with their creditors, are those that have chosen to borrow currencies they do not issue. I admit, much of the world has stifled growth through bad policy (esp with the right wing feeling vindicated by what's going on in Europe, forming government in many countries - UK/Aus/Canada), but the important thing is that it was only forced upon countries that are in the EZ or otherwise borrow external currencies.

With united EU whole countries would be like that.

Before the Euro was implemented, public opinion in Germany was against it. Now it is strongly in favour. When asked if there should be federalisation of the EU only a plurality is in favour. But when unifiying political measures are brought up in the polls, there is a dependable majority in favour of almost every single policy that would lead to federalisation.

That is not to say that one should ignore public sentiment, only that public sentiment can change, and that elected leaders ought to be at the frontline to implement farsighted policies and convince the people of the merits of those policies.

It is always difficult to say what *""the people""* want to happen. And I am always wary of those that lay claim to speaking *""for the people""*, as if there was a unified and unchanging voice of the people, and not a multitude of conflicting opinions in constant flux.

But ... as far as I read the public mood, Europeans don't seem to be terribly against federalisation, provided it is implemented at a steady pace and with a regard for national sentiment and traditions.
And for me that is good enough to implement those policies, when you are a politician with the mandate to govern.

nothing to do with looks my friend but integration, any by that I mean real integration. it's easier to integrate 2% foreign population than 10% as when it reaches those levels they just gang together instead of putting in the work to adopt Finnish virtues and what you have then is Sweden.

Due to the stupidity of taking in so many Somalis it's already happening that they are grouping together, give Finns well educated immigrants who pass certain language proficiency levels before getting a visa and you will find these type of people would be welcomed with open arms and they are willing but just cant get visa's. 

I'm not daft enough to think there is nothing we can improve about our own country from foreigners but lets be honest the refugees are  a joke, most are uneducated and we have enough uneducated Finns looking to fill basic positions as it is, They find it tough to get a job because of lack of skills and the obvious racism and very soon resign themselves to a life on the welfare state and maybe pop out a few kids that they will likely raise to the same standard.

&gt; **Role of Germany**  
Germany is the key trading partner of Iran. Iran's nuclear program depends mainly upon German products and services. For example, the thousands of centrifuges used to enrich the uranium are controlled by Siemens ""Simatic WinCC Step7"" software. Around 50 German firms have their own branch offices in Iran, and more than 12,000 firms have their own trade representatives in Iran. Many well-known German companies are involved in major Iranian infrastructure projects, especially in the petrochemical sector, like Linde, BASF, Lurgi, Krupp, Siemens, ZF Friedrichshafen, Mercedes, Volkswagen and MAN (2008).

&gt; In 2005, Germany had the largest share of Iran's export market with $5.67 billion (14.4%). In 2008, German exports to Iran increased by 8.9 percent and comprised 84.7 percent of the total German–Iranian trade volume. The overall bilateral trade volume until the end of September 2008 stood at 3.23 billion euros, compared to 2.98 billion euros the previous year. The value of trade between Tehran and Berlin increased from around 4.3 billion euro in 2009 to nearly 4.7 billion euro in 2010.

&gt; The Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce has estimated that economic sanctions against Iran may cost more than 10,000 German jobs and have a negative impact on the economic growth of Germany. Sanctions would especially hurt medium-sized German companies, which depend heavily on trade with Iran.

I'm not sure where you got that, but that's not what that measures. Here is their definition of corruption.

*""[Corruption is defined] as “the abuse of entrusted power for private gain”. Corruption can be classified as grand, petty and political, depending on the amounts of money lost and the sector where it occurs.
Grand corruption consists of acts committed at a high level of government that distort policies or the central functioning of the state, enabling leaders to benefit at the expense of the public good. Petty corruption refers to everyday abuse of entrusted power by low- and mid-level public officials in their interactions with ordinary citizens, who often are trying to access basic goods or services in places like hospitals, schools, police departments and other agencies.
Political corruption is a manipulation of policies, institutions and rules of procedure in the allocation of resources and financing by political decision makers, who abuse their position to sustain their power, status and wealth.*""

And that makes sense, given that there are increasing numbers of devices hooked to the internet in any one household. Literally all the Tories have done is move parental controls further upstream.

null,false,manueslapera,null,null,null,"Things that i can't recommend enough:

- Go to Plaza de la Catedral and hang out there. The vibe is very relaxing and you get to see all kinds of people walking around.If you want to eat something sweet, in the plaza there is a chocolate place called valor. Also, in a small street next to the plaza (going to Traperia Street ) they serve organic ice pops that are incredible.

- Go to mercado de veronicas. Its one of the markets of the city, i love to walk around and see the fresh produce, fresh seafood (delicious), people talking... Coolest thing is you can buy anything you want there, and there are a couple of tiny bars inside the market that will cook it for free.

- Plaza de San Juan has the best restaurants in town, I recommend La Pequeña (traditional Murcian food).

- Visit the cathedral of course! One of the few churrigueresco-style cathedrals in Spain. They do guided tours where you go all the way up to the tower near the bells.

- If you have time, I would go to Santuario de la Fuensanta, its a beautiful church up in the mountains near the city (you can see it from the city), with nice views. 

Like they mentioned above, it's going to be very hot in August, and a lot of people will be in their beach house, so night places (bars and pubs) will probably be kinda of dead. Best choice would be going to Las Tascas near Plaza de la Merced (small bars with a college-vibe)

Regarding food, everything is extremely good. Murcia is called ""The gardens of Europe"" since we produce a ridiculous amount of fresh produce. Since we are so close to the Mediterranean, we also have fresh seafood/fish. A personal favorite is the ""Marinera"", which is basically potato salad on a cracker, but somehow tastes like heaven.",null,0,null,1436966872,null,0,false,0,ct43slh,null,t3_3d9vph,null,t1_ct43slh,null,t1_ct3yym2,null,null,null,1437869681,null,1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,1,null

* We don't have single-payer health insurance. There's what boils down to a two class system of those publicly insured and those privately insured with those privately insured getting better service than those publicly insured.

* While technically illegal private insurances refuse people constantly. They can do this because the costs of a trial have to be initially covered by the person suing the insurance.

* Even some necessary medical procedures are not covered in full. Need new glasses? Here are 30€, fuck off then.

* If you are a freelancer or a business owner you won't get public insurance, only private and god help you paying for that. You have to own the company and then hire yourself so you can pay the rate of both you (employee) and the other you (employer).

* We have a special ""cast"" of officials called Beamte, who while getting paid more, more vacation days, health insurance and pensions and being essentially unfireable give up the right to strike.

null,false,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,null,"&gt;Denmark does not have its own free floating currency, its krone is a proxy for Euros.
&gt;The UK and Switzerland for reasons known only to them decided to pursue austerity despite issuing the same currency they were borrowing. Any government can kill its own economy through bad policy, the point is that if you have your own currency it'll be of your volition - it won't/can't be forced upon you by outside creditors.
&gt;Norway surprises me - their unemployment is low, they are at an all-time high of GDP, and apparently they're still concerned about over heating their economy (or were in 2013), but their absolute GDP figure is not much above 2008. I don't know enough about the country other than it'd have been hit hard by the decline in oil prices to comment, especially for data that's been adjusted for (I expect) a decline in their exchange rate due to decreased demand for exports (I haven't checked fx data, but I assume this to be the case).

And this is pretty much what I meant when I said we'd have to get into cherry-picking to support your original claim. You're now coming up with a variety of special individual explanations for each counter-example. You're not certain that those explanations are in line with the facts, but you do seem pretty certain that your original thesis holds, despite requiring lots of new special arguments.

&gt;How about this. The only countries that have run into debt crises, run into problems with their creditors, are those that have chosen to borrow currencies they do not issue. I admit, much of the world has stifled growth through bad policy (esp with the right wing feeling vindicated by what's going on in Europe, forming government in many countries - UK/Aus/Canada), but the important thing is that it was only forced upon countries that are in the EZ or otherwise borrow external currencies.

Well, #1, Iceland. More generally, a lot of countries effectively can't borrow in their domestic currency - nothing to do with the euro, people just regard their currency as dodgy. Lenders outside Greece wouldn't be lending to Greece in drachma if Greece were outside the EZ, because the drachma is too unstable - well, sorry, more accurately they would only lend in drachma at a massive premium.

So this looks like more special explanations are required.",null,0,null,1436967110,null,0,false,0,ct43wpn,null,t3_3dcnoe,null,t1_ct43wpn,null,t1_ct4323v,null,null,null,1437869736,null,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4,null

Distributing them according to GDP is good start but then you have to remember that cost of immigrants are different on different nations like the heating example that I used. I would support that kind of decision but it should have limit on how many % of GDP each nation should spent on immigrants and if the number is over the required amount then that nation should not accept anymore of them. And if some nation reaches that number there should be new talks about the deal and maybe new deal.

Also there is problem with nations that are seriously mixed like Estonia there Estonians only make abou 55-60% of the population while russian are close second. How many immigrants would you send to the nation that is that much mixed all ready without making population spread even more unstable. As there is ""some"" tension between the russian and estonian speaking populations because of Ukraine and Georgia stuff

&gt;Is your country willing to pay the bill?

I think that if whole EU or/and EZ agrees to pay the bill then Finland would also support it as 5,5m nation cant pay that kind of bill alone as we are currently receiving warnings from EU to do something to our joblessness problem. We might be 2nd crisis state in northern- EU (Iceland was first)

&gt;Sending them back is a crime against humanity.

Yep, but do you seriously think that EU can handle all of the immigrants and illegals that come here without neo-nazi etc. parties rising to power? 

I think Golden Dawn is good example about what happens when there are too many immigrants coming over to certain nation. I would want to help all those people but with current political landscape it is impossible if we dont want nationalist and anti-immigrant parties to have power. Our anti-immigration anti-EU party is now 2nd largest in here is expected to grow in future even thought we havent even got that many immigrants or refugees.

&gt;Maybe then you'll learn not to shit on those who keep your borders safe so you can maintain your standards of living.

""shit on"" is wrong word I mainly expect that those ""who keep borders safe"" do their job. We are on the border of Russia and our border guard does its best(currently it is understaffed because of austerity that our nation has done) and we dont whine about being on the border.

IF lets say Greece wants peoples sympathies because of the immigrant problem they should ask for help not just whine about it. If Germany and France etc. send troops or polices to southern Greece and Balkans to keep the immigrant crisis in control I think that Greeks would just scream ""It is a COUP, They have come to take over our country!!"" especially after this new ""deal"" that lot of ""rich""nations dislike a lot.

&gt;lose another 10-15% due to the austerity you imposed

So your governments didnt F* up and all of it is because of other EZ nations? Nice thinking there, I would love to accuse my bank of making me bankrupt even thought I was the one who used all of that money and now cant pay even the interest on those loans.

&gt;Thank you for your solidarity

Solidarity is word used when shitty.. I mean weak party want something from stronger one or when strong one want to look good/cool in eyes of other people.

EZ is more like a family and if little brother F* up other family members will make sure that he will remember it for LOOONG time especially if that little brother uses threats to have what he wants(I will break things if I dont get what I want -stuff) that nazi-debt stuff was something from bottom of the barrel.",null,0,null,1436967391,null,0,1436967701,0,ct441ir,null,t3_3d4uan,null,t1_ct441ir,null,t1_ct42dus,null,null,null,1437869843,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Also mir wurde in der Schule noch beigebracht, dass Alkohol eine schädliche Droge ist und welche schweren Folgen insbesondere der Missbrauch haben kann.


Dann gibts noch regelmäßig Werbespots, die auf die Gefahren von Alkohol hinweisen (Kenn dein Limit, usw.)


Dann gibts natürlich noch Eltern, aber denen kann man ja nicht zutrauen ihre Kinder zu erziehen. 



Unterschied zu Zigaretten ist wohl, dass der Rausch das gefährlichere ist und nicht die Inhaltsstoffe per se (Alkohol ist natürlich auch nicht gut gür die Leber, aber ""Teer in die Lunge"" ist wohl das höhere Gesundheitsrisiko). Daher wird bei Zigaretten bereits vor dem Konsum und bei Alkohol vor dem verantwortungslosen Trinken gewarnt.



Wieso nicht verbieten, wenn andere, ""harmlosere"" Drogen verboten sind?
Viel Glück dabei. Alkohol ist relativ einfach schnell selbstgemacht. Dafür braucht man keine geheimen Gewächshäuser.

null,false,spin0,FINL,Finland,null,"&gt; The Greek PM is trying to get that offer he walked away with passed by parliament, right? 

That is not the third bailout deal. Those are the *prior actions*, mostly stuff that Greece had agreed to in the previous two bailouts but not actually implemented, added with the additional condition to roll back the unilatelar actions Greece did breaking its agreement in February when it promised not to do such things at all. Trust towards Greece is about zero, and when those prior actions are implemented that will make Greece eligible for opening negotiation for a third bailout. 

Only then there will be negotiations for the terms and details of that ESM bailout itself. That will take weeks to months.

&gt; That could fail OR it gets approved but then the IMF won't go along with the bailout.

No, the IMF involment does not depend on this. And certainly the IMF will attend the negotiations for the third bailout after they have been opened. 

So, eventually the IMF involment will depend on the terms of the ESM bailout which will be negotiated in the coming weeks. It is no secret that the IMF has little patience left for Greece and has even been keen on leaving altogether. In diplomatic terms the new Greek government has treated the IMF with open hostility this year, and in January the first thing V-man did was this: [Greece’s finance minister vows to shun officials from troika](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/30/greece-finance-minister-yanis-varoufakis-shun-officials-troika)  
&gt; Yanis Varoufakis says new government will refuse to engage with auditors from the EU, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

Everyone knows Greece will need debt restructuring, especially after the past wasted six months which have only caused damage to the Greek economy. Since 2012 the institutions, including the IMF, have been saying: *reforms first, then we can discuss debt restructuring*. They have acknowledged the need of it years ago. But you won't do any restructuring with a partner that has refused to adhere to its previous commitments while asking for more money. And the line of the institutions is remains the same. 

Therefore it's vital for Greece to finally implement the prior actions.

The big problem here is: *why would anyone borrow money to someone simultaneoulsy asking for both debt relief and new loans?*

I know I wouldn't. And I know I'm not alone in that. Pretty much common sense. And most importantly: *the ECB would not.* Introduce debt relief now and you can say goodbye to ELA for some time. The ECB has their rules.

Which takes us back to one of the last interviews while V-man still was the finance minister where he stated that his plan is based on the institutions breaking their rules for his advantage. He proclaimed that the capital controls could be lifted like next Tuesday because the ECB would break its rules and simply send more money. I don't know where he got that theory but someone should have told him it was wrong from the start.

&gt; In the meantime, aren't Greek cash reserves dangerously low? How long can Greece go without some sort of infusion before the ATMs are basically tapped?

Not for long. Probably matter of days now, not weeks.

So, the high priority issue for the Eurogroup (and ECOFIN) is to look at bridge financing for Greece to carry the country through the summer until the first trench of the possible third bailout is available (**if** it materializes). The absolute minimum Greece will need is €7bn by 20 July and €5bn by mid August but they'll need more on top of that. Unclear how much.

And even getting the bridge financing is not certain. Negotiating and arranging it will probably take some time, and it will likely come with strict conditions attached to it. Expect some tough negotiations for it.

And where would the bridge money come from? That takes us back to the expired second bailout program from the EFSF. Contrary to many redditor's beliefs the creditors did not make huge profits on those loans. No, the profits were actually paid back to Greece and for that there were mechanisms established.

As the second bailout program expired at the end of the June also those mechanisms expired. But they still have some previously accumulated funds which would have been given to Greece if the program had continued as planned. AFAIK there's about €3.3bn in ECB, €1.85bn in ESM, and about €1.5bn by EZ governments. My numbers could be off, but you get the idea.

eleasing those funds to Greece could be a quick process without the need of going through the national parliaments but it needs an unanimous decision by the Eurogroup. **If** such unanimous decision is guarateed, and expect strict conditions attached to it, then there's at least one part of the bridge financing for Greece.

But to take Greece through the summer will likely need more. Bilateral loans from some EZ countries? Passing the hat among the EU countries? I have absolutely no idea. Seems that neither has the Eurogroup nor the ECOFIN.

One thing is certain: the ECB cannot and will not rise the ELA limit until there's certainty of either bridge financing or a deal for the third bailout. Before that the Greek banks will remain closed. And in any event it will take long time (months to years) until Greece can fully lift the capital controls it has imposed.

What I don't get in this saga is why some still hail V-man as a great thinker. I mean, with his game theory he took his country from budding growth to capital controls in mere five months. In the class of rare achievements that is in class of its own. Any random persom from street would have fared better as a finance minister by doing absolutely nothing at all. Hell, even a roll of tape or a paperweight would have fared better.

&gt; So process-wise, where does that leave Greece and the Euro group? 

Next up process-wise:  

1. The prior actions agreed last weekend.  
Greece has to implement those to be eligible for a third bailout. Needs to get accepted by the Greek parliament and other countries too. Will get back at least some of the lost trust on Greece.

2. Bridge financing.  
A tough nut to crack. Will take days to weeks. Still unclear how and where that money would come from. Additionally, trust towards Greece is pretty much zero after the past six months. There will probably be some kind of interim financing for the next couple of weeks until they figure out how to get the financing for the next months before the third bailout materializers (**if** it will).

3. Negotiations for the third bailout from the ESM.  
An even tougher nut to crack. Will take weeks to months. How to include even further debt relief (Greece has already had debt relief several times) while giving more loans? How to facilitate it within the existing mechanisms? And even more importantly how to use those existing mechanisms without introducing further liabilities on the EU citizens? Because people are pretty pissed and won't easily accept further putting their wallets on the line for Greece once more.

4. Important thing to remember.  
First and foremost Greece is our friend and partner. A prosperous Greece is in everyone's interest. I've heard many insane conspiracy theories about how everyone else is out to destroy Greece bacause whatever reasons. But the reality is very simple: everyone in the EZ and in the EU would prefer a prosperous Greece to a ruined one (except perhaps some in the minority of far-right and far-left).

It's really not important: debt is debt, money is money, the only thing that matters is whether it's paid on time. Their debt was stable from 1994 to 2007. It was a problem, but a manageable problem and one that was under control. They were walking too close to the edge than was commendable, true, but it was the banking crisis and the bank bailouts that gave them a push in the wrong direction... and a construction fault of the Eurozone that neglected to install safety rails.

&gt;The parent has not one but many children. It should treat all children equal, it is not justifiable to bail out one, and especially the one with the lowest confidence ratings to pay back, without the others.

Where did I say that others states should not be able to use such emergency measures? Also consider that just the option to use such measures is enough to make the markets behave: when the ECB announced the option of OMT, the interest rates on bonds stopped rising and started decreasing again all over Europe - but the ECB hasn't spent a cent on OMT so far. The threat is enough. These options prevent crisises and prevent costs.

Additionally, why were the banks bailed out without hesitation then?

&gt;This is a false equivalence. Not all financial cuts are bad, cutting pensions is not like refusing antidepressants.

But the ones forced on Greece were, as is proven by the persistent recession caused by them.

Si ce qui te fais plaisir c'est de monter un perso au level 60 sur wow alors oui tu as eu une jeunesse. 

* J'ai été très associal, je reste socialement anxieux (ca se voit pas une fois la glace brisée),  Mais à force d'essayer de faire des activités où il faut rencontrer des gens je m'en tire beaucoup mieux 

* J'ai jamais eu de problème de poid, mais je sais pas si à 120 kg, un from couch to 25k est adapté, je me vois pas courrir avec un sac de 40kg sur le dos, je vois pas comment les genoux vont tenir.  va voir un médecin du sport qui pourra te conseiller quelque chose de moins traumatisant (au hasard je dirais piscine) 

* Par rapport à ce que tu dis sur tes phobies sociales, ne fait surtout pas un sport qui consite à soulever de la fonte tout seul dans un coin de la salle. Fait un truc (individuel ou collectif) qui se fait en groupe. Pas forcément un sport co, du tennis, du judo ou de l'escalade où il te faut un binome c'est pas mal non plus. Le but c'est aussi de discuter avec d'autres gens.  (Et en bonus c'est souvent moins cher qu'un abonnement à une salle de gym) 

* Les assos, les syndicats, les parti politique, les cours de musique/théatre/danse etc... C'est aussi l'occasion de rencontrer des gens, de sortir de chez toi, de découvrir d'autres choses etc...

null,false,chelidonia,null,null,null,"Il ragionamento che fai è un po' alla rovescia... Anzi, a parere di tutti il costo degli ebook dovrebbe essere molto più basso di quello che è adesso.

Ragioniamo sui costi di produzione. (Premetto che di editoria non sono un'esperta ma sono abbastanza informata, se c'è qualche imprecisione sarò felice di correggere)

Libro italiano, quindi niente costo di traduzione, e perfetto, quindi senza costi di correzione/editing. Quando si decide il prezzo di vendita di un ebook, in teoria bisognerebbe prendere in considerazione 1) la percentuale che andrà all'autore (che, per la cronaca, in media va dal 6 al 10%), 2) la percentuale che andrà a chi lo ha impaginato, 3) eventuali costi per i diritti dell'immagine di copertina/diritti vari, 5) la percentuale che andrà al portale on-line (amazon, ecc.) che rivende l'ebook.

Ora, ragioniamo sul prezzo di copertina di un libro cartaceo. Oltre a tutte le spese qui sopra elencate, a parte il punto 5, si aggiungono 5.bis) La percentuale che andrà alla libreria, 6) le spese di stampa, 7) le spese di magazzino, 3) le spese di distribuzione. Ora, è ovvio che costi di meno un ebook se il processo viene ""interrotto"" a quando il file è bello pronto ad andare in stampa ma non va in stampa e invece viene rivenduto così com'è.

Poi ovviamente ci sono i costi di marketing, e questo è un altro discorso. Sono il prezzo che la casa editrice paga affinché i libri selezionati da lei siano pubblicizzati, recensiti, messi in prima fila in libreria... Questo funziona bene con le librerie fisiche, poiché il target delle librerie fisiche (e dell'editoria in generale) non sono i lettori forti, ma i lettori casuali, quelli che comprano tre libri all'anno e tutti sotto natale per fare dei regali. Dato che ancora non c'è la cultura del ""gli ebook sono libri tanto quanto quelli cartacei"", un libro per avere successo deve necessariamente non solo arrivare in libreria, ma anche essere esposto in bella vista nei primi due metri di negozio. Altrimenti il consumatore si perderà e il libro non sarà mai aperto.

E questo ci porta al tuo secondo punto: qual è il futuro delle librerie? Non roseo, al momento.

Non credo che le librerie esisteranno come le abbiamo conosciute fin'ora; con la diffusione degli e-reader e degli ebook, le librerie fisiche saranno solo una vetrina per dei libri che spesso e volentieri saranno comprati online/piratati. Le librerie che non chiuderanno probabilmente si specializzeranno, rivendendo non libri di consumo ma testi specialistici.

Per la cronaca, il motivo per cui il mercato degli ebook ancora non decolla e le persone ancora piratano i libri è dovuto al fatto che gli ebook vengono venduti con tremila protezioni che non permettono una gestione libera del file...

The basic principle however is quite straightforward, if you have a monetary union in which there is a centralised authority to issue money then there needs to be some control for each member on how it spends its income (or more realistically - how it manages its economy).

A country in a monetary union cannot logically continue to issue debt without some consideration for the other members otherwise a member could keep issuing debt with no constraint and thus burden the other members with the debt (or cause itself to become bankrupt and hence exit the union). 

There are a few historical examples of the above but for the life of me I can't remember which ones.

Personally I think it's grotesque. Once you actually lose your virginity and realise that porn is in no way indicative of what partnered sex is actually like then I think at that point porn becomes destructive. As you get more and more fixed on porn, the more it influences your own sex life, and porn in almost every way degrades women. I also think that the nature of porn is novel. Searching for 'new stuff' leads to the young plastic mind linking sex with novelty and that can cause serious relationship issues in the future when a person 'gets bored' of the same 6 sexual positions in two peoples' partnered sex life, and leads to unnecessary heartache and breakup which could be completely avoided. That's not just my hair-brained idea; it is backed up by PhD wielding psychologists who study sex in an academic context. I don't think porn is 'wrong', but I think it's unhealthy. And I take issue with society's insistence that I am lying to myself because I don't use it.

I honestly don't feel intimidated by the slippery slope side of things. I think it honestly poses no credible threat. If a political party had their site blocked it would be an outrage and the backlash would have it unblocked in a day. If they blocked Islamic extremist content, given the number of young Britons going to Syria, would that kind of censorship be such a bad thing?

&gt;I'm pro givig ""concerned parents™"" the ability to block everything that isn't bible.com or what have you, I don't have a say in how people raise their children and I shouldn't, it's not my business.

But is this not wilfully withholding information from a child in the free market of ideas, i.e. a form of censorship? Why should a child be able to access hardcore porn in the name of free speech, but not be told about the world it occupies in the name of understanding the world it lives in? Those things seem diametrically opposed- at least to me.

It's also not a hassle to uncheck a box. It's literally a case of forcing people to look at a dialogue box about parental controls when they set up a new internet connection. That's all it is.

""Has own free-floating currency and all debt denominated in that currency"" is always what I ask for. I didn't clarify it in this specific comment thread, but I'm very consistent with it.

Now you'd have to be very naive to think that'd mean ""will always perform well under all circumstances"", but it's certainly the starting point that all countries ought want to operate from.

And clearly, regardless of what currency you use, any gov't can destroy its own economy by net taxing so highly that people are out of the job, or vice versa - spending until inflation's through the roof. You have to at least give me that.

Now anyway just because you have found two countries with their own free floating currencies that have not done greatly (Switzerland/UK) does not mean that monetary unions absent fiscal unions are fine.

Curious though, I decided to tally them.

**Countries with their own floating fiat that are doing well on multiple measures vs EZ** (13):

Australia
Canada
Albania
Brazil
Hungary
Indonesia
Japan
South Korea
New Zealand
Peru
Poland
Turkey
USA

**Those that are debatable** (3):

Norway (4.2% unemployment, record GDP, all despite collapse in oil prices)
Iceland (4.1% unemployment, well and truly on long-term trend)
Sweden (looks OK long-term [to me](http://i.imgur.com/mbQDRAk.png), but last couple of years not stellar, unemployment is high at 8%)

**Those that are on par** (2) - if we're being **very** generous to the EZ:

UK (5.6% unemployment rate), Switzerland (3.1% unemployment)

**Those that are doing worse**:

&lt;cough&gt;

There really aren't many more countries with their own floating currencies to name. I think I've got all the big ones, feel free to add any I've missed to the appropriate column.

**For reference:**
Average EZ unemployment is 11.1%, GDP/capita still substantially below [2008](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/gdp-per-capita).

&gt; Well, #1, Iceland.

Iceland allowed its financial sector to run amok amassing huge (ridiculously so) amounts of **foreign-denominated debt**. If there's to be any kind of bailout, moving of that debt from private sector balance sheets to public sector, it'd have to be in the same denomination currency as it's owed - hence why Iceland went to the IMF. It wasn't krona they needed, it was USD for their banks.

&gt; More generally, a lot of countries effectively can't borrow in their domestic currency

Heh. You mean to tell me there's currencies out there that householders can borrow, but the governments issuing them can't? What are they trying to do, lock in rates 30 years at a time or something? If so, don't pay the premium to lock in rates. Just borrow on a shorter term. Clearly, if there's *any* lending of the currency occurring, the issuer can borrow it too.

&gt; You're not certain that those explanations are in line with the facts

I've seeked more data and it seems to have backed my position well that nations with their own free floating currencies (and preferably debt denominated in those currencies - Iceland is a notable exception thanks to the banks) are doing better than nations confined to the euro. That the crisis seems to be *very* Euro-centric, which backs my hypothesis that borrowing something you do not issue is a recipe for disaster, and that the ensuing austerity may well leave your economy drastically underemployed with growth suffering in turn.",null,0,null,1436969276,null,0,1436970487,0,ct450rb,null,t3_3dcnoe,null,t1_ct450rb,null,t1_ct43wpn,null,null,null,1437870535,null,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1,null

I know, there is a lot of subjective negativity in this thread. We are rather direct when we have our doubts. If you look at other threads, there are many questions regarding 3 core topics: getting citizenship, travelling somewhere and working/studying here. We respond kinda direct, I know. And I am sorry for that. But we usually tell the bad stuff and warn people. You seemed to euphoric and that seemed like you had a too utopic view of how Germany is. I could tell you how awesome I think it is to not worry about illnesses, be free to go to any doctor I want without thinking about any costs. How I love my 30 vacation days and the fact that in theory I have only 220 work days a year. I feel save because guns are seldomly used anywhere and I love to ride a car and not feel bad about driving fast in the areas. I can even tell you that I love how our public transportation works and that I don't mind that they strike from time to time.

In small firms where you have so much responsibility it is even more important that you are learning German as you have to explain things to non-ITpeople. But you already said that you would do that. The smaller the company the more you will face people not comfortable in English.


I just wanted to make it clear to you that the statement to make the equivalent of 70k€ may not be possible in Germany. Maybe if you factor in public health and other things that are not payed directly. Fact is, [the average IT income in Germany is not that high compared to your figures](http://www.absolventa.de/jobs/channel/it/thema/gehalt-informatiker):

Berufserfahrung zahlt sich aus. Webdesigner und Mitarbeiter im Anwendersupport steigern ihr Gehalt nach 10 Jahren im Job im Schnitt auf etwa 47.000 Euro. System- und Netzwerkadministratoren beziehen dann sogar ein Informatiker-Gehalt von 58.000 Euro. Noch besser schneiden Softwareentwickler (65.000 Euro), IT-Berater (73.000 Euro) und SAP-Berater (76.000 Euro) ab.

This says that after 10 years, people in webdesign and support will make an average of 47,000; System- and network administrators will make 58k. Developer 65k, consultants 73k and consultants for SAP software 76k.

Maybe you are right and you work very well and you have a lot of responsibility and attack the odds. I really hope you do.

I don't know anything about visa or immigration or citizenship. I am someone in IT that just wanted to say that you should be aware of the salary gap between Germany and the US. I included the information about our health system and how it is mandatory but you can choose to use a private insurer.

Politische Relevanz ist dort wiederum so definiert, dass das Onlineangebot (in diesem Fall Reddit) Themen behandeln sollte, deren Inhalte möglichst frei zugänglich sind, eine umfassende Zielgruppe betreffen, partizipative Elemente beinhalten, etc. Da gibts ne schöne, lange Liste von Kriterien. Außerdem sollte es natürlich auch eine gewisse Eigenproduktion von Inhalten geben und nicht nur ""wiederkäuen"". Politisch steht in diesem Falle vage für ""zielgerichtetes Handeln"". 

Meine Frage ist also übergeordnet in etwa: ""Gibt es auf Reddit genügend (ernst gemeintes) Engagement im Social News/Citizen Journalism-Bereich, um als politisch relevantes Medium ernst genommen zu werden?"". Und die Umfrage dient u.a. dazu, herauszufinden, ob die bereits aktiven User Reddit überhaupt Potenzial für so einen Status zusprechen.

In economical terms this might actually make sense, everything else is just burnt to ashes. Different countries, address different issues. Each country faces several different social problems, therefore applies several different social policies. Rinse and repeat for Law &amp; Order, Transports, Public Services, Welfare, Taxes, Foreign Affairs, Subsidies, Education, Health, on and on.

Should this happen it wouldn't still mean that it would work economically speaking. Fiscal union would mean that any country with a huge load of debt would drag down everybody with it. It would intertwine all EU countries even more.

 
&gt; it will mean unprecedented levels of supranational cooperation between those countries, 

Yes it will, by killing the economy of countries like Ireland who would have to adhere to the ""against fiscal dumping"" crusade led by France.

Or by forcing everyone to follow the same measures even if we don't have the same problems.

Or creating yet, a bigger immigration movement to welfare states.

&gt;and it must include early forms of pan-European democracy, perhaps something along the lines of what 

People from each country would have less of a voice. Transferring the powers of a national government to Brussels wouldn't be an early form of pan-European democracy, but more along the lines of an undemocratic Europe.

J'ai fait un post là-dessus, il y a un moment, j'ai la flemme de chercher. Mais en résumé, je me suis coupé de l'IRL pendant bien 6-8 années, que j'ai passées IG, surtout sur WoW. Maintenant que c'est du passé, rétrospectivement en pesant le pour et le contre, ce n'était pas une mauvaise période. Ce que j'ai perdu en relations sociales directes, je l'ai récupéré dans les relations de profondeur : de rares personnes que je connaissais parfaitement, et beaucoup, beaucoup d'appris sur la nature humaine profonde...  
Plus, beaucoup d'autres domaines qui fort heureusement sont transposables vers l'IRL.

Ahah, 120kg, c'est pour cacher le poids réel :D  
J'en ai parlé avec mon médecin, lui-même grand sportif, et il n'y voit pas de risque majeur.

&gt; Par rapport à ce que tu dis sur tes phobies sociales, ne fait surtout pas un sport qui consite à soulever de la fonte tout seul dans un coin de la salle. Fait un truc (individuel ou collectif) qui se fait en groupe. Pas forcément un sport co, du tennis ou de l'escalade où il te faut un binome c'est pas mal non plus. Le but c'est aussi de discuter avec d'autres gens. (Et en bonus c'est souvent moins cher qu'un abonnement à une salle de gym)   

Une amie sportive m'a conseillé la salle de muscu où elle va, et y'a toujours du monde sympa, apparemment. J'essaierai. J'ai été très ""sports collectifs"" et non, ce n'est vraiment pas mon truc.

He made his ideas well know before he became minister and was appointed, presumably on the basis of those ideas. He told the New Statesman
&gt; there was point blank refusal to engage in economic arguments. You put forward an argument that you’ve really worked on – to make sure it’s logically coherent – and you’re just faced with blank stares. And that’s startling, **for somebody who’s used to academic debate. … The other side always engages.** Well there was no engagement at all. It was not even annoyance, it was as if one had not spoken.

So he was naive to go into high-level political meetings and expect open rational argument attempting to arrive at a mutually benefitial solution, but game theory this isn't. On the one hand it's a sad that everybody automatically expects EU negotiations to be full of games, of bluffs and ultimatums and when a guy shows up who says what he means and means what he says the reaction is the same as if he'd let off a loud fart at a fancy party. On the other hand, I wonder why hostile news articles always refer to him as a 'game theorist' and not 'a Marxist' or 'a critic of the global financial system' - are they worried about accidentally making him more popular.

allora, il crash course per la composizione di una canzone è: 

1) decidi una nota da cui partire (es. LA)

2) decidi una scala (es. minore o maggiore, ma ce ne sono altre, supponiamo minore)

tutto il resto viene quasi di conseguenza, con queste due scelte hai già vincolato tutte le note in scala e tutti gli accordi della scala. (es. in LA minore le note sono: la si do re mi fa sol; gli accordi sono: LAm, SIdim, DO, REm, MIm, FA, SOL) (eventuali accordi alternativi si possono ottenere aggiungendo altre note della scala, e.g. FA maggiore + mi = FA7maj)

ora per fare una canzone una versione easy è usare una progressione ""comune"" di accordi (google progressioni comuni o common chord progressions), esempio: i - VII - VI - v (vale a dire: primo accordo minore, poi settimo, poi sesto, poi quinto minore, quindi LAm, SOL, FA, MIm) (altro pro tip: google ""common chord substitutions"", per regole oscure puoi sostituire un accordo con un'altro fuori scala, ora non ricordo la regola)

riguardo la linea melodica mi pare che non ci sia una regola precisa, se non quella che all'inizio del loop dovresti toccare la tonica o la dominante (prima o quinta nota della scala, quindi la o mi) e magari che la penultima nota del loop sia qualcosa di più ""sospeso"" tipo la settima (sol) (insomma sperimenta)

venendo al ritornello, anche qui secondo me non c'è una regola precisa, ma tendenzialmente la canzone prende un ritmo più ""serrato"", o accelerando i cambi, o con progressioni meno complesse, tipo  i - VII - i - v per restare nell'esempio di prima, o cambiando tonalità; per il cambio di tonalità la regola è in pratica che non bisogna allontanarsi troppo dalla vecchia tonalità, ad esempio passando alla relativa maggiore (e.g. da LAm a DO, le note sono le stesse, quindi nessun allontanamento in pratica, devi solo ricalcolare la progressione di accordi) oppure spostandoti lungo il [circolo delle quinte](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circolo_delle_quinte) (quindi ad es. dal LAm le tonalità più vicine dovrebbero essere MIm, REm, oppure FA, SOL)

Ja, das ist allen egal und genau das ist das Problem. Die Forderung nach geschlechtergerechter Sprache triggert Leute wie dich so sehr, dass sie vor lauter Empörung das ganz große Bedürfnis haben, sich zum Affen zu machen. ""Gendernazis"" - meine Güte, eine Nummer kleiner geht es nicht?

&gt;dass scheinbar sämtliche Antisexisten (die mit den Sternchen halt) versuchen, der gesamten akademischen Gemeinde ihre Vorstellung von korrekt gegenderten Texten aufzuzwingen

Dafür, dass es auf einmal ""scheinbar alle"" sind, hast du dich bis eben aber noch ganz schön weit aus dem Fenster gelehnt. In Wirklichkeit gibt noch nicht einmal das (immer noch unbelegte) Beispiel aus dem Artikel deinen Schluss her. No reals, only feels.

&gt;obwohl die vorgebrachte angebliche Diskriminierung für den Durchschnittsbürger schlicht und ergreifend eingebildet wirkt

Die Gefühle des Durchschnittsbürgers diktieren - Gott sei Dank - nicht die Ergebnisse der Wissenschaft. Entscheidend sind hingegen z.B. (empirische) Studien zur Diskriminierung in der Sprache. Ich kann dir gerne entsprechende Studien raussuchen, wenn deinerseits Interesse besteht - dann kannst du dir in Zukunft ein 'angeblich' sparen.

&gt;Und da geht es auch garnicht um diesen einen konkreten Vorfall, sondern die Tatsache dass diese Sau seit mehreren Jahren regelmäßig wieder durch's Dorf getrieben wird und es niemanden außer den Gendernazis interessiert.

Übersetzung: Ich muss nur ""Gender"" hören und schon kann ich nicht mehr beim Thema bleiben und obwohl mir das Thema total egal ist, muss ich kommentieren. Ach Gotterchen, mach doch das nächste Mal einfach die Augen zu. Auch sonst ist das Unsinn, das Verhältnis von Sprache und Geschlecht interessiert natürlich ganz viele unterschiedliche Menschen - z.B. Psychologen, Soziologen und Linguisten. Ganz gleich, ob das dem Durchschnittsbürger (also dir) behagt oder nicht.

I am going to do that.

After living in Athens for 4 months and marrying there, having my first touchscreen device sent over from Cyprus, and importing Greek olive oil from a farmer who is the friend of my family-in-law since 2012, I am super positive about the way Greeks treat you as a customer. Service-minded, polite, and hard-working to an extent that puts Danish people to shame unless you go somewhere expensive. Having your furniture driven from Greece to Denmark by truck is expensive, but we found a cheap company in Athens that went to exceptional lengths with the driver even staying an extra unplanned day to wait for us to get the key before being able to unload his stuff — no extra charge.

Greeks are not necessarily master manufacturers when dealing with metal (have had a few minor issues with a bike and my current bed, both manufactured there), but most of my furniture made in wood is from there and is quite excellent. I can't enter a bakery in Denmark without missing the superior bakeries in Athens. I say so at the peril of being called a traitor by fellow Danes ;) My favorite dress suit was also bought in Athens. Their product range has lots of great options for color and patterns that I can't find locally. Here, everyone only wears black or grey suits. Can't stand it.

The two big worries I have about buying online are 1) that I am unsure if the shipped products would make it safely to Denmark, and 2) that I do not speak Greek. My wife is fluent, though, and I'll need to bite the bullet and learn more than the alphabet soon, anyway.

Pro Tip: Mit Bier, Einweggrill und ein paar Bangers aus'm Sainsbury  machst du dir auch bei den zahllosen Gruppen am Strand schnell Freunde, die dort rumsitzen und Gitarre spielen oder Fackeln jonglieren.

Without monetary sovereignty, no. You're quite right here. Granted, this isn't a morality play. The fact remains that austerity doesn't address the situation at hand, debt sustainability.

You could make the argument that there should be some degree of debt reduction, but to suggest that the Greek government is even capable of consistently running a medium-term surplus of 3.5% is, quite frankly, ludicrous. 

A continuation of the deficit reduction as mandated in the memorandum is going to result in economic contraction, further reducing the actual income generated by both real and gross economic activity. It's a vicious cycle that can't be solved via austerity policies.

&gt; Merkel pikiert über Ackermanns Griechenland-Zweifel [..] Der Chef der Deutschen Bank hatte sich zur Frage, ob das krisengeschüttelte Griechenland jemals in der Lage sei, seine Verbindlichkeiten begleichen zu können, skeptisch gegeben. Er bezweifle, ""ob Griechenland über die Zeit wirklich in der Lage ist, diese Leistungskraft aufzubringen."" Denn dazu bedürfe es ""unglaublicher Anstrengungen"", sagte er in der ZDF-Sendung Maybrit Illner. [..] Die stellvertretende Regierungssprecherin Sabine Heimbach sagte zwar, eine ""öffentliche Rüge"" sei nicht die Art der Bundeskanzlerin. Sie sprach aber auch davon, dass es zu Spekulationen über Schuldentilgung ""keinen Anlass und keinen Nutzen"" gibt. Grundlage für die Entscheidung der Euro-Länder zu Kredithilfen an das Land seien Bewertungen von EU-Kommission, der Europäischen Zentralbank und des Internationalen Währungsfonds gewesen.

Interesting. I actually work in politics and have quit bothering to distinguish between ""lying"" and being ""wrong."" Lying shows you know the facts and misrepresent them; being wrong shows laziness for not having done the proper research. You may not consider them of equal vice, but I find they usually produce similar results- in this instance the suffering of Greek people. By any rational account it was extremely naive for Syriza to assume they had a high amount of leverage in these negotiations and demonstrates irresponsibility to their constituents.

I can, however, appreciate their sincerity in sticking to the ideals that got them elected.

&gt; public opinion in many countries (Germany, NL, Finland) has been driven by a media narrative which trivialises the economics and emphasises the 'morals' of this story.

The sentiment I've been gathering is that although it's a pathetic situation that Greeks are in, and easy to morally feel obligated to help them, at what point do you economically draw a line?

&gt; we should be borrowing more, spending more, trying desperately to 'overheat' the Eurozone to kick start the economy into life. But this is something which is politically not welcome and further not 'intuitively obvious'.

This question is at the heart of my struggle to understand a viable solution. Would increased money work? I stated in an earlier comment that I would normally support additional spending, but for Greece I have a hard time. Past governments in Greece have shown they cannot be trusted, and these measures would not have helped. The Syriza party may be more trustworthy, but the way they have handled these negotiations doesn't allow me to believe they're competent enough to properly handle this additional sum of borrowed money. One idea I had read that seemed intuitive was that there may be some sort of a haircut if at some point in the next three years Greece handles their finances well.

Needless to say, I'm very curious to see the results of this 85 b. euros. Syriza has unprecedented support and could make some really positive economic impacts. It seems many Greeks fear the worst from the bailout deals, but as an outsider I would like to see this bailout as being an important the first step towards recovery. But that's also what many said in 2010.",null,0,null,1436971195,null,0,1436971826,0,ct46447,null,t3_3d8zt7,null,t1_ct46447,null,t1_ct3fw41,null,null,null,1437870998,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

What I was more getting at is that the left for instance here wants to keep the wage indexation: salaries will follow inflation. It's never really been a problem as salaries usually rise faster than inflation in all countries, but as Germany has been putting wages on lockdown, that measure is coming under increasing pressure as our wage handicap with Germany increases as their wages increase below inflation levels (which is rare). We're losing business to Germany because of it, and business are becoming ever more mobile so that pressure will only increase and not be limited to merely low-skilled labor.

Anything the left would like to implement to make life a little easier for most citizens and especially the lower classes is met with the argument ""but how do compete with Germany if we implement this?""

A unified but more social Europe could perhaps create some more pressure on the right: if they can afford this for their citizens, why can't we?

The Byzantine GDP per capita has been estimated by the World Bank economist Branko Milanovic to range from **$1071.94 to $1375.65 in 1990 International Dollars (with inflation counted to give a more modern description) at its peak around 1000 AD (reign of Basil II).**[86] This corresponds to a range of **$1935 to $2483** in today's dollars.
 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_economy

All and all, it is certain and agreed by all historians that Byzantium for about 10 centuries was the world epicenter in arts, literature, architecture, economy etc.
The west helped to its destruction with the 4th crusade and was able to catch up only after the Byzantium was lost and mostly because of the start of colonialism.

Übernachtung in Edinburgh ist auch viel günstiger als in London. Obwohl die beiden Städte beliebte Touristenziele sind, hat Edinburgh etwas bessere Atmosphäre, da die Stadt kleiner, freundlicher und angenehmer ist. Mir gefällt die Stadt super weil sie wir ein Märchen wunderschön ist.

Da wir für den Geburtstag meines Freundes in einen kurzen und romantischen Urlaub fahren möchten, haben wir den Flugticket einfach so gebucht. Es stellte sich heraus, dass Edinburgh außer der romantischen Atmosphere ganz viel anders zu bieten hat! Innerhalb 3 Tagen haben wir nicht geschafft, die empfohlenen Orte zu besuchen. Arthur's Seat und Das Castle ist ein Muss. Ein Tag waren wir nur auf der Royal Mile, um zu essen, trinken, und die Leute zu beobachten. Abends gibt es ausreichend Pubs und Clubs. Also, du kannst sicherlich in Edinburgh eine gute Zeit haben, solang du dort unter 3 Wochen bleiben möchtest! Viel Spass!

Na, wenn's dich provoziert hat, hat's ja funktioniert. ;-)

Die Forderung nach geschlechtergerechter Sprache triggert mich null. Die ständige Forderung nach dieser Sprache, und das öffentliche zur-Sau-machen von Leuten, die sich an diese Gepflogenheiten nicht halten wollen, ist mein Kritikpunkt. Es geht mir auch garnicht darum ob da jetzt jemand diskriminiert wird oder nicht, sondern primär darum dass bisher sämtliche Ansätze von Textgendering den Text bis zur Unlesbarkeit entstellen, das aber nicht als Problem wahrgenommen wird. Das war schon vor 2 Jahren so - Kritik an der Systematik, mit der gegendert wird, wird als Kritik am Vorhaben als solches abgeschmettert. Die Antisexisten machen auf mich nicht den Eindruck, dass sie eine echte Lösung verfolgen. Heute wie vor 2 Jahren nicht.

&gt; No reals, only feels.

Niemand hier hat den Anspruch, nur über Fakten zu reden. Ich hab' meine Meinung, inklusive meiner Eindrücke der Gesellschaft, abgesondert weil mir diese ganze Thematik seit Jahren schon zum Halse raushängt und es augenscheinlich immer nur darum geht, sich gegenseitig eine reinzuwürgen. Deinen Tipp, beim nächsten mal doch die Augen zu zu machen, kann ich hier nur dankend erwidern. ;-)

&gt; Die Gefühle des Durchschnittsbürgers diktieren - Gott sei Dank - nicht die Ergebnisse der Wissenschaft.

Dem schließe ich mich uneingeschränkt an. Dennoch wirkt dieser ganze Themenkomplex auf die meisten Leute so, dass das Problem nur in der Einbildung der Antisexisten existiert, und das mag durchaus der Empirie widersprechen. Wir haben halt Glaubensfreiheit.

&gt; Oh, die Verlautbarung des Zentralrats der Transsexuellen, dass Transsexuelle kollektiv keine Antisexisten sein wollen und kein Problem mit nicht-gegenderter Sprache haben muss ich verpasst haben! Oder waren das vielleicht auch nur angeblich scheinbar gefühlt ziemlich sämtliche Transsexuellen?

&gt;They insisted on a “comprehensive agreement”, which meant they wanted to talk about everything. My interpretation is that when you want to talk about everything, you don’t want to talk about anything. But we went along with that.

&gt;And look there were absolutely no positions put forward on anything by them. So they would… let me give you an example. They would say we need all your data on the fiscal path on which Greek finds itself, we need all the data on state-owned enterprises. So we spent a lot of time trying to provide them with all the data and answering questionnaires and having countless meetings providing the data.

&gt;So that would be the first phase. The second phase was where they’d ask us what we intended to do on VAT. They would then reject our proposal but wouldn’t come up with a proposal of their own. And then, before we would get a chance to agree on VAT with them, they would shift to another issue, like privatisation. They would ask what we want to do about privatisation, we put something forward, they would reject it. Then they’d move onto another topic, like pensions, from there to product markets, from there to labour relations, from labour relations to all sorts of things right? So it was like a cat chasing its own tail.

People who aren't Varoufakis fanboys might want to treat whatever he says with scepticism, but I think his account is consistent with what you could see from the outside.

I am quite coherent in that respect. Democracy is pragmatic compromise. With elections, politicians tell what they stand for, but of course due to the essence of parliamentary democracy, they have to compromise  -- some view this compromise as lying or betrayal. 

 &gt;But besides: not having any real profile but going whichever way the wind blows is not being more democratic it's being spineless

Politicians are conformists (see political correctness). They have to please the majority and fear losing votes if they don't. 

If she goes with the majority flow she is *spineless*. If she does not, she is lying, deceiving or betraying democracy. 

At this point, it becomes a scenario of *damned if you do and damned if you don't*.

Sometimes, I wonder if people actually understand democracy.

They are not going to Berlin, Frankfurt and Paris to pull their dick out on the table and proclaim :"" y'all stupid, here what u should do"".

Its rather rude, undiplomatic and borderline stupid to say that to your biggest Allies and puts them into spotlight in a negative way. Even the news itself is an indication of the fact that Washington/New York is not too happy and wants a better understanding of inner European flows. 


U.S will react based on the information mr.Lew will get and what signals he will receive from Europe, but i highly doubt it would be cowboy like behavior.

Party membership was closed early in the war due to the numbers of johnny-come-latelys that wanted the benefits of membership, so the SS was the only route to get those benefits once that happened.  The SS was a complex organization that is not easily reduced to 'wanting to oppress non-aryans'.  Also there had existed conscription for the Waffen-SS since the mid-1930s too:

The SS was given the lowest priority for recruits.[13]
Even with the difficulties presented by the quota system, Heinrich Himmler formed two new SS regiments, the SS Germania and SS Deutschland, which together with the Leibstandarte and a communications unit made up the SS-VT.[13]

Das heißt, Du hast nur gekifft, aber nicht geraucht? Joa, das gibt's schon, aber die meisten, wenn nicht alle Leute, die ich kenne und die regelmäßig kiffen, rauchen auch und schaffen es trotzdem nicht, längerfristig vom Gras wegzukommen, da die psyschiche Abhängigkeit anscheinend viel zu hoch ist. Sie haben schon häufiger versucht, vom Gras wegzukommen, was natürlich schon eine Einsicht zeigt, daß die Abhängigkeit wohl doch vorhanden ist, vor allem, wenn man es dann mal wieder nicht schafft. Allerdings sind die Leute schon etwas älter. Ich denke, daß viele, die mit 16 anfangen, zu kiffen, die Gefahren (gerade was das Suchtpotential betrifft) völlig unterschätzen, und in der Öffentlichkeit/Schule wird meiner Wahrnehmung nach immer nur pauschal darüber diskutiert, ob Gras nun legalisiert werden sollte oder nicht, anstatt sich wirklich mal mit den Pros und Contras auseinanderzusetzen. Da wird Gras dann oft mit Sprit verglichen und nicht isoliert genug betrachtet. Von völlig verblendeten Gestalten wie denen auf /trees mal ganz zu schweigen. 

Um es klarzustellen, ich bin nicht per se gegen den Graskonsum, ich denke nur, daß man auch als Befürworter oder Kiffer selbst das Thema etwas differenzierter betrachten sollte. Über die tatsächlichen Gefahren von Alkohol wird schon seit vielen Jahren immer wieder und überall berichtet, bei Gras sollte dies, speziell falls/bevor es legalisiert werden sollte, auch geschehen, da sonst vermutlich viele jugendliche Kiffer das Ganze als Legitimisierung des Konsums einer nicht ganz ungefährlichen, aber vermeintlich ungefährlichen Droge sehen.

I think it is essential. Walking on the brink of a default is *not* stable or sustainable. Sure, the financial crisis helped to push them over the ledge, but it is still driving without a seatbelt. The government also tried to move the ledge when they decided to falsified national accounts and it backfired when they had to admit it.

Giving someone a loan holds the risk that he will not be able to pay it back in the future, therefore you assess its behavior in the past to determine the risk. That's why it is important why they have debt in the first place.

&gt; Where did I say that others states should not be able to use such emergency measures?

You did not, but there was no majority to do so. Solidarity is not an unconditional fail-safe for irresponsible actions; bailing out each and everyone unconditionally would not create the incentive to have a sustainable budget. Why have a balanced budget if you can borrow as much money as you want and someone else bails you out?

&gt;Additionally, why were the banks bailed out without hesitation then?

In order to prevent further disturbances on the global financial market and the resulting recession. Since it is global it would have affected everyone and especially worsened the already tense situation in Spain, Italy and Portugal.

Outside, where we buy in $ and sell in $, we have still an advantage because our added value through domestic work, branding etc. factors in EUR and gets cheaper, the % of imported parts does not get more expensive for the customer. Our manufacturer will win sales internationally

And obviously, it makes it attractive for manufacturers to swap external suppliers for domestic ones, another win for the German (or EZ) economy.

The only ones who are worse off are you and me if we want to buy imported goods. And by proxy, importers suffer. Our manufacturers pop champagne right now.

&gt; My country didn't loose any war, by the way, it has imploded from within due to internal crisis that was managed piss-poorly. Just so you know.

And lost the war. Don't be shy about compounding the failures; your country collapsed due to decades of incredibly poor economic and legal mismanagement, baffling policy and infrastructure choices and spending billions on a military it couldn't afford which helped foster the systemic corruption at every level which tore it apart.

And thus lost the war.

It's like if Nazi Germany were staffed with idiots as well as fascists. Except of course Germany doesn't have a former SS agent running the country.

The ECB has strict technical rules on ELA: solvency and collateral are the only criteria.

Greek banks have been technically insolvent for a long time, and the long relatively slow bank run they have been experiencing well before recent events made this state even worse. So, only their collateral, i.e. mostly Greek government bonds mattered.

When Tsipras et al. closed the door to ongoing negotiations and defaulted to the international lender of last resort, i.e. the IMF, the ECB's hands were tied. They had to at **least** freeze ELA (no further increases). In fact, several Council members were pushing for more, i.e. for ELA to be removed entirely.

So, no, there is absolutely no way the ECB could have acted any differently towards Greek banks under treaty and ECB rules.

Also, it was not the ECB that closed the banks, which they cannot, it was part of much larger capital controls instituted by the Greek government, including the now resigned finance minister Varoufakis.",null,0,null,1436974277,null,0,1436974585,0,ct4814z,null,t3_3ddw7t,null,t1_ct4814z,null,t1_ct47a91,null,null,null,1437871451,null,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5,null

""Monetary sovereignty"" only means one thing: let the government print away the nation's internal debt at the expense of the people, by forcing their impoverishment.

This fixes nothing.  It's just a ruse to magically come up with money out of thin air while everyone is left to foot the bill.

&gt;  The fact remains that austerity doesn't address the situation at hand, debt sustainability.

Quite the opposite.

Debt is only a problem if the government keeps on increasing it by running deficits and refusing to balance its books.

The only way to fix a problem caused by piling on loans after loans is to stop requiring loans after loans to keep the state functioning.

And this is done with a combination of two approaches: cut spending and increase tax revenue.

Also known as... austerity.

Ramping up the money printers solves no problem at all, if the problem is overspending.  Ask Zimbabwe.

Furthermore, ""debt sustainability"" is a false problem.  Debts are managed, and it's up to the government to decide what's the best way to manage their nation's debt.  All nations refinance their debt whenever its convenient for them.  I don't see how Greece is any different from anyone.   In the process, debt repayments should be scheduled and planned accordingly.

Socialist governments love printing money, because this reduces the nation's internal debt, impoverishes the nation which means reduced labour costs, and puts pressure on imports.

Additionally, governments aren't really held accountable by their actions, nor does the people understand how they are being slowly boiled by the government's ""monetary sovereignty"".  Then, once the people complain about how ""everything is so expensive nowadays"", the populist government takes the state and blames everything on ""capitalism"" or ""evil empires"" keeping the glorious revolution down, and in the process they might even throw a bone by announcing wage hikes, paid in full by the money printers of course.

That's the main reason why socialist governments love their money printers: they have everything to gain by using them.

I noticed how much better the US entertainment and the acting is. Since then I mostly lost interest in german productions. Today I rarely watch german TV, and its mostly political (""Phoenix Runde"", ""Phoenix - Der Tag"", ""tagesthemen""), cultural (Bachmann-Preis on 3Sat) or a show (""Schlag den Raab"", ""Joko gegen Klaas"", ""Das ist Spitze!"", ""Zimmer frei!"", ""Inas Nacht"").

- Government corruption: its policies serve private interests rather than Spain's interests, slowing economy and declining competitiveness.

- Did not the necessary cuts and reforms: eliminate the councils, reform the senate, eliminate church financing, prosecute fraud, reform SICAVs great tax advantages, combat tax evasion, combat tax havens, corporations and organized fraud schemes, promote employment, banks reforms to prevent this happening again, etc.

- Saved banks with public money -€51 billions- but did not investigate for responsibilities. At least €44 billions are officially lost and €2.6 billions are already recovered.

- European Union's problems: currency policies disfavours weaker countries. This is economic basics, and it was predicted. Observe GDP evolution in the eurozone. Since this was predicted, there were some ""Cohesion Funds"" which europe gave  to Greece, Portugal, Spain, etc, when there was *no need* increasing the bubble and giving corrupted politicians more to steal, and in the recession they were removed.

- The goverment has applied cosmetics this year to increase the GPD.

- The real deficit in the last 4 years is worse than the published. The Government bond increased by +15,5% in 2012 due to bank bailout, but the government published a 7,1% deficit. 

- And there is a hidden waste of at least +4% of the GPD. There is are some reserve funds mainly for pensions which is being used too soon, since it was supposed to be to compensate the pyramid population in the future. Rajoy has wasted €43 billions in these 4 years.

But: Spain is a industrialized serious country with many extraordinary competent workers that will make it grow even with bad politics. We will fix this, I'm sure.

null,false,GirasoleDE,null,null,null,"&gt;Hayek first visited Pinochet’s Chile in 1977, when he was 78. Amnesty International had already provided him with ample evidence of Pinochet’s crimes—much to his annoyance—but he went anyway. He met with Pinochet and other government officials, who he described as “educated, reasonable, and insightful men.” According to the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, Hayek

&gt;""told reporters that he talked to Pinochet about the issue of limited democracy and representative government….He said that in his writings he showed that unlimited democracy does not work because it creates forces that in the end destroy democracy. He said that the head of state listened carefully and that he had asked him to provide him with the documents he had written on this issue.""

&gt;Hayek complied with the dictator’s request. He had his secretary send a draft of what eventually became chapter 17—“A Model Constitution”—of the third volume of Law, Legislation and Liberty. That chapter includes a section on “Emergency Powers,” which defends temporary dictatorships when “the long-run preservation” of a free society is threatened. “Long run” is an elastic phrase, and by free society Hayek doesn’t mean liberal democracy. He has something more particular and peculiar in mind: “that the coercive powers of government are restricted to the enforcement of universal rules of just conduct, and cannot be used for the achievement of particular purposes.” That last phrase is doing a lot of the work here: Hayek believed, for example, that the effort to secure a specific distribution of wealth constituted the pursuit of a particular purpose. So the threats to a free society might not simply come from international or civil war. Nor must they be imminent. As other parts of the text make clear, those threats could just as likely come from creeping social democracy at home. If the visions of Gunnar Myrdal and John Kenneth Galbraith were realized, Hayek writes, it would produce “a wholly rigid economic structure which…only the force of some dictatorial power could break.”

&gt;Hayek came away from Chile convinced that an international propaganda campaign had been unfairly waged against the Pinochet regime (and made explicit comparison to the campaign being waged against South Africa’s apartheid regime). He set about to counter that campaign.

&gt;He immediately wrote a report lambasting human rights critics of the regime and sought to have it published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The editor of this market-friendly newspaper refused, fearing that it would brand Hayek as “a second Chile-Strauss.” (Franz Josef Strauss was a right-wing German politician who had visited Chile in 1977 and met with Pinochet. His views were roundly repudiated by both the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats in Germany.) Hayek was incensed. He broke off all relations with the paper, explaining that if Strauss had indeed been “attacked for his support for Chile he deserves to be congratulated for his courage.”

I don't blame people for being right-wing. I think they're working against the best interest of workers in their country and worldwide, sometimes knowingly, sometimes not, but I don't blame them. To each their own. But when socialists or social-democrats or labour party insist on being identified on the left of the political spectrum but apply right wing politics, I have no choice but to look to their left.

You're probably too hung up on words. Communists and Maoist of 2015 are not communist and Maoist of 1960. Sure, you'll find hardcore believers that make the movement seem crazy, but which party doesn't have that?

Instead of words, focus on ideas. I am against the unlimited accumulation of wealth by any individual, therefore I am anti-capitalist. I believe past a point wealth accumulation should stop and be redistributed. I am against a free and unregulated market, therefore I am anti-liberal. I believe finance and economy should be heavily regulated to limit their destructive and auto-destructive tendencies and force them to focus on real useful economy (with innovation encouraged in that direction instead of speculation). I recognize our planet is the only one we have to sustain human life and that we are actively destroying that ecosystem, therefore I am an ecologist. I believe long term sustainability has to be ingrained in every political decision, fossil fuel and nuclear energy abandoned for renewable energy within a few decades, and that capitalism and liberalism won't produce any messiah that will handle this crisis. I believe in the communist intuition that there are common goods we should make sure everyone has access to for free, like water or air, while capitalists have no problem monetizing these two things. I could list a lot more.

Now all of that is just common sense to me, and are basic tenets upon which we should build our political actions, yet so called socialists will tell me I'm a gentle fool that should come back to my sense because it's 2015 and right winger will simply laugh at me.

Communist, Maoist, it's just heritage, and small fractions of more modern parties anyway. These party believe more or less in the simple things I listed. No totalitarian nightmare or utopia disconnected from reality, like people who call us crazy seem to think. Simple ideas.

I understand that these ideas seem foolish to a lot of people, but it's just politics. I believe it's not only feasible but a good thing to limit wealth and redistribute, others do not. I believe it's a good thing to heavily regulate finance and economy, others think it will stifle growth and innovation. I believe the ecosystem is changing dangerously, others think we'll be fine whatever happens. Etc, etc…

Whatever position that might have scared you is just the political consequences of the basic initial ideas applied to today's world, not blind ideology. It might seem out of place and make your mind run wild when you're not used to approaching problems from our perspective, but there's nothing really extraordinary. Just a refusal to abandon very simple ideals because of some supposed modernity that apparently requires us to be terrible cynical people and act the end of History.

But the whole text is interesting, if one has enough time for that kind of stuff

&gt;By the end of the process, on April 26, after the last foreign law bonds were settled, Greece had achieved total participation of €199.2 billion, or 96.9 percent of eligible principal, resulting in a payout of €29.7 billion in short-term EFSF notes and €62.4 billion in new long sovereign bonds. Hence, the face value of Greece’s debt declined by about €107 billion as the result of the exchange, or 52 percent of the eligible debt.

....


&gt;Debt relief
The present values and haircuts presented in Table 3 may not be a good estimate of the
debt relief received by the Greek sovereign, for three reasons. First, as already
discussed, from the perspective of a debtor country it may be appropriate to apply a
discount rate that reflects expected future borrowing rates over the lifetime of the new
bonds, rather than the yields prevailing immediately after a debt exchange. Second,
Greece borrowed the quasi-cash portion of the “PSI consideration” (€29.7 billion in
short term EFSF notes) from the EFSF. As a long-term liability with relatively low
interest rates (namely, the funding costs of the EFSF plus a small mark-up), its present
value can be expected to be lower than the value of the EFSF notes to investors (except
at very low discount rates). Third, Greece borrowed €25 billion from the EFSF to
compensate Greek banks for PSI related losses.34 The present value of this restructuringrelated
liability must be taken into account when computing the overall debt relief.

Lebst du irgendwo im Schrank in der HU oder einem autonomen Zentrum? Anders kann ich mir nicht erklären, dass eine Minderheitenmeinung, die vermutlich keine praktische Relevanz für dein Leben hat, dich so umtreibt. Letzte Woche haben sich hier alle aufgeführt, weil eine Tutorin verlangt hat, dass Studenten gendergerechte Sprache benutzen. Davor, weil einer darum gebeten hat, mit ""Profx"" angesprochen zu werden. Heute ist es ein ungenanntes Blog, das angeblich irgendwo irgendwas geschrieben hat. Aber schon klar, ständig ist man Opfer!

&gt;dass bisher sämtliche Ansätze von Textgendering den Text bis zur Unlesbarkeit entstellen

Das ist längst widerlegter [Unsinn](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generisches_Maskulinum#Verst.C3.A4ndlichkeit:_Generisches_Maskulinum_und_Alternativformen_im_Vergleich).

&gt;Das war schon vor 2 Jahren so - Kritik an der Systematik, mit der gegendert wird, wird als Kritik am Vorhaben als solches abgeschmettert.

Richtig so, das ist nämlich im Zweifelsfall keine Kritik, sondern das Beharren auf Befindlichkeiten, welche im Widerspruch zum Stand der Forschung stehen. Nach zwei Jahren könnte man ja vielleicht mal Wikipedia anwerfen. 

&gt;Ich hab' meine Meinung, inklusive meiner Eindrücke der Gesellschaft, abgesondert weil mir diese ganze Thematik seit Jahren schon zum Halse raushängt und es augenscheinlich immer nur darum geht, sich gegenseitig eine reinzuwürgen.

Dir hängt ein Thema zum Hals raus, von dem du offensichtlich keinen Schimmer hast. Dir ist egal, ob jemand diskriminiert wird, glaubst aber, Leute, denen das nicht egal ist, belehren zu müssen. Du kennst die Argumente der anderen Seite nicht, bezeichnest ihre Vertreter aber als ""Gendernazis"". Gratuliere zu deiner Meinung.

&gt;Dennoch wirkt dieser ganze Themenkomplex auf die meisten Leute so, dass das Problem nur in der Einbildung der Antisexisten existiert, und das mag durchaus der Empirie widersprechen. Wir haben halt Glaubensfreiheit.

Ja. Du darfst natürlich auch glauben, dass du von Gendernazis umzingelt bist, die dir dein ohnehin schon bescheidenes Textverständnis wegnehmen wollen. Und an Chemtrails. Und Sternzeichen. Aber es wäre erfreulich, wenn du darauf verzichten würdest, Menschen, die deine Meinung nicht teilen, zu beleidigen. Stattdessen könntest du dich deines Verstandes bedienen, deine Annahmen kritisch hinterfragen und die Argumente der Gegenseite zur Kenntnis nehmen.

&gt;&gt;Oh, die Verlautbarung des Zentralrats der Transsexuellen, dass Transsexuelle kollektiv keine Antisexisten sein wollen und kein Problem mit nicht-gegenderter Sprache haben muss ich verpasst haben!

Large trade deficit.




Just a reminder that there was a continent wide credit boom in when the euro was introduced in 2000. And stopped post-2008 when lending became much harder.

Countries like Ireland and Spain had a property bubble due to easy credit. 

Meanwhile Greece had a bubble in government borrowing. 

Italy, France and Germany did not really get involved into either of the two bubbles but benefited from a ""rising tide"" when the world had a lot of cheap lending going around every country. That ended with the 2008 crisis.

Same here. I'm not going voice an opinion on the sentence, I don't have a stake in or an emotional attachment to it.

I'm also not saying he doesn't deserve his sentence, but this has to feel really weird. He was 22 at the time. If I talked to my 22 year old self, I'd probably tell him to shut the fuck up because he doesn't know shit. And I'm only 10 years older. Some of the shit I've said back then makes me cringe to this day.

Either way, the entire trial and its surroundings fascinate me. I might still be alive when there is nobody left alive who lived to see WW2. And by then it will be history the way the US civil war or the Punic Wars are. The potential for human cruelty as shown in WW2 will possibly be ""on paper only"" like medieval torture devices like the [brazen bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazen_bull) are now.

Until the next genocide or big war.

And by running a primary surplus, they continually contract the economy resulting in a reduction of real income generated by both real and gross economic activity. Hence, the vicious cycle of austerity. Did you read what I wrote?

I thought you Dutch have the same disease - either it's perfect or we're **complaining**! Yes, we do a lot of things right, but sometimes Americans seem to think we in central europe and Scandinavia have some kind of utopia and I kinda like bursting that bubble sometimes.

&gt; Wait, so you do have a minimum wage, but it varies by the Union Rating? Who or what decides the minimum wage?

I knew the day would come when I had to explain this system, get your aspirins ready. So, there is no nominal minimum wage that applies for everyone across the board. But, if a company (or companies exmployer union/society/cartel) has a deal with the trade union respecting that particular profession, everybody - even non-union members - in that profession get paid that union rating. 

Now this seems fairly straight forward and already covers most people but it produces problems. If there's a split in the union and you have to do deal with two different unions representing the same profession it's enough to pay the lower rating to all those who aren't members or are members of that union - but both unions still have a right to strike seperately and of course will strike anytime the other one gets a better deal. This is one of the reasons why the train conducter strikes have been happening, and it has been hurting the entire country.

But that's only half of it. There are professions that don't have any union at all. For those, there simply isn't a lowest wage and the market entirely decides. And that's fine when you're talking about CEOs, but for some professions where there are a lot of people working that means that you have no bottom. It also means, because we are a welfare state, that the taxpayer has to pick up the rest of the tab, essentially creating corporate welfare. And the thing is if that company is in trouble I've got no problem with that, but most of those are not in trouble - they are just exploiting people and the taxpayer.

This whole system worked wonderfully when most Germans worked in some factory in union job or small company when you could sit down with the boss and talk it out, but we have people now working in big cooperations without any union representation.

&gt; I see no problem with this... 

Capitalist, get him! 

No, seriously. In theory it's a nice idea, but in practice it means it's flu season you're dying in a waiting room where you have been for two hourse now with 7 people in front of in line - but then Mister ""I have private insurance"" comes in and can go right on in. I'm completely fine with them getting more treatment options, longer hospital stays, better customer service, but our doctors basically outright prefer them - even when you're contemplaiting how much better it would feel right now to just lay down. It's almost insulting and leads to a class society when it comes to health care.

There's also the problem that this kind of preferential treatment drives up premiums, and as I said in another bullet-point, some people don't get public insurance but have to rely on private. Imagine you're a freelancer, don't know how to make rent and then the insurance you didn't actually want in the first place takes a third of your profit that month - leaving you wondering what you're going to eat in week four.

&gt; Here it is 100% for 6 months. Should be none, imo.

1) Find the price of Carris in euros on Jan 1 1999 *and*

2) Calculate what percentage of the average person's income was a single ticket back in 1998 compared to 2015. In other terms how many tickets could the average person afford on Dec 31 1998, Jan 1 1999 and Jan 1 2015. *Then* you get a fair comparison.

First, there is no one who wants to force this policy on any other country: it's a domestic isssue. Second, it's not absolute: in times of crisis, the government can agree to skip one round of wage indexation by 2%. This way, the living standard is safeguarded and if a change would be necessary, it has to happen after an extensive political debate involving all social actors (gov &amp; parliament, unions &amp; employers).

Also, what often happens is that during times of crisis when productivity isn't really growing, consumer prices don't increase either and inflation reaches near-zero level which means the net effect of automatic wage indexation is also near-zero.

However, the German and American model is one of increased productivity without salary adjustments, where the profits don't reach the common people. That's not the model we want for our country, but that model is being forced on us due to competitiveness issues but it doesn't benefit the people either.

I used to be against this indexation thing and thought it was lunacy too, but the effect really is quite limited and often post-crisis reversed by lower voluntary increases. The point just is, the competition push comes from what's best for business, which often coincides with the liberal right wing. Globalization pushes the most liberal policies and forces them everywhere due to competition to stay competitive, with Germany exerting the strongest pressures right now.

null,false,QuirkyQuarQ,EURO,an Old World-er in the New World,null,"BRUSSELS [July 14, 2015]—Germany’s finance chief questioned a tentative bailout deal for Greece, saying that an exit from the currency union might be a better alternative for the country and its citizens.

Mr. Schäuble’s criticism of the deal now, a day after eurozone leaders agreed to new support for Greece, comes at an inopportune time for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was central to hammering out the agreement and must now win support for the deal in Germany’s parliament.

Germany—and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble in particular—have driven a hard line on Greece during months of rescue negotiations, even proposing over the weekend that it take a “timeout” from the currency union. But until now, the chancellor and her finance chief have publicly presented a united front.

His comments are likely to bolster critics of the new aid deal—which requires Greece to pass painful austerity measures and relinquish some fiscal controls in return for tens of billions of euros in loans—in Germany’s parliament. Lawmakers in Berlin are slated to vote on the deal, possibly later this week, once Greece’s parliament has passed the first round of measures, including pension cuts and sales-tax increases.

Asked about the idea of a Greek exit from the eurozone, Mr. Schäuble told journalists “there are many people inside the German government…who believe that this would be, or could be the better solution for Greece and the people in Greece.” He didn’t say whether he was one of them, although many European officials say the hawkish German finance chief has done little to hide his support for a currency union without Greece during crisis talks in recent weeks.

Mr. Schäuble said an exit from the eurozone would require “that Greece takes that decision itself.”

On Sunday, Mr. Schäuble insisted that a negotiated timeout for Greece from the currency union be included in a statement by eurozone finance ministers that served as the basis for discussions at an emergency summit of eurozone leaders Sunday. That section of the statement was later removed by the bloc’s leaders.

But Mr. Schäuble and Ms. Merkel pushed through a demand for Greece to set up a €50 billion privatization fund that would be supervised by European institutions. That requirement was seen as punitive and humiliating by many, including some eurozone policy makers, and would go beyond what was asked of other eurozone countries that received bailouts.

Despite the stringent requirements of the new deal for Greece, some lawmakers from Ms. Merkel’s center-right bloc, the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, have already voiced opposition to a new bailout—Greece’s third in five years.

The Bundestag is almost certain to authorize negotiations for a new aid program later this week, thanks to the support of the government’s center-left coalition partner—the Social Democrats—and opposition parties. But large-scale defections from Ms. Merkel’s own faction would undermine the chancellor’s standing, both within her own party and with voters.

Many Germans now see Mr. Schäuble as the staunchest defender of his taxpayers’ money. This summer he jumped in front of the popular chancellor in public approval ratings.

His comments may also complicate Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s efforts to foster support for a deal that contradicts his antiausterity platform and is much tougher than what voters rejected in a referendum a little over a week ago.

On Tuesday, Mr. Tsipras was trying to rally members of his ruling coalition, which along with his left-wing Syriza party includes the right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks. Opposition parties in Greece support the agreement, which would allow Greece to stay in the euro, but failure to maintain his own majority for new legislation could trigger fresh elections.

The International Monetary Fund, Greece’s biggest creditor outside the eurozone, has also voiced some doubts over Monday’s agreement.

Under the tentative bailout deal, eurozone leaders say they would consider giving Greece more time to repay and reducing interest rates on rescue loans if Greece delivered on promised economic overhauls and budget cuts. But the IMF says that even extending debt maturities deep into the second half of the century might not be enough to put Greece’s debt on a sustainable path.

The fund has said that Greece’s debt could only be made sustainable if the eurozone committed to debt-reduction measures that surpassed anything authorities have been willing to consider so far, including a possible write-down on the value of the country’s debt.

The IMF’s dour debt assessment could bolster Mr. Schäuble’s argument that a Greek exit from the eurozone might be a better alternative than the bailout.

Eurozone leaders made their own rescue loans conditional on continued support from the IMF. The fund’s loans, along with some access to debt markets and increased proceeds from privatizations, could reduce the currency union’s contribution to Greece’s €86 billion financing needs for the next three years. A European official said Tuesday that the eurozone portion of the overall bailout could be between €40 billion and €50 billion.",null,0,null,1436980045,null,0,false,0,ct4bvby,null,t3_3deg3g,null,t1_ct4bvby,null,t3_3deg3g,null,null,null,1437875084,null,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8,null

Yeah, the Americans have no idea how well they do actually -- though we still do better :) Judging by the HDI and 'Better Life index'. 

I remember that the socio-economic status (this includes income) of the lowest 10% in the USA is higher than the lowest 10% in Switzerland. 

Scandinavian lowest 10% was still higher, but their top 10% are lower -- basically unsurprisingly more equality.

I see, well that is a problem -- everybody is basically shifting the burden to someone else. I have been in favour of basic income minimum state instead of a welfare state.

Yeah you got me, don't shoot. My point was that Health care costs are increasing, because there are no incentives to make it more efficient. I recognise that health care does not work in a free market (because supply/demand is skewed), but I am in favour of minimal public financed health care.

Yes (and maternity).

Remember [this chart](http://www.grant-thornton.co.uk/PageFiles/33095/IBR2014_WiB_top_bottom_ten_large.jpg)?

Duesberg e Mullis (quest'ultimo anche premio Nobel grazie ai suoi studi sulla PCR), ma ciò non toglieva che le sue posizioni fossero folli: per farla breve credeva che l'AIDS non fosse altro che un quadro sintomatico provocato in realtà dall'infezione dal mycobacterium tubercolosis (sì, quello della TBC). Questo spiegava anche l'elevata incidenza di AIDS nei paesi africani, in quanto - secondo la sua tesi - la TBC attacca con più facilità le popolazioni africane.

&gt;It is estimated that up to 100,000 Poles were killed by the Ukrainian nationalists during the conflict and another 300,000 made refugees as a result of the ethnic cleansing.[45] According to Timothy Snyder, 40,000-60,000 Polish civilians were killed by the UPA in Volhynia in 1943, and some 25,000 in Eastern Galicia.[38] Conversely, killings of Ukrainians by Poles in Volhynia resulted in between 10,000 and 20,000 deaths in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, while several thousand more were killed by Poles in Polish territory to the west. University of Alberta historian Per Rudling has stated that Shukhevych commanded the UPA during the summer of 1943, when tens of thousands of Poles were massacred.[46] However, the initiator of these massacres was Dmytro Klyachkivsky.[47] They reached their height in July 1943,[48] while Shukhevych did not assume command of the OUN until August 25 of that year and command over the UPA until November 1943.

I don't think it's fair to blame Shukhevych himself for these massacres. All of UPA's main leadership shares culpability for allowing UPA units engage in massacres, but not all of them are guilty of expressly condoning or ordering them.

I am happy to tell you, that these wage restraints are gone now. We've seen the hardest union fights in decades, plus a minimum wage law pass only this year. Wage increases like 4.5% for postmen (&gt;400.000 employees), 3.3% for kindergarten teachers etc.

In the Eurozone wages replace the currency exchange rates. Lowering the wages now has the same effect as devalueing your national currency had, in pre Euro-times. Both cost the same amount of money, through either inflation or lower wages. Both improve the competitiveness.

The same apllies to taxes: Lowering taxes improves competitiviness, and cost money for e.g. social welfare.

If all of us were to act only to our own nation's good, that would lead to a ""race to the bottom"" in both: taxes and wages. And of course, as you already pointed out, in regulations towards banks, health and safety, environment and so on...

And the Euro is important since it helps trade. You can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xAXJx9WJ8) btw.
* Some say that people will be more distanced from politics. Let's be honest, most people don't really know what is happening in the European parliament. But on the other hand, a federation could change this.

As /u/char_char_ as said, basically, it will be the politicians in the European parliament in Brussels who decide the fiscal policies, military, etc..

this guy also lists some pros about democratic represntation in a USE http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-a-United-States-of-Europe-European-Federation-Should-it-be-created

If I said something wrong or that you disagree please tell me :)

Edit: About democratic represntation, in an USE, people would probably choose direcly who they want, instead of the current model, where they choose a party in their country to send deputies to the European Party that the party is associated with. A mess, I know. But I see a problem: if it is so hard to create a new party in your country, because you aren't satified with the current ones, imagine how harder it would be to do so in a massive federation. You would have to make campaign in each state with it's language(since there are a lots of people who don't speak English), and it wouldn't be as easy to get noticed. Possibly we would fall in a two-party system like in the USA(this already happens in many countries).

From what I can gather what's going on is this: The large bailout will be put up for a parliamentary vote in every country. The problem is that the voting will take time. And since Greece is at the brink of collapse money is needed earlier in order to prevent Greece and it's banks from collapsing. One way of getting that money is using the EFSM, a fund created by the European Commission to assist EU members in financial trouble. The money is raised from the financial markets with the EU countries providing guarantees.      
          
The European Commission president has suggested that EFSM money could be used to bridge the gap between now and the arrival of the large Bailout money. The UK disagrees as they were promised the EFSM wasn't going to be used to save the Euro. Some EU lawyers claim that the promise isn't valid because the large bailout is set up to address the Euro problems, while the EFSM money would be something that would prevent Greece and it's banks collapsing.       
         
With the EFSM money each UK citizen would guarantee the security of about 20 Euros in loans to Greece.

&gt;Analysts like Krugman, Weisbrot and Rubini make the utterly good point that Greece would benefit enormously from a devaluation of its currency. Of course it would.

He does say that, but completely fails to provide any arguments that lead to that conclusion. Instead, as I said, he points out Greece's lack of extra export capacity, the dependence of tourism on international prosperity rather than the exchange rate, and makes statements like this:

&gt;In short, even if we neglect the devastation caused by the delay in the introduction of the new currency (something Argentina did not have to worry about), the new currency will be debased ever so quickly due to this bifurcation, leading to hyperinflation and the loss of most of the competitive gains we might have hoped for from the devaluation.

So, while I agree he does put in a single ""of course it would"", he doesn't support that statement anywhere either with facts or argument, doesn't even repeat it, but instead contradicts it repeatedly and at length with both arguments and figures.

[Unemployment is basically the same, maybe a bit higher in Poland](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/RSI/#?vis=nuts1.labourmarket).

1) EE offers potential to develop and 2) East Germany has been declining since 1950. It had lost 15% of its population by 1990 and has remained at that level since then. There is now only a net movement from rural into urban areas.

1) is why its growth rates are larger, because the denominator is smaller. That's not a victory.

2) is happening in Poland (to stay with that example) as well. Its population has been stagnating since 1990.

Altogether, you may feel like Poland is better off, but by any metric it is just approaching East Germany.

null,false,marathon16,GREE,Greece,null,"This discussion between you and /u/jtalin is very good. However jtalin is closer to truth in my view. You effectively propose a prolonged financial hostage as a means to apply pressure to Greeks, which is not the best plan in my opinion. Pressure should be applied, no doubt, and it should be linked to reforms (trust me, those agreed primary surpluses will not be met because the plan is over-optimistic), we don't disagree here. Debt restructuring should not happen before reforms are complete but *there needs to be an agreement right now that if reforms are complete by 20xx then a specific debt restructuring will take place and if reforms delay then the specific debt restructuring will delay but will remain at the same height*. This way you give a clear motive to reform (government: ""Every day we delay reforms it costs us X $ and we risk a future bankruptcy"", opposition: ""We will support reforms, we don't want to inherit a doomed country"", left: ""We work for the poors, the best plan to protect them is to do those damn reforms or we all go down the drain""). Such a formal commitment by all sides would also attract investments in Greece... once reforms start going and the momentum is obvious. This would increase the chance that creditors get most of their money back.

So you basically say that a stabilisation of the political scene is an integral part of the success of the country but at the same time you seem to (i) imply that the plan proposed is socially viable, which I highly doubt (hence my doubts that primary surpluses will be that high), and (ii) that Syriza is not helping. Being in Greece I can say that Syriza is where most of the most angry ones have deposited their hopes on, and the deliberate deconstruction of this leftish party that is attempted by 99% of Europe is *not* beneficial for the stability of Greece. Syriza has to yell, it has to kick and bite because if it does not then the people will do instead, or they might vote for communists or nazis (currently they are at 15-20% combined). The 2 formerly dominant parties are at 35% combined, Syriza alone is at 40% (these before banks closed down, things most likely changed since). The blows it received will weaken it, perhaps kill it.

Ein [Blick auf den Blog](http://hu.blogsport.de/muenkler-watch/) zeigt aber mehr eine kleinteilige Anklage in der jedes Wort und jedes Verhalten auf die Waagschale gelegt wird. Als moralischer Maßstab werden nicht näher begründete Ideologien angelegt. Keine Quelle, keine Grundlage, keine Basis für einen fairen Diskurs. Wenn bei meinen Vorlesungen jedes Wort so auf die Goldwage gelegt werden würde, dann würde man da sicher auch was finden. (Wohlgemerkt: Ich bin kein Prof.)

Im Endeffekt haben wir hier in Blogform was sich auch in Evaluationen zeigt. Ein oder zwei Rückmeldungen aus hundert oder mehr die wirklich Alles in den falschen Hals bekommen. Ich werde durch die Bank weg sehr gut evaluiert und habe bereits Preise für meine Lehrtätigkeit erhalten. Jedoch konzentriere ich mich, wie viele Kollegen auch, auf die paar unfairen, übertriebenen Rückmeldungen. Wenn gegen mich in solch krasser Form online gehetzt werden würde, dann wüsste ich nicht damit umzugehen.

&gt;  der aushalten können muss, dass Studenten den Inhalt seiner Vorlesungen auf obskuren Blogs thematisieren und kritisieren.

Letzten Endes ist das der Knackpunkt. Viele meiner Studierenden verstehen, dass Dozenten auch nur Menschen sind. Die wenigen, die derart krass über die Bande schlagen, sehen aber die Perspektive der Dozenten überhaupt nicht. Dozenten haben jede Belastung auszuhalten, immer sofort bereit zu sein, jede Zusatzaufgabe zu übernehmen, keine Leistung zu fordern, sich nie zu versprechen oder einen schiefen Witz zu machen. Jede Kritik am Dozenten, egal wie krass, unfair oder pedantisch ist ok. Wäre man eben nicht an der Uni geblieben. 

Das Ganze schmerzt umso mehr da Lehre häufig auf Opfern der Dozenten beruht. Viele gehen freiwillig über das hinaus was sie leisten müssen. Jede Stunde mehr in der Lehre bedeutet weniger Publikationen, weniger Forschung, weniger Anträge. Damit auch weniger Räume, weniger Ansehen und Einfluss an der Uni, weniger Erfolg im eigenen Feld. Für die vielen Dozenten, die noch keine Professoren sind, bedeutet jede Stunde Lehrvorbereitung auch, dass es wahrscheinlicher wird aus der Uni zu fliegen und keine Professur zu erlangen.

Und trotzdem setzen wir uns hin und bereiten vor, besprechen, ermuntern, helfen und unterstützen.

Wenn aber solche Blogs der neue Umgang zwischen Studierenden und Dozenten werden, dann gute Nacht. Warum genau soll man für ein winziges Gehalt ein Jahrzehnt oder mehr im akademischen Prekariat bleiben nur für eine Chance auf eine Professur, wenn man dann anonym und ohne klare Belege derart torpediert wird?

Im Endeffekt landen wir dann bei einer Kultur in der die akademische Freiheit stirbt, weil Lehrende Angst vor ihren Studierenden haben.

I don't think that's good economic arithmetic. The growth of the economy will have been an influential factor in inflation, so you can't just multiply one by the other - you're simply squaring some portion of growth.

You can do that, but narrowing a comparison to just a few years doesn't result in anything that's valid to judge wether a currency is good or bad.
