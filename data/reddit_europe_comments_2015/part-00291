- For the senate: just look at the candidates in your circumscription, they are a handful, you can get a decent idea about each of them. If all of the candidates suck, just pick the party who is not governing right now, or a minority party that has no chance to enter parliament.

- For president: we'll have to wait to decide; I'm skeptical that we'll get a better candidate than the current president, though. (Klaus Iohannis, german minority, ex mayor of Sibiu, where he did a fairly good job)

- For mayor: typically doesn't matter, he'll get re-elected.

So because of our previous dealings we should only show gratitude to Russia and not critise it for what it is doing now? Huh?

We are a very long way of from being dependent on US LNG, we probably never will be as we can get LNG from pretty much anywhere. That is the whole point of LNG, you are not limited to fixed infrastructure (and thus fixed suppliers). It will hardly be an issue in the TTIP talks.

And we lost trade because Russia decided to invade eastern Ukraine. What were we supposed to do? Just stand and watch? And what has this to do with buying shale gas? I mean, the one thing we haven't cut of is gas imports. So how do the sanctions lead us to become dependent on US LNG?

And while the sanctions do hurt the European economy, but not to the extend you are saying. Most of these export now not going to Russia will instead be exported elsewhere. Is it bad? Yeah, but not as bad as you make it out to be.

And right now our money is used to feed the Russian economy. If we buy LNG from the US our money will go to feed the US economy. What does it matter? To buy this gas it has to go abroad anyway.

And are you seriously not aware of Russian power politics with gas? Look at what happened in the Ukraine. Russia was definitly meddling in affaires there. The rest of Europe is also vulnerable to 
Russian meddling because we are so dependent on their gas. The implicit threat of cutting of supplies is already enough to influence politics.

It was only founded in 2006 and became the largest party in parliament in 2009. The ""glorious leader"" says stupid things often, but the party seams to have lodged itself close to the average Bulgarians heart, keeping it ~~relevant~~ dominant. It focuses on visible infrastructural investments and the absorption of EU funds and public police operations, but after it's first term it seams to have lost a taste for the latter. They are also a young party and have trouble finding the right fits for minister positions. They are currently in power. Герб/Gerb also means ""coat of arms"" in Bulgarian. I vote for them in ""lesser evil"" judgement call.

Bulgaria was a country that benefited from being in the soviet blok, so their resilience is understandable. They recently suffered a split with a 4th of the party votes leaving with some of it's prominent members to start a minor party allied with GERB. A dieing party, literally in some (morbid) sense.

* **DPS/ДПС - Movement for Rights and Liberties - 14%** - A originally artificial party created to keep Bulgarian Turks controlled in the post socialist times. They rely on minorities to vote for them - mostly gypsies and ethnic Turks, they are left and for integration (on paper). They have the support of many Bulgarian Turks who have become rich thanks to the party. It's a flexible party that will find it's way into any coalition if allowed. It killed the last socialist cabinet by leaving it - forcing elections. That was after we had massive protests for months.

* **RB/РБ - Reformers Bloc - 7%** - The old blues, When communism fell there was BSP and the opposition. This is what survived of it, split up and fighting among themselves the right parties only recently realized they had almost annihilated themselves. Now they stand together out of need as much as anything, allied with GERB. They are right wing in general, but the party is multi-faced and often one part doesn't know what another is doing.

After the fall of communism most emerging political forces were in constant motion, shifting alliances, falling apart and reforming, etc. This, to some extent, keeps happening to this day, but as the scene matured, three parties with stable structures have emerged - the aforementioned PO and PiS, but also SLD, a social-democratic left party, which actually precedes the former two.

SLD won the elections twice, but corruption scandals destroyed its reputation and the party fractured. It is still around and for quite a while remained the third political force, but it has lost its way and kept alienating its supporters, slowly falling into irrelevance, leaving PO and PiS.

That, in short, lead us to where we are.

&gt; I understand the Polish people's distaste for anything even remotely associated with socialism.

That's not exactly how things are. :) Socialism does pretty well here and PiS can be argued to be a socialist party, although it doesn't use that word to market itself to potential voters. And also nationalistic. And conservative. An odd combination, I know, but it seems to appeal to a certain part of the society. Then there's a myriad of socialist parties trying to replace SLD, with SLD trying to find a way to revive itself.

[The Budapest Memorandum.](http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/49/765)

* Point one:  The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to respect the independence and sovereignty and **the existing borders of Ukraine. **

* Point two: The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that **none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine** except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. Sources [A](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28963310) [B](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28934213) [C](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/29/us-ukraine-crisis-prisoners-idUSKCN0HO1MP20140929)

* Point three: The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to **refrain from economic coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest** the exercise by Ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind. [Not really happening yet, but Novorossiya is using the rouble as their currency, not the Hryvnia.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-04/forget-tanks-it-s-russia-s-ruble-that-s-conquering-east-ukraine) please read the full report to get an image of the implications.

* Point four: The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of[4] an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used. *Not actually happening*

* Point five: The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm, in the case of Ukraine, their commitment not to use nuclear weapons against any non-nuclearweapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, except in the case of an attack on themselves, their territories or dependent territories, their armed forces, or their allies, by such a State in association or alliance with a nuclear-weapon State. *Really is just a clause saying that Ukraine can count on Russia, the UK and the USA not to launch a nuclear attack*

* Point six: Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America will consult in the event a situation arises that raises a question concerning these commitments. *The consultation hasn't resulted in an end to the bloodshed*

Basically the apathy of the western nations has lead to another civil war. The UK, my country continues to excel in keeping the promises to protect ~~Belgium~~ ~~Poland~~ Ukraine.

TL:DR I am pissed off with my country for making promises it has no intention of keeping.

SPD: used to be leftist, nowadays more or less centrist (very slightly to the left)

Die Linke: Leftists. Probably doomed to opposition on the federal level until all the Schroeder-era guys from the SPD retire (there's quite some hurt feelings based on the origins of Die Linke in the areas of former western Germany)

Grüne: Used to be strongly leftist. Nowadays also aiming slightly left of center with some green elements.

SSW: only present in Bundesrat (as part of the governing coalition of Schleswig Holstein), regional party for the danish minority in Schleswig Holstein. No real idea about their political views tbh as they aren't particularly known in most of Germany.

null,false,jakub70,EURO,European Union,null,"Here's a run down for Poland:

PiS (Law and Justice) - right-wing, conservative and nationalist party. Even though they call themselves right-wing, they are rather socialist and populist in their economic policy, for example they want to implement a tax on foreign owned supermarkets, etc. Their leader, Jarosław Kaczyński is almost universally despised, so his newest tactic is to not appear in public at all and rule from behind the scenes. He also promotes party moderates such as Andrzej Duda (presidential candidate) and Beata Szydło (candidate for PM) and marginalising extremsists such as Antoni Macierewicz (idiot). It seems to be working: PiS won the recent presidential election (though just barely) and is almost certain to win the parliamentary election this autumn and form a government. Kaczyński used to say that Victor Orban, the Hungarian PM is his role model, though he doesn't anymore, because unlike the latter, Kaczyński is fiercely anti-Russian. Law and Justice is also eurosceptic, they don't want to leave the EU, which is a fringe view in Poland but the are opposed to the introduction of the euro. They are also generally anti-German, partly because WW2 (the party is big on historical nationalist rhethoric), partly because they believe Germany wants to reduce Polish independence. They sit with ECR in the European Parliament.

PO (Civic Platform) - centre-right, christian democratic. They claim to be in favour of the free market and even campaigned for radical tax cuts and rapid privatisation but as soon as they won, they went ""screw this shit. Let's raise taxes, nationalise private pension funds and give endless subsidies to loss-making coal mines"". They party is also (mildly) socially liberal, in favour of civic partnership for gays (a contentious issue in Poland), IVF and somewhat freer (but still very tough) abortion law. They lead the current coalition government. They used to get a lot of votes, mostly ""to keep PiS out"". They made some unpopular decisions, such as raising the retirement age and took part in some, relatively minor, corruption scandals, but the biggest reason for the collapse in support is the fact that people are fatigued after 8 years of their rule and want change, and the appearence of the alternative parties made it possible. Also, their previous, rather well-liked leader, Donald Tusk left for the European Council and was replaced by generally considered to be weak and incompetent Ewa Kopacz. They sit with EPP in the European Parliament.

Kukiz electoral list - an electoral list founded by a rockstar Paweł Kukiz, went from not existing to polling at the third place. There is no point talking about the list, since it exists only as the supply network of Paweł Kukiz. The curious think about Kukiz is that he has no discernible views and opinions on ANY ISSUE. Well, almost no opinons: he believes that we should abolish proprtional representation in the parliament and implement UK-style single member constituencies. When he talks about (and he talks about it a lot), it seems as though he believes it will fix everything that's wrong with the country. Yet in spite of that he managed to get 20% (!) in the presidential election. How is that possible, you might ask. Well, it's mostly the rhetoric he uses:  all politicans are corrupt, political parties are evil, we need to get rid of the political elite, and of he gets to govern, there will be a revolution (it's unclear what will it entail) and everything will be back right again. As such, he attracted a lot of young or otherwise disenfranchised, rebellious voters. It's commonly believed that Kukiz will join PiS as the smaller electoral partner after the elections this year.

NowoczesnaPL (ModernPL) - a centrist, liberal organisation formed by Ryszard Petru, the president of the Society of Polish Economists, an economic think tank. The party has a strongly reformist, free market agenda, their proposals include privatisation of state owned coal mines, promotion of science and technology, education reform, abolishing of privileges for farmers etc. At the moment it's unclear whether or not they will be able to cross the 5% electoral threshold.

PSL (Polish People's Party) - centre-right, christian democratic and agrarian party. The party exists to protect the privileged position of the farmers and ensure that Polish agriculture never becomes large-scale and efficient. They support government handouts to different groups and are rather conservative. They poll at 4% (below electoral threshold), but they tend outpreform the polls. They sit with EPP in the European Parliament.

ZL (United Left) - an electoral alliance of two centre-left parties:

SLD - social democratic party, direct successor to the communists. Used to be very popular, but corrption scandals decimated their vote share. The party generally supports left-wing economic and socially progressive policies, though they didn;t implement much of either when they ruled a decade ago. At this ppoint, the only people supporting them are former communists and national and ethnic minorities (Belarussians, Kashubians).
and 
Twój Ruch (Your Move/Your Movement, it's a double entendre) - centre left, social democratic party, led by Janusz Palikot. In the previous election they got 10%, even though they were largely unknown, and they have proven themselves incompetent and riddiculous people, that should have never entered politics (with some exception, such as Robert Biedroń). Their leader in particular was seen as nothing more than a [derisory eccentric.](http://m.natemat.pl/1ab2266bf334ad12e0ab457f9d7c7f2d,641,0,0,0.jpg) The party was seen as having only issues: sexual minority rights and anticlericalism and their support has collpased.

In spite of the alliance, it seems that ZL will fall short of the electoral threshold, meaning that there might be no left wing party in the next parliament. It might seem strange, but really there seems to be no place for a traditional left-wing party (progressive socialist) in Poland. Poor working class are usually firmly conservative and catholic and vote for PiS and well-off progressive middle class votes for PO and now Kukiz and NowoczesnaPL. 

KORWiN - there is absolutely no chance they will get over 5% of the vote (they poll at 1-2%) so I'm writing this mostly for the laughs. KORWiN is an extreme right ultra-conservative uber free market party that puts Donald Trump to shame. The party party founder was [Janusz Korwin-Mikke](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27oxel/a_name_you_will_hear_probably_a_lot_in_near/) and the party name acronym is KORWiN.Yes, he named the party after himself.

### Conservative and Unionist Party (aka tories, every derogatory insult ever, etc)

Upper-class right-wing tossers who don't want to conserve anything. Strongly against nationalisation and would privatise the monarchy if they could get away with it.

### Labour Party

Lazy gits who have never worked a day in their lives and are recently more like red tories than anything else. You might have heard of their last successful leader war criminal Tony Blair who took us into two American wars which indirectly caused the Islamic State situation. [They might hopefully be changing soon.](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-33624145)

### Liberal Democrats (libdems, liberals, traitors, etc)

A party of few fixed morals. Supposedly liberal even though [they assisted the tories in fucking the country as part of a coalition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcUDkjvssaQ) and recently elected a religious homophobe as leader. They quite rightly got decimated in the recent election and their leader is [so so sorry.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUDjRZ30SNo)

### United Kingdom Independence Party (ukip, swivel eyed loons, etc)

A party who hates the European Union so much that their leader takes [hundreds of thousands of pounds](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/poor-nigel-farage-finds-it-hard-to-get-by-on-109000-a-year-plus-expenses-9901390.html) to be a member of the European Parliament. They claim not to be racist but have had more people kicked out for being racist than all of the other parties put together. A lot of people vote for them as a protest because their leader looks good with a pint in his hand.

### Green Party of England and Wales (greens, dirty hippies, etc)

A pretty typical left wing party which is popular with students. Very similar to what Labour were in the past. Some of their policies are literally insane such as banning jail sentences for women, leaving NATO, turning our military bases into nature habitats and getting rid of all border controls (i.e. unlimited immigration from everywhere). Luckily they're not likely to get any power under FPTP anyway so in my opinion they make a good left wing pressure party.

Full disclosure: this is who I voted for in the election.

### Official Monster Raving Loony Party (monster raving loonies, loonies, etc).

The only sane party in the country. Their former leader was a cat. Their political position is ""sitting and facing forward"". Their policies are just too sensible for me to list here so [check their website](http://www.loonyparty.com/about/policy-proposals/).",null,0,null,1438201249,null,0,1438203161,0,ctkpe85,null,t3_3f1u3r,null,t1_ctkpe85,null,t3_3f1u3r,null,null,null,1440164007,null,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10,null

Half of the rebels (Sinn Féin, Old IRA) signed the treaty, became Cumann na nGael (Fine Gael), half fought against the treaty and remained Sinn Féin. A civil war was fought between the two sides for a year. 

Sinn Féin abstained from politics due to the Oath until 1926 when the party split again into Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin. Fianna Fáil entered politics and became the dominant anti-treaty party. For many years people voted along family lines depending on which side their family fought on in the civil war despite both parties being very similar ideologically.

**Patriotic Front** - a coalition of two nationalist parties. Fifth biggest party. Minority member of the government. Kind of two faced, with one side being Pro EU and Nato while the other is a russophilic circle jerk.

From left to right:

**Die Linke** - Emerged out of the former ruling party of former East Germany at first, and the bulk of their membership are old people that still have some nostalgia for East Germany. Initially they were only focused on issues of East Germany but merged with a small party that split from the SPD to form Die Linke. Their policies are fairly boring: higher taxes for the rich, nationalize banks, open borders, soft euroscepticism, want to exit NATO (very big on antiimperialism), a lot of putinists in the party and a whole lot of populism. Currently attempting to be a more pluralistic and modern left party like SYRIZA, but I doubt that will go anywhere. Officially democratic socialist.

**SPD** - Social democrats. They have a solid voterbase of workers that voted for them since forever, they ever once in a while implement some social measures like minimum wage, but mostly they are a neoliberal party with working-class rhetoric. Implemented the most neoliberal policies Germany has seen under their rule (cut the welfare state, made labor laws more ""flexible""). Is one of the oldest parties of Europe and is struggling at 25%. Foreign-policy wise they are known to be more friendly to Russia.

**Greens** - They are different from your average European Greens in that they are actually fairly relevant and an established party with a whole lot of issues. Their focus is environmentalism and they are behind some of Germany's most famous environmental policies such as ""Pfand"" (paying 25cts extra on plastic bottles which you will get back after you return them) or shutting down nuclear reactors. (They weren't at power, but they had 25% in the polls during Fukushima which lead to Merkel co-opting it, but they still brought the issue on the agenda). Economically they aren't really sure where to stand, somewhat centre-left. Socially they are the most progressive party, esp. when it comes to immigrants and feminism.

**CDU** - Centrist party with Merkel, centre-right without her. Under Merkel this party pretty much implemented whatever was popular in the polls. Their party base is conservative, atlanticist, and pro-austerity/neoliberal.

**CSU** - Bavarian version of the CDU. Much more populist and conservative, however is in favor of welfarestate measures if it suits their conservative agenda. (Like giving mothers that want to raise their children at home extra money)

**AfD** - Right-wing nationalist-populist party, at least after the split. These days talks about things like repopulating Germany/making Germans make children again, is against atlanticism and in favor of cooperation with Russia, against immigration, anti-EU, especially anti-Euro. Uses populist rhetoric concerning ""gender-ideology"" or ""political correctness"" which they believe is a tool of the ruling class to brainwash the population. Very, very critical of this country's media. Linked to PEGIDA. Used to be more liberal-conservative before the split and basically CSU except anti-euro.

**NPD** - Neonazi party whose leadership are government agents, that's all you need to know.",null,0,null,1438201994,null,0,1438202196,0,ctkpy0c,null,t3_3f1u3r,null,t1_ctkpy0c,null,t3_3f1u3r,null,null,null,1440164265,null,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17,null

After the War of Independence the country was very divided in their support for the [Anglo - Irish Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty)

The main points of contention within the treaty were:

* Crown forces would withdraw from most of Ireland.
    Ireland was to become a **self-governing Dominion of the British Empire**, a status shared by Australia, Canada, Newfoundland, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa.

* As with the other Dominions, the **King would be the Head of State** of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) and would be **represented by a Governor General (Representative of the Crown).**

* Members of the new free state's parliament would be **required to take an Oath of Allegiance** to the Irish Free State. A secondary **part of the Oath was to ""be faithful to His Majesty King George V, His heirs and successors by law**, in virtue of the common citizenship"".

* **Northern Ireland** (which had been created earlier by the Government of Ireland Act) would have the option of withdrawing from the Irish Free State within one month of the Treaty coming into effect.

These conditions were unacceptable to a lot of the Irish population at the time, who wanted a full republic. The treaty was accepted by voters, however the context was Churchill had promised there would **""Immediate and terrible war""** [with Britain, again] should the treaty be rejected.

The government of Ireland ever since has swapped back and forth between these two parties, and a lot of people still vote for whichever side their grandparents supported. 

The Civil war was a complete mess, where brothers literally fought against each other, around twice as many were killed than in the War of Independence, and all the politics for the next 80 years were somehow affected by it.

* **Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S)** is an anomaly of political science that I'm sure will be studied for years to come, a movement that has actually managed to coalesce and remain stable. The M5S is most definitely not a normal anti-sistemic party like Syriza or PODEMOS, and it's probably not a party at all, as it adamantly refuses to conform to any left or right category and to employ the normal bureacratic structures that are commonly found in political parties. Anti-sistemic, pro direct democracy (through the Internet), extremely anti-Europe, the candidates for the the M5S must be completely spotless penally speaking and can only hold any kind of office twice, and then must return to their normal jobs as the *pentastellati* do not believe in politics as a profession. It's a hodgepodge of an electorate, including extreme left-wingers, former Berlusconi voters, uneducated and educated people of all trades and it's reflected on its inconsistent and confusing political program that incorporates right and left. Currently holding a significant but not enormous part of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.

* **Forza Italia (FI)** is Berlusconi's party, 'nuff said. A party, if you could call it that, full of sycophants and opportunists that coalesce around His Emittance for personal gain and readily betray him at every turn. Currently imploding on itself, and constantly losing deputies and senators to the PD. Oscillating between euroskepticism and moderate pro-europeism, whenever it suits them.

* **Area Popolare** is a coalition of small centre left and centre right parties, the biggest of which is not an actual election proven party, but rather a party created when Angelino Alfano, one of Berlusconi right hand men, split from PdL-FI and took some senators and deputies with him, creating the NCD. One of the most important junior partners of the government. Pro-european.

* **Sinistra, Ecologia e Libertà** is a left party lead by the two time Apulia governor and one of the few italian openly gay politicians, Nichi Vendola. Actually leftist, no strings attached, and firmly opposing the moderate PD. Staunchly pro-european federalism.

* **Lega Nord** is a right party, very similar to the UKIP but also very different. Extremely anti-european and anti-immigration, it used to be a very much locally minded party, advocating for a split between Northern and Southern Italy first (and always being extremely hesitant to actually point where the former ends and the latter starts) and federalism after, it has a become a more standard right party and has since dropped federalism and the split from its programs and under the aegis of the new president Matteo Salvini it has been cannibalizing Berlusconi's electorate together with the M5S. Any Italian above 20 however still remembers the outrageous and incredibly offensive rethoric that the Lega Nord employed against immigrant and southern Italians and as such Salvini is frequently booed everywhere that it's not a stronghold of the party (a significant part of Northern Italy).",null,0,null,1438202648,null,0,1438256394,0,ctkqeyv,null,t3_3f1u3r,null,t1_ctkqeyv,null,t3_3f1u3r,null,null,null,1440164487,null,24,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,24,null

Moderaterna: center-liberal (old conservatives)

Socialdemokraterna: Social Democratic, historically the dominant party in Swedish politics.

Miljöpartiet: fancies themselves a center party but are really quite left. Liberalish/socialist environmentalists. You might say that they espouse social responsibility for the environment (and other things). An activist party in a lot of ways.

Vänsterpartiet: More to the left than S (socialist, some would say communist). Very progressive. 

Folkpartiet: Historically the main liberal party. I think that most people see them as a bit boring right now. They tend to care a lot about school related issues and defense and are very pro EU and Nato.

Kristdemokraterna: A liberal value conservative party (really arguably the most conservative party in parliament) that basically no one that isn't a Christian votes for.

Centerpartiet: They started as the farmers and countryside's party but nowadays they are arguably the most radically liberal party in Parliament. Probably because there aren't all that many farmers left these days and most of them vote for S or SD anyway.

Sverigedemokraterna: A very new party that is obsessed with immigrants (and how reducing the rate of immigration can solve every problem). They have very shady (neonazi) roots and owe most of their success to a very charismatic person, Jimmie Åkeson. They claim to be a center party (or else ""unclassifiable"") but are really right leaning (liberal/conservative) populists.",null,1,null,1438202702,null,0,1438203195,0,ctkqgbf,null,t3_3f1u3r,null,t1_ctkqgbf,null,t3_3f1u3r,null,null,null,1440164505,null,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6,null

Some tips

+ You should contact your employer. Maybe he can support you finding a new place.

+ Stay away from Lohausen or any area near the airport or Garath (in the south) or anything directly adjacent to the Hauptbahnhof (main station). My personel favorites are Benrath and Bilk, near the Uni.

Terminology

+ Kaltmiete (KM) = rent excluding electricity, heating and warm water

+ Warmmiete (WM) = rent including the above but often w/o electricity (ask!)

+ Einbauküche (EBK) = kitchenette

+ Kaution = deposit, cash if you haven't got yet a bank account

+ Genossenschaftsanteil = buying into a community fond and paying therefore less rent.

+ Waschküche = a room in the basement where you setup a washing machine.

+ SCHUFA = your credit score. This doesn't apply to you being a foreigner.

The Left party is generally considered by scholars to be antiliberal left or radical left. Fat left (extrême-gauche) is used for parties to the left of the Communists (i.e. Trostkysits and Leninists from LO and the NPA)

&gt; Center party: ideologically mainstream, basically a middle ground between the socialists and the right wing. Depending on the times, in general they lean more to the center right. They're more for the free market, while being socially more progressive.

I don't even understand what party you are talking about. UDI is clearly center-right and is mainly composed of former associates groups of the UMP.

Also has a firm, aristocratic background and some socially conservative backbenchers, who have been somewhat sidelined in favour of the new ""muscular liberalism"". Our current government, and (I think) the oldest continuously existing political party. 

**Labour:** Centre-left. Originated as a socialist movement; Lenin actually wrote an article about them before he took over Russia, calling them a bourgious, fake worker's organisation! Also once had a substantial Trotskyist wing in the 80s who were purged. Took a right turn and became Tory-lite with Blair's election in the 90s; now undergoing a leadership election. The leading candidate, Jeremy Corbyn, may move the party back to the left.

**Liberal Democrats**: Centre, though it's hard to say what they stand for these days. Formerly the party of classical liberalism, the Tory coalition did massive damage to their reputation.

**UKIP:** Bloody immigrants! UKIP are like the old, Thatcher-era Tory party on steroids, and like many of the far-right parties in Europe, blame most things on bloody immigrants and/or the bloody EU. That said, they're not really far-right; their origin isn't in a fascist movement, but an anti-EU one, their platform is strong civic nationalism and a ruthlessly free-market economic policy (formerly, at least; they're trying to lure in dissilusioned Labour voters). 

**Greens**: Mad, mad, mad. They want to pay everyone in the country a ""citizen's income"" and have no real understanding of economics. Their leader famously froze up in an interview when asked basic questions on their economic policies. Beyond that, they're very pro-environment (duh!).

**BNP**: Literally literally Hitler. Seemed to be gaining some popular support 5 years ago, but UKIP took ther jerbs as the anti-immigration party last election and they lost 98% of their support.

-----------------------

**Relevant parties**

-----------------------

**KSČM (Communist party)** - fucking old school commies pretending to be reformed, collecting votes from nostalgic brain-dead seniors. pro-EU

**ČSSD (Social democrats)** - left wing party for working class, although they are not neomarxists as it is common in the west yet, it won't take long until the ""opression olympics"" group within the party will get prevalence. In the meantime they are fairly traditional left that doesn't care about national debt and promises everything to everyone without feminist bullshit and white guilt. pro-EU

**ANO (""YES"")** - Centrist liberal party which is hard to tell whether it's more to right or left. Currently in coaliton with SD, effectively preventing them to increase tax and debt, so from this perspective they are more to right. They are a new party lead by a billionair so they are still a little bit unpredictable and undefined. pro-EU

**KDU-ČSL (Christian democrats)** - Centrist conservative party slightly to the right that will do anything to get into goverment, officially focusing on small businesses, small farmers and support for families with children. Funny thing is that they try to talk about religion as little as possible and they never refer to themselves as ""christian democrats"" but always use the acronym because they don't want to highlight they are religious - they would lose voters. pro-EU

**ODS** - Formerly powerful, now very small conservative right wing party decimated by corruption scandals and bad ruling. Mainly focusing on businesses, the biggest free speech advocate and loudest oposition to any intervention of state to private matters. Eurosceptic (not radical though).

**TOP09** - Liberal right wing party, basically hipsters. They like to invoke Vaclav Havel all the time, very concerned about human rights all over the world, not so much about rights of poor at home. Economicaly the most right wing of all relevant parties - supporting school fees etc... pro-EU

------------------------------------

**Irrelevant parties**

------------------------------------

**Green party** - Brain-dead marxists, the same kind like everywhere in the world. EU

**Pirates** - Idealistic amateurs focusing on transparency and technology. Not so marxist as some of their western counterparts, but they are heading there... pro-EU

**Free people** - UKIP with more positive attitude to imigrants. FUCK EU!

**Friends of beer party (SPP)** - I only know about them that they are friends of beer. My favourite party, I always wonder why they don't win all the elections. What more do you need?

Post excerpts (in english) of the Greek laws that define the crime of treason, and we'll see if I am right or not. Right now we're just arguing for the sake of arguing.

[edit] I looked at Romanian constitution. In fact it doesn't explicitly mention that you require some motivation... simply that (a) you need to be in contact with a foreign oranisation and (b) you need to do [bad stuff] - one of which is ""undermining the national economy"".

So, depending on how one interprets the constitution, under Romanian law Varoufakis could indeed be charged with treason. I still maintain that the law implies that the ""undermining of economy"" was intentional rather than accidental, i.e. ""you had a personal reason to do it"", i.e. ""you were considering something that would only benefit you or a foreign agent, not the country"".

That was the original meaning of my post: if someone may prove that Varoufakis intentionally tanked the Greek economy (e.g. in order to become more popular himself) - that qualifies for treason. If someone can't answer ""why would Varoufakis intentionally tank the Greek economy"" then you didn't prove motivation, thus you didn't prove intent, thus no treason.",null,0,null,1438204388,null,0,1438204996,0,ctkrm8a,null,t3_3ezf4b,null,t1_ctkrm8a,null,t1_ctkqqbq,null,null,null,1440165054,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

null,false,gat3way,BULG,Bulgaria,null,"In terms of taxonomy, they are all descendants of Homo Bolshevikus, also known as BKP, the former Communist party, the mother of people up until 1989. Anyway here are they, by genus and species:

Idiotus Milicionerium - also known as GERB. Evolved from the security apparatus of BKP, mostly from the so called People's millitia, state security and even the firefighter units. Populists widely associated with corruption and nepotism. Wannabe democrats. The alpha male is narcissistic, yet the most intelligent of the flock with IQ between 50 and 60. Putin wannabe - former firefighter, police general, professional football player, has karate black belt, tennis player, doctor honoris causa at Pernik Technical University of PUTKA (which by chance also means a female reproductive organ). They are nowadays mostly found in government administration.

Debilis Nomenclatura - a.k.a BSP or more widely known as the ""red thrash"". Descendants of Bolshevik nomenklatura. Wannabe socialists, known to be the only socialists that are rich oligarchs at the same time. Well known for corruption and abusing EU funds. They are in the red book now, endangered of extinction. They also abuse alchohol and have the dumbest internet trolls on the planet.

Ottomanus Pederastum - known as DPS. Just like GERB, stemming from State Security of People's republic of Bulgaria. Minority/liberal party wannabe but many of them are ethnic Bulgarians. Also known as the ""corporate party"". EXTREME NEPOTISM AND CORRUPTION. They tend to corrupt anything they touch. Known for deliberately creating and destroying a bank monster with 2 billion euro magically disappearing. Can be found in gypsy ghettos and some villages in Southern and North-Eastern Bulgaria. Also in luxury estates around Sofia.

Homo Pseudoreformatorus - a.k.a the Block of Reformists. Wannabe reformists known for spoiling and sabotaging almost all of the reforms they promised and started. They are not a consequence of natural evolution, but rather genetic engineering - introducing democratic genes into ancestors of Homo Bolshevikus. Can be found mostly in hipster places in larger cities.

Psychopatus Putlerastum - known as ATAKA. Mentally challenged freaks, possible cause: excessive incests among some species of Homo Bolshevikus. Known for the idiotic idea to increase the minimum salary to 1000 EUR and for their desire to depart EU and NATO and join the glorious Russian empire. Ex-nationalists, anti-Muslim, anti-Turkish, anti-Jewish, anti-Greek, anti-Serbian, anti-Romanian and anti-Black Sea. But that niche became too small for them and the new incoming players, so they switched priorities and are Putin's prophets nowadays. Noone takes them seriously and they are probably going extinct as well due to inability to reproduce. Can be found in low-life village and small town pubs.

Idiotus Patriotarii - a.k.a the Patriotic Front. Right-wing nationalist wannabes. Known for nothing and good for nothing. Scientists discovered State Security genes in some of them. 


P.S to make things even more interesting, currently we have a coallition of Debilis Milicionerum, Homo Pseudoreformatorus, Idiotus Patriotarii and a breakup of Debilis Nomenclatura. The ""opposition"" is what remained from Debilis Nomenclatura plus Ottomanus Pederastum. But in fact, Idiotus Milicionerum like Ottomanus Pederastum and vice versa so everything is actually about things remaining the same and sabotaging any attempt to reform anything. And they all are sooo afraid of what's happening in Romania that the media propaganda (media mostly controlled by Idiotus Milicionerum and Ottomanus Pederastum) is throwing shit like crazy against it. Even Idiotus Milicionerum's alpha male recently said that Bulgaria will overtake Romania in any possible aspect in six months. Of course his followers that have IQ below 50 believe that crap.

**The coalition government:**

* **Centre Party** (*Suomen Keskusta*) - Currently in power, formed the coalition government with the National Coalition and Finns party. Centrist and liberal economics wise with strong focus and presence in municipalities and rural areas (formerly called the Agrarian League). Often attributed to cronyism, and famous for the slang phrase ""Centre betrays"" (*""Kepu pettää""*). Current Prime Minister is Centre's Juha Sipilä, a Christian centrist with an entrepreneurial background. Laestadians are a huge part of the voter base.

* **National Coalition Party** (*Kansallinen Kokoomus*) - right wing, conservative, ran the former coalition government, very much personified by the former Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen and his dealings with the euro crisis, and currently by the Pepsodent smile Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb. More focused on the national and international scale, a major part in the recent policies driving for social and health care reformation as well as municipal mergers.

* **Finns Party** (*Perussuomalaiset*) - nationalist, leftist and eu-skeptic party with a strong focus on immigration. Recently gained a lot of infamy when a Finns Party MP wrote a ambivalent Facebook update opposing multiculturalism. That lead to a demonstration by 15 000 people. Often called racists by the far-left parties and activists, though most right wing conservatives/nationalists tend to drift apart form them due to leftist economic policies.

**The Opposition**:

* **Social Democratic Party of Finland** (*Sosiaalidemokraattinen puolue, SDP*) - social democrats, old socialists that drifted apart from the more radical left after the Civil War in 1918. Strong connections to the Trade Unions and identifies as a sort of labour party, although major part of voters think they shoot themselves in the foot with their regulation of the job markets. (Full disclosure: IMO they have crippled the job market by legislation that burdens small businesses in that they can't afford to hire anybody which in turn cripples the job market in a national scale. The new coalition strives for localized contracts instead of the collective labor agreement)

* **Green League** (*Vihreä liitto*) - green party that's very leftist in their economic policies, eager to tax the Finnish industry by way of emission taxes and so on. Also home for a few liberalists, but IMO the intellectual wing left for the Pirate Party or others. Originally formed from a collection of environmental activists. More recently made famous by the first ever gay Presidential candidate Pekka Haavisto. Also a strong proponent for multiculturalism and cultural diversity.

* **Left Alliance** (*Vasemmistoliitto*) - socialist party and recently very strong proponent of green policies due to an influx of young members, which drove most of the old school working class socialists/communists to Finns party or communist micro-parties. Youth group has strong connections to anti-fascist organizations and anarchists.

* **Swedish People's Party of Finland** (*Suomen ruotsalainen kansanpuolue*) - a representative of the Finnish Swedes, a minority that's a remnant of the time Finland was a province under Swedish rule that ended in 1809. Their policies and leanings change depending on who is forming the government, but they do have a strong focus on preserving the historical, cultural and lingual heritage of Swedes in Finland (also called svenska talande bättre folk).

* **Christian Democrats of Finland** (*Suomen kristillisdemokraatit*) - Christian conservatives whose leader Päivi Räsänen is famous for driving prohibitionary policies. They are quite lefists in economics, calling for personal and collective responsibility and emphasizing value of human lives in a very Christian manner.

After the relevant one's there are liberal parties, nationalist parties, communist parties, the pirate party and so on.

See the thing is that ""the government"" isn't really being deceitful. I'll try to explain what the situation is as far as I know and I'm not super informed about this. 

The removal of the statues issue has been very drawn out. The actual government has proposed the removal several times now I think but it always got rejected by like the ministry of culture or something which is also part of the government but they're not actively responsible for creating laws and such so it's kind of separate. 

The refusal is on the grounds that it's part of history. Whatever that means. So apparently the symbolism and a reminder of an oppressive regime is all cool even though soviet symbolism is banned in Lithuania except in museums and stuff. So the people who are responsible for refusing to take down the statues are using the ""it's part of history"" argument but not really going in depth about it or at least I've not heard anything beyond that.

To my knowledge the majority of people want the statues gone and the only argument they have for keeping it is mostly parroting that it is part of history but that usually gets sidelined by the fact that the creator of the statues was a well respected Lithuanian sculptor who died around the time the government proposed to remove the statues the last time it came up. So out of respect for the sculptor people got all emotional for no reason and started whining. IMO the biggest argument that the people have that it's a creation of a Lithuanian but then the debates don't really go anywhere just like with the ""part of history"" argument. So honestly, the loudest people about this issue are just being loud for the sake of being loud and the people who could go either way don't really care and then the people who are left and who are the majority (that's my personal perception) want them gone but the ministry of culture (??) keeps blocking it. 

Oh, and I heard something that the head of the ministry of culture (??) is a Russian government sympathizer, but that's anecdotal even though if I recall correctly his name was pretty much russian so there's that. 

As far as the current removal is concerned. They HAD TO be removed because of critical conditions. The current mayor was a lawyer or something and I wouldn't put it beyond him that he pretty much found a loophole on how to bypass the ministry of culture(?). 

Apparently there were a bunch of talks about renovating without removal but because the conditions were critical they just had to remove the statues and the mayor is openly against the statues going back up so he's like ""yeah... we're on a tight budget so the statue thing isn't really a priority right now"". I don't think they will go back up or even get restored. A few museums/parks offered to take them already.

Lastly, as far as the deceitful part goes. The only thing that was being protected was the removal of the statues but now since they are removed the city can do whatever they want especially since the protected status is about to get canceled in Autumn I think and the Mayor is just waiting it out for now.",null,0,null,1438204798,null,0,1438205587,0,ctkrwh7,null,t3_3f0wfl,null,t1_ctkrwh7,null,t1_ctkp3ne,null,null,null,1440165187,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

They won't do that and attempt an annexation like in Crimea, either, because the Indian Army is strong enough to repel that, and any further escalation risks nuclear weapons detonating over Islamabad.

Ukraine had the second part of the puzzle in place as a deterrent against something like Crimea, and gave that up.

Supposedly Merkel relies heavily on telephone polls when she has to find a political stance. In the left spectrum she is considered to be a calculating and opportunist flip-flopper. In her rise to power she has eviscerated opposition in her party and there is some doubt whether there is a designated successor after Merkel is gone.  With the weakness of the SPD there can be no doubt who will win the next elections. Both the CDU and CSU have been at the center of massive corruption scandals in the past ([A big donation scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDU_donations_scandal), [Lockheed bribery scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_bribery_scandals), and plenty more).

On the federal level center-right, in some states (Bavaria, Baden-Würtemberg) right wing. More concerned with maintaining the status quo (or at least the appearance of it)

Pro: Privatization, lower taxes for the rich and companies, mass surveillance. 

Anti: Immigration (mostly on the state level), equality for GSM, Drug Law liberalization, renewable energy (mostly on the state level, but very unenthusiastic about change in the energy sector), environmentalism







+ **SPD** : Center party, purports to be leftist.  Some part of the divided german left consider them traitorous, especially since the early 2000s, when a SPD/Greens coalition introduced the ""Agenda 2010"", which made deep cuts to benefits and welfare. The SPD has shrunk from ~35% election results in the 90s to ~25% in the last two elections and lost about 450000 of their 900000 members since 1990. They have no chance of getting out of that misery if they don't return to their former leftist positions or find another way to clearly distinguish themselves from the CDU (currently they are nearly a carbon copy of it). The SPD has been in coalitions with the greens, but their share of seats would not be enough to from a government today. Forming a broad leftist coalition with the Greens and Die Linke could be one way out, but the SPD categorically refuses to form a coalition with Die Linke, supposedly because the SPD sees Die Linke as the successor organization of the SED (dictatorial Party in the GDR). I think the SPD doesn't want to legitimize Die Linke, because they fear losing votes (ignoring that this is already the case). 

Possible Differences between the CDU and SPD:

Look at the economic policies of the republicans an you have the party platform of the FDP. All other parts of the party program are better thought of as poker chips for coalition talks. The FDP was kicked out of the parliament in the last elections and currently below the 5% hurdle in the polls.

+ **Die Linke**: Far left. Split internally between the western and eastern parts of the party. The eastern part of the party is somewhat stuck in hopeless leftist idealism and anti-american / pro-russian idiocy. The western part of the party brings up painful subjects that the other parties would rather like to ignore.

null,false,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,null,"&gt; Then it's a lot more politically acceptable to make up a story about how we need to throw some money at those morally bankrupt Southerners to protect ourselves from contagion than it is to admit that your own regulators failed miserably and that you'll need to rack up debt to bail out a bunch of reckless bankers.

Except that it *isn't* politically easier, which is demonstrable fact. Germany bailed out its banks to the tune of €295 billion, without any major political fuss at all - you probably can't even recall them doing it. The road to even lending money to Greece in the first place was politically difficult in Germany, and has become a huge political issue since - also a demonstrable fact.

Bailing out national banks has been politically much easier than bailing out Greece, and bailing out one's banks via Greece is both politically and financially extremely difficult. The German public sees the sense in bailing out Sachsen Landesbank or Hypo (although both of those were failures of the Irish regulator, not the German one), but it is visibly and on-the-record *not* interested in bailing out 'profligate Southerners'. Given the huge political backlash against doing so in Germany, and the *publicity* the unpopularity of bailing out Greece has been given, it's hard to see how you can possibly believe it's an easy option without injecting a large amount of your own prejudices.

I would say that you believe that Germany might want to bail out its banks through Greece because *you* dislike bank bailouts, so it seems to you likely that a government would try to hide them. But no government *has* tried to hide them - on the contrary, they've publicly, openly, and repeatedly stated their support for 'their' banks. Bailing out banks has been done by every government when it was seen as needed, and the governments have together issued declarations and decisions supporting the banks. Support for Greece, on the contrary, has been very difficult and contentious - but you think bailing out Greece is *right*. 

Out of those two biases/prejudices, you construct a story which has Germany doing what is (to you) wrong - bailing out its banks - and hiding it under cover of doing something (to you) right - bailing out Greece. But that's completely at odds with *all* the facts, and is basically a fact-free moral fantasy on your part. 

The belief that Germany (et al) was really bailing out its own banks when it was bailing out crisis countries is a popular one in crisis countries. It's unrelated to facts, and has a simple psychological mechanism. Gratitude is one of the most difficult emotions for people.

So... Ok. The elections that are coming up are *different*, as in they are mostly plebiscitary (except if you ask PP, who'll say they are normal autonomic elections).

As such, the parties this time are... different than from the last autonomic elections. So let's take a look at both.

Also, I'll just mention the parties that have at least one parliament seat, because there are a few more that haven't got any (the most known one being PxC, a xenophobic right-wing party).

## Last elections (in order of parliament seats)

- Convergència i Unió (CiU) - It was a federation between two parties: Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya (CDC) and Unió Democràtica de Catalunya (UDC). Convergència is a liberal, centre-right party in favour of Independence. Unió is a christian democratic party against Independence.

- Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) - It's a left-wing, republican, very pro-independence party.

- Partit Socialista de Catalunya (PSC) - It's the catalan PSOE (PSOE is one of the two major spanish parties). They are left-wing and socialist democratics. (in theory). Also against independence. Their popularity has fallen a lot these past years, mostly because of the independence thing but also because the party is just a shadow of its former self. It has become less left-wing and less social-democratic. Lots of important members left.

- Partit Popular (PP) - It's the catalan PP (PP is the other major spanish party, the one that's currently ruling in absolute majority). Right-wing, very against independence, conservative, etc.

- ICV-EUiA - Federation between ICV (the Greens, everyone seems to have them so no need to explain) and EUiA (left-wing, anti-capitalist, pro-feminism, etc.). Their Independentist position dances a bit, sometimes they said yes, sometimes no. They are at least in favour of letting the citizens decide through a referendum.

- Ciutadans (C's) - Those are a bit strange. They started out saying they were centre-left, in favour of the population, etc. - turns out they are as right-wing as PP, albeit a bit more populist. They are relatively new (around 10 years). Also against Independence.

- Candidatura d'Unitat Popular (CUP) - Very left-wing, independentists, socialists, green, feminists. They run their party through direct democracy, allowing all militants to vote their decisions instead of the rulers of the party making them. Very popular among the young people (well, the young people who also are left-wing and pro-independence, of course).

## Next elections

I'll just note the differences, what changed and their position about independence. Their descriptions are above.

I grouped those first on their independence position (Yes, No and Undefined) and then on their current number of seats.

- Junts pel Sí (JxSí) - A coalition between Convergència (CDC) and Esquerra Republicana (ERC). Also some smaller parties like Demòcrates de Catalunya (DC) and Moviment d'Esquerres (MES). With other parties giving them their support. And a lot of members from civil organisations, such as ANC (they organise the huge demonstrations each year you've probably heard of), Òmnium Cultural, and some popular figures such as Lluís Llach (singer) or Pep Guardiola (former Barça trainer). They're basically the coalition that's in favour of Independence.

- CUP - The other party that's also in favor of independence and not in JxSí. They couldn't agree on some terms, so both will run together.

- PSC - They run again, in clear favour of the No. They claim we have to work with Spain in order to get what we need.

- PP - They don't even say we're having a plebiscitarian elections, but voting them is a clear No.

- C's - They do agree it's a plebiscitarian elections, also in favour of the  No.

- UDC - Do you remember the other half of CiU? They split off, and they're running as well. They are against Independence.

- CSQEP (Catalunya Sí que es Pot) - New party. Even if that Sí (Yes) would make you think their pro-independence, they're not. I'm sure you've heard of Podemos in Spain. They're pretty much Podemos that have formed a coalition with ICV-EUiA. While they're not pro-independence, they're not against it either. They claim we have the right to decide if we want it, but only through legal means and only if Spain will let us. (that'd make sense if PP was not in power in Spain...).

---

So... that's pretty much it, I guess. If you have any questions, do ask! I tried to make it as impartial as possible, but I'm sure there's a bit of bias there.

Just to disclose, I've voted ERC in the past and will probably vote JxSí, even if I'm torn between them and CUP.

Windows 10 per ora non ti conviene installarlo la maggior parte delle cose funziona ma qualche problemino alcuni programmi/giochi lo hanno ancora...inoltre c'è qualche indiscrezione del fatto che mandi un po' troppe informazioni a Microsoft...

Windows 8/8.1 per quanto sia più veloce di seven MI fa pena a livello di interfaccia, ti consiglio un installazione di Windows 7 che al momento supporta il 99% di giochi e programmi(dannato Fallout 3) senza alcun tipo di problema e ha un interfaccia per PC e non per tablet. Anyway controlla in caso che siano disponibili tutti i driver per il tuo pc.

Detto questo, office, photoshop e robe del genere se li hai acquistati devi trovarti il codice e in caso capire come trasferire la licenza, se invece sono (come immagino) ""acquistati"" allora formatta tutto direttamente che tanto poi li puoi ""riacquistare"" e almeno hai le ultime versioni e non ti porti dietro virus o simili.

Per i file, salvateli su una chiavetta, facci una scansione e se sono puliti li rimetti dopo che hai formattato altrimenti se ti porti dietro schifezze rendi tutto inutile.

Per quanto riguarda la formattazione credo sia una cosa molto semplice, scarichi la ISO di windows, la masterizzi, riavvii il pc e con un tasto che cambia in base alla scheda madre(di solito appare durante l'avvio del pc) fai in modo che il computer non carichi il sistema da Hard disk ma da cd...a quel punto appare una procedura guidata molto semplice da seguire(ci sono molti video su YT in caso) da cui volendo puoi anche creare le due partizioni...

Evita le partizioni se non strettamente necessario, piuttosto insegna a tuo fratello a usare il pc, STEAM e a installare programmi deselezionando le *fottute* spunte degli adware.

Detto questo, se vuoi un pc ordinato una volta installato windows le prime cose da fare sono: 

attivarlo-&gt;installare driver-&gt;intallare chrome-&gt;installare adblock(non tanto per le pubblicità che servono a supportare il lavoro delle persone quanto per i ""clicca qui ipad gratis"" su cui magari tuo fratello potrebbe accidentalmente cliccare)-&gt;installare antivirus-&gt;aggiornare windows-&gt;Installare i tuoi programmi

Bonus pro tips:

Disattivare le funzioni inutili(internet explorer, gadget di windows).
Evitare programmi tipo ccleaner et similiar(da windows 95 fanno solo casino).
Antivirus a pagamento sono inutili(AVG free o avira vanno benissimo).

In all cases compensation is awarded for companies under national laws, and applicable to foreign and domestic companies, as well as private individuals. TTIP changes nothing in that regard.

[l.e.] Contrary to popular belief, the reason why we have elected politicians in a democracy is not because ""we want somebody popular in power"" but because we need to have someone govern us. It is implied that the governments should act in the interest of the people, and indeed many laws try to formalise this requirement.

A valid reason to seek an elected position is ""to be able to push policies that you believe would be for the benefit of the population"".  Seeking an elected position just ""to get popularity, and thus money and power"" is not something that is or should be encouraged by law. Yes, politicians do that - but they don't do it because ""it's normal"", they do it because they can (i.e. it's very hard to prove bad intention, they can simply claim ""millions of people believed this to be the right thing, of course I believed it, too!

L'autore si rivolge di nuovo a un qualche Illustrissimo, che presumo sia l'uomo chiamato a fare da giudice nella questione. Nell'ultima pagina, c'è una nota rapida, in grafia più umana, scritta da Cortega e risalente al 1773, che sostiene che i Berlochi e G.Verenti hanno raggiunto un accordo, spartitisi una casa secondo una dote e si dichiarono soddisfatti.

You will need 2 professional figures:  
  
- A calligrapher, to understand and transcribe what is written on those sheets of paper.  
  
- A linguist, because that is not italian as we know it, it is some transition between vulgar italian and italian (people in 1600 were still using latin as the institutional langage, although vulgar was spoken by the people. it was in the first half of 1700 that latin was declared officially dead and ""italian"" was still in ""developement"". In 1800 we had the very first italian dictionaries, drawing a line on what was correct/official italian and what was not.)  
  
Then you can come here and we will translate that for you.

For some reason Stiglitz fails to mention that, nor does he elaborate on the reasons for the price discrepancy. Here's some background by Reuters 2012: [Price of milk makes Greeks' blood boil](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/22/us-economy-greece-milk-idUSBRE8AL0OD20121122)

So when Stiglitz writes:
&gt; Greeks enjoy their fresh milk, produced locally and delivered quickly.

One could translate it into:
&gt; Greeks enjoy their ~~fresh~~ misleadingly labeled most expensive in the EU milk, 

Milk is fresh when it comes out of cow's tit. But after that it's pasteurized and homogenized, and it becomes processed milk. It's not fresh milk any more, and labeling it as such is misleading. And the restriction of a maximum five days shelf life does not turn it back into fresh. Five days old milk is five days old milk, not fresh. All that does is more milk gets thrown away, and the milk prices remain artificially higher than they should be.

&gt; produced locally 

Produced in small farms, some too small to even grow their own fodder which is bought from somewhere else or even imported. As a result the average farm-gate price they get for their milk is among the highest in the EU but even then the producer margins are small.

&gt; and delivered quickly.

Depends on the definition of 'quickly'. Milk costs more on the islands where it's much slower to transport it. And the shelf life of only five days means more trips to the farms everywhere, and therefore more transportation costs which gets added to the price.

Yet for some reason to Stiglitz Greece dropping the misleading label 'fresh' is a travesty. Never mind that Greece agreed to do that already in 2012 but has failed to adhere to its commitments.",null,0,null,1438207097,null,0,false,0,ctktgqj,null,t3_3f0qem,null,t1_ctktgqj,null,t1_ctk652e,null,null,null,1440165925,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

&gt; Legal? It is the state that decides what is legal when the dispute is decided at internal level. 

In our constitution there is a paragraph that dictates that expropriation cannot happen without compensation. It would take a lot to change that. That also means that in case you feel this happens illegally you would eligible to sue in front of the constitutional court (and likely win for that matter). No ISDS necessary.

&gt;Why are we talking about risk when actually this is about breaching obligations?

It was you who argued for safe enviroments, implying that those without ISDS in place are not. So it is about the risk (see what I did there) of a nation breaching its obligations (whatever they may be). I understand that corporations want security, but they should not get it selectively since if in my mind violates the principle of equality before the law. If local business do not get that, so shouldn't international. They share the same burden.

&gt;How many times do I have to say it, Jesus on a bycicle!!!!

Until you realize that there is a ""seperation of powers"" and constitutions which protect private property in place within first world nation and that these nations do not arbitrarily take someones stuff! You whole case rests on that argument and its wholy unrealistic when it comes to first world entities. But this isn't going into your thick skull, ain't it? If you are so afraid of changing regulations and foreign courts not giving you a fair traily THEN DON'T FUCKING INVEST THERE! IT IS THAT FUCKING EASY! 

But this is not why ISDS is demanded by the corporations, not anymore anyway.

&gt;But what if even the Constitution is changed?

And you think this will happend in a cloak and dagger fashion with no prior notice? In nations who may mandate 2/3th or 3/4th majorites in one or more chambers? Any corporation getting caught cold kinda desevers at as punishment for gross neglect. And if Hungary has that luxury to change all laws, then I would start to divest because apprently there mere possibility alone should be treated as a certainty.

Also, I used the phillip morris stuff as an easy to understand example of ISDS abuse, but since you brought up south american examples, I'll give another one, Argentinia.

They privatized their public services in the 90's and this led to a hike in price (double to tripple according to some sources) for water (and other necessities). When they mandated a price cap to aid their impoverished people, guess what happened..

I'll tell you, a flood of ISDS claims. Many of which they lost and led to exorbitant paydays for the mostly american corporations involved. No surprise that *american* law firms (because ""best of the best"") involved with the ICSID (HQ in *America*) ruled in favour of *american* corporations and not the suffering people of Argentinia who now have not only shitty municipal services and have to shoulder ISDS payments. So much for neutrality, eh?

And this is far from the only [example](http://www.elstel.org/ISDS.html.en) where people have to suffer for the benefit corporations and their law firm minions. But fuck people in need, if their govt.  actually acts in their interest, so mega corps can continue to line their pockets, am I right?

And I bet my ass, these american law firms are just waiting for TTIP to become active and sue the living shit out of european nations. You should be afraind, very afraid. Or not, since you are lawyer, maybe you are hoping to win it big and get onto one of these shadow courts some day. Neutrality, my ass.

&gt;You don't get to be part of an ICSID panel [paragraph].

Appeal to authority. I ain't buying that. Whether these judges are competent doesn't matter if ISDS is used as an instrument to bully legislations into submission and extort money out of nations where the people is in dire need, the threat alone is often sufficient to disincentivise law making, again: chilling effect. Read up what that is, because I get the impression that you don't.

It also says absolutely nothing about their impartiality. In fact, an impartial lawyer wouldbe a liability to himself and to his clients, so why should he become impartial once he struck gold and got on the shortlist of an ISDS court?

&gt;If you have an awards it means that, in the future, should there be a change of regime and the former rogue country wants to start observing international law again, changes are they may pay.

Signing BITs with ISDS is not a sign of a nation recovering, see Russia.

&gt;Diplomatic protection exists as a possiblity but it is very impracticle. 

I have rather something inpractical that does not undermine democracy and sovereingity than efficient shadow courts who do just that. Democracy as a whole is not efficient. Show me an efficiently run nation and I show a totalitarian dictatorship.

&gt;This offers no solution at all. Just look at how well diplomacy has worked in the past decades in Palestine.

Because a long-running territorial/religious dispute is totally the same as a minor hick-up when nation enacts new regulations, am I right? Remind me which one of us intellectually dishones again.

&gt;Also, since you value diplomacy so much, you do realize that it is through a diplomatic process that a BIT is concluded in the first place, don't you? 

And there isn't anything wrong with that.

&gt;But what's the point of ever having an agreement if it cannot be enforced.

How exactly are ISDS rulings enforces anyway, if a nation says ""Yeah, fuck those!""?
Sanctions? Those can be declared unilaterally anyway, so why ISDS?

&gt;If you want a world in which 1) there is foreign investment and 2) parties involved behave in accordance with the obligations they undertook, ISDS is the best option. 

I want a world where 1) sovereignity of nations (and their peoples) and their ability to enact laws as they see fit is universally respected and 2) these nation's legislative bodies are not bullied into submission by international corporations and their shadow courts.

If one side fails to uphold its end of the barging there are a plethora of diplomatic and economic instruments from talking sternly to the offending nation's ambassador to sanctions to hard power. Administrations who enact sanctions can be voted out of office just as easily administrations whose regulations led to people losing their jobs because the investor didn't like them. Please tell me who can vote the judges of an ISDS court out of office? Is there even some sort of appalation court?

&gt;It is intellectually dishonest of you to dismiss what I said without making the effort to read about such awards or read one of the awards.

Without Moscow those nukes would not have worked at all.

The other reason is because Ukraine was a basketcase in the '90s and still is in many ways. They have proven consistently that the decision to force them to give up the nukes was right. Ukrainians having been selling stuff left behind by the USSR left, right and centre even when it was against international laws. Somali Pirates captured 33 Ukrainian T-72 tanks that were sold to South Sudan at a time when it was under a UN arms embargo. Right now those tanks are probably being used in the civil war that involves massive human rights violations, the murder of patients in hospitals and ethnic cleansing on a huge scale.

This was also a country caught selling anti-air equipment to Saddam at a time when even his Arab neighbours avoided him with a ten foot pole. They also sold a Soviet carrier to the Chinese with engines that were beyond the capabilities of China. The country was desperate and they made money living off what the USSR left behind.

Imagine a Ukraine with nukes going through the 90s and early 2000s.

null,false,JeSuisSuedois,SWED,Sweden,null,"Doing this by percentage in the 2014 election:

**Socialdemokraterna (S) (Social Democratic Party)** - 31%

The historical giants of Swedish politics, historically so successful that Sweden virtually functioned as a single-party state for much of the 20th century. Very closely linked with [LO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Trade_Union_Confederation), a confederation of blue-collar trade unions, their dominance has fallen in the post-industrial era but they remain Sweden's largest party. Like most large European Social Democratic parties they are a centre-left party today. Pro-EU.

**Moderaterna (M) (Moderate Party)** 23.3%

The traditional arch-nemesis of the Social Democrats, a historically conservative party that has become increasingly liberal over time, particularly during the Reinfeldt years. In 2015 it would be difficult for an outside observer to decide if the party is liberal conservative or conservative liberal, it might even be labelled as a social liberal party. Either way the centrist shift was successful for the party, sometimes placing ahead of the Social Democrats in opinion polls and producing their best election results in almost a century but they have struggled in opinion polls since the election. Pro-EU.

**Sverigedemokraterna (SD) (Sweden Democrats)** 12.9%

Once formed out of the white nationalist [Bevara Sverige Svenskt-movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevara_Sverige_Svenskt) the party has gone through several changes over the years in an effort to become a serious, accepted political party. While they have historically referred to themselves as nationalists, they have begun styling themselves as *socially conservative* in more recent times, though in practice they are effectively a single-issue anti-immigration party, primarily attracting voters dissatisfied with the immigration policy pursued by the other Riksdag parties. Anti-EU.

**Miljöpartiet de Gröna (MP) (Green Party)** 6.9%

A generally left-leaning and softly Eurosceptic Green party, popular with young, urban voters.

**Centerpartiet (C) (Centre Party)** 6.1%

An agrarian and liberal party, they are strong proponents of decentralisation and the interests of Swedish farmers. Traditionally the strongest in rural areas, but in recent years they have made an effort to attract both right-leaning green voters and libertarians from urban areas. Centrist on social issues, but furthest to the right along with the Liberal People's Party on economic issues. Mostly pro-EU.

**Vänsterpartiet (V) (The Left Party)** 5.7%

Once the Swedish Communist party, they are a democratic socialist party today. Furthest to the left of all the Riksdag parties, they advocate feminism, a larger public sector, higher taxes and oppose privatisations. Anti-EU.

**Folkpartiet Liberalerna (FP) (Liberal People's Party)** 5.4%

A mostly social liberal party, though it has a sizeable conservative liberal faction within the party. The most internationalist party in the Riksdag, FP are strong supporters of free trade, the free market, the EU and have advocated for Swedish NATO membership for decades. The party also distinguish themselves by being the strongest supporters of both nuclear power and the armed forces in the Riksdag. Socially and economically liberal, the party is centrist on social issues and on the right along with the Centre Party on economic issues relative to the other Riksdag parties. Typically stronger in urban areas than in the countryside. Very pro-EU.

**Kristdemokraterna (KD) (Christian Democrats)** 4.6%

Socially conservative by Swedish standards but almost socially liberal compared to foreign Christian Democratic parties, the Christian Democrats traditionally draw their support from the pentecostals and free churches and are usually the smallest party in the Riksdag. Centre-right both economically and socially.

&gt;SYRIZA, by accepting austerity and not having us leave the EU isn't as much doing what they believe in (which would define them as an ""pro-austerity party"") but rather what they must do in order to stay in the EU.

Samaras and New Democracy by accepting austerity didn't do what they liked (cut taxes, increase pensions and let the ""fiscal multiplier"" provide explosive growth to the economy, this was their plan as they outlined it numerous times before the 2012 elections) but rather what they had to do to keep the country in the eurozone.

null,false,wadcann,UNSA,United States of America,null,"I think that for most people, a from-first-principles argument is more-interesting than the current law (though certainly law *is* relevant).

So, I don't want to put words in anyone's mouth, but here is my guess, extrapolating from what I've seen in the past, as to why anti-immigration people would be upset about illegal immigration from poor states in Africa:

* There's a concern about competing religions.  I think that in many societies, people are concerned about the idea of the society's norms shifting due to outsiders coming in.

* There's a concern about crime.  It's true that if you have poor, desperate people outside the system, that there might be a risk of crime, perhaps violent crime.  That being said, in the United States, illegal immigrants actually exhibit a [substantially lower-than-normal](http://openborders.info/hispanic-crime-and-illegal-immigration-in-the-united-states/) crime rate; this was somewhat surprising to me, especially given that I'd seen a number of people concerned about the risk of burglary or robbery.

* There's a concern about competition for limited welfare spending.  Whether you're on the welfare system or are simply worried about the consequences of it being exhausted or the consequences of having to pay more into it yourself, that's a realistic worry.  And I think that there *is* something to this -- the understanding I have is that non-EU immigration is a net negative to EU countries when it comes to welfare spending.

* There's a concern about competition for unskilled labor slots.  This also seems real -- technological and social changes have tended to squeeze unskilled labor, and the idea of a great number of people coming in in who are willing to work for very little is terribly-alarming.  I should also note that in the United States, this was a major issue driving opposition to abolition even in the North -- the idea that it would unload a massive amount of competition for job slots into the labor market.

* There are concerns about racial issues -- that is, Africa is poor, and a number of other areas and groups peopled by black Africans are also poor and/or have problems.  If many people immigrated from Africa, would this also bring problems with it to European countries?  I get the feeling that I don't have much insight into how much of a concern this actually is, because discussion here is a social taboo -- however, obviously some of the people who are upset about immigration do also have racial concerns.  I've seen people have pointed out that some of Africa's issues are due to colonialism, and that controlling for that is important; some people like Jared Diamond would talk about lack of megafauna, soil quality in Africa, or some other issues.  Certainly Egypt or Zimbabwe had substantial civilization achievements in long-past times; on the other hand, Africa also hasn't been very competitive in modern times, even pre-dating the colonial era.  I think that there's a tendency to over-weight issues here, but on the other hand, I also think that it's pretty tough to just discount this as a concern.  It's also very sensitive to talk about -- after all, if we all came to consensus that race was an important input into, say, inventing new things, how is this to be addressed?  There are political reasons both on the political left and right that treat humans as things that can be treated as interchangeable via race, and this would conflict with a number of important policies that have been adopted.  On the left, this might be the view that hiring quotas are justified because a disparity in demographics here is necessarily due to bias and non-meritocratic.  On the right, this might be that a lack of equality-of-outcome in society is the fault of the individual's decisions, and thus society need take no responsibility on egalitarian grounds to ""flatten out"" society.

    I think that there are good arguments that could be developed here in favor of immigration.  Some of the concerns here seem to be obsolete.  Before we developed an understanding of DNA, people tended to think that intermarriage between races simply ""blended"" characteristics -- a four-foot person marrying a six-foot person would tend to produce a five foot person.  If so, it would be very difficult for a sole positive mutation to ever propagate, and it was one of the major objections to Darwin's ideas.  This understanding was what drove the creation of anti-miscegenation laws, since if it were correct, any intermarriage with some race that had less-than-desirable characteristics would tend to permanently ""taint"" one's offspring, to lose some of those positive characteristics forever.  A greater understanding of genetics helped eliminate the concerns here -- sure, it might take a while for evolutionary pressure to do so, but any positive characteristic that gets inserted into the gene pool will tend to dominate in the long run.  In fact, expanding the pool tends to provide access to a larger pool of positive genetic characteristics: for example, there are independent mutations providing malaria resistance in India and Africa, and there are HIV resistant genes.  A larger genetic pool just means a larger genetic pool for nature to find and pick positive traits from: East Asians have a better ability to sink heat due to a higher sweat gland density, Caucasians enjoy adult lactose tolerance, Africans enjoy malaria resistance.  Mix them together, and in the long run, you tend to wind up with the good stuff.

* There are concerns about the fact that illegal immigration is favoring people who ""break the rules"".  Honestly, I've not seen this raised much, but it certainly is something that rubs me the wrong way.  If someone follows the immigration rules, they tend to be somewhat screwed as to a chance to immigrate; if someone breaks the rules, they are rewarded for it.  That seems unjust, somehow.  If the goal is to permit immigration, I'd rather see that immigration done legally than illegally.  On the *other* hand, politically, raising immigration levels may be very difficult, so objecting to the illegal nature might also be a way of simply deflecting arguments about immigration.

That seems like the sort of thing that would be more-interesting to discuss: these are concrete benefits or costs, not just things that are a minor quirk of the particular policy being adopted, and something that you could find many people agreeing on the benefits or costs of.",null,0,null,1438208195,null,0,false,0,ctku6ni,null,t3_3ewn1j,null,t1_ctku6ni,null,t1_ctk2kih,null,null,null,1440166328,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

No because that wasn't what they were trying to do. Samaras and ND actively supported an austerity deal with the EU with a few alterations. That's very different from the way more radical stance of SYRIZA for a complete redrafting and extensive debt relief.

Come on, are we gonna go on circles on the same thing?

&gt;Samaras and New Democracy by accepting austerity didn't do what they likeδ (cut taxes, increase pensions and let the ""fiscal multiplier"" provide explosive growth to the economy, this was their plan as they outlined it numerous times before the 2012 elections) but rather what they had to do to keep the country in the eurozone.

Samaras and ND, as with everyone (including me) don't ""like"" to cut pensions and social security. They want to implement the , in their opinion, needed austerity though, as a central political goal. That includes cutting pensions and social security.

Also, did you read the article? He specifically said he didn't want to implement *new* taxes.

He also says

&gt;Στο εκλογικό σώμα, μίλησε με συγκεκριμένα μέτρα για την περικοπή της σπάταλης στο δημόσιο

He specifically wanted to further cut down on the public sector, which is austerity.

Disclaimer: Sorry if it's a little biased or inaccurate, I welcome any corrections.

Left Block: Radical leftists, anti-austerity, for full nationalization of the banks, for LGBT rights. Similar to Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain (except for the popularity).

Communist Party (PCP): Communists, anti-austerity, anti-Euro, convervatives. Third biggest party, but was never in government because they get their power from their close ties with the unions.

Green Party: Environmentalists. Social democrats, pro-LGBT rights, but obviously with a focus on the environment.

PS: Center-left social democrats. Main opposition party who's been in and out of government since 1975. They want to ""end austerity while still respecting the rules of the EU"" which just means a lighter austerity. They are pro-EU, pro-Euro, socially progressive (party that made gay marriage legal).

PSD: Center-right neoliberals. Current ruling party. They are for austerity (although they have to hide it somewhat), pro-EU, pro-Euro, and range from conservatives to social liberals, but they mainly lean conservative (on social issues, each MP votes on their own, there is no party line).

CDP-PP: Right-wing party. Often in government as a coalition partner (like right now). Conservatives. PSD's little brother, some call them. They often try to portray themselves as centrists (last year, they pushed for and got passed new taxes on plastic bags and other things to help the environment).

There are also many other parties, but they are too small to get a seat in parliament. They are mostly left-wing parties, and the reason why the left is so divided in Portugal, and why the Left Bloc has lost its popularity (they used to be the 3rd largest party, ahead of PCP and CDP-PP, but now they've lost it)

It is true that Ukraine sold a lot of arments but nukes are not your typical goods.

Secondly yes switches were in moskow but to detonate nuke you don't need those because you can retrofit nukes, fuel and so on. You can make even dirty bombs which would be a lot more effective in prevension than handing over nukes.

Finally. NO ONE COULD GET THOSE NUKES without ukraine itself trying to suck up to major powers. If ukraine wouldn't let those nukes no one would dare to take them from them.

null,false,Arathian,GREE,Fuck the EU.,null,"&gt;I've seen about as much actual discussion in this thread as I have in all the various submissions of the past few months.

Look. I understand you guys get lots of people yelling at you and the original thread had a sizable brigade from our ""sister-who-we-are-not-really-talking-to-since-she-put-a-nazi-flag-in-the-garden sub"" however, don't you realise with this that, what you are essentially saying is, that you haven't seen much discussion *you* cared about/liked in the past few months?

There is an easy and quick fix for that and it is generally not checking the threads, which is absolutely fine. Filters would also work.

Currently, european newspaper front-page issues are not being discussed in this sub at all. How is that a success in any way? To whom is the front page ""nicer"" to? Obviously not the users considering the constant backlass towards the containment threads.

&gt;The point of this thread was to give some place for immigration to be discussed, as much as it ever was truly discussed, whilst allowing discussion of other topics to flourish as well. It seems to be working very effectively in that effect.

As people have pointed out much better than me in the past few threads:

Megathreads don't work like that. Stickies have the amazing feature of generally getting less discussion than normal threads since they are usually reserved for announcements. When I was a forum mod in the past it was common knowledge that stickying something was the surest way to kill discussion in it. I assume you know that too. 

This system also has a ton of problems inherent to reddit. Discussions, even good ones, are burried in reddit due to the way comments are presented and are generally best for 2-3 people. If that was not the case, why even allow multiple threads in this sub and not have a megasticky with the top stories posted every day?

&gt;If you want to discuss immigration more without megthreads, then I invite you to go to /r/Euromigration , which will be more to your desires.

Again, why not make a /r/europerussia too and send everyone who wants to talk about Rusisa there? A /r/europegreece and send everyone talking about the crisis there? Why is this discussion different than those? What was the reasoning behind this besides ""we didn't like the discussion going on""?

The NPD is the last surviving nationalist party in Germany. All others have either been outlawed or desintegrated due to internal struggles. The NPD seems to face the same fate at the moment, but when the last attempt was made to outlaw the NPD, it came to light that so many people in the NPD were agents of one of one of our secret services that nobody could tell what was genuine NPD agenda and what was provocation seeded by the agents to trick party members into illegal behaviour.

How ironically. 

&gt;Economically they aren't really sure where to stand, somewhat centre-left.

The Greens are generally pro-higher taxes and often promote this in their election campaigns. They have the richest voterbase in Germany, but which has no problem to pay more for a state which promots ecology or a more caring state. 

I think it is also ironic that you mention the NPD and AFD and not the more important liberal FDP, which I think is more important (although the FDP didnt manage to pass the 5% barrier last time). The FDP is also for the political history of German Federal Republic important, since they were part of many governments. 

&gt;NPD - Neonazi party whose leadership are government agents

Most agents had to withdraw after the German Secreat Service (I think it is called BND) accidentally financed a neo-nazi terrorist cell in Germany which killed eight Turks, one police officer and one Greek (why did they shoot a Greek?) and robbed several banks. The party lost many members since that and will most likley only stay alive in remote areas of Germany, where the local Germans have no perspectives.  (BTW why did the German state finance neo-nazi groups anyway? A German wrote to me once that they only did this so that the mainstream politians stayed in a better light).",null,0,null,1438210014,null,0,1438210273,0,ctkvbh7,null,t3_3f1u3r,null,t1_ctkvbh7,null,t1_ctkpy0c,null,null,null,1440166864,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

I'll just describe the parties that have seats in the parliament, the others are barely relevant.

**Tėvynės sąjunga - LKD** -- conservatives.  Religious, socially conservative, pro business, quite nationalist, anti-communist, anti-russian.  An old, established political force with a dedicated voter base.

**LSDP** -- social democrats by name.  Former communists by nature.  Home to some shocking remnants from the soviet regime.  Cronyist in governance style. Often pandering to the poorest demographic.  Often socially conservative, despite the title.

**Darbo partija / Labour**.  Got most seats during the last election.  A party organized and held together by a successful ethnic Russian businessman.  The party and its leadership is practically implicated in financial fraud, court cases dragging on for almost a decade.  No particular political or economical ideology.  Driven just by populism and the leader's charisma. UPD: causes vote buying suspicions every damn time.

**Liberalų sąjūdis / liberals** -- mostly young, bright people with a lot of common sense and a bit too much free market neocon ideology.  Cleanest reputation.

**Drąsos kelias** -- opportunist clowns who managed to rally some loonie following around a notorious polarizing criminal case and squeezed over the minimum limit.  The leader is in the hiding, being sought by the law enforcement on said case.

**Tvarka ir teisingumas / Order and justice** -- pathetic populists employing too many nazi allusions in their PR.  Spineless centrists despite that.  The leader is the only impeached president in Europe.  He's fighting his ban from elected positions in the court of human rights.

**Lietuvos lenkų rinkimų akcija / The Polish electoral campaign** -- the representatives of the Polish ethnic minority in the Vilnius region.  In order to remain relevant, they escalate ethnic friction instead of helping the minorities.  The leader seems to align himself with Putin's Russia more than with Poland.  A permanent fixture in the parliament, sometimes part of the coalition.

&gt; After the law went into effect, the Spanish Association of Publishers of Periodical Publications (AEEPP) commissioned an economic study about the impact of the new Spanish ancillary copyright law -- and found (not surprisingly) that **the legal change (and the shuttering of Google News and other aggregators) was absolutely harmful to the Spanish news media and innovation in general**. It also found strong evidence that, contrary to what those fighting against Google News have claimed, **aggregators expand the market for the original sources, rather than shrink it by acting as a substitute**. The latter is based on a ""study of studies"" basically, looking at all of the academic literature in terms of the impact of aggregators -- all of which shows that it increases the overall size of the market, rather than shrinks it.

&gt; However, the really telling part of the report is that **this law that was passed in the name of helping news publications, ended up doing tremendous harm to many online publications** -- especially smaller sites that frequently (and happily) relied on Google News and other aggregators for a significant amount of traffic.

Additionally, the thing you insert in order to vote looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/SMZ8Cvr.jpg) (first google result, the party in there is irrelevant). As you can see, the logo is very prominent.

CSQEP's logo is this one: http://i.imgur.com/yY0g9R5.png. I'm assuming the ""star"" will occupy most of the square and the name will be small and below the square.

JxSí's logo hasn't been revealed yet, but I'm pretty sure the ""Sí"" will be very prominent. I also recall them saying they'd write ""Yes to Independence"" or something like that to the paper, so it's pretty clear which one is which.

Overall, if they manage to do it well enough, I think it can work. Most people will know which one is the correct one, and the people who gets confused will be a small minority (hopefully...).

Now, if you're asking me if it's accidental or done in purpose... I think it's mostly accidental. ""Barcelona en Comú"", the current party ruling the city of Barcelona, which is pretty much an unofficial sucursal of Podemos (and, as such, CSQEP), shouted a saying during the campaign which was ""Sí se puede"" -&gt; ""Yes we can"" (inspired by Obama...). ""Sí que es Pot"" is catalan for ""Sí se puede"", so it probably comes there.

But some people do think it's done in purpose, even though ""Junts pel Sí""'s name was announced later, in order to confuse people and because it was already known the ""Junts pel Sí"" coalition would have a Yes in its name.

Either way... hopefully not. Hopefully the campaign is well done enough so most people don't get confused.

As long as they are there we are not friends. The Ayatollahs are bent on using sectarianism to establish haegomony over the region at the expense of the KSA. This is what makes them a threat to the region and why all Sunnis are banding together against Iran. Without the Ayatollahs this wouldn't nearly be an issue. If you take the Ayatollahs out of the equation, the social and economic development would put Iran squarely in our camp. The population is young, educated, somewhat Western and desiring more freedoms. Iran has plenty of resources we need, while being pretty much the only country in the region capable of building a succesful (non-resource based) economy. This offers plenty of investment opportunities for Western companies which will strengthen ties. Yes, there is Islamism in Iran, but far, *far* less than in any other state in the region (save Turkey, thank you Ataturk), and Shi'a Islamism is far less virulent than Sunni Islamism. And the whole ""Death to America/Israel"" is hollow nationalistic rethoric resulting from them being our enemies. If we normalise relations those things will disappear soon enough.

Yes, the Ayatollahs are not our friends, and as long as they remain in power Iran wont be our friend. But if you look beyond the Ayatollahs, to everything else the country is and could be, Iran would be a very good friend of the West.

null,false,oln,EURO,Europe,null,"Norway:

Government:

**Conservative party (Høyre)**:
The main center-right pro-business conservative party (second largest party in the last election), generally liberal conservative (in the European sense), wants low taxes, privatisation, moderately socially liberal, supports status quo on immigration, the monarchy and wants to join the EU. However, since they are dependent on support from the liberals and christian democrats they haven't been able to implement a lot of what they want. The second oldest party, originally started as the parliamentary faction associated with the monarchy, in opposition to the liberals. Mostly popular with middle class and businesspeople who want less taxes.

**Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet)**
Right-wing populists, wants much less non-western immigration (but for whatever reason is silent and doesn't care too much about migration from EU countries.) Dislikes Muslims in particular, (their current leader said Norway is becoming sneak-islamised, whatever that means.) A bit more moderate than most similar parties in Europe, which they desperately try to distance themselves from. Other than immigration they are generally right wing on economics except when it comes to pensioners, and toll roads (which they really don't like.),  Only party in parliament that doesn't support the [[current policy]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_budgetary_rule) on limiting the use of the sovereign wealth fund to avoid causing economic problems and Dutch disease. Has both pro-EU and anti-EU factions, officially neutral on the issue.

Parties supporting the government:

**Liberal Party (Venstre)*:
Centrist green social liberals, Norway's oldest party, which started as the faction in the parliament wanting more powers for the parliament. Generally in the centre economically, socially progressive and strongly supportive of civil liberties and action on climate change, wants more liberal immigration policies and wants to abolish the monarchy. They are also generally supportive of giving the regional and local assemblies more powers. Officially neutral on the EU, though their voters are the most supportive of it. They like to see themselves as the party of entrepreneurs and small business.

**Christian Democratic Party (Kristelig folkeparti)**
Socially conservative christian democrats. Started by people that thought the liberal party was becoming to secular and non-religious. Generally centrist on economic issues, but the most conservative party in parliament on social issues, as the only party still opposed to same-sex marriage and abortion. It's also the only party to actively support the current EEA arrangement with the EU. Supported mainly by more religions Christian voters, particularly in the ""bible belt"" in the south.

Opposition:

**Labour Party (Arbeiderpartiet)**
Social democratic party, heavily connected to the trade unions and has been the largest party in all elections since 1927. Started as a more radical socialist party, even going so far as being part of the comitern for a few years before leaving. Nowadays they have gone more third-way, but has started to use more leftist rhetoric again after being in opposition. Otherwise socially liberal, wants to join the EU. Have supported the current status quo on non-EU immigration, but very recently wanted to accept more Syrian refugees. Supported by public sector workers, union members, middle class etc. 

**Centre party (Senterpartiet)**
Agrarian party, traditionally the political wing of the farmers interest group. Tratidionally part of and worked with the the centre-right (even going so far as flirting with the nazi movement before WWII), but was part of the centre-left coalition that was in power for 8 years until 2013. Generally centrist on economics and social issues, but are very protectionist and supportive massive farm subsidies and regulation, and eradicating wolves. They also really dislike the EU and wants to leave both the EEA and the Schengen area. Supportive of decentralisation and spending in rural areas. Mainly has support among farmers and people outside the big cities, has almost no support in the big cities. 

**Socialist left party (Sosialistisk Venstreparti)**
Democratic socialists, started as an alliance of labour party defectors and various left-wing parties in opposition to NATO and EU. Unlike many other European left-wing parties they were never particularly supportive of the Soviet Union (though had some history of support for other questionable regimes.) Support a stronger public sector, environmentalism and feminism. Is opposed to the EU and wants to leave NATO, the EEA and the Schengen area. Mainly popular with academics and students.

**Green party (Miljøpartiet De Grønne)**
Greens (duh). Elected their first MP in the last election, arguably centre-left, but officially they reject being placed on the left or right. Very socially liberal (only party that currently wants to legalise cannabis.), environmentalist, supports an economic policy focused on degrowth, wants to phase out north sea oil drilling. Popular with students and artists. Neutral on the EU.

Slightly relevant non-parliamentary parties:

**Coastal party (Kystpartiet)**
Had one MP from 1997-2005, basically a more nationalist and socially conservative version of the centre party, mainly has support in the northernmost part of Norway, their main thing was having an eccentric leader which was a whaler, and being a right-wing anti-EU party, they haven't managed to recover after the leader was replaced.

**Red party (Rødt)**
Far-left anti-capitalist socialists. Their predecessor managed to elect one MP in the 90s. Mainly has support and influence in the big cities. Has a habit of not getting the last parliamentary seat in Oslo by a small margin.

**Democrats (Demokratene)**
A much more nationalist and anti EU and EEA (and less economically conservative) version of the progress party, started by people who were expelled from the progress party, but never managed to win support on the national level.

**Pensioners party (Pensjonistpartiet)**
Basically a centre-right pensioners interest party, wants quotas for old people. Never won a seat in parliament, but has seats in many of the regional parliaments. 

**The Christians (De Kristne)**
New party started by people who thought the christian democrats was becoming too liberal, basically a socially conservative christian version of the progress party. Mainly supported by conservative Christians.

Die Linke sports some of the youngest members in the German parliament and the average age within the LINKE is exactly the same as within the CDU, CSU and SPD (59 years).  Calling their politics boring is probably the last thing you could say about them. The funny thing is, that due to their left-wing stance and SED-ties, they are ithe pariahs of the political landscape, but their political ideas are regularily picked up by other parties whenever enough time has past that nobody remembers who thought about them first. They do have some pretty clever people. But with the upcoming changes at the top, it is expected Die Linke will become more radical again. Nonetheless, they managed to become the third-largest party during the latest national elections and are part of the government of several states.

The CSU is not the Bavarian version of the CDU. The CSU is definitely not centrist nor center-right, she is as right as you can get without going into the really dirty corner. The CSU calls itself christian-socialist, but in thruth, this is just a cover up for ultra-conervative ideas. For example, the whole idea of giving mothers who raise their kids at home some bonus was a maneuver to protect the classical female role model (housewife with kids) against the idea of women sending their kids into childcare to get back into their jobs faster.

The CSU has ruled Bavaria ever since WWII with a solid majority, and like all monolitic political entities deals with nepotism and corruption. She has a strange deal with the CDU stating that the CSU will never run for office outside Bavaria, while in turn the CDU never runs for office in Bavaria. On the national level, they act as a permanent coalition which works because the number of votes in Bavaria are actually enough to get the CSU into national parliament. But somehow, the CSU regularily manages to press the CDU into supporting their political agenda, despite the CSU being the much, much smaller member in the coalition. To the CSU, Bavaria is a state of its own who's interests not only supersede the rest of the world, but the rest of Germany as well and their politics border on xenophopbic.

L'article du NY Times que tu cite ne parle pas de corrélation au sens statistique du terme. Il indique qu'il y a eue une baisse de la criminalité et un durcicement des lois carcérales dans la même periode de temps, ce que je nie pas, et cite un juge, je crois, qui dit ""cela montre bien évidement que les lois carcérales sont efficaces"". 

Or non ce n'est pas évident.

Je suis sur qu'il existe des études qui montrent l'efficacité du carcéral et je ne connaissais pas l'orientation politique de l'institut que j'ai cité mais la nécessité de démontrer qu'il existe un lien entre deux tendances est primordial. 
En dehors de l'opinion politique s'il s'avère qu'une politique carcérale n'a pas d'effet dissuasif, ce que je crois au vu de ce que j'ai pu lire, il faut réorienter les fonds vers des politiques plus portées sur l'éducation et les aspects économiques.

Ce qui est intéressant dans l'article que tu cite c'est la partie qui tente d'expliquer pourquoi les pays anglo-saxon on tendance à avoir des politiques carcérales plus punitive. Cela proviendrait de la mentalité protestante qui met l'accent sur les responsabilités de chacun. J'ai une vision plus déterministe de la chose dans le sens où je suis intimement persuadé que l'environnement social façonne la personalité. Une personne née dans la pauvreté et exposée à la notion de fortes inégalités sera, à mon sens, plus prompt a se résoudre à la violence dans l'espoir de réduire ces inégalités qu'une autre.

null,false,angryfluttershy,null,null,null,"Not an American, but the ex of a student from Michigan. A few points which may or may not answer your questions: 

1. University fees are **significantly** lower than in the US. Often the universities' administrative fees include a ""Semesterticket"" which allows you to use the public transportation of the town or sometimes even the whole Bundesland, so you don't need your own car. [Here's an overview.](http://bit.ly/1Si1P98). 
2. While, depending on the subject and your study programme, lectures and seminars are held in English, an advanced knowledge of German does make sense. Many (younger) Germans speak English quite well, but don't rely on that.
3. According to my American ex, american and German peanut butters taste differently. So far, I have yet to discover grape jelly in German supermarkets. The combination of pancakes and sausage or bacon and maple syrup is unknown, so is rootbeer (which is detested by most of the few Germans who tasted it). Our shops are not open 24/7, but close between 18:00 (small shops) and 22:00 (large supermarkets) and on Sundays. There are no free refills at restaurants, apart from Subway and some KFCs. We don't have Taco Bell, Wendy's, Krispy Kreme, Dairy Queen, Waffle House, Arby's, In 'n' Out, Chick Fil-a, Olive Garden… … …
4. To study in a German university, you have to have a health insurance. Usually, you choose a public health insurance and will be insured for ~80 €/month up to your 14th semester or 30th birthday. 
5. You need a visa/residence permit, too. The people at the Ausländerbehörde are often said to be very kind and helpful. (Haha, good one!)
6. More details on the formalities can be found here: https://www.study-in.de/en/plan-your-studies/requirements/
https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/studying/guide#green
7. Drinking age is 16 for wine and beer, 18 for harder spirits. Smoking is allowed from the age of 18. Weed is popular, but still not legalized. Religion is a more private matter than in the US, especially for Christians. Sex is less of an taboo. Gun laws are strict.

I'm also pretty sure that if the only thing that happens is a long and ongoing meta-argument over whether people from /r/european like the /r/europe mods, the majority of the /r/europe userbase isn't going to be very interested; there's little concern about the mods on the subreddit.

null,false,jbjohnson93,degree,BA in Linguistics and German,null,"When starting out, I think the best way to get the most out of it would be to treat it as an exercise in active reading. This means having not only the text in front of you, but a dictionary, and most importantly, something to take notes on and write down what you're getting out of the reading. I can think of a ton of uses for this, such as vocabulary lists, space for writing example sentences, jotting down any new or confusing idioms or grammatical constructions you see for future learning, summarization writing activities that utilize and reinforce your new vocabulary as well as highlight grammatical concepts like passive/active voices, subordination/coordination, tense, aspect, mood, etc. The list goes on.

Over time you won't need to go to this extent anymore, and your reading will become a lot more passive; you eventually get to the point where you only need the online dictionary once or twice every few pages or so, and this is usually the point where I know to start looking for more sophisticated texts after I finish.

I can especially see getting a lot of use out of those Goosebumps books, particularly if you happen to have the same books in both languages. Obviously you can get immediate comprehension if anything in the German translation isn't making sense, but more productively, it helps to take a comparative approach to the source (English) and target (German). How does the source version address that sentence on page whatever of the target that's in the past perfect passive subjunctive II? Where are the sentences similar and where do they look totally different? This helps to understand the German on a functional level, which is also helpful in turn because it allows us to see the effects of the translator's choices and the ""Germanization"" on our perception of the narrative as a quasi-cross-cultural audience.

-

**Alliance bloc**:  

-

**Moderates (23.33%):** 

Ex-Conservatives, currently social-liberal Neoliberals. Their party leadership is onboard with turning Sweden into a little American protectorate, complete with all the strife involved, and can be summarized as ""privatization is the greatest good right next to immigration"". The ideological divide within the party between the old and new Moderates is huge and thanks to policies like replacing a military Major with a conscientious objector as Defence Minister and putting a literal Islamist on the  Parliamentary Committee on Defence they're bleeding voters badly (made even worse by their agreement to let the Social Democrats budget through uncontested for nothing in return but a promise to do the same to them). 

Current party leader is mostly known for being a very weak copy of the last one as well as for signing a motion in parliament in favor of completely open borders and for saying in an interview that Stockholmers are simply more intelligent than ""rurals"" [implication being everyone else in the country].

-

**Centre (6.11%):** 

Former rural and agrarian party that used to be classical liberals but was in later years taken over by Capital inner city extremists anti-nationals crazies. Has been in co-operation outside and inside government with M for several years and is mostly seen as a hanger-on anti-taxes party for them now. They're also the richest party by far after the new inner city leadership sold off the old Agrarians massive newspaper corporate group. Unsurprisingly most of this means they've been floating near the 4% requirement of parliamentary irrelevancy every other election. 

Party leader is mostly known for being a literal Ayn Randbot who pushed out a manifesto supporting open borders, polygamy and similar views that made pretty much all the local party representatives publicly tell her and her supporters to retract it if they didn't want to be replaced.

-

**The People's Party Liberals (5.42%):** 

The party for people who would sell out their own mother if they could consider themselves cosmopolitan ""europeans"" for a day and supports NATO for similar reasons. Not all that Liberal as a party and tends to be more than a bit moralist-statist. Mostly known for being hangers-on for the Moderates with their profile issue being the ""more strict schooling"" line and for lying every few years, at least since the early 2000s, about wanting language tests for immigrants and then dropping the issue the second they've got in the papers again. 

Party leader is mostly known for the party's stance on schooling and for having an anecdote about a regular person's views for every single political issue he'll debate.

-

**Christian Democrats (4.57%):** 

Support party for the Moderates (and gets support votes from Moderates for the same reason). So liberalized that they've barely put forward a christian or conservative view in years outside of the highly Conservative youth party and have long been teethering on the edge of falling under the required 4% to be in Parliament. Recently they voted in a known hardline Conservative Christian party leader, mostly in response to the success of SD going by their few ventures into anti-immigration rethoric, who is attempting to turn that around. 

Current party leader is too new to be all the well-known but she did grow up in the prosperity-theological charismatic evangelical Livets Ord sect so there's some reminiscence of the more pseudo-""Christian"" American Republicans to be found. 

-

**Social Democrat  bloc**:

-

**Social Democrats (31.01%):** 

Ex-Social Democrat nearly uncontested rulers for most of the last century, currently limpwristed neoliberals with strong union ties (to the ones they helped found anyway). Doesn't stand for much more than neoliberalism with tinges of support for the welfare state (they pretty much never reinstate something once the Moderates have done away with it) and the occasional spiel from one of their internal factions on some burning issue of identity politics (which very rarely blows back on them, as with the Islamist PM they tried pushing). 

Current party leader is mostly known for succeeding a whole bunch of unsuccessful and externally/internally despised clowns that were removed in short succession and for being an ex-trade union leader which is rare for a Social Democrat politician.

-

**Greens: (6.89%):** 

Entirely image-obsessed. If it doesn't sound good in a tweet they couldn't care less. Talks a lot about how much they care about the environment and then subsequently ignore it completely by destroying our energy infrastructure vis a vis nuclear even though they KNOW it'll end with us importing coal power in lieu of it. Cares about nothing beyond their own image so they're huge on identity politics and their only real concern inside of their government coalitions has been pushing for even more immigration. Absolutely despised among a large part of rurals because of the parties support of higher oil taxes and simultaneous refusal to invest in any public infrastructure outside of the Stockholm area. All of which leads them to be the favorite party of swedish journalists by a mile. 

Party leader is mostly well-known for stating in speeches that environmental pollution is really the white men's fault and for the subsequent scandal where she had her boat painted with illegal toxic paint and her neglecting to pay the energy tax on the diesel for it. 

-

**Left party (5.72%):** 

""Ex""-authoritarian communists whose biggest political issue at one point in time was a split between the people who wanted to sell us out to the Soviets and those who wanted to sell us out to China. Currently the party of identity political leftists who still have a minor spark of economic leftism in their bodies and thus don't feel it's right to vote for the bobo Greens. They've started to quietly purge small radical parts of the party after they started to lose the media war over their ongoing support of ""anti-democratic elements"" i.e. violent thugs from AFA and Revolutionary Front. Core issue nowadays, at least the only one that has any mainstream support, is that they stand against profits being allowed within the welfare system. Likes to pretend to be euroskeptic but doesn't really work against it in any way. 

Current party leader is mostly known for being the protege of the last one who was an avowed communist and for not having his place of residence listed in the last election's vote pamphlet like the other representatives of his party since he lives in a rent-controlled flat on Östermalm, one of the most distinctly liberal bourgeoise districts in Stockholm.

-

***The Opposition***

**Sweden Democrats (12.86%):** 

Anti-immigration Euroskeptic Conservative Nationalists with Centrist welfare-statism economic views. Newest party in parliament as it has only really been represented for the last three elections. Skyrocketing in votes, practically doubling their votes every election (currently polling to do the same at 23.3% only about a year after the 12.86% result), largely thanks to the extreme immigration policy pushed uniformly by the seven other parties and being the party in sole opposition to it. Has issues with the massive growth of the party attracting local political yokels of various shades and a few old remnants from it's days as a fringe party (including one or two of the party's top) but even those people haven't been able to make them lose votes even once so far since the media has lost so much trust on the issue among regular people after mudslinging them at every opportunity, justified or not, for about 8 years straight. 

The party leader is mostly well-known for being that evil man who dares to use facts and logic rather than feelings in debates about immigration and the closest thing to a verifiable scandal he personally has had is singing a rather nasty cheerful drinking song about the assassination of Olof Palme (the PM who first went full-swing with liberalizing our immigration policy).

Vernünftiger Glaube oder Irrlicht der Menschheit?""](http://www.amazon.de/Warum-Vern%C3%BCnftiger-Glaube-Irrlicht-Menschheit/dp/3765517666) zeigt hast du den christlichen Glauben fundamental mißverstanden:
  
&gt;Warum der christliche Glaube die Welt retten kann
  
&gt;Das große Finale – diese Aussage stört. Religion ist wahrhaftig entzweiend – doch der christliche Glaube hat die Mittel, um über solche Gruben zu springen und entzweiende Tendenzen zu heilen. Christen glauben, dass alle Menschen im Bild Gottes geschaffen sind, also als zu Güte und Weisheit fähige Wesen. Ja, Christen können sogar davon ausgehen, dass Nichtgläubige in ihrem Verhalten besser sein können, als es ihren irrigen Glaubensvorstellungen entspricht. Es ist hier jede Menge Raum für gegenseitige Achtung, denn selbst der beste Christ weiß, dass er fallen kann und Sünde ein Problem dieser Erde, auf der er lebt, ist.
  
&gt;Ein echter Christ ist sogar so weit zu sagen, dass das Leben eines „Heiden“ sogar moralisch seinem eigenen Leben überlegen sein kann. Die meisten Menschen glauben ja, dass wir durch ein besser geführtes Leben, wodurch dich Gott annimmt, zu Gott kommen. Doch die Bibel lehrt genau das Gegenteil. Jesus sagt uns nicht, wie wir besser leben können, damit wir unsere Erlösung verdienen, sondern er kommt zu uns, um uns zu vergeben und zu erretten. Gnade kommt nicht zu dem, der die meisten moralischen Punkte bei Gott hat, sondern zu denen, die ihr Versagen zugeben und Erlösung brauchen.
  
&gt;Es sollte also einen Christen nicht verwundern, wenn es Nichtchristen gibt, die freundlicher und netter, weise und besser sind als sie selbst. Die meisten Menschen in Religionen glauben, dass sie durch ihre religiösen Leistungen zu Gott kommen können, was sie natürlich leicht dazu verführt, sich „Nichtgläubigen“ überlegen zu fühlen. Das Christentum sollte diese Wirkung nicht haben.
  
&gt;Der christliche Glaube hat fundamentale Überzeugungen, die ihre Anhänger dazu bringen gegenüber Andersdenkenden besonders offen und liebevoll zu sein. Wie kam es sonst, dass ein solch Ausschließlichkeit beanspruchender Glaube zu einem Verhalten führte, das so offen gegenüber anderen Menschen war? Sehen wir zum Beispiel die griechisch-römische Kultur und ihre Spanne zwischen Arm und Reich und vielen gesellschaftlich verachteten Menschen oder die niedere gesellschaftliche Stellung der Frau. All das wagte das Christentum zu bekämpfen, sie kümmerten sich um Arme, um Ausgestoßene, um Kranke und bot Frauen eine ungleich größere Sicherheit und Gleichheit als die antike Welt. Wie kam das, trotz ihrer engstirnigen Grundüberzeugungen?
  
&gt;Im Herzen ihrer Weltanschauung stand ein starker Anreiz zu Aufopferung: Das Leben eines Dieners und Friedensstifters, der für seine Feinde gestorben war und um Vergebung für sie bat. Am Kreuz. Wer über ihn nachdachte, konnte nicht anders, als Andersdenkenden gut zu tun und Widersachern völlig neu zu begegnen, die Gewalt und Unterdrückung ausschloss.
  
&gt;Es ist eine Tatsache, dass die Kirche im Namen Gottes viele Verbrechen beging. Aber wer will leugnen, dass das christliche Werkzeug mächtig sind, um dieser zerrissenen Welt Frieden zu schenken? Der christliche Glaube mit seinen Grundüberzeugungen ist die einzige Weltanschauung, die vermag Mauern abzubrechen und nicht aufzubauen, ohne auf Ausschließlichkeit zu verzichten, denn er beruht auf Vergebung Gottes, die man sich nicht erarbeiten kann, für die der Mensch also gar nichts kann. Diese Tatsache sollten sich Nichtchristen, aber vielmehr auch gläubige Christen neu vergegenwärtigen.

In order of popularity over the past 10 years or so.

- Nea Dimokratia (New Democracy): Accepted in the European Popular Party, it is **Center-Right**. Was in power from 2004-2009, and leading the governing coalition from 2012-2015. It never fell below the 2nd place in the past 40 years. It has factions, during 2004-2009 it was more towards the center and more friendly to Russia, while in previous times it was more friendly to USA. After 2009 it became more Germany-friendly because Samaras, the new leader, changed the course (he also turned the wheel way to the right...). It gladly absorbed members from LAOS and DIMAR (see below) while it is accused of having some relations with Golden Dawn and it certainly has absorbed members of the junta after 1974.

- PASOK is **center-left**, accepted in the european Social-Democrats party. Currently very weakened at around 5%, it was the strongest party in the past 30 years, earning 44% in 2009 elections. It paid the bulk of the political cost of the crisis. It has some factions, started as a populist left party in 1981 but since 1993 it became more serious, often accused of being more rightish than its rivals. Ruled from 1993-2004 non stop. Charged with a long list of scandals, relatively longer than its traditionally rival even if we consider that it ruled for a longer time. They started as anti-USA but seems they turned pro-europe without deviations.

- KKE (Communists). They are hardcore communists, they follow a doctrine, do not allow deviations inside them, they enjoy at least 5% constantly, their worst enemy is SYRIZA. They lover Russia. Their agenda includes a non-negotiable exit from NATO and EU, nationalisation of everything etc.

- SYRIZA (COalition of RAdical Left) is the currently ruling party, used to enjoy a 4% constantly over the past 20 years, exploded to 17% and then 27% in 2012, now 36%. It is **left**. It has numerous factions, some of them pretty radical, others are more eager to discuss stuff. Together with KKE they do not suffer from scandals. After the recent signing of the 3rd bailout program a large part of it is going to split, something that will happen probably in autumn. The splitting part is around 1/3 of its MPs but I bet it will not enjoy more than perhaps 5% in the next elections. It is accused of being pro-Russia, although its affiliations with USA are more probable. It absorbed several PASOK members. The various factions have a multitude of stances, for instance there is a Maoist faction, but democratic procedures inside it usually ensure that the most reasonable decisions are taken. Tsipras, its leader, appears to be irreplaceable. It is accused of having affiliations with anarchists.

- Golden Dawn. They are nazis, pretending to be merely a gang of nationalists. Traditionally at 0.5%, they exploded to 7% in 2012 and their popularity is currently at 12%. They were imprisoned after their immunity was revoked after being charged for forming a criminal organisation which commited murders and other felonies. Their worst enemy is anarchists.

- ANEL (INdependent GReeks) formed after 2009. They are **right**. They popped out of Nea Dimokratia, they are more towards the right, they seem to have strong bonds with Russia. They are accused for being too nationalistic. They participate in the current government. Its leader, Kammenos, was a minister during 2004-2009 Nea Dimokratia times.

- LAOS was slightly above 3%. It lost its power after it participated in the 2010 government and then some of its most prominent members departed for Samaras' Nea Dimokratia. It is **far right**. One of its ""traitors"", Adonis Georgiadis, is perhaps the most ridiculous politician in Europe, he trolls more easily than he breathes.

- DIMAR (DEMocratic LEft) was a branch of SYRIZA that broke off after 2009 and it also took parts of PASOK. It claimed it is *left*, it then claimed it is social-democrats, in the end it participated in the 2012 government and from 6% its popularity now stands to 0.01%. It is virtually a dead party.

- POTAMI (River) is a self-claimed to be center-left but it is plain *neoliberal*. It formed recently and enjoys some 8% popularity.

I tried to be objective and politically correct. Here come subjective additional views.

- Nea Dimokratia is a serious party but it has many non-serious members. It is the party of the nomenclature, of the status kwo. It seems to partially control DIMAR, POTAMI and perhaps Golden Dawn. Its scandals are many but not as many as those of PASOK. Despite claiming to be the serious party, it was during its times that Greek economy went off-tracks, while even in 1990-1993 it failed to fix the problems accumulated by the previous PASOK government (debt, inflation, trade deficit). It still controls the media in Greece in the most disgusting way. Samaras is, uhm, not a true fan of democracy I'd say. It is ridiculous how, in 2004, when it finally rose to power after 11 years, it followed a more leftish policy than its predecessor and it even did the unthinkable: hired a record high 800k public servants (most were short-term though, clearly votes fishing).

- PASOK is the king of scandals, with 2 of its former ministers in prison. When it took power in 1981 it doubled the number of public servants and tripled the debt within 3 years lol. It deflated violently in 2010, its voters went mainly to SYRIZA. Those 2 parties I hate them for being the corruption in Greece but most of them Pasok. Pasok tried to rapidly create its own nomenclature after 1981 but the new oligarchs, once established, usually had no reason to remain loyal to Pasok: they would switch to Nea Dimokratia. The stock market scandal after 1997 is perhaps the most ridiculous scandal in Greece and I attribute it to Pasok failing to control the prices (the index rose from 800 to 7000 before falling to 1400 or so, many people lost their properties).

- SYRIZA is accused of being not serious, you know, the usual arguments against the left. However it seems to partially make its enemies true. The economy derailed during its times (granted, everyone wanted Syriza to fail) and the negotiations did not go well (again, everyone wanted the negotiations to not go well). It is experiencing a potentially fatal crisis right now, although I believe it will survive. Its leader appears to be ready to compromise but he also appears to hate corruption so much it's unbelievable. Its complexity and democratic structure constitute its strongest points, with its leader being very loyal to the rules of the coalition. However its propaganda wars were too one-dimensioned, with a prolonged omission of corruption and scandals (now it has corruption and tax evasion at top priority, probably foreseeing that it will lose power before doing much else). It is disgusting how all parties since 2009-10 concentrate all their hate against Syriza. Perhaps this is why people chose it: if all powers accuse it, then it must be good! It does have some utterly ridiculous members, but who doesn't?

- Potami is promoted by EU and the media, is friends with Nea Dimokratia and looks like it would be more than happy to apply neoliberal policies even harsher than the present ones. There are family relationships between prominent members of Potami, DIMAR and Nea Dimokratia.

- ANEL are accused of being non-serious. They seem to endorse conspiracy theories. Its leader is a dirty person according to personal information (the former leader of PASOK is also a dirty person according to personal information, but he seems to at least have some limits and he is damn smart).

Both PASOK and Nea Dimokratia cannot, due to dependencies, fight cartels, corruption and tax evasion.

Syriza used to propagandise in favor of immigrants, but now it has to see the true dimensions of the problem. Nea Dimokratia has a very peculiar stance towards immigrants and it has switched abruptly in the past 25 years. Golden Dawn really hates immigrants.

Only Potami, a couple minor parties, including a weird one which enjoys a spectacular popularity in the most wealthy neighborhoods of Athens and promotes the creation of... labor camps, and a faction of Nea Dimocratia are unquestionably in favor of austerity (liberal).

And Hillary Clinton might be hawkish foreign policy-wise but on economic and domestic issues she is right there with Bernie (although she is much more indirect when she discusses her views).,null,0,null,1438213655,null,0,false,0,ctkxiot,null,t3_3f1u3r,null,t1_ctkxiot,null,t1_ctkso2a,null,null,null,1440167900,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Wie [Timothy Keller](http://www.timothykeller.com/) in seinem Buch [""Warum Gott? Vernünftiger Glaube oder Irrlicht der Menschheit?""](http://www.amazon.de/Warum-Vern%C3%BCnftiger-Glaube-Irrlicht-Menschheit/dp/3765517666) zeigt hast du den christlichen Glauben fundamental mißverstanden:
  
&gt;Warum der christliche Glaube die Welt retten kann
  
&gt;Das große Finale – diese Aussage stört. Religion ist wahrhaftig entzweiend – doch der christliche Glaube hat die Mittel, um über solche Gruben zu springen und entzweiende Tendenzen zu heilen. Christen glauben, dass alle Menschen im Bild Gottes geschaffen sind, also als zu Güte und Weisheit fähige Wesen. Ja, Christen können sogar davon ausgehen, dass Nichtgläubige in ihrem Verhalten besser sein können, als es ihren irrigen Glaubensvorstellungen entspricht. Es ist hier jede Menge Raum für gegenseitige Achtung, denn selbst der beste Christ weiß, dass er fallen kann und Sünde ein Problem dieser Erde, auf der er lebt, ist.
  
&gt;Ein echter Christ ist sogar so weit zu sagen, dass das Leben eines „Heiden“ sogar moralisch seinem eigenen Leben überlegen sein kann. Die meisten Menschen glauben ja, dass wir durch ein besser geführtes Leben, wodurch dich Gott annimmt, zu Gott kommen. Doch die Bibel lehrt genau das Gegenteil. Jesus sagt uns nicht, wie wir besser leben können, damit wir unsere Erlösung verdienen, sondern er kommt zu uns, um uns zu vergeben und zu erretten. Gnade kommt nicht zu dem, der die meisten moralischen Punkte bei Gott hat, sondern zu denen, die ihr Versagen zugeben und Erlösung brauchen.
  
&gt;Es sollte also einen Christen nicht verwundern, wenn es Nichtchristen gibt, die freundlicher und netter, weise und besser sind als sie selbst. Die meisten Menschen in Religionen glauben, dass sie durch ihre religiösen Leistungen zu Gott kommen können, was sie natürlich leicht dazu verführt, sich „Nichtgläubigen“ überlegen zu fühlen. Das Christentum sollte diese Wirkung nicht haben.
  
&gt;Der christliche Glaube hat fundamentale Überzeugungen, die ihre Anhänger dazu bringen gegenüber Andersdenkenden besonders offen und liebevoll zu sein. Wie kam es sonst, dass ein solch Ausschließlichkeit beanspruchender Glaube zu einem Verhalten führte, das so offen gegenüber anderen Menschen war? Sehen wir zum Beispiel die griechisch-römische Kultur und ihre Spanne zwischen Arm und Reich und vielen gesellschaftlich verachteten Menschen oder die niedere gesellschaftliche Stellung der Frau. All das wagte das Christentum zu bekämpfen, sie kümmerten sich um Arme, um Ausgestoßene, um Kranke und bot Frauen eine ungleich größere Sicherheit und Gleichheit als die antike Welt. Wie kam das, trotz ihrer engstirnigen Grundüberzeugungen?
  
&gt;Im Herzen ihrer Weltanschauung stand ein starker Anreiz zu Aufopferung: Das Leben eines Dieners und Friedensstifters, der für seine Feinde gestorben war und um Vergebung für sie bat. Am Kreuz. Wer über ihn nachdachte, konnte nicht anders, als Andersdenkenden gut zu tun und Widersachern völlig neu zu begegnen, die Gewalt und Unterdrückung ausschloss.
  
&gt;Es ist eine Tatsache, dass die Kirche im Namen Gottes viele Verbrechen beging. Aber wer will leugnen, dass das christliche Werkzeug mächtig sind, um dieser zerrissenen Welt Frieden zu schenken? Der christliche Glaube mit seinen Grundüberzeugungen ist die einzige Weltanschauung, die vermag Mauern abzubrechen und nicht aufzubauen, ohne auf Ausschließlichkeit zu verzichten, denn er beruht auf Vergebung Gottes, die man sich nicht erarbeiten kann, für die der Mensch also gar nichts kann. Diese Tatsache sollten sich Nichtchristen, aber vielmehr auch gläubige Christen neu vergegenwärtigen.

Republicans wouldn't refuse to do so. The Party's main goal is to get elected. That, above anything else, will drive their positions on issues. Our Two Party System is self-correcting in that manner.

&gt; Wouldnt this make the US a defacto dictatorship of the Democratic party? 

At the moment, there's still more support for the Republicans in terms of voter base. The growing minority populations in the U.S. (particularly Hispanics) [do not have good voter turnout rates](http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/demographics) (the issue is quite complicated actually, since poorer minorities are more likely to have to jump through several hoops to get the proper documents in order to vote; see the history of [Voter ID laws in the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_ID_laws_in_the_United_States)).

&gt; I am just wondering why isnt there the will in the US present to introduce a proportional parlament like in most democracies? 

I'm not an expert on every European form of government, but the responsibilities of government are split between the Federal (national), state, and local (city) levels. The U.S. Congress (our legislature) only operates to pass laws and budgets. With respect to some issues, the President acts separately from Congress (e.g., defense, foreign policy, justice department). On other issues, he has to act more closely (health care, social safety net, treaties).

&gt; Quite honestly just from my outside perspective I think both parties are kind of horrible and think that already the majority of Americans are outside the pattern (politically) than the two big parties.

No disagreement here. Both parties work together to subvert the popularity of third parties. IMO, most Americans are too busy with work and life to want to spend time to understand the intricacies of our political system.

Example: when you set your alarm for ""tomorrow 8am"" when its past midnight, the software noticed that a lot of people corrected the alarm to ""today 8am"" because that was what was truly intended. So now Siri will ask you if you meant today or tomorrow when you ask this request.

Historically, there was a period of American politics in the early 19th century after Jefferson's presidency where the Democratic Republicans (the precursors to the Democratic party) held a virtual monopoly on politics, but the broad coalition collapsed with the argument over who would succeed James Monroe, resulting in the emergence of the Democratic Party and the National Republicans, who would merge with the Whigs.

&gt;On 30 November 1993, SD organized a manifestation to celebrate the late
king of Sweden, Karl XII. Approximately 1000 people took part in the
event, which ended in chaos and violence. At the front, the Nazi flag dangled
beside the national Swedish flag. On this particular night in Stockholm, the
entire city-centre resonated to the crowd’s shouts of ‘Sieg Heil’ (see further
Tamas, 2003). In 1989, SD held its first annual meeting and elected Anders
Klarström as the party’s president. Prior to this, Klarström had been a
member of the neo-Nazi party Nordiska Rikspartiet and had a criminal
record that included the stealing of ammunition, vandalism and making
illegal threats (Larsson and Ekman, 2001: 126). Other representatives of the
party executive had similar backgrounds. Some were members of violent
extreme right movements such as the Vitt Ariskt Motstånd (White Arian
Resistance) and Bevara Sverige Svenskt (Keep Sweden Swedish), or
involved in the growing industry of white power music. In its members’
bulletin of 1989, SD published a list of addresses of allies outside Sweden,
i.e. the Front National in France, pro-apartheid newspapers in South Africa,
a Ku Klux Klan affiliated journal in the USA and the journal Spearhead,
published by the notorious neo-Nazist John Tydall in England (Larsson and

I highly highly doubt it. Living in the second most densely populated country in Europe (aside from some microstates &amp; small islands) my granmother still had difficulty getting a half decent cable connection in one of the more remote areas at a reasonable price. (edit: Someone mentioned prices are decent in Russia but coverage is an issue) There's plenty of cheap land in Russia comparatively and you can grow your own food in more hospitable areas too.

&gt;they'll still be able to order things online for example

Living at least 10 kilometers from the nearest notable town in eastern Russia.
It'll really depend on where you live but again it won't be cheap.
I think if you're going there and expect to be comfortable all the way you wouldn't have done it for this offer. Because you likely already have a good reason(well paying job) to go there or a good amount of money.


&gt;that's how towns get stared. 

Often there's a reason towns get started. Most often it's necessity as people need a place to live and some areas accommodate better than others in terms of soil, jobs, trade whatever. This project could be one of those reasons if a few decide to organise or if there's some area that requires workers but with current urbanisation and an area unattractive for many it may not always matter.
Just a few hours ago I watched a show with some chef(Jeroen Meus) visiting the more remote eastern areas of Russia: small soviet era town, everyone once had work. Nowadays: last 2 houses inhabited there. The kids leave for jobs or the bigger cities and in the end it's still just that. A remote area in the woods.

Sure it's attractive to some. I'm not here to discuss with you whether someone may like the idea of starting from almost nothing in the middle of nowhere. Sure plenty are. But enough to get close to estimated results? Enough so it doesn't get remembered as a move that led to a lot of land in hands it wasn't meant for?

What ticks me off is that I've seen maybe twenty comments out of hundreds of comments that actually deal with:

* Immigration

* Thoughts for or against

I'm happy to debate immigration.  I'm even happy to debate racial concerns.  But that's not actually what has been showing up so far.  The overwhelming majority consist of complaints about the format or the mods, and normally on grounds that I don't find very interesting.

If someone is willing to say ""I don't want black African people living in the UK, because I'm worried about an increased level of rape happening"", fine by me.  I can go dig up crime statistics on race, crime statistics on immigrants, on multi-generation immigrants, and that's something that can at least be argued.  People may not, on the net, *agree* with you, but at least it's something that I'd care about, and I'd be willing to talk about it.  We had almost exactly that discussion earlier on rape frequency in Finland on a thread on /r/europe, in fact.

But if it consists of an endless ""the moderators suck"", then I just don't *care* about it.

Thus far, I've seen one short thread on ""cultural Marxism"" (which commenters simply took to PM, and I didn't see any mods becoming involved with, and is still up).  That was probably the extent of people trying to explain concerns and positions, and it wasn't terribly deep.  The rest of it has been a handful of news stories (which have been posted in the megathread) and a lot of complaining about the mods.  One person complained to me privately that they were banned from the sub, but the examples they PMed me had them sending insults to the mods repeatedly immediately prior to that ban; I wasn't all that sympathetic.

Let's say that the megathread format goes away, and individual threads show up.  Do we just wind up with the same stuff, but now spread across many threads?  That doesn't seem all that compelling to me -- we don't even have enough real content/discussion that I've seen to fill *one* thread.  Get some interesting content up here, and there'd be, I think, a stronger argument for needing to spread it out further.  That hasn't, thus far, happened.

On the up side, the mass-downvoting of the /r/europe mods seems to have decreased, and my comments don't seem to be getting downvoted if they're pro-immigration (so kudos to the anti-immigration folks).  There's still some downvoting of the anti-immigration folks, but it doesn't seem to me to be content-agnostic, at least.

Obviously, this freaked the fuck out of everyone, because they were now this tiny sovereign nation removed from all the old agreements with enough nuclear firepower to fuck up anyone's shit at the drop of an ushanka.

So the Budapest Memorandum was signed:

In return for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons (repatriating them and all attendant mechanisms and launch vehicles and platforms to Russia):

______________________________________

* 1: The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.



* 2: The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.

* 3: The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to refrain from economic coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by Ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind.

* 4: The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of[4] an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.

* 5: The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm, in the case of Ukraine, their commitment not to use nuclear weapons against any non-nuclearweapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, except in the case of an attack on themselves, their territories or dependent territories, their armed forces, or their allies, by such a State in association or alliance with a nuclear-weapon State.

* 6: Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America will consult in the event a situation arises that raises a question concerning these commitments
_____________________________________________________

The Ukrainians signed this agreement in good faith, and went from being perhaps the third or fourth most powerful nuclear armed nation on the planet, to a disarmed one relying on a conventional segment of the former Soviet military, and an economy in tatters.

Poroshenko is calling out the West with this request.

He's shaming them: 

You couldn't even protect us when we gave up the single most powerful martial bargaining chip a nation can have - - at least give us some means to defend our land from Russian tanks.


*So what I'm saying*

Is that any leadership in any nuclear armed and non-treaty signatory nation, and any close to nuclear nation can just look at this - - - - look at a treaty that eventually had **all** members of the UNSC agreeing to non-violence for the sake of nuclear non-proliferation, and see that:

1) Conventional military action in the 21st century is an option for larger powers to destroy smaller ones

2) Nations that pledged to have your back, unless they've done so with specific military guarantees, will leave you to have your shit wrecked by those larger powers if you're in a conflict with them

3) No one fucks with North Korea, despite all they do. No one fucks with Pakistan, despite all they do. Everyone knows Israel has a nuke, and no one can really fuck with them either.

4) Ukraine clearly got fucked

There's literally no more argument for nuclear non-proliferation, firstly because Putin decided to go to war against Ukraine, and then because the West was collectively dickless in preventing it from continuing.

All I will say is that having been banned for ""advocating mass murder"" seems strange, because what is war but mass murder? Do the mods believe that there can be no justifiable war? Was WW2 not a justifiable war? Was it morally wrong to kill Nazis en masse? Do they believe the Allies never should have gotten involved because to advocate mass murder is deontologically wrong in principle?

Can they not think of a single war in the entire of world history which was justifiable or are all of them wrong? Given that their countries current order were founded on and created by war, it seems a strange principle to not only be against, but to believe that anybody who does not share your opinion is not allowed to speak. I like lively debate and it is disappointing that this is not allowed here.

This further solidifies my opinion that these ""Megathreads"" are simply a honey trap. The mods have set them up to tease out people like me out into posting our sincere opinions, to get all the people they consider ""toxic"" in one place, so they can individually remove them and have a subreddit entirely dedicated to holding the same opinions and beliefs.

[..] Downvotes

lieber Sc3p, ich betreibe das spiel öffentlicher diskussionen in foren oder boards jetzt seit 1993 und mir ist es reichlich egal, ob jemand das mag, was ich sage oder nicht. 

wenn ich genau einen gesprächspartner habe, der antwortet und nach seiner antwort von 1 punkt auf 0 heruntergesetzt werde, dann kann ich daraus schließen, daß sich mein gegenüber über das, was ich gesagt habe, geärgert und seinem frust mit einem downvote luft gemacht hat. 1 und 1 sind, wie prof. dr dr dr augustus van dusen zurecht bemerkt immer und überall zwei.

es war auch kein jammern darüber, daß er es getan hat, ich habe mich lustig gemacht. aber ironie oder sarkasmus sind jedermanns sache nicht.

ob du mich jetzt für inkompetent hälst, dinge wie handys oder f#ckbook zu beurteilen, ist mir ziemlich wurst. ich habe mich in ""ziemlich dumme ideen"" eindeutig erklärt, wann ich welche entscheidung für mich getroffen habe und kann das, was seitdem passiert ist, als unbeteiligter beobachter, der menschen dabei zuguckt, wie sie technologieen, von denen ich dummerweise eben was verstehe, einsetzen und wie sie von diesen technologieen verändert werden. 

das ist etwas, was du nicht kannst, weil du eben nicht beide seiten bewusst im verlauf ihrer entwicklungen _erlebt_ hast. ich habe entscheidungen getroffen, die sich zunehmend als richtig herausstellen. daß es manchmal ganz gut ist ""nein"" zu sagen.

du hat offensichtlich nicht mal das problem verstanden.

mein motto für 2015 ist ""wir sollten vielleicht nur die hälfte von dem tun, was wir so tun, und die so gewonnene zeit damit zubringen, darüber nachzudenken, ob wir es überhaupt tun sollen"".

du bist in einer ""matrix"". du hast eine technologie adaptiert und reflektierst sie nicht, weil sie für dich ""normal"" ist. ich habe mitte der 80er eine adaptiert und jederzeit reflektiert, was ich tue oder zulasse oder eben nicht. meine generation hat sich gegen die volkszählung erfolgreich gewehrt, deine (i suppose) gibt bei der anmeldung bei den diensten mehr von sich preis, als wir in unseren übelsten alpträumen dachten. 

ich würde das eine frage des ""bewußtseins"" betrachten. nur weil dir dinge nicht bewusst sind, heisst das nicht automatisch, daß sie auch nicht da sind.

ich denke schon, daß ich ""kompetent"" bin. ich mag irren und du hast ""recht"". aber ich befürchte, du irrst und projezierst mich lieber als ""inkompetent"" als mit der reflektion zu beginnen. dabei kannst du doch nachgucken, was ich für einer bin. 

ziemlich irre, schon okay, aber nicht inkompetent ...

Der Neoliberalismus, das Internet und wir 

http://mp3-download.swr.de/swr2/feature/podcast/2014-10-08-pathologien-der-freiheit.19244s.mp3

*""Seit den Enthüllungen Edward Snowdens wird allenthalben für die Freiheit des Internets gestritten. Aber was ist das für eine Freiheit, und wie ist das Internet zu dem geworden, was es heute ist? ""Pathologien der Freiheit"" zeichnet den kritischen Netzdiskurs nach von den 1980er-Jahren bis heute und zeigt, wie im zweiten Anlauf aus der Asche der Dot-Com-Krise und der Twin Towers das neoliberale Internet entsteht, in dem heute Staaten, Geheimdienste und Unternehmen eine lückenlose Kalkulation und Kontrolle der Individuen und Bevölkerung anstreben. Michel Foucault hatte schon in den 1970er-Jahren mit seinen Analysen des Neoliberalismus gezeigt, welche Kontrollgesellschaft sich abzeichnet und wie wir selbst durch unser aktives Mitwirken dem System zum Erfolg verhelfen, indem wir uns als selbstoptimierte Subjekte schaffen. Genau damit geben wir den Unternehmen und Geheimdiensten erst die Möglichkeit, uns in einer Freiheitsfalle gefangen zu halten.""*

greedy/cheap Scot jokes I guess

Here are some Scot jokes from Hungary I found on a 2013 posting of this image:

    In a dark corner a scottish guy got stopped by a mugger.

    ""100 pounds or your life!""

    ""Here's 50. I'm already half dead from the scare.""

_

    The scot and his son are walking in the market. Suddenly the son asks:

    ""Dad, can I get an orange?""

    ""No.""

    ""But dad! I'd really like one!""

    ""Alright son, then spit on a vendor and maybe he'll throw one at you!""

_

    A scottish kid asks his dad:

    ""Daddy, what will be under the christmas tree this year?""

    ""Floor.""

_

    The scot is cutting the grass in the garden, when his wife shouts out the window:

    ""John! There're two guys here. They asking for donations for the new public swimming pool. What should I give them?""

    ""Two baskets of water!""

_

    The scot is in terrible pain, because of his teeth. He goes to the dentist, and in the dentist chair he starts nervously checking his pockets.

    ""Don't worry, you don't have to pay in advance!"" - Says the doctor

    ""I'm not worried about that. Just want to count my money before the anastesia!""

_

    Two scottish guys meet at the café. One of them tells the other that he'll have a date there today.

    ""And? She's not here yet?""

    ""Yeah, she's here. The girl at the corner table.""

    ""And what's the matter?""

    ""I asked her, that she should eat donuts so I can recognise her. She's eating the fifth one, but I'm waiting for her to become full, so I don't have to buy dinner for her.""",null,0,null,1438220805,null,0,false,0,ctl1ryo,null,t3_3f3sq3,null,t1_ctl1ryo,null,t1_ctl17yp,null,null,null,1440169972,null,106,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,106,null

My overview lists all parties that have participated in the last European elections, apart from those named above. I've used the [""Wahl-O-Mat""](https://www.wahl-o-mat.de/europawahl2014/main_app.php) as a source.

**FDP** (""Free Democratic Party""): Germany's liberal party. Used to be part of many CDU/CSU coalition governments, but has lost most of its voters over the last few years. Pro European integration.

**Die Partei** (""The Party""): Satirical party founded by the editors of the satirical magazine ""Titanic"". Their aims are to build a wall around Germany, introduce a ""lazy quota"", reform the school system so there's only one year of education, and a limitation of manager salaries to 25,000x that of a normal worker. Currently has one seat in the European Parliament and is thus the first satirical party to make it to the EP. 

**Freie Wähler** (""Free voters""): Mostly active on local scale, e.g. when it comes to voting for village councilors. Against bailouts, pro alternative currencies. Wants more transparency and a ""parliament of the regions"" that would be able to elect the European Commission. Says it's free from ideologies.

**Die Republikaner** (""The Republicans""): Deeply conservative populist nationalist party. Their goals can be summed up with ""Deutschland über alles"". Had or have a deal with the NPD not to candidate in elections at the same time. 

**PRO NRW** (""Pro Northrine-Westphalia""): Regional neonazi party. Pretty much no differences between them and the NPD. 

**Volksabstimmung** (""From now on... Democracy through Referendums - Politics for People"" (long name, I know)): Nationalist-conservative. Doesn't like Romania and Bulgaria in the EU. Doesn't like the EU either. Wants a referendum system like in Switzerland. 

**Bayernpartei** (""Bavarians' Party""): Power should be ceded from the German government to Bavaria. Demands the teaching of regional dialects, as well as ""Bavarian history from a Bavarian perspective"". EU should be decentralised. Traditional families only. 

**FamilienPartei** (""Family Party""): As the name suggests, a strong focus on families. Parents should be paid and get pension boosts for educating the kids while they grow up; tax breaks for families be introduced (instead of married people). On a European scale, they want to introduce a unified tax and toll system, as well as a minimum wage. 

**Piraten** (""Pirates""): This local version of the Pirates is pro transparency, freedom of information, citizens' rights, copyright reforms, privacy and so on. 

**ödp** (""Ecological-Democratic Party""): Another ""greens"" party. Apart from the usual stuff, they want to give legislative powers to the European Parliament. 

**Partei Mensch Umwelt Tierschutz** (""Party Human Environment Animal Protection""): A ""Greens"" party with a strong focus on animal rights. Animals should be given basic animal rights; animals be protected; hunting be banned.

**PBC** (""Party of Bible-abiding Christians""): Right-wing evangelical party. Anti abortion and gay marriage. Diminishing of EU influence. Politics should be based on the values taught by the Bible. No EU for Turkey. 

**CM** (""Christian Middle - For a Germany Following God's Commandments""): Everything should be directed according to Christian values and God's commandments. Anti abortion. Pro discrimination of Muslims, as all of them are criminals and terrorists. 

**AUF** (""UP - Party for Labour, Environment and Family - Christians for Germany""). Wants an education salary for parents. Eurosceptical. Radical feminism and gay marriage are unchristian. 

**BüSo** (""Citizens' Rights Movement Solidarity""): Eurosceptic party that wants to build on ""Christian-humanist values"". Wants a new economic system (the current one is ""doomed"" to fail soon), a return to the D-Mark and nuclear power, and an abolition of the Lisbon Treaty. Criticised for having ""sectarian"" tendencies and a ""leader cult"". 

**DKP** (""German Communist Party""): Marxist / far-left extremist party. Eurosceptic. Anti-militarist. Debt relief for all poorer countries in the EU, while companies and banks have to pay for it. Minimum wages in the EU. The ultimate goal is communism/socialism. 

**PSG** (""Party for Social Justice, Section of the Fourth International""): Socialist party. Anti EU, austerity, capitalism &amp; militarism. Wants to solve the crisis by disowning banks, seizing of factories, controlling of companies and a general right to work.

**MLPD** (""Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany""): Far-left extremist parties that follows the teachings of ""Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Tse-tung"".

I'm definitely opposed to the military policies of both countries and I would be inclined to agree that Russia's behaviour has certainly been no worse than the United States' was in this particular context.  At least in the Russian case it was an active combat zone, the plane probably shouldn't have been there and Malaysia Airlines has some responsibility, though not the primary one.

In the case of Vincennes, we're talking about a state of the art 3D radar system with all of the information required to determine that the A300 was a civilian flight in an international corridor between two busy regional airports.  This system was run by trained naval officers and took place in peacetime.

In both cases it's almost certain that it was a genuine error rather than an intentional shoot down of a plane identified as an airliner.  The big difference is that we need to hold the US government to a higher standard that we do the Putin government when it comes to transparency and taking responsibility.  After all it is the worlds most powerful democratically governed nation and is supposed to always conform with the rule of law.

Thus far Putin hasn't said: ""I will never apologize for the Russia — I don't care what the facts are... I'm not an apologize-for-Russia kind of guy.""  Until he does I'm ok with saying that the incidents are roughly equivalent and the Russian response is no worse than the American response in 1988.

**privilègio s. m.** *[dal lat. privilegium, comp. di privus, nel sign. originario di «singolo, particolare», e lex «legge»; quindi propr. «disposizione che riguarda una persona singola»].*

*1. Nel diritto pubblico, atto sovrano o legge che attribuisce a un soggetto o a una categoria di soggetti una posizione più favorevole di quella della generalità degli altri soggetti; anche la posizione stessa, in sé considerata...*


**Esempio di privilegio nel campo del diritto (Wikipedia):**
*Il privilegio è una tra le cause di prelazione che costituisce garanzia patrimoniale su determinati beni del debitore in relazione alla causa del credito.*

Lo Stato ti puo' togliere la patente ed il privilegio di giuda. Possedere la patente non e' un diritto sancito dalla Costituzione Italiana e siccome e' un documento emanato dal Ministero Dei Trasporti, e' in se un privilegio che comporta alte responsabilita' civili, penali, e morali, nei confronti del titolare del documento di guida e verso seconde e terze persone.

&gt;  Sono i cittadini che danno in gestione allo Stato alcune risorse.

Puoi fornire un esempio?

&gt; Lo Stato si limita riconoscere i diritti, ovvero a non calpestarli, e dovrebbe riconoscerli tutti, altrimenti fa un torto.

E' un argomento diverso da quello della patente. I diritti sono quelli scritti sulla costituzione che vengono tutelati tramite leggi; poi si, ovviamente, lo Stato ha il dovere di rispettarli a 360 gradi.

That's actually not that strange: in fact, increasing productivity can cause wages to decrease.  What's interesting is demand relative to supply.

Let's say that society needs exactly 300 bricklayers, and I invent a machine that lets a man lay twice as many bricks.  Now I only need 150 bricklayers.  I now have 150 bricklayers that need to exit the market.  Wages will fall until a total of 150 bricklayers say ""the heck with this"" and leave that market.

Increasing productivity *can* cause wages to increase.  If I double someone's productivity and keep them doing the same thing, I halve labor costs to produce what they're making, all else held equal.  Given sufficient [price elasticity of demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand), there may be more people who want the good that I produce, so on the net, demand for my field of labor *might* increase.  For example, maybe there is *triple* the demand at the new, lower labor cost.  That will cause upward pressure on my wages.

&gt; Everyone in the West would be better off, in terms of real wages, if immigration, as well as outsourcing, was curbed.

Not necessarily, because immigration also increases demand for existing labor.

It's a reasonable bet that immigration of unskilled labor will put downwards pressure on wages for unskilled labor.  However, it likely puts upwards pressure on wages for skilled labor.

Additionally, placing limits on trade (as preventing outsourcing would do) means that you've a less-efficient market, and that tends to decrease the overall wealth of the society; it means that people are getting a share of a pie that is smaller overall.",null,0,null,1438225595,null,0,false,0,ctl4mt0,null,t3_3ewn1j,null,t1_ctl4mt0,null,t1_ctk5vxt,null,null,null,1440171317,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

I don't agree that it's sensationalist. They do as a matter of fact have Neo nazi roots (I did not say, nor did I mean to imply, that they are Neo Nazi now). Obsessed with immigrants is just a way of saying that they consider the solution to pretty much any issue to be reduced immigration. As far as I can tell that's also just factually describing their position.

I do think that Jimmie Åkesson being the main reason for their success (being charismatic, media savvy and a very good debater) is just fact.

&gt; In its constitution, UKIP describes itself as a ""democratic, libertarian party"".[96] Similarly, UKIP supporter James Delingpole characterised the party as ""patriotic, fiscally conservative, socially libertarian"".[97] Conversely, commentators writing in The Spectator, The Independent, and New Statesman have all challenged the description of UKIP as libertarian, highlighting its socially conservative and economically protectionist policies as being contrary to a libertarian ethos.[98]

Order by percentage 

**SPÖ:** Socialist Democratic Party, center-left. Represents mostly workers and their rights and social issues. Most popular in most cities, mildly popular everywhere else. One of the oldest parties.

**ÖVP:** People Party, center-right. Conservative party with great support from farmers and popular due to heavy investment programs. Christian-based and one of the oldest parties. Pro-EU.

**FPÖ:** Liberal Party, right. Started as a party for Nazis but isn't that extreme anymore. Some members are still active in extreme right wing groups, though. Very anti-immigrant, anti-EU and pro-Christian. Popular with low income workers and the youth. Every time they had been in power, heavy corruption occurred. They act like they represent low income workers while looking for tax reductions for the rich.

**Green Party:** Left wing. Their main topics are immigration, the environment, social problems and cannabis use. Only mildly popular due to some extreme positions and  proposed tax increases.

**Team Stronach:** Center. Liberal views and anti-EU. Not popular. Frank Stronach, an Austrian guy who made big money in Canada, founded the party and now wants his invested money back from the party.

* Your description flags the GOP as being associated with finance.  Last I looked, the Democratic Party had substantial links to finance, and a larger chunk of major contributors were from the finance world.  The Republican Party has adopted more policies, like tax breaks, that would be advantageous to the well-to-do, but it's not clear to me that they'd be affiliated with the finance industry.  Rather, I'd say that the main industry associated with the Republican Party be the oil industry.

* The Democratic Party really isn't [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) by any stretch of the imagination.

* This leaves out the small parties.  These are very weak, due to the structure of the political system, but they have occasionally gotten influence at a local level.  That includes the [Libertarian Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_Party_%28United_States%29), the [Green Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_the_United_States) and the even-smaller [Constitution Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Party_%28United_States%29); below that level, the parties pretty much [fade into the background noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_States).

**Latvia**

**Coalition parties**

* **Vienotība (Unity)**: Centre-right, initially formed as an electoral alliance between Jaunais Laiks (""New Era"", liberals both economically and socially, somewhat akin to US Democrats), Pilsoniskā Savienība (Civic Union, economic liberals, somewhat nationalist) and Sabiedrība Citai Politika (Society for Different Politics, centre left, least nationalist) to create a united right wing liberal force. During the last elections, they also absorbed some prominent members from the Reform Party. Very much pro-EU, sometimes even too much. One of the few parties that haven't been involved in major corruption scandals, although there have been some minor incidents. Popular among young, educated people living in population centres.
* **Zaļo un Zemnieku Savienība (Greens and Farmers Union)**: Centre and somewhat populist electoral alliance between Zemnieku Savienība (Farmers Union), Green Party and two regional parties. The official stance is pro-EU, but some prominent members are very much anti-EU, anti-NATO and pro-Russia, mostly because of business interests, but also to appear as more ""independent"". The Greens are not your ordinary Greens, as they are not left-wing as most European Green Parties are, and can be very ""anti-environment"" as soon as it hurts their business interests. Quite corrupt, especially the regional parties, and notorious for their ""conscience votes"" when the voting is not public, which basically means that they will vote with the opposition. Their Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs, and former Minister of Defence, now President Raimonds Vējonis are decent politicians, however. Popular among rural voters.
* **Nacionālā Apvienība (National Alliance)**: Right wing conservatives, initially formed as an electoral alliance between Tēvzemei un Brīvībai/LNNK (For Fatherland and Freedom/Latvian National Independence Movement, right wing conservatives) and Visu Latvijai! (Everything for Latvia!, nationalists). Conservative nationalists, economically liberal, although to a lesser extent than Unity. Just like with Greens and Farmers, the official stance is pro-EU, but there is a significant anti-EU sentiment among some of the members. Similarly, they have a history of sabotaging the coalition and voting with the opposition, although unlike Greens and Farmers they are rather open about it, and are using it to get more influence in the government. Not as corrupt as Greens and Farmers, but several high ranking members are accused of being involved in bankruptcy fraud schemes; they notoriously recalled their own Minister of Justice when he tried to address this problem.

**Opposition**

* **Sociāldemokrātiskā partija ""Saskaņa"" (Social Democratic Party ""Concord"")**: Nominally centre-left and desperately trying to pose as your friendly neighbourhood social democrats, but most of their left-wing proposals can be reduced to simple populism. Pro-Russian and pro-Putinist, although not strictly against EU. They regularly get the most votes in elections, but have never been in government because even suggesting it as a possibility means political death (see Reform Party). They have majority in Riga City Council, though, which is extremely corrupt. Their voter base is primarily Russians living in the big cities and eastern part of the country, and some people desperate to vote for a left-wing party that has a chance to get in the parliament.
* **Latvijas Reģionu Apvienība (Regional Alliance)**: A new party that was formed before the last elections by a number of people who are influential in the regions, with the goal of increasing their say in national politics. Nominally centrist, but their actual stance is yet to be seen. Popular outside of the capital, and among expats living in other EU countries.
* **No Sirds Latvijai (For Latvia from the Heart)**: ""One person"" party founded by the former State Auditor, Ingūna Sudraba. She had a good reputation while being the State Auditor, but their election campaign was marred by questionable sources of funding, and suspected links with Russian intelligence services.

**Other parties**

* **Reformu Partija (Reform Party)**: Founded by the former President Valdis Zatlers after he called for dissolution of the then current parliament. They won 22 seats in the 2011 election, making it the second largest party in the parliament, but quickly lost popularity after suggesting a possibility to include ""Concord"" in the coalition. Socially liberal and pro-EU, but advocating for a more Keynesian approach to economics. They did not participate in the 2014 election, but several of it's members stood for election together with Unity, with Edgars Rinkēvičs and Rihards Kozlovskis eventually retaining their seats in the subsequent government as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of the Interior, respectively. The party is currently in the process of being disbanded, which is sad, with many ex-members having joined either Unity or Regional Alliance.
* **Latvijas Krievu Savienība (Union of Russians in Latvia)**: Left wing party targeting Russian electorate. Ex-communists, pro-Russian, anti-EU and NATO, supporting the Russian annexation of Crimea and aggression in Easter Ukraine. They used to be very popular among Russian voters, but over time have lost it to the somewhat more moderate ""Concord"".
* **Latvijas Sociāldemokrātiskā Strādnieku Partija (Latvian Social Democratic Labour Party)**: One of the oldest parties, founded in 1918 (Farmers Union was founded in 1917), it used to be very popular and influential during the interbellum period, but gradually lost popularity after the restoration of independence, mostly due to internal conflicts, corruption in Riga City Council, Russian voters preferring the more extreme pro-Russian parties, and Latvians being afraid of anything that has the word ""social"" in it.
* **Latvijas Sociālistiskā Partija (Latvian Socialist Party)**: Essentially the Communist Party that is calling itself Socialist Party because the Communist Party is banned (silly, isn't it?)

In the 1960s, Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democratic president, passed the Civil Rights Act.  This had the federal government adopt policies that tended to promote racial equality.

This damaged the Democratic Party's support in the southern US, but gained it support in the north.

At the same time, the Republican Party adopted a [strategy to try to pull in southern white voters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy).  The two parties effectively swapped a significant chunk of their voter bases starting at this time.

The Americans *have logistics down to a science*. During the Libya campaign European warplanes dipped into American-NATO asset lockers for armaments, relied on American aerial refueling, and utilized American transport planes for goods and supplies. And Libya was a relatively simple mission close to home.

Logistics is as unglamorous as it is vital. It's a hard sell to the public, especially during times of budget cuts. Yet time and time again we see the importance of well-sorted logistics.

null,false,Flower_Fairy,UKGB,United Kingdom,null,"That was only one small aspect of my argument which I think might still stand without the section you've quoted, but still. I've seen similar surveys to these before. My opinion is that thoughts and opinions don't matter, only actions. Anyone is perfectly entitled to believe whatever they like in relation to how they should live their own life, up to the point where it affects other people.

If someone thinks an act, belief, orientation or whatever is immoral or abnormal they can choose to avoid it, without needing to believe other people should be forced to. It's mostly the latter position that I see as a problem, not the first. It's true I would probably want to criticise the belief and debate it when it was expressed, especially if it was based on factual errors. However I wouldn't consider it to necessarily be a problem if someone has a different point of view on the morality of any lgbt related issues. Despite what some groups might claim, I don't think many pro-lgbt people want to limit what people are allowed to believe.

&gt;These people hate gays, they don't see them has humans on an equal footing

This source does not support that claim. There is nothing here that suggests any muslims dehumanise gay people or necessarily want their rights eroded in any way. I have not seen any evidence (not just from you) that Muslims are any more likely than non-muslims to actively oppose/try to erode lgbt rights or abuse/attack lgbt people. Until I see that I'm going to see anything that claims to be pro-lgbt that specifically targets them as unwarranted, out of the blue and probably based on prejudice.

According to the voting intention found by that telegraph survey they're just as or perhaps more likely to want a more left wing government than the rest of the population. That's a statistic I've seen mirrored in other studies, some from the USA too I think. The fact they don't see lgbt or any other social issues important enough to warrant voting for a more socially conservative government implies that *as a demographic* they're not especially concerned about opposing lgbt rights, if they're opposed to them at all.

As for why I'm opposed to provoking them, it's not out of fear. It's out of the respect due to a group that doesn't seem to be especially opposed to lgbt rights, and because I think it would be counter-productive. From the conclusion of the Gallup source:

&gt;Since 9/11 and the terrorist attacks in Madrid and London, mistrust toward European Muslims has become palpable. Significant segments of European societies openly express doubt that Muslim fellow nationals are loyal citizens. The general construct of this premise rests on an oversimplified and erroneous understanding of Islam and terrorism. Muslims are often asked to demonstrate that they embrace the more liberal sexual values that exist in Europe to be considered full-fledged members of society, while overlooking that many other Europeans reject such values. Against this background, it is generally assumed that European Muslims cannot be trusted because of their perceived ambiguous allegiances and anachronistic values [...]

&gt;Integration is a complex, multi-dimensional process that occurs at a different pace for each individual. In Europe, there is already much common ground on which to base serious conversations about the integration of ethnic and religious minorities. European Muslims accept democratic institutions, justice, and human rights as the building blocks of their societies. However, while concerns about finding a job, feeding one’s family, and having access to good schools and good healthcare services are challenges that all European residents and citizens face, these issues are even more daunting for minorities. As the poll findings suggest, the economic marginalization of some European Muslims may have an impact on their well-being. This, in turn, creates psychological barriers that prevent them from becoming active members of their communities. As a result, the integration debate has to widen its frame, moving beyond the confines of security and religion, and focus more on the socioeconomic struggles of citizens of all faiths and no faith.

It would not be unreasonable for the people in the Muslim areas mentioned in the OP to feel they are being unfairly targeted. I would not want to support a group that tried to marginalise them in that way, I don't think it would do anything except exacerbate tensions. Which, like I said before, is what I think was probably the goal all along. I agree that ignoring the situation - in society as a whole - would probably make it worse. However I think the best way to address that is through trying to normalise being lgbt, cement lgbt rights and fight vocal critics or abusers. We have to start talking about lgbt issues somewhere (especially for political groups like the one in the OP), but that somewhere shouldn't be Muslims.

So now if Slovenia loses it mostly ""loses"" territory that Croatia already controls. Some people (like Joško Joras who build his house in Slovenia but now you claim he lives in Croatia) would be upset but at least it's settled and we can stop arguing.

But if Croatia loses then it needs to admit they controlled territory that wasn't theirs. And if the surveillance leaks tell the truth then Croatia will definitely lose something it currently controls (and we all know it eventually will) and that would make your government look really bad to it's voters. So I think it's clear that Croatia actually doesn't want this to be done any time soon. It's also been playing the nationalist card for a long time... which is understandable since nationalism always rises in failing economies and Croatia has always been much more nationalistic than Slovenia. But nationalism will only help incompetent politicians while having good relations with your neighbours will help your country.

And I'm not really sure why Croatia is so opposed to Slovenia having access to international waters. I think it's fair... but let the arbitration decide instead of dragging this on for 25 more years.

Pour ceux que ça intéresse, **la nouvelle extension de WoW sera révélée à la Gamescom le 6 aout à 18h**.

Source : https://twitter.com/Warcraft_FR/status/626437810485088256  

Grosse putain de hype, après un WoD désastreux, avec beaucoup trop de ""cut content"", un lore massacré, le boss de fin qui sort de nulle part et qui finit... de manière ambiguë ( cf le lore, et le lieu de sa mort en mythique )... bref, je vais pas tailler un costard à cette extension plus bas que terre. Mais fin MoP, ils ont annoncé avoir **DOUBLÉ** la team de développeurs, pour un résultat pitoyable jusqu'ici.  

Ça va *forcément* se retrouver maintenant, dans cette extension à venir. C'est obligé. Ils ne peuvent pas perdre encore 3m de subs en 3 mois avec un WoD bis. Ils *doivent* faire du grandiose irréprochable, c'est impératif. Ils sont attendus au tournant par l'ensemble de la communauté ( sauf les raideurs only, mais c'est une race à part ) !

Ils ont tout fait pour enterrer WoD le plus vite possible. J'espère que c'est juste une transition moisie vers la grosse extension à venir, qui servira aussi à poser les bases du film, sans cesse repoussé...   

  
Vos pronostics sur le thème abordé ? Pas mal de spéculations disent que le logo devrait être bleu... une extension marine ?  
Azshara / Mers du Sud / Tombe de Sargeras / Neptulon / restes de Zandalari / Tel'Abim / Kul'Tiras / Le 4ème DTA ( N'Zoth, et donc le Cauchemar d'Emeraude ? ) / le plan élémentaire de l'Eau.  
Sacré affiche, ça enverrait du putain de rêve !   

Sinon, dans la lignée de WoD ( qu'ils devraient nous faire oublier, donc mauvaise idée de leur part, mais bon... ) on pourrait avoir droit à un retour de la Légion, ou sur Azeroth, ou sur... Argus.   
Ça me fait pas bander du tout perso, l'extension marine est d'1) bien plus probable lore-wise 2) très demandée par les joueurs, ce serait un bon moyen de 3) nous faire oublier WoD et nous hyper au maximum, donc en sortant une extension qui sera massivement achetée, une extension marine impliquant Azshara et tout le reste cité plus haut. Et 4), facile de faire revenir la Légion, dont ils ont annoncé dans des interviews il y a un moment le retour à un moment donné, via Azshara et Sargeras.    
Pitié pas ""d'Army of Light"", prophétisée par Velen et Irion. Tout mais pas ça, je vous en supplie.

Peut-être un truc complètement nouveau ou presque. Ça a bien marché pour MoP, mais que pourraient-ils développer ? Les nérubiens ? Une autre race insectoïde ? [Franchement, je ne vois pas](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/f/f6/RacesChart.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100221125118).

Meanwhile, 3 paragraphs below

&gt; Nonostante le argomentazioni prodotte dalla Procura di Trani, nulla tra le carte trasmesse lascia intendere che il Sen. Azzollini voglia sottrarsi al giudizio, inquinare le prove o commettere nuovamente il reato di cui è accusato. Quindi, manca la stretta necessità di sottoporlo agli arresti domiciliari violandone la libertà personale e le prerogative di parlamentare. Il Senato, col suo voto, ha voluto dire questo

Ma hai mica appena detto che voi valutate solo se c'è ""parvenza/sospetto di persecuzione""? Ma dev' essere buona tanto la droga che ti passa il partito.

&gt; Infine, credo abbiano dato un contributo fondamentale a respingere l’autorizzazione contro Azzollini i due interventi in Aula dei senatori di 5 Stelle, addirittura eccezionali per demagogia reazionaria

La **demagogia reazionaria** attenzione attenzione, siamo a 10cm da **fascismo**

&gt; che hanno ottenuto il risultato di persuadere molti incerti e convincere tanti dubbiosi a votare in maniera esattamente opposta

Maledetti questi demagoghi con la loro coerenza, dovrebbero più invece seguire la mia logica di cui sopra, quella sì che spacca duro.

&gt; Insomma, anche questi ultimi, alla resa dei conti, hanno ritenuto che la limitazione della libertà, la pena e i processi non siano l’unico modo né il migliore **per tutelare l’etica pubblica, la sicurezza collettiva e gli interessi generali**

Amico ti devi un pochino decidere però, lo so che la coca fa questo effetto ma non è che puoi saltarmi di palo in frasca così. Cos'è che votavi allora, il fumus cippolippo, la necessità dei domiciliari o la tutela dell' etica pubblica?

&gt; There is a somewhat analogous situation with regard to the heterosexual seduction procedure in our Politically Correct times: the two sets, the set of PC behaviour and the set of seduction, do not actually intersect anywhere; that is, there is no seduction which is not in a way an ""incorrect"" intrusion or harassment — at some point, one has to expose oneself and ""make a pass."" So does this mean that every seduction is incorrect harassment through and through? No, and that is the catch: when you make a pass, you expose yourself to the Other (the potential partner), and she decides retroactively, by her reaction, whether what you have just done was harassment or a successful act of seduction — and there is no way to tell in advance what her reaction will be. This is why assertive women often despise ""weak"" men — because they fear to expose themselves, to take the necessary risk. And perhaps this is even more true in our PC times: are not PC prohibitions rules which, in one way or another, are to be violated in the seduction process? Is not the seducer’s art to accomplish this violation properly — so that afterwards, by its acceptance, its harassing aspect will be retroactively cancelled?

null,false,vortalwombat,HUNG,Hungary,null,"*I copy the translation here, if TL;DR: The article is not about numbers of attrocities commited by immigrants or something like that, it is about budget numbers.*

*The article proves that, based on the budget numbers in 2015 and 2016, the immigration is not handled by the Hungarian Government as a main problem nor even as a serious issue, the whole campaign is looks like a PR stunt to attract voters for the Fidesz and to stop the growth of the Jobbik's popularity. In the removed thread some agreed with this conclusion, some not.*

**10 numbers to illustrate how serious problem is the immigration according to the Hungarian Government**

""The question is now not only about how we Hungarians want to live in Europe, but about whether Europe remains what we know it today."" - said Viktor Orbán at Tusnádfürdő (Baile Tusnad) when he spoke about how Europe will have to face hundreds of millions of migrants in a few years. Based on the government's poster campaigns , the National Consultation on Immigration and Terrorism, recent Fidesz statements and the construction of the wall on the Hungarian-Serbian border; the government considers immigration as one of the most pressing problems of the country.

Let's not consider the fact that half to two-thirds of asylum seekers in a few days or a few weeks continue their way to Austria and Germany, or that there is no information on any offense, which had been committed by migrants in Hungary. Immigration - at least with this intensity in Europe - really is a serious problem.

But if the government really think that not only Western Europe but also Hungary is in trouble, do they spend a lot, in fact more and more money to solve this situation? The issue of immigration is managed by the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, for which the following sources were earmarked in the central budget in the last year, this year and next year's budget:

2014 : HUF 8.257 billion (EUR 27.5 million)

2015 : HUF 8.907 billion (EUR 29.7 million)

2016 : HUF 8.964 billion (EUR 29.9 million)

So next year we will spend nothing more on that despite the escalating migration pressure, while, for example, the budget of the Cultural Office of the Ministry of Human Resouces will increase from HUF 36.4 billion (EUR 121.5 million) to HUF 66.6 billion (EUR 222 million) next year.

In addition, HUF 2 billion (EUR 6.6 million) will go to this subject from the Refugee, Immigration and Integration Fund, which in large part, HUF 1.65 billion (EUR 5.5 million) is EU money, and there is nothing more in the budget about immigration/migration.

That is HUF 11 billion (EUR 36.7 million). But the government does not appear to mimic the Swedish model, Hungary would rather not take in any immigrants. What steps have been taken to achieve this other than sending policemen to the southern borders?

They planned HUF 6.5 billion (EUR 21.7 million) for the wall on the Hungarian-Serbian border. This should be ready by autumn and it's a one-time expenditure, so it seems the government will spend much less for that in the next year.

So according to the central budget and the budget of the fence - if we do not count here the inciting poster campaign which cost HUF 300 million (EUR 1 million) - the Hungarian Government will spend a total of approx. HUF 18 billion (EUR 60 million) on immigrants or against immigrants this year.

So that (...) goes for the biggest problem of the EU. On what kind of other urgent things the government spends such an astronomical sum?

* HUF 8.7 billion (EUR 29 million)

That is what the Central Bank spends on artifacts this year.

* HUF 9.4 billion (EUR 31.5 million)

The government would spend HUF 7.9 billion to the refurbishment of the Buda Castle by 2016, and 1.5 billion to the refurbishment of the [Carmelite Monastery](http://mandiner.hu/attachment/0091/90412_miniszterelnokseg.jpg), the future building of the Prime Minister's Office.

* HUF 9.5 billion (EUR 31.7 million)

That went to cover the loss of the Hungaroring this year (in the next three years HUF 25 billion will be spent to build a ""stadium like"" facility to replace the bleachers)(...).

* HUF 10.3 billion (EUR 34.4 million)

That ammount of money goes to the Hungarian Academy of Arts this year (5.2 billion) and to the National Film Fund (5.1 billion).

* HUF 11.6 billion (EUR 38.7 million)

That much for providing the budget to the [Palace of Arts](https://www.mupa.hu/en).

* HUF 14.5 billion (EUR 48.4 million)

That much public money goes to provide a warehouse for the Opera House.

* HUF 24.5 billion (EUR 81.7 million)

For now, (it looks like that it will be doubled in the next two years to HUF 49 billion) this much  will be spent for the 2017 World Championships for water sports.

* HUF 32.4 billion (EUR 108 million)

That much is spent on the National Media and Communications Authority.

* HUF 80.5 billion (EUR 268.4 million)

That much is spent this year on public television (MTVA).

* HUF Whoknowshowmuchand 10 billions

According to the plan in a few years HUF 183 billion (EUR 610 million) would spent on stadiums, although the plan ended up in chaos, that is for sure, that much more money will be spent on the Hungarian football, which drowned into total disinterest, than to immigration.

The ratios are shown in the following charts(...) lots of money go even in such niceties as the National Strategic Research Institute (HUF 1.2 billion), the Veritas Institute (HUF 260 million), the Design Terminal (HUF 600 million), Hungary Initiatives Foundation (HUF 600 million), PM Viktor Orban's protocol (HUF 500 million), government communications (HUF 1.1 billion), etc.

So when the government prattles all day long about the immigration as the biggest problem of the Western civilization, and about how Hungary is ready to act, it is enough to look at the budget to find out, are there any serious, thoughtful plans on the side of the government or they simply take advantage of a PR opportunity.",null,0,null,1438241167,null,0,false,0,ctlb4dn,null,t3_3ewn1j,null,t1_ctlb4dn,null,t1_ctk61cg,null,null,null,1440174441,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Russia is treated like any other country that isn't the US. It is more fucked up than average, so it gets criticized more than average, it's just fair. The correct response is to start fixing shit, and not to complain and bully neighbors.

USA is the only remaining superpower, it gets to do things that others can't. Yes it's unfair. Still it doesn't mean Russia should be allowed to invade and annex without consequences.

And BTW USA was heavily criticized for the Iraq and still is. And it haven't annexed any part of it, and backed away since.

Currently the passport checks for the channel crossings are set up in an unusal way, where both exit and entry requirements are checked before boarding the transport. Usually each country handles their own entry or exit checks only.

France could get rid of having UK entry passport and visa checks in France - and it could allow anyone to exit France (since their further destination is not their concern). Then the migrants would get on ferries, arrive in Dover, will refuse to get on the ferry back, and generally become the UK's problem.

I've actually not run into that very often at all. It seems like there are far more cases of people complaining about the use of the term ""racist"" than there are people actually using the term inappropriately, recently at least. In fact, I'd say it's becoming quite difficult to even call actual cases of racism racism any more, because you'll immediately be accused of ""calling different opinions racist"".

&gt; There are people who say ridiculous things like that we should completely open the borders and let absolutely everyone who wants to move here in or that nations are a construct without any meaning or promote communism etc. These in my opinion are as empty and non contributing to any discussion as saying ""brown people are all criminals"".

I generally agree that most of those are empty and non contributing, although I again I have to point out that these opinions are extremely rare. As someone who isn't a fan of nation states, I haven't exactly noticed many like-minded people on this subreddit (assuming /r/europe demographics is what we're discussing here, not exactly clear on that). 

&gt; I could probably name dozens who you see in most immigration related threads, who strongly support the current immigration policies.

This, on the other hand, is quite different to promoting the idea of open borders. Let me try to explain this ""support"", from my perspective at least. I support the current immigration policies. The reason I support them is not that I *like* the current form of immigration that we have. Even though I'm generally a supporter of multiculturalism, I recognize that the current immigration trends are not going to lead to any sort of a melting pot effect in Europe. The kind of immigration that we have now is actually highly counter-productive in that context. So I would certainly *prefer* the mass immigration to stop, or for it to be contained somehow.

The reason that preference isn't enough for me to support most ideas coming from the anti-immigration camps is that I have different *priorities* which I base my political opinions on. My two absolute priorities that formulate my opinion on every policy are human rights and individual freedom. So when the majority of proposals to limit immigration go against my priorities in favor of someone else's priorities (such as religious unity, social cohesion, family values, etc), it goes without saying that I'm not going to support them. If someone comes up with a solution that satisfies *my* priorities, I will have no problem supporting them. 

This position, while rarely articulated, is what I believe is the position of (still) the majority of people in Europe. It's not that anyone is delighted by what's happening, it's that all the problems immigration creates are simply judged to be not as severe as the core problems that some of the proposed solutions would bring. 

While more people might be getting concerned, I think a lot of people may be confusing concern with committed support for the more radical ideas in tackling immigration. People react to day-to-day events. If Europe were to cause a major international incident plus a humanitarian disaster by deporting masses of people to Libyan coast, for example, there would be an almost instant swing in popular opinion.

null,false,VorisBian,cocarde,Cocarde,null,"&gt; Je comprends le but de la question (sur les relations entre pays dans l'imaginaire collectif), mais d'un point de vue purement pragmatique ça n'a aucune valeur sur l'amitié entre les peuples ou une histoire de réconciliation. Il y a plein de raisons pour lesquelles la guerre conventionnelle n'est pas possible matériellement entre la France et l'Allemagne ...

Sauf que le ""*point de vue pragmatique*"", que je partage sur un certain nombre de sujets, n'est pas applicable à ce niveau. La mémoire collective et subjective est essentielle. Les raisons matérielles ne sont pas les seuls facteurs explicatifs qui expliquent non seulement l'impossibilité, mais également l'absurdité d'une guerre entre la France et l'Allemagne : les relations économiques, les relations politiques, la participation aux alliances militaires, etc. Je pense qu'une guerre, en tout cas en Europe occidentale, est une hypothèse aujourd'hui farfelue, qui n'a plus aucun sens depuis 1945.

&gt; ... et l'opinion publique peut très vite être changée sur ce genre de sujets, avec un peu de propagande bien faite (du genre l'hystérie collective des média sur Poutine en ce moment).

L'opinion publique peut être manipulée, mais il ne faut pas sur-estimer sa naïveté. Il ne s'agit pas d'un corps monolithique, et le terme en lui-même ne signifie rien. Parle-t-on des sondages, dont la représentativité est somme toute limitée, des micro-trottoirs, etc. ? Pierre Bourdieu s'est attaqué à ces préconceptions bien pratiques mais beaucoup trop simplistes. Contrairement à des périodes plus anciennes, manipuler la manipulation des médias n'est plus aussi efficace. Alors évidemment, il existe des tendances de fond, mais le traitement de la crise ukrainienne en France ne diffère pas fondamentalement de celle au Royaume-Uni ou en Espagne. Mais de là à retrouver une campagne de presse digne de l'été 1914, non.

&gt; Je n'ai pas étudié la question précisément, tu aurais des sources stp ? En lisant les articles wikipedia c'est assez difficile de voir ce qui est dû aux restructurations (passage d'une économie dirigée à une économie libéralisée) et ce qui serait dû aux institutions européennes (avec en particulier que les dizaines de milliards d'aide à la Pologne).

D'après les chiffres de la [Banque mondiale](https://www.google.gr/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:POL:HUN:DEU:EST:FRA:LVA:LTU&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=838674000000&amp;tend=1406667600000&amp;hl=fr&amp;dl=fr&amp;ind=false), mais Eurostat peut te fournir des résultats similaires, des pays comme la Lituanie, l'Estonie, la Lettonie ou la Pologne ont connu 3 à 6 points de croissance du PIB en plus par rapport à la France ou l'Allemagne sur la période 2007-2015. Si on remonte au début des années 2000, début de la période d'intégration de ces pays, qui ont adopté graduellement l'acquis communautaire et la législation européenne, le constat est similaire. N'oublions pas l'effet des fonds tels que le FEDER au niveau des infrastructures.

&gt; Pas d'accord avec toi là-dessus. Les révolutions de couleur ont commencé en 2003, avec toujours la même chronologie : des ""ONG"" financées (à coup de millions de dollars) par des Américains assurent la formation de groupes de manifestants qui vont déstabiliser le pouvoir en place.

Le financement d'ONGs par des puissances étrangères n'est absolument pas un scandale. Des millers d'ONG en Europe sont financées par des fondations américaines, parfois proches du Parti Républicain ou Démocrate. C'est une manière d'accroître le *soft power* d'un pays efficacement. La CIA peut tirer les ficelles, mais ce ne serait pas une nouveauté. Dans l'histoire, des partis politiques ou des journaux ont régulièrement été financés par des pays étrangers, je pense notamment aux Partis communistes lors de la Guerre Froide. Les Instituts culturels, comme les Instituts Français, Goethe, Cervantes, Confucius, les financements des Consultats aux activités culturelles s'inscrivent dans la même stratégie. Cela étant dit, loin de défendre la stratégie américaine dans la matière, la manière d'agir de Washington est nettement préférable à celle de Moscou, indéfendable, qui consiste à employer la manière forte pour contraindre ses voisins.

&gt; L'élément déclencheur des troubles, ce sont les États-Unis, pas la Russie.

C'est la poule ou l'oeuf? L'oeuf ou la poule? Les réponses simples aux problèmes complexes sont rarement les meilleures.

&gt; ... Euh comparé à l'interventionnisme américain, aux révolutions de couleur, à l'établissement de bases militaires et à l'envoi de soldats américains à côté des Russes ça n'est pas grand chose.

L'interventionnisme américain existe depuis la création même des Etats-Unis. Ils n'ont jamais été véritablement isolationnistes, et même lorsqu'ils le prétendaient, ils ne se privaient pas pour intervenir en Amérique Latine, ou pour participer à des conférences internationales, pour s'installer dans des comptoirs en Chine, etc. L'établissement des bases militaires, le soutien financier à des mouvements politiques étrangers, l'envoi de soldats un peu partout à travers le monde, ce n'est pas nouveau. Il ne faut pas faire la vierge effarouchée à ce niveau-là. La participation d'un pays à l'OTAN implique plus ou moins la présence de forces de l'alliance sur son territoire, et comme les Etats-Unis sont les principaux contributeurs, et que les nouveaux entrants sont les plus actifs, il n'est guère étonnant que des bases s'installent facilement chez leurs alliés. Les américains sont beaucoup plus soignés dans leur stratégie que les russes, dont les chars ont laissé de très mauvais souvenirs chez les anciens pays du Pacte de Varsovie.

Relativiser les actions de la Russie à travers les conneries des américains est une absurdité absolue. Washington et l'Administration Bush sont inexcusables pour leur politique étrangère. Mais ce n'est pas parce qu'ils ont fait n'importe quoi qu'on va accepter sur la Russie fasse ce qu'elle veut à ses frontières, en envahissant ses voisins, en leur mettant des coups de pression, etc. Le relativisme dans les relations internationales, c'est du *bullshit*.

&gt; Euh... tu veux qu'on parle de l'ingérence américaine en Géorgie ? Qu'est-ce qu'ils viennent foutre là-bas sérieusement ? Où est le respect de l'Europe ?

A cette période, la Géorgie de Mikheil Saakachvili est pro-UE et pro-OTAN. T'Bilissi se rapproche des deux institutions, et ses partenaires européens semblent être enclins à accepter de passer à la vitesse supérieure sur le dossier géorgien. Moscou a décidé de faire capoter le projet en alimentant les mouvements séparatistes d'Ossétie et d'Abkhazie, déjà très actifs, puis en envahissant la Géorgie pour la désarmer au nom de la protection de ses alliés. De deux choses l'une : il s'agit d'une agression d'un Etat souverain ; il s'agit d'une ingérence dans les affaires intérieures d'un Etat. Tu me parles de respect de l'Europe, je te parle de respect du droit international et de la souveraineté des Etats.

&gt; L'Ukraine est justement le cas typique : une destabilisation manquée des Américains en 2004, alors on passe par un proxy (l'UE) pour recommencer le travail avec Maïdan (là aussi largement financée par des ""ONG"" américaines et profitant en plus des rivalités entre oligarques).  N'oublions pas non plus que l'UE et la Russie étaient en compétition sur les traités de libre échange (d'ailleurs quel est l'intérêt de la France là-dedans?), et que c'est la Russie qui a fait la meilleure offre. Les troubles ne sont venus qu'une fois que l'accord européen a été rejeté, dans un pays très divisé entre sa partie orientale et sa partie occidentale.

Bruxelles n'est pas le pion de Washington. C'est déjà suffisamment le bordel entre européens, il est erroné de croire que les américains parviennent à contrôler, ou en tout cas, à influencer directement la politique européenne de manière aussi importante. L'Ukraine, par situation géographique, sa démographie, son économie, son histoire, est le dernier candidat crédible à l'entrée dans l'UE, en attendant que la situation se stabilise dans les Balkans (la Turquie, c'est trop compliqué pour le résumer en une phrase). C'est dans l'intérêt des européens de s'étendre, pour étendre le marché commun, et pour l'Ukraine, c'est pareil. L'Union européenne, c'est 500 millions de consommateurs. La Russie, c'est mmoins de 140 millions. Avec des pouvoirs d'achat très différents. La France a autant d'intérêt à investir en Ukraine qu'en Iran : du moment qu'on peut faire de l'argent, on ne va pas cracher dessus.

&gt;&gt;That's actually not that strange: in fact, increasing productivity can cause wages to decrease.
&gt;
&gt; In the short term, but it should actually raise the equilibrium price of labor as automation / etc. incentivizes people to pursue education and go into higher-paying, knowledge-based jobs.

I agree that in the long run, there will be a tendency to return, because part of what depresses wages in the scenario I described is inertia from existing workers in the field that just underwent automation.

If there are no other factors preventing people from going into those higher-paying knowledge-based jobs, yes, I'd expect the average of all wages across the board to increase.  That being said...if we can only successfully impart the skills to do those jobs to a portion of society, that won't happen.  The fact that the [pay gap between a college graduate and a high school graduate in the US is widening](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/upshot/is-college-worth-it-clearly-new-data-say.html?_r=0) (I apologize for using the US as an example, but I know this one off the top of my head) would be consistent with an inability to move more labor into those more-skilled fields, however.

&gt;&gt; Increasing productivity can cause wages to increase. If I double someone's productivity and keep them doing the same thing, I halve labor costs to produce what they're making, all else held equal. Given sufficient price elasticity of demand, there may be more people who want the good that I produce, so on the net, demand for my field of labor might increase. For example, maybe there is triple the demand at the new, lower labor cost. That will cause upward pressure on my wages.
&gt;
&gt; Whoops, this is wrong. You're saying you halved your labor costs and, in doing so, tripled demand; this increases your revenue by 50% (I guess you have some sort of a logarithmic demand curve). How do you think this might put upward pressure on your wages? 

Because I can now profitably employ more workers than I did before.  Wages will tend to rise until it's no longer profitable for more workers to be employed in this position.

&gt; &gt; Not necessarily, because immigration also increases demand for existing labor.
&gt;
&gt; It can, but unfortunately 1) that demand is being captured by business owners, not practitioners in the West right now and 

I don't see why owners of business in particular would need benefit.  Heck, let's imagine that hypothetically, every immigrant is dead-set on operating their own small business -- maybe it's a status symbol to do so back home.  That would tend to hurt other business owners.

As for workers seeing benefits, let's say that none of the people coming in are qualified to be dentists, and a disproportionately-small chunk of them become dentists.  Wages for dentists will then tend to rise.

&gt; 2) it's also offset by higher crime rates, lower overall performance in schools, higher intensity usage of public services and infrastructure that can't easily be enlarged / strengthened, etc.

Surprisingly-enough, at least in the US, [the foreign-born](http://openborders.info/hispanic-crime-and-illegal-immigration-in-the-united-states/) commit crime at a substantially lower rate than the native born.

You're right that I wasn't trying to take into account additional welfare costs (though I'm not sure what infrastructure you're thinking of that can't easily be enlarged), and I suppose that that could be important.

&gt; &gt; Additionally, placing limits on trade (as preventing outsourcing would do) means that you've a less-efficient market, and that tends to decrease the overall wealth of the society; it means that people are getting a share of a pie that is smaller overall.
&gt;
&gt; I said people in the West.

I may have been unclear -- the ""pie"" that I was referring to was in the society that was outsourcing, not the union of the two.  Each individual society will benefit due to [comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage).

C'est un bon outil, même si la tendance de fond est à plus de poids et d'influence des gros sites (et plus de flicage, haha!). L'internaute lambda est désormais un consommateur et plus un créateur. Petit à petit on tombe dans les mêmes travers que les médias de masse.

Concrètement, créer une télévision libre, c'est hyper compliqué, à cause du coût du matériel, et des démarches pour acquérir le droit d'émettre. En radio c'est déjà plus simple, et il y a des tonnes de radio associatives géniales, des radios pirates aussi parfois. Des journaux ou magazines, ou fanzines libres, c'est répandu, et finalement il y en a aussi quelques uns sur internet, mais [ils sont parfois attaqués par la justice](https://iaata.info/REPRESSION-DES-MEDIAS-LIBRES-TOUCHE-D-ESPOIR-ET-SOUTIEN-A-IAATA-756.html) , tout comme les journalistes indépendants [qui ne sont pas protégés par une carte de presse](http://www.taranisnews.com/post/123641407843/un-photographe-de-taranisnews-perquisitionn%C3%A9-%C3%A0) .

Donc les médias libres, ils existent. Ils pourraient être encore plus nombreux, mais le problème n'est pas tant leur discrétion que l'hégémonie des médias de masses. Ces derniers captent encore l'essentiel de l'attention des personnes qui s'informent grâce à eux. En plus on assiste sans cesse à des mouvements de fusions/acquisitions, ces médias sont de plus en plus concentrés, et perdent le peu d'originalité qui les différenciaient.

Well I think if you want to regain the german one again, you will have to go through all the requirements that everybody else has, yes. But also you will definitely only be able to keep one.

One of the reasons I find this subject interesting is a client of mine is a UK based business, focused on servicing Africans living in the UK.

However, the business has a French name and is almost split down the middle between an English and French speaking client base. When I asked him about the reasons, he said that previous generations of immigrants to France from (primarily) west Africa, give feedback on how utterly shit the French treat immigrants, how they are boxed into neglected ghettos and harassed by police constantly etc etc...

And so, the trend is to come to Britain (and other northern european nations too like the Norway surprisingly) because, granted, while not perfect, they have a chance to live a better life...

Bare in mind, my feedback is only related to French speaking west africans, but I can imagine that feedback is similar elsewhere.

However, the flip of this is

1) People in the UK think that because immigrants want to come to the UK, that we are too soft...

2) The French treat immigrants so appallingly, that in effect, immigrants are choosing the UK now as refugees from the country they 'legally' would be most likely to seek refuge in. 

TLDL: Based on a sample feedback, France treats immigrants like shit and as such they want to come to Britain. 

1) Should Britain be chastised for not accepting them, or 
2) Should the French start to change the way they approach human rights, or 
3) Should Britain start to copy the French and treat immigrants like shit on a shoe and get them to aim for elsewhere.",null,0,null,1438243473,null,0,false,0,ctlbr6u,null,t3_3f4s8y,null,t1_ctlbr6u,null,t1_ctlb265,null,null,null,1440174739,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

I will use a 3 dimensional model(yay!) to evaluate every party, being the axes economic policy, social model and territoral model.

* PP [Popular Party]. It's the current ruling party. It was founded by some francoist ministers (the most progressive of them, which is not to say a lot). They have governed Spain from 1996-2004 and in 2011-2015. Currently they are involved in uncountable corruption scandals.

  * Economic policy: Liberal(allegedly but they embrace nationalistic  protectionism where they can).

  * Social model: Very Conservative. They have opossed to divorce, abortion and  homosexual marriage laws, but they haven't derogated any of them.

  * Territorial model: Originally centralist, but since the current territorial 
  model seems irreversible they have embraced it.

* PSOE[Socialist and Worker's Spanish Party]. Social Democrats. They have governed Spain from 1982-1996 and 2004-2011. In the 90's they had their fair share of corruption scandals. They lost a lot of support due how they handled the crisis.
  
  * Economic policy: Social Democrat.

  * Social model: Progressive. They have promulgated the abortion, divorce and homosexual marriage laws.  One of the most critizised ones was the law against ""gender violence"".

  * Territorial model: Originally they defended the current, autonomies based, territorial model. Now they argue for transforming it in a true  federal model, whatever it means.
  
* Podemos[We Can]. A new party, born from the social movements that protested against the austerity measures and the political corruption. Its leader,  Pablo Iglesias, became famous debate shows in TV. They are allegedly a transversal movement but most of its members have been in left or far left organizations.

  * Economic policy: Unknown. Originally anticapitalistic, but since they went up in the polls they claimed it to be ""nordic social democrat"".

  * Social Model: Progressive.

  * Territorial Model: Federalised(I guess). They argue for including the right for  self determination of territories in the Constitution.

* Ciudadanos[Citizens](Disclaimer, this is my preferred option by now). They are a party born in Catalonia in 2006 as a response to catalan nationalism and traditional spanish parties(PP and PSOE). It claims to focus in the citizen rights in contrast to territories rights. Last year, after a failed alliance with another centrist party, they decided to concur to elections out of Catalonia. They formed aggrupations in all Spain in record time, which means that lots of their candidates are pretty bad.
  
  * Economic policy: Liberal (allegedly since they haven't governed anywhere)

  * Social Model: Progressive. They have opened some interesting debates  about drug decriminalization and prostitution legallization.

  * Territorial Model: Federalist, but they critics say that's centralist,  since argue for a tight control of the states finances.
  
* Izquierda Unida[United Left]. Those are mostly the old school communists. 
They were the ones who more strongly fought the dictatorship, but after it 
couldn't capitalize those sacrifices.
  
  * Economic policy: Anticapitalistic in theory, we don't know what they would apply in practice.

  * Social Model: Progressive.

  * Territorial Model: Federalist since the start.

* PNV[Basque nationalistic Party] Originally an ethnic-based and ultracatholic party, now it's a much more moderate right wing party. They strived strongly for independence a decade ago, but now, without explicitelly renouncing to it,they focus more on using and preserving basque territories historical rights.

   * Economic policy: Liberal inside the Basque Country, but protectionist with the outside.

   * Social Model: Moderately conservative.

   * Territorial Model: They don't care, as long it preserves their rights.

* Catalan Nationalistic Parties. Just now they are a mess, and a category on their own. Look into other posts for information.

In short it comes down to them promising things they can't deliver, doing stuff so that they can't possibly deliver and making stupid mistakes such as bringing this to a vote while knowing that Russia will veto it and by doing so, putting it off the table. That's the short of it.


Here's a short list of things they've done:
-Promise to deliver to parlement a 'strategy of how to get things done'. The strategy didn't come and when a member of parlement requested for it in a motion, he was voted away by the government parties. The PM Rutte has promised to 'bring the guilty to justice, return the bodies of the victims and bring the truth of it all to light'. He ain't showing it here.

-The government has kept vital information away from parlement at least once, but maybe more often. Who knows? Well, we know that the Germans shared vital intel on who fired the BUK rocket at flight MH17 and that the Dutch government then refused to share it with the members of parlement. There was a debate on this, but not in the main parlement room, but in a backroom and for some reason this debate wasn't put up on the state's tv website where you can watch back all the debates and discussions (the horror). Ok..  (https://twitter.com/PieterOmtzigt/status/593042462886748160/photo/1)

-The government knew that the 'separatists' had anti-air missiles, but the government refuses anyone access to the documents stating so as 'they might damage diplomatic relations'. Read: damage us as we could and should've warned the flying companies.

-The Dutch government brings the question to a vote at the UN. This might seem logical, but when you know beforehand that a member of the security, Russia, will 100% veto it, why would you then do this? It ends all diplomacy regarding the matter between Russia and the Netherlands and takes away a card you could've played later. To the unwary it might seem as if Russia is the bad guy, but the government is literally washing its hands clean so that it can now say 'look, we tried, sorry'. 


Oh and did I mention that the Dutch government knowing of the BUK rockets, being aware of the threat to planes, makes them liable to responsibility with regards to claims? This shit stinks from top to bottom and having seen our government handle this has left me feeling disgusted. Pretending to act like you care and will do everything you can, doing everything so you have to take zero responsibility and basically doing nothing but pointing a finger at Russia while saying as little as possible. 

Our government hasn't taken a strong stance. They've done the reverse: mimic a strong stance, but do as little as humanly possible. Australia, they took a strong stance under Tony Abbott.

Christliche Quellen dieser Art sind nicht wissenschaftlich und deswegen abzulehnen. Zum warum:

Seriöse wissenschaftliche Arbeit unterliegt immer der Bedingung der Falsifizierbarkeit. Eine Theorie wird aufgestellt und sie funktioniert nach dem überprüfen oder sie wird falsifiziert. Dann kann die Theorie überarbeitet oder verworfen werden wenn das Anpassen keinen Sinn macht. Das ist wissenschaftlich Arbeiten. Das ist mit der Religion, hier mal als Beispiel das Christentum, als Theorie nicht machbar. Die Theorien sind mal stärker mal schwächer mit der Religion verknüpft bzw. im Christentum sogar direkt mit der Bibel verknüpft. Das würde bedeuten das bei einer Falsifizierung und der Ablehnung der Theorie die Bibel bzw. diese Bibelstelle abgelehnt werden müsste. Das wird nicht gemacht da sonst die Bibel fehlbar wäre und man sich nicht darauf verlassen könnte ob der Rest auch stimmt. Die Bibel hätte keinen Absolutheitsanspruch mehr und somit auch Gott nicht mehr. Es kann nicht sein, was nicht sein darf. Die Falsifizierbarkeit ist nicht mehr gegeben.

Es ist also keine Wissenschaft die betrieben wird. Also lehne ich sie ab.

* The MH17 crash can't be classified as a threat to world peace and security (according to russia), which means chapter VII is not applicable

The USA shot Iran Air plane, Ukraine shot russian plane (my comment: yeah that happened, military training failure, in 2001 or something, and it is probably one of the most shameful episodes of history of Ukraine military, but the difference is, Ukraine admitted it, apologized and paid compensations).

Not at all, if you're speaking Catalan. What's hard to grasp is why you insist that people use the Catalan version even in other languages. That's pretty authoritarian (and silly, but then so are all forms of nationalism).

null,false,wadcann,UNSA,United States of America,null,"So, here's what I'm getting at.  The US could just fly a couple planes in and blow up the artillery or tanks and whatnot.  The Javelins might be more-economical.  I would be pretty comfortable in the US winning in a Russia-US proxy war, much less a Russia-US+EU proxy war.

But Russia, in turn, is not going to like this, and it's not a static entity that just sits there like a lump and watches what is happening to it.  Russia can be expected to respond, and the Russian public to react.

If the United States had a country fund attacks on *it*, it would probably respond in some way.  My guess is that pretty much any country would do the same.

There are a lot of reactions that might happen.  I don't claim that any of these *will* happen, but I can think of a couple drawbacks.

The ideal from a US standpoint would (I assume; I've no special insight into what the US government wants) be to have Russia withdraw support for separatism in Ukraine, the separatist regime to relatively-peacefully fall apart, and for the country to re-knit under Kiev.  Certainly, at the end of the day, having a relatively-stable environment would be good.

That means that Russia backing down more-or-less peacefully would be the best outcome.

If you've just killed off a lot of Russia's soldiers, now you've got an upset Russian public, and the Russian leadership in a position where backing down -- what the US would like to have happen -- may be more politically-damaging to the Russian leadership.  They've now got an incentive to do things that visibly-to-their-public harm you.  That's not a situation that's advantageous to you.  Military failure and humiliation in the [Russo-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War) and [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) helped destroy the tsars, and it probably wouldn't be very healthy for another leadership either.  So now you've created an incentive for the Russian government to do the opposite of what you want.

Russia may feel the need to try and demonstrate that killing its soldiers has costs, and itself escalate.  Yeah, it isn't going to win a straight-up conventional war.  Maybe it decides that it needs to make *sure* that Ukraine stays trashed and starts throwing money at destabilizing Ukraine -- Kiev, not just the eastern and southern bits.  Maybe it decides to engage in any of the other myriad of other things that it might do to make life more-difficult for the West.

It might be that Russia will simply start feeding weapons back in, does airstrikes, and the war turns hotter: Ukraine gets trashed, a lot more refugees get produced.

One other possibility: it could be that the US State Department is comfortable with the prospect of a Russia-created partition in terms of opposing Russia as a long-term project.  Russia is the aggressor, chops up the country, threatens the rest, further advance is blocked, side that isn't under Russia does a lot better economically and acts as a really-compelling reason to split away from Russia for everyone else under Russia.  It happened before with East/West Germany and the North/South Korea splits, and less-directly with places like Finland and Estonia.  That isn't very satisfying in terms of immediate return of the land, though if you've got it in for Russia, that might be one of the most-meaningful long term political actions against Russia.  A hot war that Ukraine wins might actually be disadvantageous.  The US started off early with economic and civil actions, like funding police reform in Ukraine and sanctioning Crimea, and in making military demands of Russia that would simply render the situation static, which I suppose would be compatible with this sort of thing.

No, I don't know what all will happen.  And I'm not saying that it would be a *bad* idea to send over the weapons or even that the political costs *would* dominante.  I'm not saying that I'm opposed to sending in weapons.  I'm just saying that, at least in theory, the political costs of an military escalation could greatly-exceed the costs of the weapons themselves: it might be worth considering that cost.

For Poroshenko, I assume that the goal here is not merely a $100M handout, but drawing other governments into military alignment with Ukraine: once there's a commitment, it's easier to rely on ongoing to support, and it becomes increasingly-politically-difficult for the US or EU leadership to simply stand back.",null,0,null,1438245466,null,0,1438278194,0,ctlc9ke,null,t3_3f268q,null,t1_ctlc9ke,null,t1_ctlbntp,null,null,null,1440174980,null,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12,null

The (pro-)Russian side *already thinks* the 'Nazi Junta' in Ukraine is a puppet regime of the US  installed by the US and their narrative is that the US is already engaged with boots on the ground, CIA operatives and military hardware. Sure Russia might react in the way you describe but there's no way they could explain that reaction to the (pro-)Russian people because nothing will have changed for their propaganda narrative if the US really does get involved in whatever way.

If the opposition already insists you're doing something then what's the harm in actually starting to do that thing? They've kind of fucked themselves with their own propaganda and that might be an angle to use that against them...

Furthermore they're still denying involvement and denouncing Russian casualties. As far as they're concerned the Russian military is not involved so they can't officially get hurt by the conflict.

The nation needed international help to barely survive. If Ukraine didn't give the nukes up we would have gone hardball on their ass. Either by undermining their weak government or letting them collapse and having Russia take the weapons.

They may be considered as conservative leftists, but they are nowhere near united. Prime minister said no to immigrants, their EP MPs wanted immigrants etc.

**Opossition**

**SDKU-DS** - Once overthrown Meciar (Putin like bad guy), brought us to Nato and EU, now lying in trash and most likely wont be elected next year. Mix of everything

**KDH** - Conservative party attracting religious voter. They ruined coalition because of threaty with Vatican, they wanted to abolish abortion etc... Some of the best members left for new parties and just hard core is left.

**SAS** - Do you remember Nigel Farrage shouting about new quote of crysis in EP? He quoted Richard Sulik, leader of this party. Those guys are pretty liberal, on the other side, still respect our national opinion, traditions etc. Maybe i would call them nationalistic liberal. They are ok with weed, aggainist nacism from EU or immigrants.

**OLANO** - It isnt possible to be just independent here. You have to have party. Many people just want to get into politics, without being discredited by party. This is the party for it. They are one big heterogennous mass lead by narcistic guy.

**Most-Hid** - Multinational party. Mainly for Slovak Hungarians, on the other side, gets many votes from Slovaks, Ukranians etc. living here. Lead by nonconflictous politician Bela Bugar. Would describe it as conservative right.

**Interesting non parlament parties:**

**SMK** - Most-Hid counterpart, more militant Hungarian party.

**Siet** - Lead by ex-KDH member, trying to be conservative right wing with many new ideas and trying to bring new wind in politics. Financed by its leader and members. Next year, there will be their first votes and its likely, that they will get 12-20 percents.

**LS-NS** - Bunch of ultranationalistic/nazi elements.

**SNS** - Traditional party, got rid of alcoholic called Jan Slota, now it may be prosperous, new leader is lawyer in not so prosperous region, who can see many problems.

**SKOK** - Lead by ex SAS member, talking mainly about bussiness problems. May be interesting in connection with Siet.",null,0,null,1438246180,null,0,false,0,ctlcftg,null,t3_3f1u3r,null,t1_ctlcftg,null,t3_3f1u3r,null,null,null,1440175061,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Under Stalingrad.

Per esempio, il presidente della repubblica controlla legislativo (sciogliere le camere, rimandare le leggi indietro una volta), esecutivo (approva la scelta dei ministri) e giudiziario (è a capo del CSM). Il legislativo controlla il presidente della repubblica tramite la messa in stato d'accusa e la possibilità di votare una legge due volte; controlla inoltre l'esecutivo perché può togliergli la fiducia, e il giudiziario perché può approvare leggi che lo riguardano.

Il giudiziario ovviamente controlla legislativo ed esecutivo facendo il suo lavoro. Ma chi ha il potere giudiziario può fare una cosa che gli altri _non_ possono fare. Il parlamento non può impedire all'esecutivo di fare il suo lavoro (il presidente della Repubblica presumibilmente scioglierebbe le camere) né può impedirlo ai giudici. Idem per l'esecutivo. Invece un giudice può privare un membro del legislativo o dell'esecutivo della sua libertà _impedendogli di fatto di esercitare le funzioni per cui è stato eletto o nominato_, e per questo c'è la possibilità dell'immunità parlamentare.

null,false,marsman,NORN,Northern Ireland,null,"&gt; If you can prove he knew (or ""should have known"") that he was undermining the economy, and he still did it because all he cared for was his personal benefit (e.g. ""get more votes""), I think there's a high chance this is a crime.

Like I said, that is an utterly insane position. If I am a member of say, the Green party and want to bring in legislation that helps the environment, but harms businesses, and it's popular, that's hardly a crime. It's a different priority. Surely there is no way you could force politicians to take a position that they have to put the economy above all other considerations..

&gt;Maybe not treason since at least in RO treason also explicitly requires that you act in coordination with a foreign agent. (and implicitly requires that said foreign agent has interests that are contrary to national interests)

That at least seems fairly reasonable in terms of defining treason, and I'd agree with you that it doesn't sem to apply.

&gt;Contrary to popular belief, the reason why we have elected politicians in a democracy is not because ""we want somebody popular in power"" but because we need to have someone govern us.

No, the reason why we have elected politicians in a democracy is because we need people to represent us in government. They are there to act on our behalf, so they make the case in elections and we decide who it is that would best represent us.  It isn't because we need someone to govern us (kings and queens can govern, so can dictators.. representative democracy is about having a voice in governance). 

&gt; It is implied that the governments should act in the interest of the people, and indeed many laws try to formalise this requirement.

It is almost impossible to define 'in the interests of the people' to the point that essentially it is meaningless, or constrains your democracy. You can argue that almost anything is in the interests of the people, or that the same thing opposes it. In the context of Greece you could argue that a Grexit would be a benefit and that not carrying one out is detrimental to the Greek peoples interests. You could argue that joining the Euro was detrimental, or that the recent legislation passed is detrimental, you could argue that all defence spending is not in the interests of the Greek people, or that any particular budget is or isn't..

&gt;A valid reason to seek an elected position is ""to be able to push policies that you believe would be for the benefit of the population"".

Absolutely. As is 'to be able to push policies that you believe are necessary, moral or right, that they will benefit people in the long term, that they will deal with a threat or whatever. It's also legitimate to push for a particular ideology even if it isn't popular.

&gt;Seeking an elected position just ""to get popularity, and thus money and power"" is not something that is or should be encouraged by law.

But acting in a manner that is popular when you hold an elected position is essentially the job isn't it? Representing the views of Greek people in the context of your values and beliefs. Power is a by-product of that (you have to be able to 'do' something when elected.. every politician wants the power to implement their ideas after all.  As for money, that seems like a smear tacked on to make everything sound a bit seedy. It doesn't seem like there was a greed element to any of this, no-one seems to be suggesting that there was an attempt to defraud, steal, embezzle or anything else.. 

&gt;Yes, politicians do that - but they don't do it because ""it's normal"", they do it because they can (i.e. it's very hard to prove bad intention, they can simply claim ""millions of people believed this to be the right thing, of course I believed it, too! There's no reasonable way I could have known it is a bad thing - look at all these people, are you saying they are all unreasonable?"")

It's very hard to prove bad intentions when someone doing exactly what you'd expect them to do, exactly what they said they'd do and exactly what they were elected to do, especially when it is popular? To be hones't I'm not sure why you'd want to do anything about that... This sees to boil down to politicians possibly not having the right motivations, and that this should somehow be illegal...

All of this seems like a recipe for the kind of 'I don't like what you are doing, so I think it's illegal' type thinking that gets so popular in more litigious societies. And all in it seems pretty absurd.

Detto questo però, non posso dimenticare tutte le volte che qualche poveraccio viene lasciato in libertà dopo aver commesso un reato e come da destra a sinistra su tutti i giornali monti la protesta per l'operato dei giudici (con tanto di interrogazioni parlamentari ed interventi del csm). Dalle parole di Gherardo Colombo:

&gt;Vi è un organizzazione complessiva della società e dello Stato, che va dal giornalista che fa il titolo urlato e scandalistico fino al Presidente del Consiglio che chiede pene severe ed esemplari dopo degli arresti preventivi, senza cioè che vi sia ancora alcun colpevole, che porta ad aberrazioni come queste. È il sistema nel suo complesso, la Costituzione materiale del Paese a porsi fuori dai dettami costituzionali. Ed è l'opinione pubblica, solitamente, a invocare provvedimenti eccezionali e immediati invece che normali.

Detto questo non credo che la soluzione sia il parlamento che si sostituisce al GIP, dato che questo entrerebbe prima di tutto in conflitto con la separazione dei poteri fondamentale in un paese democratico, e secondo perché genererebbe un privilegio per il parlamentare rispetto ad un normale cittadino. Visto che l'ho citata in un altro post, continuo dall'intervista a Casson:
&gt;In che senso?

&gt;Nel caso specifico bisognava valutare solo se vi fosse o meno il fumus persecutionis, invece si è andati oltre.

&gt;Cioè?

&gt;Si è voluto tutelare un componente della Casta.

P.S. Se qualcuno pensa che l'immunità parlamentare generi già di per se una casta si sbaglia, l'immunità serve non a proteggere il parlamentare, ma il parlamento da un possibile tentativo del potere giudiziario di inficiare quello legislativo, per questo è il fumus persecutionis ciò che deve essere cercato",null,0,null,1438247562,null,0,false,0,ctlcrw7,null,t3_3f4ngh,null,t1_ctlcrw7,null,t1_ctlc0gt,null,null,null,1440175220,null,6,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,6,null

That GDP alone is far from perfect is obvious. By itself it doesn't say anything about distribution of wealth, not to mention desirable developments not directly linked to the economy. But *totally worthless?*  
It's a decent enough indicator if you want to have one comparatively easy to measure value that tells you whether the economy is improving or worsening. That something isn't perfect doesn't make it ""totally worthless"", especially not if there aren't any good alternatives that, by themselves, can serve as a good measure for *the specific thing* this one is supposed to indicate.

Of course, a catalog of various indicators, of which GDP growth would be one, together with a qualitative analysis, combined into a multi-page report, would give you a more complete picture. But as far as one dimensional measurements go, GDP growth is pretty decent an indicator *for what it is supposed to measure.*

This will actually push wages down: each incremental hire produces less profit than the last.

This doesn't make sense.

First, I'm saying that there will be wage pressure upwards relative to the initial state.

Starting state: I have 100 workers.  They can produce 1 widget per worker per day.  They cost me $1/day, and this is my only cost.  The market price for my goods dictates that I could profitably produce 100 units/day.

A technological improvement happens that increases productivity.  I have 100 workers.  They can produce 2 widgets per day.  This halves my labor costs.  If I could sell at cost, I could sell..let's use an even larger multiplier, to make the situation more obvious, say 100M units/day.

However, I don't have the 50M workers required to produce those 100M units/day.  So I offer more money.  I offer $1.01/day.  At this price, I can find 30M workers willing to work for me.  Now I have 30M workers, and I can sell ~~30M~~ EDIT: sorry, thinko, 60M units.

Now a worker in the field is making more than he did in the original scenario, and his productivity is higher.  True, I'm not making as much per worker as I did with the 100 workers, but I have more workers.

Numerous NATO allies (especially the United States) has **huge** stockpiles of equipment; ranging from brand-new to decades old. Within that stockpile exists *plenty* of gear to fully kit-out the military of all three Baltic states several times over.

Per quanto riguarda la popolazione generale, il sistema non è e non può essere perfetto: ciò che si deve cercare è un bilanciamento dei diritti. Da un lato ci sono i diritti dell'accusato, ma dall'altro quelli dell'intera società che deve difendersi dal crimine. Io sono sinceramente dispiaciuto per quei poveri innocenti che, davvero senza motivo, sono magari finiti in carcere per accuse folli: li ci vuole responsabilità severa per i pm, se si sono accaniti ingiustamente, e per i gip se li hanno lasciati fare. Sono già meno solidale per chi si ritrova nei guai quando, sia pure innocente, si è immischiato in faccende sporche. L'esempio classico per me è il tipo che frequenta come amico un ladro sapendo che lo è, solo per finire accusato di una rapina (che non ha commesso) a sua volta. Li i suoi diritti vanno bilanciati con la ragionevole possibilità che sia colpevole, e le reazioni della società. Penso, senza fondamento lo ammetto, che di quel 10% di innocenti che erano in carcere (sarebbe utile una fonte, cmq) quel tipo sia la maggioranza.

T'as besoin de   
- Saté en poudre (l'extra saté de la marque You Huy est le meilleur, t'en trouves dans les épiceries asiat)  
- Lait de coco (si tu n'aimes pas tu peux prendre de la crème)  
- De la viande de ton choix (Poulet, steak haché, dinde, canard, à peu près tout fonctionne)  
- Du riz (riz thai si tu as/aime sinon basmati)  
- Oignons (Et tu peux même rajouter des piments doux des tomates séchées, etc)  
- Tes arachides  
  
- Tu commences par faire cuire ton riz,  
- Tu fais revenir tes oignons/piments/etc émincés dans une poêle avec un peu de matière grasse (libre a toi de concasser et faire griller tes arachides dans ce mélange),  
- Tu coupes ta viande en morceaux, tu l'assaisonnes selon tes envies (sel, poivre, jus de citron, ...) et tu la fais cuire (dans ta poêlée de condiments/légumes si tu veux, attention au timing pour ne rien faire cramer),  
- Dans une casserole tu fais chauffer ton lait de coco que tu mélanges avec une ou deux cuillères à soupe de poudre de saté (j'en met trois pour deux personnes, à toi de doser selon tes envies), tu peux laisser chauffer de 5 à 10 minutes pour que ta sauce réduise, si elle réduit trop tu peux diluer avec de la crème, il est très important de mélanger souvent pour diluer la poudre avec le lait de coco, et pour pas que le fond brule.  
- Au final tu mélanges ta viande, ta poêlée de condiments avec ta sauce, et voila !  
  
Personnellement je rajoute un peu de tabasco pour le fun.

My personal opinion is that yes this agency needs to be independent, but it is not functioning as one. It is actually controlled by the troika and can provide biased data to support actions by the troika. Therefore, the government has the right to change the head of the agency to a person that makes sure the agency functions independently.

When you enter Germany you will receive the typical EU tourist visa.  This gives you 90 days to figure everything out. From my experience, you really have two options in order to prove that you have ""sufficient funds."" 

The first option, and most popular, is the opening of a ""Sperrkonto.""  This is essentially a blocked bank account where you deposit all the money the government says you need (Something like 600 euro a month). You can start the process of opening a Sperrkonto before entering Germany.  Check out [this](https://www.deutsche-bank.de/pfb/content/privatkunden/konto_international-students-en.html) page. 

Second option is that you can have your parents write a letter saying that they are financially responsible for your well-being.  The German government will ask to see many of your parents' personal financial documents, and therefore, my family and I chose not to do this.  

Really, in order to receive my temporary residence permit, I did not do either of these.  I started the process very late, and my tourist visa was about to expire.  So, I was able to go to the foreigner's office with bank statements from USA bank accounts of both my parents and myself.  These statements were accepted as sufficient proof of my financial well-being.  It also helps to have already booked a flight home.  

Of course, the process is more technical than what I described.  However, while traveling back and forth to the Foreigner's Office was annoying, the workers were surprisingly easy-going, considering I speak very little German.  Let me know if you need any help.  I would recommend getting started on all of this ASAP.

It's true that nothing is ever free, but also remember that a service needs certain things to be viable, and funding is only one of these. Further the monies can be collected at several points -- and that there are more than two or three points in the service where the money can be collected.

In the case of Windows, there are at least these things the service needs to be viable:

I. **User base.** Microsoft is relying on the fact that it has a massive amount of users. This is important because it means they can push their services knowing they are going to succeed on markets and likely to become market leaders. With Windows, you don't have to worry about games not working or drivers not existing. 

The user base divides into  *corporate*, *home users* and *government* (including schools).  

II. **Trustworthiness**. One of Apple's biggest draws is that it (allegedly) doesn't get viruses. On the other hand, world is full of pirated Windows-machines that don't get updates for obvious reasons. Also for obvious reasons, they're full of viruses. 

Now for the money. The user base is huge, but the amount of money Microsoft gets from home users is relatively little: the bundled OS's only bring few dollars in (if that) and many have pirated OS's (particularly in China). And not that many buy OS upgrades anyway, so giving the update for free might actually lose only very little amount of money. (After all, the home users are still paying for NEW licences.)
 
On the other hand, corporate and government pay a lot of the licences, and they do their buying decisions based on what the decision makers use at home. They are also concerned over security, so getting home users to update their machines regularly means more sales for corporate and government. 

So yes, Microsoft will lose some money over the free updates. But actually, relatively little. What they get is a more trustworthy and robust ecosystem that is easier to sell in future. It's a cost for Microsoft, but so is developing a new OS. Saying that ""if you don't pay, you aren't the customer"" is extremely stupid, because you can be paying for your product in other ways than just with your wallet or with your privacy. 


(EDIT: Another example: according to studies, the most important decision maker for purchases in a family is the child. This is even though the child seldom has any money of their own. But the parents tend to follow child's urges, so being able to influence/market to the child also swings the wallets of the parents. This is why fast food restaurants have child parks and morning cereals have toys. In the Windows 10-case, the home users are very much the children-decision makers: not valuable in themselves, but valuable because they affect those who have money.)",null,0,null,1438251572,null,0,1438252522,0,ctldq2a,null,t3_3f0yo2,null,t1_ctldq2a,null,t1_ctkkrvw,null,null,null,1440175667,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

* Platforma Obywatelska / Civic Platform - mainstream European centre-right, basically a CDU clone. In power for eight years, now losing support due to corruption. EPP member.
* Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe / Polish People's Party - agrarian centre-right. Economically more left-wing than PO, socially more conservative. EPP member.
* Prawo i Sprawiedliwość / Law and Justice - national conservatives, Eurosceptics, conspiracy theorists, in full alliance with the Catholic Church. Declaratively etatist, but when in power they act neoliberal. ECR member for some reason, though they're much farther to the right than UK's Tories.
* Polska Razem Zjednoczona Prawica / Poland Together United Right - PiS pawn, no real difference. National conservatives. Merged from Polska Razem (PO splinter faction) and Solidarna Polska (PiS splinter faction), the latter being formerly an EFD member.
* Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej / Democratic Left Alliance - former communists turned nominal socialdemocrats, but actually blairites. Pro-EU. Once powerful, then corruption made them a single-digit-percent party. They talk left-wing in opposition, but act neoliberal when in power. They allowed CIA secret prisons in Poland. PES / S&amp;D member.
* Twój Ruch / Your Movement - social-liberal anti-clerical party, now almost completely defunct (down from 40 MPs to 13 during current parliament term). Pro-EU.
* Zieloni / The Greens - run of the mill pro-EU Green party. Originally centrist, recently moving to the left. European Greens member. 
* Unia Pracy / Labor United - in the beginning they tried to build a non-postcommunist social democratic party, but now are to SLD what PRZP is to PiS. PES / S&amp;D member.
* Partia Demokratyczna / Democratic Party - whatever's left from the once powerful Liberty Union, social liberals, pro-EU, completely irrelevant now. ALDE member.
* KORWiN - socially ultraconservative, market fundamentalists, anti-EU. Janusz Korwin-Mikke's one-man show. Ron Paul is a sane moderate compared to JKM. MEPs are EFDD members.
* Kukiz '15 - like Beppe Grillo but worse. One-man show by a former rock singer Paweł Kukiz. He moved from centre-right positions to a mix of radical nationalism and totally WTF ideas.
* Razem / Together - a newly formed left wing party, social democratic, PODEMOS-style.

Disclaimer: the experience varies hugely based on what type of function you have and what type of leaders you have.

**The negatives:**

1) 70% of the time is just a waste of your life. You run to wait and you wait to run.

2) The place is allergic to innovation. A popular proverb in the army is (not sure if it translates well): 

&gt; it is that way because it is and it stays that way because it was.

I know this is not  limited to the Swiss army but this mentality pisses me off so much.

3) People who achieved nothing in their private life can live out their power tripping fantasies and fuck you from morning till night. That changes with time though. Once you're out of the ""training"" phase (usually about 5 months) and enter the annual 3-week-repetition-course cycle, the power dynamic changes  a lot. A 32 year old family father is not going to take shit from a 20 year old lieutenant fresh out of boot camp.

4) Most people who attend tertiary eduction graduate about a year later

5) You'll miss women.

**The positives:**

1) You get to meet people outside of your socio-economic circle. I also learned a bit of Italian, which is cool.

2) You (can) make some really good friends. 

**Overall**:

It fucking sucks.

I have some remarks on your thoughts though.

First off, what you say about French treatment of immigrants is not untrue, but all other countries in Europe besides maybe Greece and Italy should probably give France a break. When you look into the issues on immigration and integration, France is the only country in the EU that I would probably label as 'troublesome' in this regard. The sheer number of non-native French (or non-native French roots, of course) is enormous and makes all other EU countries pale (perhaps quite literally) in comparison. Integration of these peoples has had a mixed success and has been less and less effective. This gives rise to complex tensions between native (rooted) French, fresh immigrants, peoples of other cultures/races born in france and of course the frustrated dynamics this causes for well-integrated and well-meaning people of non-french roots/origin. *In short: whatever problems we (Belgium/UK) have with immigration/integration, France has it triple.*

Another remark is more an addition on why immigrants/refugees are now coming so much to the UK, the UK has a huge diversity of minorities, and many of these minorities come from countries from where the biggest influx in EU is today. They often prefer to go where there's already communities of their origin, and the UK has plenty.

Lastly, before this post gets too big (too late probably), let's not forget to distinct immigrants with refugees. Some people seem to think the influx we have today is ALL refugees (from Syria/Eritrea etc), the truth is that the chaos in the middle east have also enticed people from non-violent (but poor) parts of Africa to try and cross over because it has become easier and human traffickers have popped up everywhere. So the majority of people on these boats are immigrants, not refugees.

not especially these jokes, but jokes generally are popular in hungaristan. see you can easily replace the hero of the joke with someone else (fe. policemen, mother in law, blonde woman, jew, gipsy, firemen etc.). most popular jokes imo are the naughty jokes, or the old-wise-country-man vs. educated-townsman jokes or szekler jokes.

i think these ""protect the few what you already have"" jokes are popular because hungarians can relate to the situation. you laugh devilish: ehe-he, i can spare a few copper by making someone else suffer a bit, or ah-haha, i would do just the same mistake trying to make my life easier.

see a hungarian can easily relate to the boy and his father in this joke, because they know, that in hungary if you get a cheap present as a child from your hard working parents, you can be sure your parents will hold it against you in the next 15 years.

Obviously things will get lost in translation, but I really don't think there is sexism here, rudeness - 100%. Sexism not quite sure about. 

This bs about what he was thinking is not fair to him. Saying someone implied something or that it was his subconscious talking is a way of twisting someone's words. He said what he said and that's all we have to go by to judge it.  If he said Lady, shut up where Lady is being used to address her in the same way you would call someone sir I call not sexist. 

Plus it seams like she interrupted his speech, if a man interrupted his speech and he told a man to shut up would anyone care? Or are we gonna act like it's different because women face so much adversities and the poor women need help?

Again I am going by what the article is saying, I wasn't there, things could have gone totally different and he could be a raging misogynist but from what I am reading from the article it seams like a ""lady"" was being rude and interrupted his speech so he acted in a rude manner himself.

No, I don't. I have trouble understanding utter stupidity and dogmatism.

&gt; This isn't about 'autoritarian' or whatever.

Yes, it is. It is about telling other people how they should speak. You know who used to do that in Spain?

&gt; St Pauls cathedral isn't 'Santo Pablo' just beacause you happen to speak spanish.

It's [San Pablo](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catedral_de_San_Pablo_de_Londres) actually, when I'm using Spanish. Just like you are free to call it ""[Catedral de Sant Pau](http://www.worldtravelguides.org/londres/catedral-de-sant-pau.php)"" in Catalan. 

&gt; The language of Catalonia is catalan, it's a pretty logical thing to understand, I mean, every country works the same way.

You've never lived in Belgium, I guess. Anyway, Catalan is *one* language of Catalonia. [Aranese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aranese_dialect) is another one and, guess what? So is Spanish. Dismissing the mother tongue of nearly half the population of Catalonia, a language used by such *Catalan* authors as [Eduardo Mendoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Mendoza_Garriga), [Pere Gimferrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pere_Gimferrer), [Manuel Vazquez Montalban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_V%C3%A1zquez_Montalb%C3%A1n), is an act of cultural self-mutilation.

&gt; Now, both you and me know that in the second republic the estatut de nuria was only active for a few years so don't falsify history yourself.

What have I falsified? It isn't me who claimed that it was Franco, or Primo de Rivera, who ""popularized"" the name ""Ensanche"". Stop your persecution complex.

&gt; How hard is it to grasp that there's a name for a thing?

And how hard is it to grasp that can be as many names (or more) for the same thing as there are different languages?

C'est la notion de nouveaux métiers qui à permis la création de la CIPAV par exemple , en se référant à la loi de 1948, tu peux donc créer une confédération ou une fédération de cotisants pour créer ta caisse.
Ceci dit se pose ensuite le problème du refinancement via le triparty ou la loi d'ailly auprès de la banque de france, le problème d'immatriculation comme fond de gestion et d'acteur de marché pour diminuer les frais et ensuite des assurances sur les risques de marché qui coûte un bras.

En gros, en rendement actuaire, tu ne peux pas vraiment espérer gagner plus de 2% sur 30 ans. D'ailleurs si tu analyses tous les fonds de retraites, tu noteras qu'il n'ont jamais fait mieux que le CAC40. Donc il n'est pas possible structurellement de créer un fond de pension par répartition qui payent des passifs indépendamment de leur actif passés. 

Deux effets sont trompeurs : 
La démographie des cotisants ( Nombre Actifs vs Longévité du Passifs )
L'investissement en rendement.

Le premier est évident , en cas déséquilibre, c'est la faillite
Le deuxième est subtil mais remonte à 1900. Les marchés de capitaux sont un jeu à somme nulle, sur 40 ans, vous ne ferez jamais mieux que le taux sans risques, voir cours de finance 'martingale'. 

La situation de l'argic et de l'arcoc sont due à plusieurs facteurs due à la politique des 30 dernières années ( l'arrivée au pouvoir de Mitterrand, de Chirac et de Sarkozy ) et de la mafia des syndicats, due à l'éffondrements des rendements de taux , due à la création de la CSG/RDS sur les revenues de coupons et due à la taxe tobin et l'annonce de la BCE de son programme de rachat.

Sans compter que la caisse des dépots à fait des pertes de plus de 2 milliards , et toutes les villes françaises gérer par des énarques en contribuer pour 300 milliards de dettes non structurés ( rien que Martine Aubry c'est 2.5 milliard de perdu pour la ville de Lille à cause des swaps qu'elle a signé , Le Top 10 des énarques maires c'est une perte de 30 milliards )
Ces pertes ont un coup directe sur le montant des retraites, car l'état qui émettait des bonds OAT 10 et OAT20 est obligé d'émettre des bonds avec des taux le plus bas possible pour diminuer le coup de la dette. Tuant ainsi tous les espoirs des gérants de fond de retraite d'avoir un revenu sécurisé.

L'ircantec était prévu d'être en faillite pour 2012, en 2008 lors de privatisation de la Poste, un bon nombre de syndicats et d'élus se sont inquiétés de leur retraite et ont donc proposer de prélever en toute illégalité une soulte à l'argic et l'arrco. Malgré certaines tentatives de faire scandale, les médias ont passé sous silence cette escroquerie.

30 milliards sur 10 ans , c'est un manque à gagner de (102%)^10, soit donc 21% = 6 milliards.

D'autant que :
Certains retraités de la fonction publique logent dans des logements de l'état : C'est donc un gain du montant du loyer sur le niveau de retraite.
Certains retraités cumulent des retraites d'élus plusieurs fois , l'ircantec paye autant de fois l'élus qu'il a eu de mandat. Vous comprendrez que ce n'est pas un hasard si Sarkozy a essayer de mettre son fils président du conseil général ( une retraite d'élu cumulable avec ses activités professionnels 1225eur/mois ) c'est pas mal. 

Avec les largesses hallucinantes de l'ircantec, les défauts de gestion, les 30 milliards ne suffisent toujours pas à sauver cette caisse. Qui pèse désormais pour 15% dans la dette de l'état français.

Cette dette de 15% génère une dette structurelle de 2%.
Donc chaque 100 euro de l'ircantec coutes toutes les 10 ans à la France 21 euro en plus de dette.

Der übliche Ignorant (Links/Rechts/Whatever) postet eine Statistik und denkt in seiner Ignoranz, dass dies seine Meinung validiert. Dem ist aber nicht so.

**Q: My ancestors were German nationals / One parent was born in Germany. Can I get a German passport?**

**A:** German passports are only issued to German citizens. Having German ancestors resp. the fact that your father and/or your mother was/were born in Germany is unfortunately not enough to attain German citizenship. Rather, your father and/or mother have to have been German citizens at the time of your birth. If you were born before 1 January 1975 and your parents were married, you only attained German citizenship if your father was German at the time of your birth or if your parents submitted a declaration by 31 December 1977 stating they wanted German citizenship for their child.

Under the Dublin Regulation, asylum requests need to be processed by the country in which the seeker first applied for asylum. It's not strictly speaking a question of motivation, although some countries do either straight-up refuse to process asylum requests or reject the vast majority of them, while others approve more of them (but that's still a very small number - there were 625,920 asylum applicants EU-wide in 2014 and only 23,295 (3,7%) applications were decided upon and approved, some of which were likely from previous years). The slow pace at which asylum applications are processed is a huge problem.

According to 2014 Eurostat data on [the number of asylum requests](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/12/Number_of_%28non-EU%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_EU_and_EFTA_Member_States%2C_by_age_distribution%2C_2014_%28%C2%B9%29_YB15_III.png) and actual [decisions](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/dd/Final_decisions_on_%28non-EU%29_asylum_applications%2C_2014_%28number%2C_rounded_figures%29_YB15_IV.png) as well as [Guardian data on refugees per capita](http://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/may/11/which-eu-countries-receive-the-most-asylum-seekers), Germany received by far the most (32%) asylum requests - 202,465 in 2014. 6995 out of 44,335 decisions (16%) were positive. It's 6th (out of 28 EU member states) in terms of the number of asylum seekers relative to population.

Sweden received the second-highest number of applications in 2014, which is 13% of all applications. 19% of final decisions (2375 out of 13,130) were positive. It's #1 in terms of the number of asylum seekers relative to population.

Italy received the third-highest number of applications in 2014 (64,625), which is 10% of all applications. 82% of final decisions were positive, but it only made 55 decisions altogether. It's #12 in terms of the number of asylum seekers relative to population.

France received the fourth-highest number of applications in 2014 (64,310, roughly the same as Italy), which is 10% of all applications. 16% of final decisions (5828 out of 37,085) were positive. It's #13 in terms of the number of asylum seekers relative to population.

Hungary received the fifth-highest number of applications in 2014 (42,775), which is 7% of all applications. 16% of final decisions (40 out of 840) were positive. It's #2 in terms of the number of asylum seekers relative to population.

The top five countries (in terms of asylum applications) received 73% (455,535 out of 625,920) of asylum applications, but only made 66% (15,280 out of 23,295) of all positive decisions.

Technically Italy has the highest proportion of positive decisions relative to all decisions, but like I said, it only processes very few of them. Five EU countries (Slovenia, Croatia, Slovakia, Portugal and Latvia) made no positive decisions in 2014.",null,0,null,1438255814,null,0,1438256903,0,ctleutu,null,t3_3f57ot,null,t1_ctleutu,null,t3_3f57ot,null,null,null,1440176201,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

**T**wo kids from Naples dream of becoming Milanese, and they discover in an old grimoire that the only way is to swim across the Po. They reveal this to their dad, who is skeptical, but decides to humor them, thinking it a mere childish fantasy. So they drive up north, find a spot where the Po is shallow and settle there. The father wants to go first, since it may be dangerous. He dives in the water and easily swim across. He gestures them to go ahead, and the older brother decides to go first. He dives and swim for a bit, but gets tired and stops in the middle of river.

The father just looks at him.

""Dad, dad, I'm tired, can you help me?""

The father, visibly annoyed, yells back.

After a couple of hours, the French tries his luck, and reaches outside the basket. He laughs and declares with pride ""We're in Paris!"". They ask how could he know, and he answered that he felt the Eiffel Tower with his hand, and that every Frenchman could recognize the Eiffel Tower just by touching it, and, lo and behold they are actually in Paris. After a couple of hours, the Neapolitan gives it a try, and reaches outside the basket. He sighs and says dejectedly ""We're in Naples.""

Austria has either military service or civil service for young Austrian men only (18-35), conscription is up to 60 years or so, only for men as well.

Military service was reduced to 6 months (from 8 months) in 2006, civil service is only available to you if you declare you are personally against doing military service (e.g. you don't like weapons). It lasts 9 months (12 months before 2006) and is often in hospitals, the red cross, homes for old or disabled people or WWII memorial sites or documentation institutions.

About experiences: I kinda liked it (military service) and got lucky with my superiors who were strict but fair and mostly focussed on working together with us recruits. If you have specific questions, feel free to ask.

My personal opinion about military service: I think it is a good thing in the end (though I would extend it to both genders). After being part of the military for a while it definitely gives you a different point of view compared to only popular cultire (movies, games). A bad analogy would be to experience a relationship yourself vs. only watching porn, romcoms and reading books about relationships.  
I do NOT want to be in a country where the military only consists of people that really want to be in the military or need the money. In my opinion a proper military should be comprised of a cross-section of the general population. Also I think that the risk of my country starting a war or getting engaged in a foreign conflict is much lower if everybody knows someone who currently is or was in the military and who would be affected by this, not only poor kids looking for money by doing risky jobs or gun nuts.",null,0,null,1438256373,null,0,1438257160,0,ctlf0vp,null,t3_3f3pfv,null,t1_ctlf0vp,null,t3_3f3pfv,null,null,null,1440176280,null,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6,null

&gt; La Giunta per le elezioni e le immunità ha deciso a suo tempo di attendere, sinceramente non so quanto opportunamente, la decisione del Tribunale del riesame. Azzollini aveva offerto elementi che avrebbero potuto far pensare alla presenza di fumus persecutionis. Gli elementi da lui portati, però, erano rivolti tutti all’azione della procura di Trani, che si sarebbe mossa – a suo dire – nutrendo pregiudizi nei suoi confronti. Qui, invece, siamo di fronte a un’ordinanza del giudice per le indagini preliminari, un magistrato terzo rispetto alla procura. Per questo, l’ipotesi avanzata da Azzollini non regge.

Ovviamente tutto ciò può essere un complotto di un gruppo di magistrati ai danni di Azzollini, ma credo che a quel punto non basterebbe il divieto all'arresto. E questo è il problema ultimo che trovo, se chi ha negato l'arresto è così convinto del fumus persecutionis e che ci sia un complotto ai suoi danni, perché nessuno si muove per un conflitto di attribuzioni, o peggio ancora, una denuncia per attentato a organo dello stato? di certo non si potranno lasciare giudici complottisti liberi di indagare e giudicare...",null,0,null,1438256467,null,0,1438257250,0,ctlf1wi,null,t3_3f4ngh,null,t1_ctlf1wi,null,t1_ctldn38,null,null,null,1440176293,null,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1,null

**Wi-Fi Passwörter werden standartmäßig mit jedem Freund auf Facebook, Skype und mit jedem Kontakt in der Kontaktliste geteilt. (So genanntes ""Wi-Fi Sense"") (In Deutschland ganz toll, gerade bei der Abmahnindustrie und Drosselungen sehr zu empfehlen)**

Lösung: Einstellungen -&gt; Netzwerk und Internet -&gt; Wi-Fi -&gt; Wi-Fi Einstellungen Ändern -&gt; Alle Optionen deaktivieren


**XBox Apps, Candy Crush und andere Rotze wird standartmäßig mitgeliefert.**

Lösung: CCleaner Installieren und die ganze Scheiße entfernen. Frage mich sowieso was eine XBox App auf einem Betriebssystem zu suchen hat. Microsaft buddelt wohl auch schon nach Gold in der Erde.

How true is this? I always had the impression that /u/SlyRatchet tries to be careful with what he says. And although he is sometimes wrong, he generally tries to be mindful of there being more than one side to any issue.  

I haven't seen him running around accusing others of being racist as much as many other people do... have you?  
What I have seen is other people getting away with (i.e. not facing moderation) actively trolling and destroying the climate of discussion by calling others racist or circlejerking in other ways, including in this thread, and that's part of what needs to be moderated as much as racism is.  
The solution to deteriorating quality of conversation is not moving all threads into one sticky and reducing traffic, it's moderating, encouraging **both sides** to act like civilized human beings instead of this monkey circus we keep seeing.

Das ganze Gesetz ist doch eben aus der Mißverständlichkeit der nicht-verbalen Kommunikation entstanden. Vermeindliche oder tatsächliche Vergewaltiger, die nach der Tat beteuern sie hätten die Körpersprache des Opfers als Zustimmung verstanden. Wie soll jetzt auf einmal mit einem gesetzlichen Invalidierung dieser Interpretation irgendetwas anderes als explizite, verbale oder schriftliche Willensbekundung ausreichend sein?

Scott Lemieux ist auch ""nur"" eine Meinung, und letztendlich muss man auf Präzendenzfälle warten. Fakt ist aber, dass das Gesetz Unsicherheiten bringt, anstatt sie zu beseitigten. Um auf der sicheren Seite sein zu wollen, muss man eine unmissverständliche Aussage verbal oder schriftlich äußern. Alles andere ist Interpretationsfrage, und die geht wenn man die Entstehungsgeschichte des Gesetz anschaut wohl eher zu Lasten des Angeklagten.

Es gibt genügend andere Bereiche des normalen Lebens wo konkludentes Handeln auch nicht ausreichend ist, sondern ein explizite Willensbekundigung notwendig ist.

Du wärst überrascht. Ich habe auch mal drei Wochen von 19-Cent-Spaghetti gelebt, ohne Sauce, einfach, nur um den Magen voll zu bekommen. Ich kenne Hunger. Ich kenne Armut.

Und selbst damals habe ich es geschafft, zu sparen. 

&gt; Du hast im Monat als Mensch ein Minimum an Ausgaben, welches du ausgeben musst, um überleben zu können. Da kommt dann eben Miete rein, ein Mindestwert für Ernährung(muss ja nichtmal gute sein, reicht ja wenn du auf deine kcal am Tag kommst die du brauchst), Nebenkosten, ab und zu wirst du mal ein paar Schuhe brauchen, weil dein Altes kaputt gegangen ist, etc. 

Glaub mir, das ist alles schon jammern auf hohem Niveau. Zum Beispiel kann man auch eine Zeitlang gut auf Kaloriendefizit leben, Schuhe kann man reparieren (oder sich anderweitig besorgen), Miete und Nebenkosten kann man sich über Roommates reinholen, und wenn man *wirklich* arm ist, dann muss man eben auch mal in den sauren Apfel beißen und reduzieren.

&gt;  Die Hälfte des Geldes geht bereits für Miete drauf. Setz dich mal hin und kalkulier dir ein Leben auf 225€ im Monat und schau wie viel du am Ende des Monats sparen kannst.

Alright, let's dance.

Funny you should mention that. Within the collective reserves of NATO exists enough equipment to equip a 'Baltic' mechanized division and air-force. It's not a matter of the equipment; it's a matter of the costs associated with operation, maintenance, and training. But I'd love to see unified Baltic aerial and mechanized divisions; alone they'd be unable to field the systems, but together I imagine they'd have the funding necessary.

&gt;I was actually thinking about AAVs like the M6 Bradley, but it seems we're currently only looking for manpads.

And again, there are thousands in reserves collecting dust. They've procured far more systems than they'd ever need.

I'd follow Hanlon's razor here and start with an assumption of helplessness rather than malice.  
It seems plausible that mods want there to be a better climate for discussion, but either don't have the man hours to moderate heavily enough to pull it off (i.e. addressing all the trolling and circlejerking, all the generalizations **from both sides**),  
or don't think that if they were to attempt such a thing, the backlash would be even more pronounced, as you would end up with very heavy policing of the comment sections, and people are already calling mods Nazis for ""just deleting racism"".

I mean, look at how much toxic, nonconstructive shit gets posted in this thread alone, how many people here are circlejerking about how everyone who doesn't like this megathread must be racist, etc. If this was my forum and I was a moderator here, none of that would fly, because none of it is conducive to proper discussion, and all of it is obviously malignant, even if what leads people to take these actions are good intentions.

So they're between a rock and a hard place. Creating a megathread is a easier thing to do from a number of considerations. But it isn't anywhere close to a solution by any means. As many others have put it, it's indeed nothing other than sweeping it under the rug. The main problems remain unaddressed.

* A Czech's diary: DAY ONE- I'm drinking with the eastern Slovaks. DAY TWO- I almost died. DAY THREE- I should have died yesterday. (We drink a lot in the east here)

---


Now there are a LOT of jokes about the slight difference in words (false friend words that sound similar/same, but have different meaning)

* A Czech runs to a public bathroom in Bratislava, but the door is locked. He knicks vigorously and yells ""Eats there anyone there?!"" .. ""EATS THERE ANYONE?!""... ..... .... from the stall: ""Who the fuck would eat in here?""

* A Slovak walks into a czech bar and asks for a Whiskey. Bartender: ""Skotskou?"" (CZ:scottish? / SK:With a cube?) Slovak: ""Bez kocky"" (without a cube)

* There's a war between Czechs and Slovaks and a Czech says he can't handle it anymore and asks his friend how to say ""peace"" in slovak. He says ""mier"". So he jumps out of the trench and yells ""Mier Mier!"" (which also unfortunately means ""aim"" in Slovak), so the Slovak soldier mumbles to himself ""Alright, I'm aiming I'm aiming, just stand still jeez.""

Ecco perchè ritengo la proposta dell'utente che ti ho esposto prima potrebbe essere un modo per evitare che /r/italy , come è ora, sia una brutta copia di FB. Più pluralità di gestione con nuovi mod per ogni sub dove ci sia la scelta da parte di ognuno di gestire e impostare come meglio crede il proprio sub. Certo, ci vuole coraggio, ma quello si trova, se lo trovato io ad aprire /r/politicaITA.....

&gt;questo lo dici tu, sono tuoi giudizi, io ci andrei piano a farli passare come verità assodate, come fai poi

E perchè? Certo è la mia di ""Verità"", quella che ti devi creare e non attendere da niente e nessuno, parafrasando N. Makhno.

&gt;i  link che metto qui personalmente (come semplice utente) sono una selezione di ciò che io trovo interessante,

Concordo .

 &gt;poi il sub come è impostato non è una dittatura, ognuno linka, upvota e downvota ciò che vuole.

Qui un pò meno, /r/italy è una dittatura, un posto dove a suon di downvote si impone a forza una certa ""linea di pensiero"", si downvota a prescindere, ma di questo abbiamo già discusso mille volte quindi inutile ripetersi.

&gt;Ma non è che siccome non è tutto come politicaITA, allora è tutto merda senza qualità.

Se il tuo ragionamento fosse corretto e sincero  anche tu ogni  tanto saresti a commentare su /r/politicaITA, come io ogni tanto posto e linko ancora su /r/italy, non ho una visione manichea della vita, figuriamoci di /r/italy, non so se posso dire altrettanto di te.

Probably, it will be recommended to improve the assessment of where it is save to fly, and to have
better communication between airliners, and between governments and airliners. Currently,
countries decide whether it is safe to fly over their airspace. Maybe this should be done by an
independent organization. 

Even if there will be a tribunal, I consider it improbable that there
will be convictions. The most likely scenario is that separatists believed
they were shooting at a Ukrainian military plane. 

This is similar to Americans dropping a bomb on civilians in Iraq,
or Israeli bombing a school in Gaza. This happens all the time, and
nobody ever gets convicted for this. Because of this, I consider
it improbable that there will be convictions in a fair trial.

It still may help to find out the truth. How much was Russian government
involved in making the Buk available? Up to which level was government involved?
Was it done by Russians or by separatists?

Devo dire che in 4 anni le occasioni in cui c'è stato un blocco del denaro veramente inaspettato sarnno state 4 o 5 al massimo.

Bisogna fare un distinguo tra sostituzione e restituzione (oggetti rotti), e recesso: 

- Un oggetto sostituito è una rogna, ma non hai perso la vendita, e quindi tenti di risolvere il prima possibile in maniera che al cliente non venga in mente di chiedere il rimborso.

- Un cliente che chiede la restituzione di un oggetto danneggiato è una vendita persa, ma la legge è dalla sua parte e conviene sbrigare in fretta la pratica per togliersi il pensiero, indipendentemente da come ha pagato. 

- Una recesso è una vendita persa, quindi si fa di tutto per scoraggiare il cliente: innanzitutto si pretende, come vuole la legge, di avere la comunicazione di esercizio del diritto di recesso tramite raccomandata, entro 10 giorni dall'arrivo della merce; si fa inoltre presente al cliente che tutte le spese di rientro sono a suo carico e che, se l'oggetto non dovesse essere in condizioni di rivendibilità, ci riserviamo di non effettuare il rimborso e di rispedirgli l'oggetto, ovviamente addebitandogli una nuova spedizione.
Tutto quello scritto qui sopra è però un bluff: se il cliente ci rimanda l'oggetto, anche senza raccomandata, anche con la scatola rovinata o palesemente usato, dobbiamo fargli il rimborso: il rischio che si corre a non farlo è maggiore rispetto alla perdita (a meno che non si tratti di roba che costa parecchio, diciamo più di 1000€)",null,0,null,1438259196,null,0,false,0,ctlg08f,null,t3_3f51qq,null,t1_ctlg08f,null,t1_ctld0bx,null,null,null,1440176743,null,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5,null

Io non ne sento il bisogno, se tu credi possa essere una strada interessante per l'utenza da percorrere, apri un thread qui, se ne discute e si vede cosa si pensa. Ma di nuovo, quel ""brutta copia di FB"" è un tuo parere, non spacciarlo come cosa assodata.

&gt;  /r/italy è una dittatura, un posto dove a suon di downvote si impone a forza una certa ""linea di pensiero""

Di nuovo, sono tue idee queste. Cerco di spiegarti come la penso al riguardo: ci sarà sempre un'opinione prevalente, quando c'è un gruppo abbastanza grande. Non so se hai notato, ma quando qui si parla di questioni di genere, di garantismo, di facoltà umanistiche vs STEM, di Putin, io sono sempre, sempre, SEMPRE in minoranza, vengo enormemente downvotato e mi infilo in discussioni in cui mi trovo 5 persone che mi insultano e mi dicono che non capisco niente.

Questo vuol dire che è una dittatura? Questo mi ha portato a scappare e a dire ""ci sono gli alt che mi perseguitano""?. No, ho preso atto che ho delle opinioni di minoranza, le difendo e discuto, e poi si tira avanti. Il trucco, per me, è fottersene dei downvote, ve l'ho detto mille volte. Ad ossessionarcisi ci si sbatte solo il muso e si entra in un circolo vizioso (vieni downvotato per i motivi più disparati ---&gt; te ne lamenti e vedi cospirazioni ----&gt; vieni downvotato perché giudicato noioso e paranoico).

According to you.  Others (the actual majority of Europeans) says it is the economy. Other people say it is the next door nuclear armed power performing land-grabs that we should care about more.  Others say it is our energy production that is the most important and its global impact.  Even other people say corruption and or child sex scandals at the highest levels are the most important.   

A lot of people, like you, state as a fact that immigration is our biggest issue.  I think it's our biggest karma generator.

Recently, the government has tried to boost the number of reservists (Territorial Army) to counter-balance cuts in army personnel but this has failed badly and no were near enough people have signed up for the TA despite  the recruitment drive. I think this is because in the UK there is the attitude that military service is a full time job or career- not something you'd do casually as a ""weekend warrior"" so to speak. 

I can't think of any developed nations though that would send their conscripts to fight wars abroad- The TA are for home defence and I certainly would not expect countries such as Finland or Austria to send their conscripts to fight abroad- as I understand they're strictly for home defence or am I wrong there?  If you're a small country bordering a larger military power then conscription makes sense (although I'm not sure who is going to invade Austria in the 21st century!) but in the UK we're an island and ultimately if anyone did manage to invade us we'd be using nuclear weapons rather than our own conscripts.

Sounds to me like 'they' got the wrong information from your employer. Call it not an internship, but a temporary work. You want them to approve it according to the 'normal regulations' for a temporary position, because this is -in fact- what it is. Your potential employer might have to jump some other loopholes in that case.

Make sure that they called the immigration office (Ausländerbehörde). They will process and prove your visa and they will ask the ZAV (department of the employment office) for approval. The employment office (Bundesagentur für Abeit) does provide some of the required information for your employer on their homepage in German. I am sorry, but the ZAV does not know a lot about immigration in terms of visa requirements, since they 'only' approve if you can take that position.

You should do some reading.

Please check the Beschäftigungsverordnung, it contains the regulations concerning work permits and mainly contains regulations used by the employment office (ZAV)
§15: Contains the regulations about internships that you talked about.

The Immigration law that you should definitely read is called 'Aufenthaltsgesetz'. This is what the immigration office will work with. This should be your main guide concerning the visa regulations.

When I asked the local immigration office about a work permit and a permanent resident status for someone from North America, they told me that it will not be an issue to process when we can provide a work contract. So you should rename your 'internship' to what it actually is, a temporary work contract. All questions should be directed towards the immigration office, and not the ZAV. The immigration office has the final say in any case",null,0,null,1438260044,null,0,false,0,ctlgco6,null,t3_3f5cu1,null,t1_ctlgco6,null,t3_3f5cu1,null,null,null,1440176906,null,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2,null
