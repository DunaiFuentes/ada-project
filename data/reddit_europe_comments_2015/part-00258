With regards to Portugal though, they have implemented literally every single measure the Troika demanded but are still being compared to Greece constantly here on Reddit but in the media as well.

Portugal has gone through over 5 years of harsh austerity measures now, has much lower salaries, let alone pensions than the Greek (although the cost of living is lower as well) and have been forced to borrow Greece money through the ECB, like all other European countries. The prospect of not seeing that money back is especially painful for a country like Portugal, that has very little itself.

That being said, I still do not understand why Portugal (the politicians) plead for such a harsh stance on Greece myself, being in a very similar situation economically and having first hand experience on how years of Austerity can literally drain a country dry (young portuguese are forced abroad to find jobs, the population in most parts of the country is decreasing), but I also don't understand such a stance from Germans for that matter. They have historical experience with what unpayable debts can do to a country.

In the Netherlands we have a saying. ""You can't pluck feathers from a bald chicken"".

&gt; And now that tax money should be sent to Greece, where everyone is dodging taxes? No thanks.

&gt; Yes, because the utterly incompetent Tsipras put a deal into a vote, that did not exist. And the creditors had the responsibility to tell the Greek people that, because Syriza was not doing it. I don't know what the Greeks thought they were voting for, but the text, as written in their ballots, was wholly nonsensical. How could they possible know what they're voting for?

&gt; The only difference is that it wouldn't be Tsipras negotiating.

Those are all your statements, verbatim. And yes, they made me angry. 

What in the world makes you think any of these are okay things to think? Or that they are rational, intelligent, or justifiable opinions?

You gave the Creditors carte blanche to intervene in a sovereign state's democratic process solely because you think their government, whom they elected, isn't good enough, and you thus need to do it for them. 

You justify the Creditors (mainly Germany) actively seeking a regime change in a neighbour state because you don't approve of the government. Whereas most people just think badly of people they don't like, you stand by while the Creditors escalate this to active intent to topple a democratic government.

You treat the people of Greece as if they were lazy, corrupt, and stupid. As if they were incapable of understanding what was put to them in a political question, as if they were incapable of understanding the consequences of voting a certain way, as if they would simply be duped if the Creditors didn't help them by redefining the meaning of the entire process. 

You personally make sweeping statements about the character of Greek people, tarring them all with the same brush, and take no notice of all the innocent actually harmed. You think all Greeks are guilty, and thus all Greeks should be punished. It's all a very simplified narrative and belief on your part about Greeks being corrupt. 

Worst of all of those, you honestly believe you, and by extension those you support, have the special right to know what is true and what is not, and to then to execute that truth, even if it conflicts with common standards of behaviour and even with law.

You supported the idea that it's okay to for Creditors to be involved in a foreign election to them, in some other state's democracy. It's not, it's unacceptable. 

You supported the idea that you can use financial pressure to topple a democratically elected government because they dare to challenge you, and because you hate that government. That's wrong.

You support the idea that it's okay to believe something about a whole group of people just because they are a group. It's not. It's prejudice. It's racist.

And you think all of the other acts, including these--the lying about the IMF report, the demand for 'reforms' the Creditors **know** are bad for Greece etc--are perfectly fine because you have Truth on your side and yours is the morality that overrides what others consider to be ethical. 

It's fundamentalist, extremist, behaviour 101. It disgusts me. 

You can accuse me of anger, and emotion, and I'll happily take that. Extremists and racists make me angry. 

You can accuse me of hate, but I don't hate you. I hate what you believe, and I hate what you do. I am willing to tell you what an awful person you appear to be. And I say this not in a trolling kind of way. As evidence by your beliefs, as written in your words, I think you are a bad person, and that you need to work on it.

Okay, let me tell you why you (your country) don't find sympathy at all among any country east of Germany... The way your situation is seen (and portrayed by media) over here is a bit like that - Imagine two guys living next to each other. One is getting up at 6am to go to work on bike ( he can't afford a car) and brings home 500$/mo after working 10 hours a day. The other took out a bunch of loans, lives in house with pool, collects 1200$/mo in welfare benefits while sitting on his ass, and greets you with ""hehe, only suckers go to work"" everytime they see you returning tired from job. Then, when bank forecloses his house and gets him evicted, he calls TV to cry about how he's being ""oppresed"" and gets assigned subsidized housing that is STILL better than the one you're living in and his unemployment benefits are STILL bigger than your salary.

I'm not going to elaborate whether such depiction is correct or not - it's just how it looks from the side over here.

EDIT: Yes, I know it isn't true, and the situation is much more complicated, I just wanted to show you how the media pictures it over here. The fact is, you guys got framed into very nasty narrative, and at this point facts don't seem to matter anymore. If you bombard population for a few months with stories about pedophiles getting disability funds in Greece or state-employed Greeks receiving 400EUR/mo fund addition just for washing hands ([source for both](http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/swiat/artykuly/374771,jestes-pedofilem-ekshibicjonista-albo-hazardzista-to-dostaniesz-rente-w-grecji.html) ) or largest newspaper publishing polandball comic [like this](http://wyborcza.pl/1,135334,18273505,Andrzejrysuje_pl_dla_Wyborcza_pl___29_06_2015.html) (caption reads ""Greece, will you leave Eurozone?""

It's unlikely that they took into account spousal partners and refugees because the information on that is extremely poorly collected and distributed. Most of the information comes from the censuses, but those censuses only ask about things like age, religion and number of household occupants. They don't ask about visa statements so far as I know. It means the information is separated between different departments in many different countries and therefore the information can't be put back together again easily.

Now I don't claim intimate knowledge of the fineries but as far as I've understood, countries cannot go bankrupt the way citizens and companies can. Defaulting for a country means they are unable to honor their commitments at the moment but debt isn't going anywhere.

As for whether banks would accept Drachma, as far as I've understood, they would accept it when it's Greece's official currency.

&gt;Without the euro, greece has a long way to drop before they reach their equilibrium.

If historical GDP progression is a valid marker, current GDP is pretty much in line with pre-Euro progression if you disregard the bubble caused by EZ and cheap loans.

Only good thing Euro really did for Greece was cheap loans and cheap imports (and convenience ofc). Their trade balance is massively deficit and inability to devalue the currency hurts them. Local business' have no chance to compete against cheap imports and they can't cash in cheap exports.

It's difficult to say how long it'll take for them to bounce back but some countries have managed to do it very fast indeed.

&gt;If greece can leave and default and use monopoly money, then what stops others from doing the exact same thing?

It's true. Heavily indebted countries may do the same. Portugal, Spain especially. Maybe Italy but they might stick with the EZ. But I don't share your fatalism. It'll create ephemeral trust deficit and lower Euro value. That helps export business and they really do need a leg up. And then, after a time, value will rise again. A lot worse has happened in the past without fatal ramifications. Like Nixon Shock.

&gt;So the EU and the EZ is risky?

Can you open up your critique on EU? EZ covers only a portion of EU countries and I don't see how it's relevant here. EU doesn't share the EZ risk.

But EZ is risky. I think EZ has to move towards fiscal union in mid term and thus towards federalization or break up. Or it'll shake with every economic downturn because economically weaker countries can't compensate trade imbalance with currency manipulation.

Austerity is a policy, it isn't a natural circumstance. You stop austerity by literally declaring it over. 

Regarding your data, countries under actual austerity, like [Spain](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/NAEXKP03ESA657S#), [Portugal](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/NAEXKP03PTA652S), [Italy](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/NAEXKP03ITQ189S), [Ireland](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/NAEXKP03IEQ189S), or [Greece](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/NAEXKP03GRQ661S) show a moderate to sharp *decline* in government spending as percentage GDP. Do we have to compare these to actual GDP development, child poverty, deprivation, or any other measure of the life of the people there and the health of their economy, or can we agree that more austerity clearly didn't help?

The Portuguese stock market took a worse hit than when our biggest and oldest bank failed a year ago, together with the associated financial group. This was the worse day in 2 years, when our government was about to fall. The financials in particular lost ~10%. 

Remember also that much of the situation in Greece had been factored in some markets. The Portuguese PSI 20 is down ~16% since April. Also while the bond market is being held by QE, the CDS's (credit default swaps), are at they [highest ever](http://economico.sapo.pt/noticias/risco-da-divida-portuguesa-atinge-maximo-recorde_80067.html).  

But this isn't just about short term. This is bound to happen again, without a fiscal/transfer union weaker economies will continue to be at a disadvantage and fragile. And external factors cannot be controlled. Someone will eventually be in trouble and a precedent will be set. 

The Portuguese debt is known not to be sustainable. To pretend it is we'd need unrealistically consistent levels of growth (&gt;2%). Not happening. Even less likely to happen Greece leaves the Euro, and investors become weary of putting too much money in Portugal. And if our yields rise with a Greek exit. By the way, we were getting a lot of investment from Angola... they are in trouble due to oil prices. And from China... not good news from there lately.

If a developing economy that requires high(ish) interest rates joins the Euro while the ECB is keeping rates low for the benefit of the core economies, like they did for Germany 2001-2004 then money is going to flood into those countries and pump up credit bubbles, typically in real estate.

Sort of, we were the cowboy type, I studied a specialist kind of feedback maths, that falls under the catch all known as Systems Identification, this was quite hard to I took a bunch of Computer Science which was my natural ability to ensure I graduated university with a top grade.

Then I had an on the job and series of vocational qualifications in financial modelling, I've still not got round to doing my MSc, but it's on the list.

My job was to design models that represented the correlation between certain parts of the derivatives market, indices and the component underlying equities.

So yeah, I'm the hobbyist kind.

&gt; Yes. Tourism, and production in general.

Ok, this is why I don't share your optimism.  I don't think that a devaluation of 50% will see a massive upswing in tourism.  I'd say the demand curve was being limited by the supply side before this happened, so little will change.  You can't massively expand the tourism whilst keeping high margin types, you don't want to get caught into a race to be the next *Costa Del Sol*, it's not very profitable for the average worker.

&gt;  Pretty sure if their debts are cleared they're pretty economically stable.

Again, I don't share your optimism, history seldom has examples of the economy being stable after such things, inflation and hyperinflation instead are the common trend.

&gt; Why would you assume they won't be?

Because I don't have any compulsion to believe that there is a good, happy, moral solution.  You don't treat cancer patients as if the situation must be just, don't treat an economic one that way either.  If you default completely, your future borrowing costs will be high, very, very high.  So that means you've got to self fund, which is hard, because your economy is going down, which means that you've got to cut spending, which will in turn contract the economy...

The reason nothing was submitted is because he's gotta go back to his team and put them onto paper, and because he's gotta make it look like whatever it contains were his ideas. Likewise, if there's any compromise from Creditors, he's got to get it all in there and right on the first go. 

I think everyone is tired of haggling, and this is really a last shot--all or nothing.

You raise a lot of good points throughout your post, this is where I disagree with you - the reason Europe said no to higher taxation on gambling was exactly because the gambling sector *worked* in Greece. They refused the changes, at least on this occasion, because it could have potentially damaged one of the remaining actually-efficient sector in Greece. Taxing it further would have further damaged Greece's economy more than it would have helped it.

&gt;When I read those hateful comments I wonder, do these people really understand what’s going on in Greece?

I think, having grown up during both the worst communism and capitalism had to offer in the late-80s and early-90s Romania, that most people really don't. And I shudder to think that *anybody* who went to through the despair that abject poverty of those times would ever want anybody else to go through that. It outrages me that anybody who knows what it's like to be *poor* would ever want that on anybody else, but, unfortunately, that's the mentality among many people from poorer countries. I have to admit, though, that the perceived Greek ""superiority complex"" to a lot of its Balkan neighbors hasn't helped opinion, but I would think that empathy would triumph...

That being said, I disagree that there's *a lot* of hatred towards Greece going on in /r/europe. I don't deny that it exists or that it's a problem, that should be obvious to anyone in my opinion. But I disagree it's an endemic view around here. Sure, there are idiots and mean spirited people, but most of what I've seen is mostly something akin to ""disappointment"" rather than outright hatred. A lot of people blame *only* Greece, and they're wrong, but they're usually corrected fairly quickly, from what I've observed.

Considering all the other stuff we export we will likely be able to pay for the energy we need. We do a lot of innovation in terms of sustainable energy and medicine, which are areas with high demand prospects for decades to come.

null,false,wheinstein,null,null,null,"&gt; What in the world makes you think any of these are okay things to think? Or that they are rational, intelligent, or justifiable opinions?

Yes:

* ""The referendum was nonsensical"": The question asked whether the Greece should accept a deal which, 1) was not finalized (it was one particular basis for negotiation), and 2) was not applicable at the time of voting since the bailout framework to which it pertained had elapsed.
* ""the actions that the creditors would have to take in response to a NO would have dire consequences to Greece"": We are seeing this happening right at this very moment. The only thing keeping Greek banks from collapsing and taking the whole state with them is ELA from ECB. As a response to the vote, the ECB was forced to tighten the rules, effectively limiting access to liquidity. This is felt by the ordinary Greeks as bank closures and empty ATMs with limited withdrawals. Further, NO means there is no basis for a quick agreement since the Eurozone position and the NO position are too far apart. The consequence is likely to be that the banks remain closed, ECB will be forced to completely cut the ELA, and Greece is forced to switch to another currency. These are the dire consequences to Greece.
* ""And now that tax money should be sent to Greece, where everyone is dodging taxes? No thanks."": You yourself quoted a figure that 6/10 Greeks have not paid their taxes. Elsewhere in Eurozone 90-98% of taxes are collected. Those are the taxes that Greece wants access to through the bailouts. Why do you think that is an acceptable demand?
* ""the creditors had the responsibility to tell the Greek people that, because Syriza was not doing it"": Syriza leadership was claiming that voting NO would lead to a quick agreement on better terms and no chance of Euro exit. Those are *false* claims. Given that the Greek government is seeking *my tax money* through bailouts, I absolutely want my representatives to tell the Greek people that what Syriza is saying is simply not true. We're seeing that right now. The bank closures are extended, ELA access tightened, no deal in sight, and all but two Eurozone countries are in favor of Grexit. In other words the complete opposite of what Syriza claimed in their campaigning. The Greek people had the right to know the true state of the affairs, and it was the responsibility of the creditors to tell them that since their own government was not doing it.
* ""the text, as written in their ballots, was wholly nonsensical"": The ballot asked if the Greeks would accept a proposal that did not exist. That is, by definition, nonsensical.

In the rest of your post you just make false accusations about me. These are not true:

* ""You justify the Creditors (mainly Germany) actively seeking a regime change in a neighbour state"": Nowhere did I say anything to support regime change.
* ""You treat the people of Greece as if they were lazy, corrupt, and stupid. As if they were incapable of understanding what was put to them in a political question"": I said nothing of the kind about the Greek people. I said the *question on the ballots* was nonsensical, and therefore there is no way for anyone to know what they are voting for.
* ""You personally make sweeping statements about the character of Greek people"": Such as? The only thing close to a ""sweeping statement"" was to claim that tax dodging was endemic and that *everyone* was involved. This was based on the data you yourself provided.
* ""You supported the idea that you can use financial pressure to force to topple a democratically elected government"": I did no such thing.
* ""It's fundamentalist, extremist, behaviour 101. It disgusts me."": That's because your completely misrepresenting my arguments, and then get angry and filled hate based on it.
* ""As evidence by your beliefs, as written in your words, I think you are a bad person, and that you need to work on it."": That's fine.

The Euro is known from the very beginning not to have a solid foundation, and these problems were predicted long ago. It was just the confirmation. With a Greek exit the Euro will be looked at more as a pegged currency. 

Not only will the currency lose confidence, but also the weaker economies. It's not just their yields will rise (which they will), but that their markets will be much more volatile. Any sign of trouble will trigger very nervous reactions. 

The debt of Portugal is not sustainable. To pretend it is we'd need unrealistically consistent levels of growth (&gt;2%). Not happening. Even less likely to happen Greece leaves the Euro, and investors become weary of putting too much money in Portugal. We have deadlines coming in 2017 and 2018. 

What is now a very serious social problem in Greece, will turn into calamity, and that will affect Europe. Particular neighbour countries, but not only. We will have to provide some help. 

Their borders will be less controlled, and the flux of refugees/illegal immigrants will increase. It also makes us much more vulnerable to terrorism. 

On the side of defence, their budget, which has been going down, will collapse. Even worse out of necessity and fuelled by anti-EU sentiment they will likely gravitate towards others, possibly Russia, putting us more are risk. Furthermore anti-EU sentiment and their demise will serve as a means of propaganda to Eurosepticism and extremist idelogies in the EU.  

There's the interesting possibility that we end up in a legal mess in Europe, as they may refuse to live the Union, while at the same time they are not allowed to leave the Euro nor issue a parallel currency with it. Even if that possibility is open by the reminder members they may refuse it and chose to fight it in court.

Using verbs that don't change in different formations and identifying what they are/how they function through context.

It's not fatalism. It's just interests and human behavior and historical precedences. And it's just the indebted nations like italy,spain. It's also countries like finland,estonia,germany,etc who would lose faith in the euro. 


&gt; It'll create ephemeral trust deficit and lower Euro value.

You keep harping on the ""value"" of the euro. Whether the euro is 1:1 or 1:1.3 against the dollar is immaterial. It's the TRUST in the euro as a viable currency. God damn, there are so many stupid morons on reddit. Currency ""value"" is relative and meaningless.

Nixon Shock wasn't worse. What an idiot. There's a difference between the nixon ""shock"" and the maine leaving the union and using their own currency. Now THAT would be a shock.

&gt; EZ covers only a portion of EU countries and I don't see how it's relevant here. 

EZ is relevant because we are talking about currency. The EZ is more important than the EU.

Of course it does. Eventually the goal is for all of EU to become EZ. EZ is the goal of the EU.

Thank you for your kind words.

The really interesting thing about it is that even the IWF thinks that a Haircut, so a cut of the Greece debt, might be necessary and good if certain criterias are met (bad growth etc.) which is AMAZING if you consider that Schäuble said that is not going to consider a haircut. Kinda funny actually. But this report was released after the talks about the newest proposal, between the talks and the referedum so it saidly didn't impact the talks on the referendum. (Greece wanted a haircut, the EU countries specificlly Germany and France not so much)

The other took out a bunch of loans, lives in house with pool, collects 1200$/mo in welfare benefits while sitting on his ass, and greets you with ""hehe, only suckers go to work"" everytime they see you returning tired from job. Then, when bank forecloses his house and gets him evicted, he calls TV to cry about how he's being ""oppresed"" and gets assigned subsidized housing that is STILL better than the one you're living in and his unemployment benefits are STILL bigger than your salary.
&gt; 

As another Eastern(south) European I don't agree with you. We are absolutly furious with your politicians and the way you keep voting the same morons who pull you by your noses and push you in the bigger hole  year after year. We are furious that we had to lend you money that we will now prolly never see again, although our wages and pensions are smaller than yours. We are fuirous with you guys that you don't want to do what you have to do and the excuse for that is that it wasn't your generation that did it. Which imo is the biggest lol ever. Guess which generation payed the price of fuck ups of our previous generations?  That said we don't hate Greeks, we are just pissed at you.

The problem is that someone needs to pay. We can call them loans, but everyone knows that money borrowed to Greece has a large risk if never being payed back, hence why Greece can't go anywhere but to the troika for cash. Meanwhile, the rest of the EU electorates are not interested in footing the bill for Greece maintaining public benefits that are beyond their own means, understandably, so they support potentially destructive cuts to be demanded in return for loans out of some sense of justice.

Don't know if it's the same all over Europe, but here you're supposed to take care of your elders and it's not looked with good eye if you send them to some home for elderly people. I think in the near past it was almost like taboo. Somehow people manage to do their job and to take care of the elders.... I guess this is because families are more... closer in southern countries. For example in other thread people from northern countries wondered how can man and women live with parents after having 18, for them it was strange and almost impossible.

 Well, now of course we have more such homes for elderly people and more and more kids are sending their parents in such places, which they are actually pleasant, with doctors and what not... 

Here we had such companies that made old people sign contracts for giving their homes after their death, it was for some money given every month, I think. Now it's not that popular and I havent heard of it since a long time. There probably are organizations who take care of elderly people for their home after death, but I'm not familiar. 

Sorry, we could talk about that with hours. What I meant was - here it's the usual way - kids taking care of parents/elders, and it's by default that they're getting everything as inheritance, probably as everywhere else. Sometimes, indeed, old people find young people outside the family to take care of them for their home after death.

Mi spiego: a Roma molti dei treni sono molto vecchi, inadeguati, anche rotti. Specie sulle ferrovie urbane (Roma Lido, Giardinetti) è la norma trovare treni senza aria condizionata (quando fanno 40° fuori) o che restano dieci minuti fermi in stazione perché l'impianto idraulico non funziona bene, quindi c'è qualche porta che non si chiude e bisogna restare fermi a provare a chiudere e riaprire finché non si può partire. Adesso per protesta i macchinisti non fanno partire i treni non sicuri: si arriva a Fermi e si scopre che una porta non si chiude? Non si sta fermi cinque minuti a riprovare, si fanno scendere i passeggeri e il treno va in deposito. Non funziona l'aria condizionata in uno dei vagoni dei treni nuovi? Si fanno scendere i passeggeri e il treno va in manutenzione, o molte volte non parte neanche e la corsa è soppressa. Inoltre, il numero dei macchinisti sulla A e sulla B non è sufficiente, e si va avanti solo a straordinari. Se però i macchinisti gli straordinari non li fanno, saa pijamo tutti 'nder secchio, come diceva mio nonno.

Se da una parte è un comportamento legale, è particolarmente ipocrita: la situazione dei treni il 1° luglio è la stessa del 30 giugno, ma prima nessuno faceva problemi.

null,false,KosherNazi,UNSA,United States of America,null,"&gt; By 1953 Germany had been under 8 years of military occupation, it's political and economic institutions having been completely overhauled - something (the overhaul) Greece refuses to commit to.

Can you give some specifics to refute the authors assertion?  Or is the nebulous ""completely overhauled"" supposed to say it all?  Because denazification didnt happen, and simply changing form of government isn't a catch-all fix for economic prosperity -- remember weimar?  What was the secret sauce that (the US imposed) which allowed such frenetic growth?  We know it wasn't austerity, what with all the money being thrown at the FRG by big bad america.

&gt; Helping Germany was in the geopolitical interest of the USA, considering how West Germany served as a bullwark against communism for the remainder of the cold war. It was not charity.

This is irrelevant -- the point is that everyone saw that austerity and reparations were not an option for economic growth.  The motives don't matter, the cause and effect relationship does.  Austerity does not lead to growth.  Germany has learned this lesson 5 times in the last hundred years -- Versailles, the deficit funded boom in the 30's, post-WW2, the billions spent on reunification, and then the early 2000's.  I can probably find more examples if i try.

&gt; The debt relief was not free: The Winners profited massively from forced labour of hundreds of thousands of German civilians and PoW's to work on farms or to clear minefields. 

Thanks for laying all those minefields so the victors could ""profit"" from their removal after the war, Germany!  Are you listening to yourself?

Britain and France kept POW's as forced labor through the very early 50's, and it was a very small number comparatively speaking.  I don't think this counts as profiting, nor does this jive with your assertion that externally imposed reforms are what fixed the German economy, unless you think a labor shortage is a good thing.

&gt; They also profited from the deportation of industrial capacity, German resources, patents and inventions. There were huge restrictions on German industrial sectors, on the amount and quality of steel they were allowed to use, there were regulations ensuring some resource exports were sold at 50% of value etc.

1) Alcuni particolari variano da regione a regione. Io mi limito a risponderti su quello che conosco (il SSN toscano). Il ticket si paga per gli ambulatori specialistici, per il pronto soccorso, e per i farmaci. Ci sono comunque diverse situazioni in cui si è esentati dal pagamento del ticket (es. a seconda del reddito, dell'età, se affetti da diverse patologie...); inoltre, il ticket solitamente ha un importo massimo (nel caso del PS, mi pare che sia 50 euro). Fondamentalmente, il ticket è un contributo del cittadino che serve solo in piccola parte a coprire le spese sanitarie della regione, più che altro serve a responsabilizzarlo. Cioè, non credere che quei 50 euro che hai pagato fossero il costo delle tue analisi o dei tuoi esami.

Having worked on a trading floor, none of this would be expected. The EMU has developed its anti-contagion mechanisms since 2010.

Uncertainty prompts ""flights to safety"". When Ted Cruz's U.S. government shutdown, Treasury yields fell. This is why Bund yields are falling. The ECB, with the ESM and EFSF, are credible in their capacity to couple Eurozone rates.

Grexit has been priced into the Euro, Eurozone rates, national bourses and the implied volatility on options thereon. (Greek options have traded more like the Balkans than the Eurozone for more than a month now.) There will be idiot traders still surprised. But at worst, private participation in peripheral interbank lending will subside for a while. If anything, Grexit produces a coherent Eurozone, institutionally and economically. That *decreases* uncertainty. 

**EDIT**: I was an impolite Bayesian. You hold the view, with conviction, that Grexit will cause a Eurozone crisis of confidence and meltdown. This is a minority view in the financial markets. But if you're right, options across the continent are mis-priced. Would be willing to buy, with 10x leverage, a basket of Eurozone options?  If not, or not with significant leverage, consider that the unknowability of the outcome is a two-tailed distribution.

Austerity is also fine to decrease government debt if GDP growth can not outgrow debt growth, so that past debts can not be repaid, but it is the wrong instrument to fix the problems that arise due to recession. Governmental debt in a recession doesn't even tell you that much about how sustainable governmental spending is normally. Austerity looks at government income during a recession, then forces spending cuts or increased taxation that prevents giving the economy an economic stimulus, deepening the recession, and then everybody is surprised that the debt/GDP ratio is rising. The problem isn't the debt (or not solely), but the depressed GDP. 

It's really not that trivial to compare that to personal finances, but imagine you were the owner of a company that doesn't do too well. There's two things that might work, you could increase productivity, or cut employees. You decide on the latter, and this works, you are working your way towards a primary surplus. But the problem is that meanwhile your production has faltered to such an extent that you can't actual service the debt you already accrued, and eventually your company goes under. It would have been preferable to get the employees to work more or be more productive, so that your revenue can get higher and service your debt, and once you managed to get through the recession, you could work on decreasing spending so that your debt can't easily get that high again.

That's an imperfect analogy, of course, and I'm not an economist and am largely repeating what I read, but it's better than

D'aucuns diront que ça fait donc longtemps qu'on promènent les grecs sur ce sujet mais c'était bien supposé faire parti d'un 3ème plan de sauvetage une fois le memorandum du second appliqué.

It's a combination of fundamental misunderstanding of economics and classic ingroup/outgroup dynamics compounded by bigotry, which is maintaining a very dangerous sentiment among the voters in the important non-Greek EU countries, especially the Western European ones. 

All I ever hear in NL politics, media, and casual conversations is this narrative about how suffering and tightening belts is the solution to a depression brought on by laziness and incompetence, and how the Greeks are just parasites trying to constantly take free money from 'us'. 

The economic ignorance is a result of widespread faulty basic assumptions about how macro-economics should work. It's very hard to shake the idea that it is just like your household finances. The reality is counter-intuitive, which makes it very hard for politicians to argue against the rhetoric of populist politicians calling on Greece to 'pay back our money'.

Add to this an undercurrent of bigotry, anchored in stereotypes of Greeks and Southern Europeans being lazy and corrupt, and a political class of ambitious self-serving leaders who lack the courage to explain that the unpopular policy - to stop senseless austerity package and accept the economic reality - is the right way to go, and you have a situation where professional negotiators are given the task to score a number of points - make it look like the Greeks don't get off easily - and you get the situation we're in now.

That, to me, explains the motivations of the Eurogroup position. In order to understand their irrationality and myopia, you have to understand that it's a chain of individuals working for their own limited self-interested goals, and not a group of people having the best interest of the entirety of the EU at heart.

the fact that the debt burden is so low, is the reason why it is sustainable. if it was 20% of GDP per year, it would be unsustainable. 5% is doable.

Neither of these numbers are correct. Greece lost 25%, portugal lost about 15%.  
Then again, we finished a 76MM euro program, you guys needed what, over 200MM and a debt haircut?  
  
Honestly, i think the solution should be the following. An intermediate program goes into effect, which a strict set of rules that Greece has to follow.   
If Greece follows through, and completes all requirements of such a program, they get a debt haircut and a longer program, still with some austerity, but since the debt is gone, it shouldn't require as much as it does now. Granted, greece will be out of the markets for years and years and years, but such is the price you guys decided to pay.  
However,  
If Greece does NOT follow through with the reforms of the intermediary program, there will be no further agreements, no debt haircut, and Greece leaves the eurozone.

Are you serious? First [here are the yields for 10-year bonds](https://i.imgur.com/Ry8XsUf.png) of Germany, Portugal and Greece. Look at them exploding in 2012. 

But lets say you believe it's much better now, since 2012. Our 10 year bond yield jumped from ~1.5 to 3.1 since March. And while the bond market is being held by QE, the CDS's (credit default swaps), are at they [highest ever](http://economico.sapo.pt/noticias/risco-da-divida-portuguesa-atinge-maximo-recorde_80067.html). 

As for stocks, with the greek announcement of the referendum, the Portuguese stock market took a worse hit than when our biggest and oldest bank (together with the associated financial group) failed a year ago. This was the worse day in 2 years, when our government was about to fall. The financials in particular lost ~10%. Also remember also that much of the situation in Greece had been factored in some markets. The Portuguese PSI 20 is down ~16% since April.

This has more to do with how their education system is structured - it is different from the west and what we would consider a ""Technical Degree"" like college entry programs they consider a tertiary degree. When analyzed the age group 35-39 only 20% or so were found to have been college educated with Bachelors or more.
* They have to import talent because the Irish population cannot keep up with the demands of multinationals in terms of raw skills output aswell as some graduates of prestigious universities all over Europe finding it easy to be hired. I find it fascinating that skilled and educated workers being welcomed and finding it easy to relocate to Ireland to work in High-Tech companies os a bad thing.
* Even Zero Hour contract workers are protected under the [Organisation of Working Time Act 1997](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html) Which states that even on a zero hour contact where the employee is offered no work during a given week they are entitled to 25% or 15 hours of work whichever is lesser worth of pay. IE if you are expected to do 40 hours a week, you are entitled to 10 hours pay even if you work 0 hours in a given week. If you worked 5 hours of a required 40, an additional 5 would be payed to make sure you reached the 25% baseline. 
* Once again on Zero Hour contracts, I am in fact an employer in an industry that has seasonal spikes in employmeny demand who uses Zero Hour Contracts because of this. They are extremely important for certain Industries(Like construction which usually has a lul in late winter and spring) as I can keep skilled men on retainer for low cost and have a pool of manpower and labour that can scale to the demands of the week/month. Without Zero Hour Contracts my salary costs would be significantly higher and my business would have massive cash flow problems in the winter/Spring months. Just because they are being abused by industries and Employers who dont *need* them doesn't mean they are bad - Simply that more provisions and protections need to be provisions for 0 hour workers in non-seasonally affected industries.
* At least the people who I employ negotiated higher salaris as the burden on workers in these contracts higher than when they were traditionally employed. And yes, they voluntarily took the offer of these Zero Hour contracts because it was beneficial for them to do so, during the seasonal dip they can ply their skills freelance while still earning 25% minimum.",null,0,null,1436292762,null,0,false,0,csv8aix,null,t3_3celhi,null,t1_csv8aix,null,t1_csv3s6e,null,null,null,1437661934,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

&gt; Es ist ganz offen, was daraus wird. Warten wir mal die nächsten Wahlen in Spanien oder Frankreich ab – auch Länder mit einer langen, wirtschaftsfernen Tradition, wo ein Großteil der Bevölkerung den Kapitalismus nur zähneknirschend akzeptiert. Wenn wir den Griechen jetzt wieder mehr Geld geben, ist das eine unmittelbare Wahlhilfe für die Linken.

Diese Linken! Die wollen wohl noch Arbeitnehmerrechte und soziale Leistungen vom Staat? So wie die SPD? *Würg*

&gt;&gt; Fehlt den Griechen nicht auch das Spar-Gen?  

&gt; Nein. Die ticken nur anders: Es gibt nur ein niedriges soziales Vertrauen in die Gesellschaft. Viele Griechen finden nichts dabei, sich gegenseitig oder den Staat zu betrügen, solange es nicht Verwandte oder Freunde trifft. 

Diese Leute, die den Kapitalismus nicht mögen, weil sie kein Spar-Gen haben und sich deswegen lieber gegenseitig in die Pfanne hauen...na klar! Bei der Frage der Bild bröckelt dann die Kotze auf die Hose bei mir...

It basically says, ""well, our assumptions in May 2014 where quite rosy, funny that that didn't turn out the way we thought it would"". There are a few stabs at Syriza, but it's not much. And keep in mind that Syriza has only been in the government since January this year. Everything before is not their responsibility.

According to the report, responsible for the newly arisen need to re-financing are: 

* lower fiscal targets
* lower privatization proceeds
* lower economic growth
* paying arrears (basically bills somehow nobody had kept in mind)
* higher interest rates

The report in May 2014 really was a best-case scenario, and an unrealistic at that. I love this passage: *""There is a substantial weakening in the delivery of structural reforms and in the reform commitments. This has made untenable the assumption until the last review that Greece would go from having the lowest average TFP growth in the euro area since it joined the EU in 1981 to having among the highest TFP growth, and that it would go to the highest labor force participation rates and to German employment rates"" (p. 5).* Yeah, not shit Sherlock. Totally unexpected.

When you do project management, and you only plan for the best case (with highly questionnable assumptions), and it goes wrong: I'd say it's your fault as project leader. 

edit. another nugget: *""If the program were implemented as specified at the last review, debt servicing would 
have been within the recommended threshold of 15 percent of GDP on average during 2016–45. This would require primary surpluses of 4+ percent of GDP per year and decisive and full implementation of structural reforms that delivers steady state growth of 2 percent per year (with the best productivity growth in the euro area) and privatization.""

The Greek crisis (and by extension, Greece and Greeks) is a big slap in the face towards that project. You are showing that the European dream in practice can be a nightmare. It is unsurprising that the people who bring this message get a lot of hatred.

Heh, if this were true, I wouldn't have nearly as many heated arguments as I do on this subreddit. Believing that the entire community is opposed to you is part of every redditor's personal bias. For me, it would be very easy to see this subreddit as a nest of conservative nationalists and war hawks. There's only a handful of users that I can name off the top of my head that I usually agree with.

On an unrelated note, I disagree that the Greek crisis is a slap in the face of the European project, but rather, a slap in the face of the parts of implementation of that project and recent leadership. Such a monumental endeavor is bound to experience quite a few serious set-backs, but to suggest that they undermine the overarching idea would be wrong. There is no easy path to European unity. Transitioning out of the nation state era in a continent where the trenches between nation states have been dug long and deep is going to be incredibly painful one way or the other.

And finally, leaving a project like this in the hands of conservative politicians would certainly not be my first choice. It's been a bumpier road than it could have been, but such is life.

Perhaps today an agreement will be reached in which Greece just signs anything that the rEurozone demands, so that Greece gets further loans to pay off its current loans, meanwhile none of the fundamental problems really get solved and this farce continues for a few more years.

That's the case if Greece opts to stay in the euro at all costs, in that case the situation will deteriorate a few more years and they'll probably get around to it eventually, at great cost to Greece.

&gt;We have known for the last five years that the Greek debt has to be written off. It would have made a lot more sense to write it off five years ago, at a time it was held by banks, who had made poor investments. 

A financial system bailout would stilll have been necessary, but at least then it would have happened in the open, and then we'd have an entirely different narrative.

&gt;Now it is mostly held by eurozone taxpayers.

There is a way out of that, but it would require a 180° change of plan on behalf of Germany (allowing the ECB to fund the ESM). Looking at if from the bright side, Merkel has done that before. If the fresh ECB credit money is used too to reimburse the original contribution the eurozone states made, however, that would constitute a multibillion trophy (getting their money back) that should soothe the pain of betraying their monetary principles. And it's not like they didn't change tack on QE either, or even the existence of the ESM. It did take time.

But in case Greece refuses further treatment of the moribund patient, things could escalate. If the markets start to move, it'll force the issue either way, just like the ESM. Interesting times.

&gt;The voters are not going to take this for ever. Sooner or later they will get their revenge.

Tourist cities like Krakow, Poznan, Gdansk, Wroclaw are in my experience quite welcoming and a foreign-looking person is indistinguishable from a crowd, sort of like the experience in any Western European city. (extrapolating for Poznan, never been there unfortunately.)

The moment you go outside those cities however, I've found that I am definitely ""noticed"" on the street much more. People look at you funny, or sometimes stare. It is nothing too bad nor is it borne from intolerance or racism or anything like that, I think it is just that they are not used to seeing someone who looks different. My father's city, Katowice, was especially bad for this which is unsurprising as despite it being a massive city it is primarily industrial with little tourism.

Warsaw is similar to the tourist cities but a little less friendly I've found. I've always chalked it up to the large number of internal migration from smaller Polish towns to the capital city, searching for work. That's just my hypothesis.

Anyway, this is not quite the same as 'understanding' immigrants from radically different cultures, but the point I'm trying to make is that there is probably varying levels of openness to immigration and integration within Poland itself and we shouldn't be so hasty to paint the entire country under one brush.",null,0,null,1436293779,null,0,false,0,csv910m,null,t3_3cf9a4,null,t1_csv910m,null,t1_csv0spo,null,null,null,1437662328,null,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9,null

In the list of [trading partners](https://www.destatis.de/EN/FactsFigures/NationalEconomyEnvironment/ForeignTrade/TradingPartners/Tables/OrderRankGermanyTradingPartners.pdf?__blob=publicationFile), Greece ranks #38 in export partners with an export value of 5bn EUR and #47 in import partners with an import value of 1.7bn EUR. Compared to the GDP of 3850bn, that's not very much.

I seem to recall that German private banks hold about 10bn of Greek bonds, that would hit hard, but probably would not necessitate a new banking bailout.

I doubt the German economy suffers very much from the uncertainties around Greece - the ECB intervention to weaken the EUR has less to do with Greece than with keeping the other program countries afloat (Greece is not part of the QE). If anything, the weak EUR helps the German economy.

Germany has pledged about 50bn EUR in ESFS and ESM funds. It would have to recapitalize the ECB to the tune of 15bn if I understand right and would probably suffer another 80bn in TARGET II money loss if Greece defaulted. That's not spare change but entirely doable without any danger for the AAA-rating.

Indirect effects like a breakup of the EUR zone or contagion to Spain, Italy and Portugal are hard to quantify.

What we're currently looking at in this clusterfuck: after Greece let the second EFSF bailout program expire there's little hope of a quick solution. 

The current word is (rumour):  
Greece is probably going to ask for bridge financing to take them over July and a couple of months after that.

The situation has changed institutionally and within banks since then. Here are the Eurozone curves from today, a week ago and a month ago: [1]. Yields have decreased across the board.

&gt; [Portugal's] 10 year bond yield jumped from ~1.5 to 3.1 since March

Yes, a 3.17% 10-year yield is higher than the 1.57% 2015 YTD low. On an absolute basis, however, it's sustainable. Notice the relatively smooth, linear increase from the end of March to today? That's calm re-pricing. Same in the options markets.

&gt; [Portugese sovereign] CDS's (credit default swaps), are at they [*sic*] highest ever.

Portugese debt is riskier than German debt. Rates options aren't pricing in much volatility because the ECB credibly stands ready to re-couple rates in Portugal to those in Germany. That can only go on for so long. On Sunday the FT reported that ""folllowing a banking union,"" Schäuble ""wants joint institutions, including a permanent administration and a eurozone parliament"" [2]. If those integrations fail to emerge, yes, we will see further pain in Europe. 

&gt; it's what happens when we reach the deadlines in 2017 and 2018 and can't pay.

European governments won't be happy about writing off 3% of their GDP over the years on account of Athens. People will get upset. But stability-wise, it's a non-issue. As for the private sector (*e.g.* banks), only 17% of Greek debt is held there [3]. These holdings have long been marked down. Non-payment would meet expectations.

I don't think many people would argue that, following the financial crisis, fiscal stimulus in the UK and the US hasn't positively affected growth in the short term. I agree that it's a very effective tool to counter economic downturns in the short run - especially at the ZLB. I also agree that austerity was partly responsible for a very severe contraction of Greek GDP.

However, that's not the case to be argued here. Greece is over-indebted and cannot support a big stimulus package on its own. It solely relies on lenders of **last resort** to even fulfill the liabilities they already have. It also cannot conduct an independent monetary policy because they are just one small country in a big Eurozone. We aren't talking about the US or the UK here because the prerequisites are completely different - from an economic and an institutional point of view.

It is out of question that fiscal stimuli might help in the short run but there just is no room for that because Greece is not able to raise capital. Greece needs the same thing every country that was affected by similar circumstances has already done: Medium- and long-term structural changes. Just take a look at Latvia. They were hugely affected by austerity. GDP contracted severely. It was not austerity that took them back on track (how could it?), it was reforms. And that's exactly what the IMF is advocating for: ""Conduct reforms that will grant you growth in the long term because fiscal policy would only help you in the short term and then things return just to where they are now. And once we believe your reforms are sufficient to have that effect, we will talk about how to help you in the short term via debt restructuring.""",null,0,null,1436294152,null,0,1436294665,0,csv9ah0,null,t3_3cfztd,null,t1_csv9ah0,null,t1_csv64qo,null,null,null,1440493891,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

What exactly do you mean when you talk about an imbalanced monetary union?

I do not think that the problem has to arise again. There are going to be problems within the union because of the different competitiveness of the countries, but as long as they are not super severe these can be managed. For example with transfers - as they already happen - for weaker regions. The problem that countries like Spain and Italy are having right now are also caused by a too low competitiveness, which can be fixed in the mid and long term.

Especially since the financial market failed too during that situation. Countries like Spain and particularly Greece should never have been able to supply themselves so easily and with such a low interest rate with money. This is not going to happen again, because investor learned that just because a country is in a Euro zone it does not mean that their bonds are always secure. In the future this very important aspect will prevent other countries from going way up into debt with a low interest rate, which was a terrible thing, since it made the fall that much harder and prevented IMPORTANT reforms that the countries should have conducted earlier. Arguably they might have conducted them earlier, if the interest rates would have been more realistic in the past - just because they would have had to.

Those jobs are not there because Ireland has such a skilled pool of Swedish and Danish speaker, those jobs are there as it's cheaper to have the job in Ireland with low taxes and persuade people who otherwise would be hired for those jobs in their own regions to move to Dublin.

Now I'm not an employer so I can't comment on the zero hours and how some less honest employers exploit it but in my opinion the lack or regulation on the digital economy is killing jobs in ever nation more expensive than Ireland now and so our place in the european union seems to be stagnation until everyone is the same.

call me elitist if you want but I don't want our country and it's institutions reduced to the Continental level, if we need to cut this free trade to protect our own digital economies than maybe we need to do that but to me this europe is not one that serves out interests all all but only seeks to undermine our relatively successful states, it's not Ireland's fault for taking advantage either, neither is it the fault of Greece for bankers debts. 

totally off topic but to keep our own shit in check and look after our own problems in our own respect I've countries the EU seems to just be a sticking block now rather than a help.

I can't say much on the zero hours use by decent employers but I can say if work is to be done it will be done regardless of how many staff you personally can have on retainer, temp staff is how we traditionally solved that problem. I see no reason why employees should be kept on constant call and expected to work at a moments notice, it sounds like neo slavery to me. What we hear about more is how it's abused and while I don't have the cost benefit analysis I subjectively think there are more downsides than plus sides and we have now been experimenting with them here too.

You can find many sources on the internet about how generous the greek governments have been in the past decades in terms of welfare and social policies, but that's not all of it. For many years corruption was not fought enough, and it spread on all levels, up to the point where [(source)](http://users.uoa.gr/~ahatzis/Hatzis_2012_09.pdf):    

&gt; [...] Even in 2010, some 40 percent of Greeks did not pay any tax and about 95 percent of tax returns were for less than €30,000 a year. Such widespread tax evasion cost the state budget an estimated €20–30 billion per year, i.e., at least two-thirds of the deficit for 2009.    

Please be aware that the recent crisis (that i'd like to remember to everyone here is the rotten fruit of the indiscriminate capitalistic policies adopted in the U.S.) has brought each and every government to adopt unfavorable policies, among which there are several spending cuts (mostly public services, pensions cuts, raise of requirements for pension eligibility, and so on) that really angered the citizens all over Europe. Now you can see as how, in the eyes of the other European citizens, having additional taxes (because in the end the money will always come from the taxpayers) to help the Greece is hardly acceptable [when the Greeks themselves give the impression of still enjoying luxurious welfare bonuses](http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/12/04/75-of-greek-pensioners-enjoy-early-retirement/); and it doesn't help all the (mis?)information from the media picturing them as spoiled people who are not willing to make enough sacrifices to get in line to the standards of all the other countries, while keep asking all the other nations to force their citizens to make even more sacrifices in order not only to improve the economy of their country, but to pay for the Greek mess too.

Just a few corrections by a german, if I may. ;)

I'd say ""Es ist anzumerken"" or ""Es ist zu beachten"", ""Es ist bemerkenswert"" is more ""It's amazing"" than ""It's noteworthy.

After the Ehevisum your relative sentence starts of weirdly. I'd say ""womit"" instead of ""dabei"" because you're trying to explain what the Ehevisum allows them.

Then it should be ""unter alle*n* Bedingungen"", Bedingung is female (for whatever weird reason).

* That the whole issue is so complex and complicated that it is unrealistic to expect the broad population to be appropriately informed. To stay informed, you eventually have to read original documents. I'm only doing this now because I'm on vacation and have time to do it, and also because I'm rather used to read dense documents with lots of technical details. So what do people do? Rely on a large brush narrative (either delivered from the right or the left), because we have this itching desire for consistency, causality, closure. 
* That we, as a transnational society, have not figured out a way to deal with such complexity within a democracy. And this shows in this crisis. Here's a brilliant piece on that: http://www.philosophersbeard.org/2010/11/democracy-is-not-truth-machine.html
* That (my feeling) we see an insane rise of nationalism. There are seriously arguments based on assumed qualities of ""The Greeks"", ""The Germans"" etc. When I look at quotes and Tweets from German politicians, I'm just at a loss of words. (It's not just German politicians, unfortunately.)

&gt; Der Glaubwürdigkeit deiner Position würden Sachargumente besser dienen

Meine Argumente hatte ich schon gebracht. Hier nochmal für dich, ganz klar aus dem Text herausgehauen:

1. Eine naturwissenschaftliche Ablehnung philosophischer Thesen ist von vorneherein zum Scheitern verurteilt, weil auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen argumentiert wird.
2. Es ist nicht Aufgabe eines Anhängers einer Weltanschauung, auf Befehl einem aggressiv auftretenden Antitheisten naturwissenschaftlich belastbare Beweise (die es nicht geben kann, siehe 1) zu liefern.
2. Tollwütiger Antitheismus ist eigentlich nur dazu gut, das eigene Selbstbild hochzuhalten. Im Prinzip handelt es sich um die ""erwachsenere"" Form des Schulhof-Schlägers.

Und nochmal: Ich bin kein Antroposoph. Mich nervt nur die Art und Weise, wie gerade auf Reddit einige Wenige ihre angebliche geistige Überlegenheit dadurch zu präsentieren versuchen, indem sie eine ""nichtwissenschaftliche"" out-group zu ihrer ""erleuchteten naturwissenschaftlichen Herrenrasse"" (hier in Anlehnung an die PCMR, nicht an die Ideen des Dritten Reiches) schaffen. Was wir nicht brauchen ist *mehr* Tribalism.

Wir haben durch unsere Hilfe da unten die lokale Wirtschaft vernichtet, Bürgerkriege ausgelöst und ein massives Bevölkerungswachstum verursacht, das der Kontinent nicht dauerhaft ohne komplette Vernichtung der dortigen Umwelt ernähren kann. 

Genau die Ansicht vertrete ich auch.

Früher gab es in Afrika, bedingt durch Hunger und Krankheit, eine extrem hohe Kindersterblichkeit. Daher sah man es als erforderlich an möglichst viele Kinder zu zeugen, da man nicht ohne Nachkommen dastehen wollte.

Dank westlicher Medizin hat sich die Kindersterblichkeit in Schwarzafrika von 179/1000 im Jahr 1990 auf 92/1000 reduziert, ältere Aufzeichnungen konnte ich leider nicht finden. Allerdings behält man das alte Muster bei und hat daher ein extremes Bevölkerungswachstum.

Da Bilder von kranken und hungernden Kindern im Westen gut ankommen, werden immer größere Summen für humanitäre Hilfe gespendet. Dass lokale Betriebe nicht mit derartig subventionierten Gütern konkurieren können und daher pleite gehen interessiert dabei kaum jemanden. Bedingt durch das Wegbrechen der Arbeitsplätze und die dadurch leidene Wirtschaft gibt es noch mehr Armut, was widerum zu noch mehr Hunger und Krankheit führt. Ein Teufelskreis.

Vor 1950 hat die Natur die Population geregelt, dann kamen die NGO's und mit ihnen Hilfsgüter, die zwar kurzeitige Lingerung bringen, aber langfristig zu einer Bevölkerungsexplosion und damit Abhängigkeit von besagten ausländischen Hilfen, Verelendung und einen Kampf um Land und Ressourcen führen.

What ever you are discussing is not corporate tax. 100% corporate tax couldn't ever exist. Use correct terms.

People vote no since they didn't want to increase taxes and cut social spending. What else would they be expected to vote? Also Syriza told them to vote no.

&gt;If you know the truth and still think that austerity is the way to go you’re at least a cold hearted person. 

Nice. Think about it this way: Effectively you are moving austerity from your country to ours.

Every euro loaned to Greece and not paid back to Finland will come out of the Finnish tax payers, Finland is in recession and austerity is implemented here.

&gt; 

Not really. The marxist belief was in one **specific** type of society and an ideological framework. A united Europe and global society will inevitably happen, but what exactly it is and how it looks like remains to be determined. In truth, any number of ideologies may prevail in the end. My own personal ideology, of course, aligns most closely with principles of liberal democracies.

Point being, the belief that a global society will happen does not have an ideological context of any sort. It is merely an observation that the 19th century arrangements have become obsolete in a globalized world, and it is simple social inertia that strives to replace them. It isn't me or like-minded individuals that are *fighting* for a global society, we're only trying to make the best of it and make sure Europe isn't lagging behind the rest of the world.

&gt; It does not lead to good democratic outcomes, which will be its death.

That's a non-statement. ""A good democratic outcome"" is not a quantifiable thing. A point can easily be made, especially in lieu of recent UK elections, that the nation state arrangement does not lead to a good democratic outcome either. Or that no society ever did.

I will make a different point, however. If liberal democracy fails to adapt properly to a globalized world, that will mean the death of liberal democracy, NOT the death of globalization.

While globalisation might be inevitable, global governance is not inevitable.

&gt; That's a non-statement. ""A good democratic outcome"" is not a quantifiable thing. A point can easily be made, especially in lieu of recent UK elections, that the nation state arrangement does not lead to a good democratic outcome either. Or that no society ever did.

I think the UK got a great outcome. I'm pleased with it. Democracy requires a demos. Europe does not have that.

&gt; I will make a different point, however. If liberal democracy fails to adapt properly to a globalized world, that will mean the death of liberal democracy, NOT the death of globalization. I do not believe that to be true, however. It is very much possible to maintain democracy in a large state-like entity.

And why doesn't the neo-colonial EU punish Germany for its illegal long-running surplus that because of the size of the Germany economy, the EU's largest, it causes much more systematic problems(Europhiles brag and gloat that Greece represents something like 2% of EU GDP. Well then Europhiles how could Greece be the most responsible then?):

&gt;This is the fifth consecutive year that Germany’s surplus has been above 6pc of GDP. The EU’s Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure states that the Commission should launch infringement proceedings if this occurs for three years in a row, unless there is a clear reason not to.

Germany committed heinous war crimes and genocide and it only had to pay 3% of its exports as reparations in surplus years!

&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/27/greece-spain-helped-germany-recover   
&gt;Perhaps the most innovative feature of the London agreement was a clause that said West Germany should only pay for debts out of its trade surplus, and any repayments were limited to 3% of exports earnings every year. This meant those countries that were owed debt had to buy West German exports in order to be paid. It meant West Germany would only pay from genuine earnings, without recourse to new loans. And it meant Germany's creditors had an interest in the country growing and its economy thriving. 

What genocide, war crimes, pan-European looting, brutal military occupation and forced slave labor is Greece being punished far worse for? The position of crazy Europhiles is revolting.

null,false,MobileRedditSucksAss,IREL,Ireland,null,"I mean in Fairness, the centers in Ireland are catering to Europe not just Ireland. Is it unreasonable for them to want multi-lingustic employees in a union of countries that don't all speak the same language? How many Irish Nationals does you think are qualified for the Job at Facebook and also speak Swiss/Dutch/Norweigian/Polish/Danish. I would wager that very few would because we already have a very common language in English which most of biggest trade partners speak (Britain, America and most German people speak English) theres very little incentive for Irish Nationals to learn foreign languages of the EU outside French and German(Which are pushed in schools).

Having a single Hub simplifies the organisation and legal red tape of a company - which is another reason those jobs are posted in Ireland - And those EU nationals who meet those requirements are more than welcome to come, work here and share in Irelands tech industry.

Yes, the tax helps the situation, but it is not the *sole* reason for investment in Ireland by these Multinationals. The reason you dont see job postings for Swedish speakers with degrees in American bases of these companies because A: the supply of Swedish people is low and so is the demand. Whereas a European hub requires people who speak every language.

The Employees are not kept on constant call, they are given their work schedules ahead of time (Often times weeks in advance) with only occasional emergency call ins when someone is sick or a problem occurs. Temporary labour used to fill this void but with Temporary labour there is often a disconnect between the temp and the workplace, the quality of the work they do and every time they are brought in there is some time to be spent on educating, training and making sure they have their certifications and insurance to work on the construction site. By using Contractors we can build good long term working relations with the contracted employee, cut down on costs associated with sourcing and training good workers by simple being able to be flexible to the ebb and flow of the market demand. The employees are not at our beck and call, these arrangements often give them financial  freedom, the van driver I contract for example to deliver our goods to building sites negotiated a pay increase for himself today (100-400 more euro a week depending on how busy we are and whether he has a helper, bringing him to 900-1300 a week depending a pretty good salary if you ask me even when you keep in mind toll costs, Diesel, the fact he owns and maintains his own van and insurance) Additionally the experience with the management of their own affairs can often land them in better jobs, I've lost some contractors to this who got hired as managers of competing firms due to the fact they had experience in running themselves as a business and the administration that comes with it aswell as some employees who have refused those jobs because they enjoy the freedom that comes with the contract.

Anything can be good or bad, it depends on how its used. I like to think we've created a company culture that shares the benefits of the labour with all our employees which worked to our advantage during the collapse of the construction sector when many of the employees voluntarily took pay cuts to help keep the business afloat because they knew we weren't trying to fuck them out of money.

I cant speak for other employers, but I feel at my firm we are doing our best to embody the spirit of what the contracts are supposed to be employed. I'm sure there are unscrupulous employers out there who squeeze thenfuck out of their contractors but construction is a small industry here. I know a lot of people who refuse to work with our competitors due to late payments and fucking them around to no end.

The two go hand-in-hand. Market alone does not tolerate superficial barriers imposed as a consequence of ""national"" interests. As the economy goes global, need arises for countries to synchronize their legislation to accommodate free trade. Trade deal after trade deal, there's always another barrier to be broken, and then another, and then another, until one day you have the equivalent of a continental/global governance, with only strictly local issues being devolved.

Isn't it better to go into this process aware of what it really is, than to go through the motions, falsely believing that you can stop any time you want? The latter only makes it more difficult to get what you want in the end.

As the second bailout program expired last tuesday also those mechanisms expired. Yet those mechanisms still have some previously accumulated funds which would have been given to Greece if the program had continued.

It's not. Look at the stats. Greeks didn't have an average pension age much lower than the rest of Europe and now have a higher age than Germany. Greeks worked more hours than most other Europeans, their economy was just less productive. So let's restate a bit:

There's a guy who gets up at 6, Iraklis, and looks for work, who has trouble affording food or his apartment, who unluckily has been unemployed for a year and can't afford to go to hospital for the cancer that is eating through his lungs, next to the gal who works for 12 hours a day (her name is Adoni) and had her salary cut by 50% because she's a public employee, who doesn't believe there'll be a pension for her, and next to *them* there's this guy (Angelus) who is gentrifying the area the Iraklis and Adoni live in, living large in a nice house and land is cheap now, demanding that his two neighbours pay back the credit he gave them so they could pay off his cousin (Johannes) who had given them a speculative credit so that they could keep their house.

And now the guy working the third guys garden (Piotr) is totally angry with Iraklis and Adoni because Angelus tells him that the Iraklis is deliberately just lying around at home and no that isn't a noose he's making, and Adoni is gone the whole day, obviously being lazy on some beach somewhere. And look at the state of their gardens!

&gt; À ce stade, soit la BCE reconnait que la Grèce a le droit de faire ça tout en restant dans l'euro (ce qui serait une possibilité! Seule la doxa actuelle l'empêche) 
&gt; soit elle décide de chasser la Grèce de l'euro, ce qui est probablement le plus logique au vu de l'état d'esprit ambiant.

Chasser la Grèce de l'euro est une décision politique que la BCE ne fera pas.  Elle ne coupe déjà pas les ELA alors que c'est obligatoire d'après ses statuts.

L'EuroGroupe, peut-être; mais j'ai jamais rien entendu d'autre que ""sans accord, la situation va devenir intenable pour la Grèce et Grèce va sortir en pratique toute seule de l'Euro"". 

&gt; Une sortie de l'euro ne «permet» pas de sortir de l'austérité. C'est la sortie de l'austérité qui causera surement une sortie de l'euro.

&gt; Et actuellement le budget de l'état grec est, hors couts de la dette, à l'équilibre.
&gt; S'ils suspendent les paiements de la dette pour quelques années ils auront 1% du PIB de bénefs directement injectables dans une politique de relance.

Je ne vois pas ta marge de manœuvre.  Le budget était à l'équilibre avant l'arrivée de Syriza au pouvoir.  Il y a suffisamment de personnes pour dire que Syriza a relâché l'effort et qu'il ne l'est plus rien qu'à cause de ça pour ne pas envisager cette possibilité. Et il ne l'est à coup sûr plus maintenant.  La semaine passée avec le contrôle des capitaux a fait des dégâts aux entreprises et au tourisme.  Bon les gens se précipitent pour payer par virement tout ce qu'ils peuvent parce qu'ils n'ont pas du tout confiance dans leurs banques (avec raison, avec le oui je doutais déjà qu'il n'y ait pas de prélèvement, avec le non, je doute encore plus; en payant ses dettes, c'est celui qui reçoit l'argent qui a la risque pour sa pomme), ça va donner peut-être un peu d'air mais sans accord, la Grèce va ressortir à des reconnaissances de dettes pour payer les fonctionnaires et les retraites avant fin septembre (et je suis optimiste, certains ne voient pas le prochain paiement se faire autrement).  

Pour revenir aux banques.  Sans accord réouvrir les banques en euro, c'est leur faillite. Même sans les ouvrir, sans accord la BCE ne peut pas statutairement continuer très longtemps à reconduire les ELA -- dés le défaut au FMI, la règle aurait été d'arrêter les ELA; il suffira d'un moins patient que les autres pour conduire l'affaire devant les tribunaux pour la forcer à saisir les garanties qui ont été offerte en échange des ELA -- et alors c'est la faillite.  Sans accord elles ne rouvriront probablement que nationalisée et avec les dépôts rabotés, et peut-être converti dans une autre monnaie que l'euro. 

La Grèce peut tenter l'aventure d'un système à deux monnaies.  A taux fixe -- bonjour le marché noir -- ou à taux libre -- bonjour la dévaluation.

De toute manière, le contrôle des transferts vers l'étranger va continuer.  Avec tous les problèmes que ça pose.  Les candidats à livrer en Grèce sans garantie sérieuse -- externe à la Grèce -- d'être payé à l'avance en devise vont pas être nombreux avant un certain temps.

&gt; Plus réalistiquement, la Grèce continuera à négocier un allègement partiel de sa dette et un allègement partiel des politiques d'austérité. Mais Syriza a probablement ses estimations sur un cout de la sortie de l'euro et sur le cout des politiques d'austérités. S'ils trouvent qu'ils ont trop à perdre de rester gentils face à la troïka, ils peuvent simplement claquer la porte.

Je ne vois pas un accord faisant des réductions de la dette autre que conditionnel passer devant les 18 parlements de la zone Euro. (Et il y a pas mal d'analystes qui ne voient pas passer un accord qui envisage la possibilité d'une réduction -- il y a certainement un consensus que c'est économiquement nécessaire, mais le consensus politique que c'est opportun d'en faire mention n'est vraiment pas là; il y a aussi un certain consensus que ce n'est pas économiquement un problème pour le moment).

As a Dutchman... Sorry for all you have to go through. 

There have been a lot of mistakes made in Greece. A country that shouldn't have been allowed in the Euro zone in the first place but cheated its way in with false statistics is now paying the price... A capital bubble, a lot of mismanagement and chaos followed, and now you're in the shit.

As a country you've made mistakes, big mistakes. It just sucks that those mistakes were so complex and hidden that the average voter just cannot be expected to understand all of it.

I'm torn. Torn between a feeling that your country gets what it deserves but in the meantime I see the average person on the street who's just trying to live his life and has no grasp of macro-economics suffering...

Virtually all dialects of English have a replacement for the plural you, e.g. Y'all, you all, you guys, yinz, you lads, you lot, youse, ye, yahs, etc.It was only really dropped in formal situations. 

Also, dropping 'thou' in part reflected the growing political status of commoners. It at least correlates quite strongly with a dramatic change in British society away from the monarchy towards stronger democracy in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

[You can also ask the Swedes how they feel about losing their formal pronouns.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du-reformen). They weren't officially dropped until the 1970s. And last I checked, Swedish society hadn't collapsed. Like in English, there is definitely a correlation between changes in Swedish society towards greater egalitarianism and a blurring of formal/informal pronouns. 

EDIT: 

I also noticed from my time in Berlin that young people actively avoided using 'Sie' with each other even in work situations, I would bet that German will drop the formal pronoun 'Sie' in the relatively near future.

**IMF has betrayed its mission in Greece, captive to EMU creditors**

&gt; Yet leaked minutes from the IMF board meetings showed that all the emerging market members (and Switzerland) opposed the terms of the first loan package for Greece. They protested that it was intended to save the euro, not Greece.

&gt; It loaded yet more debt onto the crushed shoulders of an already bankrupt country, and further complicated the picture by allowing one large French bank and one German bank – no names please – to offload much of their €25bn combined exposure onto EMU taxpayers.

&gt; “Debt restructuring should have been on the table,” said Brazil's member. The loans “may be seen not as a rescue of Greece, which will have to undergo a wrenching adjustment, but as a bailout of Greece’s private debt holders, mainly European financial institutions”.

&gt; Arvind Virmani, India’s member, was prophetic. ""The scale of the fiscal reduction without any monetary policy offset is unprecedented. It is a mammoth burden that the economy could hardly bear,” he said.

&gt;___Du-reformen___ (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈdʉː reˈfɔrmən], *the you-reform*) was the process of popularization of the [second-person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person) [singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_number) [pronoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun) *du* as a universal form of address in [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden), in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The use of *[du](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/du#Swedish)* ([cognate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate) with English *[thou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou)*, French *tu*, and German *du*) replaced an intricate former system where speakers could use the third person *hon* and *han* (""she"" and ""he'), the second person [plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural) pronoun *ni* (""you"") or titles like *fru* and *fröken* (""[Mrs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs.)"" and ""[Ms.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms.)""), *kamrer* (""accountant""), *doktor* (""doctor""), etc.

Yeah the referendum was clearly a decision of the average Greek citizen.

Now you fucking speak about the 'old political system', as if Syriza and the fascists of ANEL and the neonazis of Golden Dawn aren't the deepest and sickest part of the old political system, a magnification of its most vile portion, rather than something new, 

Well, you just contradicted yourself. On one hand you blame the NO people for the Germanotsolias rhetoric, on the other you do the same thing with the ""Damn commies"" ""Nenonazis"" rhetoric. Irony much?



There is but one truth: If the YES had won, then the current government would have to resign. Which means moving on to a provisional government. One consisting of ND, PASOK, POTAMI, mainly.

If I apply this to here, there are three threads I would have deleted today:

This kind of caricature does not contribute anything of value, it belittles Greece as a nation and pours oil on the fire of stereotypes (in varying degrees). In a situation like we have, they are not harmless fun, they are bullying.

I won't get into the ""but, but, but CENSORSHIP"" debate, because considering what I have seen on that imageboard, you can choose between either the forum going to hell or weeding out the worst.

Here, it will be a lot of bitching about the moderators.

Everyone with half a brain knows that saving money instead of spending or investing it can't create growth. And if people do honestly reject that notion, then shame on them.

But if your credit rating is literally 'trash' and no one is willing to lend you any more money and the system you put in place is the fiscal equivalent of a black hole then you aren't going to get investment. Based on your track record, investors aren't going to trust you, and neither are lenders, to create meaningful growth instead of fake growth based on runaway borrowing.

All these economists circlejerking about how austerity doesn't create growth are talking about a theoretical situation similar to how physicists use ideal, Newtonian systems without friction or entropy when they make quick calculations. That's not an accurate representation of what Greece's economy is like, and it's not an accurate representation of its credit rating and standing in the face of the IMF and EZ at large.  
All the titles and prizes in the world don't mean anything if people miss the point entirely.

For the bazillionth time, yes, more investment in the EU is needed.  
Yes, austerity is very poor at creating growth. No, growth is not the goal of austerity. Austerity is the kind of thing you put in place when the established system and politicians can no longer be trusted to handle money, when investors have lost confidence (even more so when your credit rating is literally 'trash'). Austerity is an emergency brake and the only thing that guarantees that countries live within their means.

Greece needs reforms on every level.  Tax collection, private sector reform, public sector reduction.

&gt;[...]

&gt;**The real difference is sovereignty.**

&gt;- The Eurozone is a voluntary ‘union’ of states which remain sovereign and can at any time secede, break any rule or previous commitment.

&gt;- By contrast, in the US, secession is excluded, and federal decisions can in the last resort always be enforced by the federal administrative and judicial system. This is the key difference between the ‘dollar area’ and the Eurozone.

&gt;If Greece were part of the US, it could not hold a referendum, and its budget would now be drawn up by a federal bankruptcy court. Even the most ambitious ‘political union’ one can imagine for Europe would not change this.

&gt;The absence of a system of fiscal transfers for the Eurozone is much less important. The very large transfers received through the US federal fiscal system have anyway not prevented long-term economic underperformance and an acute fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico. There is no reason to believe that this would be different in Europe.

&gt;The employment rates (and the fall in employment over the last years) are almost identical. Puerto Rico would have Greek style unemployment rates if emigration had not provided a safety valve.

&gt;In terms of the poverty rate, Puerto Rico does much worse than Greece (at over 45% versus 35.7% for Greece). This is surprising given the large transfers that flow to inhabitants of Puerto Rico in various forms of social security payments.

&gt;More surprising are perhaps the similarities in the terms of fiscal problems. Public debt is, of course, much lower as a percentage of ‘national’ income. But the more appropriate comparison would be the debt burden relative to public revenues. On this account, Puerto Rico appears even more over-indebted than Greece. Its public debt is higher relative to government revenues (4.5 times) than that of Greece (‘only’ 3.87 times revenues), and its government devotes a higher share of revenues to interest payments (13%) than Greece’s government does at present (‘only’ 8.5%).

&gt;Puerto Rico thus appears even more over-indebted than Greece on both accounts.

A) Being proud of your national identity is limiting yourself to the boundaries of your own nation, and in most cases, your own ethnicity. It's isolationism. This is not something to be proud of in the 21st century.

2) Most of the time your national identity is specifically constructed based on painful history. In many cases it's an identity that takes pride in harm caused to your neighbour. 

3) The notion of national identity is skewed. For each person,depending on his region and political views the way he views his nation will differ. The question is : What is national identity ? Everyone will have a different answer to that.

4) You have nothing to be proud of. Being proud of being born in a region, and associating your whole personal identity with a idea of a nation that is like you is in itself delusional. You can enjoy and be proud of the positive aspects of the history of your country. You can consider your country a nice place to live with good values, and good living standards. But associating such things with an identity makes no sense.  

At the end of it, breaking down national identities doesn't refer to destroying the cultural aspects of each region or country in Europe. It simply refers to opening people's eyes in seeing that the people across the border are very similar to the ones that are inside your own border. You both share a lot of things, and you have a lot in common. It's about learning about one another. 

Being proud goes against the idea of being open to any change or anything different. You're also mistaken nationalism for what some may call patriotism. Whereas a nationalist is proud of the national identity, a patriot will be open to any changes that will make his country improve. He will not take pride in his country or national identity, but he will continuously criticise it. He will be disposed to change the bad things and improve on the good things (this goes completely against the notion of identity, which by definition is static and not disposed to change).  He will openly learn from other countries and look with open eyes to their culture and traditions, the way they do things, and he will teach other about his/their country and culture, the good and the bad things just as much.

1) Almeno a Bologna, a livello burocratico, si può: non sei tenuto a frequentare nessuna lezione, solitamente (ma non sempre) il programma che dovrai portare all'esame è poco più consistente rispetto ai frequentanti (ma alcune volte persino inferiore). Sono in molti a non frequentare e dare gli esami quando riescono (per motivi di lavoro o varie), perché è un corso che si può completare tranquillamente utilizzando tutto il tempo necessario.

2) Come hanno già detto in molti, l'interesse, la curiosità, l'apertura mentale per seguire corsi che non ti serviranno mai in ""concreto"" nella tua vita, ma che possono aprirti la porta per interessi ""superiori"". Imparare tutto a memoria non ti servirà a niente (ma comunque se lo fai per interesse non sarebbe il tuo caso), è più importante capire le cose e saperle legare tra di loro che ricordarsi ogni minima data e nome.

3) Tutto sommato si, alcuni esami mi hanno deluso (più che altro per i professori e le loro modalità di insegnamento), ma tutti mi hanno arricchito e (visto il mio indirizzo di storia contemporanea) il potermi inserire in qualsiasi discorso di attualità senza difficoltà mi mostra come l'università mi stia preparando comunque per il mondo al di fuori di essa.

4) Per accrescere la tua conoscenza del mondo e del suo funzionamento si, a livello lavorativo non credo che ti darà niente di più a meno che tu non voglia proprio entrare nel settore ma a livello culturale/qualitativo ti apre un mondo.

This, essentially is a fundamental problem of the EUR monetary union and many people (including Friedman, Krugman, Varoufakis and many more I suspect) have criticized the EZ for that reason. In the long run, this monetary union hurts everyone.

Liberal democracies 'have a hat' in protecting other liberal democracies.

On the economic front things aren't quite cut and dry. We've seen marked improvement since 2012, instituting the Single-Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), and single rule-book for all financial parties.

But the risk of contagion still exists. Meanwhile several economic institutes have questioned the use of risk-weighted assets, stating,

--

&gt; Over the past five years, a solid body of empirical work has shown that bank capital ratios employing unweighted total assets in the denominator – so-called leverage ratios – are far more effective in distinguishing sick from healthy banks than risk-based measures that use risk-weighted assets in the denominator.4 The 2014 test (like its three predecessors) used only a risk-based measure of bank capital. This is not technical hair-splitting but rather an issue that cuts to the very heart of the credibility of stress tests.

Meanwhile we still have yet to institute the Single-Deposit Guarantee Mechanism; a tool designed to strengthen the back of European banking while protecting the financial security of EU citizens.

**Recap**

--

* Risk of contagion still present.
* Single-Deposit Guarantee Mechanism (long seen as the vital 'third leg' of the Banking Union) not implemented.
* Unsure credibility of ECB's rule-book and oversight mechanism

How many Irish Nationals does you think are qualified for the Job at Facebook and also speak Swiss/Dutch/Norweigian/Polish/Danish. I would wager that very few would because we already have a very common language in English which most of biggest trade partners speak (Britain, America and most German people speak English) theres very little incentive for Irish Nationals to learn foreign languages of the EU outside French and German(Which are pushed in schools).

There is not and I wouldn't expect Irish to learn those languages either, I would however expect facebook to quit being stingy on costs and setup an office in each relevant state and pay their taxes to that state on the business they do in their country.  

Yes the idea of a european hub is just that but when most the jobs there are literally related to clients in they emigrated from it's kinda obvious it's for tax reasons.

I've read it again. The best evidence for your viewpoint is here: ""However, very significant changes in policies and in the outlook since early this year have resulted in a substantial increase in financing needs"" (p. 3). That's the only reference I could find concerning ""Syriza"" did this. But then the text does not really support this claim. 

Let's have a look at the list again, shall we? 

* lower fiscal targets: That already didn't work in 2014, before Syriza. Already then they were not met. I don't know exactly about the lower target in 2015, I assume it's due to a lower overall budget. You can't exactly produce a surplus from nothing.
* lower privatization proceeds: Also not a new story. A quote from the May 2014 report (published in June 2014): ""Performance on privatization continues to fall short of expectations. Receipts for 2013 were just over €1 billion, short of the €1.6 billion indicative target (the target had been lowered in the fourth review)"" (p. 17). 
* lower economic growth: Whatever Syriza did or didn't do, it could not possibly have that much of an effect within five months. Further, the Greek GDP seems to have been on the decline already again, with our without Syriza (http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp-growth-annual).
* clearing arrears: I don't think you can seriously blaim Syriza for the unpaid bills the Samaras administration forgot about.
* Rebuilding buffers and paying down short-term borrowing: The only aspect where I see your point. Both deplenishment of buffers and short-term borrowing are mechanisms Syriza used to meet payment dates.

Concerning the growth: Again, the May 2014 review was a best-case review. Usually, you don't meet your best case, usually you meet an average case. To achieve this over a span of 30 years means you'll have to be far above it some years, in the range of 4-5%.

Prenons un ouvrier et un professeur qui gagnent respectivement, 1000€ pour le premier et 2000€ pour le second.  
  
Comme tu l'as dit, si on choisit la première option, c'est à dire, si l'ouvrier ne peut pas toucher le revenu de base parce qu'il a un travail, alors il va logiquement arrêter de travailler puisqu'il touche la même chose sans travailler qu'en travaillant. Le seul moyen de le faire retourner au travail, c'est d'augmenter le salaire de l'ouvrier, mais puisque le salaire de l'ouvrier a augmenté, le professeur va en toute logique lui aussi demander à ce que son salaire soit augmenté. À partir de là, on entre dans une spirale inflationniste avec les enchaînements et les effets que l'on connaît.
  
Si on choisit à présent, la deuxième option, c'est à dire, un revenu de base qui s'ajoute au revenu déjà perçu. Dans ce cas, l'ouvrier va gagner 2000€ et le professeur 3000€. Mais le principal problème, c'est qu'il va falloir désormais verser 1000€ de revenus supplémentaires à un professeur qui jusque là ne touchait rien de la part de l'Etat. Or comment financer tous ces nouveaux revenus supplémentaires si ce n'est en accroissant la pression fiscale ? L'enchaînement sera après le suivant : les entreprises face à ces augmentations d'impôts seront obligées d'augmenter leur prix pour conserver leurs marges et on obtient en bout de course de l'inflation. Parce que je veux bien croire que si on transformait toutes les aides pour les plus pauvres en un seul et unique revenu universel, à la limite il y a moyen de faire des économies importantes dans les coûts de gestion administrative, mais s'il faut distribuer des dizaines de revenus à des gens ne touchaient rien de la part de l'Etat, là ce n'est plus tenable.  
  
Bref, de loin, ça ressemble juste à une machine à inflation. Et encore, il faudrait également aborder tous les problèmes que ça pose dans un contexte européen et mondial. Après, je connais mal voire pas du tout le sujet, il est probable que certaines choses m'échappent.

At this point if Greece is not to default another bailout would very probably or rather certainly be necessary. The sad thing is that I believe it would not, or not in that dimension, have been necessary had syriza not come to power in the last election.

There has been enough talk about politics and its consequences to Greeces balance at this point so lets omit both politic and social issues for economy, or rather foreign investment. 

For an economy which is in shambles with an government unable to pump vast amounts of money there is no greater boon than foreign investment. Specifically private foreign investment as the sums in private economy can often be many times higher than those a government could muster.

However private foreign investment has one clear hurdle. It obviously would need to have the prospect to be profitable. To ensure this companies make very specific risk calculations to ensure themselves they'll at least get their money back and thus will only invest when the risk is low compared to the possible profit.   
I've actually spoken extensively with some heads of German companies both pre and after the election which lead to Syrizas rise to power. To boil it down to their opinions Greece was a hard sell pre election largely due to inefficient ^((and corrupt, but is not necessarily bad for companies...^^psst...)) bureaucracy and to a part uncertainity on on the conditions which would be faced a few years later. Now it is absolutely impossible to justify doing anything, partly even going so far as to decline trades with prior payment as even they have a substantial risk involved. 

This is due to the absolute uncertainity on what will happen under Syrizas rule. with it comes the unability to calculate risks and profits which makes even interested firms unable to invest in Greece. So completely disregarding whether or not Syriza has goals and ideas which are or are not good they largely managed to destroy Greeces possibilities to get back on its feet.",null,0,null,1436301765,null,0,false,0,csvepde,null,t3_3cepxr,null,t1_csvepde,null,t1_csv6kam,null,null,null,1437666737,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

&gt; Witchhunt downvotes usually don't have any impact beyond making your posts seem slightly more controversial than they really are. You may see the downvote count go up, but it doesn't change your karma or your score. If you feel we're not discounting these downvotes well enough, you can always message the admins and we'll take care of any problematic users.

&gt; EDIT: One thing you should **NEVER** do is use alternate accounts to upvote yourself. That's a quick way to get banned.

I actually held back a little...I support petitions, they're a viable and important democratic tool - but what we see here is abusing such a tool in a way, that it comes as close to rigging a vote you can get without actually rigging the vote. I have much harsher words for that than those I've used.

&gt; When there is at least one new thread in this subforum every day about how to come to germany as a student/whatever with the most basic questions, then surely such a petition from time to time is more of a welcome distraction rather than a nuisance...

I don't exactly see the connection, but yes, the same thing every day is boring and those people are mostly lazy...

I have no problems with petitions (like I mentioned before) - just with this one and the way it is being used. Local issues need to be addressed locally, by the people affected by it - not by internet goons eating up the ""stick it to the man"" rhetoric and only being (barely) presented one side of the story.

The only reasonable explanation I see is that game theorists Varoufakis predicted that there's no way for a grexit, simply because there's no law which would permit it. By saying NO, they would essentially get a better deal, simply because that's the only chance. Is it?

On the other hand, it seems a lot of politicians really do want to keep greece in EZ. But after all this, is there a way? Which would not create a landslide of requests from PIIGS?

How about 10-15 years of living as large as the Germans while producing maybe 30% of what Germany does. The Greek debt is not something that came into being, puff, in 2010.

Es ist doch aber seit Euro-Einführung genau umgekehrt gelaufen:

Das griechische Problem ist wohl eher der viel zu hohe Konsum in der Vergangenheit und der Gegenwart, der über Schulden finanziert wurde.
Letzten Endes kann man das Problem nämlich genau darauf herunter brechen, dass Griechenland über seine Verhältnisse gelebt hat, ob nun über im Verhältnis zum BIP hohe Renten und Beamtengehälter oder aufgrund mangelnder Steuererhebung oder beides sei einmal dahingestellt. 

Dies übrigens unabhängig von den Schulden! Wie z.B. aus dieser Statistik* zu entnehmen hatte Griechenland 2013 ein Primärdefizit von über -8% des BIPs, d.h. vor Berücksichtigung etwaiger Zinsen! 
Insofern sind weder irgendwelche bösen Banken/ Spekulanten noch die ach so bösen Deutschen daran Schuld, dass die Griechen Bankrott sind. Ohne die Gläubiger wäre die Situation nur schon viele Jahre zuvor eingetreten.

Most of the revenue they obtained to spend more comes from exports to china. Which was riding high in the 2002-2012 economic boom to china.

And slowing down when exports because of a slowing brazil and china reducing economic demand.

I didn't know basic macroeconomics were far-left. I guess it goes along with the saying ""Reality has a liberal bias."" 
Recessions are solved through stimulus. What did the EZ impose? The inverse of stimulus. Austerity was necessary, yes -- a slow austerity supplied along with investment, not huge cuts that drive the economy further down.

I also don't see how slower cuts would lead to worse austerity, it works in the exactly opposite way. Greece was the most responsive to reform, out of all European bailed-out countries. The result? Something that everyone across the world predicted all along: further recession and a subsequent rise in debt to GDP ratio despite any budget balancing. 

Isn't it funny how the country most responsive to the reforms required by the Troika is the one in the worst state now?

The rest does not interest me. We are talking about mismanagement and a solution to the crisis.

you do need insurance for that. just go to any insurance company and tell them you need a ""versicherungskarte"" for the short term licence plates. with that you'll be insured for the 5 days those are valid. if you do register the car with the same company, the insurance for those 5 days will be free (most of the time), otherwise they will mail you the invoice later.

registering a car in germany is a time consuming process with lots of bureaucracy involved, so if the dealership offers to do it, let them.

usually it goes like this: you go to the dealership(s) and find a car you like. you make an appointment for a test drive (often they have to get them ready. wash them, connect and recharge batteries, stuff like that). depending on how much you trust the dealer and how technically adapt you are, you can take the car to TÜV or DEKRA or similar to get it checked (also make an appointment) or check it yourself for technical faults (some dealers will let you use their car lifts for that).  
If you like the car and you've agreed on a price (and maybe haggled with them for some extra stuff like new set of tires or doing minor repairs first), you go to your insurance and deal with all the formalities there and you'll get an insurance number to use for the car registration. if you want personalized licence plates this is also the time to reserve them (can be done online). then either you or the dealer will do the registering with all the documents needed and after that you pick it up and pay the money.  
if the dealer is in a different area and you don't have all the documents for the permanent registration, you have to get the temporary plates first, pick up the car (and its documents) and then register it yourself.

one more thing: i'd always insist on the dealer getting a new TÜV and AU and be cautious about the fan belt (""Keilriemen"") most cars should have theirs changed at ~100000 km (some 80k or 60k), and doing so is a bit more costly, so a lot of people rather sell their car before doing it.",null,0,null,1436302546,null,0,1436304594,0,csvf98i,null,t3_3cfddc,null,t1_csvf98i,null,t1_csv9e6n,null,null,null,1437667199,null,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2,null

But that's not true because having to pay back foreign debt  in a state of crisis would almost surely lead to devaluing of one's currency and therefore further inflate the outstanding debt. That's the opposite of what's happening in Greece: Debt got swapped and trades far below market rates which is why growing out of debt is certainly possible within the EZ (as Latvia shows) as opposed to countries with weak currencies.

Nonetheless, I am actually in favor of debt restructuring in Greece once sustainable long-term reforms aimed at productivity growth have been put in place.

You really think it's bad to privatize e.g. [Railways of Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railways_of_Greece#Financial_problems)

&gt;Hellenic Railways operates at a loss of about $3.8 million per day, having accumulated a total debt of 13 billion $, or about 5% of Greek GDP (2010). The bulk of this debt will mature in 2014. In 2008, the company reported a loss of more than $ 1 billion, on sales of about $ 253 million. 

&gt;Between 2000 and 2009, the cost of the company’s payroll soared by 50 percent even as overall personnel decreased by 30 percent. The average salary of a rail employee is over $78,000. In the mountainous Peloponnese region, trains manned by drivers being paid as much as $130,000 a year frequently run empty.

&gt;For the better part of a decade, Greece has provided sovereign backing to Hellenic Railways, thus allowing it to borrow billions even though the company’s finances are so skewed that it pays three times as much on interest expenses than it collects in revenue. 

&gt;As the debt of state-owned enterprises was not counted toward Greece’s official debt, Greece has been able to use the rail system as a means to support employment while not adding to its official debt number; basically an accounting trick to hide debt. The Greek government is aware that only the closure of a substantial number of loss-making routes and large employment cuts (between 2500-3500 of the 7000 staff) will make Hellenic Railways attractive to foreign investors. 

&gt;But the Railway Union opposes privatization and threatens with strikes if jobs and benefits are threatened.[9] Nevertheless, some lines have been closed since 2010 (see below).",null,0,null,1436302875,null,0,false,0,csvfhkj,null,t3_3ceu9d,null,t1_csvfhkj,null,t1_csv2u41,null,null,null,1437667388,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Belgium's infrastructure is among the best in Europe and the world according to the World Bank. It's just not well maintained. Flanders is working on it so your criticism is kinda irrelevant now.  Furthermore, have you ever been to Canada? 

Traffic is unsafe due to the planning or better said, the lack of it in the past. Cannot fix that now as that would require thousands, if not millions of people to relocate.  

&gt; many strikes

Denmark and France for example strike more. 

&gt; massive bureaucracy and politics being about the conflicts between the language zones all the time.

Belgium is a horse that's a hundred times tougher to handle than the Netherlands. Massive bureaucracy is there for a reason. Belgium is as efficient and effective as it can be currently. 

&gt; In some ways Belgium could be described as the Greece of Western Europe.

&gt;It was a triple plan. They would ""requisition"" the Bank of Greece and sack the governor under emergency national laws. The estimated €17bn of reserves still stashed away in various branches of the central bank would be seized.

&gt;They would issue parallel liquidity and California-style IOUs denominated in euros to keep the banking system afloat, backed by an appeal to the European Court of Justice to throw the other side off balance, all the while asserting Greece's full legal rights as a member of the eurozone. If the creditors forced Grexit, they - not Greece - would be acting illegally, with implications for tort contracts in London, New York and even Frankfurt.

&gt;They would impose a haircut on €27bn of Greek bonds held by the ECB, and deemed ""odious debt"" by some since the original purchases were undertaken by the ECB to save French and German banks, forestalling a market debt restructuring that would otherwise have happened.

&gt;""They were trying to strangle us into submission, and this is how we would retaliate,"" said one cabinet minister. Mr Tsipras rejected the plan. It was too dangerous. But a week later, that is exactly what he may have to do, unless he prefers to accept a forced return to the drachma.

Greek banks have all but run dry as the last drops of liquidity provided by the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) are being consumed. Greece urgently needs an injection of cash or else the banking sector will simply collapse within days. By its own rules the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which manages the ELA cannot release another tranche of funds unless Greece can credibly repay the funds in the future. Needless to say, such a situation will be contingent on the meeting on Sunday going well, which would open up the desperately needed temporary liquidity injection and would pave the way for the finalization of the third bailout. If the meeting fails, Sunday may very well mark the end of any hope of Greece remaining in the Euro.

&gt; It's not easy to get agreement on actual fraud levels in government programs. Unsurprisingly, liberals say they're low, while conservatives insist they're astronomically high. In truth, it varies from program to program. One government report says fraud accounts for less than 2 percent of unemployment insurance payments. It's seemingly impossible to find statistics on ""welfare"" (i.e., TANF) fraud, but the best guess is that it's about the same. A bevy of inspector general reports found ""improper payment"" levels of 20 to 40 percent in state TANF programs — but when you look at the reports, the payments appear all to be due to bureaucratic incompetence (categorized by the inspector general as either ""eligibility and payment calculation errors"" or ""documentation errors""), rather than intentional fraud by beneficiaries.

Found here http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/08/just-how-wrong-is-conventional-wisdom-about-government-fraud/278690/

TLDR the average fraud rate is 10 or 1% depending if you count the government doing an error as fraud. Most of those fraud are committed not by the recipient of the program but by someone else that can profit (like a doctor adding a few more expensive pills to the bill he send to the government) and those are the state from the USA so I'd guess it would be less in less individualist countries (but maybe more in ""corrupt"" cultures)",null,0,null,1436304093,null,0,false,0,csvgas1,null,t3_3ce93t,null,t1_csvgas1,null,t1_csuxqfp,null,null,null,1437668098,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Exemple : Si tu as aucune activité tu gagnes 800.

Si tu as un salaire à 1000€ tu gagnes 400€ + 1000 ça te fait 1400, c'est significativement mieux que 800, mais ça te place pas encore au niveau de celui qui gagne 1800.

Cela dit comme tout le monde s'en rapproche et que le coût de la vie augmente, celui qui gagne 1800 se fait un peu enfler... mais pas tant que ça, parce que lui va ptèt toucher 200€, et voir son revenu total augmenter à 2000.,

Et celui qui gagnait 2000, il aura ptèt 100€ et passera à 2100, donc il gagne quand-même un chouilla mieux que son collègue aux 1800 cité précédemment...

Bon il arrive un moment où le revenu ne rapporte plus rien, voire fait perdre légèrement en pouvoir d'achat, mais la différence devrait être relativement indolore, d'autant que dans la pratique on file déjà des proto-revenus de base aux sans-activités et à ceux ayant peu d'activité (RSA socle, RSA activité, prime pour l'emploi, allocation logement...) La différence c'est que celui qui touchait le RSA Socle ne se verra plus emmerdé jour et nuit pour retrouver une activité sous peine de se faire sucrer son seul revenu (la pression mise sur les allocataires du RSA est devenue très réelle ces dernières années, à mesure que les subsides de l'État se sont réduites pour les Départements, qui sont ceux qui doivent le payer).


Pour la pression fiscale, ça peut aussi rester relativement indolore dans la mesure où ça simplifiera beaucoup de choses au niveau administratif, réduisant les besoins en terme de personnel pour gérer le merdier. Et que ça évitera de payer prix d'or des boîtes privées pour fliquer les allocataires du RSA (les départements font des appels d'offres et payent des fortunes des entreprises privées censées faire de ""l'insertion professionnelle"" pour certains allocataires du RSA, dont le gros de l'activité consiste à les engueuler parce qu'ils ne cherchent pas assez bien du travail, et à les menacer de leur couper les vivres - et parfois quand ils ont le temps à leur relire un CV comme Pôle Emploi peut déjà le faire).


Bref, l'argent ne viendra de toute façon pas de nulle-part et cela pourra avoir des effets (inflationnistes ou de réduction de l'écart des revenus) à la marge, mais si on part sur l'idée d'un revenu dégressif, je pense pas que ça change radicalement le scénario d'ensemble.",null,0,null,1436304147,null,0,false,0,csvgc2s,null,t3_3ceysw,null,t1_csvgc2s,null,t1_csvek6d,null,null,null,1437668126,null,6,false,france,t5_2qhjz,6,null

About 2/3 of that debt is domestic, so external debt is not that high.

Regarding your original question: Italy's debt is sustainable. The debt profile is favourable, they can service it and are not about to default on it.

But having such high debt brings vulnerabilities and risks with it. And a serious shock hitting Italy's economy could lead to a situation where Italy's ability to service its debt could become under risk.

&gt; Annex I. Debt Sustainability Analysis  
&gt;
Italy’s public debt is sustainable but subject to significant risks. Italy’s public debt ratio continues to rise, and at around 136 percent of GDP, is the second highest in the euro area. External financing requirements and gross public financing needs are also large due to the rollover of existing debt. Most of the public debt is held domestically. Market risks are mitigated by the long duration of debt, much of which is under a fixed interest rate. The main risk stems from a growth shock, in the absence of structural reforms, which could result in an unfavorable macro-fiscal dynamics.

I am not familiar with your history with this user (who needs a flair very urgently given that the name sounds Greek but the arguments sound Bavarian), I think there could be some disconnect between you two in this: You argue that of course German exposure to Greek debt has been significant (and that, I think, is not disputable), while they argue that French exposure has been even bigger, in particular after factoring in relative sizes of economies. The motive behind pointing this out being that this crisis cannot and should not be reduced to a conflict solely between Greece and Germany. This has been annoying me, too, both over the last years and more so in the recent weeks. There have been a fair number of quite hostile comments to German(y|s). I considered mentioning that in my reply to you in the other thread but I decided that would look silly.

Under the first reform, the formal pension age for women was raised from 60 to 65 by the end of 2013. That was then yanked up for both men and women to 67, with effect from 2013. More important, the minimum retirement age was raised to 62 for both men and women and the number of contributions entitling a pensioner to a full benefit went up from 35 to 40 years; pensions taken before the age of 67 without a full contribution record were reduced in value. Accrual rates (the rate at which pension rights are built up each year) were slashed and benefits were based on career earnings rather than on final salaries, which brought the new system’s replacement rate for pensioners on average earnings down from 96% to 54%. The list of arduous trades treated more favourably was cut back and workers who were still covered could not retire before 62.

Because the creditors are not giving them what they want. So they will stall, give the same exact proposal with different wording, then stall, then give the exact same proposal with different wording, etc.

The eurogroup keeps pushing the deadline back because greece leaving the EU and EZ would be the start of the end of the EU and the EZ. It has shown to be true in history time and time again. When one leaves, others follow and the union doesn't survive without the exertion of force. 

&gt; What exactly are they playing at?

What we are seeing is that neither side is willing to compromise and neither side wants greece to leave the EU/eurozone. So the only option is to stall and hope the other side will give in. But nether side is willing to give in...

&gt;It's not easy to get agreement on actual fraud levels in government programs. Unsurprisingly, liberals say they're low, while conservatives insist they're astronomically high. In truth, it varies from program to program. One government report says fraud accounts for less than 2 percent of unemployment insurance payments. It's seemingly impossible to find statistics on ""welfare"" (i.e., TANF) fraud, but the best guess is that it's about the same. A bevy of inspector general reports found ""improper payment"" levels of 20 to 40 percent in state TANF programs — but when you look at the reports, the payments appear all to be due to bureaucratic incompetence (categorized by the inspector general as either ""eligibility and payment calculation errors"" or ""documentation errors""), rather than intentional fraud by beneficiaries.

Found here http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/08/just-how-wrong-is-conventional-wisdom-about-government-fraud/278690/

TLDR the average fraud rate is 10 or 1% depending if you count the government doing an error as fraud. Most of those fraud are committed not by the recipient of the program but by someone else that can profit (like a doctor adding a few more expensive pills to the bill he send to the government) and those are the state from the USA so I'd guess it would be less in less individualist countries (but maybe more in ""corrupt"" cultures)

**IMF has betrayed its mission in Greece, captive to EMU creditors**

&gt; Yet leaked minutes from the IMF board meetings showed that all the emerging market members (and Switzerland) opposed the terms of the first loan package for Greece. They protested that it was intended to save the euro, not Greece.

&gt; It loaded yet more debt onto the crushed shoulders of an already bankrupt country, and further complicated the picture by allowing one large French bank and one German bank – no names please – to offload much of their €25bn combined exposure onto EMU taxpayers.

&gt; “Debt restructuring should have been on the table,” said Brazil's member. The loans “may be seen not as a rescue of Greece, which will have to undergo a wrenching adjustment, but as a bailout of Greece’s private debt holders, mainly European financial institutions”.

---

&gt; Arvind Virmani, India’s member, was prophetic. ""The scale of the fiscal reduction without any monetary policy offset is unprecedented. It is a mammoth burden that the economy could hardly bear,” he said.

&gt; Care to see what happens to an economy where the banks are defrauded and not re-funded

I'm from Portugal. We just lost out biggest bank last year (BES), for holding too much bad debt. Before that we bailed out BCP, BPP and BPN. So yes I know how bad that is. 

[As a sidenote, the day Greece announced the referendum our stock market got hit harder then when BES failed]

But, first as I said, no one advocates the creditors should be ignored. However they should pay some price for overexposure. 

And more importantly, saving banks, could  be the choice of each nation. There was need to mutualise the collateral of French and German banks. France and Germany could well decide to help their banks if they chose to.

Here's the thing though: Tsipras said before the referendum that a No would strengthen their negotiation position.
How did this actually play out in the minds of the Greek who voted no?

They come out of economic necessity, and their family can live a better life if they send money back home.  

For legitimate refugees the statistic is a bit off. If the asylum seeker has actually received asylum, and their country has family reunion laws, they can apply to bring their family. And the family members don't have to apply for asylum individually, so they don't end up in the statistic. They ""just"" have to fill out a couple forms in an embassy or consulate. They have to prove why the family can only be restored if they come to EU country. Once that process is done and they are allowed to join the husband/father, they get papers that allow them to cross the EU border legally. 

If you aren't already in Europe (i.e. Balkan), and you can't board a plane, it's expensive and often dangerous to apply for asylum in the EU.

2. Have a flexible labor market. Again, Greece (and most of Europe tbh) fails on that.

Nobody can prevent Greece from continuing to use the Euro. 

The problem is that the Greek government needs money to pay pensions, public employees, etc. (I'm not talking about bank notes, but money.)

In case of default Greece has no access to capital markets, it has no support from ECB or IMF. So it would only be able to pay exactly as much as it can collect in taxes.

Without the ability to issue currency, the Greek government would be forced to cut pensions, wages etc, basically do all the odious ""austerity,"" only far more of it and all of it within days. 

&gt;What happens if they just refuse to service their debts? 

Servicing the debts costs currently about 4% of Greek GDP per year.

&gt;surely the European Central Bank will be obliged to continue to provide them with Euros

The effort to make Chinese GDP growth more sustainable is also a reason this is happening. The government is taking preventative measures to make the effects less painful.

C'est très vrai. Toute personne un peu informée sait que la BCE, depuis quelques temps, joue clairement avec les mots sur ses mandats pour faire un peu de politique alors qu'ils ne sont absolument pas censés le faire, et que cette politique est clairement orientée en faveur de la Grèce, et plus généralement des ""pays du Sud"". Il faut pas se tromper de cible : en ce moment, la BCE fait vraiment le maximum pour aider, voire + que le maximum.

&gt; C'était vrai en décembre 2014, c'est plus forcément vrai maintenant, j'ai pas vu de chiffres. Par contre ce qui sûr c'est que toute cette incertitude a fait s'écrouler les estimations de croissance ce qui doit signifier que les revenus de la Grèce ont diminué et que le pays ne dégage probablement plus d'excédent primaire.

C'est vrai que vu la déstabilisation de la Grèce ces derniers temps, l'excédent primaire ils peuvent faire une croix dessus pour 2015. Après, dans le scénario théorique d'une sortie de l'euro nette et d'une reprise normale des activités, on peut imaginer qu'ils y reviennent relativement vite.

&gt; Si la Grèce fait réellement défaut totalement, elle ne pourra pas emprunter pendant très longtemps et sera contrainte et forcer d'équilibrer son budget par des mesures d'austérité, très probablement des coupes budgétaires comme la troïka le demandait

Oui et non. Avec une sortie de l'Euro ils ont une nouvelle arme : la planche à billet. Évidemment ils connaissent le danger de la planche à billet : la spirale inflationniste. Mais l'inflation dépend aussi de très nombreux paramètres et s'ils usent du truc avec assez de parcimonie, ça peut leur permettre de dégager quelques marges de manœuvres sans voire l'inflation atteindre des sommets. Et puis au passage ce sera un moyen de dévaluer la monnaie, ce dont on dit qu'ils auraient cruellement besoin pour (re)devenir compétitifs et donc, à nouveau, dégager de l'excédent budgétaire, voire rééquilibrer leur balance commerciale.

Il est probable qu'ils en chient pendant quelques années, s'ils devaient faire défaut totalement et sortir de l'Euro, mais s'ils jouent bien le jeu, ils peuvent être complètement sur pieds d'ici une dizaine d'années.

Je crains que la chimio imposée par la Troïka entraîne plutôt, pour la décennie à venir, une lente agonie.

&gt;The Greek population is somewhat larger (ten million against less than four million for Puerto Rico). But in per capita terms, many indicators are of a similar magnitude. For both countries, GNP or GNI per capita are at about one-half of their respective ‘union’ average and wages are somewhat above one-half of their respective union averages.

&gt;The employment rates (and the fall in employment over the last years) are almost identical. Puerto Rico would have Greek style unemployment rates if emigration had not provided a safety valve.

&gt;In terms of the poverty rate, Puerto Rico does much worse than Greece (at over 45% versus 35.7% for Greece). This is surprising given the large transfers that flow to inhabitants of Puerto Rico in various forms of social security payments.

&gt;More surprising are perhaps the similarities in the terms of fiscal problems. Public debt is, of course, much lower as a percentage of ‘national’ income. ***But the more appropriate comparison would be the debt burden relative to public revenues.*** On this account, Puerto Rico appears even more over-indebted than Greece. **Its public debt is higher relative to government revenues (4.5 times) than that of Greece (‘only’ 3.87 times revenues), and its government devotes a higher share of revenues to interest payments (13%) than Greece’s government does at present (‘only’ 8.5%).**

&gt;Puerto Rico thus appears even more over-indebted than Greece on both accounts. It is therefore not surprising that the ratings of the two governments are almost identical and that the yield on Puerto Rico’s state and state-guaranteed debt is similar to that of Greece.",null,0,null,1436307460,null,0,false,0,csvih70,null,t3_3cgpr6,null,t1_csvih70,null,t1_csvfhje,null,null,null,1440493534,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

That language is hard. I have an online friend from Volendam who came here to see me. Never heard so much xh kh krh ghr sounds before. His name is Gerrit, coincidentally.

The system itself works and takes the difficulty of the language into account. People staying here for more than 6 months have to take an exam (""Danish Test 1/Danskprøve 1"") within 6 months to continue their stay. It is the kind of test no one fails. Students arrive stressed and come out 20 minutes later feeling relieved. The extremely few who do fail get a chance to retake it. Semesters are called modules and must also be passed with an exam, though flexibility is given so you have at least a little space for deciding when you are ready to give it a go (as failing can mean you get transferred to a lower-level class). My problem is not the system, but the teachers. They do not teach well. It seems like they get distracted by how basic the level is and then just go teaching whatever they want in stead of preparing people for the specifics of the next exam. My wife has been there for 3 years now. Every exam has had lots of material the teachers never covered, that she had to find out about online (which the teachers never mentioned, except to say there are ""sample exams"" on a state website). She has been one of the few to complain about the status quo, which has led to one teacher being demoted and two classes nearly going on strike, so to speak. This was following two exams with different teachers at different levels who had done so bad a job that 0% of the class were able to pass the exam. Not a single one. Danish is my wife's 6th language. She speaks 5 fluently. If they can get the right people, though, there's a lot of hope.

I am like you in being fine as long as people keep trying, and accents are also fine.

so werden Sie darin ein Mittel haben, dass die Mäuse dieses Feld
meiden. Nun sind sie Freche Tiere, sie kommen wieder hervor,
wenn der Pfeffer so ausgestreut ist, dass in der Nähe etwas pfefferlos
geblieben ist. Da nisten sie sich wieder ein. Das heißt, die
Wirkung strahlt weit aus, aber es könnte ja doch geschehen,
dass die Dinge nicht ganz durchgeführt werden. Aber es ist ganz
gewiss eine radikale Wirkung, wenn in der ganzen Nachbarschaft
dasselbe gemacht wird. Ich glaube, an solchen Dingen
könnte man sogar viel Freude haben. Es würde einem können

Even mentioning it has no more sting--because we're a hair's breadth away from Grexit now, and all that has to happen for that to occur is doing nothing over the rest of the week. 

Maybe a month ago talk like this would have sent people scurrying. But not now. The stakes are raised and Grexit talk is par for the course. 

It's the smiles, unexpected smiles, that got my attention. People behaving uncharacteristically happy, in such a crucial and dramatic moment.

And things not going exactly as everyone planned--the delay in the letter, for example. We hear these kinds of incredible things about the Greek delegation, not prepared, no package, sent the wrong letter, fonts wrong, etc. And every time, we find out these things weren't actually that way, the media jumped the gun, and more importantly there's something we don't know about. In this case, it's everyone doing pre-talking before the talking, so that they walk in knowing what comes next. I think they knew they were going to work it out from previous high-level talks before today.

I wouldn't worry about the markets--they want resolution. I also wouldn't worry about the money. Money doesn't matter to ECB. Debt doesn't matter to the ECB. Money can be made from nothing in this system. It's stability that matters--it's agreement that matters. Getting everyone back to the table, by each having tested the other one, means that there's no more games to play, and no more manoeuvres. Now we get the deal we could have had earlier, now only because the real fight is over.

At that point Greece's banking system would face imminent collapse, effectively making Grexit inevitable, even in the absence of any further action from the EU, its members, and institutions. In any case, European leaders have explicitly said that they have already developed a plan that would see Greece leave the Eurozone and are ready to implement it on Sunday, unless a deal is reached by then. The next few days should be interesting...

It's pretty obvious it would be in Greece's and other Southern European countries interest if they were still able to print their own currency. A) To reduce their debt burden and B) to devalue the currency so their exports etc. become more competetive (of course within limits).

The ECB has engaged in aggressive quantative easing sending boatloads of free money to banks to hopefully stimulate the economy, yet banks still don't really borrow to SME´s. Why can't we simply redefine the ECB's role and allow it to print the money to help greece instead of just throwing more and more money at banks which is what we are doing now. I know right now theyre supposedly not allowed to but isnt it much better if this money goes to people or countries in need directly instead of them having to borrow it from financial instutions that get the money for free from the ECB?

Yes this might very slightly devalue the Euro, but this has been the objective of the ECB with the QE in the first place and would only help make Europe more competetive.

So yeah, if anyone could enlighten me on this point because as far as Im concerned we could just have the ECB print the needed money (within reasonable limits) and help Greece out with the haircut even the IMF says is needed. No taxpayers of individual countries on the hook, win-win or not?

I know many belief the Greeks have to suffer for their fiscal policies, but there is only so much you can expect from a country that had well over 5 years of severe austerity, and by these austerity measures might have cut the nominal deficit but with a rapidly dropping GDP still has the debt-to-GDP at unsustainable levels. The entiry politics of austerity for 5+ years now have done nothing to actually help the people. Yet banks have survived the crisis here in Europe unscathed thanks to the truckloads of money we shipped to them, bonuses are still huge for bankers and virtually no regulation has been passed yet to reign them in.

- Raise income tax to 75% for all incomes over 500,000 euros.

- Nationalisation of banks.

- Nationalisation of private hospitals. 

Note they meant all banks and all private hospitals, you can look it up. That is definitely a radical-left program.

This is also part of their delusion, when they compare themselves to the Nordic countries and people buy that shit up. Unfortunately it couldn't be more wrong. What was going on in Sweden in the 1960s was exactly the opposite of what Siriza wants, they implemented the concept of structural budget equilibrium.

Even though I have worked for a Greek company and I personally know a number of Greeks and I have visited Greece on a number of occasions, not only leisure.

The prevailing attitude on most media doesn't help much and basically the public opinion shared by the majority goes along the lines of ""They deserve it because they are lazy, they don't think about the consequences, they think they have kind of privileged status, Europe should stop feeding this spoiled nation"" and so on.

Now generalizing people is stupid and especially the ""Greeks are lazy"" part is crap - for all I can tell the set of ""lazy"" people here percent-wise is higher than the set of ""lazy"" people in Greece. I also read some statistics that more or less changed my mind. Anyway in my humble opinion, Greece is more to blame for this and by Greece I don't mean Greeks as people (and not even the ***** leftist anarchists so common in Athens). It's the Greek state which is horribly mismanaged. And to someone that comes from a poorer country that had LOTS of issues due to bad state policies and poor management, they are immediately obvious. I can give many examples, some of them like I've never paid a single cent of toll tax on Egnatia Odos highway for so many time until I saw the tolls somewhere near Thessaloniki and was surprised to find out that it's not free. And I've driven there for many kilometers on a number of occasions. Perhaps all my routes magically bypassed the toll payment points, but this was in no way intentional. Bars, cafeterias and stuff especially at seaside, but also in big cities most of the time never give you a proper cash receipt the same type that you get in a supermarket or a petrol station. Instead you get some sheet of paper with a hand-written amount on it. I know why is that cause I've seen that happening here in the 90s - tax evasion. 

Anyway I hope Greece gets out of that crisis, that region here is not ""easy"" one and having the only neighbouring developed country sink into a severe crisis and instability will definitely be a problem for us as well.

Well, several of the things you list as ""radical left"" are seen as center-left in the Nordic countries, so parts of the comparison seem legitimate to me, even if they differ in other ways. For example point #3, centralizing ownership of hospitals in the hands of the state, is not really a radical-left position, but just a standard approach to a national public health system (private hospitals are not legal in Denmark except for non-medically-necessary things like plastic surgery, and only the radical libertarians are really pushing for private hospitals).

&gt;Life in Belgium! Who can say? It is a place of extremes - of wonders and surprises, of adventures and industry, of mystery and nature.

&gt;Much is in flux in the Kingdom of Belgium, with the recent abdication of the old king, Albert II The Jolly. How will court life in Belgium adapt? Will the nobles accept the new King - Philip I The Stiff - or will they raise the banner of rebellion? Rumors on the palace grounds suggest the Scorned Prince (Laurent) plans to challenge his older brothers' leadership, and plenty of intrigue is also centered on the Illegitimate Pretender, Delphine The Artist - born out of wedlock, conceived on one of the campaigns Albert II The Jolly undertook in the savage south of Belgium.

&gt;Speaking of the Savage South - the tribes are growing restless. The Walloon Clan Chiefs groan that their gods are being dishonored by the Grand Vizier Bart the Once Fat, and his puppet the Chancellor Michel the Fils-à-Papa. Will they unfurl the banners of revolt? Will they gather into a new Grand Heathen Army, and march on the Northern Lands, burning and plundering Social Security as they go along? Who can truly say what lives in the heart of these wondrous creatures.

&gt;The Turk also remains a growing menace. Grand Vizier Bart the Once Fat has unfurled his plans to station two soldiers at the door the castle of each Job Creator (the ancient and rightful ruling class of the Kingdom of Belgium). Already, hapless peasants - grown soft under the rule of Albert II The Jolly and the Socialist Cabal - are being pulled from the field and enlisted into the Grande Armée. No longer will the Job Creator, noblest of all creatures, have to live in fear of the Turk, who hides behind each blade of grass! Gladly will the filthy peasants of Belgium support and protect the exalted Job Creators, the guardians and creators of all that is true and beautiful in the Kingdom.

&gt;And thus, among all this confusion, a stranger - hailing from distant lands - arrives on our shores, looking for naught but a hovel with a large piece of land. Is he but a visitor, or something more? Is he the One That Was Foretold? The One that will lead the Kingdom into a new and glorious future? The One that will once and for all unite the Savage Tribes of the Walloons, the Filthy Peasants of Flanders, and the Noble Job Creators? The One that will finally defeat The Turk? Break the power of the Socialist Cabal?

&gt;King Filip I The Stiff calls his council, and ponders. Great things are afoot for this once sleepy Kingdom.

I consistently pay a premium for steaks from scotland as they taste better, to add to my point why do you think ""angus"" beef has a premium name and price attached. 

There is for sure a difference between the climate of Romania and western europe, for starters I would assume beef cows from France spend more time on grass than Romanian cows thanks to the shorter winter and grass fed beef always tastes better. 

There is also the fact many of the best known beef breeds come from France so assume they have a good reputation in the beef business and I should know, I eat a lot of the stuff and Finnish beef is beyond shit and is mainly just grinded up old dairy cows that got too old for milking over animals which have been raised purely for beef.

Then they have the big fight. Greece goes home. You see Tsiparas on the podium. Greek flags waving. 

Then we go back to Brussels, and all the big powers are meeting. And there's Merkel with misty eyes saying how they're doing everything they can, and the problems are spinning out of control, and they can't give up on Greece, and the others say 'We have to go the extra mile this time' or some other cheesy line.

Tsiparas says 'Ok. We can do that.'

Sustainable state is the key here. Since the troikas proposals were rejected, the Greek government needs to come up with some proposals that would turn Greece into a sustainable state.

Now, the EU people don't really think there are alternatives, but they are still willing to listen. That's why there are meetings with the Greek government. However, in their belief that there are no alternatives, the summit on Sunday (I think) is all about handling a grexit.

&gt;I always hear about how awesome the liberals are because they break down people's regional identities and makes us all more alike with this 'nation state' idea. Why is this even a good thing? I love diversity, and I feel like nation state has gone out of its way to kill diversity on the continent.

Hopefully, the support of national identities will take a fatal blow the same way support of regional identities took a fatal blow in past times. The difference between my Danish self, a German, a Frenchman, a Brit, a Greek, or an Italian, is just not big enough for me to feel like I should go ""hæhæhæ, Danmark, Danmark, Danmark, bedst af alle!"" and the Frenchman « honhonhon, la France, la France, la France, la meilleure entre les tous ! » I feel like today's differences are more clear between continents. It would be a positive development on the path to one-world-ism to start talking about ""continentalism"" in stead of ""nationalism"".

...but you do realize that diversity hasn't been dying out at all, right? Right?

It's at an all-time high because people today are able to shape their own destinies now more than they ever were. Subcultures, style communities, and ideological/philosophical/religious communities are *culture*.

We don't need borders to preserve culture. Culture is a dynamic phenomenon that develops over time.

EDIT: You can also get along with people of a billion other cultures if you have even basic pluricultural competence. (There's a great definition by the Council of Europe [in this report](http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Source/SourcePublications/CompetencePlurilingue09web_en.pdf), posted below.)

&gt;Plurilingual  and  pluricultural  competence  refers  to the ability to use languages for the purposes of communication and to take part in intercultural interaction, where a person, viewed as a social actor has proficiency, of varying degrees, in several languages and experience of several cultures. This is not seen as the superposition or juxtaposition of distinct competences, but rather as the existence of a complex or even composite competence on which the social actor may draw (p. 11)

  * Peu de vidéo-surveillance
  * Pas de dispositif de détection moderne
  * Personnel en sous-effectif pour surveiller des terrains super grands
  * Matériel peu protégé ( quelques cadenas )

La réalité, c'est que le matériel volé, bien qu'inquiêtant entre les mains de quidams mal intentionnés, n'est pas du tout critique pour les opérations de l'armée de terre et donc avait une protection de façade. S'il y a bien une chose dont elle dispose c'est de stocks d'explosifs dépassés et pas très pratiques dans des guerres de projection en Afrique et en Asie où on se repose plus sur des appuis aériens/véhiculés, de la présence de terrain et de l'information que sur du pétage d'infrastructure ou du combat de proximité. 

Les craintes sur ces stocks, jusqu'à aujourd'hui concernaient plutôt ce que les officiers désignent sous le terme d'aléa humain à savoir un trouffion (pas une flèche en général, surtout s'il est légionnaire) qui ramènerait des grenades chez lui ou qui se ferait sauter avec en faisant sa manoeuvre bourré (ce qu'on a connu, il y a quelques années, avec l'abruti qui avait tiré à balles réelles et blessé des civils pendant une opération de communication). 

L'hypothèse très probable, est celle d'un ancien militaire qui aurait vendu la mêche de ce manque de sécurité à des fins idéologiques ou crapuleuses (un terro ou un bandit quoi). Il faut bien comprendre que l'armée a beaucoup trop d'inertie et de bureaucratie pour y faire quoique ce soit. Et puis je dirais que c'est une sorte de rétribution karmique. On trimballe des guignols dans les villes de France et de Navarre, avec des flingues dont ils n'ont pas le droit de se servir. On les fatigue avec ces missions inutiles. On les rend visible à des fins politiques. On en fait une cible facile de discrédit. 

Cela montre aussi l'imbécilité d'un système politique qui vacille entre le bénin et le complexe, entre la communication pour justifier les mauvaises décisions et les mauvaises décisions pour des raisons de communication. Certaines têtes vont peut-être rouler. Le ministre a passé ses nerfs sur deux, trois gradés.

Ce qui est intéressant quand on s'intéresse au personnage de Friedrich Hayek, c'est qu'en période de guerre froide il a voulu redéfinir le totalitarisme en prenant soin d'écarter ce qui le liait au fascisme Mussolinien (anti-démocratie, rejet de l'égalité au profit d'un ordre ""naturel"", hiérarchie des peuples faibles soumis aux peuples forts) tout en le rapprochant du communisme Stalinien. 
Sachant qu'on lui doit aussi cette belle tirade à l'époque de la dictature de Pinochet : « Je dirai que, comme institutions pour le long terme, je suis complètement contre les dictatures. Mais une dictature peut être un système nécessaire pour une période transitoire. Parfois il est nécessaire pour un pays d'avoir, pour un temps, une forme ou une autre de pouvoir dictatorial. [...] Personnellement je préfère un dictateur libéral plutôt qu'un gouvernement démocratique manquant de libéralisme. Mon impression personnelle est que [...] au Chili par exemple, nous assisterons à la transition d'un gouvernement dictatorial vers un gouvernement libéral ».

Education in Belgium is completely split between the communities since 1988: the Flemish educational system and the Frenchspeaking system. A community has no business in telling the other how to run its education, especially when it comes to language. This is the result of a long historic battle, where the Flemish had to fight for their right to be educated in their own language and not in French, and cultural autonomy in general. Only in 1930 the University of Gent became the first to have Dutch as its official language and offer education in Dutch, this in a region where everyone but a select elite was natively Dutchspeaking. This battle lasted until 1968 after two years of massive Flemish student riots in Leuven ([Leuven Vlaams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_University_of_Leuven_\(1834–1968\)#The_split_.281962.E2.80.931970.29)), which led to the split of the bilingual Catholic University of Leuven. The French wing of the university was forcefully moved to Wallonia (Louvain-La-Neuve). 

In Flanders, French as a second language has always been compulsory in school, as French was an economic necessity. On top of that there's English (and limited German) in secondary school. As Flanders prevails economically, the importance of French dwindles. The motivation for French drops, yet it's still compulsory. As a result, the level of French proficiency drops. The Flemish can hold a basic conversation in French, but usually won't be fluent unless confronted with it professionally on a daily basis.

In the Frenchspeaking system, Dutch has always been optional. Dutch is an option among English or German. Yet as the importance of Dutch rises, the motivation to teach or learn it does not. Neither does any demand to make it compulsory. As a matter of fact, more and more students opt for English instead of Dutch. This tends to rub off the wrong way in Flanders and is interpreted along the historic disdain of Dutch; they'd rather learn a foreign language than the language of their compatriots who live a stone's throw to the north. For many in Flanders, as long as this motivation in the south is lacking, there's little motivation to keep Belgium running.

If we take into account only the Muslim portion of the population (90 percent in Kosovo and 70 percent in Albania), then there are approximately 92 ISIS fighters per 1 million Kosovo Muslims and there are 65 ISIS fighters per 1 million Albania Muslims. This means that there is a bigger amount of Kosovar Albanians going to ISIS, around 40 percent more. Still, it remains incomparable with Bosnia Herzegovina which has 92 ISIS fighters per 1 million inhabitants. Taking into account only the Muslim population (approximately 50 percent), then there are 184 fighters per 1 million Muslims of Bosnia.

What I was taking about is the perception that exists in Albania that Kosovar Albanians are more devout than the Albanian Muslims. This is something that has been described by different historians through the ages, who describe Ghegs (northern part of Albania including Kosovo and Macedonian) as more devout Sunnis, while the Tosks (southern Albania) had a lot of mystic Sufi sects like Bektashi which were a bit less fanatic. Then, during the communist regime of Enver Hoxha, Albania was the only atheist state in the world and freedom of religion was abolished. This was a fundamental repression of human rights, but it had the consequence of making the country more secular and since then there have been a lot of marriages between people of different religious backgrounds, something which was not a common occurrence before.

Everytime people say that austerity is bad i like to remind them you can vote for governments to pretend math isnt real but in the end its more real then the government thinking they can spend sky high and nothing bad happens *if you overspend*. 

People can vote to ignore reality and math if they want to ether it be electing a leftwing government that promises to ""END AUSTERITY &gt;.&lt;"" Or vote in a referendum that they don't have to pay back. Theres no ""if i don't see it then it will just go away!!"" Regarding debt.


&gt;The entiry politics of austerity for 5+ years now have done nothing to actually help the people. 

So large government spending in greece helped greeks short term and screwed them over when that spending became limited so why should the ECB just throw money at greece so they can spend again?

But as well use euros as toilet paper.




&gt; Why can't we simply redefine the ECB's role and allow it to print the money to help greece instead of just throwing more and more money at banks which is what we are doing now.

Their already doing that by giving greek banks liquidity despite the obvious low grade collateral they presented to the ECB.

Also moral hazard. If ECB saves greece and then funds their government and their government then spends skyhigh. There's nothing prevent the rest of southern european countries to then elect M5S or podemos, from doing the same and demanding the same treatment. 

Also it will cause hyperinflation of the euro currency if it happens.

The Greek economy has shrunk by around 25% since 2009; unemployment stands at 27%, with youth unemployment at nearly 50%. When Germany faced comparable conditions in the early 1930s, its creditors shrugged, and the resulting instability allowed for the rise of Adolf Hitler. **After World War II, however, Germany’s debt was slashed, enabling it to rebuild. Given this experience, it should understand the importance of cutting a country’s debt when the burden of servicing it becomes unsustainable.**

If you don't consider those people, Nationalism can be a good thing, since it promotes social cohesion, gives people the feeling of belonging (which is very important for the human psyche) and makes people want to contribute to the betterment of their nation. Which means less crime and corruption and more hard working individuals. 

I believe a lot of the problems in third-world countries stem from lacking a national identity, they don't give a shit about their country so they emigrate, take bribes, vandalize etc. (Not everyone of course)

All European countries and people are nationalist to some degree, even when they don't realize this themselves, or we'd be all living in Sweden, Finland or UK. We wouldn't have borders, we would grant anyone citizenship, start using the English language instead etc.

The banks were also not given the money, they sold shares that Greece can now sell to help pay down the debt. Of the €48.2bn shares that were bought it is expected that they will get €27.3bn back, and have already gotten €11.4bn back.

This seems to shed some light on this issue: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis#Impact_of_the_conducted_bank_recapitalization

You also mention currency devaluation as a solution, but since Greece does not have it's own currency to devaluate what do you suggest? Is it the troikas fault that Greece couldn't devaluate their currency?

Russia has done too many horrible things to china that there will never be a ""comprehensive strategic alliance"" with russia.

China and russia together can't shift it from unipolar to a multipolar world either. China and russia combined have a smaller economy than the US. China and russia combine have a weaker military than the US. So lets stop kidding ourselves.

Being both English and Irish, I'm proud of both identities, and I'm proud of being European. I don't see a conflict there - Irish and English are both European identities, not American or Asian or African.

On the other hand, if the creditors give in to Greece, there is the risk that the opposite happens, and Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Italy all elect Syriza-like parties and request the same conditions.

As for richer countries like France or Germany, I can see many voters voting for anti-EU parties exactly because they don't want to give more money to Greece (as polls have shown, the popular opinion in those countries is overwhelmingly against giving more money to Greece).

null,false,Beerkar,BELG,Belgium,null,"&gt; So does this show itself almost like racism except it's based on language?

It's never been a matter of genetics, but of culture. Belgian society has been described in academics as being divided by fractures. Catholic vs atheist, Flemish vs Walloon, labour vs capital. These fractures are created by conflicts and over long periods these fractures are institutionalised ([Pillarisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillarisation#Belgium)). After the religious fracture became more or less irrelevant the past half century, the cultural (Flemish vs Walloon) and socio-economic (poor vs rich) fractures have become increasingly intertwined: a rich Flanders vs a poor Wallonia. Political discourse will evidently run parallel with these fractures. As the Flemish economy became dominant in the 1960s, the language issues and the Flemish demands for equal rights became dominant. On the matter of language the existing fractures became insurmountable and they split the traditional ideological fractions. We now have two socialist, liberal, christian-democrat and green parties in Belgium, each language group has one. More and more you get two parallel democracies within Belgium. 

The divide however isn't new. The border between Romance and Germanic Europe has been here since the Roman era. 

&gt;Julius Caesar conquered Gaul in 57 BC. The Low Countries became part of the larger Gallia Belgica province which originally stretched from southwestern Germany to Normandy and the southern part of the Netherlands. The population of this territory was Celtic with a Germanic influence which was stronger in the north than in the south of the province. Gallia Belgica became progressively romanized. The ancestors of the Walloons became Gallo-Romans and were called the ""Walha"" by their Germanic neighbours. The ""Walha"" abandoned their Celtic dialects and started to speak Vulgar Latin

&gt;Are Dutch speakers just Belgians who speak Dutch or do they consider themselves Belgians with a Dutch background, and vice versa?

The first. We speak Dutch (language) but we aren't Dutch (nationality). Just like Austrians aren't German, but are Germanic. The Dutchspeaking vs Frenchspeaking terminology is a result of the wording in the constitution, which assigns the proportion of seats to the language groups. Most Dutchspeakers identify - in some way or the other - as Flemish. The territory of modern Flanders consists mostly of the historical counties of Flanders and Brabant. Contrary to those south of the language barrier, we not only fought off those pesky Romans, we also fought off the [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francization_of_Brussels#French_rule). Although the historic struggle is heavily romanticised (heh), it did work as a binding factor in Flanders. 

This isn't really the case for Frenchspeakers, they don't really identify as Walloon. They identify as Belgian, as French was inclusive in the new Belgian state. 

Another thing that's important to remember in all this is that the country is about 60% Dutchspeaking and 40% Frenchspeaking. Yet for the most part of the country's history, that majority was treated as a minority.",null,0,null,1436318865,null,0,1436319219,0,csvp29g,null,t3_3cg7vl,null,t1_csvp29g,null,t1_csvn5a3,null,null,null,1437674308,null,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9,null

null,false,JumpCrissCross,UNSA,United States of America,null,"&gt;Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, brushed aside suggestions that a short-term financing deal could be reached to take Athens through the summer before a two or three-year bailout agreement is agreed, insisting that the Greek government come forward with a full range of reforms that could cover a multiyear programme.

&gt;[Merkel] warned that, with the Greek economy in a tailspin, Athens would have to suggest new ways to make up an even bigger fiscal gap than before Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, was forced to close his country’s banks last week. She gave Athens until Thursday to present those plans.

&gt;Many eurozone officials expressed extreme pessimism that a deal could be reached — Ms Merkel said she was not “somebody who is very optimistic” — and many said they had become resigned to Greece exiting the eurozone.

&gt;Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president...signalled that emergency central bank loans keeping the banks alive, which the ECB must approve, could not be extended beyond the weekend.

&gt;The ECB is weighing whether to withdraw the emergency loans — it receives government-backed securities as collateral for the loans, which become worthless if Greece goes bankrupt — and has indicated that it will ask eurozone leaders to guarantee Greece’s solvency before cutting the aid.

&gt;The decision to invite all 28 countries to deal with the Greek crisis is unprecedented and a clear indication that leaders fear the country could be heading for economic chaos. Mr Tusk, who was responsible for summoning all 28 leaders to Brussels, said “humanitarian action” would be among the topics to be discussed.

I hope The Economist isn't too much of a lefty rag to [serve as source](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/06/greek-pensions):

&gt;GREEK pensions have been a source of acrimony since the first bail-out five years ago. [..] Yet since then there have been two major reforms, pushing the statutory retirement age up from 60 for women and 65 for men to 67, while pension benefits have been cut. [..]
&gt;
&gt; in the course of austerity, pension benefits were not spared. Two seasonal bonuses were eliminated, an effective cut of 14% for the two-thirds of retirees in the main private-sector fund drawing the minimum pension. Cuts for better-off pensioners were much higher, with reductions of over 40%.

Or the [Financial Times, maybe] (http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/9954a330-fa2b-11e4-b432-00144feab7de.html#axzz3fDmaI3oB):

&gt;As a former Greek public sector employee, Mr Akrithakis has seen his pension cut eight times in the past five years, slashing his monthly stipend by almost 45 per cent.

Seriously. I don't doubt that you really thought you were right, and did not intend to lie, but the peddling of these myths has to stop. There are still major issues with the Greek pensions system, but what you wrote is just plain not true, not by a long shot.

Moreover, 45 per cent of pensioners receive monthly payments below the poverty line of 665 euros, the government says. With more than a quarter of Greek workers jobless, many rely on parents and grandparents for financial support. [..]
&gt;
&gt;On average Greek men now retire at 63 and women at 59, according to government data. In Germany, the average retirement age for those receiving an old age pension in 2014 was 64 years.

That said, here's my take on the situation: As [u/Tirkad](reddit.com/user/Tirkad) said, I believe most of the hate goes to the government. It's deeply ingrained in everyone, that if you owe someone something, you appear courteous to those. The former government, for all its faults, knew this. Before Syriza, Greece had many allies around Europe. Right now, most of these are gone. Through Varoufakis, Greece lost most of its diplomatic capital, both in political circles, but especially in the eyes of the public. It has been established, that Syrizas agenda has been delaying the deal until the very last minute. Syriza has been using every trick in the book and then some to delay making a deal. The belief is that this will make the ""Troika"" break. But after every new trick, the trust has been less and less. The last straw was the referendum. The people in most other countries are getting the feeling, that Greece is trying to trick us, which is probably not far from the truth. The further we get, the closer the acts of the negotiators look like that of a con-man. In the end, this falls back to the Greek people. Because *who elected these clowns?*

The other major emotion people seem to have is fright. The more information we get about how the Greek society works, the scarier it becomes. When it comes to statecraft, efficiency is king. What we see, resembles Sicily, the Middle East or Africa. Tax evasion is *still* not only widespread, but the natural state of things, corruption is again the norm, not abnormal. If inefficiency isn't enough, there's the question of responsibility. Right now, everyone knows that Greece spent way too much, and loaned way too much money. This was something several different governments took part in. So it begs the question: ""What stops it from happening again?"" It's not like the whole of Europe now feels like Greece has straightened up. The Greek people, after all elected Syriza *and* voted NO in the last referendum. (This last one is deeply unfair, I know, but I'm trying to portrait what people think and say). 

So when we're faced with the irresponsibility, the inefficiency/incompetence and rejection of austerity combined with asking for more loans, I don't think it's odd that people are wondering whether any further funding of Greece will be pouring money into a black hole.

That being said, I pity the Greek people. You are between a rock and a hard place. It might not even be possible for you to reform the country as the ""Troika"" wishes. Whatever might be the outcome of the next days or weeks, I hope that you'll be able to come around economically and prosper.

Things have only declined in this past twenty years as the neo liberals go unopposed and consolidate wealth and power, sorry but I think you are just so naive to what you are really asking for it hurts, thinking people leading the entire would would have good motives was your first mistake. you don't get into politics unless you want power and unopposed power is the worst thing going.",null,0,null,1436319679,null,0,false,0,csvpiml,null,t3_3cgmou,null,t1_csvpiml,null,t1_csvophf,null,null,null,1440493261,null,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6,null

- for electro, there are lots of places in the marais that are great. most are gay but that's often where the best music is to be found.. other than that you'd be lookin at other arrondissements 
- go with Free, TV and free long distance to most places is included, as well as a sim card for a mobile phone (or pay an extra 2eur for unlimited data+talk+text for that sim iirc)
- Monoprix on Rivoli is the closest big supermarket, but go to Paris Store any day or Aligre market for cheaper stuff. The market on Rue Saint-Louis en l'ile is pretty pricey
- try the young brie at the cheese shop on Ile Saint-Louis. It is one of the things I miss the most
- the best bread is at the boulangerie by 35 rue des deux ponts, namely their traditions
- swimming pools aren't that great in Paris, plus most make you wear a swimming cap... take weekend trips to somewhere for that purpose instead

null,false,PniboR,FLAN,Flanders,null,"I'm certainly not an expert on Finland but the country interests me and I've read a fair deal about it on Wikipedia. I think Belgium is to some extent comparable to Finland, in the sense that you've got a minority language that historically dominated the ""language of the people"" (though the proportion of speakers is very different).

As for identity in Belgium, we've been part of many empires, and our current country is quite ""accidentally"" put together. In essence, we're a bunch of people that happen to live in the same country. French was the language of the elite. In Wallonia you had dialects that were close to French, whereas in Flanders you had many Dutch/Germanic dialects, so back in the day Flemish people couldn't advance in society (summarised). Walloon dialects were mostly replaced by standard French, Flemish dialects converged to Dutch with a ""tussentaal"" in addition.

Now, it isn't really racism (though you have [some extremists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JupURwye3rM) bordering to ""racism""), but generally it can be a very sensitive issue, especially in politics. Basically, (historically) Flemish people adapt whereas French-speakers don't and tend to impose their language.

Back when Wallonia was economically superior, [there was a huge migration from Flemish people to Wallonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_immigration_to_Wallonia). They had to adapt, and French-speaking elite did everything to make sure they did. Hence many Walloons have Flemish heritage and Flemish last names. Even now still, when a Flemish goes living in Wallonia, he adapts and speaks French.

On the other hand, when French-speakers come live in Flanders, they tend to feel ""this is my country so I should be able to live here in my own language.""

The essential difference is that between the ""personality principle"" and ""territoriality principle"". We settled on the latter, meaning Flemish territory = Dutch, Wallonia = French and Brussels = bilingual territory. Still, if French-speakers had their way, it would be territorial in Wallonia (unilingually French) and personality principle in Flanders (Dutch or French, depending on a person's wish), which would of course be very unfair.

In 1963 we did indeed fix the ""language border"" separating these territories (resulting in heavy flights in especially Voeren and Komen-Waasten, they switched language). Not long after this, federalisation of Belgium began and political parties were split along the linguistic divide.

Something essential to add is Brussels: it used to be ""Flemish"" (ambiguous terminology I'd wish to explain too) but was [virtually completely Frenchified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francization_of_Brussels). Nowadays there are still issues in that the Brussels government is supposed to be bilingual, but often isn't in practice. And there are a few suburbs/towns around Brussels that are in Flemish language area but have increasingly become French-speaking (as I said above, they tend to not adapt to the local language). (This is where I live fwiw)

I would say nowadays, except as for politics, the issue is more alive in &amp; around Brussels than in the rest of the country. I can think of many experiences where Walloons in restaurants/cafés/etc can speak Dutch whereas in Brussels they either don't or simply refuse to.

I'm sorry for the long answer without much structure, and it might have gotten a bit off-topic, but I hope this helps.

The problem is that while some periphery states made good use of this money, such as Ireland, others did not.

Within 20 years of EU membership Ireland went from being an impoverished country to an immensely wealthy one. Although careless governance led Ireland to seek a bailout its underlying infrastructure was still in place and ready to take off once the worst was over, resulting in last year's growth rate of 4.8%.

Greece on the other hand didn't really do the leg work needed to improve its economy when the going was good. In a sense it was the grasshopper to Ireland's ant.

But this of course all goes back to the origins of the euro. In theory Greece should have developed enough to be in good shape to join the euro but it was not and it still joined. As a result the blame lies with the Greece and the EU. The EU was right to give EU funds to Greece and other periphery economies. Greece was wrong to not adequately invest those funds. But the EU was wrong to ignore Greece's failure and allow them into the Euro.

But the problem isn't the euro. It creates problems by not allowing these countries to devalue, but it also creates advantages such as boosting trade. Creating a new drachma will be the opposite. It'll devalue, but concerning trade that'll be a nightmare. The reason why is that unlike Ireland, Greece is not an export driven economy. It imports about twice as much as it exports (unlike Ireland which exports far more than it imports), meaning that a devaluation will mean more competitive exports but incredibly expensive imports, resulting in a potentially much larger deficit in its balance of payments than even today.

On top of that, if Greece has to be boosted from the EU in order to leave the Eurozone, it could lose the benefits of the common market, making trade even more difficult.",null,0,null,1436322463,null,0,false,0,csvr3ui,null,t3_3cepxr,null,t1_csvr3ui,null,t1_csuylw7,null,null,null,1437675971,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

null,false,Meatsim1,UNSA,United States of America,null,"A big problem with the US Army is the way it handles its personnel.  The cost of benefits are skyrocketing and the service of most professional Soldiers is often not done so much out of pride or patriotism but out of a desire/need for those benefits.  A lot of it comes from the desire to not remove Soldiers who are largely unable to fully serve due to medical conditions, family needs, etc.  

The Army does not want to be seen kicking people out if they say develop substance abuse problems or undergo a divorce that leaves them with little option for childcare because many of these things are directly related to the stress of service.  Then of course you have the ""20 or nothing"" retirement where a Soldier has to serve 20 years to be eligible for a life-time pension of 50% of his pay.  If he leaves before that he gets no pension.

50% for life is an insanely large amount of money especially for someone in their 40s.  It can be 50-60K a year in PENSION starting at age 42-43 for life.  Another way to look at it is the Army would pay a junior enlisted Soldier on his fourth year roughly 28-29K a year, so basically a retired senior officer consumes the salary of 2 junior Soldiers who are still serving.  

The Army, the whole US military, needs to find a way to address these costs namely by drastically reducing them or its going to find itself with no budget left for actual Soldiers.  In another decade or so with this current trend its going to be cutting another 40-50K Soldiers from the active duty service.

Your birth certerficate and one copy

Your German parent's birth certificate and one copy

Your parent's marriage certificate and one copy

Your German grandfather's birth certificate and one copy

Your grandfather's marriage certificate and one copy

Your great grandfather's birth certificate and one copy

Your great grandfathers marriage certificate and one copy

You have to prove your German lineage going back to 1914 or before to establish your citizenship.  

Now you fill out the application, take all of these documents and go to the local embassy or consulate.  Explain what you are there to do and they will send you to speak with the legal team.  They will collect your stuff and send it off to Germany.  The Bundesverwaltungsamt will go over your application with a fine tooth comb.   They will ask for more documents; however, that part varies, so I cannot tell you which documents they will be asking for.  

Now for the worst part.  It takes them YEARS do give you an answer.  I believe the average is around 2 years.  

Once a decision has been made, they will email you the details.  If you are granted citizenship, you have to send the Bundesverwaltungsamt 25 euros for your Staatsangehörigkeitsausweis.  You have to either go through your bank or have a friend in Germany do this for you, as they do not accept cash.

It was always unavoidable that there would be either debt relief or a default, because the debt level is utterly unsustainable.

However, politicians can't sell that to the public right now—if they offer debt relief, their parties will get massacred in the next elections of their respective countries.

What they were hoping for was that a decade of harsh austerity in Greece would be enough to build enough public support for debt relief, and that the decision might even have to be made by parties other than their own.

However, now that Greece has stopped playing along, they appear to have decided that losing all the money and crushing Greece is preferable over eventually recouping ~50% of the money, since the former option lets them place the blame on the Greeks and save themselves from the voters' wrath.

So really, we're about to waste 100+ billion euros on saving politicians the hassle of having to explain to voters that the other half was lost the moment we decided to shield our financial institutions from exposure to bad Greek debt.

Yes, Greece is not building a military and there is a common currency now and that will produce a different outcome. But I am struck by how much it looks like 1923 all over again. I also don't think it's right to ignore history just because there won't be a war.

This point seems to be constantly raised; I'm not sure if it's opaquely trying to point out that a great many people are actually economic migrants (which seems totally valid to me), but I wish that people would just explicitly make the statement.

Early Chinese immigration to the US [did have a lot of men moving over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Chinese_Americans) as well: young men, off to make money:

&gt; Only merchants were able to take their wives and children overseas. The vast majority of Chinese immigrants were peasants, farmers and craftsmen. Young men, who were usually married, left their wives and children behind since they at first had the intention of only staying in America temporarily. Wives also had another major reason for staying behind as they had a traditional role in looking after her parents-in-law. Men sent a large part of the money they earned in America back to China. Because it was usual at that time in China to live in confined social nets of families, unions, and guilds, sometimes whole village communities and even regions (for instance, Taishan) sent nearly all or every of their young men to California.

I've read articles about foreign labor in the oil states in the Middle East, which follows a similar pattern, and I'd guess that that's a not uncommon form of sending labor somewhere.  If I had to guess:

* In many cultures, men are expected to be more-independent than women.

* Historically, though perhaps not of great interest today, men could provide more physical labor.

* Rape is probably more of an issue for women.

* A child couldn't care for themselves.

* The elderly may have a difficult time learning a new language, and I would guess that if someone has been living in an area for some decades, the idea of moving and starting over and throwing out everything that they know would be less-appealing to them.

If you rule out women, children, and the elderly, that kind of narrows it down to favoring young men.

Also, while I don't know about Europe, family reunification is a [major route to citizenship](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/family-reunification) -- two-thirds of it -- in the US.  That is, it's vital to get *one* person in the family citizenship, and that's a vital foothold to bringing over the remaining family.  So it makes the most sense to put the effort into your single best shot.  Marry, have a kid, and then head overseas, sending money back, and try to bring the family over.",null,0,null,1436326248,null,0,1436327007,0,csvt7sc,null,t3_3ch2kz,null,t1_csvt7sc,null,t1_csvh8f1,null,null,null,1437676920,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

&gt; Today's tensions bear far more similarity to the period before World War I
During the Cold War, the comparably matched Western and Soviet blocs prepared for war but also made sure that war never came. They locked Europe in a tense but stable balance of power; that balance is gone. They set clear red lines and vowed to defend them at all costs. Today, those red lines are murky and ill-defined. Neither side is sure where they lie or what really happens if they are crossed. No one can say for sure what would trigger war.

&gt; That is why, analysts will tell you, today's tensions bear far more similarity to the period before World War I: an unstable power balance, belligerence over peripheral conflicts, entangling military commitments, disputes over the future of the European order, and dangerous uncertainty about what actions will and will not force the other party into conflict.

&gt; Today's Russia, once more the strongest nation in Europe and yet weaker than its collective enemies, calls to mind the turn-of-the-century German Empire, which Henry Kissinger described as ""too big for Europe, but too small for the world."" Now, as then, a rising power, propelled by nationalism, is seeking to revise the European order. Now, as then, it believes that through superior cunning, and perhaps even by proving its might, it can force a larger role for itself. Now, as then, the drift toward war is gradual and easy to miss — which is exactly what makes it so dangerous.

&gt; ""And if Germany doesn’t respond to incursions in the Baltics, if France doesn’t respond and it’s just an American operation, then it will lead to the breaking of NATO, is the theory,"" he said. ""That’s the biggest concern.""

&gt; Saideman described a variation on this scenario that I heard from others as well: that Putin might attempt to seize some small sliver of the Baltics quickly and bloodlessly. This would make it politically easier for Western European leaders to do nothing — how to rally your nation to war if hardly anyone has even been killed? — and harder to counterattack, knowing it would require a full-scale invasion.

&gt; ""I think they’re very serious about this,"" Saideman said. ""There’s a real concern.""

It just shows you how bad the sino-soviet relation was, is and will be. Not only did the russians steal land from china, they had work throughout the decades to destabilize china.

""The Peshawar Seven insurgents received military training in neighboring Pakistan and China,""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War


The animosity and competition between china and russia is fascinating and kept quiet/hidden by the media for some reason.


The animosity is also why china didn't develop/urbanize for decades. The chinese feared nuclear attack from the soviet union and spread out it's population rather than centralizing them in cities to avoid mass casualties in a nuclear attack from the soviet union. The Joint Chiefs of Staff's study estimated that china would suffer less losses than the soviet union because of their population distribution and lack of cities.

China only started to modernize/urbanize when it had tacit US support against the soviet union and their own nuclear and ballistic technology was sufficient enough to defend against soviets.

They've actually been running a small primary budget surplus, and without debt payments, they'd be able to more or less get by without additional bailouts.

If you're willing to accept the reality that a bit over half the money isn't coming back, the problem suddenly becomes relatively easy to fix.

Here's a basic outline of how that could be done:

1. Freeze debt payments for the next 3-5 years.

2. Take half the debt, and split it into 10 parts.

3. Create a comprehensive list of needed reforms, sort them by short term to long term, and split the list into 10 reform packages.

4. Offer Greece forgiveness of each part in #2 contingent upon successful implementation of a corresponding reform package in #3, with a timeline for implementation of the packages spanning the next 30 years or so.

Something like this would give Greece some immediate relief to allow its economy to start growing again, it would ensure that any debt relief would only happen after implementation of reforms, and it would give the Greek people the prospect of clear rewards for policy reforms.

The cost would be enormous, but *much* less than the cost of allowing a Grexit to happen—because once Greece leaves the euro, rapid devaluation of the drachma will follow and Greece will never be able to pay anywhere *near* 50% of its current debt.

The thing is: organised greed is stronger than disorganised democracy.!

Think of any possible transaction where someone receives money. The one receiving is the one that writes up the proposal. If you think the convention is retarded, that's fine, but it's there and they are the ones who need the deal not the rest of the EU.

And yes...I am imagining them going line by line in this stuff. It IS highly technical and there's not time to have a lengthy discussion about theory while the banks are collapsing all around. Any agreement is based on a literal written document and it needs to be parsed. Seriously, anyone with any amount of experience with proposals knows this and the Greeks don't contest it either. Even if it's a bad one, you need a document to work with otherwise you are working with nothing.

All of what you said may be fine if it were some long term agreement, not at days to hours from the banks failing.

There were 8 million Greeks and over 100,000 of them died in a civil war. Look at Syria. Does that look nice? It wasn't nice in much smaller Greece either. 

Many more died before that fighting the occupation, which is where the roots of that civil war began, out of the destabilization. 250-300,000+ died from the forced famine that began in 1941. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cert0/germany_deserved_debt_relief_greece_doesnt/csuubxn)

Greece isn't the only demos in EZ. It's not about ""The People"" versus some hazy evil banksters and bureucrats. The troika consists of IMF, ECB (which represents our money) and EC (which represents our peoples). This democracy problem manifests itself in two main aspects:

1) The financial ministers in troika represent 18 demoi. 330ish million people. _Any_ deal with Greece is one that they'll have to go back and sell to their parliaments &amp; people. Greece needs 18 good friends who are willing to stake their political careers just on an attempt to help them, and Greeks' behaviour makes finding those friends exceedingly difficult. Had Greece behaved like an adult – moved forward with reforms in a timely manner, stayed away from the fucking hyperbole – selling any new rescue plan to the other countries would've been easier. It might've even been doable. But as things stand now, for a majority of EZ governments any lenience on Greece equals playing with electoral fire.

2) Spain will have elections this year, Ireland next spring. Were the creditors to grant Greece unconditional (or even conditional) debt relief, all other countries that are going or have gone through hard times to pay off theirs will be understandably miffed. Even if the current governments make it through to the elections, there's a good chance parties will be elected who campaign on the promise to copy SYRIZA's pathos-laden blackmail which by then would be shown to be a viable tactic. We simply couldn't afford that, financially.

Basically, any new, softer deal with Greece has the potential to bring about massive political instability in EU. It's easier for all involved to let them exit the EZ while making that exit as soft as possible.
