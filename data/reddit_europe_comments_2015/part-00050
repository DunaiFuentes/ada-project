null,false,OWKuusinen,FINL,Finland,null,"&gt;Yes they do. It boils down to 1) the amount of workers needed to operate machinery 2) energy costs 3) maintenance 4) quality. If you don't invest then it gets outdated - it simply becomes impossible to compete with other, modern factories. 0 exports. Too expensive.

Sure, if you don't maintain machinery properly they will fail, but that's the case with everything. My point is that properly operated machinery doesn't. We (Finland) still have OPERATING PAPER MACHINERY from **1905** (you remember? That was the year we lost against Japan). It still produces paper cost-effectively in 2015 even while some of the later machines have been dismantled and moved to Argentina. 

&gt;This is what happened in SU (i'm was born in SU, btw). Mainly because they invested too much in so-called big projects, space and military. Everything else suffered.

I think I did say that you prepared too heavily on war and not enough for peace. I meant this.

Incidentally, I'm Finnish and my family has enough stories on Soviet Union as well. I also study sociology and economy. Novgorod/Moscow/Russian Empire/Soviet Union/Russia tends to be brought up rather regularly in school as well. From my handle you might guess that Soviet history is of some interest to me.

&gt;Lazy workers were bad for productivity. Good workers didn't see any point to work hard as well. Overall productivity fell. My parents have told many stories about this phenomena.

This is what happens when unemployment goes below 2 - 3%. The problem you describe was pretty common all over Europe in the 1970s - 1990s and a large reason why right-wing parties today are so fixated in increasing immigration. 

And I did say corruption. A problem that Russia hasn't solved by switching to capitalism.

&gt;Juche is the strategy of a failed state. USSR was on its way to a full juche state too, except for oil, of course. China made their switch way before. Their leadership understood fairly quickly that communism didn't work and made a gradual switch. Formally China is still called 'communist', but it's not true at all.

USSR practiced state capitalism, which is separate from communism. It was called ""communist"" because that was the official aim (which they self-admittedly never reached). This is a bit nit-picky but important in identifying why Soviet Union fell and China didn't; one organisation (politbyro) can never observe the whole society and the economy that lives in it. You have to cut the control into smaller parts either by encouraging co-ops or private enterprise and Soviets weren't willing to do either.

It's for my sake, I like being able to address things point by point.

&gt;Look, all the things you point out are just a bunch of hype. Of course bad things happen, but you're seeing an epidemic in a situation that has always been bad.

It isn't hype. People are *actually* being executed every year because they've been convicted of sorcery or apostasy or adultery. That's not made up, it's actually happening. That's what happens when Islam is the predominant ideology. That isn't ""bad things happening"", it's literally part of their legal system, it's systemic. You can't compare that to anything in America because nothing like that happens in America.

&gt;We can hype up bad things about America JUST as well. Better we fix things at home before we go on a rampage against other cultures that are 1. none of our business, 2. we have so little understanding of.

Islam isn't a real threat to America because the American immigration system wants educated immigrants, so the muslims that *do* come to the US aren't typically very religious. However, it *is* a growing threat in Western Europe. So until you've traveled to areas like Rinkeby, Rosengaard, or the French banlieues, don't tell me that it isn't a big deal. Many of these areas literally look like Saudi Arabia. Women who walk around in areas like these uncovered get harassed like you wouldn't believe.

&gt; 90s were really crazy (in a good sense) period in Poland. Suddenly it seemed like every friend/relative of my parents was running some kind of small business, even as simple, as riding train to Hungary or Russia to buy some clothes/shoes, bring them bag in huge bags and sell on Sunday's market. One family I know of was ""juggling"" three shops at once - wife running games arcade, husband running clothes shop and importing VHS tapes from Germany and selling them to video rentals. My parents were running clothes shop, with mom taking days off while working as nurse to travel to Tuszyn (small city near Łódź where many Vietnam/Chineese people were wholeselling clothes).
Many millionaries were made. Makes me sad I missed the ride as an adult.
10/10 would do political transformation again.

Overall, if I were to use one word to describe that period, it'd be ""euphoria"". While it was a bit though at times ( we had a period of hyperinflation of 600%/year ), finally people felt like they have their fates in their hands (I don't care how cheesy it sounds). A very liberal law regarding creating and operating a business was created ( so-called ""ustawa wilczka"" ), which basically nullified 40-or-so different acts of regulations and basically stated ""everything not explictly prohibited by other acts is allowed while conducting business. Everyone has equal opportunity to start a company."". As a result, around 600k new companies got started in a year. Afterwards, those whose companies failed were hired by those who got successful, as their companies grown and needed more employees. There was a corruption, but it wasn't as blatant one as in Russia or Ukraine - many former UB agents ( basically our own KGB/ secret service) had to find new job ( there's pretty famous line in a movie - ""Where can I find employment if my only work-skill is interrogation"" ) - they often made money off insider information when companies started going public on Warsaw stock exchange, or they started mafia gangs with former coleagues - those quickly started fighting each other over infulence zones.

The UK has run a continual fiscal stimulus through deficit spending by the government. This has provided a boost to the economy, what is known to Keynsian economists as the 'Fiscal Multiplier' - every £ spent results in more that a £ of economic activity. As opposed to this the continental nations have been running a contradictory Fiscal policy of decreasing government spending. 

On the monetary side the Bank of England has run an expansionary policy to support economic growth, in stark contract to the EU central bank whose policies have focused more on controlling inflation. The UK has has consistently lower interest rates (which in theory should boost the supply of money and credit in the economy) together with a policy of quantitative easing, Europe on the other hand has only really seen an expansionary monetary policy since Barroso took over in 2014. 

Thirdly the UK has a far more open labour market than most of the continent. This means that employees in general UK employees have less protections in the workplace (lower redundancy payments etc) and enjoy less generous unemployment benefits when out of work. However just as employees are fired faster in a downturn they are also hired faster when the economy recovers - this (in theory) leads to faster growth when the economy recovers.

I am not talking about your grocery waiting lines. Lobbyists in western nations bribe the officials with a hell of a lot more money than these thug gangsters of old did. The new corruption is not directly visible but it stains everything.


And I don't argue that corruption stems from parliamentary democracy, it is just enormously facilitated by it, the only thing better than a parliament with a few hundred MPs to pay off would be a single dictator and his handful of cronies (which is why capitalism prefers to push people towards fascism). I also think that if your country currently does not have a lot of lobbying, it will soon, as the corporate tax rate over there is one of the lowest in Europe, and once this Russia war thing cools off, Lithuania might become an interesting place for multinationals to expand to, after which of course they'll want to influence the legislation.

That's the sort of attitude that piss me off even more. Your twins are a much more likely to die in a car accident caused by you than by measles they'll not contract in the first place. Will you drive around with them in your car? Because if you plan to do so, you are exposing them to a much higher risk than this virus will ever pose.

&gt;There's a reason there's vaccines for measles, there's a high percentage of complications and one in 5000 infected may die

And there are how many cases annually? 200-300? Let's take an average of the last 10 years and round it up to a 1000. Numbers speak for itself, being afraid of measles is the same irrational fear as dreading a super volcano eruption. There are things you willing expose yourself and your kids to, which are more dangerous to your health and safety. Even the vaccines carry a very negligible risk with them but by looking at the numbers, still a risk. This is no debate whether one should get vaccinated, that is self explanatory but about risk reduction/prevention and correct behaviour towards actual risks.

Just by living in a bigger city the air population rate puts you at an increased risk for all sorts of allergies and complications, yet I doubt you thought about moving to the countryside, or did you now? Assess the situation rationally, life itself is a risk, if we were to lose our shit on every occasion, we might as well tear down staircases due to the thousands of deaths annually.

&gt; A tendency in US media to inflate certain topics does not invalidate the very serious fact that immunisation levels are down in the US, in the UK, and also Germany, and that that is a serious and completely unnessessary issue.

Yes, thanks to hysterical knee-jerk reactions of the sort I try to avoid, anti-vaxers even exist and keep spreading.

&gt;Measles could be exstinct by now if not for idiots who think immunisations are unnecessary or cause autism or whatnot.

No it could not, the world is still big and many places do not have direct access to vaccines, there are even countries on our blue planet, which have a less than 50% vaccination rate. Globally it won't go extinct for a long time to come unless resources and time are committed to the true hotspots. Again, nothing that concerns us really in the formate the media is portraying it.

In der Kommunikation zwischen Mitarbeitern der Sendung, die zahlreiche TV-Ausschnitte sichten, und den Autoren der Sendung ist für einen Filmbeitrag die entscheidende Information verloren gegangen, dass eine dort gezeigte Frau keineswegs ihre eigene Meinung äußert, sondern die Meinung anderer. Dadurch wurde sie fälschlicherweise als politisch rechtsstehend dargestellt. Moderator Oliver Welke hat sich nach Bekanntwerden des Fehlers umgehend mit der Frau in Verbindung gesetzt und sich entschuldigt. Die Redaktion wird in der kommenden Ausgabe der heute Show am 13. Februar den Sachverhalt noch einmal aufgreifen und richtig stellen.

&gt; My point here is this: What Putin does right now is something all global powers (or those who want to be a global power) have done for decades. Putin's actions aren't any less moral than when the West has done the exact same shit.
But of course you disagree, because you benefited when our leaders did this shit. So why question all the spoils that you personally (albeit indirectly) benefited from.
No no, let's get all upset, let's forget that the West heavily intervened in the Ukraine first, that what is happening there now is as much of the West's making as it is of Putin's.
The West is always innocent, always only doing things for good. We are so enlightened we would never go to war or support a war anywhere unless it was for purely moralistic reasons.
It's actually pretty sad how people like you accuse me of ""shilling"" and similar things when all you can do is repeat the stuff you're being fed without one bit of self-reflection.
But hey, keep downvoting. If you hit that mouse button hard enough all of this will go away and you can sleep sound tonight in your bed, knowing you've done the moral thing.

Our Estonian flag is supposed to unite all Estonians. LGBT flag has the same goal - a sort of ""you are not alone"" sign. Heterosexuality does not need to promote this, because heterosexuality (family roles, traditional values, heritage) is -default- in our society and for very obvious and biological reasons. Straight people (especially children) don't have to ""come out of the closet"" (which is a painful task for most, by the way), they don't have to go through a process of isolation. Mainstream media does not cater to minority groups. To be blunt, *nothing* mainstream caters to minority groups. Everything gay people demand, straight people already have. You don't feel shame for being straight? You have no reason to. Nobody is going to shame you for wanting to spend your life with a woman. And yet in the times we live in, plenty of people are willing to shame a man who wishes to live with a man. Some people are even willing to kill for it. I was (and still am) suicidal because of my sexuality, but when I see an openly gay celebrity or person of power, it gives me slight hope - that I am worth just as much as my cis friend. As a human being. Does this answer your question?

And believe me, not all gays want to stand out. Some do, some don't. (Though I'm willing to bet most don't) We are not a certain ""species"" of human. Our needs are the same as yours - although not all of them are fulfilled (marriage, for example).

SD only has controversial roots. Their politics is just the average politics except for their views on islam and immigration.

&gt; I might have an overly-simplistic view of Swedish politics, so take my accusation of SD of racism with a grain of salt.

SD is the only party you can vote for if you disagree with the current immigration. Any other party will say that they want to keep and maybe raise current levels.

After SD got around 13% in the election, all of the other parties in the riksdag formed an agreement that they would not vote no for eachothers budget (liberals, moderates and lefties came to this agreement) which was in favour of the red-greens. It's highly unusual that parties who are opposite in politics form agreements like this and it was purely to shut out SD influence. The only party who said ""well maybe we should start discussing this"" was KD.

It's quite easy for a foreigner to understand why SD is on the rise. Sweden has very liberal laws and the riksdag wants Sweden to be a ""humanitarian superpower"". There has even been discussions on wether the Swedish state should even exist and that ""the Swedish culture is in no way superior of any other culture"".",null,0,null,1423348285,null,0,false,0,coeful2,null,t3_2v3zxw,null,t1_coeful2,null,t1_coefh5f,null,null,null,null,null,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9,null

Non sono particolarmente felice di questa decisione. Sì, ci sono dei vantaggi. Mi piace quello che faccio. Ma avrei preferito essere una dipendente che una libera professionista. Lavoro, l'ho già detto, nel settore del web-marketing dove la partita iva è praticamente obbligatoria. Non c'è una concorrenza spietata nel mio settore, ma c'è un problema di fondo. 

Le agenzie di comunicazioni hanno dei costi alti di gestione, per cui hanno dei prezzi troppo alti per i business che a loro si rivolgono. I business quindi si rivolgono spesso ai freelance come me. Ovviamente le agenzie e i freelance offrono cose diverse, ma per le PMI il freelance basta e avanza nella maggior parte dei casi. 

Senza il regime dei minimi non so cosa avrei fatto sinceramente. Una partita iva ""normale"" non avrei mai potuto reggerla ed è già stato difficile reggere la partita dei minimi, ho avuto bisogno dell'aiuto dei miei per pagare le tasse del primo anno anche se la mole di lavoro e guadagni è aumentata (ma le tasse del primo anno sono sostanzialmente doppie, perché paghi le tasse del primo anno e l'anticipo del secondo). 

Parliamo anche dalla soglia da 15mila euro, che significa un guadagno, tolte le spese, di 1250 euro al mese, una cifra onesta se non consideri che circa 400 euro se ne vanno di tasse tra imps e sostitutiva. Con 30.000 euro al mese arrivi a 2500 euro al mese e le tasse, sempre ai minimi, arrivano a circa 820 euro. 30.000 Euro all'anno con la partita iva agevolata significa in sostanza uno stipendio di 1600 euro al mese. Non sono cifre alte, queste. Se la partita iva agevolata vecchia era conveniente, immagina cosa significa pagare le tasse ""normali"" su 18.000/20.000/25.000 euro. Quanto ti resta in tasca? Come riesci a viverci? 

Detto questo, non sto dicendo che non ci siano approfittatori, anzi... in edilizia moltissimi sono i datori di lavoro hanno obbligato i loro dipendenti a fare la partita iva per esempio.

You've gone completely off topic here, my post was about why **Ukrainians** have volunteered, not why people from other countries would want them too. Quite frankly, people from other countries making value judgements (like you right now) about Ukrainians' reasons for signing up to fight against Russia are irrelevant.

No shit
&gt; If you can't win the war, then you should stop the killing. There's always an abundance of patriotic spirit in situations like this, but this is also the kind of situation where the government is expected to do the responsible thing.

One of the stupidest things I've read in a long time. You are literally using racist terminology to defend yourself against accusations of racism, talking about the caucasoid race.

I think they should concede the territory that is already lost and far beyond their reach and ability to reclaim. I'm pretty sure that they'll eventually be told to agree to that by EU/NATO anyway.

I believed you have confused 2 seperate interest rates in your reponse to my paragraph on monetary policy. 

When you refer to 10y rates being higher than the EU I assume you are referring to the yields on 10 year government debt? If so then you are accurate, rates in Europe are indeed higher than in the UK - this is not however the rate which concerns monetary policy, it is a more accurate reflection, as you stated, of the creditworthiness of the government in question and the alternative investment opportunities. 

When referring to monetary policy the interest rate in question is the bank of England base rate - the rate at which the UK central bank will provide interest on reserves held by banks. By lowering the return on holding reserves the BofE encourages banks to instead lend this money out - which in theory should boost credit in the economy and therefore economic growth. In comparison in the Eurozone the central bank actually increased interest rates at the start of the crisis - tightening credit in the EU, acting as a contraction on economic growth.

I love that picture. Most of the interpretations I read talk about ""Goya worried about getting old"" and such (Saturn = God of the time) but I have a different interpretation considering the context of the painting.

The Saturn myth is about an old god devouring his sons to keep the ""status quo"". Goya's picture was painted around 1823, when the Liberal Spain was crushed by the French Intervention Army (""the 100k sons of Saint Luis"") and the Absolutist regime come back, harder than ever. Liberals were repressed, imprisoned or killed (the Spanish National Police was created those days to prosecute the liberals) and a lot of them were intellectuals or artists. The ""old Spain"" was *devouring* their sons to keep the status quo, just like Saturn.

&gt;One of the stupidest things I've read in a long time. You are literally using racist terminology to defend yourself against accusations of racism, talking about the caucasoid race. Thinking badly of people because of the colour of the skin falls under the definition of racism whether or not you consider them to be part of the ""white race (caucasian)"" or not.

1. Caucasian isn't a racist terminology http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian It's simply an implication of where your ancestors are from. Not racist in the slightest no matter how much you'd like it to be. 

2. I never spoke badly about anyone. Please do copy paste anything that was derogatory towards a set people of the public in which I thought my own group of people where superior to (literally the definition of racism)  in my previous comment. 

&gt;By the way, it's the vast Majority, not a vast majority, since ""a vast majority"" implies that there are other majorities out there, which logically incoherent.

Ti spiego il mio punto di vista: questi organi non hanno alcun potere sull'uso quotidiano che fa la gente della sua lingua. Al massimo, possono influenzare la lingua tecnica usata al governo o in ambito di lavoro, ed anche lì, le raccomandazioni ""ufficiali"" vengono poco spesso seguite. 

Non vedo alcun problema con l'articolo della Crusca riguardo scannerizzare/scandire, veramente. Questo tipo di cose succede su una base quotidiana anche qui in Québec, dove di solito l'organo che regola la lingua è molto duro con gli inglesismi e cerca di dargli una traduzione formata su basi francesi quando possibile. A volte è veramente l'uso a dover decidere e non c'è raccomandazione che possa cambiarlo. 

Che ""scannerizzare"" sembri un barbarismo ad alcuni, lo posso capire. Ma i dibattiti che si hanno sulle parole spesso sono vani, dato che poi è l'uso che ha potere di vita o di morte sulle parole.  

In verità, tutte le parole nella lista dell'articolo della Crusca mi sembrano formate perfettamente, sebbene alcune siano orribili secondo me (ma ciò non importa, specie perché non sono italiano):

&gt; scandire, scannare, scannerare, scannerizzare, e anche eseguire una scansione (e scansionare)

Non mi pare che ci sia alcun ragionamento etimologico che possa farne vincere una sulle altre. Secondo me, un organo che regola la lingua può al massimo fare proposte construttive per rimpiazzare un termine giudicato ""brutto"" o inutilmente preso in prestito da un'altra lingua, ma non serve che vada in guerra contro i prestiti oppure non finisce mai. 

Comunque concordo sulla maggior parte di quello che dici... Non vedo cosa ci sia di male a proporre delle regole e a seguirle, e ciò avverrebbe in una vita ideale, ma spesso ognuno fa quello che gli pare (ed è sempre stato così, direi), basandosi più volentieri su motivi di moda che su motivi (seppur validi) etimologici per scegliere una parola invece di un'altra.",null,0,null,1423352051,null,0,false,0,coehmfs,null,t3_2uzudy,null,t1_coehmfs,null,t1_coe6479,null,null,null,null,null,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2,null

Catholic Schools are where you go prior to university.

These schools all teach religion but some are more religious than others.Many have nuns teaching at them although less so than they did historically, some have priests teaching (mainly all-boys schools). Catholic schools are fairly Catholic, I remember learning the rosary in first and second grade and they wrap Catholic milestones like First Communion into normal lessons. Non-Catholics go to these schools too (I guess you could say they're also very catholic, haha), often because they're better than local public schools (funded by the local parish), when I went to one we had several Jewish students in my grade who went to all the classes and just sat in the back during church and didn't pray with us, it was fine. Most are free to attend for Catholics from that parish, my parents paid but we were from a different parish.

Church-affiliated universities are a different beast. Some are still strictly religious but most, including pretty much all the big and famous ones (Notre Dame, Georgetown, BC, etc) are fairly a-religious in day-to-day life, with optional religious classes and churches on the grounds that don't have mandatory attendance (any more).

This is why Germany had to bail them out. Greece now has to take a hit for the whole of the EU. Its not nice but this is the price they have to pay for membership.

Only 8% say most people in Hungary are better off, and 16% say things are about the same. In no other Central or Eastern European country surveyed did so many believe that economic life is worse now than during the communist era. This is the result of almost universal displeasure with the economy. Fully 94% describe the country's economy as bad, the highest level of economic discontent in the hard hit region of Central and Eastern Europe. Just 46% of Hungarians approve of their country's switch from a state-controlled economy to a market economy; 42% disapprove of the move away from communism. The public is even more negative toward Hungary's integration into Europe; 71% say their country has been weakened by the process.

    Anti-immigration movements that I see in Europe, over which there seems to be a lot of concern, may be a bad idea, but they also don't appear to be particularly violent, certainly aren't associated with the Third Reich movement, and I certainly would not use the term ""Nazi"" to refer to them.

* How much people care about gypsies.  My view was that they were kinda colorful, but if someone said ""gypsy"", I'd think of someone with a crystal ball fortunetelling, dancing, Renaissance faires...and nothing particularly-modern.

Riporto il pensiero di Luca Fiorentino su Facebook, perché mi rappresenta abbastanza bene (dialetto napoletano incluso):

""italiano medio.
[pericolo spoiler]

il pubblico all'anteprima del film di maccio capatonda era come se alla proiezione del padrino ci fossero stati veramente i mafiosi coi popcorni, o a quella dell'esercito delle dodici scimmie la sala fosse stata occupata da na dozzina di macachi.

comitive di ingegneri senza alcuna speranza di chiavare, ovunque.
il riso partiva incontrollato già alla sola vista di ""scritto da bruno liegi bastonliegi"" nei titoli d'apertura.

non ti dico poi quando maccio andava a sbattere nella macchina da presa e ruciuliava a terra.
ahahahahahahahahahahah
ahahhahahahahahah
ahaahahahahahahahahah
ahahahhahah.

al di là di alcune scelte slapstick inutili - che però so state quelle che hanno coinvolto maggiormente il pubblico di italiani medi in sala, assieme a quei suuuca ripetuti fino alla noia. 
al di là di escamotage comici come i piriti a bomba, e di una fotografia non sempre perfetta, sto film tiene na coerenza di fondo che m'è piaciuta.
così come le prove monumentali di rupert sciamenna e herbert ballerina, vere e proprie facce di plastilina - finalmente un po' di bruttezza come si deve nel cinema italiano.

dicevo, un film paradossalmente coerente, prima di tutto perché non demonizza esclusivamente il troglodita, ma anche il fanatico ambientalista vegano.

e poi perché lo spiegone finale sul compromesso è una bella istantanea dell'italia contemporanea.
quella dei due piedi in una scarpa, dei linguaggi democristianamente edulcorati (scopare che diventa magicamente copulare).

cioè affinale non si salva nessuno, neppure maccio, che fa un film e se lo fa distribuire da medusa, società per azioni controllata dal gruppo mediaset.

compromesso che dopo anni di video spesso geniali buttati su youtube, dove la gente gode del tuo operato ma non caccia na lira, forse inizi a pensare che pure salire sul cavallo del cavaliere sia necessario per andare avanti.
nossacc.

piccola nota romantica.
una delle scene migliori, quando i protagonisti stanno pianificando l'ingresso nel palazzo del cattivone, è sottolineata da un pezzo dei silicon dust, produttori di musica elettronica napulegni, amici-quasi-fratelli, bell uagliù.

e quindi chestè.
andatelo a vedere.
magari non all'anteprima in un multisala pieno di abbonati che mò ripeteranno per un mese il refrain scopare.
co la tristezza nel cuore però, perché devono tornare solo in montenegro o in lituania per vedere n'altra volta la fessa.

Every country in Europe could make the same claims. And yet you'll find very different policies regarding immigration and religious communities. 

In the UK, there is also no political party that endorses the idea of radical Islam, and there's mosques that preach the stuff being ousted by the media. And yet you have Cameron now saying they utterly failed. 

&gt; No, it's not semantics. Integration and assimilation are two very different concepts. You are as confused as all the Pegida members.

Me? I'm the one confused? 

From the report I linked you to, page 14, on the Swedish Left Party:

&gt; The Party maintains a policy of multiculturalism rather than Integration (which it argues risks appearing racist) and has calls for increased interaction between communities (V 2013a). 

page 17, Red Green Alliance, 

&gt; strongly criticises SF’s use of an integrationist discourse in recent years (Rohleder interview) and is careful to avoid language that may problematise immigration.

But indeed I see the term assimilation being used too. As I said, semantics... we can call it assimilation if you prefer, it's irrelevant to me.

They thus sought an alliance with the party that was more likely to allow them to carry out that mandate rather than make concessions in areas their electorate would see as essential. In this they contributed to more accurately represent their government as an extension of the people's will at the time of the election.

Fact number 2: Greece's veto was because they had not been consulted in the decision which required unanimity between member states.

Vladimir Putin is no saint by any stretch of the imagination, that much is clear. But what objective evidence do we have to suggest Petro Poroshenko is anything more than another opportunistic politician, just like his Russian counterpart? 

According to linked stories on the Ukrainian president's Wikipedia page:
'In 2006, John Herbst, US Ambassador to Ukraine, described Poroshenko as a ""disgraced oligarch."" Later that same year Sheila Gwaltney, Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassy in Ukraine, said that ""Poroshenko was tainted by credible corruption allegations."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro_Poroshenko#Cultural_and_political_image

Both sides are sucking the world dry into a new cold war that runs dangerously risky of turning hot. I'd guess the Russian and American governments (and their regional puppets now at play in Ukraine) both saw benefits to having each country's general populations viewing the other as a nemesis once again after 25 years without a Berlin Wall dividing Europe.

Of course Cameron is being populist and there are no problems. There are never any problems. Hence why Pegida is growing. 

&gt; I don't know much about Sweden's left party but integration and multiculturalism aren't mutually exclusive. 

This wasn't about Sweden. That report is by British universities and they use the term ""integration"". But again, this is just non-fixed semantics.  

Some use integration to mean assimilation, to others multiculturalism is integration, others distinguish the three terms, it's a mess. Regardless, this is about how much should they conform to our norms, and how much should our society adapt itself to them. 

&gt; I am still not any wiser in regards to what Pegida wants, what they don't like and what they specifically want to change. 

I am not an expert on Pegida, but they seem to want for instance, decentralized housing of refugees, which I believe to be of utter most importance.

They also want a  decrease in the number of asylum seekers per social worker which supposedly currently is 200:1. A metric which I believe makes sense. It's a good indicator of whether you're taking more immigrants than you can deal with. 

They oppose parallel paralegal justice systems, like the ones  in the UK, which is a perfectly sensible stance.

Yeah I know that case well. US courts will look to British courts as well for issues that have not been litigated yet in the US or very little litigation has occurred. 

One thing I wish UK courts would do would be to modernize the language they write their opinions in. I forgot what the case was, but I remember reading a case from the early 2000s that sounded like it was from the early 1600s. You will find stale and overly formal language in US cases as well but the trend is moving away from it. The UK seems like it has not embraced that yet. 

Is all British contract law Common Law, or have they codified large sections? For instance here the Uniform Commercial Code governs sale of goods contracts for the most part and especially as it relates to merchants. So it is kind of like having civil law for goods and common law for services. A bit odd but the distinction was intentional in that it figured standardizing goods contracts, especially between merchants, was easier than services contracts because personal services can not be substituted as easily.

IMF is the lender of last resort to countries that are unable to convince other countries to bail them out or no longer want to borrow from international markets.

I say unable to convince other countries because there was a case that the US under Bill Clinton gave mexico a bailout on generous terms in 1995 because he knew by doing so he could get the mexican-american vote in 1996.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Debt_Disclosure_Act_of_1995


But in most other cases, When your the beggar you obviously don't have a lot of options.

A lot of the cases most of the countries that have went to the IMF/WB for a bailout were economies that were already on in the middle of recession like latin america in the 1980's. or the Asian tiger countries in 1997.

When OPEC raised oil prices in 1973 it devastated a lot of global economies, and in this particular case. Latin America. Latin america then decided to borrow from international creditors, ironically the international creditors got a lot of the money they then used to loan from america, from the OPEC countries since a lot of the money they got they didn't know what to do with it so they parked it in western banks. Most of the Latin American economies then used it for social welfare, state owned industries. Basically to boost their economy. Although inflation would persist due to the oil price rise in 1973. However once the 1979 oil crisis occurred due to the Iranian revolution and oil prices went up even more, Inflation in latin america went up and devastated their economies until they decided to borrow again from international creditors to boost their economies and use that money for spending. Then by 1981-1982. Many Western countries went into recession as the central banks of those western countries raised interest rates to counter high inflation that happened due to the iranian revolution. As Western countries went into recession. Latin america was hit hard as commodities which were their main export even to this day. The demand for their commodities dropped massively. And even though the western countries went back into positive growth by 1983-1984. 

The Latin american countries after having a roller-coaster ride since 1973. Decided to turn to the IMF as their economies were on the brink and they defaulted on the loans they owed to foreign creditors that they had been borrowing for a decade. the IMF gave them billions in bailouts and then asked the latin american countries to cut government spending as a lot of the loans went towards funding government spending and the high spending was contributing to rising debt as the latin americans needed more debt/borrowing to fund that spending. And Obviously the poorer residents get hit hard even though a lot of that spending was financed and was unsustainable. 


So instead of looking it through, IMF told my government to do this ----&gt; I'm poor!!! ---&gt; Its the IMF's fault!!!!


The way you should of seen it is.

My Government was borrowing and creating illusionary growth based on debt----&gt; My government defaults/no longer trusted by the creditors they were borrowing from------&gt; Government turns to the international lender of last resort------&gt;International lender of last resort AKA: IMF tells government that their spending was unsustainable-----&gt;Government spending cut--------&gt;I get less or no social welfare money from the government because it was bound to happen anyway.




&gt;  it describes the effect the free market terms of an IMF/WB intervention have on the poor part of society, namely you can set your clock to riots due to high prices on basic goods breaking out

High Prices on basic goods occurs because those countries devalue their currency but sometimes inflation increases more then they thought it would.



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Argentina

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigazo

&gt;The main measures were

&gt;A 150% devaluation of currency for the commercial exchange rate



Which led to this in 1976 in argentina.


http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/argentina-inflation-cpi.png?s=arcpiyoy&amp;d1=19440101&amp;d2=19871231


Meanwhile the IMF only bailed out argentina in 1984 so they were no where in sight when the first hyperinflation in that country started in 1976.


And even by then another round of hyperinflation in Argentina was already in process 1982.

it started in 1982 Mainly because of mexico defaulting on its loans which caused all other latin american countries to default.

Well, I get the idea that DART has a large bus network by looking at the [DART system map](http://dart.org/maps/systemmap.asp).  Also from having ridden DART.  The fact that DART's light rail system is the [largest in the U.S. is well-known](http://www.houstontomorrow.org/livability/story/dallas-green-line-begins-service/).

&gt; I live in Dallas right now and I can tell you that public transportation in Dallas is NON-EXISTENT.

Do you live in the actual city or do you live in a suburb?  Suburban service is so small as to be nonexistent unless you're in an inner-ring one like Addison or Richardson.  I can assure you that DART public transportation exists *and* that it can be done to live in the DART service without a car.  I have done it.  Most suburbs didn't join DART when it started and now lack the taxing ability to join it.  You can thank the Texas legislature for that.

&gt; Also, there is ONE, count 'em, ONE train that goes from Fort Worth to Dallas. One.

Correct, that's the Trinity Railway Express (it's heavy rail, not light rail) and most of the distance covered by the TRE is outside of DART's tax and service area.  You can also thank the Texas legislature for that one.

&gt; I got to see Seattle. Please. Please. The United States and its public transportation system is Non-Existent.

OK, now you've slagged on the *second* system which I personally know.  Seattle's bus system is much better than Dallas' and it is even *more* possible to live in Seattle without a car (the weather is better; it never hits 100F in Seattle).

I get that you're pissed, and I get that the United States has room for a **lot** of improvement, but crapping on that which does exist does a major disservice to transit operators and transit advocates in the areas which are trying to improve from ""fair/OK"" to ""great.""

QE lets an economy grow by injecting cash into the economy.
Normally cash is injected into an economy by consumers and businesses taking out loans. Private banks create fresh money when you take a loan through fractional reserve banking.
When that process stops, the central bank can take over with QE.

A side-effect could be currency depreciation, but that is not the main intention. Indeed, the dollar is soaring even though QE is still ongoing there.

The Euro has mainly fallen due to lack of faith in the currency.

Suppose running a 3% deficit allows you to grow with 1% more per year. Assume the government taxes 50% of GDP.

3% deficit will mean you're borrowing 1.5% of GDP. Current interest rate for a 2 year Gilt is 0.43%. So you're going to pay 1.5% * 0.43% in interest, or about 0.0000645% of GDP in interest payments.

You're economy grew an extra 1% (it is forever 1% bigger than it would have been if you did not take the loan), so you got 0.5% of GDP in extra revenue.

Eventually you might want to pay back the principle. But stable governments pay so little interest that it makes more sense to just keep the debt and let inflation and GDP growth increase the size of your economy -&gt; the debt shrinks relative to it.

Or, the millions of pounds of debt the UK government incurred in the 1800s are laughable now - though they were significant sums of money back then and allowed the UK to become the empire it was.


And the reason it works is CAPITALISM.

The government borrows at extremely low rates, in their own currency, so they will never have trouble repaying it.

The private sector generally pays much more interest than the government when it loans money. But because the government loaned this money, the private sector was taxed 3% less than it otherwise would have been. Moreover, the borrowed money didn't vanish: the government spent it and ultimately some Brit received the money as his salary and spent it again. Rinse and repeat.
That is how the borrowed money allowed the economy to grow an additional 1%. This is called the multiplier in Keynesian economics.

The Brits have known this since the 1800s and Keynes formalized it in the 1930s.

Had the government instead taxed the private sector, then the private sector would either (a) not invest or (b) take out loans at higher interest rates to invest (much higher than the 0.43% the government pays).",null,0,null,1423373146,null,0,1423373706,0,coer1jm,null,t3_2v47px,null,t1_coer1jm,null,t1_coehne4,null,null,null,null,null,20,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,20,null

&gt;Kolomyski has used Privat's ""quasi-military forces"" to enforce hostile takeovers of companies, sending a team of ""hired rowdies armed with baseball bats, iron bars, gas and rubber bullet pistols and chainsaws"" to forcibly take over a Kremenchuk steel plant in 2006,[24] and has used ""a mix of phony court orders (often involving corrupt judges and/or registrars) and strong-arm tactics"" to replace directors on the boards of companies he purchases stakes in.[25] Kolomyski was criticized by Mr Justice Mann in a court case in London involving an attempted hostile takeover of an oil company, with the judge stating that Kolomyski had ""a reputation of having sought to take control of a company at gunpoint in Ukraine"" and that there were ""strong grounds for doubting the honesty of Mr Kolomoisky"".[26]

Ukraine after the ""revolution of dignity""- an impoverished kleptocracy mired in civil war and controlled entirely by organized crime- is a lot more similar to Uganda, Sierra Leone, and Zimbabwe than to any European country.

And there is no way that such demands and the choice of words are just lip-services, even when these demands come from people who view refugees as ""Untermenschen"", right? I'm sure that the people who were marching in Saxony or who were declaring a ""historic holy war on all Turks and Muslims"" (does that sound familiar to anyone, like ""Islamist familiar""?) in the streets of my city care deeply about the well-being of refugees.

There are problems with our refugee policies, but you don't have to follow fascists and or turn into one to address these problems!



&gt;That there is a problem with your immigration, that's obvious when you have estimates of 1,800 German Muslims going to Syria to join ISIS. 

Germany has almost twenty million people with a migration background. When 1,800 of them chose to join ISIS (most of them are second or third generation Germans or even converts from well integrated families), we don't have an immigration problem but a problem with a small of group of people.

Interview with an American photographer in Eastern Ukraine:

&gt;It’s kind of strange, because in the last five days of the bombing and shelling, we haven’t seen a single militia compound that has actually been hit. **Every building that we’ve seen been hit by the Ukrainian mortars have been civilian buildings. We personally seen at least over 40 different civilian buildings bombed, that includes a school, an orphanage – we were in an orphanage the day before yesterday that was hit – and the very many large apartment buildings, like the very big apartment buildings have been hit** . Some of the apartment buildings – it’s not like the Ukrainian army miss-aimed or something like this – the same buildings when they are bombed, they hit them very hard. We spoke to one woman who said that in the night a few days ago her apartment building was hit with ten different mortars.

&gt;V: Do you think they are targeting civilian buildings on purpose?

&gt;P: Well, if they are not targeting the civilian buildings, then I can’t see how incompetent someone can be as a military force or battalion. If they are not actually targeting the civilians…They are only hitting the civilians! Then it would be children playing with the mortars. I mean, children could possibly aim better than this, because they are not hitting any military buildings, **they are just hitting the civilians.**

I'm not trying to be offensive and probably are putting things in more Black/white perspective, though there are lot of shades of gray in reality. And I might get some details wrong.

Lot of ""old"" Europe has strong anti-US sentiment and perverted (in my opinion) liberalism where everything ""conservative-like"" is considered to be bad. Think about something like hippies turned hipsters. They maybe ain't  pro-russian, but ""evil empire USA is using Europe as a proxy in their war with Russia"".

Then there are parts of Europe who have very strong Russian ties (e.g. Serbia) who mosty foster pro-Russian feelings there.

So far I see that Southern Europe is playing very strange. But it mostly seems they are pretending to be more pro-Russian just to rub EU's nose. Also you have to pay attention that they have strong unemployment problems and people in that situation tend to admire ""strong leaders, like Putin"".

Ce sont les socialistes qui nous collent systématiquement cette étiquette.

Je le répète, la culture existait avant l'État et existera après.

Les dessins des grottes préhistoriques n'étaient pas financés par l'impôt. Les chansons traditionnelles irlandaises non plus. Pas plus que les solos de guitare de Led Zeppelin.

Les monuments, parcs, etc. peuvent bien évidemment être entretenus sans passer par l'État, par des fondations, des associations, etc. C'est déjà bien souvent le cas d'ailleurs.

Encore une fois, l'État n'a rien inventé. Pas la médecine, pas l'éducation, les routes ou les hôpitaux. Tout cela existait avant, et continuera d'exister après l'État-nation.

L'État a juste obtenu un monopole dans de nombreux domaines. Mais c'est un système qui fonctionne assez mal, puisque géré par des politiciens motivés par un intérêt a court terme (le ministre qui reste un an et demi a l'environnement se fiche pas mal du futur de la planète ; il cherchera simplement a satisfaire l'opinion publique en fonction du consensus présent, afin de préparer une transition vers un meilleur ministère).",null,0,null,1423385290,null,0,false,0,coeuqjy,null,t3_2v4o8e,null,t1_coeuqjy,null,t1_coeuko2,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1,null

Anzi diciamola tutta: per restare nei 30K€ l'anno devi rinunciare a qualche cliente o posticipare fatture o lavorare che so, 3 giorni alla settimana, insomma un affarone!

Il mercato è ""drogato"" a causa di questo: il cliente si rivolge a te e non alla pmi perché tu costi meno, come puoi pretendere che la pmi vada in giro ad assumere dipendenti se il cliente non va da loro? Da questo il mancato dipendente decide di aprire partita iva, col regime dei minimi; risultato? un altro concorrente ""sleale"" in più.

Ma prima o poi capita il patatrack, precisamente a 35 anni, o a 35+5 anni: finisce il rdm e a quel punto le tasse schizzano su; che fai? Cambi le tariffe e il tuo cliente ti guarda e dice ""ma secondo te perche' devo rimanere con te che mi hai raddoppiato le tariffe?"" e piglia e se ne va da un altro freelance..col regime dei minimi.

Risultato: hai tra i 35 o 40 anni, una partita iva, l'acconto iva e irpef dell'anno nuovo da pagare e non hai più clienti.

Questo è quello che era in essere fino a ieri, che il governo ha cambiato e che ACTA vorrebbe rimettere.

Ora parliamo invece del nuovo regime dei minimi, però guardiamolo dal punto di vista giusto: serve per chi fa un secondo lavoro o per chi ha appena iniziato . Ovvio che con 15k€ non ci vivi ma l'idea infatti è che tu non ci debba vivere con quei soldi, quello sia unicamente il periodo iniziale per permetterti di ""carburare"" e fare clienti. si parla di agevolazione, di stato temporaneo, una volta che sei partito in un anno vedi se il tuo progetto imprenditoriale funziona oppure no, e nel caso non funzioni non ti ritrovi a fare debiti per pagare le tasse. 

Se il mercato ritorna realmente competitivo puoi chiudere la partita iva e andare a fare il dipendente perché le aziende possono e vogliono assumere. protestare per tornare al vecchio rdm vuol dire far rimanere il mercato drogato di oggi, con te scontento perché volevi un tempo ind. l'azienda scontenta perché non trova clienti e una generazione di disoccupati ma con età &gt;35-40 anni.

* Stuttgart (unless you enjoy looking at cars in museums). I'll never understand why so many foreigners seem to want to visit it.
* Düsseldorf. I think the problem here is that it turns up in lists of ""top 10 most visited places in Germany"", so tourists think it's something special; but the visitors are actually going there for the trade fair.
* Cologne. The cathedral is massive, there's no doubt about that. But that's all Cologne really has to offer. Samuel Taylor Coleridge once wrote: ""The river Rhine, it is well known, / Doth wash your city of Cologne. / But tell me, nymphs, what power divine / Shall henceforth wash the river Rhine?"" Cologne cathedral is actually only the second tallest in Germany: if you want to see the tallest, you need to go to Ulm, which is by far a much more pleasant city.
* Garmisch-Partenkirchen, especially out of season and especially if you don't ski. The only reason you would go there would be to go somewhere else, namely the Zugspitze.
* Frankfurt am Main. The historic centre -- what's left of it after centuries of first urban redevelopment and then war -- is tiny and full of construction sites at the moment; Frankfurt is Germany's financial capital and so is most famous for having a couple dozen skyscrapers.

Merci la gauche. 

&gt;Le régime de Vichy a établi une discrimination entre homosexualité et hétérosexualité : une loi signée par Pétain le 6 août 1942 fixait en effet un âge plus élevé pour la répression des « actes impudiques ou contre nature [commis] avec un mineur de son sexe ».

&gt;La discrimination n’a pas été supprimée à la Libération. En 1945, la “majorité sexuelle” pour des relations hétérosexuelles est passée à quinze ans, tandis que la majorité homosexuelle demeurait fixée à 21 ans – avant d’être abaissée à dix-huit ans en 1974 avec l’âge de la majorité civile. [1]

&gt;C’est l’arrivée de la gauche au pouvoir en 1981 qui a permis de faire cesser cette discrimination, grâce à l’adoption de la loi n° 82-683 du 4 août 1982

###**Iraqi Prime Minister al-Abadi pleads for help in Berlin to fight IS**
- Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi believes that IS can be defeated within this year if the international community helps Iraq to fight IS. Al-Abadi believes that
Iraq will not be able to win a war of attrition, especially since IS is recruiting internationally. The prime minister pleads for high-tech equipment for the
Iraqi military as well as the Peshmerga. The further demanded, that not only the Peshmerga werde provided with weapons by Germany, but also the central government 
in Bagdad. He further mentioned that he would welcome German airstrikes as well. He also hopes for business from other countries as he fears that high unemployment

###**Merkel reprimands Orbán about press freedom during visit in Hungary**
- Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that even a government with a large majority must value the the opposition, civil society and the freedom of press.
Merkel also noted that the word illiberal and democracy do not go together in her understanding. This was a direct respond to an earlier statement by 
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán that ""an illiberal democracy is a model for Hungary. We do not believe that every democracy is necessarily liberal"". Orbán's 
government increased its control over the justice system and the press over the past years which was strongly criticised by other European Governments.
Despite the rebuke by Merkel Orbán thanked her as German companies help Hungary to reach one of the highest employment rates in the last years. According 
to Orbán German companies created 300000 jobs in the last years and export to Germany reached an export high of of 21 billion euro.

###**The federal government advises US against delivering arms to Ukraine and spoke out against delivering weapons themselves**
- SPD Foreign policy speaker Niels Annen^1  stated that ""US arms shipments to Ukraine would be a dangerous step which could cause a rapid escalation"". According
to the federal government negotiations are the way to go, even it takes longer and is cumbersome and that the US government should remain behind negotiations.
The arms shipment plans coincide with an announcement of the rebels that they will raise 100000 soldiers. A survey in Russia showed that the number of people 
who expect an open war rose from 17% to 26% within the last three months, another 10% stated that such an open war was already ongoing.
- One year ago president Joachim Gauck called for more international responsibility, shortly after the situation in Ukraine took a turn for the worse. Today the 
political discussion in Germany has not advanced^2 and German policy still excludes any form of military action. The US arms shipment plan may return the topic to 
the agenda. The conflict many also put strains on European relations as Poland and the Baltics are more supportive of direct support of Ukraine. On the other hand
Germany might loose its last connection to Russia if they were to support arms shipments to Ukraine.

##Domestic Politics

###**The NSA investigation committee under pressure**
- The BND (engl.: Federal Intelligence Service) open talked to the committee about secret active mission run together with British and American intelligence services. The session was not marked secret, but 
talking or mentioning its contents effectively would damage the BND possible rendering it without cooperation of allies isolating Germany in the intelligence community. The committee therefore cannot report effectively on 
its finding. Soon afterwards the magazine Focus publishes the contents of the meeting. According to the NSA investigation committee the Federal Government or the BND must have informed Focus directly and the committee was not 
involved. The committee claims that the situation was caused to impede further investigations. The British government protested against the publishing of secret materials.

time of competitive restriction for politicians of 12 months up to 18 months. LobbyControl demands the time of competitive restriction to be set to 3 years.

###**Misogynist sermon by imam from Berlin**
- A Egyptian imam claimed that women are not allowed to leave the house without the permission of their husbands and must be
sexually steadily available for their husbands. The Turkish League Berlin/Brandenburg has pressed charges for defamation, sedition 
and suspicion of public provocation to violence. According to the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution the speech is 
considered antidemocratic. The Al-Nur-Mosque is a known meeting point of Salafists, but also non-Salafist Muslims come to pray there.
According to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in Berlin 600 people belong to the Salafists of whom 330 are violence-oriented.

###**Inconspicuous homeless women**
- 70000 women live on the streets in Germany, roughly one quarter of the homeless population according to estimations as there is no official
data. The number of homeless women in the 90s was around 15%, showing a steep increase over the last two decades. According to social scientists studying
the homeless in Germany women feel more shame in being homeless. A suspected reason for the increase is that while woman are more independent today, they still
earn less than men making them more susceptible to financial risks. Some of the homeless women even work for low wages, but the money is not enough to sustain an 
apartment.

###**Christian base clashes with Christian party over asylum seekers**
- The number of church giving shelter to asylum seekers on their premises rises quickly. Meanwhile the interior minister Thomas de Maizière stated that he rejects
church asylum ""basically and fundamentally"" as treating asylum seekers is the business of the state and not the church. The Federal Office of Migration is too 
overstrained to work the cases thoroughly. Statutory case-by-case reviews have not been performed at all according to church representatives. Support for refugees 
is common in many congregations and according to the protestant church church asylum does not menace separation of state and church. Church asylum exists in Germany for 
31 years now and 21 years ago an ecumenical body called ""Asylum in Church"" was founded. It is the most active ecumenical body and most active Christian endeavour in Germany. 
So far church asylum - while a breach of law - was considered minor and local governments advised police not to enforce it, but the increasing number in provided church 
asylum - 200 reported in 2014, estimated to be even twice as many - may change that. ""Asylum in Church"" advised churches to only take in cases of hardship - which under the 
law have a right to case-by-case review.

##Terrorism
###**Intent to join a terrorist organisation and financing terrorism will become a criminal act**
- To limit the flow of German citizens joining IS in Syria and to reduce the financial support new laws are to be enacted. The laws will make the intent to join a terrorist 
organisation punishable. In the new legal framework it will be possible to stop Islamists from departing from Germany on route to Syria. The current legislation against 
financing terrorism only covers considerable assets. The extended law will also make small scale contributions punishable - intended to stop fundraising events for terrorism.
- *Comment:* While the intentions behind this laws are laudable - reducing terrorism - the byproducts may not be. Intent to join a terrorist organisation is a very vague definition
in my opinion and prone to future abuse.

##Medicine
###**Germany considers easing access to medical cannabis treatment**
- Drug Commissioner Marlene Mortler plans to put medical cannabis treatment under health insurance coverage, effectively making the treatment available to more people. People in 
severe pain experience considerable pain reduction under medical cannabis treatment, but currently must fear a police investigation. Medical cannabis is expensive in pharmacies
 and not covered by health insurance. Home-growing cannabis in these cases is a grey area and may cause police investigations. The proposed law will mend these short-comings
 extending health insurance to medical cannabis and allowing people suffering from severe pain to grow cannabis.

1) Berlin. No discussion about that, at least 3 days, there is a lot to see and take in.

2) Hamburg. Real nice place as well, very diverse like in Berlin, weather might be shitty though so plan for that (actually not sure if it is good in May, I have only been in autumn so far). Also plan like 3 or so days.

3) Heidelberg. One of the touristic places to go, but don't plan anymore than 1 day for that, use it as a stopover to somewhere else, for example:

4) Black forest area. Essentially the whole state of Baden-Württemberg, there is a lot of nature to see there, though you will definitely need a car for that. For example there is a street which is named the official cuckoo clock street, I guess some people see that as typical German, not sure if that floats your boat.

5) If you are in the Black forest, go visit Freiburg. It is one of the southern cities close to French and Swiss border. And it is just beautiful, but also there you wouldn't need more than 2 days or so, it is not that big. If you are not completely restricted to stay in Germany I'd suggest that from Freiburg you can visit:

6) Strasbourg in France and
7) Basel in Switzerland quite easily, its about 1 hour drive from Freiburg, so you can still stay at some place in Freiburg and just drive there for a daytrip each. Really nice places with a lot to see.

For the rest of the days, not sure. Munich is nice too, especially as a tourist. Maybe Dresden. Other than that I haven't been around much in touristy places.


edit: Also, don't want to be negative, but don't expect to understand people unless you already have experience talking to native German speakers. You will hear very diverse dialects of German, especially when going from Berlin to Hamburg to Freiburg, so don't get hung up on it if it is not easy to understand. It is like that for most people learning German.

As well, if you don't have a car you can easily go from Berlin to Hamburg, then via Frankfurt/Mannheim to Heidelberg, from Heidelberg to Freiburg via Mannheim again. From Freiburg to Strasbourg there are busses or the train, same for Basel. Just don't expect the train travel to be cheap, unless you are ok wasting the hole day to get from Berlin to Hamburg for example.",null,0,null,1423389273,null,0,1423389530,0,coevjbw,null,t3_2v5ru3,null,t1_coevjbw,null,t3_2v5ru3,null,null,null,null,null,10,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,10,null

Il ne s'agit jamais mais alors jamais de savoir qui est le meilleur du privé ou du public. La seule chose importante est l'environnement dans lequel une personne puisse étudier. Enfants comme parents.

Le reste ce n'est que foutaise. En France, que tu sois riche ou pauvre, tes enfants pourront étudier, apprendre à lire / écrire / compter et bien plus encore.


Seule condition et c'est la seule, la laïcité, dans les écoles on ne doit pas parler de religion, on ne fait pas de politique ou très peu.
Sais tu par exemple que la police n'a aucun droit sur un campus universitaire ?
Sais tu que c'est là que ce forme les radicaux ?
Sais tu encore une fois que tu n’échappera pas  aux préjugés même de la part d'étudiant(e)s ayant un BAC en poche ?

Encore une fois, je te pris de m'excuser mais si tu veux la France, il ni a ni religion et une église dans chaque commune, ni science à t'apprendre mais une école qui te l'apprendra.

This may be because I live in a small working-class town and not a big city with tons of immigrants (we have many, but nowhere near as many as a large city would), but overall, race just isn't something the French worry about.

I'd be interested to know what kind of websites you're seeing filled with racism.  I'd be willing to bet that they are websites geared toward racists and xenophobes. 

&gt;Second, the fact that you can get arrested for saying something ""controversial"" on social media.

I honestly don't know what to tell you about this.  Yes, France has laws against hate speech that extend to social media.  Are you lamenting that such laws are in place to limit racism at the same time you are lambasting the country for being racist?  Also, your use of quotation marks tells me you might not see racist remarks online as controversial at all.

While I would say that there has been an upswing in racism, especially against immigrants, in the past few years, it is by no means ingrained into the culture of France.  

And while I can appreciate that you have done some research on the topic, you can't expect to fully comprehend any of the issues as they relate in the practical sense to France having never lived here.

However, I'm not really understanding what this has to do with Greece. At all. The comparison is pretty redundant. We're talking about two situations that are really two sides of the same coin - unity between nations. On one side, unity in the face of invasion and aggression. On the other side, unity in the face of a financial and political crisis.

According to this logic, we should just be like ""nah, let's just treat the guy who got shot because that other dude smoked all through his 20s so it's his own fault"". In reality, you can treat both. In reality, the people treating one patient are different to the people treating the other patient because you're looking at two different approaches to achieve the same goal - health. In reality, human beings are actually capable of resolving more than one thing at a time. At least, I would bloody well hope so.

&gt;The Greek collapse was caused by reckless and corrupt greek goverments, as well as reckless banks and structure problems of the euro.

The 'structural problems' of the euro weren't structural problems, they were purposefully created that way in an attempt to isolate the results of a countries profligacy from the other members, so that they wouldn't have to have a transfer union. And it worked. But, for political reasons, they decided to help out anyway.

&gt;The Greek people were punished severely for their past goverments' mistakes, but the banks that gave out the loans were rescued. Also the corrupt goverments of the past were awarded more years in goverment, by a narrative that said that if they don't get elected, Greece will be kicked out of the euro.

The greek people elected these governments. They, as a society, are responsible for what those governments do. If the governments fucked up, that's the fault of the people not choosing their politicians better and taking more interest in their democracy. Where was Greek civil society when the budget deficits were so high? What were they doing about the mounting debt? Why weren't academics, newspapers, and public figures speaking out against this? This cannot be characterized as any less than a failure of Greek civil society and democracy. 

The banks are not at fault. They offered to lend money under certain conditions. The government accepted those conditions.

&gt;There's no such thing as a ""bail out"". The money given is loans from which the powerful countries benefited, both by interest rates and also by having enough time to save their banks from contagion.

Of course there was a bailout. Just because other countries may have benefited from them, doesn't mean it wasn't a bailout. Also, I'd like to remind you, the interest from the loans is put back towards Greece under troika agreements, providing Greece reaches its targets. I'd hardly call that 'profiting' from it. If anything, it's charity.

&gt;The troika's only goal so far was to save european banks, and sell succesful public greek companies cheaply to private interests. At the same time to dismantle any labour protection laws and lower salaries so as to expand the neoliberal model of cheap labour/south east asia style working conditions inside Europe.

This is cynical in the extreme. The goal of the troika is to bring Greece back to economic stability. You can't expect that after such a colossal fuck up, things would be back to normal again after a year of hard times. But Greece has gone from budget deficits of 13%+, to primary surplus' of 4%+. That is a hugely positive development, and indicative that the packages are working for the long term. The issue, rather, is that past governments when presented with targets, have taken easy measures (service cuts and tax hikes) to try and meet them, rather than structural reforms that would actually benefit the economy.

&gt;Democracy was pretty much dead in the country during the troika years. Greek goverments didn't make any of the decisions, and laws were almost never passed through parliament. Even elections don't play a role to the troika, since all the officials make sure to point out that the same programme must be kept irregardless of who's in goverment.

Democracy wasn't dead. Part of democracy is taking responsibility for your actions. If you wanted Troika loans (although, really, a better word would be 'needed'), then you had to follow the conditions. The Greek people voted in their representatives, and their representatives wisely decided to try and meet those conditions.

&gt;Since the crisis, all eurozone countries suffer, especially the southern, weaker economies, while powerful banks and private companies on the more powerful economies are taking full advantage of it, making a lot more money.

This just seems like naive private sector bashing. ""Oh, evil banks, evil companies, evil rich people"". 

&gt;Through racial profiling, northern goverments have created the view of the hard working generous northerner who throws money away on the lazy southern beggar.

This is ludicrous.

And no, freedom of speech is not absolute. That doesn't mean you can get arrested for anything ""controversial"" arbitrarily. I'll jump on the occasion to say something : you say you don't want to be condescending, but you are being so right now. Just because a country doesn't have the same laws as you doesn't mean they're some kind of authoritarian dictatorship that acts on whims all the time. It's just different laws.

Life is not as diverse as one could image from hearing the term border city. Both countries are very germanic, the language is german. Well, it was german in Switzerland, but now it is a chopped up version. You get used to it and must swiss people can speak high German. If you have to get through with English at first that will be not problem at all.

In the touristic seasons you hear a lot of different languages, it is nice! We have visitors from all over the world - Constance is the touristic hot spot in South Germany, but not in a bad way.

It es very easy to travel over borders - on some days I do it multiple times. I even have to cross the border twice to get my groceries :-) Kreuzlingen and Constance are on different sides of the border but feel like one town.

It is very expensive. 15€/sqm for rent is not unheard of and the prices are inflated because of the strong CHF - but you will live where other people spend their holidays, so there is that!

Weather is awesome. I think we are second in place in terms of sunny hours per year. :-)

Well, I am climbing in a boulder center right across the border and of course there are the Alps. You are pretty much surrounded by great climbing spots driving one hours south.

If you live in Constance every spot is a at most a half a hour bike ride away. In fact I recommend getting a nice bike and getting rid of your car. Car sharing functions well here and mass transit is okay as well. Owning a car is hell for finding a spot to park... and you really don't need it here. Normal commute distances are like 10-15 minutes per bike. If you live in the suburbs like Litzelstetten it's more like 30 minutes.

*We've had a very difficult time getting a feel for whether it's possible to live in, say, Konstanz and work somewhere up along the way to the bigger cities, or if someone living in Konstanz or another smaller town would typically work in that same town as well. It's hard to get an idea of how autonomous/contained each city area is or whether people travel between the cities a lot in the course of a normal day.*
Which bigger cities do you mean? Constance is one of the biggest around here, Stuttgart and Zurich would be greatly bigger but also quite a distance away.

We have a lot of commute. Some live in Constance or one of the villages and work in Singen (ugly industry town) and vice versa. It's best to live in Constance and work here. The cities are interconected, but people only travel to the other cities to work.

If you visit, make sure to check in to the hotel, http://gaestehauscentro.de/eng/?noredirect=en_US I am doing work for it. Great place, nice price, right in the center of Constance.

I guess you are not from Germany judging from that description? :-)
You need around half an hour to get to Singen - that's 26 kilometres. It also roughly takes 40 minutes to Zurich airport and 60 minutes to the city itself.

As long as you are on a German highway you can estimate that you can travel around 120 kilometers per hour average, so it's pretty fast. You neeed 8 hours to get to Berlin from Constance and 3 hours to Munich, 2 hours to Stutgart.

Yes, a friend of mine works in Constance and lives in Stockach. 

What is your profession? You can PM me if you don't want to make it public, maybe I know a guy or can give you a hint on employment rate for that profession here.

I did some work for the towns Villingen-Schwenningen and Bad Dürrheim, that's about half way to Stuttgart from Konstanz. It took me 60 minutes to drive there. I know people visit Constance to enjoy the weekend or free days here or go shopping in the LAGO mall.


It is a fascinating area! I am a entrepreneur so I work at night or in the early mornings and spend my time in the summer relaxing by the lake. I even do business their with fellow Konstanzers! It is widely accepted that ""we"" are in a constant state of holiday coupled with productivity... so everything is a bit more leisurely. It's great. I know plenty of people - managers, lawyers, doctors and the like - who spend their lunch break swimming and showing up to meetings with wet hair!

Well, Constance is the most beautiful and biggest city with the most advantages. I would strongly advise against living in Friedrichshafen. I am indifferent to Lindau and all of the little villages along the lake (Meersburg for example) as they are very rural and some people like it. Constance still got the most life and innovation in it.

What kind of character are you looking for?

I hope I could help you and would be glad to do so even more!",null,0,null,1423392098,null,0,false,0,coew2eo,null,t3_2uw17v,null,t1_coew2eo,null,t1_codeoc0,null,null,null,null,null,0,false,GermanyPics,t5_348ch,0,null

Some people (me included, sometimes) feel that the law may be too restrictive, and the exceptions too politically influenced : that is a huge debate that is taking place right now in France (not so much in the open, in the media, but as a background question that really needs to be addressed). There is a double standard problem in France for many people with the freedom of speech.

The 2nd is more difficult to understand. There were lots of protests about such and such ostentatious actions of the police and school after january the 7th.

The reason why the anti-greek debt crowd refers exclusively to the doublespeak tag ""austerity"" instead of its true meaning, such as spending cuts, its because it's impossible to argue against the need of a state to cut public spending when the state just went bankrupt and is unable to loan additional funds to cover their daily expenditures.

Partirei con dire che di solito mi diverte Macchia, ma non sono un fan. Eccetto la tramma/commento che faccio sotto, ci sono varie battute e humour nel suo stile che non racconto. 
CONTIENE SPOILER. Consiglio di leggere e commentare solo dopo aver visto il film. 


Dal trailer, sembra che Verme (Marcello Macchia) , il personaggio principale, ha una vita ""normale"" che però cambia dopo aver ingerito una pillola che fa utilizzare il cervello soltanto al 2%, diventando così l'Italiano medio. Un buon trailer a parer mio, visto che non racconta tutta la storia. 

Invece, Verme è un perbenista esagerato che non è capace di migliorare nel minimo il mondo. E nemmeno la sua vita, se per questo. È frustrato  e inutile. Il suo obiettivo principale è difendere il parco dal un magnate media/edilizio che vuole costruire degli appartamenti di lusso, Rupert Sciamenna (Franco Mari). La prima critica va verso il perbenismo. 

Dopo la pilota, offerta dal suo amico d'infanzia ritrovato (Luigi Luciano) , Verme si trasforma in una specie di truzzo ignorante morto di figa. Non ha il minimo rispetto per niente e nessuno, fa qualsiasi cosa ci voglia per divertirsi, e si diverte nei modi più basilari: sesso, e fare il figo perché è famoso. Del parco, come di qualsiasi altra cosa, non li importa niente, però conosce Sciamenna. È tramite il suo reality show che Verme è diventato il più famoso. La critica è ovvia. È questo l'italiano medio che noi, il pubblico, stiamo deridendo? 


Finito l'effetto delle pillola, Verme si trova sotto shock ed è dispiaciuto del suo comportamento, però più avanti si trova in situazioni in cui ha bisogno del coraggio dato dall'ignoranza della pillola. Perde il controllo, è inizia a trasformarsi da perbenista a truzzo senza l'uso della pillola.

Qui si scopre che in verità il suo amico non ha mai avuto la pillola, Verme si era inventato tutto (ricorda un po Fight Club). Verme ha due personalità, una creata per contrastare i genitori ignoranti, e l'altra, completamente contrastante, che però ha soppresso finora. Alla scoperta di questa notizia, il suo cervello va in sovraccarico e collassa, andando in coma. Nella sua testa, le due personalità combattono per il controllo, e solo quando una vincerà, potrà Verme uscire dal coma.

Nel ospedale, davanti ad amici,  fidanzata, moglie e media, Verme riprende coscienza e chiede subito di parlare con Sciamenna, non è ancora chiaro quale delle due personalità ha vinto. Verme, riesce a convincere Sciamenna a risparmiare il parco, con un idea geniale che comunque renderà più soldi dei appartamenti di lusso: un reality show in cui i concorrenti ricostruiscono il parco. È un idea perversa, che non uccide il parco, ma lo rende teatro del ignoranza.



A Verme non importa più del parco e neanche del reality, ma non è neanche dispiaciuto ad avere a che fare con essi, per i soldi.
Torna con l'ex fidanzata, però non divorzia dalla moglie.
Dice che uno si può anche interessare della politica, mentre ci si po' anche fregare il cazzo di tutto.


Verme non è più perbenista e neanche truzzo, ma un dualista ipocrita. Tra i due estremi, ha scelto una via di mezzo. Verme è così diventato, l'italiano medio.

Questo siamo noi tutti, dei mediocri fidanzati a delle ragazze non proprio belle, a cui ogni tanto facciamo le corna con delle vacche. Gente che critica il politico senza seguire la politica e senza votare. Gente che si lamentela che il paese fa schifo mentre perde ore ogni giorno sui social. 

Quando Verme, al fine del film, ci consiglia che questo è il modo giusto di vivere, non dobbiamo ridere, ma piangere, perché è già quello che stiamo vivendo.

Effectivement, il ne suffit pas de se réclamer socialiste pour en être un mais l'inverse est tout aussi vrai.

Si tu chantes les louanges du libéralisme absolu, que tu rêves d'un monde sans Etat, où tout serait privé et où rien ne réglementerait les marchés, que tu agis comme un ultralibéral et que tu parles comme un néolibéral, il y a quand même peu de chance pour que tu sois un communiste du PCF.

Aujourd'hui on a des pays où l'Etat est absent de l'économie, où la privatisation est croissante et où les marchés sont dérégulés, regardons ce qu'ils font et regardons aussi ce qui se passe en France malgré la présence de l'Etat. 

On remarque entre autre des dérives dans l'économie : la privatisation se fait des fois au dépend de la qualité du service (santé / éducation / prisons aux USA, transport ferroviaire au Royaume-Uni, mutuelles / formation des chômeurs en France), les acteurs privés s'entendent sur les prix (Télécom en France, produits d'hygiène en Europe) ou sur les zones géographiques (Télécom aux USA), des publicités mensongères (cf. voitures électriques en France), des tromperies envers les consommateurs (viande de cheval, alimentation hypermarchés, viande halal qui n'en est pas), des manquements aux règles d'hygiène (restauration, certains hôpitaux, certaines prisons en France), des entreprises pratiquant l'évasion fiscale ou qui font travailler des travailleurs détachés dans des conditions horribles ... le tout, souvent dans l'illégalité parce que nos lois sont quand même pas toujours mal pensées mais aussi parfois avec la complicité de l'Etat.

Si ta réponse à ça est : plus de contrôle, plus de sanctions, plus de règles, l'Etat doit mettre son nez dans ces affaires et protéger les citoyens de ces dérives ... y'a peu de chance que tu sois ultra-libéral.

Tu peux même remonter un cran au-dessus, et tu constatera que le même principe s'applique a la BIS (""la banque centrale des banques centrales""), dont les membres sont des banques centrales, et dont certains dirigeants sont nommés parmi les banques centrales.

Initialement les banques étaient 100% privées, ce sont les États qui ont forcé ces banques a s'inscrire dans un modèle de banque centrale.

null,false,Tortulho,null,null,null,"&gt; With that said however what is left of Greek spending to be cut?

That has been repeatedly stated since 2010.

&gt;  They've cut wages, pensions and everything else. 

Wages and pensions aren't the only expenditure of greek's state. 

Additionally, in spite of the greek crisis, greek income levels are still around 2 to 3 times the income levels of their neighboring fellow EU members.

Additionally, if a state doesn't even manage to run a primary surplus and can't avoid a structural deficit then the real question isn't how spending cuts are inconvenient.

&gt; So taking the government out of the equation for a moment

The government and the state is the whole equation.  The effects their policies have on greek society is only the side-effect.

The string of greek governments up to 2010 fucked up immensely, because it forced the greek economy to adapt to fictitious GDPs that were made possible only through borrowing immense sums of money and by cooking the books.  Now, greece has to re-adapt to its real economy.  This means that the greek economy will have to support the wages it can actually support, it has to adapt to the GDP it actually has.  

&gt; It's been said time and again from many different people that these measures don't work

Yeah, right to the part where all the EU members that received a bailout are already recovering, and right to the part they claim that Greek economy is much more sound than in 2010 and that Greece now managed to get a primary surplus going.

&gt; especially in a country like Greece with no primary industry to support it.

That doesn't mean that Greece should keep on borrowing money to sustain an inflated economy while refusing to repay their loans.",null,0,null,1423394628,null,0,false,0,coewizl,null,t3_2v6iy1,null,t1_coewizl,null,t1_coew9hb,null,null,null,null,null,22,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,22,null

null,false,ABoutDeSouffle,GERM,Germany,null,"&gt;Greece should have never entered the euro. 

Yup, bad idea. Still understandable, because having a huge economic monolith right next to your border is tough if your economy is weak

&gt;The Greek collapse was caused by reckless and corrupt greek goverments, as well as reckless banks and structure problems of the euro.

I wouldn't blame the banks. Everyone pretended Greek loans were safe, so banks bought them. If they had not, you'd been accusing them of being unfair in the yeas befor the crisis. The underlying problem is in the construction of the Euro zone - too little political integration, too little oversight over the member countries.

&gt;The Greek people were punished severely for their past goverments' mistakes, but the banks that gave out the loans were rescued. 

Probably rescuing the larger banks was unavoidable, what with the Lehman's example. However, they should have been nationalized and then privatized later.

&gt;You can't ask for actual reforms in corruption and taxation from the people that built and conserved the system, since it goes against their interests. 

But this contradicts your later point about lack of democracy. If a country is hell-bent on electing corrupt politicians, what can you do except letting things run their course (bad) limiting their democratic rights (worse)

&gt;Also, most greek corruption scandals (the Siemens scandal, the faulty submarines scandal) are also connected to German interests, so Germany has no actual interest in fighting corruption and righting the wrongs of the past goverments. 

Doubtful. There's a nugget of truth in that Germany was quite late to impose strict anti-corruption laws concerning multi-nationals and their business abroad. Later on, to the best of my knowledge, German companies were fined and their managers put in jail. It's up to Greek to punish Greek nationals.

&gt;There's no such thing as a ""bail out"". The money given is loans from which the powerful countries benefited, both by interest rates and also by having enough time to save their banks from contagion.

True, no doubt about that.

&gt;The troika's only goal so far was to save european banks, and sell succesful public greek companies cheaply to private interests. 

Wrong. Selling off public companies is something that is quite normal in Northern Europe and if you got no money, you got to sell stuff. Troika had more goals, among them forcing Greek politicians to indeed act and stop pretending 

&gt;At the same time to dismantle any labour protection laws and lower salaries so as to expand the neoliberal model of cheap labour/south east asia style working conditions inside Europe.

Partly true, I'd say. Greek wages were clearly way [higher than productivity allows](http://snbchf.snbchfcom.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Eurozone-Labor-Costs.jpg), whereas in Germany due to some historical special factors they were actually decreasing. So get competitive, all this gains will have to be undone. The same will happen in Italy and eventually France.

&gt;Democracy was pretty much dead in the country during the troika years. 

True, let's see if this is going to change.

&gt;Since the crisis, all eurozone countries suffer, especially the southern, weaker economies, while powerful banks and private companies on the more powerful economies are taking full advantage of it, making a lot more money.

Partly true. Economists [all over](http://www.cp24.com/canada-to-face-growthless-recovery-oecd-1.410772) the [world](http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/how-can-we-explain-this-growthless-jobs-recovery-asks-thomas-molloy-29592370.html) worry about the state of the economy since a few years, calling it a [growthless recovery](http://prospect.org/article/it-not-jobless-recovery-it-growthless-recovery). And this is bad for private companies as well.

&gt;Through racial profiling, northern goverments have created the view of the hard working generous northerner who throws money away on the lazy southern beggar.

Come on, looking for a scapegoat now?

Le néolibéralisme, selon le Larousse, consiste a utiliser l'État pour promouvoir le libéralisme, ce qui est évidemment incompatible avec un monde sans État promu par les ultra-libéraux...

Je ne vais pas répondre a tous tes exemples un a un, mais pour illustrer je vais te citer les propos d'un ministre, socialiste, partisan de l'intervention de l'État dans l'économie, en ce qui concerne un de tes exemples (entente dans les télécoms). Voici ce que dit Montebourg :

""[...] quand je reçois l’Autorité de la Concurrence, je lui dis : vous êtes contre les ententes ? Moi, je les organise ! Qui a raison ? Vous êtes nommé, je suis élu, donc c’est forcément moi !""

C'est bien l'État qui organise l'entente et l'oligopole, en usant de son monopole des fréquences.

The only reason that France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland can still borrow money is that Germany stepped in and bailed out Greece (and others). If Greece had defaulted on its debts then these countries would face astronomical high borrowing rates, making their past and current deficits impossible to manage. This would have crippled all of Europe. 

This is why Germany had to bail them out and now enforce austerity. Greece now has to take a hit for the whole of the EU. Its not nice but this is the price they have to pay for membership. 

Greece did well out of the early years of its membership, living standards improved, infrastructure improved and so did social security. However tax intake has not improved particularly and the bureaucracy is still a nightmare. Greece was funded on cheap debt, that was guaranteed (not legaly but implicitly) by the euro zone and Germany.

I don't see how Germany can let them back out now. If they go, so may Italy, Spain and France. The Germans may look the worse out of this but what their doing is helping all of Europe, bar Greece.

Austerity can only be the start however. Once deficits are under control and the whole of Europe isn't surviving on the goodwill of lenders there has to be a change.

I've been to Greece a few times and I saw things that shocked me. Leaving the fact that I'm a workaholic and I rarely sleep more than 3 hours because of that, the first thing I saw in Greece was that everyone was living like there would be no tomorrow. That said, I've always believed that if someone is not part of the solution, then he/she is most likely part of the problem. Even the first time I went there when I was 11 or 12 I think, this is what I thought: this cannot possibly end well. 

Let's imagine the following: My managers invites the entire company to dinner at an expensive restaurant. Even if I order just a bottle of water, I'm still a part of the dinner. That goes for every one of us. But the managers order the most expensive crap there is and consume everything they possibly can. At the end of the evening my managers say that they cannot pay the bill(not likely because most of them are billionaires, but let's imagine that for a second). All the restaurant owner cares about is that table 7 has a bill of 9422 euros and 75 cents. Would it be fair to ask everyone to pay the bill even if we barely had anything? Yes and no. No because we barely had anything and yes because we all had a choice - work somewhere else and not be a part of it(vote for someone else).

Money may as well not be the best exchange form but it is the best we have so far. For many years not I've been telling everyone that money is tightly related to financial culture. Something that very few people have. I don't have any loans to my name but 3 people owe me money - a grand total of 3000 euros. I don't consider this a lot but if I gave it to them, they should not expect me to play cool and forget about it. I'm sending my parents on a two week holiday to France tomorrow. And you guessed it - it is going to cost me exactly 3000 euros.

A lot of people took advantage from the financial crisis, not just large companies. People who trade forex for example did as well *cough*I'm one of them*cough*.

The governments tried to save the banks - of course, what do you expect? Banks fail, ALL companies fail, working class dies - simple as that. This is what crisis means: everyone looses a lot and it doesn't get better overnight. I've visited most of the countries in the EU, and by far my favourite city is Berlin - the atmosphere, the people - everything is awesome about it from a tourist point of view at least. But keep this in mind - the Berlin wall fell just over 25 years ago. And even till this day you can tell east from west Berlin just by looking at it. After all the efforts, there is still a visible difference.

Regardless of your dislike of the term 'Austerity', it is actually useful because austerity is an ideological construct, not just a series of 'necessary' cuts as you like to portray it.

&gt;it's impossible to argue against the need of a state to cut public spending when the state just went bankrupt and is unable to loan additional funds to cover their daily expenditures.

It's quite possible, actually. When a country is in the middle of a depression, what it often needs is *productive* state expenditure to kickstart the economy. As Varoufakis proposes, the establishment of a European Investment Bank should be the organ through which the ECB implements QE - allowing new funds to be spent on establishing productive industry in countries that have been left wrecked by the '08 crisis, and were struggling even before then.

Greece's problems are structural, imposing further austerity on Greece is idiotic. Not only has austerity has made the Greek economy *worse*, it's actually not in the long-term interests of the debtor or the creditor to continue down the same path we've been going for the past 6+ years. There needs to be serious structural reform, not more austerity and more lines of cheap credit to keep the status quo ticking over - and for what it's worth, I don't mean reform in the neoliberal sense.

In a comedy, for example, you would miss an ironic joke because it's basically a normal sentence being said in a particular ""ironic"" way, which wasn't the same than in your language. 

Some jokes are way better when said very fast between characters, you lose that with subtitles. 

Sometimes, with sad emotions, squeeky english will kill the created mood by somehow being funny. 

Subtitles are fines in a movie action, but when there's a lot of talking that can't be fully written some of it simply get passed on and you miss the full thing. 

When there's beautiful images, one would rather fully enjoy them while listening rather than being distracted by text over it, which they have to look at rather than at what's fully going on on the whole screen. It kill the immersion. 

3D movies are already giving a bit of headaches when being too long. If you add subtitles what was something to be enjoyed become a pain to some people. 

When you're a big populated countries, you get to have some very talented people doing the translations and dubbing.

Dubbed movies can very well be better than the originals. That's even more true with for example Disney movies which have rhymed songs. 

Seriously, saying that it's just people being lazy is not only untrue but insulting. 

Sometimes it look like english- speaking people can't grasp the idea that a population would found more enjoyable to hear their own language with the fitting 'sound'.

So in other words a fire of corruption and rule bending being put out by more corruption and rule bending since you say yourself, those country's should not have been allowed to lend to a bankrupt Greek government under existing legislation.

Why are you not giving out about the moral hazard on behalf of the EU Creditor states that lent to a bankrupt Greek Government?
To me those loans are not valid, you can't lend to a drug addict begging for one last chance, because this time he will totally spend it on food.

Loans should not have happened and especially considering the Greek people got nothing for them, over 75% (or there abouts) of the money went straight to black holes in bank balance sheets and a good share of the rest being spent servicing legacy debt (so essentially to pay off more old loans and keep the donkey cart of a banking system afloat)

&gt;The greek people elected these governments. They, as a society, are responsible for what those governments do. If the governments fucked up, that's the fault of the people not choosing their politicians better and taking more interest in their democracy.

Oh more elitism from /u/SavannaJeff why am I not surprised, Would you care to guess what percentage of the population in your average EU state has a good understanding of economics and national finances, I would estimate maybe 10% and yet you hold an entire nation responsible for policy of a government that was voted in by less than half of them and whose policy's were maybe understood by 10% of them. 

This is one time where I may as well concede to your desire to be considered important and elite as you do understand economics (to a neo liberal extent anyway) which is why you can show no empathy to the other 90% who frankly run every time the topic is brought up. You somehow can't admit most people elect people because they don't know what they are doing. Should I now give up my vote if I don't understand macro economics because I may be held accountable for a bad decision my government makes in 10 years? That's pretty much your argument and it's pathetic.

&gt;Of course there was a bailout. Just because other countries may have benefited from them, doesn't mean it wasn't a bailout. Also, I'd like to remind you, the interest from the loans is put back towards Greece under troika agreements, providing Greece reaches its targets. I'd hardly call that 'profiting' from it. If anything, it's charity.

In a deflating eurozone *any* interest is profiteering so yes nations like mine have indeed made money off the back of Greek debt. Last I read 10 year Finnish bonds were now returning negative interest rates so us charging Greece anything about 0% is currently extortionist.  

Every country of the EU shares the euro but we do not share the risks, it seems the euro is not suited to Germany and only Germany and if you don't like it well more austerity for you until you know whats good for you.

Sorry but that's not how democracy works.

* Greeks kept electing governments that essentially bribed them with higher quality of living than the economy could actually afford. One example is the public sector that employed around 30% of Greek workers and had 50% higher salaries than the private sector. All financed with debt. Another is a lax attitude to tax collection, essentially giving the people tax breaks (nobody would've gotten elected saying ""we'll actually make you pay your taxes!"").
* The Greek economy has significant structural problems that prevent any kind of economic stimulus from working (as evidenced by masses of debt money that just disappeared into a black hole). These include corruption, bloated public sector, tax dodging, and rent seeking businesses.
* In order to have long term sustainability, the big structural problems must be tackled. There was no interest in doing so when the debt money was rolling in and life was good. The kind of change required can only happen in crisis. It will be very painful in the short term, but will lead to an actually viable economy in the long term.
* Greece has already got more than generous relief to their debt problem, given that the problems are entirely of their own creations. 50% of privately held debt was written down, interest rates and maturity terms are great, bailout doesn't need to be paid back for 8 years etc. The financial situation is tough but perfectly sustainable if the bailout terms are followed.
* The relief was largely driven by the need to secure the European financial system that was exposed to the Greek debt. Thanks to it and big restructuring of the Eurozone, Greece no longer threatens the financial stability of Europe, and therefore they cannot be allowed to blackmail Europe for better terms on their already great debt terms.
* The cure of austerity *works*. The GDP bubble caused by debt money has deflated, Greece is running a primary surplus and able to pay down its debts, and economy is on a growth track. Yes it's painful, but there are no painless long term solutions available. It's not ""punishment"", it's simply the economic reality of the situation.
* Greeks over estimate the quality of living that their economy should be able to provide, thanks to the GDP bubble that was pumped up with debt. They want other people's money to be pumped into the economy to inflate it again and provide a living beyond their own means. Their GDP should be around the same as Portugal's, which it is again after the bubble burst.

If you're consistently dismissed as racist by everyone else when you talk about immigration controls, and problems caused by a particular kind of immigrants, then you might have too. 

&gt; Germany has almost twenty million people with a migration background. When 1,800 of them chose to join ISIS

This is so disingenuous.Twenty million, who cares. You might as well talk about your whole population as if that made any sense. 

* What you have are 1.9 million muslim German citizens, out of which 1,800 have joined ISIS. That is huge. 

* Acting as if 1,800 is a final number, makes as much sense as assuming previous estimates in the 400s were a final number. They don't just stop going when an estimate is released.  

* Acting as if those who go is the whole universe of extremists in Germany makes no sense. Some will be too old to go, some will be too young, some will just stay just because they rather stay. 

* Acting as if only those that  extremist that they'd consider going to Syria are a problem makes no sense. Extremism and fundamentalism are not binary, but shades of grey. Plenty won't be that crazy but still very fundamentalist and problematic. 

Again, that kind of ridiculous dismissive discourse, is why Pegida exists.  It takes a really biased mind, and allow me to say 'radicalised' in a liberal far left sense, to believe there is no problem in these numbers.

Affatto. Qui in Italia si ha spesso una visione severa della lingua e si trova spesso gente che pone quesiti su incertezze ortografiche, lessicali e d'ogni altro genere. Ad esempio, [qui](https://www.facebook.com/tomshardware.it/posts/10151583715971471) puoi vedere un amministratore di un sito italiano che riporta il medesimo articolo della Crusca a giudizio della scelta fra scannare/scansionare/eccetera. Il parere di quel cruscone avrebbe influenzato la scelta lessicale di un gestore di quello che è a tutti gli effetti un mezzo di comunicazione di massa, e questa scelta avrebbe influenzato a sua volta tutti gli utenti del sito; ma, per ignavia o quant'altro, l'autore dell'articolo ha scelto di legittimizzare tutte le forme in uso senza nemmeno raccomandarne una; il che rende un servizio nullo a chi ha posto il quesito in cerca di una forma preferibile e riduce la funzione dell'accademia a quella di un banale vocabolario; così la gente si azzuffa tra di loro con discorsi spesso anche semplicisti come ""scanner -&gt; scannerizzare"" e alla fine esce vincitrice la forma a cui più gente semplicemente è abituata.

&gt;Non mi pare che ci sia alcun ragionamento etimologico che possa farne vincere una sulle altre.

Basterebbe dire che forme come ""scansionare"" e ""scannerizzare"" sono parole inutilmente pesanti e concettualmente ridondanti: infatti significano rispettivamente ""sottoporre a una scansione"" e ""sottoporre alla macchina che esegue scansioni"", quindi non c'è motivo di preferirle a un semplicissimo scandire; sarebbe solo una raccomandazione, che ha il suo peso per quelli a cui importa della lingua ma poi è chiaro che non obbliga nessuno. 

Poi, se i traduttori avessero tradotto ""scanner"" con ""scansore"" o ""scanditore"" a quest'ora diremmo tutti ""scandire"", cosiccome diciamo ""stampante"" e ""stampare"" per l'oggetto che gli inglesi chiamano *printer*.",null,0,null,1423397407,null,0,false,0,coex0ym,null,t3_2uzudy,null,t1_coex0ym,null,t1_coehmfs,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1,null

Mind you, this is the opinion of the average citizen, not the EU.

They've elected it.  It was their own, free choice.  Each decision has consequences, and they freely chose this path.

Furthermore, they also spent the last decade or so enjoying the benefits of the massive overspending they mandated their governments to perform and elected them on their promise they would keep it up.

&gt; As for the EU members that have received bailouts recovering, I was under the impression that both Spain and Portugal were both in a very similar situation to Greece or is that not the case?

No, not quite.  

Portugal entered a recession in 2008/2009, and was battling an unemployment rate reaching 25%.  It received a EU/ECB/IMF bailout in 2011.  The recession ended in 4Q 2013/1Q 2014.  The bailout program ended 2Q 2014.  Currently its unemployment rate is around 14%.  Portugal hasn't recovered completely, but its safe to say that the looming bankruptcy of 2011 is no longer an issue.

&gt; I can't speak about the wages compared to other countries, but they've been more than halved compared to what they used to be in Greece

They are still 3 times greater than the wages in Greece's EU neighbours. 

&gt;  it has gotten to the point where people are unable to house themselves any more. 

In a country with 11 million inhabitants, when there's an economic crisis there are always people who are caught by surprise.  The same problem happens in economic upturns as well.  

&gt; I'm also going to call shenanigans here, because this is blatantly untrue:

For anyone to believe that, it requires a major cognitive dissonance.  You can't pin the problem on how a government set its state's budget and then proceed to claim that the way a government decided its state's budget is not the source of the problem.

&gt;  if you think the people of Greece deserve to suffer

No one said that.

We don't mute our TVs and just read the subtitles. We can still hear everything...

&gt;When there's beautiful images, one would rather fully enjoy them while listening rather than being distracted by text over it, which they have to look at rather than at what's fully going on on the whole screen. It kill the immersion.

Oh right. And voices and actors' mouth movement not matching doesn't kill the immersion?

&gt;When you're a big populated countries, you get to have some very talented people doing the translations and dubbing

Yes cause the real actors' voices... meh. 

&gt;Sometimes, with sad emotions, squeeky english will kill the created mood by somehow being funny.

I have no idea what you mean by ""squeaky English"" but essentially you're saying ""the way it was intended by the original creator kills the mood""

&gt;Dubbed movies can very well be better than the originals.

Haha, this is glorious! How the hell can you make this statement? If you don't speak the original language well enough to not need subtitles or a dubbed version you can't accurately compare them.

-----

This is the thing: most Dutch people will understand English and could probably follow everything quite well. The subtitles just make it a bit easier. A lot of people in Germany, France, Spain, etc simply wouldn't be able to understand.

&gt;Seriously, saying that it's just people being lazy is not only untrue but insulting.

Well it's a *bit* true, isn't it? OP is Dutch. Do you think people there speak so many languages because they have some innate talent? No. They take the effort to teach it in schools and the government spends a lot of money on it. Other countries could easily do this as well. Laziness might not be the best way to describe it (perhaps it's more a matter of priorities) but it's part of the reason.",null,0,null,1423398272,null,0,false,0,coex6qx,null,t3_2v6n49,null,t1_coex6qx,null,t1_coewy67,null,null,null,null,null,-8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-8,null

To my surprise wikipedia says that Europe only had 2500 cases of measles in 2014, which cant be true according to the WHO report (maybe if you only account for European Union countries).

It's also a great tool to deceive people in taking the year with the lowest numbers of measles and comparing it with the current year. Yes, 2007 only had about 7000 cases of measles in europe, but 2005 had 37.332, 2010 had 30,000 and 2014 11.000. In 1980 we had 851,849 cases of measles in europe. From 1980 to 2014 we had a 7744% decrease in measles, from 2005 to 2014 we had a 339% decrease in measles. From 2010 to 2014 we had a 272% decrease but from 2007 to 2014 we had an increase of 348%. What now, increase or decrease? Yesterday I didn't eat any bread, today I ate some. Statistics say my bread intake increased by 100% from yesterday to today. Statistics man, they can fuck with you.

The reason america is freaking out about measles is because of the fear mongering. They had 188 cases of measles in 2013, 644 in 2014. I mean what the fuck, these people call themselves journalists?

Il y a quand même une différence entre « Les DUT sont majors de promo » et « Les prépas ne sont bons à rien en pratique. » La différence majeure étant que les deux n'ont rien à voir ou presque, en fait.

Personnellement, je n'ai aucune idée du major de promo, étant donné qu'on n'a pas vraiment de notes, déjà (honnêtement, si en tant qu'élève ingénieur tu juges encore de la qualité de quelqu'un à ses notes… bref). Quant à la différence de savoir pratique, elle est quand même très vite nivelée si l'école fournit un enseignement de qualité, hein. Faut pas exagérer.

Nos profs ne nous ont jamais fait ce genre de remarques, et si je devais chercher à comparer, je vais confirmer les « clichés ». À savoir, celui qui serait sans doute le « meilleur » en technique serait un BTS (parce que oui, il n'y a pas que DUT/fac), mais dès qu'on passe en analyse (stats, traitement global, etc.), les prépas se débrouillent en moyenne mieux. Après, vu la taille de l'échantillon statistique, ça n'a évidemment aucune valeur.

Quant à ta remarque sur « l'élite », je vais partir du principe que c'est une blague… Si un prépa de ton école te fait encore ce genre de remarque, je te prierai de bien vouloir lui coller un pain dans le museau de ma part.

Comunque dovresti avere al netto delle tasse 9975€. 

Dovresti, con questi soldi devi anche pagare l'acconto INPS per il prossimo anno, un 60% su quello versato quest'anno se non erro, altri 2700€(60% di 4500€). Questo non è un problema per gli anni successivi al primo poiché pagherai sempre 40%(anno corrente) + 60%(acconto anno successivo) = 100%. Il primo anno invece dovrai pagare il 100% del primo anno + il 60% come acconto per l'anno successivo.

And I'm sure many, many people read the subtitles because otherwise they wouldn't fully understand.

What I think they should do is use *English* subtitles. Allow people to choose between their language as well as English (for the hearing impaired).

&gt;they shouldn't seek freedom as they would be suppressing the property rights of slave owners, 

The 'freedom ends when it clashes with other freedoms' axiom would mean that a person's right to not be property over-rides the property rights of a slave owner.

Greece cannot pay back its debts, yet it would set a dangerous precedent if we'd forgive those debts. As such their best option is to leave the Euro zone. It may cause chaos in Greece, but is that much worse than what they've already gone through? Instead of sending billions, the EU could send humanitarian aid instead if needed. It may hurt Greece a lot momentarily, but that's better than struggling for decades.
  
If that cases the collapse of the Euro, or even the EU, so be it.

1. I think that LAOS can hardly be compared to GD. it was more of a right wing *populist* party and gave up its extreme right and racist rhetoric very early on. It seamlessly integrated into the political system as a systemic component and civic violence was never part of their agenda. On the contrary, GD is by all means a violent hate group and a criminal organization (if so proven in court). Also, voter ""migrations"" according to polls were not one-to-one from LAOS to GD. You might be surprised to hear that at least in the double national elections 2012 a good 5% of voters of the Communist Party voted for GD. History is a bitch though, you did mention the Weimar Republic during which at least in one occasion the Communists cooperated with the Nazis in the strike of the transport workers in Berlin. Of course they were later annihilated using the [Reichstag Fire Decree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_Fire_Decree) but that is beside the point...

2. SYRIZA got 36,4% in the last elections and that is a long way from 40% that you mentioned. While it is true that more than 2 million people voted for them, that does not make all their voters libertarians or leftists or communists. Wanna bet on this? Take a couple of ""leftist"" policies for example. SYRIZA is also pro drug decriminalization and also pro State-Church separation. If they try to push such an agenda they would be probably banging their heads against the wall. Besides I never claimed that Greece is turning into a Weimar-like state. I just said that especially with such high employment rates, social coherence is definitely not guaranteed.

3. SYRIZA is commonly called ""far left"" especially on International Media but it seems that these days anyone who doesn't agree with neoliberals (Christian-Democrats and reborn ""Socialists"" alike), or has a pro-workers agenda is far left.

null,false,Ostrololo,EURO,Living in the Netherlands,null,"&gt; Subtitles ""destroy"" the movie feeling as you are concentrating on reading instead of watching.

It really doesn't. It might seem like so because you're inserting a ""non-movie"" element so it ""breaks immersion"", but for people **used to** subtitles, the brain just absorbs this as a natural part of consuming that media. The brain is trained to interpret ""looking at the movie"" and ""reading the subtitles"" as connected parts of the same ""watching the movie"" activity. You don't even register that you're reading the subtitles.

Another example is said-ism in literature. Authors in general use the word ""said"" a lot in dialogue, for example:

&gt; “Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s writing to me?”

&gt; “No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.”

&gt; “It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.”

Because I pointed it out, you must've noticed the writer uses ""said"" three times. Generally word repetition is bad, but in this case ""said"" isn't a normal word. It serves just to organize the dialogue's structure, so the brain doesn't typically register it, because it's used to it. In fact, when writers try to actively *avoid* repeating ""said"" and start using a variety of other verbs, the prose starts sounding overly elaborate and purple.

Subtitles serve the same purpose. At first glance they look like they *obviously* distract from the movie, but to those accustomed to them, it just goes on automatic, they barely register them. Another example are speech balloons in comics or user interfaces in games (if the interface is well designed).",null,0,null,1423399386,null,0,false,0,coexern,null,t3_2v6n49,null,t1_coexern,null,t1_coewpz8,null,null,null,null,null,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11,null

&gt;The 'freedom ends when it clashes with other freedoms' axiom would mean that a person's right to not be property over-rides the property rights of a slave owner.

The axiom cuts both ways, that's why it's a crap axiom.  That's why you need a principle that says ""property rights of slave holders do not override the freedom of slaves to not be priory property"".

I know that it might suit your simplistic narrative to assume that there is no interdependence between EU states and banking sectors - thus enabling you to isolate the 'profligate' nations so you can play the personal responsibility card - but it's not as simple as that. One of the key factors with regards to the Irish government feeling pressured into accepting a bailout was the fact that German regulatory rules enabled German Banks to acquire AAA-rated *international* assets and plop them on their balance sheets - making the crisis a German (and hence Eurozone) crisis, as much as an Irish one. I assume you understand the concept of a capital adequacy ratio - so when these assets lose their 'value', it becomes necessary for the bank to acquire further capital in order to continue functioning. Had Ireland not been pressured into accepting a bailout, and had Germany not *organised and offered one*, the problem would simply have shifted from Ireland and the other periphery nations needing to recapitalise their banks, to the center where Germany itself would have had to recapitalise its *own* banks on the back of buying up shit assets. This was such a problem that between '09 and '12 German banks reduced their exposure to capital in the periphery by 50%. So, no - I'd argue that the Euro has serious structural problems - part of the shit we're in is due to the fact that we don't have a surplus recycling mechanism. Your view of the Euro managing to perform its function during the '08 crisis is just a thin veneer of crap straight from the pages of the *Bild*.

&gt;The greek people elected these governments. They, as a society, are responsible for what those governments do. If the governments fucked up, that's the fault of the people not choosing their politicians better and taking more interest in their democracy. 

How does it feel to live in ahistorical bootstrap-land, where external forces of power outside of your control don't shape your personal life and society in a broader sense? Where do I apply for a visa?

&gt;This is cynical in the extreme. The goal of the troika is to bring Greece back to economic stability.

Just because you disagree with it doesn't make it cynical, but nice rhetorical pitch. The IMF is renowned for implementing neoliberal 'reform' on every continent under the guise of bringing countries back to 'economic stability'. If the Troika wanted to bring Greece or any of the periphery nations back to 'economic stability', they wouldn't be throwing cheap credit at a series of structural problems, whilst demanding the fire-sale of productive assets and the stripping back of social safety-nets. They'd be funding productive investment, or they would restructure the debt in a way similar to the way the Allies restructured German debt in '53 - in which ""repayments were only due while West Germany ran a trade surplus, and that repayments were limited to 3% of export earnings.""

&gt;This just seems like naive private sector bashing. ""Oh, evil banks, evil companies, evil rich people"". 

Nice to see you brush aside a valid point about the flow of capital from periphery nations to the center with cheap right-wing populist claptrap.

&gt;&gt;Through racial profiling, northern goverments have created the view of the hard working generous northerner who throws money away on the lazy southern beggar.

&gt;This is ludicrous.

It's clear that you obviously don't read the papers over here. The 'lazy Greeks/Spaniards/Italians/Portuguese/Irish (not so much the latter anymore) is a common narrative.

Later on, to the best of my knowledge, German companies were fined and their managers put in jail. It's up to Greek to punish Greek nationals.

It's not entirely up to Greece. Michalis Christoforakos, the most important Greek official that was found guilty for the Siemens Scandal in 2008 , escaped in Germany. The Greek authorities have continuously requested for him to be handed back to Greece in order to be judged for his crimes, but the German authorities refuse to do so.

What is lektor, you might ask? Imagine someone took subtitles and, instead of displaying them on the screen, had a guy read them aloud, drowning original audio track under his monotonous voice. I guess this was a middle-ground solution between expensive dubbing and poorly readable subtitles.

The situation is currently as follows:

* Animation is always dubbed, except maybe for some adult-oriented shows airing on TV, which occasionally may have lektor instead.

* Movies and shows for kids are dubbed. This includes e.g. *Harry Potter* movies.

* German-language movies tend to be dubbed. We don't like the sound of the German language.

* Disney is pushing for their live-action movies to be dubbed; usually they're shown in cinemas in both versions (for example, all their superhero movies, or *Star Wars VII*). *Hobbit* was dubbed too, despite *LotR* not being.

* Almost everything else shown in cinemas is subbed.

* Some movies were dubbed only later, for VHS/DVD release (for example: *Return of Jedi* was dubbed in 2011).

* Younger people are used to watching pirated movies with subtitles.

* Live-action movies and shows on TV almost always have lektor.

* Most DVD releases have two audio tracks, one with lektor and the second original.

* Some TV stations sometimes provide alternative, original audio track with extra subtitles.

People aren't dismissed as racist because they talk about immigration controls or problems in our refugee policies, but because they talk and behave in racist. Unfortunately these people either don't know what constitutes racist behaviour, or they want to make others believe that their behaviour is completely acceptable. 



&gt;What you have are 1.9 million muslim German citizens, out of which 1,800 have joined ISIS. That is huge. 

1,800 out of [4,300,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Germany) is not huge and does in no way justify to reduce the entirety of all Muslims to the actions of Islamists.


&gt;Acting as if 1,800 is a final number, makes as much sense as assuming previous estimates in the 400s were a final number. They don't just stop going when an estimate is released. 

&gt;Acting as if those who go is the whole universe of extremists in Germany makes no sense. Some will be too old, some will be too young, some will just stay just because they rather stay. 

&gt;Acting as if only those this extremist that they'd consider going to Syria are a problem makes no sense. Extremism and fundamentalism are not binary, but shades of grey. Plenty won't be that crazy but still very fundamentalist and problematic. 

So you believe that of the 4,000,000 Muslims in Germany a considerable percentage would like to fight for ISIS but simply cant for various reasons? You should probably read some studies about the motivations and the personal backgrounds of those who chose to join ISIS. You will find out that their stories aren't different from natives who chose to become violent right-wing extremists. The Danish city of Aarhus reduced the number of ISIS related departures from 33 to 1 in a single year just by listening to these people, helping them with their problems and convincing them that the ""holy war"" won't turn them into people with purpose in this world. What we need is an EXIT program for Islamists, not a debate about the alleged nature of Islam that will only drive more Muslims into isolation and probably extremism.



&gt;Again, that kind of ridiculous dismissive discourse, is why Pegida exists.

We are talking about right-wing extremists here. About Neo-Nazis and even holocaust-deniers. This exactly the kind of discourse these people deserve. And if you decide to ignore that fact and follow these people anyway, you disqualify yourself for any qualified discourse. I have spent the last four months talking with PEGIDA supporters. I have yet to meet one who does not reveal himself as an uninformed xenophobe after three sentences.


&gt;It takes a really biased mind, and allow me to say 'radicalised' in a liberal far left sense, to believe there is no problem in these numbers. 

I never said that there is no problem! I have said that problem is not immigration or Muslims in general, but a very specific subset of the Muslim population. See, that is the problem with PEGIDA supporters: The don't know the facts, they can't read and understand, they don't know or understand their vocabulary and they cannot differentiate.

When I talk with PEGIDA supporters about what they mean with ""Islamization"", they something like ""Berlin-Neukölln"". That is not islamization! 4 Million Muslims in a country with 80 million people is not islamization! Berlin-Neukölln is a so called ""social hot-spot"" with a considerably high foreign population. The PEGIDA supporters are concerned social hot-spots and radicalism, just like everybody else. And rightly so, because these problems exist. But the PEGIDA people fail to discuss these problems in an informed, differentiated, problem- and solution-oriented way without turning into racist retards through their vocabulary and behaviour (or the people they decide to follow). And then they cry blue murder when no is taking them seriously.

It might surprise you that I'm not a leftist. In fact I'm very dismissive of the leftish parties in Germany and I'm actually quite conservative, maybe even right-leaning when it comes to our immigration and refugee policies. But I was never accused of being a xenophobe or racist when I was discussing these topics, not even by leftists. I wonder why?

Education is the responsibility of the states in Germany, so the answers can differ a lot.
I checked the curriculum for history at Gymnasiums in Lower-Saxony and... it is not exactly straight forward.

The ""frame topics"" taught rotate. If you made Abitur in 2011 you had one different topic than the students who get their degree in 2012 (at least I think it works this way). I don't know why that is, maybe so the teachers don't get bored teaching the same contents all the time.

The teachers have a certain freedom how they teach the topics. German colonial history is (in Lower-Saxony) part of the topic ""Nationalism and German imperialism"". The perspectives that should be taught are national and global. It belongs into the categories ""Peace and War"", ""Freedom and Rule"" and ""The Individual and the Society"", that are the viewing angles I guess. The contents are ""Motives of German agitation (Kolonialverein, All-deutscher Verband)"", ""Practice of German colonial politics (amongst others German-South-West Africa)"" and ""Germanys world power ambitions at the time of Wilhelm II and the consequences"". ([Source](http://db2.nibis.de/1db/cuvo/datei/kc_geschichte_go_i_03-11.pdf), German)

So it is possible to have learned about it in history classes in Lower-Saxony, but if this frame topics ""Nationalism and German imperialism"" happens not to be in your rotation you probably didn't. That being said, some big topics like WW1 and WW2 are always taught.

In the German mind this particular genocide is somewhat overlain by the holocaust.

null,false,omgitskratos,PORT,"Porto, Portugal",null,"For all the people that are not familiar with the Spanish naming system let me explain to you the Portuguese first:

If someone is name Gonçalo Marques Silva, Marques is the mother's last surname, Silva is the father's, and Gonçalo is the given name. He usually goes by Gonçalo Silva.

If Gonçalo Marques Silva marries Sofia Rodrigues Garcia and they have a daughter whose given name they decide to be Sara, the newborn will be named Sara Garcia Silva. The mother can have her name stay like that or add her husband's last surname (so: Sofia Rodrigues Garcia Silva).

In Spanish the same occurs. But backwards.

So, if someone is named Gonzalo Marquez Silva, Marquez is the father's first surname (which is the main one), Silva is the mother's and Gonzalo is the given name. He usually goes by Gonzalo Marquez. Notice that it's backwards from Portuguese.

If Gonzalo Marquez Silva marries Sofía Rodriguez Garcia and they have a daughter whose given name they decide to be Sara, the daughter will be named Sara Marquez Rodriguez.

Now that you understand the basics you must know that there are some things that vary:

- Many people in Portugal and Spain have double given names (more so in Portugal than in Spain I guess?). So Gonçalo Marques Silva could easily be Gonçalo Miguel Marques Silva.

- Some parents add both of their last names to their child. So, Sara Marques Rodrigues could easily be Sara Rodrigues Garcia Marques Silva.

- Some names sound better if you include a preposition before them I guess (you'd have to speak the language to understand this). So, while Sara Garcia Silva is a decent name, Sara Garcia **da** Silva sounds better I guess (another common example: dos Santos instead of Santos).

- With the combination of the last, we could easily see someone in Portugal named Sara Maria Rodrigues Garcia Marques da Silva, where Sara and Maria are given names and the rest is the parent's surnames.

- With that being said the most common set of names in Portugal is: Given name 1 + Given name 2 + Mother's last surname + Fathers last surname. That person usually goes by Given Name + Last Name (father's last surname). So, for example: Sara Maria Garcia da Silva who goes by Sara Silva. In Spain: Given Name + Father's First Surname + Mother's First Surname. That person usually goes by Given Name + Second name (father's first surname). Example: Sofía Garcia Silva who usually goes by as Sofía Garcia.

- Lastly, while most people in Portugal go by First given name + Last surname, others choose to go by other combinations. Examples: the prime minister Pedro Manuel Mamede Passos Coelho goes by as Pedro Passos Coelho or simply as Passos Coelho. Therefore people could call him Mr. Pedro Passos Coelho or Mr. Passos Coelho but not Mr. Coelho (that would be strange). This happens because some names in Portugal are *extremely* common: if you meet a girl named Maria Silva it's fucking impossible to find her on Facebook - trust me.

On the other hand, I don't know how you can ignore the fact that other euro countries like Spain, who were a lot more responsible with their spending, had almost the same problems and ignore the structural problems of the euro.

For those that say austerity and the troika programme works, really I think only an outsider looking at a bunch of numbers can actually say that. A programme that pushes unemployment from 5% to 30% and keeps it there for 7 years to be called a success is to me really funny as a concept.

This article, for instance, barely touches on Greece's repeated and bloated budget deficits (and the democratic responsibility of Greek voters to manage their society). The article essentially blames 'rich Europe' for the poor investment and spending choices of the Greek governments.

&gt;The German economy responded to French capital inflows in almost the same way that several peripheral European economies responded to large German capital inflows 135 years later. It might seem an unfair comparison at first because the 1871-73 transfer to Germany was huge, but it turns out that the magnitude of the French transfer into Germany was broadly similar, in fact probably smaller, to the inflows into peripheral Europe

Pettis makes this link, without bothering to go too in depth about how the capital inflows were spent, either by the private sector, or the public. I can't speculate as to the public, but we know that much of that spent by the private was wasteful, whether through poor analyses of the benefits, or through corruption and graft.

He even admits that many of his opinions are minority ones

&gt;for those — including, distressingly enough, most economists — who believe a country’s savings rate must be driven only, or mainly, by domestic household preferences

But then we get to this part

&gt;I am not rejecting the claim that “Spain” acted irresponsibly, in other words, only to place the blame on “German” irresponsibility. But it is absolutely wrong for Volker Kauder, the parliamentary caucus leader of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, to say, according to an article in last week’s Bloomberg, that “Germany bears no responsibility for what happened in Greece. The new prime minister must recognize that.” There was indeed plenty of irresponsible behavior on both sides, during which time wealth was transferred from workers of both countries to create the boom and to absorb the subsequent bust, and wealth will be transferred again from middle class households of both countries to clean up the resulting debt debacle. *Put differently, there is no national virtue or national vice here, and there is no reason for the European crisis to devolve into right-wing, nationalist extremism* [emphasis mine]

In the article, Pettis uses 'Spain' to refer to periphery countries, and 'Germany' to refer to rich core countries. And in part, he's right. There is nothing to the 'national vice' or 'national virtue' rhetoric, and I've always rejected it. I don't think that profligacy is a characteristic Greek vice (and household debt levels are indicative of this). My argument has always been that Greek civil society *failed*. 

Let me repeat that, *Greek civil society failed*. The academics and experts weren't warning loud enough what the constant budget deficits were doing to the country, the media wasn't doing enough to report what was going on (whether professional media, or citizen media), Greek voters weren't agitating against the blatantly nepotistic, corrupt, and graft-ridden practices of the elite by protests, voting differently, or forming their own parties.

I mean, Jesus, **there were [warnings](https://ideas.repec.org/p/nig/wpaper/9602.html) dating back to '95 that Greek budget deficits were a problem**.

Its all fantasy especially since krugman lives in the country where its still trusted to pay back its debts and not many other countries have that privilege.

Yeah life sucks, but honestly the idea of borrowing and spending and raking up the debt = fine because 'investment'

Didn't really work for many countries who later got bailed out by the IMF because creditors stopped lending to them after they either defaulted on their debts or their bond yields went up dramatically which is basically interest in all but name. After international creditors realized they couldn't pay whether its because their deficit became too high or their economic strucutre was unstable or because their main exports like commodities either slumped or the price of it went down.

In the meantime many things can be done to prevent debt going up dramatically, extensive regulation of the housing sector to prevent bubbles, financial sector to prevent financial bubbles/collapse, and budget restraint. The third is hard sometimes because citizens are never patient and this sometimes lead to behavior that results in the other two being deregulated in attempt to create growth which will only lead to economic bubbles. And a corresponding rise in debt when those bubbles pop.

This is somewhat open to interpretation. It's true I suppose that there is some benefit for the entire population of making an economy look stronger than it is. But this narrative also makes it sound like the Greeks were living a life of leisure and luxury during the 80s and 90s, which is far from the truth. I visited Greece regularly in these decades, and the quality of life was much more like a developing country than European. You only had to cross the sea to find a much higher living standard over in Italy. On visiting India in recent years, I've reflected that inland Greece, including the ""prosperous years"", seems somewhere in the middle of Europe and India. (No disrespect meant to either nation.)

And while I don't doubt that there was a huge bloated public sector propped up by loans, the saturation of it still looks exaggerated to me. Of the hundreds of people I've hung out with in Greece during these years, I don't know anyone who worked in the public sector. They were supporting themselves by things like running convenience stores, growing fruit, breaking marble, driving taxis and herding cattle. A lot of self-employment in start up companies and short time employment in the private sector. While these are just the small selection of people I've encountered, it's worth noting that while tourism was big and many Europeans had some interaction with Greeks, the stereotype of the Greek with the cushiony government job didn't really exist until 2010.

Now, Syrizas claim is that there is a huge top sector in Greece that was and is still enjoying ""tax immunity"", that has not been adequately dealt with by the austerity program, that needs to be properly taxed and help bear the burden now carried by the Greek people. Are they wrong in this claim? Because this, along with a new drive to actually root out corruption, sounds like they are much more focused on actually getting to the core of the problem than the previous pro-austerity government.

Also, from your previous comment:

&gt; That doesn't mean that Greece should keep on borrowing money to sustain an inflated economy while refusing to repay their loans.

As far as I understand it, they agree with you?

Dovrebbe essere così, detrazioni invece le togli dal totale IRPEF da pagare. Però nel regime minimi non paghi l'IRPEF ma un'imposta sostitutiva e non se deduzioni e detrazioni IRPEF valgano in questo caso.

In the case of Greece, a lot of the inflows were spent by the public sector. In the case of Spain and Ireland it was the private sector. In the case of the indemnity money, it was the public sector. Pettis' argument is simple: Time and time again, when countries are faced with capital inflows of this magnitude they find it impossible to deal with them and prevent bubbles and waste. It's simple as that. Greece isn't a special case because Germany in the 1870s and Germany in the 1930s wasn't either.

The old ""if you don't agree with me then you are an evil ~~fascist~~ neoliberal"" personal attack.

&gt; Regardless of your dislike of the term 'Austerity'

My problem with doublespeak is that people who insist on using it are desperately trying to avoid actually arguing the problem and how to solve it.  

So, they cowardly hide behind doublespeak and emotional bullshitting excuses to avoid discussing the issues and force everyone to blindly swallow their baseless beliefs. 

No one in the world argues against the need to cut spending when facing bankruptcy.   No one in the world argues against the need to balance the budget when facing bankruptcy and they are unable to borrow any more money.  

So, people like you avoid arguing it altogether, so instead resort to doublespeak and emotional bullshit excuses to avoid actually fixing the problem. 

And when someone points out the obvious, then queue in the insults and personal attacks and blanket cliché accusations.

&gt; It's quite possible, actually. When a country is in the middle of a depression, what it often needs is productive state expenditure to kickstart the economy.

Once you beam down to reality and factor in the fact that you already are dealing with massive sovereign debt and not a single soul in the world is willing to lend you a penny more, you are then forced to face the fact that cutting spending is not only an inevitability but also a pressing need.

You see, spending cuts aren't something that's done lightheartedly, but it's a mandatory requirement if you are ramping up 13% deficits, you ran out of money, you're living on loans, and you wish to actually keep your state functioning. 

Therefore, as this is politically inconvenient for you to admit and you are unable to argue against it, you resort to bullshitting the world with this doublespeak make believe strawman that is custom-made to serve as an emotional bogeyman.

I never said it was fine. I said it did it's job, with respect to not forcing other countries to help a country in crisis. All help was of a voluntary nature, because there are no mechanisms with which to do it otherwise. The Euro has many issues, but it did it's job in that one respect.

&gt;First, that Greek society doesn't have the full blame.

Who else has the blame then? I disagree that it was creditors, because if the Greek people hadn't kept electing such deficit hungry governments then the credit would have gone elsewhere (perhaps more useful private investment and consumption, perhaps not, perhaps another country - to who is irrelevant). Not the Germans, they restructured their economy after being the 'sick man of Europe'. I don't think that the EU was responsible for Greek budget deficits either.

&gt; Aluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science's understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. In our opinion, the possibility that vaccine benefits may have been overrated and the risk of potential adverse effects underestimated, has not been rigorously evaluated in the medical and scientific community. We hope that the present paper will provide a framework for a much needed and long overdue assessment of this highly contentious medical issue.

The second thing that you fail to realise is that we are running a huge trade deficit, this means that money is not staying in the economy and is leaking out to other countries.

&gt;&gt;Ci sono altre spese da mettere in conto? Qualche bollo per aprirla?

&gt;Io ho pagato 61€ per apertura P. IVA + Iscrizione INPS. Ignoro se sia stato tutto guadagno del commercialista o abbia dovuto far fronte a qualche costo.

Non si paga nulla, se professionisti. Nel caso di attività commerciale si è tenuti al pagamento del diritto camerale, che credo sia un centinaio di euro. Quei soldi sono finiti in tasca al commercialista. Solitamente se ti fai seguire da un commercialista si fa pagare al momento di presentazione della dichiarazione dei redditi, se però chiedi solo per l'apertura della p.iva ovviamente ti farà pagare una tariffa.

&gt;&gt;Poi, per dedurre, intendi il toglierle dal calcolo delle tasse?

&gt;Dovrebbe essere così, detrazioni invece le togli dal totale IRPEF da pagare. Però nel regime minimi non paghi l'IRPEF ma un'imposta sostitutiva e non se deduzioni e detrazioni IRPEF valgano in questo caso.

Le deduzioni si applicano sul fatturato. Tutte le spese strumentali, marche da bollo comprese, contribuiscono a ridurre il reddito imponibile, su cui poi tu calcolerai il 5% (perché sei nel vecchio regime dei minimi).",null,0,null,1423403006,null,0,false,0,coey7mg,null,t3_2v6lm1,null,t1_coey7mg,null,t1_coexzt8,null,null,null,null,null,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2,null

Renting cars is expensive here. So is gas. So if you're covering longer distances I'd recommend using trains (unless you're really going from Munich to Hamburg, that's plane-worthy and 30-40€ p.p). Now the thing is, InterCity trains get really pricey unless you book ahead of time, and the regional trains take a long time as they stop at all the little stations in between (meaning Berlin-Hamburg taking either 2 or 4,5hrs). Perfectly fine when staying within the area but a bit tedious for covering distance.

That's right. It did work. Note I didn't say there aren't any structural problems *with the Euro*. Rather, I was saying that there is still no Eurozone mechanism by which fiscal transfers take place. Actions to help Greece have remained on a strictly voluntary basis.

&gt;How does it feel to live in ahistorical bootstrap-land, where external forces of power outside of your control don't shape your personal life and society in a broader sense? Where do I apply for a visa?

I didn't realise that knowingly, and repeatedly, voting for a kleptocratic class of politicians who were addicted to budget deficits amounted to 'bootstrap land'.

&gt;The IMF is renowned for implementing neoliberal 'reform' on every continent under the guise of bringing countries back to 'economic stability'. 

The IMF functions in a very simple way. Bring countries back to a budgetary surplus so that they can pay for their own damn debt servicing. Given the budget deficit went from 13%+, to posting 4% primary surplus', I'd say they've done a very fine job.

&gt;Through racial profiling, northern goverments have created the view of the hard working generous northerner who throws money away on the lazy southern beggar.

Given that media coverage of the crisis often begins with segments of sheep farmers and zorba, I think this must be said to be a largely a true assertion. Call it ""protestant work ethic"" or whatever, there is a pervasive sense among Northern Europeans, of having earned our privilege *personally* through hard work, ingeniousness and high moral standards. 

Similarly, the Greek crisis is understood as something all Greeks have *personally* earned, through absense of hard work, ingeniousness and high moral standards.

This goes to explain a lot of the harshness, Greece and Greeks are met with, not dissimilar to what's being discussed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2v4qfz/til_in_studies_where_random_monopoly_players_were/)

null,false,Naurgul,null,null,null,"&gt; I never said it was fine. I said it did it's job, with respect to not forcing other countries to help a country in crisis. All help was of a voluntary nature, because there are no mechanisms with which to do it otherwise. The Euro has many issues, but it did it's job in that one respect.

So, the eurozone was designed in a way that makes it unstable and the instability proves that it did its job? What kind of backwards logic is this? 

&gt; I disagree that it was creditors, because if the Greek people hadn't kept electing such deficit hungry governments

And if the bankers didn't offer such good deals, no one would take them. It takes two to tango. 

&gt; then the credit would have gone elsewhere (perhaps more useful private investment and consumption, perhaps not, perhaps another country - to who is irrelevant).

It's not irrelevant. The eurozone was designed to induce these capital flows. If the Greek state didn't take them, then the Greek private sector would and it would end up like Spain. Or if Greece tried its hardest to put the money to work in productive investments, it could end up like Germany in 1870 or 1930. Or if it went to a different country, then it would cause a bubble there. 

&gt; Not the Germans, they restructured their economy after being the 'sick man of Europe'.

How the hell does that have to do anything with any blame they might have for the design of the eurozone or with sending these large capital flows? If anything, Germany's ""restructuring of their economy"" proves the opposite: it caused Germany to have a huge surplus which only made the capital flows to the capita-poor countries larger. 

&gt; So who?

The design of the euro for inducing the flows, the surplus countries for running such large surpluses, banks for making irresponsible loans and so on. Plenty of blame for everyone involved.

**Regime dei minimi 2015**

-fatturato annuale entro limiti che vanno dai 15.000 euro dei professionisti e i 40.000 euro dei commercianti. Il limite a cui fare riferimento è stabilito dal codice ATECO con cui si registra la propria partita IVA. Se si supera questo limite di esce dal regime dei minimi e si passa automaticamente all'ordinario.

-coefficiente di redditività: a differenza dei precedenti minimi, il reddito imponibile non viene calcolato fatturato-spese, ma con un coefficiente anche questo dipendente dal tipo di attività. Si va dal 40% del commercio all'86% delle attività immobiliari. In pratica se si fatturano 10.000 euro e si è commercianti l'imponibile è di 4000.

-cassa previdenziale: nel caso in cui si disponga di una cassa di categoria, i contributi vengono versati nella percentuale stabilita dagli accordi. Ad esempio per i giornalisti è il 10%. Se invece non si dispone di una cassa di categoria si deve fare l'iscrizione alla gestione separata INPS, che per il 2015 prevede una contribuzione del 30,72%.

-Sostitutiva: la sostitutiva è del 15% (su imponibile).

-Non si è soggetti al pagamento dell'IVA, agli studi di settore o alla tenuta della contabilità. 

-Non si possono effettuare cessioni di beni o servizi all'estero, e non si possono effettuare acquisti strumentali dall'estero.


**Regime ordinario**

E' un po' più complicato, e rivolgersi ad un commercialista è *necessario*. Al momento, scusami, ma non ho troppo tempo di essere più precisa, comunque in soldoni:

-Sei tenuto al versamento dell'IVA (che ad oggi è del 22%) con cadenza trimestrale o annuale (dipende da diversi fattori)

-La questione previdenziale vale come sopra, ci sono le casse di categoria o la gestione INPS.

-Sei soggetto agli studi di settore, che in pratica stabiliscono arbitrariamente quanto dovrebbe essere il reddito di uno che fa la tua attività. Se dichiari meno di quello che dicono gli studi le tasse ti vengono comunque calcolate sui dati provenienti dagli studi, perché ti considerano un mentitore.

-Per calcolare il reddito imponibile prendi il fatturato e detrai tutte le spese.

-Non esiste sostitutiva, quindi ti paghi tutte le tasse con le varie sigle simpatiche. La più consistente è l'IRPEF, che si calcola a scaglioni. Entro i primi 15000 euro è del 23%, tra 15000 e 28000 è del 27%, da 28000 a 55000 è del 38%, da 55000 a 75000 è del 41% mentre sopra i 75000 è del 43%. Oltre all'IRPEF ci sono le varie IRAP, IRES, ecc. che però influiscono molto meno, e soprattutto possono variare a seconda della regione e di altri fattori.

Per l'ordinario si dovrebbe poi parlare anche di contabilità semplificata, e un sacco di altre cose che però diventano molto tecniche, penso che questo riassunto sia abbastanza per farsi un'idea generale.

&gt;Liebe heute-show Zuschauer,

&gt;in sechs Jahren heute-show haben wir ganz bestimmt nicht alles richtig gemacht. Aber der Fehler, der uns als Redaktion letzte Woche unterlaufen ist, ist mir tatsächlich richtig peinlich. Dass ausgerechnet wir einen TV Clip so geschnitten zeigen, dass er eine junge Frau als Rechtsextreme erscheinen lässt, die sich seit Jahren gegen Rassismus engagiert, hätte nie passieren dürfen. Noch peinlicher ist nur, dass wir erst durch den Facebook Eintrag der betroffenen Frau auf unseren groben Fehler aufmerksam gemacht wurden. Die heute-show vom 6.2. war so gesehen ein echter Schock für Marlena Schiewer und nebenbei noch Wasser auf die Mühlen der Menschen, die ohnehin davon überzeugt sind, dass die Medien notorisch lügen und manipulieren. Wir klären jetzt im Detail, wie genau das von uns ""verbockt"" wurde. Zum Hintergrund: Für die heute-show wird von unseren Sichtern alles was im Fernsehen im weitesten Sinne mit Politik zu tun hat (Nachrichten, Talkshows, Bundestagsdebatten) ausgewertet und in Clips für die Sendung verwandelt. Wenn jemand in einem so gefundenen Ausschnitt gar nicht seine Meinung sagt, sondern andere zitiert, wird das normalerweise explizit dazu geschrieben. Genau das ist aber in diesem Fall nicht passiert. Dafür habe ich mich bereits bei Marlena Schiewer persönlich entschuldigt, und wir werden den vollständigen Ausschnitt selbstverständlich in der nächsten heute-show zeigen. Denn dieser Ausschnitt hätte auch schon in der Sendung vom letzten Freitag in der ungekürzten Originalfassung hervorragend und, was das Wichtigste ist, im Sinne von Frau Schiewer funktioniert. Logischerweise werden wir jetzt sämtliche Abläufe bei uns so ändern, dass sich Vergleichbares nicht wiederholen kann. Es gibt in Deutschland zur Zeit genug echte Rechte die in Kameras sprechen, da muss man weiß Gott keine Linke zur Rechten machen. Auch nicht, wie in diesem Fall, aus Versehen. In diesem Sinne von mir noch mal eine aufrichtige Entschuldigung im Namen des ganzen Teams, und alles weitere gibt´s dann in der Show vom 13.2.

&gt;Liebe Grüße

We happen to be female the both of us and did not order all inclusive due to us not wanting to be stuck in the hotel the whole time. 

One time when we ventured out in the heat to find an ATM these two males started talking to us from across the street. We tried shutting them down quickly to not get any trouble. One of them figured he'd just come across and start following and harassing us. We were discussing in Swedish how to get rid of him as he was starting to worry us. He kept following, making sexual innuendoes quickly escalating and we were feeling less and less safe. 

One of the things we discussed were - shall we just say we're gay? Start holding hands? If he tries to get physical, can we hit him? What will happen to us if we do?!? We quickly ruled out telling him were gay, due to us figuring it would be illegal and really not worth it. Neither did we dare hit him. Female rights in that part of the world is not something I would put my trust in - if I would have any being a female, blond, Scandinavian tourist! 

Finally he concluded that we must be gay due to us not being super happy about his sexual assault. I do think we did agree but were really scared about it too. Nothing came of it for us - apart from finally being rid of the obnoxious guy. 

So no there is no surprise to me as a Swedish female that one could be jailed in Tunis for being gay. And my opinion in relation to this? From what I read there are a lot of countries you could visit that would give you an opportunity to live out all your fantasies - going to Tunis and showing it off would be just plain stupid (that said without knowing any facts of what he actually did do in this case - for my national prides sake I really hope he didn't do that!)",null,0,null,1423404171,null,0,false,0,coeyicw,null,t3_2v6kgp,null,t1_coeyicw,null,t3_2v6kgp,null,null,null,null,null,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14,null

That being said, the portuguese are indeed not like the Spanish or Greek and not that prone to go and protest massively, they rather ""tough"" it out and start growing their own vegetables again on their patrimonial land or head abroad looking for work.

It has not been easy at all for the country, and that is an understatement.

What is more frustrating about this is that Portugal like many other European countries was forced to borrow Greece money for its bailout through the EU, and now risks not seeing that money back. That is money that could have went to hiring back some teachers again, improving public health or securing at least a half decent pension.

Minimum wage in Portugal is not half of that in Greece, this is not a rich country.

After all these years of hardship Portugal is finally ready to take the Irish route, leaving the bailout package early, and I think that is something investors hopefully will notice.

They cut wages and pensions first, then increased property taxes and forced people to sell their houses for next to nothing. They systematically impoverished most of the population, and at the same time cut any social benefits. When people have no money, they cant invest, they can't develop, they can't find work. When you cut someone's pension in half and his medical insurance, you force him to basically die in the streets. How can an economy evolve and improve when no one has any money to invest, and the citizens are ignored in favor of the banks? If citizens have no money, then the internal market eventually collapses and bussinesses close down. It is a futile circle. There are other types of measures, like taxation of the richer and encouragement of investment and creation of better working and tax conditions to attract capital. None of this was even endeavored.

However it was decided that Greeks should not suffer the consequences of their actions (default) because that would supposedly destroy the earth. Obviously I am grateful that we did not default, but we weren't bailed out either. The ""bail-out"" money we were given in the form of a loan, puts us in the same situation we were (owing a fuck ton of money), but now instead of owing the money to banks, we owe it to EU taxpayers, so I don't think the OP is so naive when he says that powerful banks have profited from this situation. They got their money back and suffered 0 consequences for taking the risk to loan money to Greece.

From that point on austerity measures were imposed on Greece. I do not know if they are the most effective way of dealing with the problem, but they seem to have had both positive and negative effects. For those effects (both good and bad) the Troika is responsible. I do not know if the negative effects outweigh the positive, but Syriza (and the Syriza voter) believe they do, and if they indeed do, it is not Greece's fault.

However I agree with most of the rest of what you say, and I really hate it when Greeks blame Germany and past governments and basically everyone but themselves for the current situation.

Okay, I'll try to explain to you, from my perspective, why you're focusing on the wrong thing. Greek voters voted for PASOK/ND for the same reasons people keep voting for bad parties: misinformation and lack of information, media manipulation and pro-government propaganda, fearmongering against other parties. Not only that, but for a long time before Syriza became a player, during the days when the crisis first started and the loans began, the only realistic left-wing option for the Greek citizen was the KKE, which is a full-blown communist party. There were other factors, but the TL;DR is that people treated those two parties as the only parties that had any plan whatsoever. There's also the fact that the average citizen wasn't at all educated about the economics of Greece, because he thought there was nothing to worry about. Most of Greece found out about the crisis we're in in 2009 and had no idea the government had dug them in a hole this deep over the years. So while it seems reasonable to point out now 'well, obviously they would do that', hindsight, as always, is 20/20, and people at the time were being manipulated and misinformed.

Some might argue that it's their fault that they didn't try to become more politically aware. In fact, I agree, in a sense. You don't have to participate in politics if you don't want to, but it's hypocritical not to participate AND pretend to be an expert like people generally tend to do. 

My point, however, is that all this - the explanation you asked for in an article, and the explanation I tried to give you in a reddit post - all this is irrelevant in the current situation. It doesn't make a difference why my father and my roommate's father voted for PASOK in the 80s, because you can't go back in time. Assigning responsibility - or doing the 'blame-game', as is more accurate to call it - is important in teaching the people of Greece (and every country, really) a lesson on the significance and relevance of politics in their everyday lives. But when one's train of thought ends there, like yours does, you aren't doing anything constructive to help the situation. You're simply delegating the responsibility of coming up with ideas to fix this issue to someone else (i.e. ""the Greek people"").   Essentially, you're like a critic in a theater, sitting on the high stands and passively observing as the tragedy unfolds while idly commenting on why it's the character's fault that fate has struck him down. But the character is unable to help himself without your assistance.

The people of Greece have already tried to solve this issue. We snapped out of a 20-year-long reverie, voted a new government and are now waiting with bated breath. The government is also doing all it can - Varoufakis in particular - by coming up with several proposals on how to improve Greece's economy without austerity. In doing so, Varoufakis passed the ball to the EU. And the EU shot every single proposal down and gave him an ultimatum: either accept austerity, thus going back on the people that voted for you, or Grexit. No third option.

And this, in short, is why I think your perspective of 'who is responsible for this' is flawed. First, because assigning blame for past mistakes won't fix the present, and second, because Greece is already trying to revitalize its economy. But the EU prioritizes being paid its due debts over Greece having a competitive economy - which is why they're clinging to austerity even as we're trying to get rid of it.",null,0,null,1423404780,null,0,false,0,coeyogv,null,t3_2v6iy1,null,t1_coeyogv,null,t1_coey278,null,null,null,null,null,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13,null

The formulation presented may not be ideal, because it leaves out one vital part:

That your freedom to do *exactly as you choose* ends when it clashes with the freedoms of another, does not mean you do not get your choice.

What it means that at these intersection points, the choice of which freedoms are most deserving of freedom is a collective matter - it is not reasonably up to each individual because it is logically impossible to grant full freedom to everyone in instances where their choices are in conflict.

One common choice is to want to resolve such conflicts in ways that maximize certain rights, usually starting with the protection of all parties rights to life and liberty. 

And that's where ""freedom"" to refuse your childrens vaccination should end:

By doing so, a parent negatively influence both their children's right to life, and other children's right to life. Their *own* freedom is merely limited to having a right of control of their own children restricted.  

A freedom of choice in one limited area is taken away to protect the lives of others. That's a trade-off we make *all of the time* in all kinds of other situations. E.g. we take away your right to drive when you're drunk. We don't allow you to choose to use violence on others other than in very limited circumstances. 

Parents rights to control over their children's lives are furthermore strictly limited in a huge range of areas exactly in recognition that their children's right to life and to be safe in their person strongly overrides their parents right to take decisions on their behalf. In fact, generally, the purpose of giving the parent a right to act on behalf of a child in the first place is to safeguard the child. 

If a parent chooses to act in a manner that is provably detrimental to the safety and health of a child, then the parent is violating the premise for the right to choose for their children in the first place, and it is a perfectly reasonable choice or a society to opt to act accordingly to choose to protect the child over the freedom of choice of the parent. And we often do. Mandatory vaccinations would be just one more such choice of protecting children from bad parenting.

IIRC Germany was presented as having quite good relations to the natives (in comparison to other colonial powers). 

I also think that a lot of the colonies Germany had at the time were left unmentioned (e.g. the ones in [China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiautschou_Bay_concession) and [New Guinea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser-Wilhelmsland)) in the history books.

THis is laughable. You have unsustainable wage regulations and pensions.

This is laughable as well and only shows serious ignorance of how the economy works, I wouldn't be surprised that you voted Syriza.

I'm just gonna say this: If you don't get vaccines because you don't want to, you're a bad person for putting everyone else at risk. So what nothing's happened to you yet? What if everyone happens to just count on herd immunity? Well everyone would get sick all the time. It's a fact that vaccines work best if everyone gets them. It's a case of everyone sticking together. NOT OPINION. If, say only 50% of a population gets vaccinated, then the likelihood for a vaccine to prevent a disease falls lower, because you're basically developing a hospitable environment for it (the disease). The disease will also have a greater chance of infecting you, and making you ill or killing you (depending on the disease), even if you're vaccinated because of its chance to grow. If 100% percent of a population gets vaccinated, then the disease will have a snowball's chance in hell. Take a look at polio. Do you think it's just magically eradicating itself? 

If you just want to count on herd immunity, but are perfectly suitable for vaccination, you're a freaking moron objectively speaking. There I said it. I didn't sugar coat it, and it's true. Get vaccinated. Tomorrow.


TL;DR: **Get vaccinated. Tomorrow**. Stop hesitating and stop blaming your delay on your upbringing. Everyone's got baggage from their childhood - It's called being a grown up. Welcome to the party. Grow a pair and get your fucking vaccines. Forget what your mom says. It's NOT a matter of opinion. Not saying she's not a nice person.

I still don't have a 100% fleshed out idea of how everything can work, but some early steps I can point to.

(a) The Library model. Libraries are essentially collections of collectively owned items that can be used for free my all members (citizens/people). Book libraries are the most common, but there are also the extremely useful tool libraries and even 'all the things' libraries popping up (e.g. in [Berlin](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/17/berlin-borrowing-shop-benefits-share-leila)).

(b) As I mentioned the Linux/Wiki model. More importantly the licensing of products as 'not for profit'. Licenses such as [CopyLeft](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/) etc. Essentially extending the idea of 'made by non-profit company/tools and only for non-profit use' to products.

(c) The [Valve office working model](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1074301/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf?utm_source=buffer&amp;utm_campaign=Buffer&amp;utm_content=buffer274c5&amp;utm_medium=twitter). Essentially a completely horizontal model of free association of employees with projects within an org. Essentially each employee can choose to associate with any working project (or make a new project and attract other employees to bring it to fruition). There is no higher management to tell everyone how to do things. Everyone is responsible for everything, and all profits of the company get divided depending on peer review (above a relatively low base salary). Let's say a more fluid and 'direct-democracy' workspace

(d) Direct trade / distribution. Primary producers (e.g. independent farmers) often get very low prices because they can't (won't) handle distribution by themselves. I feel we are at a technological level in which we should be making online marketplaces for bulk production in which buyers can directly buy from producers.

(e) DIY and Local Community Organizing. Recreating local bonds with our neighbours (even the asshole old fascist next door) and building local support networks. Planting gardens or veggies in the empty lot or on the roof of our cement blocks (Athens ;)). Helping each other with projects such as moving, building, gardening etc. Potlucks and neighbourhood parties (everyone brings some food and all eat, sing and be merry). Helping working families with e.g.  children studies or babysitting. Get expertise from old people - make their lives useful etc. Free hospitality networks (hosting travellers / immigrants) for as much time as one can and helping them live freely. 

I see networks of people working not for profit as an alternative to capitalism. Some are easier to do and some harder. We can start from the easier ones (keeping online spaces open, getting people to use free alternatives such as linux, openoffice, wiki etc, getting people to explore free education alternatives and setting up free education centers for kids and so on, tool libraries, computer part libraries/recycling, electronics maker spaces, toy libraries, local community building) on to the harder ones (direct trading / no middlemen for food, setting up bussinesses (shops etc) with horizontal no bosses models, producing 'copyleft' items not for resale/profit etc).

As a bottom line, I believe that if capitalism collapses right NOW, we will just have a takeover by fascists and ultraconservatives solidifying around their power structures. In the 'best' case under some pseudo-commie absolutists. Anarchism/Anticapitalism needs to do MORE building of communities in many different ways and building social networks (the real ones not facebook haha) that can support communities based on the principles of non-hierarchy, decency and equality.

Il punto dei vegani, per lo più, è che mangiare la carne, così come possedere schiavi, non è veramente un diritto: ovvero lo può essere dal punto di vista legale ma non lo è dal punto di vista morale, quindi non solo è moralmente sbagliato usufruirne ma è moralmente sbagliato non fare nulla per rimuoverlo, così come sarebbe sbagliato non fare nulla per rimuovere il diritto di acquistare schiavi e limitarsi a non possederne.

&gt;

&gt;Women in [United Arab Emirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates) have achieved some measures of legal protection in recent years. In 2008–2009, 21% of Emirati women were part of the labor force, whereas 45% of [Kuwaiti women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Kuwait) were part of the labor force. 

&gt;Some laws continue to discriminate Emirati women. Emirati women must receive permission from ""male guardian"" to remarry.  The requirement is derived from [Sharia law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia_law), and has been federal law since 2005.  Women in UAE are victims of Sharia-derived judicial punishments such as [flogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flogging) and [stoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoning).

Also, the timing on your preparation might need some revision.

The new Greek government will soon present a new programme focused on reforms like the ones you are suggesting instead of just ""cutting services and benefits"". Again, wanna bet the reception it will get at the Eurogroup?

I don't know which European country you are from, but the last war in Iraq was done by the Coalition of the Willing. Including Poland and the UK, for example. Also we are all part of NATO and coordinate joint defense. Western Europe is a very close ally of the US and has been for the last 100 years. Otherwise they would have lost WWI and possibly even WWII. If not to Germany, then to Stalin later on. Eastern Europe became a very stauch ally of the US right after the Cold War. They pretty much switched sides and are now part of NATP.

Saudi Arabia is also close ally. They are one of the few countries the Tornado fighter jet was exported to, for example. Built by Italy, Spain, UK and Germany.

I don't know if what you are doing is hypocrisy. This depends on how responsible you feel for what your neighbor is doing and thinking. If you personally take responsibility for everything that is going on in your community, then you are not a hypocrit. 

There is no ""right"" to immigration. But you can still be racist and hypocritical by the critieria that you use to ""select"" people that can come.

You can't expect that after such a colossal fuck up, things would be back to normal again after a year of hard times. But Greece has gone from budget deficits of 13%+, to primary surplus' of 4%+. That is a hugely positive development, and indicative that the packages are working for the long term. The issue, rather, is that past governments when presented with targets, have taken easy measures (service cuts and tax hikes) to try and meet them, rather than structural reforms that would actually benefit the economy.

This is absurd. Deficit reduction isn't particularly relevant to the overall problem, debt sustainability. Provided you don't have the necessary stream of revenue to match the interest on the cost of borrowing, reducing the deficit is meaningless. The cuts necessary to achieve this budget surplus has only resulted in a decrease in the growth of real gdp and harmed the overall economy.  

&gt;indicative that the packages are working for the long term.

I'm just going to have to assume this is ignorance. The troika's supposed predictions have been enormously [wrong](http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/paul-krugman-syriza-should-ignore-calls-to-be-responsible-1.2080112) and the notion that their long term predictions will be accurate is just as ridiculous:

&gt;The economic projections that accompanied the standby arrangement assumed that Greece could impose harsh austerity with little effect on growth and employment. Greece was in recession when the deal was reached, but the projections assumed this downturn would end soon – that there would be only a small contraction in 2011, and that, by 2012, Greece would be recovering. Unemployment, the projections conceded, would rise substantially, from 9.4 per cent in 2009 to almost 15 per cent in 2012, but would then begin coming down fairly quickly.
What actually transpired was an economic and human nightmare. Far from ending in 2011, the Greek recession gathered momentum. Greece didn’t hit the bottom until 2014 and, by that point, it had experienced a full-fledged depression, with overall unemployment rising to 28 per cent and youth unemployment rising to almost 60 per cent. And the recovery now under way is barely visible, offering no prospect of pre-crisis living standards.",null,0,null,1423408409,null,0,false,0,coeztsp,null,t3_2v6iy1,null,t1_coeztsp,null,t1_coevxbu,null,null,null,null,null,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9,null

Se invece ci atteniamo ai [fatti](http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/49/executivesummary/default.asp)

&gt;India cultivated a record 11.6 million hectares of Bt cotton planted by 7.7 million small farmers with an adoption rate of 95%, up from 11.0 million hectares in 2013. Notably, the increase from 50,000 hectares of Bt cotton in 2002 (when Bt cotton was first commercialized) to 11.6 million hectares in 2014, represents an unprecedented 230-fold increase in thirteen years.

Uno spaventoso flop davvero. E' tutto documentato.

null,false,Puzzle33,ZZZZZZhirondelle,Hirondelle,null,"To answer some of your questions :  

1/ France is definitely not a very racist country. Sure, there are some racist people, but this does not translate much into the general atmosphere : nothing particular will happen to you because you aren't white, at least if you compare with countries where militias exist, where people can be beaten up or arrested or shot with everyne one around acting as if this was normal.  
There is mostly casual, unconfrontational racism, and I'll argue this exist because of general ignorance instead of deliberate villainy.  

Obviously, if you base your opinion on internet comments, where anyone will spew anythnig out in complete anonymity wthout even having to think about the issue, it will seem a lot more preponderant.  

Of course, these comments are sickening, but there are almost never any substance behind them. We are a latin country after all : we'll speak loudly, with a lot of exagerrating, but most of these people will never make these comments in real life because they'll be shut down immediately. 
Only a few people will act upon this kind of feeling, but they are largely considered insane or mentally ill by the general population.  

Regarding the rise of the National Front, it's mostly a trompe-l'oeil. In reality, less people vote for the National Front than they did in 2002.   
What's happening is they win elections now because a lot of people have stopped for the other parties, which we perceive as intensely corrupted (they're not more than in any other western countries, but we find that untolerable). And since they now win elctions, the media talk about them when they did not used to.  

Of course, you should par that with the facts that the others main parties (PS and UMP) love this uprising because it is supposed to mean that if the FN enters the second round of elections, their opponent will be backed up by those who don't usually vote for them as a barrage  against the FN.  
This is evolving, because everyone is getting tired of this scheme which maintains the statu-quo.  

2/Nothing ""controversial"" gets you arrested. Only things that go against the law. There are few exceptions to freedom of speech, and they're all against incitation to violence or racism. The immense majority of the French agrees completely with that. 
Before the Charlie attacks, a law was passed against the apology of terrorism, and it is being largely put to the test in the wake of this event. Jurisprudence will likely give it a much more refined definition.  
No censorship here.  

3/ Oce again, racism is largely in talks and internet comments, not in action. If anything, people are getting aware of this problem and are wanting to erase it, and that's why racists are doing the most right now. But it is oh so tame if you compare with any other western country where people can get publicly humiliated or beaten up without anyone batting an eyelash.  
There is  a bit of xenophobia, but once again, largely in talks. In reality, anyone is most likely to want to know more about foreign countries and will engage in conversations with foreigners.   
There is more control against immigrants, we have to deal with people wanting to join England, and this is an issue which a lot of associations are currently tackling with. We haven't found the proper attitude yet, but it could be worse.  
Economy-wise, it could be worse too. We like to exaggerate about it, and it could be better, but generally, our successes tend to fly under the radar. 

And about civil liberties, you've got to be kidding : people have the right to remain silent of course, being arrested for ""suspected crimes"" has to be court-ordered and a Court can only order this if a number of very precise conditions are met. 
Both the Police and the Courts are under very strict control. It's not 100% perfect, but I would not exchange them for any other in the world. The organisation is fine, only corruption can make it awful.  

Privacy laws are getting increasingly worse, I can agree with this. But since there are not enough people employed to check through all the data, we're still alright.  

I don't know, there sure are a lot af things to change and things we want to get much better, but it seems to me that you have a very distorted notion of what France is actually like. In fact, I would like to know where you are getting your information, because the results are certainly spectacular.

During the war:

--Raw materials and food were requisitioned, and the collaborationist government was forced to pay the cost of the occupation, giving rise to inflation. This was further exacerbated by a **""war loan"" which Greece was forced to grant to the German Reich**. This ""loan"" was **never paid back** and severely devalued the drachma.

-- By the end of the Occupation it was estimated that **the total population of Greece was 300,000 les**s than it should have been because of famine or malnutrition.

-- It is estimated that the overall **loss of life due to the war was 13% of the Greek population**.

-- **Mass executions, rapes, and burnings of whole villages.** Just google Distomo, Kontomari, Kos , Kephalonia, Kantanos, Kerdyllia, Kalavryta, Kommeno, Zakynthos. *Remind me one such atrocity commited by Greek people.*
 
After the war:

-- **Greece's infrastracture was completely obliterated**. Power stations, airports roads had been destructed.
 
-- Italy repaid to Greece its share of the occupation loan, Italy and Bulgaria paid war reparations to Greece, and Germany paid war reparations to Poland in 1956 and to former Yugoslavia in 1971. Greece demanded from Germany payment of the occupation loan in 1945, 1946, 1947, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1974, 1987, and in 1995. However, **Germany is consistently refusing to pay its obligations to Greece arising from the occupation loan and war reparations.** In 1964, German chancellor Erhard pledged repayment of the loan after the reunification of Germany, which occurred in 1990. Of course, it has never been paid back.

You say you didn't have it easy, but take a look at the above and tell me if these results should belong to a victor of WWII and **a country that was the whole time on the defensive.**

&gt;The discussions in /r/europe...

Nowhere did I mention reddit's discussion on the matter. In my quest to understand the politics of the country I live in (DE) I am reading newspapers and watching a lot of Phoenix, ARD and ZDF. Discussion on these public channels is in the vast majority respectful and grown-up. I specifically excluded Bild and other tabloid media.

What is the real political discourse if not Guenther Jauch, the shows on Phoenix and Die Zeit?

&gt;Who? Greece will soon ask for something like this. Wanna bet what the reception will be?

The first reaction will probably be ""the publicly, European-held debt is not your problem, payments only start in 2020"".

&gt;Again, wanna bet the reception it will get at the Eurogroup?

The Eurogroup has a vested interest in Greece becoming economically successful again. Do you think this some kind of Germanic plan to lower domestic bond yields? If so it's a very stupid one, considering the public backlash and the substantial financial risk.

It just so happens people have different opinions on the best course of action. I know, crazy.

&gt;If what you say was true, then such a programme would be received with praise and readily adopted. The reality is that it will be dismissed immediately because ""Greece needs to stick to its commitments"".

Depends on the program. Finally collecting tax from wealthy people and corporations will be welcomed by all. The same goes for fixing the property registry and taking harsh steps against corruption.

&gt;That's the reality of the situation. 

The reality of the situation is that Greece doesn't have any money to spend. All of the programs will have to be financed by European money.

Except that it *worked*. Greece has a primary surplus, their GDP bubble has deflated, they have low interest rates and long maturity on their debt, they can pay down their debt, 50% of privately held debt was written off, they are at a start of a growth curve (or were until this new government got in).

When a country has pumped up a big GDP bubble with tons of debt, and has 30% of the workforce in the public sector with ridiculous 50% higher salary than the private sector, and then people stop lending you more money, there is no solution that doesn't include pain, suffering and massive unemployment.

&gt;The 'structural problems' of the euro weren't structural problems

No. That's *exactly* what you said. But okay, squirm out of it if it makes you feel better. I say 'surplus recycling mechanism' in line with Keynes, you say 'fiscal transfers'. We're effectively talking about the same thing - surplus states within the monetary union transferring funds to deficit states in order to plug deficits and promote economic development. The fact that this doesn't exist *is a structural problem with the Euro* which is the shared currency of the monetary union. Arsing around with semantics just makes you look like a silly prick.

 If you actually believe that 'actions to help Greece remained on a voluntary basis', we're so far down the rabbit hole, I don't even know... Did you not read anything I wrote about how heavily German banks were leveraged in relation to shitty foreign capital? There was nothing voluntary about the arrangement, the Germans *needed* to organise the bailouts in the 'southern' countries to prevent the collapse of their own banking system. This is not overly complex, try to wrap your head around it, love.

&gt;I didn't realise that knowingly, and repeatedly, voting for a kleptocratic class of politicians who were addicted to budget deficits amounted to 'bootstrap land'.

Only if we accept your infantile caricature of the Greek populace lining up to ""knowingly, and repeatedly"" vote for a ""kleptocratic class of politicians"". Obviously the Greek people are morally bankrupt scum who deserve everything they get, according to your position. Clearly the issue of how people in a young democracy with a weak economy attempt to make choices when faced with systemic corruption, imperfect information and any other number of negative factors can be reduced to a neat little narrative of 'they knew what they were getting themselves in for'.

Do you deliberately try to condense things down into the most simplistic, unsympathetic and harsh way you can - or is that just something that comes naturally? 

&gt;The IMF functions in a very simple way. Bring countries back to a budgetary surplus so that they can pay for their own damn debt servicing.

Thanks for ignoring the context. I'm seeing a pattern here. Great job ignoring the alternative method for debt restructuring that I raised too. 10/10.

Was relevant war ist, dass Schüler die nicht daran teilnahmen zum Teil offensichtlich oder eben auch subtil benachteiligt wurden, und das schon damals.

Es gab z.B mehrfach Marathonläufe um Spendengelder für Afrikanische Schulen zu sammeln. Zuallererst fanden die meisten Schüler das auch sehr gut. Aber diese wurden dann immer häufiger veranstaltet und einige Schüler machten darauf aufmerksam, dass es auch andere Probleme in der Welt gibt, ja und sogar im eigenen Land (Kranke Menschen, Tiere, Obdachlose usw). Ja, sogar in der eigenen Schule (Denn die war marode).

Es gab also irgendwann Schüler die anfingen sich zu weigern an den Aktionen teil zu nehmen, weil sie sich missbraucht fühlten immer für den selben Zweck aktiv zu werden ohne vorher gefragt zu werden. Dazu zählte auch ich. Dies blieb nicht ohne Konsequenzen. Ich wurde im Unterricht benachteiligt, man hat mich nicht mehr dran genommen wenn ich mich gemeldet habe. Man hat mich als Nazi diffamiert weil ich beim dritten Lauf nicht mitgerannt bin, da ich gerne mal für einen andere Zweck gelaufen wäre (Kranke in Deutschland, Obdachlose in Deutschland)... das wurde mir recht lange nachgehalten unter dem Motto ""Du bist nationalistisch eingestellt"".

Sagen wir mal so, das ist einer von hunderten Beispielen. Ich könnte ein Buch über meine Schulzeit in dieser Stadt schreiben. Aber es geht nicht nur um meine eigenen Erfahrungen, in Gesprächen mit Freunden von anderen Schulen bekam ich heraus, dass dies auch gängige Praxis war in anderen Schulen in unserer Stadt.

Davon ab wurden Schüler auch politisch indoktriniert. Das passiert halt wenn der Lehrerdurchschnitt aus Linken, Grünen und SPD´lern besteht.

Bezogen auf die Aktionen.. Ich fand sie zu beginn gut, ich konnte was gutes tun und das mit meiner damaligen lieblings AKtivität ""Sport"". Nur wenn das zu einer politischen Aktion ausartet, da war ich als 16 Jähriger schon schlau genug um zu sagen ""Halt stop, es gibt auch andere Probleme"".

Davon man ab... sowas sollte generell freiwillig sein. Gut, unter dem Deckmantel lief das auch immer, aber wenn es Konsequenzen gibt, wenn du nicht mit machst, sei es auch nur in subtiler Form, inwiefern ist es dann noch freiwillig? Zum Glück haben sich später Eltern zusammengetan um dagegen anzugehen, auch meine Eltern haben mich unterstützt. Gebracht hat es wohl nichts, das muss ich nun 12 Jahre später feststellen auf Reddit :)

&gt; ""Das war eine Zwangsveranstaltung für uns Schüler. Ich musste da hin und meine Anwesenheit wurde überprüft!""

Ja auch damals schon. Das wurde dokumentiert ob du bei einer Demo oder Aktion warst.

Bezogen auf die Toleranz Demos... Oh je... auch da kommen Erinnerungen hoch. Das war schon vor 12 Jahren ein ganz großes Ding in den Schulen.

Wenn ich irgendwo nicht teilgenommen habe, dann deshalb, weil ich damit zum Ausdruck bringen wollte, dass ich freiwillig entscheiden muss, an welchen Veranstaltungen ich teilnehmen möchte. Je mehr dagegen angekämpft wurde, desto mehr habe ich mich aus trotz geweigert, weil das meinem Freiheitsgedanken wiedersprach was da ablief.

Um es auf den Punkt zu bringen. Du durftest natürlich freiwillig mitmachen zu meiner Zeit, aber wenn du das nicht getan hast, dann wurde es aufgeschrieben und die Nachteile waren Monate lang spürbar indem dich Lehrer ignoriert haben, diffamiert haben usw. Ist das freiwillig? Ich glaube nicht.

Eh? In GDP terms (typical measurement of ""largeness"") the UK's still [well below it's 2007 peak](http://i.imgur.com/VC3g6xv.png). Where are you getting your facts =/?

And of course in GDP/capita PPP adjusted, probably the most relevant measure, it's [fared worse again](http://i.imgur.com/mnc8jyo.png) - seeing as the population's larger now than in 2007.

&gt; and more people are in work than ever before.

Well, at least this fact is true. Amazingly, less stuff is being produced then before, but hey - more people are working for it.

&gt;Also, your 20% figure seems like junk economics too me.

3% growth over 7 years is 23% alone. 23% on the 2007 figure would put GDP **30%** higher than it is now.

&lt;Ein Beispiel: In der Panorama-Sendung vom 17.10.2002 wurde der ""Evangelische Kindergarten"" im württembergischen Neckarwestheim gezeigt. Dessen Kosten zahlt aber nur zu 17 % die Kirche, was für kirchliche Verhältnisse sehr viel ist. Denn bei den Kindergärten ist der kirchliche Eigenanteil an den eigenen Sozialleistungen mit Abstand am größten. Den Rest übernimmt aber auch hier die Stadt. Deren Bürgermeister Mario Dürr sagte dazu: ""Normalerweise sollte ja das außen drauf stehen, was innen drin ist; und innen drin ist eigentlich Gemeinde – zu 83 %. Also müsste eigentlich genau genommen ´Gemeindlicher Kindergarten sponsored by Evangelische Kirche’ drauf stehen."" Im Landesdurchschnitt von Baden-Württemberg zahlt die Kirche gar nur sieben Prozent der Kosten ""ihrer"" Kindergärten. Kirchenexperte Carsten Frerk nannte das in der Sendung folgerichtig einen ""Etikettenschwindel"". Tatsächlich gibt die Kirche nur etwa 8 % der Kirchensteuereinnahmen für öffentlich-soziale Zwecke aus (siehe Recherchen von Gerhard Rampp vom Bund für Geistesfreiheit in Augsburg).

I really do. I don't buy the sentiment that Greece was somehow fucked over. A wise philosopher once said that government is the illusion by which everyone seeks to live off of everyone elses expense. That illusion is clearly very strong in greek society and as a result, government paid out unsustainable amounts of benefits for an extremely long time and borrowed purchasing power from the citizens of other nations to sustain this. After the collapse of this clearly unsutainable system all I see are massive numbers of people rioting over the dismantling off it, people like OP who blame germans, banks and the IMF for the crisis or people like the golden dawn who instead blame immigrants. I really do symphatize with the few sane voices in this madness, it must be really hard.

You seem to have this idea that banks are completely separate from you. The recapitalization of the banks didn't went to you? What do you think would have happened if the banks were not recapitalized, do you think you could have claimed your deposited assets or do you think all assets would be frozen and devalued to match what was really there? you know, you can only cook the books for so long - when people start calling the bluff the house of cards topples.

Look, I'm not pro banks in particular. I have a general disdain for large corpoartions because of their involvement with the government. Like a wise man said, when one gets in bed with government, one must expect the diseases it spreads. Banks are tucked down deep with the government and therefore I'm always cynical about banks. This is not about banks though. The Greek situation is because a large majority of people in greece feels entitled to other peoples labor - primarily other greeks - and continue to vote for whichever crook promises to take the most from their neighbour and give to themselves.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Papandreou#Economic_policies

&gt;The expenditure programme of the Papandreou government during 1981–1990 has been described as excessive by its conservative critics.[30] The excessive expenditures were not accompanied by corresponding revenue increases and this led to increases in budget deficits and the public debt

&gt;During its time in office, Papandreou's government carried through sweeping reforms of social policy by introducing a welfare state,[18] significantly expanding welfare measures,

Pretty much Him and Andreas Papandreou despite being ideologically different from eachother both ended up doing actions that raked up their countries debt.

Reagan decreased taxes but didn't cut spending like he promised, and the deficit/debt went up.

Papandreou increased spending like he promised and the greek debt went up.

Subtitles are indeed very good to learn the original language, but claiming they destroy the movie more than dubs is more debatable if you take the point of view of someone who doesn't speak the original language at all.

There are more things about a movie than the movie itself, there is also what it makes the watcher feel. Subtitles allow the audience to experience the original speaking performance of the actors, but foreign watchers won't understand it and have to read a much flatter written translation, which is just as inaccurate and sometimes much worse than the translation offered by a dub, as everything is toned down.

Dubs replace the original speaking performance of the actors, but if done well can offer a translation that will often be more lively and also often more enjoyable for the watcher, and can even become necessary for some movies where speaking subtleties are very important and where subtitles would take a lot out of the movie.

If you don't speak the original language, there will be tons of things lost in translation, that's a fact. Subtitles and dubs are different types of translation that both have their ups and downs. One is more respectful of the original product, the other can be more easily enjoyable for the average foreign watcher. That's it. The important thing is that people should have the choice to chose the type of translation they want.

No, it's not like that. People learnt french as an american or brit would learn spanish in school, that is, pretty badly (even worse than in those countries even, since the education system was and is broken and most kids can't utter a propper phrase).

&gt;Besides, southamerican countries get their fildmed dubbed in their own language. At least on the bigger countries like Mexico.

2. As I pointed out there were many other similar things going on. The US, and probably the UK, has done several operations over the last decade on foreign territory.

That the Eurozone was designed with the intention of causing capital flows from rich countries to poor countries. The crash that followed was a direct consequence of those flows. Therefore, you can't say really say that it's all Greece's fault. 

&gt; that Germany somehow enforced a law that smaller economies had to take German money

Nope, everyone agreed to it. 

&gt; Or that wage growth in Ireland was not unsustainable? 

It was very unsustainable. 

&gt; Or that Irish banks were not completely over-leveraged?

They were very irresponsible. 

&gt; but other countries did just fine (Austria, Netherlands..)

The countries that didn't crash were the countries that were the source instead of the destination of the capital flows. 

&gt; Don't ask me, I am not head of the state of an economically weak country. If I was, I'd certainly not lead it into an economic union with one of the most competitive economies there is.

And they shouldn't have. But they thought the flows would be a nice boost for their economies and didn't realise that they would be a burden in the long run. My point is that without the flows the eurozone would not even be conceived in the first place. 

&gt; However, it is not like we held a shotgun to their heads. The Euro zone mostly was a French invention to keep Germany on the leash, but this backfired.

But yeah I see what you're saying and Portugal isn't alone.From what I understand that's one of the major problems in the current negotiations.Giving more money or time or whatever the Greek government wants isn't going to look good in the eyes of the voters in other EU countries and the politicians aren't willing to take the hit so we may have reached a dead end.

Greek newspapers and sites are like ""Merkel this"" or ""Schauble that"" but I think they're just expressing the will of their people.

Not unrelated. 


Your people and you if i follow what you just said. Protested against government cutting spending. 

Which is fine, but then again there isnt really a point because a lot of the money didn't came from industries to prop up the greek government, but from borrowing from foreign sources since 1981.

Japan has a 200% debt ratio but nobody is complaining about them  because most of their debt is owned by japanese nationals buying their own countries debt out of national pride despite not knowing if they will be paid back. But although japan is stagnant *nobody is talking about them reaching crisis mode with their debt as they do with greece*.

So no matter how many leftwing slogans you shout, it doesn't change the fact that 

1. Greek government doesn't have the money to give them anymore.

2. The money the protesting greeks thought the government had was just borrowed money

3. Nobody else was willing to lend to greece so they could keep inflating their house of cards/castle built on sand with the name 'GREEK GOVERNMENT' 

4. Greece doesn't have the money

5. Austerity didn't make your economy rebound to where it was before but it was necessary because beggars can't be choosers and if the other EU countries wanted to reinflate your government borrowing bubble then they would of used 5 times more euros then they did for you but obviously they didn't because otherwise it would mean their own taxpayers have to use even more of their money to bailout the greeks who built their economy on sand/cards. by paying even more taxes and using more of their pension funds to bailout an irresponsible country.

In the case of the government, of course they were not fucked over,they won elections on a platform of ""there's money"" and afterwards feeding of the fear of the public that if we dont vote for them we will default. Many people are equally responsible, in the sense that they borrowed money that they shouldn't have and indeed lived luxuriously at others expense. This happens everywhere. 

Now in our case, the problem starts with the fact that the government passed some decisions illegitimately, forcing us to take more money from the IMF, which enforced a program that is not only objectively wrong (they even had the audacity to publicly announce that ""oops sorry, our calculations were wrong""), but also gave all this money to the banks. No, it is not necessary to capitalize the banks, as was the case of the Lehman Brothers. Or if you must, make sure that the banks will in turn have to suffer the burden of the debt, and not the weakest members of society. The measures targeted people with already low wages, low income and no financial security. 

I have said this before, there are two ways to deal with a financial crisis, one was the austerity measures that resulted in poverty, hunger, massive unemployment, the actual growth of the debt by about 50% of the GDP,and the default of many bussinesses.

The other would have been a repackaging of the debt among with the debts of other countries and a creation of a bond to be sold in secondary markets, also the creation of a Eurobond, to ensure proper security and low interest. Then an implementation of proper measures that welcome capital, like low bussiness taxation and low interest in government bonds. 

It is criminal for a monetary institution to implement a policy that they later blatantly admit was wrong, and destroy the lives of so many people irreparably. They are the ones that should have known better, and not a majorly uneducated public. In that sense, we were fucked over indeed. It is never a solution to simply borrow more money, when you are already in debt.

Back in 2010 it was never about greece, it was always about spain, italy and portugal. If greece would have defaulted there was a huge chance that at least one of those three would have been in deep deep trouble as well. So there was never a choice to not do something for greece. That's also why the ""help"" from back then is causing problems now. That help was never meant to really fix the problems of greece, it was meant to protect italy, spain and portugal.

The situation in 2015 however is exactly the opposite. Those three countries started reforms and look stronger now, so a greece default isn't that dangerous anymore to them. Now its quite the opposite, if greece gets another bailout the eu is sending a message to italy and spain that it's cool to not pay their debt, that they don't really have to continue with their reforms and so on. And that is what merkel is most afraid of today.

Greece defaulting as an isolated incident wasn't a problem for the eu back then, and sure isn't now. There is no blackmail leverage there. The problem right now is that merkel can't really risk helping greece because of the consequences that might appear in italy and spain. And from how fast Syriza changed the way they talk it seems that they got that message really quickly.

Well you said this first

&gt; At least here in Spain it's because many people don't know english, since under Franco's regime french was mandatory and the state lagged severely behind on english implementation.

Which seemed to imply that the spanish people didn't knew english because they knew french.

Besides, if they knew any of the languages subtitles wouldn't be necesary. Knowledge or not of foreign languages by the general population have nothing to do with the decition to dub a film or not. Its merely economic and/or protectivism.

&gt;I disagree... spanish doesn't need to be protected belive me... In fact, the catalan film industry is suffering a lot due to the cheaper films in spanish and so there aren't almost any films dubbed in catalan (and the few that exist are pretty terribly done) so it's either spanish in the cinema or watch it home, and it's pretty sad that I can't watch films on my native language or the original version (though if you scratch a bit you can find a cinema that does english films... rarely)

French people have laws to protect their culture and language that may seem too far fetched to us. Here in Catalunya when there was money, dubs were subsidiced with public funds (which was okay with me). Anyway, I don't find particulary depressing that not many films get translated to catalan, since, at least, they are arriving in a language I can understand (Spanish or English, if you use... er..

&gt;My problem with doublespeak 

Drop the Orwellian terms. It doesn't make you look clever. We ascribe meanings to words, just because you disagree with something doesn't mean it's 'le dubble speek' and you have the key to the *true* meaning of things.

&gt;No one in the world argues against the need to cut spending when facing bankruptcy. No one in the world argues against the need to balance the budget when facing bankruptcy and they are unable to borrow any more money. 

Except the Greek economy isn't comparable to a business or a household facing bankruptcy; so stating your asinine position again doesn't actually move the conversation any further, refute, or even address my criticism of this position.

&gt;So, people like you avoid arguing it altogether, so instead resort to doublespeak and emotional bullshit excuses to avoid actually fixing the problem. 

The irony is just delicious.

&gt;Once you beam down to reality and factor in the fact that you already are dealing with massive sovereign debt and not a single soul in the world is willing to lend you a penny more, you are then forced to face the fact that cutting spending is not only an inevitability but also a pressing need.

Well, let me come down from my magical looney leftwing spacecraft and tell you that the issue of Greek sovereign debt is a little bit more complex than you're trying to portray it. The Troika is lending money on the basis that Greece 'balances its budget' - as if this absurd statement is the very key to economic growth; even in spite of everything we've seen since '08. Whilst Greece is the debtor in this relationship, they possess a significant amount of power by virtue of how indebted they actually are. Nobody wants to see Greece declare bankruptcy - much less the creditors who have lent billions on the basis of expecting *some* return at some point in the future. It's in *everybody's* interests to restructure the Greek economy - we're not at a point where ""not a single soul in the world is willing to lend you a penny more"" as you seem keen on portraying it. To use the old cliché, if you borrow €50,000, it's your problem but if you borrow €50,000,000 it's the bank's problem. We're well beyond the point of this just being a Greek problem.

&gt;Therefore, as this is politically inconvenient for you to admit and you are unable to argue against it

That projection. I can feel it burning through the screen. I agree - 13% deficits aren't sustainable (unless you're a global hegemon like America, but that's a different point), but the difference between you and me is that I'm not stupid enough to advocate that the way to fix the problem is to pursue a series of short-sighted numerical targets which result in leaving the economy as a burnt husk of its former shitty self.

For me, this robes the movie of its athenticity entirely. If I watch an amercan heist movie it is essential to me that it is

a) american english with all those slangs and a certain intonation we would never use in Germany and

b) it is actually Pacino talking in ""Heat"" or ""Donnie Brasco"" because HE is the cop or wise guy NOT the voice actor.

Rent can be expensive. Be sure to watch out for realtor commissions at 2.38 times your monthly rent (provision) and the high deposits (3 months cold rent). This means your first months rent is actually 6.38x the posted rent once the dust settles. You can apply relocation funds to the provision if you have to, and any uncovered moving expenses, plus the cost of installing curtains and lighting are tax deductible, so save the receipts. 

Unfurnished means no lights and often no kitchen, although Hamburg is better for kitchens these days. You will have to pay a TV tax of around 17€ per month, per household (split with roommates). Owning a tv or not changes nothing. 

Taxes are high if you are single. Married, with kids and the social benefits more than offset them. 

Groceries are reasonable, as are transit costs and day to day living. 

1 month is probably not enough time to find a place in Hamburg. Be prepared to spend 3 months or more of you want a unicorn (provision-free, cheap, okay commute)

It's worth seeing if your company will hire you a renters' agent. (Makler) Plenty of landlords don't speak English, and it can mean the difference between getting the place you want. 

For neighborhoods, look in Eppendorf, Eimsbuttel, or the Portugesenviertel if you want good central neighborhoods. Saint Pauli can be okay, but watch the proximity to the Reeperbahn since the noise will be loud. Sternschanze is a more liveable version of that.

Western powers recognized Kossovo's right to self-determination, but they won't recognize the same right to Crimea. The Russians are hypocrites in mentioning Kossovo (Russia contains ethnic minorities itself), but they are also right about Western hypocrisy.

Like I said elsewhere, 

&gt;In Kosovo, intervention stopped ethnic cleansing and systematic, documented abuses, while peacekeepers kept the peace for nearly a decade while the now de-facto independent authorities in Kosovo consistently attempted to negotiate autonomy within Serbia under the supervision of the EU. Serbia refused to allow any concessions, so independence was declared after nearly a decade.

&gt;In Crimea, masked Russian troops with no insignia unilaterally invaded to ""protect"" against completely fraudulent and imaginary oppression of ethnic Russians, while severely curtailing non-pro-Russian media, kidnapping journalists and international mediators, occupying the Crimean parliament with hundreds of armed men. Then they staged a referendum three weeks after the invasion with no attempted negotiations with Kiev, and offered no option on that referendum for anything less than independence.

&gt;Kosovo was a decades-long process of peaceful negotiation and attempted compromise to find a solution after massive human rights violations. Crimea was a sham referendum held three weeks after an illegal invasion based on completely fraudulent pretexts, all with no negotiations of any sort. There are clear and obvious differences.

It's only hypocrisy when looked at it in an overly simplistic manner.

null,false,Selbstdenker,EURO,European Union (Germany),null,"&gt; We're not asking for money. The EU is trying to forcefeed us more money because it's the right move for them - we're trying to avoid that because the Greek people don't want to be subjected to even more austerity. What we're asking for is the opportunity to develop our own economy.

I will not argue that the EU is doing the best for you. But nobody is forcing you to go their way. Just declare bankruptcy and see what happens. I just doubt that anyone will be giving you money because nobody will expect to see it again. I still do not see any change in Greece. You had a lot of money to develop your own economy but you did not. What has changed? Have people started to pay taxes?

I know this is harsh but I see Greece on the brink of being a failed state.

In retrospect, I wish we would have done nothing for Greece. The EU should have created a fund to prevent the written off Greece debt crashing Europe and taken money to soften the crisis in Spain and Portugal (and probably also Ireland). 

&gt; Oh, also...

&gt; &gt; They will just use the money to continue and then scream for more.

&gt; I just vomited in my own mouth.

I am sorry but this is not going to change my mind. I do admit that I am not very informed. I do not care that people collect pensions for dead or that Greece has a higher disability rate (I am not even sure if that is a real problem, might be as well on par with other European countries including Germany). But I do have a huge problem with people not paying taxes (and I was told by Greeks back in 2007 that tax evasion is a major problem in Greece). And I read enough stories about the unwillingness to change that.

If you think you can change my mind there, feel free to go ahead I am open minded.

Do not get me wrong. If I would believe that Greece has truly changed and would use the money for good, I would be all in favor for doing so.",null,0,null,1423415277,null,0,false,0,cof2qa5,null,t3_2v6iy1,null,t1_cof2qa5,null,t1_cof1mlj,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

This is entirely bullshit.

The only ""austerity"" there has been in Portugal was tax increases, stopping all public-private partnerships, and implementing a series of exceptional, one-off, temporary taxes (""solidarity contributions"",they named it) to increase the tax revenue.

The EU/ECB/IMF loan was then used to refinance and restructure the sovereign debt, which reduced the cost of serving the portuguese debt, thus contributing to reduce the deficit.

Subsequently, the last 4 years have been used to slowly reducing the deficit (a primary surplus was only achieved last year) while essentially keeping all public investments (i.e., public works) on neutral.

You forget that the language carries a cultural meaning: literature, idioms, even rural traditions are carried out by the language and that's the beauty of watching films in its original language! You get to see something which is usually wrecked when dubbing. 

So being able to see a film in catalan (not only that I prefer the language because its my mother tongue) conveys also the cultural barrage behind it (Gamarús, tros de soca! I miss the good ol'e days of Super 3) that something like an spanish film wouldn't cut it for me, and when not dubbing isn't an option, catalan gives me a fuller sense of immersion, if done correctly, than spanish, because it's more ""natural"". Sadly this isn't common, since spanish dubbings are waaaay more comercially sound and its pretty rare to find a catalan dub, even rarer if it's good",null,0,null,1423415826,null,0,false,0,cof2zwn,null,t3_2v6n49,null,t1_cof2zwn,null,t1_cof266n,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

**Außerdem: Milch ohne Bio-Siegel stammt oft von Kühen, die ihr ganzes Leben lang kein Tageslicht sehen.**

Die Modernen Milchviehställe und besonders die in der Massentierhaltung sind heutzutage meist an einer Seite offen damit im Stall ständig frische Luft und für die Kühe ein angenehmes Klima herscht damit sie auch ihre Leistung bringen können. Hinzu kommt das im Modernen Kuhstall sich die Kühe in der Gruppe frei bewegen können anstatt wie früher ständig angebunden zu sein da die kosten für diese Anbindehaltung viel höher sind als die Gruppenhaltung. Die letzte große Neuerung durch die Melkroboter ist aber das die Kühe jetzt selbständig zum Melken gehen können und nichtmehr 2 mal am tag zum Melken getrieben werden.

I still don't buy the idea that the Eurozone was invariably set up to channel money from a set of countries to another set. It could have occurred to anyone that those countries that regularly devaluated their currency would have to undertake quite drastic reforms - ideally they should have stayed for a long time in an incubation phase where devaluation is no longer allowed but they have not yet adopted the Euro.

The whole idea of setting up a currency union without the corresponding political/social integration (read: German money transfers, southern wage cuts and european monitoring of government spending) was moronic and every country is to blame for it.

For example, English to Italians sounds monotone (as in, not much variation between high and low tones of the voice) so the language will always feel not emotive and expressive unless you're really used to it and are able to pick up the phonetic clues, which, again, are completely different. To be able to do that you need a kind of proficiency that makes the need for any kind of translation moot. So those kind of subtleties are lost.

Second of all, you're assuming that dubbers aren't actors themselves and that they aren't actually better than the original. So many movies with flat delivery caused by terrible actors (pretty much every Matt Damon, Kevin Costner and Keanu Reeves movie) were greatly improved because they were dubbed by experienced theatre actors who actually knew what they were doing. Arnold Schwarzenegger sounds ridiculous in English. I could hardly keep a straight face while watching Terminator 2 in  original. In Italian he has a deep, gravely voice that fits the character perfectly (the same VA dubbed Goliath in Gargoyles, imagine Terminator with the voice of Keith David *shivers*). 

A good artist always realizes that a translation, if done well, is able to create a new work which can be just as good, or even better. When the VA for Woody Allen died, he sent his condolancies because he knew that a big part of his success in Italy was due to Oreste Lionello's outstanding performance. Kubrick had a hand in localizing his own movies and even chose personally the sentence that Jack wrote obsessively on his tipewriter in Shining for every version. Why? Because he knew that no matter how good you think you are with a language, art speaks with certain sensibilities that aren't translatable, no matter how hard you try. So that's where the magic of a great translator comes in and changes just enough so that the meaning gets across but is able to reach different cultures (case in point, the famous *here's Johnny*, which would be completely meaningless to Italians).",null,0,null,1423417822,null,0,false,0,cof419q,null,t3_2v6n49,null,t1_cof419q,null,t1_cof1fee,null,null,null,null,null,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4,null

**Donnerstag**  
Beine trainieren am Morgen, vertreibt Kummer und Sorgen. Abends war ich dann auf den Geburtstag einer Freundin eingeladen, war relativ chillig.

**Freitag - Sonntag**

Hoffe ihr hattet alle eine schöne Woche, was sich auch bitte in der nächsten Woche fortsetzen soll!

Klingt kompliziert, ist es auch wahrscheinlich. Man hat ja immer schöne Idealvorstellungen! Aber ich würde euch alle gerne einladen, vorbeizuschauen und gerne euch zu beteiligen. Mag es auch ein bisschen trocken sein, ist es doch auch das Ziel, trockene Informationen und Fakten aufzubereiten.

null,false,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,null,"Like every other country, French history has its own uniqueness which influences the political debate.

The pre-Front National far right movements got much of their steam from historical events like the Algerian War in the 60s. See things like the [OAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_de_l%27arm%C3%A9e_secr%C3%A8te), but also, perhaps more relevant to the Front National, the [pieds noirs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied-Noir), who are the French/Europeans from Algeria, and their descendants, who had to leave the only country they knew, Algeria, and come back in the millions to France where they weren't well greeted. They have strong family tragedies and tend to be quite conservative, and parties like the Front National seemed to be the only ones who cared. Imagine if the Afrikaans had left South Africa in the millions to come back to the Netherlands.

French culture is also divided between the ultra-progressives, who more or less rule the political elite since 1968, and the conservatives who are the backbone of the far right, and hold considerable influence, notably in Catholic circles. One may think of groups like [Action Française](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Fran%C3%A7aise), and early thinkers like [Charles Maurras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Maurras).

French society is also influenced by a strong sense of independence, when it comes to foreign affairs, through the influence of Charles de Gaulle. The far right at his time were opposed to Charles de Gaulle of course, but nowadays with globalization and whatnot, mainstream parties seem to deviate quite a lot from that, and the Front National less. Also, of course, there are issues with immigration, insecurity, unemployment and whatnot.

Now you can add the very real fact that Jean-Marie Le Pen, the creator of the Front National and its leader up until the 2000s, is an excellent speaker. He's pretty much recognized by even his enemies as being an excellent politician, and some have said he's one of the greatest masters of the French language amongst the political class. The far right in France has seen some internal dissent, but nothing the Front National's very charismatic leader couldn't handle. The Front National was later ""blessed"" by the fact that Le Pen's daughter, Marine Le Pen, is also a brilliant debater, and she did ""inherit"" the party, though I think she deserved it. No one else could have elevated the movement as much as she did. She has the fame of the name and the party, and she's good at what she does. She also manages to give a more presentable face to the party.

It's important to note however that the Front National is probably not as extreme as you may imagine it to be. Today, it's not like the BNP, or like Golden Dawn, but more akin to UKIP or Geert Wilders in the Netherlands. Nowadays, the Front National rallies electors (and occasionally politicians) from the mainstream, from disillusioned communists to conservatives, including seculars, Jews, and homosexuals worried about Islam, and farmers to patriots concerned about the EU.",null,0,null,1423418591,null,0,1423419953,0,cof4g4b,null,t3_2v6p7a,null,t1_cof4g4b,null,t1_cof3hw1,null,null,null,null,null,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7,null

Good for you and thanks for keeping the level of debate above the usual mud-slinging.

[But it was.](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/economy/95989/eurozone-crisis-debt-dont-blame-greece). That's the point of financial market integration. 

&gt; It could have occurred to anyone that those countries that regularly devaluated their currency would have to undertake quite drastic reforms - ideally they should have stayed for a long time in an incubation phase where devaluation is no longer allowed but they have not yet adopted the Euro.

That would have been a great idea, but our politicians decided to go down the flashy route of making the euro an irreversible currency. If a lot of members were only in the euro as a peg, that means they would be able to leave at any time. But anyway, your idea already existed: the ERM peg system existed long before the euro.

&gt; The whole idea of setting up a currency union without the corresponding political/social integration (read: German money transfers, southern wage cuts and european monitoring of government spending) was moronic and every country is to blame for it.

You can't just make an assertion like that without backing it up. I can simply assert that you can, but we're no further along in the discussion. Wages have already been slashed, how far do you want them to fall? The minimum wage is ~€680 per month. Who exactly do the Greeks need to be 'competitive' with? The French? The Irish? Because as it stands the minimum wage is already half of what it is in the aforementioned countries. Maybe the Turks? Or maybe the Chinese. It's the fabled road to Bangladesh. Low wages aren't the key to economic development - if they were, Bangladesh would be a fantastic place to live.
