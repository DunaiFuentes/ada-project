They said that would lead to huge inequalities and crisis.

The cash they got is from the taxpayers of Europe - to live within their means. It's been slowly but steadily working for Ireland, however Greece is different and obviously has a very different set of internal problems, problems that they are not addressing

In fact, it's become easier for a certain portion of Greece to blame the creditors for their problems rather than look in their own back yard at their own failings. This is what the Venezuelan and Argentinian governments have been doing for well over a decade, blaming their problems on other countries, boogeymen and entities, but never truly tackling them

Likewise, the world can throw all the money we want at Greece, forgive all the debt they want.. there will always be problems unless the Greeks tackle the underlying issues

Much in the same way we could keep donating to certain African countries and it would all end up going down a black hole, no matter how much cash was injected

It's a two-way deal, Greece just can't sit there and expect to be given all the cash and debt relief they want, they must do something in return.. and so far they've shown they cannot manage that

This is exactly because there is no possibility for start-ups i.e. small companies to grow into larger ones.  And there is no accumulation of capital, the essential ingredient to augment labour's output.

The overwhelming example for small businesses in Greece is the small family-run shop, restaurant or hostal.  Don't confuse small cornershops with start-ups.  Any poor, agrarian economy is going to also have a high percentage of ""self-employment and companies of fewer than 10 employees"".  I'm not saying Greece is still a poor, agrarian economy anymore but those of us who are a bit older will remember that it was exactly that in the 80s when Greece joined the EEC.  

Compare this to, say, Italy, which also has a big bureaucracy but a very strong entrepreneurial culture based on saving and re-investing: family businesses in Italy grow into worldwide brands: Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Piaggio, Moto Guzzi, Benelli, Ducati, Gucci, Prada, Benetton, Salvatore Ferragamo, Miu Miu, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Ferrero, Saclà, Barilla, De Cecco, the list goes on and on...

I hope I did not offend you by doing so and if I did I sincerely apologise. You are entitled to your views and to express them as you see fit (Subreddit rules permitting as for everybody else). But I am going to criticise the arguments put forward.

Your argument was that people wouldn't vote for Rivera because he was Catalan and that his support would drop once they realise his origin. Everybody knows where he is from with his accent, the origin of his party and his name. You are entitled to have whatever views you have, including about what Rivera is doing. He may well be a liar, a PP look alike and a unionist. People in Ireland regard such unionism as a betrayal of our nationalist ideals. But accusing the rest of Spain of bias towards Rivera because he's Catalan seems far fetched at least. They will probably end up hating him/not supporting him because of support for the PP. 

I'm going to read this study that Esquerra keeps citing. But at a glance it seems pretty incorrect. The states with the largest fiscal deficits in the U.S. are small, relatively rich ones on the East Coast like Delaware (20% of its GDP) or New Jersey (14%). One of the reasons for it is the poverty of other parts of the country such as the South with federal money going there (you can see more about that [here](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/which-states-are-givers-and-which-are-takers/361668/) ). Then of course there are those from national newspapers like El País. Are we not supposed to believe them at all?

As I said before I am in favour of Catalan fiscal autonomy and the right to decide. But I am sick of nationalists using this argument and the insults in Catalonia towards people from poorer parts of Spain that go with it.

So even the ones they have already agreed to, which would greatly benefit the current situation, are on hold until a deal is reached. 

Why is that btw? To my understanding, this is actually self-imposed by Tsipras. I have heard vague arguments about how they think that would somehow diminish their bargaining leverage, but I don't follow that. Tsipras must be aware that one of the big problems in the negotiations was trust; with all the backpedaling that happened by him over the months (and previous governments too), the troika just didn't have a lot of trust in noncommittal promises. It seems to me that, had Syriza passed some of these laws on its own (since they are a good idea economically either way), it would have fostered trust and thus probably loosened other demands made by the troika. It also would have made a possible debt cut much more easy to sell to the European public if they see Greece is on the right track. The way it looked from the outside, Tsipras didn't really want to implement any of it, and would throw it overboard the moment the new deal was passed and money started flowing.

I think the younger person that stopped was maybe 40 years old, and they old told me the same! they use to do it when they were young, and it's a shame that it is lost now. But the young people are the ones that NEVER stop, and will tell how dangerous it is. I think it's easy to make it safe with just a couple of things, and i really think that hitchhiking IS the best way of traveling around in a place you don't know. I have done it in almost every continent by now and i will never regret this. I actually lived 8 months in new zealand just hitchhiking, living in a tent, fishing, and doing odd jobs.
Thank you for taking the time to write, it made me happy to read your comment, and i hope hitch hiking won't die, and that hopefully there will always be people ready to stop and give someone a hand, and maybe have  a wonderful experience I still keep in touch with lots of people who helped me, and i got to help them back in a few occasions).",null,0,null,1436030514,null,0,false,0,css3cao,null,t3_3c1fxc,null,t1_css3cao,null,t1_css2tnl,null,null,null,1437582529,null,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1,null

Almost nobody wants to give the EU the right to have a real fiscal budget with the right to borrow. 

Somehow everybody believed that a closer union would happen automatically in a crisis. Well, guess what  - the opposite happened. Every country was on its own and was forced to reduce its automatic stabilizers if it was struck by crisis, which deepened the recession.

All of this was known long before the euro was introduced. American economists warned of those asymetric shocks. Nobody listened.

Now, we are stuck with an incomplete union and a currency that will be destructive until we either dismantle it, which we can't since announcing that would be devastating economically, or complete the union which nobody wants since it means that huge sums of money would be transfered from the stronger members to the weaker ones through automatic stabilizers.

null,false,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,null,"&gt; Yes, it is true that countries have, in terms of numbers, been in worse situations, but the internal economy of Greece has already been decimated by the austerity measures. I'd be surprised if you were to find a business which isn't struggling (or hasn't already gone bankrupt).

I'm not sure you can claim that ""the internal economy of Greece has already been decimated by the austerity measures"" as opposed to the recession(s) which austerity is both the result of, and a response to.

Greece has austerity because nobody will lend to them except official lenders, and official lenders won't lend as much to them as they would like to borrow in order to keep the Greek economy functioning as it was pre-recession. That's fundamentally all austerity is, and its true alternative is even deeper austerity.

As such, stating that ""the internal economy of Greece has already been decimated by the austerity measures"" is basically false. The internal economy of Greece has been devastated by the recession(s) in the Greek economy along with Greek government's inability to access as much funding as it needs to keep the internal economy of Greece running as it did up to then, or to reform the Greek economy to that it can be sustainably prosperous without such borrowing.

Calls for the troika to ""end austerity"" are calls for the troika to lend as much money to Greece as the Greek government feels it needs, or, since that would increase Greek debt, either to allow a default on the money Greece owes them so that Greece can go back to the markets and borrow as much as it feels it needs - or to allow a default on the money Greece owes them now, and then lend them as much as they feel they need.

There is no other way to ""end austerity"" as such than to allow Greece unlimited borrowing, because austerity is only the inability of the Greek government to borrow whatever it wants to paper over the hole in the accounts.

In turn, the ""pro-austerity"" viewpoint is nothing more than the view that the Greek economy as it is currently isn't able to be prosperous without unlimited borrowing, and that therefore if the Greek government is able to borrow limitlessly, then sooner or later we will all be here again, so it's better for everyone, Greeks included, if the Greek economy changes to make itself capable of sustainable prosperity.

But if your whole cultural system disintegrates, say the way it did in Greece where everybody wants an easy living with no work and a lot make believe and fraud and what have you, then the Keynesian stuff won't work. So what happens is all this intervention helps if you have a lot of merit, a lot of credit in the bank so to speak which you've earned by deserve it.

The 2014 [Corruption Perceptions Index](http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results) from Transparency International lists Greece at 69th of 175, with a score of 43. What's your point?

&gt; You don't know if he is a fool or not.

I judge him by his words.

&gt; Indeed our leaders wouldn't find any battle, since their solution to everything is ""tax the people, doesn't matter if they die"".

Great leaders to have then no? You're reinforcing my point.

&gt; Now, I need some evidence that Germany is dominating the EU policy, that Germany leads the EU.

The German GDP is 40% exports, which is an artificial anomaly created by manipulating policy. Germany has been running  &gt; 6% surpluses for the last 5 years and counting, which has the effect of suppressing other countries exports. 

German surpluses mean the German govt doesn't spend, on infrastructure and investment projects, or social spending, which means that excess tax revenue helps to suppress demand. Germany has also been surpressing its wages internally. 

All of the above mean that its policies have an inhibitory effect on the rest of the EZ to grow and compete with it. 

Likewise, Germany's power and influence in the EU mean that policies which might have helped the peripherals grow and eventually compete with Germany never happen, and those countries never prosper. Austerity is key to this strategy. 

 I mean Germany is supposed by the rules to be fined 1% of GDP this year and every year after for those surpluses. Why have they not?

&gt; Greeks were never forced to take the money and no one is forcing them to go into austerity, they followed the recommendation of their creditors because they wanted to and were greedy for more money.

This is a trope people fall back on when their arguments are beaten. 

In fact, Greece was insolvent in 2010. What happened was that the 'assistance' Greece was offered was not an assistance to fix or restore Greece, but instead to prevent the EU from having to bailout all the banks exposed to Greece. The extension of loans was never intended to benefit Greece. Greece was instead the sacrifice. 

They deserve the courtesy of the acknowledgement that they were the ones who saved Europe from its own destruction, not punishment for it.

&gt; No one can impose something to Greece, but they can institute certain terms and conditions if Greece wants something from that someone.

This doesn't justify offering conditions that are acknowledged by the Creditors themselves to be insufficient and further harmful. Saying Greece must accept the terms if it wants the money doesn't justify requiring destructive and vindictive change to fiscal policy. 

It's especially suspicious when such is masqueraded as being 'reform'.

&gt; In terms of cuts we got it harder

No you didn't. Greece is an order of magnitude worse. See below where I provide a couple of resources to support this. I picked some easy to find and read articles. If you want more substantive stuff, google it.

&gt; Anyway, you can't really quantify the impact austerity has on people.

[Here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/23/austerity-failure-1-chart_n_3639674.html) and [here](http://www.vox.com/2015/7/1/8871509/greece-charts) are great summaries of the changes created by austerity.

And yes, you can quantify the impact of the policy. In the number of suicides. In the number of homeless people. In the number of people living below the poverty line. In the number of people experiencing famine. In the number people with no jobs. In the number of people forced to emigrate. And on and on and on.

All of those numbers are way, way worse now than they were in 2010. If they weren't Greeks might have some hope. Ask Greeks now what hope they have and see what they say. This is even true of those who plan to vote 'Yes'.

&gt; greeks got used to a higher standard of living and coming down from what they think is normal and take for granted is harsher.

This from a former communist country who had nowhere to go but UP when it came aboard. Our project in Europe is not intended to bring Greece down to your level, it's intended to bring you up to its. And it's intended to bring EVERYONE up to the standards of its creditors. 

But of course it can't do that, intentionally, because the Creditor nations, of N Europe, are manipulating the EZ economy to keep from having to compete with S Europe.

There is always a tendency for the media to be centralized more and more to the most powerful people. Or according to the propaganda model this is the first filter: medium ownership. 


As for whether you can get killed or no, of course the situation in Russia is tragic under a totalitarian regime. As I said though, the west has evolved more sophisticated methods of censorship.And of course there are several cases in the west where journalists are being detained without any real reason, simply for scare tactics.  

Usually, the information source is centralized like in [USA](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/10/leading-german-journalist-admits-cia-bribed-leaders-western-press.html) or [Europe](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/10/leading-german-journalist-admits-cia-bribed-leaders-western-press.html) and simply report it uncritically such as in the Iraq war.

This means, without any ""haircut"" the original creditors lost the remaining years of interest payments (e.g. if there were three years remaining, they lost around 40% taking into account inflation). The reason why they were eager to make the deal was of course that the alternative meant Greek bankruptcy.

For Greece it meant that instead of having to pay 100% after three years, and 15% each year in between (at 3% inflation that's worth about 138% of the principal),  Greece now has to pay 3% for twenty years, and 100% after twenty years (at 3% inflation that's worth only about 95% of the principal).

[In a five-page proposal presented to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in Brussels Wednesday, EU/IMF lenders asked Athens to scrap welfare benefits for low-income pensioners and disabled people, cut pensions by 1 percent of GDP beginning as early as July, privatize the Public Power Company and regional airports, and scrap early retirement as soon as possible. They also demanded that Athens hike consumer taxes in order to raise some US$2 billion (1.8 billion euros). This would include increasing the value-added tax on medicines to 11 percent (currently set at 6.5 percent) and electricity to 23 percent (currently set at 13 percent).](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/EU-and-IMF-Demand-Greece-Cut-Pensions-Renew-Austerity-Measures-20150604-0021.html.)

And what you really should do is compare the absolute amount of debt in € 2010 vs 2015, not as a % of GDP. Because the GDP in 2010 was still inflated from free outside money that was going to dry up either way, austerity or not.

Google IMF Riots and see what comes back.

Also note: the IMF wants a different policy for Greece than is being negotiated by the EC. The IMF is campaigning for Debt Relief--which is a smarter position at least than the EC. Still harmful, of course, but at least Greece gets out from under the mountain of debt. 

&gt; The notion that Troika policies are aimed at harming the Greek economy? Ridiculous.

Really? Then why is Greece worse off now than it was 5 years ago? And subsequent to that, why is Greece being asked again to accept the same policies that made the situation worse over the last 5 years? This, btw acknowledged BY THE IMF in documents sent to Greece, and in a report released yesterday.

Since Creditors know they are asking for policies that harmed Greece when accepted last time, and are likely to do so again, by their own estimates, how can you say the policy *isn't* designed to harm Greece?

Devi avere un po' di pazienza, puoi comunque chiedere agli operai se il sabato possono evitare i lavori rumorosi o farli in stanze non vicine a dove devi dormire.

Only as long as someone else is paying. The IMF doesn't believe in debt relief enough to provide it themselves.

&gt;at least Greece gets out from under the mountain of debt.

the debt is not Greece's problem. it costs them less than 5% of GDP per year.

Greece's problem is that government spending is higher than its economy can afford, and that nobody wants to start a business, because wages and taxes are too high, because the bureaucracy is shit, because there is no way to plan ahead due to constant legislative changes...

&gt; Then why is Greece worse off now than it was 5 years ago?

Because they suck at reforms.

&gt; why is Greece being asked again to accept the same policies that made the situation worse 

If they had implemented them back when they were asked the first time, they wouldn't still have to implement them.  They also wouldn't be in such a mess.

&gt;What's a delusion is you not seeing how the trade disparity and austerity party is maintaining a completely unnatural environment which benefits some and harms the rest.

Look at Latvia! I guess Latvians are just more disciplined, more rational, more mature than Greeks.   Latvia could do the reforms. Latvia came out ahead within five years.

&gt; L’identità sessuale
&gt; Gli studi di genere non negano l’esistenza di un sesso biologico assegnato alla nascita, né che in quanto tale influenzi gran parte della nostra vita. Sottolineano però che il sesso da solo non basta a definire quello che siamo. La nostra identità, infatti, è una realtà complessa e dinamica, una sorta di mosaico composto dalle categorie di sesso, genere, orientamento sessuale e ruolo di genere.

&gt; Il sesso è determinato biologicamente: appena nati, cioè, siamo categorizzati in femmine o maschi in base ai genitali (a volte, però, genitali ambigui rendono difficile collocare il neonato o la neonata nella categoria maschio o femmina, si parla allora di intersessualità).

&gt; Il genere invece è un costrutto socioculturale: in altre parole sono fattori non biologici a modellare il nostro sviluppo come uomini e donne e a incasellarci in determinati ruoli (di genere) ritenuti consoni all’essere femminile e maschile. La categoria di genere ci impone, cioè, sulla base dell’anatomia macroscopica sessuale (pene/vagina) e a seconda dell’epoca e della cultura in cui viviamo, delle regole cui sottostare: atteggiamenti, comportamenti, ruoli sociali appropriati all’uno o all’altro sesso.

&gt; Il genere, in sostanza, si acquisisce, non è innato, ha a che fare con le differenze socialmente costruite fra i due sessi. Non a caso nel tempo variano i modelli socioculturali, e di conseguenza le cornici di riferimento entro cui incasellare la propria femminilità o mascolinità.

&gt; L’identità di genere riguarda il sentirsi uomo o donna. E non sempre coincide con quella biologica: ci si può, per esempio, sentire uomo in un corpo da donna, o viceversa (si parla in questo caso di disforia di genere).

&gt; Altra cosa ancora è l’orientamento sessuale: l’attrazione cioè, affettiva e sessuale, che possiamo provare verso gli altri (dell’altro sesso, del nostro stesso sesso o di entrambi).

A me tutta quella parte su come il ""genere"" non sia innato, ma si acquisisce, sembra esattamente quello di cui si lamentano in molti e che viene talvolta, sfortunatamente, propagandato nelle scuole. E' vero che minoranze irrisorie, credo sull'ordine del 0.7% della popolazione, hanno disfunzioni di genere ma non a caso sono definite come disfunzioni. Sono errori nel cervello, nel tuo sviluppo. La stragrande maggioranza delle persone il suo genere c'e l'ha innato eccome, e coincide con il sesso alla nascita. Quindi, cercare di normalizzare qualcosa che normale non è, è una stronzata politicamente motivata.",null,0,null,1436035439,null,0,false,0,css5t17,null,t3_3c3d14,null,t1_css5t17,null,t1_css5g9t,null,null,null,1440500567,null,0,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,0,null

&gt;The rest of the private foreign creditors transferred their balances to the EC balance sheet,

They didn't just transfer the original contracts to EC (i.e. ECB/IMF/EFSF) balance sheets. If that were the case, Greece would be paying 15% interest on its debt. Greece is not paying 15% interest to the EC, it's paying 3%, in some cases 0%.

Instead what happened was:

- the EC gave Greece new loans, at ridiculously good conditions, as explained in my previous comment.

- Greece then used that money to pay back the original private debt (which was at brutal conditions).

The decrease from 15% interest to 3% (as well as the extension of the payback date from three or five years to 20+ years) was a huge reduction of the debt, and it applied to ***all***(ALL) of Greece's debt, not just to the few remaining private domestic lenders.",null,0,null,1436035527,null,0,false,0,css5ums,null,t3_3c36u9,null,t1_css5ums,null,t1_css503i,null,null,null,1440500588,null,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5,null

In terms of *public transport*, yes. Road quality is *good* relative to the national level, and in many cases surpasses a lot of places in terms of traffic being low, since it's relatively calm. Easier to commute up north than down south, that's for sure. IT-wise infrastructure isn't a problem, and nor is cellular coverage.

&gt; long distances

In jest: boohoo! ^I ^kid! The longer distances are in many cases irrelevant, as you'd spend right about the same time getting to the various things you need if you take into account traffic levels down south (south being more east, but I'm not sure if you're referring to *southern* Norway, or *sørlandet*).

&gt; bad cities

This needs to be elaborated on: saying they're bad is something, but what in particular drags them down? I'll be the first to say that you won't find the same level of diversity in activies up north, but hey: find me a Norwegian that attends all of the full range of activities by the diversity offered in the metropolitan cities and I'll be impressed! Norwegians seem to be that whether they're in Oslo or Tromsø, they seldom go for being a full time jack of all trades.

Worthwhile mentioning how while housing are magnitudes cheaper up north, the wage difference isn't remotely as high as the housing costs? If I want to get a home where I currently live, I'll need to spend around 9,5 mil. NOK if it's to be a normal sized apartment for me and my cohabitant. Up north, where I'm from, I can get a home for 500k NOK and I'll spend less time every day commuting, with less traffic. ^^Except ^^for ^^moose ^^on ^^the ^^road.

&gt; shit weather

Right now it's shitty, but that greatly depends on the season! Seeming as you're from the north, I'd imagine you know this better than most! :D We've had great summers and shitty summers, just like down south. Plus, we have midnight sun -- and that's something I absolutely love every damn summer I spend up north. However, is it cold and sucky right now? Yes.

&gt; lack of jobs

This definitely can be the case, although if you live nearby a city it's not the biggest killer. Unfortunately it's a bit of a chicken-and-the-egg situation, but I'd look at the economic growth in the northern cities, and take into consideration that just moving south doesn't solve anything there. The *major* (Norwegian context here) cities are either stable or increasing in population, while it's the district areas that die out. Here you're more likely to find people commuting, and as such it's still not much of a problem, but certainly: niche jobs with specialist academic backgrounds will be more challenging, but that's not something that *the south* solves. For your niche, specialist academic background you'll most likely need to go to the niche, specialist regional area where it applies.


What is a bit lengthier than intended is not to say that the north is on par with the south in terms of exports, nor necessarily growth. However, I'd hope it is a slight chance that I could convince you that the regional situation isn't remotely as black and white as you seem to have imagined, especially not when you say it's better in pretty much every way.

If you care so much for poor Greeks, raise taxes in Greece.

There are poor people in Greece, yes, but there are also wealthy people in Greece. If you want to compare who is the poorest and most hungry, Greece will not ""win"". There are very many wealthy Greek people, more than in Bulgaria or Slovenia, who if the Greek government were to tax them, could finance fair pensions for the rest. Greek pensions are to high, cumulative, not the lowest class.

No one prevents the government from capping pensions at a €1000 or 1500, so that everyone can get a fair pension. It is not fair to ask the rest of Europe to pay for it when you do not want to pay for it yourself, or get rid of early retirement yourself.

*Again the same mistake? Not at all.*

*In fact, the story is simple, and journalists are wrong.*

*The région PACA has ordered some trains with the greatest possible capacity, with the objective to travel into France. The manufacturer naturally takes the norm of the standard French tunnel size for having the most space possible. The région PACA then said “oh these trains are nice, what if we send them to Vintimille?”. Vintimille is in Italy, so the tunnel is not covered by the specifications. Therefor construction work is planned for improving the tunnel up to the international standards (it is an old obsolete tunnel).

* ""an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident, institutional units engaged in production (plus any taxes, and minus any subsidies, on products not included in the value of their outputs)

I am aware that the IMF, The World Bank and The CIA Fact Book use slightly different calculation for GDP -- but the differences are too insignificant worth mentioning with this discussion.

&gt; With all the hubris that that entails when you use coercion and deception to justify the ends. Those are assaults on people's freedom in true sense of freedom of choice via freedom of information and freedom from ignorance as much as freedom is job security, food security, health security etc etc... that prosperity provides. 

Please, you're acting like every citizen in the eurozone was a dumb puppet. Yes, the building of the Eurozone was flawed (economically), but this doesn't mean that people didn't want or liked/like the euro. That brings me to the second point, if the EMU is truely a political project, then prosperity is not the only thing that matters. It also matters how the citizens feel about it. And most eurozone countries are pretty ok with the euro. If the rposperity part is lacking, then it shoudl be either fixed or broken up, depending on how the people feel about it. (Is our trade more important then the convenience of the Euro, its symbolic value, etc.)

&gt;as well as the democratic test.

So, in the end, your argument against the euro is also the argument people use for more unification: the coin must be controlled by one electorate, which would mean either drastically more union or break up the euro.

&gt; It's a solution to a problem that was already being made redundant around that time, and post-internet is even further redundant but the cost of throwing more political capital after the bad continues to grow as a consequence of the deception employed on people and the vacuum of power that the EU has opened up within Nation States.

Ok, yes, i get it, we are all dumb puppets of the eurocrats. Our opinions and feelings do not matter at all.

&gt; This sounds ambigious

it does, because the EU can mean many things to many people, good and bad.

&gt; What influence does the EU exert in how many many varied ways to many different policy areas affecting people in many diverse ways?

I suggest you take a course on EU-policy and learn about the theories? but i think you already did do that to some extent. you seem educated enough for it.

&gt; I'd suggest that actually the EU has spent a lot of money on influence to market itself as the above is probably the best fit to the truth attempted to be expressed above?

Has the EU done that? I think they're trying to get a good media presence, that's all. The EU as a political institution has done a lot of amazing things which most peole kind of take for granted. Besides that, most of what the EU does i generally boring stuff (kind of like the IRS in the US), so it has to come forth to show its value as an institution in the media.

&gt;  the above is probably the best fit to the truth 

I am always reeaaaaaaaaaally sceptical when people start talking about THE truth in complex matters as these. This is A truth: your truth. There are many arguments to be made (a few of which i countered above) on either side. F.e. that the UK can prosper more outside of the EU than inside, that is very possible, but that doesn't mean this counts for other countries as well. This doesn't mean other countries want this. And this doesn't mean the EU is an evil overarching institution that forces the people of Europe to do its will.

No they didn't and this is obviously part of the reason why we're in this Syriza mess in the first place.

&gt; Bourgeois is the term for the upper class that bases its position on wealth alone

Depends of the century and I know the meaning quite well ;) However, in this context Greek bureaucrats have turned themselves into a modern landed gentry. Jobs are passed based on connections. Universities to some extent act as social welfare for the wealthy kids. The fact the even the PM position was kept inside a small number of families (dynasties) is quite alarming.

Tsipras studied civil engineering, but AFAIK never actually worked anywhere. He became a politician straight in the university. His friends have similar backgrounds.

Greece lost 30% of its GDP, Portugal lost 5-8%. Greece went through the largest fiscal adjustment in modern history which closed the 14% deficit to 1% surplus but it ended up destroying the economy as 30% of GDP was lost and GDP/Debt soared as the denominator which was the GDP completely crashed. 

It is not black and white either, I will not say Greece has not been at fault, ofcourse it has. But I don't understand the complete inflexibility to make a good long-term deal for Greece considering the circumstances of losing 30% GDP. Varoufakis/Tsipras have constantly proposed an ""Austerity-lite"" deal with the Troika and 90% of ""red lines"" Syriza made when they won office have been crossed to try to make a deal, yet the creditors want to continue harsh austerity while there is 60% youth un-employment. 

The creditors could make a deal like Germany received Post WW2 and tie debt repayments with export surplus and the entire crisis could be solved instantly . .yet they have made no attempts to reach a middle ground to promote growth and at least some ""hope"" for the Greeks, especially young people. 

Greece has managed to cuts its 14% deficit into a surplus, pay back all debts since August 2014 with zero outside assistance and create a complete reform package which was rejected even though almost every single ""Red line"" was crossed, there should be at least some form of compromise but this is not about debt or economy any more. It is a pure political war since Syriza poses a danger for the establishment EU parties.

To extrapolate: Although people can *see* the name of the organisation next to the link, they may not be familiar with its biases or whatever. The landscape of news sources is ever changing and you can't expect every individual in the subreddit to be aware of all the various news organisations, as they come and go. It would make sense to make the mod team singularly responsible for making people aware of that by tagging. 

Secondly: I think that whilst it might lead people to say ""Of course the DM would say that""... it is a legitimate point to make, and it is worth being discussed in the individual article. It will lead people to find alternative sources to verify the information, and also to contrast it with other pieces of information that the DM (or whatever organisation) did *not* include in their own article.

&gt; Nichtzusammenarbeit mit der Polizei kann hier auch kosten. Zwangsgeld nennt sich das.

Das ist aber etwas anderes als für das Twittern eines Demoaufrufs 1000€ Bußgeld zu bekommen. Zudem ist Zwangsgeld wohl auf 25.000€ beschränkt... hier gibt es Strafen bis zu 600.000 €. Summen, die wohl nur der Abschreckung dienen. 

&gt; Das Verbreiten von Photographien von Polizisten kann auch hier illegal sein.

Kann. Muss aber nicht. Größere Menschenmenge und z.B. Demonstrationen sind durchaus erlaubt. Es ist wohl erlaubt ein Video einer Polizeikette zu filmen, nicht aber einen einzelnen Polizisten. Auch hier besteht ein Unterschied zum Gesetz in Spanien, was pauschal Ordnungsgeld vorsieht.

Der Kritikpunkt ist - und das IMHO ein guter und legitimer Kritikpunkt, dass du wenn du eine Demo anmeldest oder zu einer Demonstration gehst, durch diese Gesetze sehr schnell in die Gefahr kommst richtig viel Geld loszuwerden. Unabhängig davon ob man etwas illegales macht.

Output per hour worked in France was roughly on a par with Germany and just below the US. In the league of the world’s seven most advanced nations, Britain is behind every one except Japan.

Over the past two decades, French workers have, on average, been 20 per cent more productive than their UK colleagues. But the gap in output per hour worked has grown wider since the crisis. While labour productivity in the UK in 2013 was exactly where it was in 2008, in France it rose by about 3 per cent.

It's well known that Christoforakos was the man of German intelligence agencies. The scope of his role was much bigger than bribing politicians for Siemens. There are announcements from the Greek justice system that correlate his identity with the Vodafone spying scandal, Mitsotakis family + bribes, military deals under the table. Also, there are rumors that he had an important role in the plan for the assasination of the former Greek PM Kostas Karamanlis.

The details don't really matter in his case. What is crystal clear is the fact that he was responsible for bribing many Greek politicians in order to make them obedient to German interests. There are several people who believe that this is how Germany *persuaded* the Greek politicians to vote everything the past 6 years (despite the fact that those measures would slowly kill Greece).

I'd like to say that I think the really interesting bit is the distinctions between privately owned propaganda sources and state owned propaganda sources. 

I'd say that Fox News and the Daily Mail are quite possibly worse than Russia Today and almost certainly worse than Al Jazeera. Therefore, I think we should definitely find a way of including private propaganda in the list. 

One possible way of doing this, is by looking at the organisation itself and determining to what extent it is journalistically independent of its owners. The Sun is owned by the Murdoch press and there's a famous alleged event where Murdoch went into the Sun offices and ranted that they weren't trying hard enough to stop Ed Miliband from winning. So the Sun is obviously not very independent of its backers. On the other hand, the Guardian is owned by a special trust which prides itself on journalistic independence, and the journalists themselves often decide by voting on what their collective journalistic stance is to certain issues (such as elections). 

There's nothing wrong with having *a view*. Everybody's got a view. More specifically, they've all got an *ideology* or a *Weltanschauung*. That's fine. But what's not okay is when their ideology is being determined not by rational discourse and thought, but by vested interests.

We're then talking about people or things that are already well known. Regardless I'm just trying to say that in many ways I agree with you. Now and back then... but there's a reason most people in the thread when it was first mentioned agreed with it. (I was rather doubtfull because I couldn't think of a good way to execute it other then maybe trough courts which are already overburdened with silly stuff at least in my country &amp; it would still create a big mess for the sites involved.)
Most agreed with it because the core of the idea wasn't bad which you then equate to this proposal for which I can't find any redeeming factor.

&gt;the difference there was that the legislation only applied to the UK, the right to be forgotten applies to every country in the EU. 


Yes but I don't see the difference this difference makes. The EU parliament decides on specific stuff for the EU. The Benelux parliament in the Benelux, the Belgian one in belgium, the Flemish one in Flanders, my ex on everything I did.

What's the point? If the EP has a fuckup sure this puts a blemish on the EP. (I wouldn't consider the subject of this thread a fuckup btw) Should we drop it because it has a wider reach? (in terms of size not legislative power) Should we then treat the UK the same and drop it too for the more localised governments, etc. City councils maybe.

I see what you mean if the EU was some kind of full fledged federal government or even now it should be held to a few higher standards. But when it comes to something like this we're not talking a higher standard. We're talking about the same standards every government should go by.
This proposal is silly. I don't see the problem as long as it remains just a proposal by some random woman or guy but I find it equally stupid whether it pops up in the EU or in my country.

null,false,RubiksCoffeeCup,null,null,null,"&gt;&gt;  that austerity and privatisation of assets was imposed on Greece in order to get the first bailout in

&gt; Why did the Troika demand that Greece cuts spending and raises revenue?

Because they mistakenly identified a lack of liquidity as primarily a problem of debt, and because austerity is the neoliberal idea for handling governmental debt. It is a false model, as macroeconomics predicted when austerity measures were first adopted - when it was predicted that this would raise unemployment and further depress economies, which is precisely what happened - and as we now see.

&gt; Could it be that without doing that Greece will never get a functioning economy? 

No. Governmental debt and ""the economy"" are not this naively related. Almost all industrialised modern states have high debt-to-GDP-ratios, while most states with a low debt-to-GDP-ratio, with exceptions such as Switzerland or Australia, are predominately developing countries.

&gt; Because I'm pretty sure that this is the actual reason.

It might have been the reason, but we now have empirical proof that it doesn't work. 

&gt; &gt; credit, not a gift

&gt; they replaced 15% interest debt that has to be repayed in 2 or 5 years, with 3% interest debt that has to be repayed in 20 years.

&gt; That's more than a 50% reduction of the actual value of the debt. Those 50% were not a credit, they were a gift.

It wasn't a gift because the creditors in 2009 didn't stand to profit from the high-interest debt Greece had accumulated before. Further, if you allow these kinds of crooked reasoning with future interest, *taking* a credit is a gift because it promises debt interest to the creditor. That's obviously silly.

&gt; No, the result of not following the measures is that the debt will not be repaid.

The measures, which Greece by and large was compliant with, have depressed the already depressed economy further, so that now the debt-to-GDP-ratio is higher than ever before, while the government has the same liquidity problem it always had. Only that now the population has not enough money to pay taxes or consume to grow their own economy. So that's good.

&gt; Greece will never do the necessary reforms unless forced by circumstances

**Greece was more compliant with all ""necessary reforms"" ordered than any other country.** Regardless of whether or not this is something they would have done on their own, they are now deeper in the shitter than ever before. 

&gt; I guess Latvians are simply better people than Greece. 

We must read very different articles. Latvia has still not fully recovered from its crash in 2007 and it never had it quite as bad as Greece has it now.

&gt; Sure, the Troika are complete misguided idiots. That's why they are in charge of 200 billion dollars.

Do you have any sources?

Cependant le but de mon commentaire est de decrire que la critique de u/Blackers est une discrimination qui n'a pas lieu d'etre entre ceux qui se reproduisent ""en couple"" et ceux ""hors couple""; nous sommes tous egalement responsables.

Mon avis sur ""les gens veulent"": le probleme c'est que quand on touche aux envies primaires de la population, il y a toujours une opposition extreme (comprehensible). Et personnellement je ne sais pas comment cela pourrait changer, on peut faire evoluer la societe, ce qui est pas evident, et ca n'est qu'une solution temporaire jusqu'a la prochaine crise qui fairait effondrer la-dite societe. Une solution permanente est de changer la nature humaine: et c'est impossible.

Par exemple, le probleme de l'utilisation des ressources fossiles et du changement climatique peut se resoudre du jour en lendemain: il suffit de consommer moins, de supprimer tout les emplois non necessaires (ils consomment de l'energie sans etre critiques a notre survie), d'avoir moins de loisir (nottament moins de voyages et deplacements), de moins dependre de machines et plus du travail manuel (faisable apres la suppression des emplois ""optionels"" = y a plus de bras disponibles), de diminuer la population mondiale (par moins de naissances justement).

Cependant tous ces changements impliquent une perte de certains acquis importants, et s'il y a bien quelque chose que l'humanite ne veut pas, c'est perdre du comfort de vie. Et moi le premier, je peux critiquer notre comportement mais ca reste aussi mon comportement, et je ne veux pas le changer.

Alors si une solution est trouvée... très bien mais c'est pas gagné, non?

Some EU members allow citizenship to ex-colonies' citizens. If you were born in the wrong place, it's no use.
If you're related in the correct way to existing citizens, you can immigrate. Varies per country, a lot.

It's like when RT writes about something, which isn't reported by other western outlets, then it is automatically downvoted. If the actual news itself is bad - alright -, but if it is something profound then why should I keep ignoring it?

Well whatever... I shouldn't bother to read comments anymore. It's full of people who think their opinion is *the right one*. Not the 'I know it better way', but rather the social construct of political correctness and people who don't know what they talk about so they rather produce banter to keep others opinions quiet, as they sure have a political correct crowd behind them. Individual opinions are most likely to be oppressed on reddit anyway through the voting system, so there's this.

Which has already taken place . . that is the entire point. 

When Greece lost 30% of its GDP in 4 years, it was the most extreme fiscal adjustment in human history, let alone in that short of a span. Greece has gone without outside assistance since August 2014 through the largest ""peak debt""(repayment)_ period for the next 5 decades. 

Considering the fact that Greece has adjusted with a 30% decrease in GDP, and the fact that Greece has been paying its debts without outside assistance for 12 months and posting a budget surplus(Before debt payments) every quarter for the last 2-3 years . it is safe to say that Greece is able to sustain on its current path. 

Pensions have been slashed 50% since 2010 so it is unfair to use those numbers also . .and Tsipras has already agreed to raise retirement age to 67 in October 2015. 

Now do you want to continue the austerity to make sure the ""Greeks learned their lesson"" and punish them or accept the fact that incredible sacrifices have been made(as much as your propaganda does not acknowledge this) and form a new growth-plan and soon closer EU or do you want to divide and try to implement a new Treaty of Versailles onto Greece . . the short-term thinkers like you obviously think the punishment must continue . . for some ideological reason.

Err.

First, the US doesn't spend as high a percentage of its GDP on the military as Russia does, but it's far above 2%.  Last I looked, Estonia and Greece were also meeting the 2% level.

Second, in absolute numbers, the sum total of NATO member funding is much higher than Russia's.

[Russia has $69B/year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces) as of 2014.

[NATO members in 2013 had a sum total of $1.02T/year](http://www.stripes.com/news/despite-cuts-nato-still-accounts-for-most-of-world-s-military-spending-1.269882).

Now, in fairness, NATO members are more-politically-fragmented (Will all members respond in the same way to a conflict?).  They are more geographically-separated: the US and Canada can't just roll all of their tanks into a scuffle in Europe.

Une des définitions du terrorisme [issue de Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorisme):

&gt; ""Le terrorisme est l'emploi de la terreur2 à des **fins politiques**, religieuses, idéologiques ou crapuleuses3.

&gt; Les multiples définitions (Alex Schmidt et Berto Jongman en 1988 en listent 109 différentes4) varient sur : l'usage de la violence (certaines comprennent des **groupes n'utilisant pas la violence** mais ayant un discours radical4), les techniques utilisées, la nature du sujet (mettant à part le terrorisme d'État), **l'usage de la peur, le niveau d'organisation, l'idéologie, etc.** Dans nombre de définitions intervient aussi le critère de la victime du terrorisme (civile, désarmée, innocente, attaque contre un État démocratique qui aurait permis au terroriste de s'exprimer légalement, etc.)5.

&gt; Un grand **nombre d'organisations politiques** ou criminelles ont recouru au terrorisme pour faire avancer leur cause ou **en retirer des profits**. Des partis de gauche comme de droite, des groupes nationalistes, religieux ou révolutionnaires, **voire des États**, ont commis des actes de terrorisme.""

Yes migrants benefit economies, under _certain conditions_ however. When Slovakia joined the EU, many of our citizens left for UK, France, Netherlands, ... Those countries benefited tremendously from Slovak migrants. Why? Slovaks are highly educated, most have university degrees and those who don't, have specialized skills from vocational schools; welders, mechanics, cooks, etc. Slovaks also integrate easily. When we go to UK, we learn English, we drink tea with milk, we praise the Queen, we eat fish and chips and we work ungodly hours. Thus UK profits.

These middle east/african migrants are not educated, do not posses skills that are beneficial to our economy and arguably, do not integrate easily due to vast cultural differences. Even if they had degrees, they are not recognized by our government, they do not speak the obscure, difficult to learn language and thus will not be able to contribute to the economy positively. What's worse is that Slovakia is not their desired final destination. They want to move on to Germany, UK, etc. So we feed them, we house them, we process them and then they give us the middle finger. And those that will choose to stay will be dependent on us supporting them for previously stated reasons.

Do you now see the difference?

&gt;
&gt; Unesco decided that the vineyards, wine cellars and sales houses where champagne is produced and sold were culturally significant.
&gt;
&gt; It was one of 11 sites given World Heritage status by Unesco at a meeting in Germany on Saturday.
&gt;
&gt; The status should ensure the sites receive special protection in future.
&gt;
&gt; Unesco said the champagne industry was ""a very specialised artisan activity that has become an agro-industrial enterprise.""
&gt;
&gt; Its addition to the list - that already includes Macchu Picchu in Peru, the Taj Mahal in India and the Great Wall of China - could bring extra financial aid and more tourists.

I think the bigger issue there is that your politicians lied about what they brought the country into because even now it is not 100% certain what it will or can become &amp; it should be thoroughly discussed but merely a forum to discuss internal trade agreements &amp; the like it was never meant to be.

&gt;I don't think the EU realises how young it is, imposing big rules on people this quick can threaten its very existence. But yeh, this proposal will never come to anything, I'm just commenting on the wider idea that the EU shouldn't stray too far and step on the toes of national parliaments, national politicians, and more importantly the people who voted for them.

And some will agree with you. Some will say it overstepped that boundary 20 years ago.
Others will say that we shouldn't have stopped halfway when the euro was introduced so that Greece wouldn't be in this mess right now which comes very close to a federalist standpoint.
I don't think the pace at which this union is advancing is a clear cut problem as you make it out to be. Again I think its that the UK's decision or second take on it if you will is being made now &amp; not long ago. With some group of discontent having slowly grown because UK politicians didn't want to touch it because they majority there is pro EU or at the very least their vision of it.


The Union has existed for nearly 60 years now &amp; had predecessors long before that.
It is not going too quick. If I remember well Churchill suggested something more integrated then what we're looking at now in '46 or '47

edit: I think another issue is overlap of competences and I'd much prefer the ""Belgian"" approach where one regional government does one group of things &amp; the other does other stuff.
I feel like the current one leaves people uninterested or better said uninformed about what's going on &amp; sometimes there's conflicts &amp; long processes of compromise there which the anti EU side loves to grab onto.",null,0,null,1436040783,null,0,1436042476,0,css8bcl,null,t3_3c3ajk,null,t1_css8bcl,null,t1_css7new,null,null,null,1437585572,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

But you mentioned that there is no centralization and it is clear that there is. I also said they have similar objectives, to push a specific agenda. It's not *just* bias, it is formatting from start to end, how a story will be presented (which is highly interesting once you start observing it), how the debate will be framed, which topics will be discussed, which questions are off limits etc. 

You say that in totalitarian regimes the media promote the state's absolute agenda which is true. But in west, generally, the interests of the elites, the financial institutions, the media and the politicians are so heavily intertwined that in most cases they are  one entity pushing their uniformed agenda. 

The propaganda model predicts that there can be cases which stories out of the general agenda of the media can be publicized. That can happen due to either a journalist trying to have integrity where he will most likely suffer personally for doing it or opposite interests using their media as a proxy, outing one another.

According to ELSTAT whistleblowers the Greek debt was illegally revised up again and again in 2009 by Andreas Georgiou the then head of ELSTAT who was a political appointee with no proper background in statistics, in concert with the then Greek Finance Minister of the time George Papaconstantinou*. According to the whistleblowers this was done to make a high but still manageable and serviceable debt, into a crisis that could not be managed without inviting Troika intervention. According to Logothetis and Georganta, alot of the members of ELSTAT were disgusted by what Andreas Georgiou the head of ELSTAT was doing. Six Elstat board members were dismissed in June 2011 after clashing with Georgiou. There are court cases against him and his collaborator the former Finance Minister, George Papaconstantinou. The head of ELSTAT at the time probably did that because he was a political appointee chosen by Germany to serve German interests and screw over Greece. Nikos Logothetis says Germany protected him. Adding to that illegally upward revision of the debt, the then Prime Minister, who has since fled Greece, George Papandreou, made constant statements to the Greek and international media to the effect: ""I am the leader of a very corrupt country,"" this ruined investor confidence in Greece, destroyed Greek credit ratings and shut Greece from being able to get loans on the international scene at a good debt spread. This left no choice but the Troika way or default(which the comprador political elite would never consider). (Btw the Europhile Greeks of Reddit are all ""I am George Papandreou."" They act like they are victimized by a corrupt country, and support the anti-democratic, unanswerable EU bureacracy and its austerity policies. Papandreou FYI, was the third in his family line of political dynasty. His great-grandfather came to power in Greece not by elections or ballot, but by British tanks and troops after WWII. Earlier this great grandfather also in WWI helped Venizelos form another illegal government in Thessaloniki to join WWI in the British and Allied camp in that war. His grandson is in the same mold of comprador traitor, serving foreign interests, through and through.)

&gt;http://links.org.au/node/4347  
&gt;Here are some key points that could be revealed by carrying out an audit.

&gt;Greek debt, which was at 113% of GDP in 2009 before the onset of the Greek crisis and the intervention by the Troika, which now holds 4/5 of total debt, reached 175% of GDP in 2014. We therefore see that the Troika intervention was followed by a very considerable increase in Greek debt.

&gt;Between 2010 and 2012, the loans that the Troika granted to Greece were very largely used to repay its most important creditors at that time, mainly the private banks of the principal European economies, starting with the French and German banks. |4| In 2009, some 80% of Greek public debt was held by the private banks of seven EU countries. Fifty percent was held by French and German banks alone. In a recent ARTE documentary |5| Paulo Nogueira Batista, one of the IMF’s executive directors, claims that all IMF board members knew that the loan was actually intended to save the French and German banks not Greece. |6| 

&gt;Philippe Legrain, advisor to the president of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso in 2010 when the Troika granted its loan, specifies that ""IMF decision makers were overruled by the IMF managing director of the time, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was then running for the French presidency and consequently wanted to prevent French banks from facing losses. Similarly German banks had persuaded Angela Merkel that it would be terrible if ever they should lose money. So the Eurozone governments decided to pretend that Greece was only facing temporary problems."" They had to bypass ""an essential principle in the Maastricht Treaty, namely the no-bail out clause. The loans to Athens were not intended to save Greece but the French and German banks that had been foolish enough to grant loans to an insolvent State.""",null,0,null,1436042233,null,0,false,0,css8zak,null,t3_3c49q6,null,t1_css8zak,null,t1_css8t6p,null,null,null,1437586194,null,-6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-6,null

Primo, j'utilise le terme musique Afro-Americaine pour signifier une culture musicale assée large et que je ne maîtrise pas forcément. 

Quant au fait de parler de cet exemple, c'est un parmi tant d'autres. L'aspect ''racial'' comme tu dis, même si ici, on parle plutôt d'aspect culturel, est essentiel car il a justement été modifié suite à sa reappropriation par de grands labels musicaux. 

Je m'explique:
1 Reappropriations de la culture rap, etc pour le grand public. 
2 Les reappropriations en questions ont alors à leur tour influencé la communauté noire dont elles étaient issues à la base. 

Autre exemple , le Cosby show, fameuse série mettant en scène une famille noire américaine a eu un impact extrêmement positif. Par mimétisme, les enfants noirs américains ont voulu faire comme les personnages de cette série. Le taux d'étudiants noirs a augmenté après coup. Effet positif me direz vous.

Mais le problème est que ce mimétisme, cette influence fonctionne également dans l'autre sens. Le rap par exemple à changé suite à sa reappropriation et a adopté des valeurs parfois discutables (violence etc),  le tout porté par des icônes noires majoritairement. 

Les effets positifs du Cosby show se sont estompés pour laisser la place à un regain de délinquance chez la communauté Afro-Americaine comme chez d'autres qui se sont identifiées à leurs idoles. 

Edit: Les grandes idées et exemples viennent d'un universitaire américain nommé Jerry kroth. Sur des sujets similaires, Chomsky est plus  intéressant encore. Tout deux sont présent sur YouTube si besoin.

Ce qui m’ennuie franchement dans ce genre de problèmes, c'est qu'on entend d'un côté des gens qui parlent de loi (""c'est interdit ta gueule, va te faire foutre""), et de l'autre des gens qui souffrent (""vous comprenez, je veux un enfant, c'est extrêmement douloureux de pas en avoir, c'est possible techniquement pourquoi vous m'en empêcher"").

&gt;Russia should be growing its economy like crazy

&gt;since they have more natural resources than any other country in the world but instead they're isolating themselves, pissing people off, they don't have a free economy or open democracy,

Dont worry most commodities countries including well developped like Australia and Canada are in recession.

And it is Australia that has the biggest share of natural ressouces being trade right now not Russia.


This is the ressource curses no matter how strong the industrial base. 

After all in 2003 natural ressources was **43% of Russian GDP** equal to Saudi Arabia it has  fallen **to 15%**

According to the World Bank

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.TOTL.RT.ZS

Wihle  state revenues depend on them at  50% in 2012 now only at 23%.

And with an Industrial sector that grew by 250% , with the share of the  non ressources sector growing at an average of 15%.



&gt;they're isolating themselves

That must be a joke

With **some countries** in western Europe sure(not even all at that)  but definitely not the whole world please  people in Asia , Latin America have complete different point of view since for the first time we are opening our market to them and making trade deals and have quite good relations

The map of sanctions speak for itself anyway

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Ukrainian_crisis#/media/File:Sanctions_2014_Russia2.png


&gt;and their resources are primarily used to line the pockets of oligarchs and thugs.

The GINI coeefficient of Russia is similar and close to that of UK and USA

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI

&gt;It's just 120 million people, enormous land mass and a huge percentage of the world's natural resources being poorly managed and it's a shame. Russia should be as rich as America.

Well we have an higher Foreign reseves than them(but that doesnt count) and being in the top 10 of foreign reserves.

Basically a country that was bankrupt in 1998 to its lowest with a GDP per capita of 5989$ US and you expect it to catch the biggest economy in the world in less than one decade???

Are you playing dumb? wich countries have done that?

Despite that experts have agreed that progress of Russia where fast and the rising of living standards rose phenomally?


&gt;And with all this, you still have random Russians acting tough on the internet when they should be mad at their own government

Mad for what? Because Crimea is back to the mainland? , because despite sanctions unemployement is at 5,4%(a number that 95% of European countries would dream to have? despite that inflation is falling since 4 months, that our poverty line is lower than the average in the EU or that we will only have only 1 year of recession according to the IMF and the World Bank? or because our geopolitical interest is quite secure?

&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11654639/IMF-has-betrayed-its-mission-in-Greece-captive-to-EMU-creditors.html

&gt;The IMF’s Original Sin in Greece was to let Dominique Strauss-Kahn hijack the institution to save Europe's banks and the euro when the crisis erupted, dooming Greece to disaster.

&gt;...

&gt;The Greeks accuse the IMF of colluding in an EMU-imposed austerity regime that breaches the Fund’s own rules and is in open contradiction with five years of analysis by its own excellent research department and chief economist, Olivier Blanchard.

&gt;...

&gt;Ashoka Mody, former chief of the IMF’s bail-out in Ireland, refuses to criticise his former colleagues on the European desk, but the meaning of the words I quoted last night are clear enough.
&gt;“Everything that we have learned over the last five years is that it is stunningly bad economics to enforce austerity on a country when it is in a deflationary cycle. Trauma patients have to heal their wounds before they can train for the 10K.""
&gt;“I am frankly shocked that we are even having a discussion about raising VAT at all in these circumstances. We have just seen a premature rise in VAT knock the wind out of a country as strong as Japan.""
&gt;“Syriza should recruit the IMF’s research department to be their spokesman because they are saying almost exactly the same thing as Syriza on the economics of this. The entire strategy of the creditors is wrong and the longer this goes on, the more is its going to cost them.”

&gt;...

&gt;Yet leaked minutes from the IMF board meetings showed that all the emerging market members (and Switzerland) opposed the terms of the first loan package for Greece. They protested that it was intended to save the euro, not Greece.

&gt;It loaded yet more debt onto the crushed shoulders of an already bankrupt country, and further complicated the picture by allowing one large French bank and one German bank – no names please – to offload much of their €25bn combined exposure onto EMU taxpayers.
&gt;“Debt restructuring should have been on the table,” said Brazil's member. The loans “may be seen not as a rescue of Greece, which will have to undergo a wrenching adjustment, but as a bailout of Greece’s private debt holders, mainly European financial institutions”.
Arvind Virmani, India’s member, was prophetic. ""The scale of the fiscal reduction without any monetary policy offset is unprecedented. It is a mammoth burden that the economy could hardly bear,” he said.

&gt;“Even if, arguably, the programme is successfully implemented, it could trigger a deflationary spiral of falling prices, falling employment and falling fiscal revenues that could eventually undermine the programme itself."" This is exactly what has happened.

&gt;Consider it a mea culpa submerged in a deep pool of calculus and regression analysis: The International Monetary Fund’s top economist [Olivier Blanchard ] today acknowledged that the fund blew its forecasts for Greece and other European economies because it did not fully understand how government austerity efforts would undermine economic growth.

&gt;Even if Greece accepted all of the austerity measures demanded by its main creditors, the Troika, it still would not be able to make ends meet by 2030, according to IMF estimates revealed in a set of documents obtained by a German newspaper.

&gt;The most optimistic scenario shows that Greece would face an unsustainable debt in 2030 even if it agreed to the package of tax increases and spending cuts proposed by the European commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF in exchange for a five-month €15.5bn loan from its creditors.

&gt;These prospects were outlined in six documents that were part of the “final” proposal offered to Greece by the three main creditors on Friday. The papers were obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and seen by The Guardian.

&gt;The estimates provide support for Greece’s decision not to accept the bailout deal. They prove that for Greece to survive economically, it needs real debt relief measures, not austerity reforms.

&gt;According to the IMF, Greece would be unable to sustain a debt level of 118% of GDP. In 2012, the organization said that 110% of GDP is the highest debt threshold the country could take on.

&gt;Currently the country’s debt level amounts to 175% of GDP, and that percentage could easily rise if the country were to slip into recession.

&gt;The documents stressed that even if Greece posted stellar economic growth for 15 years, the debt level would still be higher than 110% of GDP, adding that Greece had no chance of meeting that target.

None of the above applies to me or to many of the people i know.
I agree the tax evasion rates in Greece are very high for the last decade but it's only logical when self employed Greeks are asked to pay more than 60%+(i read somewhere that it's a lot more but just to be safe i will leave it at 60%) of their monthly reported income servicing debt.
That doesn't mean we are lazy.

Sure there are some that will try to evade taxes no matter if they can afford it or not, as is in every other country.But the average citizen just can't afford to pay it. We still try though. I never tried to evade taxes although i barely have enough money to feed myself.
As for the early retirements and generous pensions, that was for people working for the government mostly, i am not sure about the statistics so i can't comment on it or confirm anything, i am just going to say that both of my parents will be eligible for retirement at 65+, as it was for my grandparents with a 500euro pension.

What is happening to us now, is happening all over the world. And those that are still not seriously affected will be in the future.
I don't blame EU for what happened. I blame the corrupted government officials and the people that voted for them.
But please try to see it from my eyes, i never tried to evade taxes, my parents are killing themselves at work for as long as i remember and yes there are statistics that show increase on tax evasion or early retirement or huge pensions but it's for the selected few, not for everyone. When one person gets a big pension there are 20 that get bread crumbs. When one person retires at 45 there are 20 that work until they are 70.
I guess one has to live in this conditions to really understand what's going on. 

Anyway all i want to say to everyone here is, Greece has a problem. We ask for your support and your help, we don't ask for gifts or someone to blame.Are you going to stand beside us and help us or are you going to find ways to justify yourself for turning your back to us?

Dann löst man die Volumensformel nach h auf und setzt dieses h in den Term O ein. Man erhält dann die Funktion O(r) und leitet diese ab. Die Nullstelle dieser Ableitung ist dann der Wert von r, bei dem die Oberfläche minimale ist. Das sind dann ca 6,8 cm.

First step is register as a resident, second step is to apply for a social security number with these guys: http://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/. Third visit should be to the Jobcenter. Bring your rental contract and your registration as resident plus some proof that you used to live in the USA the last few years (plane ticket, pay stubs, drivers license from home).  The Jobcenter should give you list of things to do, which will keep you busy for the next few weeks or so.

Please check the rules for ""Kosten der Unterkunft"" or ""KdU"" in Berlin. Doing a quick search the maximum amount of rent the Jobcenter seems to be willing to cover for one person seems to be between 405-425 EUR per month, depending upon how large the house with your apartment is and how it is heated.

Also, I'll be blunt: the US has been less-willing to provide money to Greece than Germany has.  Germany, France, and other European sources extended Greece below-market-rate loans.  The US did not.  What Germany is talking about now, worst case, is simply doing what the US *always has been doing*, which is not extending below-market-rate subsidies to Greece.

While I appreciate the political side of this, and that European creditors may benefit in ways that the US does not from subsidizing Greece, I also think that it's not entirely fair to Germany to ignore that fact.  Germany is, in absolute terms, not really threatening to do anything other than adopt US behavior.

True, the Greek-German press discourse has become a bit acidic, due to Germans being angry about potential loss of their taxes, and Greeks being angry about potential economic damage due to change from the *status quo*, but surely the tone of words in journals at the moment is not the thing that really matters, at the end of the day?",null,0,null,1436045114,null,0,false,0,cssacyc,null,t3_3c4sqd,null,t1_cssacyc,null,t1_cssa77v,null,null,null,1437587169,null,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6,null

Flirting with you aggressively?

Or do you have to put in good effort to get laid, even if you can do it consistently. Therein lies the big difference.

Now imagine this is all true. How could it be stated without sounding narcissistic? It can't. So, that character judgement is irrelevant here, assuming I'm telling the truth, which I am.

Why should they? I quote from a recent article by Nobel Laurate in Economics Joseph Stiglitz:

&gt;[We should be clear: almost none of the huge amount of money loaned to Greece has actually gone there. It has gone to pay out private-sector creditors – including German and French banks. Greece has gotten but a pittance, but it has paid a high price to preserve these countries’ banking systems.](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/joseph-stiglitz-how-i-would-vote-in-the-greek-referendum)

It's not *their* debt, it's private debt that was socialised to protect a structurally unsound monetary union.

The Greeks, as well as the Irish and other periphery nations that experienced banking crises, received loans from the central European nations to prop up their banking systems - not because it was a generous/right thing to do - but because German (mostly) banks held huge amounts of periphery debt on their balance sheets:

&gt;[The application of regulatory rules allowed German banks to accumulate effectively unlimited international assets in relation to the capital they held if those assets were triple-A rated.  As a consequence the balance sheets of German banks were full not only of sub-prime mortgage-backed securities, but also sovereign and bank bonds issued in the periphery of the euro zone.](http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/2013/11/11/dirty-secret-euro-zone-crisis-german-banks/)

Had the Germans not propped up the banking systems in the periphery, they would have faced their own catastrophic banking crisis which would have led to a need to recapitalise their own banks. The loans made by the center to the periphery were made on the basis of cynical self-interest, not heart-warming solidarity to help those experiencing trouble.


&gt;&gt;As for ""austerity"", a word that has been thorougly demonized, it doesn't mean much more than ""when you're broke, spend less"". You are broke. Spend less. The idea that you have a choice relies on someone else footing the bill. 

No. As appealing as your 'household budget' view of economics might be, austerity doesn't mean that. Austerity is an ideology to dismantle worker's rights, state institutions and political and economic sovereignty. It's not a set of coherent economic policies designed to get a country 'back on its feet'. 

&gt;&gt;That because our countries owe much more than the money we loaned to your small country, we should forgive it? France and germany and some others have loaned 700 euros to the greek government for each of their citizens.

Had they not, they would have had to spend the money at home, recapitalising their own banks instead of giving it to the Greek government to recapitalise the Greek banking system. These populist soundbites are as dishonest and vapid as they are dangerous. They do nothing other than make people in Germany hate people in Greece. The real issue here is the socialisation of private debt - paid by the *taxpayers of Europe*.

Shitting all over the Greeks is not just missing the point, it's akin to turning around and shooting an orphaned child in the head. If you're going to blame anybody, blame the German, Greek, French, UK, [INSERT_COUNTRY] and Irish politicians who have led us down the path to where we, the common people, are now blindly fighting with each other whilst trillions of euros of private losses have been punted down to us to pay. All the while, we're told that we must pay for it by making our hospitals shitter as we work for longer for less.

edit:
Because the German people know how fast thinks can change and the wrong people can come to power, we are not very supportive with the idea to get an army that is actually representing the German economic power.

&gt; Because of EU quotas, you'd give up free EU money

As I said before, Eastern European countries weren't imploding before 2004. They functioned quite alright for the 15 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. And remember, those EU funds do *not* go directly to the country budgets. No, they're mostly in the form of partially financing some road or a highway (but the country still needs to field majority of the money), or some environenmental project and the like.

Also, the way these funds are distributed is very problematic and leads oftentimes to squandering of the money on bad projects and investments.

I am being 100% realistic when I say the countries could stop receiving the money tomorrow, and not that much would be changed.

&gt;  you'd give up Schengen and have to set up and control your own borders

Not true, Shengen and EU are different entities. For instance, Norway and Switzerland are in Shengen, but not EU, while Britain and Ireland are in EU but not Shengen. Shengen would remain unchanged, especially because eastern europe isn't afraid that economic migrants from Germany might flee to eastern europe.

&gt; you'd give up the Euro and deal with inflation and taxes

Most of Eastern Europe doesn't have the euro, and honestly we do not want the Euro, because it is a political project with little basis in good Economics that has already failed. You cannot have a monetary union without a fiscal one.

&gt; you'd give up the banking union and it's safety mechanisms

There's no banking union, I think you're mistaken.

&gt; you'd give up your participation in the EU decision process

If we're not in the EU, why would we care about EU decision process?

&gt;&gt;When I am an old woman I shall wear purple

With a red hat that doesn't go, and doesn't suit me,

And I shall spend my pension

on brandy and summer gloves

And satin sandals,

and say we've no money for butter.

I shall sit down on the pavement when I am tired,

And gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells,

And run my stick along the public railings,

And make up for the sobriety of my youth.

I shall go out in my slippers in the rain

And pick the flowers in other people's gardens,

And learn to spit.

You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat,

And eat three pounds of sausages at a go,

Or only bread and pickle for a week,

And hoard pens and pencils and beer mats

and things in boxes.

But now we must have clothes that keep us dry,

And pay our rent and not swear in the street,

And set a good example for the children.

We will have friends to dinner and read the papers.

But maybe I ought to practise a little now?

So people who know me

are not too shocked and surprised,

When suddenly I am old

and start to wear purple! ",null,0,null,1436046503,null,0,false,0,cssazu2,null,t3_3c4enz,null,t1_cssazu2,null,t3_3c4enz,null,null,null,1437587475,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

Obviously you dont. Thats my honest opinion.

&gt;RT has special place in my heart because they are part of propaganda campaign that fueled a war in Ukraine that killed thousands of ukrainians.

War in Ukraine has much deeper roots than RT propaganda. It started with a coup and got fuelled with new governments refusal to negotiate with rebels. 

&gt;I dont know much about western propaganda campaigns and worst outlets that spread it but i know for sure that none of them made people en masse take weapons, come into my country and start killing other people.

In your original post you wrote how propaganda works. Manipulation of one's world view. That and direct financing of opposition led to coup and election of Poroshenko. And keep in mind that you had an option for new elections and transfer of power from president to opposition on table just to have it derailed by a coup (which got instantly recognised by west.. like wtf). And you all swallowed and supported that willingly due to propaganda.

Im not telling you to take Russian propaganda instead, im telling you to reject western/Ukr propaganda. I read 99.9% of western media and i still find flaws in its propaganda (its like they arent even trying... and still people believe it).

&gt; I also know for sure that RT propaganda scale outmatches any puny ukrainian attempts by hundreds of millions of dollars.

Arent RT and other Russian media censored in Ukraine?

&gt; I also know that nobody here knows much about ukrainian propagandist outlets while RT is quite famous.

Really? Ukraine has access to all western media. ""Ukraine says"" its quite common in bbc, guardian, cnn, forbes,...

&gt;Your nation predicts to have its economy contract by 3% this year and in one year the ruble has lost half its value. 


You mean a contraction where forecats initially  where at 5% ??

Now where the World Bank has revised it to 2,7%?

Sorry not 3% , I wont even be surprise if they do a better revision by the third period(around September)

 You mean that my country is rebuilding its industrial base with almost disintegrated post USSR and that it will be finish rebuilding by 2020 ?


Good f**cking things that experts have agreed that sanctions are beneficials and that Putin is engaging in an economic plan.

You mean  entire sectors  that have been completely morganized?

For example,

Pharma2020 was outline in 2009 and right now the first phase of the plan gave strong results.

The Russian pharmaceutical market is considered one of the most dynamic in the world, growing 10-12% on average per year since 2003

http://www.s-ge.com/en/filefield-private/files/25703/field_blog_public_files/5244

http://cbpartners.com/blog/russia-a-look-back-at-pharma2020-and-a-look-forward-to-its-prospects.html

This same pharmaceutial sector predicting   to be in the top three by 2020?


Yes Russia is completely shifting its industry and is accelarating as fast it can people that are saying that Putin is not reforming are completely blind.

First it was  the arms industry that have been completely refomed  and it was a complete sucess I already gave an explanation with links and sources.

The aircraft industry is still still strong but will likely growth  and might even reach in the top three by 2025(Wel they are only two companies Airbus and Boeing)

The government plans to funnel $28 billion into Russia's aviation industry in order by 2025 to haul Russia up into the world's top three aircraft manufacturers. Under the program, designed by Industry and Trade Ministry plan and approved by the cabinet, the government will invest 714 billion rubles ($20.5 billion) of state funds into the aviation industry through 2025, while a further 277 billion rubles ($7.9 billion) are to come from private pockets.

 http://government.ru/en/docs/3347/

Asia and other players like Russia will take a greater share of production in the aircraft industry

Fix that for you , **you mean Asia techonology supremacy** and U.S, Europe decline

Funny you didnt even metioned Europe 
as for the U.S you mean themselves getting surpass by Asia also?

While things like silicon Valley are not real; it is made possible only by unrealistic price to earning ratios of American stocks caused by monetary expansion; example, Facebook trades at 72 times earns, but Samsung (just the electronic division) trades at 8.25 times earning; thus Facebook is worth $255 Billion and Samsung is worth $187 billion; even though Samsung net profit was $22 billion and Facebook's was only $2.9 billion.

&gt;""Just under 15% of Germany's total arms exports are made to Greece, its biggest market in Europe,"" Papadimoulis said, reeling off figures from a scruffy armchair in his party's parliamentary office. ""Greece has paid over €2bn (£1.6bn) for submarines that proved to be faulty and which it doesn't even need.

If they didn't need them, why the hell did they buy them? Excluding the ""faulty"" part, which I know nothing about, this pretty much sounds like a shopping addict blaming the evil malls for trying to sell their wares. If the greek government purchased submarines they had no need for than that's their responsibility. What was germany supposed to do? Double check greek military capabilities and then deny them the trade they were seeking because ""they don't really need it""?

&gt;Thanos Dokos, a leading Greek defence expert, says rational debate on such military extravagance has been made impossible by the supposed Turkish threat and a fear among politicians of being labelled unpatriotic.

The article pretty much admits that one of the main reasons for the high defense spending is not outside pressure, but politicians being afraid to do so because of possible public backlash due to the perceived threat of a turkish invasion - quite possibly the result of a lot of fearmongering for political gain in the first place.

&gt;The imbalance has spawned speculation that peripheral countries in Europe with vulnerable frontiers such as Greece are being exploited in terms of defence spending by wealthier states at Europe's core.

They might actually have a point here, but if anything, it points towards yet another deficiency in the infrastructure of the EU - and gives another reason why a european military is a great idea.

The EU started out as a military an economic alliance called the BENELUX, a pact between Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, because they were too weak on their own in WWII and got overrun so fast.

Now history has taught us that Nazi germany was a result of economic discrimination and exploitation, they butchered germany's economy and gave it no chance to recover, but once the dawes plan came in effect it started improving, only after it collapsed did the nazi party gain a foothold in the empoverished people.

Problem is (IMO): everybody just escalated in the laste months (or even years). An example: Merkel and Schäuble promised (as in: not to be broken), that no money will be lost and Greece will pay back every penny. There have been those, that already said, that this is impossible, back then, but there you are. Now, explaining, that the money is lost nevertheless is kind of... complicated (in terms of being re-elected afterwards). I wouldn't say ""impossible"", but complicated. All the while, there have been reports of, lets say, ""interesting"" behaviour in most media around here. Stuff like ""Greeks don't pay their taxes"", dead people still getting their pensions (going to their relatives, presumably) etc. Things, that were quite handy to convince the own population, why you need to be strict. People start to believe that kind of stuff (and to be honest: as somebody who actually likes to pay taxes, because I kind of like the investments in infrastructure, public health etc.pp., I have a hard time figuring out, how widespread tax evasion is even a thing. I mean, how do the people thing, a state is going to work that way?).

Now on the other hand, you have Varoufakis accusing the creditors of terrorism (basically behaving like a whining baby), while claiming, that they need to get a debt cut (which may or may not be the truth, I don't know. I have the impression, that it is the truth, because the debt is just too high). So, the people in the creditor countries (and let's be honest: much of the discussion has been directed at Germany), feel being adressed by those comments. From their point of view, it now became: ""Money gone, more money needed, being abused as terrorists"". You can imagine, how this helps swaying a population towards spending more, when they perceive, that they themselves don't have enough (which may not necessarily be true, but there you are again). There might be a point, where legitimate stubborness in the negotiations turns into an impossible to pass obstacle. I'm not sure, if the referendum is that point. I mean, now it's no longer ""Their stupid government"". Now it's directly ""the Greek"", that are responsible for the decision. So this gamble might have been a bit too much. It could make it impossible for ""the other side"", to make concessions, as their populations might set their governments on fire.

Statt Schnitzel jeden Tag mal lieber Linsensuppe (auch viel Eiweiß drin) und Morgens Omelette oder Ei auf Brot und den Braten auf den Sonntag verschieben macht am Ende schon sehr, sehr viel Sinn.

Da muss man früher ansetzen: Hauswirtschaft sollte z.B. Pflichtfach sein.

null,false,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,null,"&gt;There are other angles to look at the situation from. Have you seen this article?

I have - and the idea of the rest of Europe 'treating Greece like America treats Kentucky' is that, again, it boils down to ""give Greece as much money as it wants"", this time as transfers in a transfer union.

Thing about that is that Greece is not to the eurozone as Kentucky is to America - Greece remains a sovereign country in many many ways, and Kentucky is not. Nor am I a Greek citizen, although I'm a European one - but if I were a US citizen, I would have all the rights of a Kentucky citizen in Kentucky. 

The problem with this bit:

&gt;Rather than have Greece default, and then possibly need to bail out their own banks, European governments gave Greece giant loans so Greece could pay the private banks what they owed.

is that it's not actually true - private banks took a haircut of 50% or more on their Greek debt back in 2012, and the governments of those banks bailed out their own banks as required. The remainder has largely been replaced at much lower interest rates and much longer maturities, often with interest deferral. The money that Greece would be defaulting on is loans from other governments. And even that ignores the fact that a Greek default is a default on money they spent on themselves - it's not just a number out of thin air. They borrowed that money, they spent that money - the, er, 'default' position is clearly that they pay back that money.

The counter-argument is that they simply can't, that their debt is 'unsustainable'. But Greece's interest burden as a % of GDP is not much higher than Ireland's, so 'unsustainable' is very much a term that depends on your preferred definition. The IMF's preferred definition is ""able to get back in the markets and return IMF funds"", for which the primary larker is debt capital to GDP, hence their preference for a debt writedown - one that doesn't involve the IMF, of course, because that would be counter-productive for their aims. For the IMF, it's not about what's best for Greece or the eurozone in the longer term, it's about getting the IMF out of Greece.

From a Greek perspective (or one Greek perspective), 'unsustainable' means that paying it cuts into their ability to sustain their economy with what it wants, which is government money - because their economy has been sustained that way for many years, and is bent well away from productive to 'dependent'. That's what 'austerity' is cutting into - the economy that depends on government money, from a government that can't sustain such a level of handouts without borrowing. As I said, for Greece to be able to sustain its economy that way again is exactly as unsustainable as it was before, and that means that doing it will just land us back here again - the only thing that kept the balls in the air for Greece was a combination of falsifying official statistics, and the finance industry's ludicrous belief that risk had effectively been eliminated. So, short of those two coinciding again, and nobody calling them, we'll be here again sooner rather than later. The noise over austerity serves to obscure the fact that there are real problems with the Greek economy, that there seems to be insufficient political will to solve those problems, and that Greece seems to be primarily interested in getting back to business as before rather than doing so.

If we are to have a transfer union - which I don't find objectionable in itself - then we'd have to have much more limited sovereignty on the part of individual countries to avoid fiscal policies which unnecessarily ramp up the need for transfers, and I'd want to be sure that no country is simply enjoying a free ride at other's expense - and indeed, no part of a country. I'd want to be sure that if my money is going to Greece, or wherever, that the recipient is not so corrupt that my taxes are going to feed a klepto-elite, or indeed a bloated public sector or pork-barrel economy. I would say, in short ""no taxation without representation"", and that Greece cannot get to spend my taxes without me having a say in Greek affairs, without Greece being answerable directly to fraud and corruption bodies in whom I have trust, and with whom I have influence.

Is there any manifesto that provides some clarity on issues like that?

You're operating under the assumption that the debt (I mention this as the interest payments make up the most significant portion of the deficit problem) *should* be financed. Let me introduce you to the term Odious Debt:

&gt;[In international law, odious debt, also known as illegitimate debt, is a legal theory that holds that **the national debt incurred by a regime for purposes that do not serve the best interests of the nation, should not be enforceable.** Such debts are, thus, considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the regime that incurred them and not debts of the state. In some respects, the concept is analogous to the invalidity of contracts signed under coercion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odious_debt)

Socialising private debt does not serve the best interests of Greece, or any European nation. It serves the interests of private investors on Wall St., Frankfurt, Paris and the City of London. 

Instead of imposing austerity on Greece, Ireland, Spain etc. a much better option would have been to allow the banks to fail and use the trillions already spent on recapitalising these failed institutions to create a series of state banks with the explicit goal of funding infrastructure development and industrial projects.

Of course, that would require a common, balanced industrial development plan for the EU with surplus recycling mechanisms. 

We can't have that though, best just to tell all the Greeks with an air of moral superiority that they're lazy; that they need to tighten their belts and pull themselves up by their bootstraps like the industrious Germans.

Germany's ""tendency to imperialism"", if one exists, was only for about a 20 year period from late 1910's until 1930's.  It's not like they were enslaving Europe for eons.  If anyone was doing that, it was the UK.

But think for a moment about Germany... what makes them so successful?  It's not that they are a huge (by size) nation that has massive natural resources.  It's not that they swing their military might around to get what they want.  It's not that they are a despotic nation.  If you look at the German mentality... they work hard, they are socially responsible, they value hard work, education, saving and reasonable laws.  That gives them fantastic productivity, engineering, design and absolves them of many of the things that got Greece where it is - things like grift, nepotism/cronyism, avoiding taxes, thinking only of one's self, etc.  

In a global economy, it's fine to run your country the way you see fit... but if someone else is getting ahead and you're falling behind, you can't expect them to just give you money because you don't want to work like they do.

Not really. My own interpretation is 'we vote no' if we think Europeans have been our enemies who want to humiliate us and subjugate us to their evil schemes, 'we vote yes' if we think Europeans have been our allies and have largely treated us honestly.

Throughout Greek forums, the rhetoric is clear from the 'no' side that whoever is voting 'yes' is supposedly undignifiedly prostrating themselves to be humiliated by the German conquerors, Merkel and Scheuble, who are supposedly acting like new nazis towards Greece.

The division has nothing to do with the sustainability of debt or not. The two sides are divided according to whether they believe the Europeans to be deliberately seeking Greece's harm or not.

No, not really. There will definitely be no gifts, so it's quite obvious that it's always debt.

&gt;&gt;Greece will pay their debt whenever they feel like it and everybody else can go on with their lifes.

&gt;So you hate losing some of the money but are completely fine with losing all of it?

I would not lose a single cent in any case. I specifally wrote ""Greece **will pay their debt**"".

&gt;Right... the bank is your friend that is why they give you loans.

I see, you would have preferred ... absolutely no help at all? We are not Greeces bank!

And may I ask who will loan the government money? Private companies cannot enforce what governments do with money they borrow from them. They will price that (very high) risk in and what you have is massive interest. There is a big reason why this isn't a thing today - governments will be unable to borrow, or at best at ridiculous interest rates.

&gt; Instead of imposing austerity on Greece, Ireland, Spain etc. a much better option would have been to allow the banks to fail

Ah, another person who doesn't understand austerity. Austerity = Government can't afford to spend that much. Okay, you let the banks fail - now your financial system has collapsed, investors lose confidence and the government cannot borrow to finance its' budget deficit. That means it will have to spend less... sound familiar? THAT'S STILL AUSTERITY.

Greece, Ireland and all the other countries don't understand that austerity isn't a bad word, it isn't an unnatural construct, it's the fact that unless someone is willing to lend you money, you can't spend more than you earn. Shockingly, either you accept the bailout and implement austerity, or no investor will lend to a bankrupt state and you STILL have to implement austerity (spend less). There's no choice here unless someone gives you free money with no intention of getting it back (since surplus is the only way you can get paid back).

null,false,New-Atlantis,EURO,European Union,null,"This is an old speculative article which proved to be untrue. To bring this up now is clearly intended to whip up hostile propaganda. Germany did not sign any new arms deal in the last 5 years and deliveries of military equipment are minimal, mainly consisting of spare parts. The new radical-left/right government has however signed a major deal with Lockheed Martin in the US for 500 million a couple of months ago. The new government also resisted demands by its creditors to further cut military expenditure. The far-right defense minister is obviously interested in military contracts.

The German shipyard is the global leader for conventional submarines with about a hundred in service around the world. The Greek government was in arrear with payments in 2006 and claimed technical problems so as not to have to honor the terms of the contract. The submarines were later approved by the German navy. The Greeks then leaked bribery charges involving the minister of a previous government. It is unfortunately impossible to sell in corrupt countries without bribes. All companies including Airbus, BAe, Lockheed, etc. do it. 

The Germans also invested in a Greek shipyard to build three of the submarines and update others. However, due to the breach of confidence, the Germans cancelled the contracts for two submarines sold most of their holding in the Greek shipyard and went to Turkey to build submarines there. The loss of business and jobs to Greece is far greater than the bribes.

German arms exports represent less than 0.5% of total exports. The arms exports to Greece are below 0.1% of total exports. The Germans don’t need to export arms, but in the past there was no legitimate reason to deny export licenses to a Nato and EU member.

It's still their debt. Buy-out of creditors does not annul the commitment of the debtor. 

&gt;Why should they?

Because you should do the things you promised to do, such as paying back the money you owe? 

&gt;received loans from the central European nations to prop up their banking systems - not because it was a generous/right thing to do - but because German (mostly) banks held huge amounts of periphery debt on their balance sheets

Let's assume this is true. Doesn't change anything. On one side you have self-interested people who want to get the money they're owed, on the other you have self interested people who don't want to pay it back. So I go back to my question: ""Are we supposed to forget about that money and the good it will do because we are not yet as broke as you are? ""

&gt;Had the Germans not propped up the banking systems in the periphery, they would have faced their own catastrophic banking crisis which would have led to a need to recapitalise their own banks.

They have every right to buy out the debt of their banks. Moreover, if, as you claim, a major crisis was looming if they didn't, they had a moral obligation to. They had the money, they did it. Where, in this, was greece in any way spoiled? 

&gt;As appealing as your 'household budget' view of economics might be, austerity doesn't mean that.Austerity is an ideology to dismantle worker's rights, state institutions and political and economic sovereignty.


Is this supposed to be an objective definition? 

The reason the ""household budget"" view is appealing is because it's common sense. Giving it a name does nothing to explain why it is wrong. 





&gt; Shitting all over the Greeks is not just missing the point, it's akin to turning around and shooting an orphaned child in the head. 

Oh nooo, not the metaphor of the orphan who gets shot in the head! Does he have big, tear-filled eyes? Is his disabled  homeless surrogate mother pleading with god as she holds him in her dirty arms? Because I'm almost convinced. I must be a monster for giving my opinion on greek debt.

null,false,NoMoreLurkingToo,GREE,Greece,null,"&gt;That's the proposal to the institutions from end of June. Thank you for the link, but I've already read the whole thing a week ago. This was supposed to be the compromise in order to receive more funds. It's basically what they thought those institutions would like to hear.




It was the last proposal from the Greek government to the institutions before negotiations broke down. There is no newer proposal by the Greek government than this (made public at least). This is the proposal they hoped the institutions would accept as a common ground solution.




&gt;But it is a) rather vague (everything besides the pension reform and some budgetary measures is left open and even those seem more like a patching up than a serious effort to tackle fundamental problems), b) short-term oriented and c) obviously not the party's long term vision but just the result of the negotiations with the creditors.




a) There seem to be exact figures for each point, hardly vague I should think. What exactly makes you think it is vague?




b) The proposals are to be fully implemented by 2020 and remain in place indefinitely (unless a revision is deemed needed by both sides I guess). The measures to be implemented would steadily produce results in the following decades, hardly short-term oriented. And in any case, equivalent to the ones proposed by the institutions.




c) True. More on that later.




&gt;I've listed some questions I had in another comment here - I'm particularly interested in industry and business reforms (i.e. *α)* what type of industry do they aim to attract, *β)* who will finance infrastructure, *γ)* what to do with the trade balance deficit, *δ)* what's the development strategy and things like that).




α) What was hinted at was that the construction industry could be restarted using the offered EU funds that Greece would be allowed to tap, with reduced own budgetary contribution to be agreed with in the final proposal. These are funds going to all peripheral countries for development but which Greece had no access to during the last 6 years because of not being able to afford *any* budgetary contribution. So all the funds went to other peripheral countries that could afford to contribute their 10% of each project's budget (such as Bulgaria and Romania).




β) The EU fund together with the Greek budget contribution




γ) Good question, especially in view of the sanctions against Russia. Finland is facing the same problem. Remains to be seen I guess.




δ) See next.





&gt;Is there any manifesto that provides some clarity on issues like that? Because that proposal doesn't and I, personally, think that whether or not to comply with some bail out criteria is certainly an important issue, but the fate of Greece's future will be decided by providing sound economic reform in order to turn that awful recession around for good. That's what I expect a party to have a vision on.





Well, you are very correct to point out that SYRIZA has not produced (to the best of my knowledge) any such manifesto, at least in the form of a written, concise booklet that I could refer you to. But as stated above, bits and pieces were hinted during interviews and the entire mentality of this leftist party is contrary to such measures in a philosophical level (anti-capitalist), enough so as to create internal upheaval if found to be too ""reactionary"". So it could be a combination of calculated neglect and actual neglect...

null,false,VERTIKAL19,GERM,Germany,null,"&gt;It was to swap the private debt that we had with EU debt supported by EU citizens. This is something at least criminal. EU leaders decided to save the German and French banks that had the debt of Greece and get this burden to EU citizens shoulders.

That is not what that was for. That was to not allow the financial crisis to escalate even further and lead to a crisis worse than 1929. Not only would have not doing this have led to greece defaulting and the greek banking system probably collapsing but this probably would have caused this to cascade onto the other european countries and ultimately the donfall of the euro. 

Also this did help greece. It cut the interest rates by quite a big margin and allowed the debt to become more managable. It did make the greek debt more sustainable simply by virtue of creating an interest that is far far below of what greece could have actually gotten on the market. 

Also a loan is obviously not free money, but low interest rates makes it comparably free. Where else do you think greece would have gotten money? Would you have preffered the euro zone falling apart? Would you have preffered escalating the crisis of 2008 even more to the point where even political stability in europe is at stake?

Also you raised the point of debt. Yes everyone has debt. Germany has a debt of 2.2 trilion euro which is way higher than what greece currently has. But what really matters is debt to gdp and where germany has a gdp of 3.4 trilion euro greece has a gdp of 238 bilion.",null,0,null,1436051638,null,0,false,0,cssdc2x,null,t3_3c4lo3,null,t1_cssdc2x,null,t3_3c4lo3,null,null,null,1437589158,null,26,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,26,null

Now the problem is that spending WISELY as you put it, is complicated. If it were simple there wouldn't be as many schools of thought and PhD thesis on the subject.

Remember the low salaries flow into the economy, because poor people can't afford to make savings. So cutting already lower salaries removes capital from the economy and promotes recession. 

Also remember some people are in desperate situations. Unemployment is huge so sometimes there's a small salary for many. Others had prior compromises before the crisis, like house payments. Excessive cuts, can cause a profound social crisis, that will be a further burden to the state.

Don't oversimplify what is very complex.

null,false,TheEndgame,NORW,Norway,null,"&gt; Road quality is good relative to the national level, and in many cases surpasses a lot of places in terms of traffic being low, since it's relatively calm. 

That is in no way true. Roads in the north are horrible. After living in the south i don't understand how people accept it. They're getting fucked over so hard by politicians down south and the public roads administration.[ Guess who gets the least amount of asphalt this year despite having the largest area to cover](http://www.tu.no/samferdsel/2015/04/18/sjekk-kartet-her-kommer-det-ny-asfalt-i-ar)? 

And then it's the railway that is non-existent. Nordlandsbanen is still not electric yet and probably will not be for decades ahead.

The distances also make it hard to find cheap plane tickets. Often you need to stay over for a night in Oslo which easily make the trip several thousand kroner more expensive...

&gt; Easier to commute up north than down south, that's for sure.

It really depends on where you live.

&gt; IT-wise infrastructure isn't a problem, and nor is cellular coverage.

Cell coverage is 2-4 years behind the south. We only recently got 4G...

&gt; saying they're bad is something, but what in particular drags them down?

They don't have a lot to offer and to be honest they are ugly. Full of 60's architecture and lack of green-spaces. They are also far away from eachother. You can't really take a daytrip to a larger city.

&gt; Worthwhile mentioning how while housing are magnitudes cheaper up north, the wage difference isn't remotely as high as the housing costs?

This isn't true either. [Only Oslo is the exception](https://www.ssb.no/kvadenebol). Housing in Tromsø is for example insanely expensive.

&gt; Right now it's shitty, but that greatly depends on the season!

Which is annoying. When i'm in the south i know that we will have weeks, even months with 20+ degrees in the summer. Here it's a question if you get a week with 20 degrees at all. Not to mention when it actually gets warm there is insects like mosquitos everywhere!

&gt; Plus, we have midnight sun -- and that's something I absolutely love every damn summer I spend up north. 

I find it annoying to be honest. But sometimes it's nice.

&gt; What is a bit lengthier than intended is not to say that the north is on par with the south in terms of exports, nor necessarily growth.

Actually they are. [Nordland is very high on exports](http://www.ssb.no/144569/fastlandseksport-etter-produksjonsfylke). Which is great, but i just imagine that living in the north would be much more enjoyable with proper infrastructure and cities. 

&gt; . However, I'd hope it is a slight chance that I could convince you that the regional situation isn't remotely as black and white as you seem to have imagined, especially not when you say it's better in pretty much every way.

It's mostly because of politicians to be honest. The climate wouldn't be an issue if the region was as developed as the south. Politicians always talk about ""nordområdesatsing"" but they don't really do something. Rather they do the opposite like closing military bases that employ a lot of people. Sweden is often used as an example of the horrors of centralization. In reality Northern Sweden and cities like Kiruna and Gallivarre looks much better than cities in Northern Norway. Nice and well kept houses, greenspaces and roads/railways.

&gt; Perhaps you're currently in the middle of a smaller district, far away from a smaller city with proper fiber access and similarly?

Not really. I'm in Harstad and have access to a 100/100 fiber connection. Kind of helps as i'm stuck inside for the summer if the weather keeps being this bad.

I find it sad that things have turned out the way they have. Northern Norway is probably the most beautiful region in Norway, yet it's been neglected for years. Hopefully this will change, but for the moment i'm convinced the south is the better place to live. That is my opinion after having lived both places. Feel free to disagree!

&gt;Open Letter from ISI on matters related to judicial proceedings in Greece

&gt;The ISI has published an open letter regarding the judicial proceedings in Greece against Mr Andreas Georgiou, the President of ELSTAT, and comments from two former ELSTAT members about the  organization of an Open Meeting entitled ‘Intrusion of the judiciary in the course of the production of official statistics’ during the World Statistics Congress in Hong Kong. 
Dated 16th September 2013

&gt;The ISI issued a Statement to express its profound disappointment and serious concern over the prosecution of Mr Andreas Georgiou, President of the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) and two of his ELSTAT Managers.

&gt;Supporters are invited to endorse the statement by subscribing here. The names will be published on the website.
&gt;Dated 28th February 2013

&gt;Letter by the ISI President to the President of the Hellenic Statistical Authority, Mr. Andreas Georgiou, in support of his endeavour to comply with the high international standards for producing good quality and impartial statistical information about the Greek economy and society.
Dated 5th January 2012

http://www.isi-web.org/images/news/20130304ISIGreece-Statement.pdf

&gt;Mr Georgiou was appointed by the Greek Parliament in 2010 to help with the production of reliable Greek statistics. He has a background with the IMF and is fully aware of the importance of the integrity and trust in official statistics to the effective governance of countries. The public finance problems of Greece were due in part to poor and erroneous statistics over a number of years which meant that the seriousness of the situation was not addressed earlier with less austere economic and social policy adjustments. The poor state of Greek public finance statistics before 2010 is spelled out in a Report on the Greek Government Deficit and Debt Statistics, published by the European Commission in January 2010.

&gt;Assisted by Eurostat, the statistical authority of the European Union, Mr Georgiou and his team at ELSTAT went about their work to recompile Greek public finance statistics in accordance with the standards of the EU. Eurostat monitored this work and endorsed that it conformed with EU rules and standards with which Greece as a member of the EU is obliged to comply. Eurostat has published the Greek public finance statistics compiled by Mr Georgiou and his team without reservation biannually for five consecutive times. In a recent public announcement the Director General of Eurostat said that Mr Georgiou retains his full confidence. Further the Director General emphasized that Eurostat refutes allegations that the deficit of 2009 was over-estimated or that any pressure was put on ELSTAT to falsify data.

Now what was it that you said?

&gt;Andreas Georgiou the then head of ELSTAT who was a political appointee with no proper background in statistics

oh and

&gt;The head of ELSTAT at the time probably did that because he was a political appointee chosen by Germany to serve German interests and screw over Greece. Nikos Logothetis says Germany protected him. 

Yes, I'm sure Eurostat and the ISI are part of an overweening German conspiracy against the poor, humble and honest people of Greece. I don't actually think it's humanly possible for me to be any more i) sarcastic and ii) utterly contemptuous of your outright lying, fabrication and denial.

null,false,greco2k,null,null,null,"&gt;but there would have been nothing preventing the EU from bailing out the banks that were exposed to Greek debt rather than taking that debt on themselves and then having Greece collapse.

I think everyone, including the German government, has stated that the bail out of Greece was to stem contagion in the southern periphery. From that perspective, letting Greece default would have been disaster. That is the established dogma. 

&gt;Greece is a small player in the EU economy - barely a blip on the radar.

Again, Germany does not need Greece for economic reasons, but for geopolitical reasons.

&gt; I also think there is proof that countries act altruistically many times 

Compared to just about every nation in the world, Germany goes to great lengths to support the plight of refugees. I don't think Germany is evil or bad. I think Germany is a fantastic country. I think Germany's government (considering that it occupies the center of power in Europe) is a big disappointment. While they do great for Germany, I think they do a lousy job for Europe as a whole. It seem more and more apparent to me that Germany wants to reap the benefits of its position without bearing the responsibility of its position. This is not about giving money to Greece. I don't think Germany has a responsibility to do that. I do think Germany's insistence on reforms has been the right thing. My problem is that a country with such power and influence should have taken a stand against the trend of people (government and media alike) of making this a moral issue. There was certainly corruption and certainly people living a high life on borrowed money. But that does not describe the majority of Greeks. Calling all of them lazy because they voted for governments who turned out to be corrupt betrays the Germans mental laziness since they are so willing to operate in stereotypes, caricatures and scapegoating for an issue that is vastly more complex...and actually much worse than such blanket accusations. But that would require a willingness to learn...and that...is utterly absent in these vapid debates.

The slogan """"More defence for less money"" is little more than an effort to make a bad concept appear more reasonable than it ever would be. 

The cost of retraining troops across the EU to identical kit would be enormous, for a UK infantry man the training cost is approx. £34k, while a fast jet pilot is around £4m. The member states have around 1.6m military personel, all of which would require retraining of some kind. This is in addition to the costs involved in integrating the 27 HQs the EU has, along with their different logistical concepts. 

This is an extension of the Athena mechanism, and that has never worked well. Member states meeting their agreed targets has been abysmal, it consistantly underfunds and under staffs missions. Operation Althea (Bosnia) struggled to provide 1200 of the planned 2200 troops, Operation Atalanta (anti-piracy) went a ship short and the EU mission in Uganda training soldiers for Somalia could not deliver a single medical officer across the EU to care for the trainers.

There's also a shortfall in deployment ability, conscripts aren't well trained enough for missions abroad, regulars across all states lack a common tongue to be able to take part in operations (This is as true with NATO missions as EU ones), a large amount of equipment isn't upgraded enough to work abroad and many nations lack entire categories of weaponry. 

The effectiveness of EU forces needs to be increased, and it can be done via an improvement of Athena, but rather than doing that quite sensible step the idea now is for a central budget and command to bolster an ineffective, inefficient and uneconomic system. Basically we're being offered an alternate poor way of doing things but cheaper. It's institution building for it's own sake, especially as the EU is not a defence organisation.

If you took two minutes to understand the composition of Greek debt in the context of my point, you wouldn't pose a question like that.
#[Composition of Greek Debt](http://www.bloombergbriefs.com/content/uploads/sites/2/2015/02/WhereGreeceCanFindIt.pdf)

Institution | €bn | % of Total
---|---|---
European Financial Stability Facility | 141 | 44.9
Greek Loan Facility: Mostly EZ Government Loans | 53 | 16.8
Private Investors | 55 | 17.5
ECB | 27 | 8.6
IMF | 24 | 7.7
Other | 14 | 4.6
**Total Greek Debt** | **315** | **100**
Greek Debt not funded by Private investors | 260 |82.5

Had the majority of that €260bn been used to finance a state bank and industrial development policies instead of socialising the debts of private institutions, you wouldn't be asking irrelevant questions about whether or not private investors would be willing to buy Greek government bonds. 

&gt;Austerity = Government can't afford to spend that much. 

No, friend. It might suit your agenda to portray things this way, but it's intellectually dishonest and downright wrong to do so. When the Allies turned Germany into a wasteland after WW2, what did the young Federal Republic do? 

They certainly couldn't afford to spend billions on rapid re-industrialisation projects, and yet they did so. They paid for the loans which enabled this through a series of agreeements which ensured repayments only when they experienced *export surpluses*. The US, UK and France (who were the creditors), didn't drip-feed their banking system money and insist on a series of punitive, disastrous economic policies as their economy further degenerated to the point of being utterly crippled - all on the basis of some hack populist ideology which equates national economies to matters of personal thrift.

&gt;Greece, Ireland and all the other countries don't understand that austerity isn't a bad word, it isn't an unnatural construct .. blah blah blah 'my understanding of macroeconomics amounts to personal-finance analogies'

The rest of the PIIGS (well, PIGS as it relates to Europe) have gotten their houses in order, but Greece has not.

I am not sure what the reason is that Germany needs Greece?  So that they don't align themselves with Russia?  Or as a front on the Mediterranean and a gateway to Turkey?  An export customer?  I just don't see it, and whatever benefit Germany and the EU get from Greece isn't lost if Greece leaves the EU.

I also think it's a bit naive to think the German government should be acting in the best interests of the EU where they diverge from the best interests of Germany.  There's a reason the member countries ceded certain powers to the EU and retained others - if they wanted it to be EU first, they would have formed the EU that way.  

I know a lot of Greeks and they are very hard working and kind people, I like them very much.

Money doesn't sit in one place or another, it moves around constantly. The limit on government spending when that government has its own currency is not any particular figure or % of GDP. Limits are only imposed by the interest rates you have to pay on government debt (more spending means higher interest rates) and the risk of inflation.

After 2008 governments did take on huge debts to bail out the European banking system, but worse, tax revenues collapsed as unemployment soared and consumer spending fell. If the government borrows to build infrastructure it can turn a profit (for the country as a whole), raise productivity, and create jobs. Jobs are created directly and then those employees have more money to spend, which creates more jobs in shops and so on.

So your problem is that you don't understand either the concept of unsustainable debt or default. 

&gt;I see, you would have preferred ... absolutely no help at all? We are not Greeces bank

Absolutely. Greece like Iceland woud be in a much better situation today if they had defaulted on their private creditors in 2010. ""Help"" that reduces the GDP by 25 percent and brings unemployment up to 25 percent, while increasing the debt to GDP ration to 180 percent is actually the opposite of ""help"". it's willful destruction. They are in a worse situation today than they were five years ago.

The euro is a deathtrap. 

&gt;I would not lose a single cent in any case. I specifally wrote ""Greece will pay their debt"".

How? Are you going to make them? Either the debt will be restructured or they will default on all of it. Of course it seems extremely unlikely that a ""Aufstocker"" would lose any money in that, so yeah you are most likely safe. Still, the rest of us will have to pay for irresponsible bankers who loaned to incompetent Greek gevernments in Greece. There is no way around it now. That will be socialized.

That's why France drinks more alcohol per capita than some beer-happy countries, because the French drink wine all the time, and don't only binge-drink on weekends. 

There's no comparison to the US, even California, in that regard. So making the French vineyard tradition, or specific regions (especially world-reknown Champagne) a world heritage makes perfect sense under the rules of UNESCO.",null,0,null,1436055274,null,0,false,0,csseuni,null,t3_3c4tio,null,t1_csseuni,null,t1_css8pur,null,null,null,1437590451,null,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16,null

Irrelevant.

&gt; So your problem is that you don't understand either the concept of unsustainable debt or default.

I understand both perfectly. You seem to be of the opinion that ""Default"" means ""Won't pay, ever"", which is wrong. It means ""Won't pay **now**"".

&gt;Absolutely. Greece like Iceland woud be in a much better situation today if they had defaulted on their private creditors in 2010. 

Possibly.

&gt;Help"" that reduces the GDP by 25 percent and brings unemployment up to 25 percent, while increasing the debt to GDP ration to 180 percent is actually the opposite of ""help"". it's willful destruction. They are in a worse situation today than they were five years ago.

There was a bit of growth last year, but now they fucked it up again.

&gt;How? Are you going to make them? Either the debt will be restructured or they will default on all of it.

Defaulting does not make the debt go away!

&gt;Of course it seems extremely unlikely that a ""Aufstocker"" would lose any money in that, so yeah you are most likely safe. Still, the rest of us will have to pay for irresponsible bankers who loaned to incompetent Greek gevernments in Greece. There is no way around it now. That will be socialized.

You are very funny, but they will pay.

You're wrong, I addressed this elsewhere in the thread by discussing Odious Debt:

&gt;[In international law, odious debt, also known as **illegitimate debt, is a legal theory that holds that the national debt incurred by a regime for purposes that do not serve the best interests of the nation, should not be enforceable.** Such debts are, thus, considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the regime that incurred them and not debts of the state. In some respects, the concept is analogous to the invalidity of contracts signed under coercion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odious_debt)

The Greek debt doesn't serve the interests of the nation, nor the interests of the European taxpayer. It serves the interests of those whose private losses were socialised.

&gt;Because you should do the things you promised to do, such as paying back the money you owe? 

Not according to international law. Besides, you're spectacularly missing the point again. Germans loan money to Greeks to enable them to socialise losses in the Greek banking system. Both Germans and Greeks are paying for the socialisation of private debt - yet you choose to get pissy with the Greeks and not the EU politicians in both Germany and Greece who pushed to enable this? Cop yourself on.

&gt;Let's assume this is true. Doesn't change anything. 

Don't be insulting. I made a series of points backed up by easy-to-read sources from academics. You respond by saying 'let's assume this is true' and then reiterate a series of muddled, asinine thoughts leading to a logical fallacy without giving any consideration to the points previously made. Until you afford me the same courtesy, I'm going to do the same.

&gt;They have every right to buy out the debt of their banks. Moreover, if, as you claim, a major crisis was looming if they didn't, they had a moral obligation to. They had the money, they did it. Where, in this, was greece in any way spoiled? 

Under the terms of Odious Debt, the government arguably didn't have the right to do what they did. Further, they didn't have a moral obligation to do anything. Many on both the left and right would argue that they had a moral obligation to let the banks fail, and from their ashes, create a new banking system and/or a state bank.

&gt;Is this supposed to be an objective definition? 

Adorable. Somebody who thinks that objectivity exists. No, it's not 'objective', it's a serious of indisputable observations. 

&gt;The reason the ""household budget"" view is appealing is because it's common sense. Giving it a name does nothing to explain why it is wrong. 

The reason the ""world is flat"" view is appealing is because it's common sense. The world isn't flat and national economies aren't households - claiming either only tells everybody that you don't know anything about the subject you're opining on.

If Greece defaults the debt the debt doesn't magically disappear. In a normal sovereign default, the cuts occur from the country agreeing with its creditors to take cuts and work from there. But reality is that Greece already did this back in 2012 and the proposals for cuts ever since have been rejected, defaulting or not will not change this fact... You will not have any cuts if you default with the IMF, ECB and the EZ. 

Second not only will you get no cuts, you will have to pay them in Euros, no matter the currency you adopt. And this is a major issue.

Greece imports a lot more than it exports, meaning they pay more than what they recieve so any new currency will be under constant pressure to devalue.

This does not account the disorderly issuance of a new currency that in itself will mean heavier austerity than what you have ever known... Meaning a value cut of at least 40% on the day of its issuance and constant depreciation as the greek government rushes to pay it's internal spending.

But the worse part... You're out of the Eurozone... No more oversight, no more incentives for transparency of your government, no more accountability to other powerful organizations.

null,false,texdeveloper,UNSA,United States of America,null,"I do not understand a lot about economics and there is much about the recent events of Greece I do not know about. I do understand about making house payments to the bank. Which really has nothing to do with the actual situation but please overlook my horrible analogy. Perhaps someone can correct me where my story goes wrong, below.

Say I bought a house, and I know that even if I stop making payments on it, that no one can really take the house away from me. But if I stop making payments on the house then its hard for me to buy food, medicine, and electronics like computers. So I still make payments on the house and I work very hard to make my money. My mother-in-law, for reasons I cannot explain in this story, takes some of my money each paycheck so I don't have as much to pay for the house  payments. I still want to pay for some other things besides the house, and I know a nice gentleman down the street who is willing to loan me some money to help me make my payments. The loan is cheap enough that I can easily deal with the interest payments each paycheck. Several years go by and its not very easy to pay the nice gentleman, and I have to ask the neighbours for help. They pay off the money lender - I can still make my house payments but now I have to pay them a lot every month as well as still make the house payments. They know about my mother-in-law because they gossip about her, but still leave it up to me to put my house and family in order. Also, I am a bit scared of my mother-in-law, and its easier to just keep doing the same thing as before. No one wants to deal with her when she is upset. But, there is now not enough money to deal with all four things at once: food, house, neighbours and my mother-in-law. Everyone tells me I have to talk with her (I think she has a gambling problem). I talk with her, and she promises to do the household chores  more, but the issue of her taking my money is not really addressed. The neighbours still help me out some because if they don't then the neighbourhood suffers (Some of them work in the stores where I shop for food, medicine and electronics and they need me as a continuing customer). However, soon enough I am having problems paying everyone again. Now, my cousin moves in and says: ""Don't worry about the neighbours, just don't pay them back, and let me deal with your mother-in-law"".  This sounds really , really good, and I take him up on his word. 

Now, I have a choice to make: 

a) If I stop paying the neighbours I can suddenly have more money to shop with, but since the neighbours sell me stuff they are going to get mad and increase the price of the food they sell me. So while I can make the house payments, I will not have enough money to pay for the other things now. So, even if my cousin can make my in-law stop whatever she is doing, I am going to have real trouble making all the payments , and there is going to be a bunch of hardship.  

b) I face up to my in-law and hope my cousin helps me. I know it will take some time to make her change her ways, its not as simple as my cousin says it is, but I know after a long time it can be done.

Both options will make life hard. Which do I choose?


Edit: I really did not know how to account for inflation and reduction of value of the drachma, so I had to invent angry neighbours. And the in-law is corruption, and bad taxation, and the other drains. The cousin is Syriza, of course. The house is Greece itself and the neighbours are the other countries.

Regime in international law is not a term used solely to describe undemocratic forms of government, although the concept of odious debt is most often used in this context. Here's [a UN text](http://unctad.org/en/docs/osgdp20074_en.pdf) that's worth reading as an introductory primer to the concept. Whilst the definition hasn't been explicitly pinned down, and much of it discusses transitions from undemocratic to democratic regimes, it certainly doesn't stipulate that it is exclusive to this relationship.
&gt;(1) The new Government would have to prove and an international tribunal would have to ascertain the following: 

&gt;a) That the needs which the former Government claimed in order to contract the debt in question, were odious and clearly in contradiction to the interests of the people of the entirety of the former State or a part thereof, and 

&gt;b) That the creditors, at the moment of paying out the loan, were aware of its odious purpose.  

&gt;“(2) Upon establishment of these two points, the creditors must then prove that the funds for this loan were not utilized for odious purposes – harming the people of the entire State or part of it – but for general or specific purposes of the State which do not have the character of being odious.”

There should be a globally acting transparent scientocracy with a fluid government of proactive citizens from all around the world.

If you have the academic merit (proven by *at least* a transparent test that is administered regularly and can be taken for free by all world citizens) you are allowed to enter the government and take part in the suggestion and decisionmaking process. 

If the decisions you support lead to good results in the long term, your future votes and suggestions for policies get more weight and you get more representative functions.   
This will lead to a constantly updated point system.      
The success will be measured by constant public feedback by the world's population.   

Democracy in this system will be used as a feedback system, not a system for determining representatives.    
All *decisions* will be put to a public and transparent vote and public satisfaction will be measured based on whether or not the people like it.

For example: Did you like the elimination of A and that X, Y and Z were implemented as a consequence in form of Amendment B? Yes/No.   
If the public opinion is ""Yes"", then all politicians who voted ""Yes"" will get points contributing to the weight their next decision has.    
All politicians who voted ""No"" will see a decrease in points and their next vote will have less weight.   
What the maximum/minimum amount of weight of a vote is remains to be determined.  

As the system is scientocratic, this feedback system and the weights only concern things that do not have a scientifically optimizable solution (e.g. moral/ethics questions, military questions, etc.). For all things that have a scientifically optimizable solution, scientific evidence is the only argument and scientific consensus dictates policy.


There you go, a better alternative made up on the spot. (Seriously, our current systems are just utterly horrendous, so many different things would be superior. The generational system of Chinese politics is actually a very far-sighted thing, especially since the law has arrived that politicians can be held responsible and get prosecuted for their decisions in office if they jeopardize the future of the country (even after they retire), so even that is preferable to our current systems.)",null,1,null,1436057101,null,0,false,0,cssfkjz,null,t3_3c4vyw,null,t1_cssfkjz,null,t1_csse8kr,null,null,null,1440500085,null,-6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-6,null

I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this is not true. In Bismarck's system most of the money given to the government is not stored anywhere, it's used directly for paying the rent. Your children pay for your pension. It doesn't have to involve any additional investments. The key is the generational renewal - two children for two parents.

Why is it that? Because never the return from stock investments (and they give the best profit) will provide you enough money to beat the inflation and obtain a pile of money when you're 60. I don't think that in a long term it's possible to get more than 10% year (and still without inflation and taxes). Even 2% inflation will eat half of your money!

This is a bullshit argument. Germany (or NL, or Finland) are not endangering themselves AT ALL. Germany lent Greece some 50 billion euro. A lot of money? Sure. It is also equal to the *profit* of the top 10 german companies (not the income, just the profit). Or the fortune of the two (!) richest Germans.

&gt; how so? ISIS is active in Europe. 

Yes, they are going to assault Berlin any day now, following Stalin's footsteps.

&gt; But is Egypt better off? No. It's also torn apart and also muslimic. Their military will probably wander off like Iraq's military did.

You should really read up on Egypt. Useless to discuss about it when you have the notion that Egypt is anywhere near post-war Iraq or mid-civil-war Syria.

They have 500.000 active personnel (highly laic, anti-extremist and united) and 1.000.000 more in the reserve. A relatively modern air force: 220 F16 alone, supported by Mirages, C130 and Apache Helicopters, even AWACS and drones. More than 1.000 modern Abrahms tanks (and close to 2.000 heavy Soviet tanks). Artillery, comm systems, navy, etc. Oh, and the support of the US, Russia AND China. And on top of that ISIS has no border with Egypt to attack from.

&gt; that is true but to my knowledge Pesh are experienced fighters. I like to think that that's mostly the reason ISIS is losing to them

What *wars* have they fought in? Egypt has been at war with Israel every few years in the 20th century. Yes, they lost most of them (never successfully occupied Israel) but never ran away. The Peshmerga have done some guerrilla activity but this is the first all-out war they fight in. The Peshmerga have a maximum 200.000 soldiers, some 170 medium size and outdated soviet tanks and 4 helicopters, which are not even armed, just for transport. Their main weapon is infantry and Toyotas with machine guns or AA guns on the backs, and they are holding back ISIS along a huge border just fine.

ISIS has 0 chance against Egypt. ISIS has actually 0 chance against Jordan, a county with a military 10 times smaller than Egypt and with whom they share a border. ISIS has absolutely nothing, zilch, nada, chance of getting close to any country in Europe (excluding suicide terrorist attacks).

null,false,talideon,CONN,Connacht,null,"&gt; You should have defaulted like a US state.

Except that's not how things work in the US. A state default in the US is nothing like a default of an independent country, even a member state of the EU. Keep in mind that a US state isn't funded solely from taxes collected within its borders: it's also funded from federal taxation and transfers. So even if a US state was to default, there's no way it could collapse quite the same way as a sovereign state.

The EU isn't a federation, and asides from thing like structural funds (which are a pittance compared to federal transfers), there are no equivalents of thing the US federal government does taxation- and transfer-wise, and there are no EU-wide bureaucracies that people deal with on a day-to-day basis like there are in the US. For instance, unlike the US, social security/protection/welfare is done on a member state basis, whereas in the US, it's dealt with federally.

It's been over 150 years since a US state defaulted. City defaults, on the other hand, happen more often in the US. Consider the situation if, say, Berlin's government defaulted: that's closer to the situation with a US state? Even if the state government defaulted, the other states via the federal government would still make sure that the city remained functioning. An EU state defaulting is a much bigger deal than that for those in it, and, because there are no real mechanisms for helping smooth over the roughness, a much bigger deal for other Eurozone states: the Greeks have their hands tied behind their backs are far as what they can do to fix their economy because they're in the Eurozone, and for the rest of the Eurozone, they're basically a deadweight.

The Greeks were required to absorb the impact of their bank collapses alone. That wouldn't have happened in the US.",null,0,null,1436058230,null,0,false,0,cssfzyt,null,t3_3c4lo3,null,t1_cssfzyt,null,t1_css9d3d,null,null,null,1437591379,null,51,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,51,null
null,false,tessl,null,null,null,"&gt;a) There seem to be exact figures for each point, hardly vague I should think. What exactly makes you think it is vague?

No, there aren't. Only the ""pensions"" and ""additional paramedic budgetary measures"" sections provide some insight on concrete figures. The rest of the document contains many empty phrases. I'll give you an example:

- ""Implement measures to fight tax evasion and fraud and to strengthen enforcement by enhancing tools such as garnishments""

Well.. what measures? How do you strengthen enforcement? This point could mean everything or nothing. The whole document is written like that (except those two sections mentioned above). I ask you to read the paragraph on ""Labour markets"" - actually an extremely important issue. Read those 13 lines and tell me what exactly they want to implement. It does not contain any substantial content.

&gt;hardly short-term oriented.

Yes. My mistake. Should've explicated what I mean by that as I think it is an important complaint of mine: This document, as mentioned above, was written to appeal creditors in order to extend the programs. As such, it only focuses on achieving debt sustainability because that's one of the most important criteria for creditors. Those measures are aimed to balance budgets right now because creditors demand that. However, budget is only one measure that needs to be tackled. There are plenty of other (rather long-term) issues like growth strategies or productivity gains that are not touched here. This is why that document doesn't say anything about their vision, it's only a proposal how to solve the debt issue within a short time horizon.

&gt;α) What was hinted at was that the construction industry could be restarted using the offered EU funds that Greece would be allowed to tap, with reduced own budgetary contribution to be agreed with in the final proposal. These are funds going to all peripheral countries for development but which Greece had no access to during the last 6 years because of not being able to afford any budgetary contribution. So all the funds went to other peripheral countries that could afford to contribute their 10% of each project's budget (such as Bulgaria and Romania).

I don't think that is true. [According to the EC](http://epthinktank.eu/2014/05/07/structural-and-cohesion-funds-in-the-member-states-an-overview/allocations2014-2020/) Greece is indeed recipient of structural funds for the new 2014-2020 program. Furthermore Greece was [the second biggest net recipient of EU funds in 2013 (in the dropdown menu choose ""Operating budgetary balance"")] (http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm).

However, thank you for the construction sector hint - although I'm not quite sure how supporting a cyclical sector like that will help fighting a recession.

&gt;β) The EU fund together with the Greek budget contribution

Does this imply a complete default (as in zero debt left which I don't think would be possible) because otherwise there would be debt left to refinance which the budget is probably not capable of and the structural fund is not allowed to.

&gt;Still a better choice than any other option in the Greek political system, sad to say...

Well.. I'm not arguing for or against some other party either. Don't even know what they stand for. I'm just a little anxious about the long-term game plan involved here.

That would pay for a lot of tax breaks and welfare programs in our countries. Are we supposed to forget about that money and the good it will do because we are not yet as broke as you are?

The Banks should have taken their losses in 2011 instead of giving Greece the largest loan in human history to a defaulted state. Now they have swapped that debt and loaded it onto German and French, etc citizens. 

Now Greece is fucked because these loans went to complete waste, as 92% of it never entered Greece itself but went through this debt swapping scam so the bankers got away without harm. 

The issue is not ""debt forgiveness"", the main campaign of Syriza is NOT to get the debt wiped away like you or some others may believe. The most ""radical"" proposal they have is to get the same terms Post-WW2 Germany received. Which is to link Debt payments to Greek export surplus. 

This has a two-fold advantage as not only will all the debt be paid, but in a healthy way. Foreign investment can begin to enter Greece again since the EU would want to grow Greek exports to pay back the debt even quicker. IMO, this is a win-win since not only is debt handled well but both Greek exports and foreign investment can grow, which is exactly what Greece needs right now.

No there wasn't. What happened in Greece is that prices were falling faster than nominal GDP leading to an increase in real GDP while having a negative impact on debt to GDP since here the nominal number is the one that matters. So, deflation was higher than the drop in nominal GDP leading to minimal positive change in real GDP. Even if they had 25 more years like that their debt to GDP ratio would just soar. While their unemployment problem wouldn't get much better.

How does that prove anything at all? The markets consider German bonds to be more creditworthy. I could just as easily use it to prove my point. Hell we could have no Euro and that would still be the case.


&gt;Well, Portugal just handled the crash of its biggest bank last year. Why is it up to all of the EZ to save German and French banks (and Portuguese would be in dip shit too, to be fair). And why isn't that reasoning applied to Greece? 

Most of the EZ bought out the money their banks put in Greece.
How much foreign EZ debt does Greece or its banks hold?

&gt;This article was written in 2012

.

&gt;The Fund’s mission is to save countries, not currencies or banks, and it certainly should not be doing dirty work for a rich currency union that is fully capable of sorting out its own affairs, but refuses to do so for political reasons. 

edit: let's preface this by saying that I'm relatively biased against this guy because to me he seemed very much like the much more educated version of the guy at the bottom of this thread with his ""Always say no to the EU. Don't give them a mandate to override sovereignty.""

I didn't read word by word but the first part where I disagreed is here. I fully agree the IMF fucked up initially &amp; is still fucking up at the moment from a Greek perspective. But I don't agree with the reason why he thinks that is.
The IMF is not there to support the currency union (which this guy is very much against and just shoves in there to further that point) it is there to answer to it's members. To be a last resort for failing economies whilst still getting it's money back or it'll have some though explaining to do those members who are the central banks many of which in the EZ &amp; as he said controlling seats on the IMF board. 
Many of which also want back the money from those loans (some of which they took over from their banks).
There could be no Euro and they'd still be answering to those.

The IMF &amp; ECB align here. Not because the IMF is some slave to the evil currency union but because they need to do their job.

According to this guy the IMF should ask the creditors for debt relief. He must know that this isn't going to go well. Even if the best option for Greece others won't shoot themselves in the foot for them or at least won't do so anymore.
Every country able to on their own did took a shot downwards because it was best for them &amp; those that couldn't set things staight with some help. No help that required charity from others but help non the less.

Except for Greece. They fucked up and suddenly they couldn't, the initial help couldn't and eventually after dragging it out even more help couldn't either.

Maybe the other ECB members could have been or can be forced  to take a real hit for Greece's fuckup if the currency union was properly executed with some more clear cut &amp; more independent central control but let's be real here that's what this guy would have campaigned against at all cost.

&gt;This article is recent

Oh joy. forbes.com/sites/     
Let's see. So the gist of it is why are these guys not admitting that Greece is bankrupt &amp; giving up their money.

Regardless of the claim that Greece is doomed to bankruptcy in every possible way which I won't comment on he's asking some pretty though questions. Hmmm why do they not throw their money in the toilet?

He doesn't mention the option of debt relief and stimilus so it can eventually pay back but let's say he did I'll repeat who's gonnastand for that? Outside of the ECB or IMF there's no real options for lending, those evaporated and the options they're left with would want certainty before they'd even consider anything. They're already under fire by the nations they answer to for putting in so much &amp; Greece has never managed to give any certainty. Now both sides have turned it into such a long stretched out standoff imo that at this point there's a very good chance whatever money spend after a partial debt cut that Tsip still might hope to force is also going down the drain &amp; I don't think the referendum helps in that regard.",null,0,null,1436059226,null,0,1436060043,0,cssgddw,null,t3_3c4lo3,null,t1_cssgddw,null,t1_cssetb5,null,null,null,1440500042,null,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8,null

But Ireland was told ""You got the wrong answer"". Try again. Good lad. Another election later after all of europes bought off leaders chastised them , seemingly Ireland changed their mind. 

Bullshit conspiracy theory, and I'm tired of hearing people spout it as if it were the complete truth, so here goes:

[Exit polls showed that the reasons they voted no were completely different than what you say](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/post-vote-poll-1.1268589):

&gt;Don't understand /not familiar 	40%

&gt;Protect Irish identity 	20%

&gt;Don't trust politicians/Govt policies 	17%

&gt;Protect neutrality 	10%

&gt;Keep commissioner 	10%

&gt;Protect tax system 	8%


If you don't trust a single poll, [a *second* poll corroborates this](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_245_en.pdf):

&gt;Because I do not know enough about the Treaty and would not want to vote for something I am not familiar with 	22%

&gt;To protect Irish identity 	12%

&gt;To safeguard Irish neutrality in security and defence matters 	6%

&gt;I do not trust our politicians 	6%

&gt;We will lose our right to have an Irish Commissioner in every Commission 	6%

&gt;To protect our tax system 	6%

&gt;I am against the idea of a unified Europe 	5%

&gt;To protest against the government's policies 	4%

&gt;To avoid that the EU speaks with one voice on global issues 	4%

&gt;Because large Member States decide on EU matters 	4%

&gt;To protect the influence of small states 	3%

&gt;It would allow the introduction of European legislation in Ireland, such as gay marriage, abortion, euthanasia 	2%

&gt;To avoid an influx of immigrants 	1%

&gt;The EU does not need any fixing, it works fine 	1%

&gt;Other 	14%

&gt;Don't know/not applicable 	3%

These polls show that the majority of people voted ""No"" because they were not informed or didn't understand it. Some raised important issues with the treaty, like regarding taxation and their traditional policy of neutrality, as well as their loss of a guaranteed Commissioner.

With these polls, [Ireland renegotiated the Lisbon treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-eighth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_Bill_2008_(Ireland\)#Second_referendum):

&gt;In the meeting of the European Council (the meeting of the heads of government of all twenty-seven European Union member states) in Brussels on 11–12 December 2008, **Taoiseach Brian Cowen presented the concerns of the Irish people relating to taxation policy, family, social and ethical issues, and Ireland's policy of neutrality**. **Effectively Ireland's position was renegotiated**, and the revised package was approved by the electorate in 2009. Because of the Irish financial crisis it was also apparent that Ireland would need increased financial support from the European Union.

&gt;The European Council agreed that:

&gt;* the necessary legal guarantees would be given that nothing in the Treaty of Lisbon made any change of any kind to the Union's competences on taxation for any member state;

&gt;* the necessary legal guarantees would be given that the Treaty of Lisbon did not prejudice the security and defence policy of any member state, including Ireland's traditional policy of neutrality;

&gt;* the necessary legal guarantees would be given that neither the Treaty of Lisbon (including the Justice and Home Affairs provisions), nor the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, affected the provisions of the Irish Constitution in relation to the right to life, education and the family in any way;

&gt;* in accordance with the necessary legal procedures, a Decision would be taken to retain Ireland's Commissioner, provided that the Treaty of Lisbon was ratified;

&gt;* the high importance attached to issues including workers' rights would be confirmed.

As you can see, most of the complaints were resolved (ignoring the people who simply voted ""No"" because they didn't know what the treaty was about), and people who had previously voted ""No"" voted ""Yes"".",null,0,null,1436060242,null,0,1436060682,0,cssgqno,null,t3_3c5g7z,null,t1_cssgqno,null,t1_cssf3z0,null,null,null,1437591969,null,18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,18,null

&gt; Kölns erster Coffeeshop soll im Juli öffnen

&gt; ERSTELLT 23.06.2015

&gt; Ganz legal Gras kaufen in Köln? Das soll schon Anfang Juli möglich werden. Hinter der Aktion steckt Forensiker Mark Benecke. Die Sache hat allerdings einen Haken.  Von Philipp Remke

&gt; Bald soll es in der Kölner Bar „Zum Goldenen Bock“ Gras zu kaufen geben. Ganz legal. Denn am 3. Juli soll in der Kneipe in der Nähe des Hansaring Kölns erster Coffeeshop aufmachen. Die Eröffnung wird auf Facebook schon fleißig beworben. Bei der Feier dürfte es allerdings ziemlich eng werden: Mehr als 2.600 Gäste haben sich bereits angekündigt.

&gt; Wer jetzt allerdings auf eine legale Verkaufsstelle für Marihuana hofft, wird enttäuscht. Hinter der Aktion unter dem Slogan „Support your local dealer“ steckt der Kölner Ableger der Satire-Partei „Die Partei“ von Martin Sonneborn. Den „Dealer“ gibt deshalb auch deren Kandidat für die Kölner Oberbürgermeisterwahl, Dr. Mark Benecke. „Wir sind bei allen fortschrittlichen und coolen Aktionen die Ersten“, so Benecke auf Anfrage von ksta.de: „Und immer ganz nah an den Wünschen unserer Wählerinnen und Wähler.“

&gt; Und er präzisiert auch gleich, was da über den Tresen geht. Benecke: „Nur von unseren PARTEI-Ladies handverlesenes und von mir persönlich getestetes und in meinem Labor geprüftes und freigegebenes Qualitäts-Gras.“ Oder genauer gesagt: Rasen oder Wiese „aus Kölner Grünanlagen“ wie es auf der Facebook-Seite der Veranstaltung heißt. Der OB-Kandidat verspricht sogar eine sozialverträgliche Preisgestaltung: „Schüler und Studierende bekommen es bei Vorlage ihrer Ausweise billiger.“

&gt; Die witzig gemeinte Satire-Aktion hat einen realen Hintergrund: Seit mehreren Jahren gibt es immer wieder Anträge für die Einrichtung von Coffeeshops in Köln oder der Umgebung. Sogar der Kölner Innenstadt-Bürgermeister Andreas Hupke unterstützt die Forderung nach Cannabis-Clubs, in denen legal gekifft werden darf. Die Stadtverwaltung räumt dem Vorhaben allerdings keine Aussichten auf Erfolg ein.

&gt; Can you elaborate on that. Whilst I agree that countries like Germany profit from a 'weaker than would otherwise be' currency I believe the other economies got rather good rates on their loans due to countries like Germany sharing their currency.

And I showed  yields. 

&gt; How does that prove anything at all? 

Well you claimed yields were low due to sharing currency with Germany, and I showed you yields exploding.

&gt; The markets consider German bonds to be more creditworthy. I could just as easily use it to prove my point. Hell we could have no Euro and that would still be the case.

Exactly. 

My point was not that Greek yields were worse due to the Euro (not directly anyway). I think this is the confusion. 

The problem with the Euro, for weaker economies like Greece, is that it is overvalued for them to be competitive outside the EZ, and because it's common in the EZ it also doesn't allow them to compete with stronger EZ economies (not to mention they can't devalue it to pay debt). 

The lack of control over own currency and the disadvantages that come from it, can and should be offset in a number of ways. And this is where a fiscal/transfer union comes in. In particular common debt (like US treasuries, the so called Eurobonds) allow for some balance.

Greece has gotten but a pittance, but it has paid a high price to preserve these countries’ banking systems.

Ah, come on, not this rubbish again. The money has ""gone to private banks"" because that's who the Greek government borrowed it from. Borrowed it, and spent it, in Greece. *All* the money Greece owes was spent *by* Greece, not by the bloody tooth fairy.

The money being loaned to Greece by institutional lenders and other governments divides into two parts - money to repay what Greece already spent, and more money for Greece to spend.

Indeed, we did in 1929. Things changed a bit in 1933. If you think that the recession in 2008 and its aftermath was just as bad in Greece and in Germany you are being silly.

While more may be ggod on charts it is not always true. More unemployment -&gt; bad. More debt to GDP - bad. 

Tell me how those fewer Greeks are supposed to in the future pay for their ever increasing debt? They won't It either needs to be restructured or they have to default on all of it.

null,false,modomario,BELG,Belgium - Flanders,null,"&gt;Well you claimed yields were low due to sharing currency with Germany, and I showed you yields exploding.

The crisis happened &amp; yields exploded that should be obvious. Germany still gets more out of it because they're more credit worthy. They didn't have the problems Greece or Portugal had. Hence I said this doesn't proof anything

Before the crisis took a big downturn they profited a bit from having Germany &amp; co around after they still did during the crisis or those yields would have been even higher. For Greece it's ~~becoming~~ troublesome because the certainty of the ECB covering their ass is slowly dissapearing.

There's a reason Greece suddenly had access to a lot of cheap credit after they joined. I don't think you can deny that.

You said ""strong economies earn a shit ton of money by lending it to weaker economies at obscene rates.""
I'm just going against that specific statement. 

&gt;The problem with the Euro, for weaker economies like Greece, is that it is overvalued for them to be competitive outside the EZ, and because it's common in the EZ it also doesn't allow them to compete with stronger EZ economies (not to mention they can't devalue it to pay debt). 

I agree that it's a disadvantage &amp; I think that is where the strong economies mainly profited but I don't think that a more competitive exchange rate is a wonderbrew that will allow their economy to become more competitive relatively fast as some seem to claim. In fact I think the costs there will outweigh the benefits by far at least now we're at this point.
Maybe pre crisis this could have been different but then again nobody wanted to leave then and you certainly didn't hear the Greek gov complain about the cheaper credit which I claim they had to being in the EZ. They shouldn't have been let in so early.

&gt;The lack of control over own currency and the disadvantages that come from it, can and should be offset in a number of ways. And this is where a fiscal/transfer union comes in. In particular common debt (like US treasuries, the so called Eurobonds) allow for some balance.

I very much agree here. I've been wanting this for a long time now.

In hindsight, it's not a tactic I'll be using again - as everybody seems only too delighted to assert that the basis of my argument is hinged directly on this, which clearly it isn't.

And you do realize that for Greece to determine their debt as such in legal terms they would have to at the very least prove that they were actually a dictatorship. And I mean a *genuine* dictatorship, not a democracy where voters just keep voting in idiotic governments.

Greece could have defaulted, with all the repercussions of it. But it could not have avoided said repercussions through the in this instance entirely irrelevant theory of odious debt.

&gt; Socialising private debt does not serve the best interests of Greece, or any European nation. It serves the interests of private investors on Wall St., Frankfurt, Paris and the City of London.

Private debt was made. The options are defaulting or repaying it. Greece repaid it with the help of loans from the EZ. That's what ""socializing the debt"" means. That does not mean that no money was spent, it means that Greece was given an opportunity to get its shit together instead of being forced to straightup default in the middle of an economic crisis.

&gt; Instead of imposing austerity on Greece, Ireland, Spain etc. a much better option would have been to allow the banks to fail and use the trillions already spent on recapitalising these failed institutions to create a series of state banks with the explicit goal of funding infrastructure development and industrial projects.

So we would have a bunch of countries in the middle of defaulting while the banking sector is in flames, the economy is falling to pieces and as such loans are more difficult to get for everybody else. And you want to *invest* money? Pray tell, with what fucking money would you do that?

Also, just how exactly do you want to run these state banks?

&gt;The media has systematically ignored and buried coverage of polls conducted within Greece by reputable non-Greek firms such as Gallup International, whose pan-European end-of-year survey in December found that 52% of respondents in Greece favor a return to a domestic currency, or Bridging Europe, whose March 2015 poll in Greece similarly found a 53% majority in favor of leaving the euro, and whose most recent poll found that 63% of Greeks are not afraid of grexit. Instead, the international media and even left-wing media outlets and scholars ranging from Noam Chomsky to Tariq Ali, have repeated the myth that a large majority of Greeks want to remain in the Eurozone. Similarly, these media outlets have largely ignored the findings of the “debt truth” commission and have completely ignored the aforementioned ELSTAT allegations.

Wrong. See [this comment with UN documentation source.](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c4lo3/hello_fellow_europeans_i_am_writing_to_you_as_a/cssfcml) I use it mainly as a rhetorical device to frame the debt in a different context - so if you want to pendantically argue over it , I'm not really interested. The point about socialisation of private debt stands.

&gt;Greece could have defaulted, with all the repercussions of it.

In a simplistic world, you're right. In reality, you've clearly forgotten what happened in 2011 when Papandreou tried to call a referendum on a new bailout. Being given ultimatums and having an incompetent government forced into making snap-decisions without a requisite period of time for deliberation isn't democracy, and it certainly isn't representing the will of the Greek people. The choice was 'accept or go bankrupt' without an alternate plan for unwinding - that's not a choice, that's coercion. 

&gt;Private debt was made. The options are defaulting or repaying it.

I'm talking about recapitalisation of the banking-system, not repackaging Greek bonds into EFSF/ECB/GF loans. You've missed the entire point of that paragraph.

&gt;So we would have a bunch of countries in the middle of defaulting while the banking sector is in flames, the economy is falling to pieces and as such loans are more difficult to get for everybody else. And you want to invest money? Pray tell, with what fucking money would you do that?

Oh, I don't know. Maybe the €~260bn that has already been loaned to Greece by the Troika.

&gt;Also, just how exactly do you want to run these state banks?

Like magical candy stores, where everybody gets free cookies and gobstoppers wrapped in €50 notes. What part of *state bank* do you find perplexing? The ""State"" or the ""Bank"" part?

&gt;Only financing things and not actually making a profit does not seem like a viable business model 

Here you disingenuously assume that state banks will only finance projects that aren't financially viable. So, well done to you for conducting this exchange on the basis of bad faith.

I can't say that they don't, but if US companies get caught at it subject to 1977, when the US cracked down on this:

&gt; As a result of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigations in the mid-1970s, over 400 U.S. companies admitted making questionable or illegal payments in excess of $300 million to foreign government officials, politicians, and political parties.[5] The abuses ran the gamut from bribery of high foreign officials to secure some type of favorable action by a foreign government to so-called facilitating payments that were made to ensure that government functionaries discharged certain ministerial or clerical duties.[5] One major example was the Lockheed bribery scandals, in which officials of aerospace company Lockheed paid foreign officials to favor their company's products.[6]:10 Another was the Bananagate scandal in which Chiquita Brands had bribed the President of Honduras to lower taxes.[citation needed] Congress enacted the FCPA to bring a halt to the bribery of foreign officials and to restore public confidence in the integrity of the American business system.

...they will be punished:

[Wikipedia: Foreign Corrupt Practices Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Corrupt_Practices_Act)

&gt; The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA make it unlawful for a U.S. person, and certain foreign issuers of securities, to make a payment to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person. Since the 1998 Amendment of FCPA they also apply to foreign firms and persons who take any act in furtherance of such a corrupt payment while in the U.S. The meaning of foreign official is broad. For example, an owner of a bank who is also the minister of finance would count as a foreign official according to the U.S. government. Doctors at government-owned or managed hospitals are also considered to be foreign officials under the FCPA, as is anyone working for a government-owned or managed institution or enterprise. Employees of international organizations such as the United Nations are also considered to be foreign officials under the FCPA.",null,0,null,1436068026,null,0,false,0,cssjo8h,null,t3_3c4sqd,null,t1_cssjo8h,null,t1_cssd0bm,null,null,null,1437594371,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

Of course for ""US faced with a Greek-like crisis"" we only have to look at Puerto Rico right now. For tax reasons US investors have showered cheap money on Puerto Rico, rather similar to how German banks gave cheap money to the Greek government because they thought the ECB would always be there (or because they were just morons, it's not clear.)

However Puerto Rico is still in the first phase of the Greek-crisis: the debt is still all owned by banks, retirement funds and the like. It's possible the US will bail out Puerto Rico in-part to ensure these investors don't lose their money, sort of like what the Eurozone did with Greek debt in 2010. However I doubt the US will then use the debt as a cudgel to beat Puerto Rico into submission (I mean it helps that Puerto Rico is literally a colony so the US doesn't have to seek extra-legal means to make Puerto Rico comply, Congress could just pass a law if they wanted to do something.)

null,false,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,null,"&gt; I know what you're saying, though. I've dealt with my fair share of bad data sourced from government agencies and it's almost never fun. My point is more: it's not that it wasn't known, it's more that no one cared for geopolitical reasons.

To be honest, I don't think one even needs to cite geopolitical reasons, since I don't think that applies to euro membership in the same way it applies to EU membership. I suspect that because really checking the likely state of the books would indeed be hard, and could not be done for Greece alone (politically, singling Greece out for such scrutiny would have been a non-runner), it was not done beyond the most basic level for any country. 

Given that Eurostat is the primary statistical service for the EU, and that Eurostat published Greek figures as provided by Greece (admittedly with a methodological caveat), I'm pretty certain that national figures were basically taken as true, whatever  reservatons the statisticians may have had about them. Seeing something like this in the Convergence Report for Greece (that is, the report on Greece's readiness for euro entry) reinforces that view:

&gt;However, vulnerability could arise from continued high debt if slippages in the country’s fiscal performance were to raise the perceived credit risk of public debt. Further improvements in the transparency and quality of statistical data would strengthen the monitoring of fiscal developments.

Those two observations basically describe the root causes of the Greek crisis, and the market shock it produced, along with making it fairly clear that the source for convergence criteria statistics about Greece was Greece.",null,0,null,1436068690,null,0,1436097839,0,cssjx4h,null,t3_3c4lo3,null,t1_cssjx4h,null,t1_cssj6pw,null,null,null,1437594542,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"Indeed, sadly I believe a big part of that resulted because of how romanians identify themselves, our ideology, even though so many people ignore that as a fact. There is a reason we are the ""latin"" island in a slavic sea. And yes, I know some genetical tests say we're rather greek ( probably the initial population), or logically it seems more normal for us to be slavic, but it doesn't change the fact that romanians identified and still indetify themselves as latin. And that mattered an awful lot in the grand picture.

You see, communist and fascist ideologies didn't come in romania before the WW2 ( like in most countries), between the war we were a democracy ( one of the good times of the country actually), the fascist ideology came as a result. We were allied with Poland, France was our main ally, after the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, seeing what happened with Poland ( being in the exact same position ), and a lot of territorial changes culminated with a Russian ultimatum on current Moldova, the nationalism rose, naturally. This resulted in a fascist rule which allied with the Nazi, but even if this can give an excuse to the facist ideology, there is none for the communist one. Mainly because it didn't exist, it was not widespread at all, communist ideology was very week in romania, but a group of people used the opportunity of ""romania losing the war"" and the russian troops in the country to make a coup d'etat and give a communist ideology ( and ally us with the allies, they're ""positive"" excuse), but it was basically just becoming Russia's colony. 

Sadly, different from other nations around which consider themselves ideologically relatives of Russia, Romania did not, and it was also an enemy of Russia historically almost in every century. Ironically enough, the only nation in a similar situation to us was actually Hungary (amazing how many things we have in common and still have all this stupid hate), but you were a bit luckier by being at the margin of the alliance, having your former ally Austria as a neighbor, having a democratic example of sorts in them, and this fear (to Russia) of turning against and having access to a form of aid from the west at a fast pace, or at least the chance to run out in a way. 
In romania this was not the case, we had to be kept in the union, under the boot, but romanians identified as latin, they considered the italians, spanish, portugesse and even french as cousins (if not brothers), if a romanian ended up ""visiting"" those countries, he would only want to live like that too, to live under a democracy. This was a problem, a risk, Romania always had this western tendency, wanting to be were our ""relatives"" are, or being approved  by them ( which even now creates a huge inferiority complex which kinda pisses me off about my country ) and this made it a risk ( again a bit different from Hungary who kinda ""had no one like them"" so it wasn't such a risk. Thus we were a big risk and threat to the system, thus we had to be kept under control, thus intellectuality and every critical sentiment had to be destroyed. 

Maybe it was also a bit of revenge for the war, maybe at least that part we deserved a bit, but it doesn't make out for all the atrocities, after all Romania took a side in the war because they were forced by Russia ( we wanted to be neutral, but you saw how that went for Poland ). 

And now you can understand why Russia is the most hated country by romanians (yep, even above Hungary which is more of a rival really in modern times). Of course, together with other reasons, and this is coming from me, whose love of his life is russian ( god i hope she never reads this :)) ) and has Russian friends ( I study in a german uni).

Sadly that's the past, but it did put us in the current economical situation, which as Greeks have to pay for they father's sins, kinda put us like that too, generations having to suffer for their predecessors, sadly in our case, it wasn't even our fathers' fault ... they had no choice either, mostly one of the many results of WW2 :( ",null,0,null,1436068922,null,0,1436069649,0,cssk07r,null,t3_3c4vyw,null,t1_cssk07r,null,t1_cssea6d,null,null,null,1437594611,null,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12,null

null,false,spacefarer,null,null,null,"&gt; You don't get to decide how to use other people's money.

As person who lives in a federalist union, this is one of the things that I think many Europeans misunderstand about the way such unions operate. 

When you have states that are politically sovereign and spending money of their own accord, and those same states belong to a fiscal union, they are each individually making financial decisions for that whole union.  That's how it works.  

But the flip side of this is that sometimes the union needs to make decisions together to handle problems. For instance when an American state fails financially (as California nearly has a few times, and as many cities have), the Federal government bails them out, pretty much no questions asked.  Sure they change out who runs it, and they make suggestions for how to handle it differently in future, but the critical thing is to return to normal function as soon as possible. The moral judgement of ""You were irresponsible"" just isn't there, because it is understood that the present government there is likely not responsible at all for the present state of affairs, and that in the end it doesn't even matter who's at fault.

The EU has only very weak mechanisms for this kind of collective action.  There is no Federal government to make the decision to bail out Greece. There isn't even a confederal government (see [federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation) vs [confederation] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation)) Instead the individual states say ""it's not *my* problem,"" when in fact it *is* their problem; it's everyone's problem. That's what union means.

What the EU framers failed to understand is that when you bind your economies together, you sometimes have to make decisions together, political decisions.  This means that the economic union must come with a political union (at least to some degree).  The EU lacks this (for understandable reasons), and that is the source of this current unpleasantness.",null,0,null,1436071048,null,0,false,0,csskrrb,null,t3_3c3gkq,null,t1_csskrrb,null,t1_css52bm,null,null,null,1437595209,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

And that mattered an awful lot in the grand picture.

And here, folks, is the offspring of the nomenklatura in which idetifies itself slavic than romanian. Faust would rather be a russian/slavic than romanian. Now, he posses as a victim, he apologises for the russians. Heck, he self-loathes so much that he'd rather be with a russian than a romanian. Ironically, he studies in Germany (Vienna Award II memento) and has a love life with a russian (Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact memento). Now you can see, either a shill or an idiot who'd rather spit on the graves of our ancestors. 

Now you see what's the problem with some of these new offsprings in our nation: look at Faust and his anecdotal ""historical accuracy"" filled with smiley-faces (the facebook generation, mind you); giventh, not written, from the local bar or from his shallow communist parents.

He is the elected leader who now must choose between two (or more) evils. He inherited the losing end of a massively asymmetrical power imbalance. In the best of times, this would be difficult. That combined with confronting a destroyed economy and an angry, resentful, divided population -- makes it near impossible to ""be competent"".

**What would you have him do? Or done?** There is just no answer or solution for Greece that would make him appear ""competent"".

The issue here is that Germany/EU/IMF has all the power and Greece has very little. The right thing that SHOULD happen is Greece's debts be mostly forgiven and all wounded parties learn from the mistake.

In the future, we will all agree that austerity was a terrible, dysfunctional idea. But in the meantime we all pick sides and get inflamed/irrational about things because of ""our principles"".

The referendum was the right thing to do, that alone tell me Tsipras has some integrity. It's just a shame that integrity is not enough in an unforgiving, hostile, abusive relationship like that which now exists between Greece and the rest of the EU.

As far as I am concerned it's ""lender's risk"". Greedy people risked their money and lost it. Welcome to capitalism arseholes. Suck it up, and don't spitefully break the arms and legs of the person you lent money to, just to ""make a point"". It's just so sick and wrong what has been done to Greece, and what will *be done* to Greece in the future. Austerity is so clearly completely wrong and illogical and not supported by ANY examples of it ever working, in fact the opposite is true -- you spend money during hard times and save it during the good. This has proven good results. Austerity is arse-backwards regressive thinking, yet now the EU/Germany wants to punish Greece for the EU's own failed, dysfunctional policies.

The sad reality is that the large majority of Greek citizens, similarly to Italians, do not want change. Ask the majority whether retirement ages should be raised and you get a detailed explanation as to how they have worked their whole life and paid taxes. The sustainability of such things is rarely considered.

While I am sad because I have an idea what will happen next (you will remember the time of austerity as happy days), at least you won't maybe blame the whole world for your fate anymore - it will be your choice.

The root cause of all of your problems is spending more than you earn. A lot more.
The rest is just a consequence and  additional errors.

You are right that you were not the only one in Europe but you were champions at it and arguing ""they did it too!"" is very childish. I hope other nations will learn from your example and stop borrowing money in the time of grow.

At the same time I am angry at the European politicians - they should have let you default back in 2010. OTOH they couldn't expect the success of Syriza, that rendered all you previous sacrifices useless.

Many of the austerities you find drastic are normal in other European countries, I don't quite understand why you should be something special.

It's sad the nation with such a long tradition keeps being deceived by communist and Marxist ideas.

Non siamo fatti con lo stampino, ci possono essere uomini molto sensibili che rimangono e si sentono uomini, e donne maschiaccio che cmq sono donne. Potrei anche essere vagamente daccordo sull'idea che certe attività sono viste più come da uomo o donna per ragioni culturali... la cucina è l'esempio classico... anche se continuo a pensare che i lavori più sociali e più tesi alla cura di qualcuno siano tipicamente femminili per motivi biologici e non sociali (stessa cosa per i lavori più aggressivi o faticosi, e gli uomini).

Their economy has shrunk by 1/3, instead of limping along flat like the rest of the EZ. That alone explains the difference between 120% and 170%. At 170%, they are doing better than Ireland, Portugal, and Belgium, and are neck to neck with Spain and the Netherlands. Interest rates do not tell the whole story. I could buy a great property at low rates and drive it into the ground. Everyone should be able to agree this spread is the direct result of austerity, ie horrible terms on the loan. If not, I am afraid your emotions are influencing your economics. Bad move. It does NOT matter who is to blame. There needs to be a real solution. Anything else is not economics, it is just posturing.

Instead of pushing for austerity, the Troika should have focused almost exclusively on tax reforms--ie on getting people in Greece to pay their fair share. That would have allowed for increased revenue without tanking the economy. Greece needed tough love, but one that was thought out, not just politically expedient. No doubt some governmental reforms were required, but is has become the old mafia loan situation: ""Paying all you have in interest to me? No problem buddy, I have a line of credit open for you to cover that! Eventually we'll need your first-born, just cover your eyes and don't think about it"". The Greeks did not just stop working in 2010, they have been forced into this hole.Once again, not by interest rates, but by thick-headed loan terms.

The Troika was warned and warned and warned by nobel economists that this was going to be the outcome. Just as when they allowed Greece to cook its books (of course they did, give me a break), now again they are acting with their heads in the sand about the future... There is a reason that the US and the IMF are singing a different tune than the EU on this one. Because the EU is seeking to maximize returns rather than help Greece.

At this point there is absolutely no good solution for Greece. They have been sucked dry. The vote today is on which is the least toxic poison. They all know this, and the vote in Greece is about survival, not pride or greed.

I agree, that the greek corruption was the main reason for the situation you are in now.

It won't be something that is solved overnight but will take a longer time. The best chance for that and Greeks economy as a whole would be, if syrzias proposal would be accepted.

I use it mainly as a rhetorical device to frame the debt in a different context - so if you want to pendantically argue over it , I'm not really interested. The point about socialisation of private debt stands.

No, it doesn't. You were arguing in favor of a default by framing said default as ""not actually a default"", which is still nonsense. It is not possible to realistically talk options while you argue that effectively declaring the debt illegal and as such erasing it without effectively having to default is possible.

&gt; I'm talking about recapitalisation of the banking-system, not repackaging Greek bonds into EFSF/ECB/GF loans. You've missed the entire point of that paragraph.

The bailout programs were the recapitalization. That's the point. You can't have one without the other.

&gt; Oh, I don't know. Maybe the €~260bn that has already been loaned to Greece by the Troika.

That would have been freely available while the banking sector was on fire and the economy everywhere would have suffered, and that no country would have invested into itself to represent the interests of its own people (that would have been under severe pressure due to the previously mentioned further escalated economic crisis) while Greeks, Spanish, Portuguese etc. were starving on their respective streets.

The part where you're burning down the economy for something that already exists and does not stop investment banks from existing and causing trouble.

&gt; Here you disingenuously assume that state banks will only finance projects that aren't financially viable. So, well done to you for conducting this exchange on the basis of bad faith.

No, here I assume that you're trying to innovate and actually attempt to solve long standing issues instead of basically going back to he way it was before but doing more damage to the European economy and citizens in the process because ""muh banks"".

&gt; Then you proceed to equate state banks with communism, which tells me that you don't know a whole lot about the latter but are great at concocting logical fallacies.

The thing that sunk Greece wasn't some shady machination no one knew about. The government was very publicly taking on relatively short term debt to pay long term obligations like pensions and government salaries. Everyone who takes so much as 2 seconds to think about this knows why it's disastrous.  Taking a loan to pay for something that might make money in the future is a reasonable investment. Taking a loan to pay for something that not only has no chance of generating a return but will just add up costing more and more over the years, like pensions, simply adds interest on top of an already huge expense.

The people knew about the government's gross inefficiency. They knew about people in government jobs hired do to nepotism, that most agencies had 40% of the employees doing 100% of the work, of phantom jobs where the person doesn't even exist and the money goes to someone else.

None of this was a secret. People knew about it, accepted it and even took advantage. You see, politicians in other places also have access to closed door technology, but they don't get away with doing shit like this because you can't govern locked in a room. A functional country has people who are willing to punish their representatives for sacrificing the long term for the short term. People who understand that corruption and inefficiencies are a cancer that needs to be cut out, not a way of life, or a tool to be used.

Not much I think? The Greek situation has (understandably) been at the center of the news all week and it's the holidays so journalists don't have many other things to report, except telling us it's really hot.

- **It's getting hot in here**.

High temperatures throughout the country, all week long.

- **Charles Pasqua died: he was the french interior minister under Chirac and then under Balladur**. (Heart attack, at 88).


Good guy because: he joined the resistance during WWII at age 16. Fervent Gaullist, he was very attached to the soveignty of the state and people also liked the fact that he would not mince his words (old style politician that becomes rare nowadays).

He also campaigned against the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.

Bad guy because: had a lot of corruption affairs behind him. And was friends with a lot of right-wing corrupt politicians. Never really convicted... As the interior minister, he also has a responsablity in police violence that resulted in the death of an innocent student who was just participating in peaceful protests.


- **The Cour de cassation grants surrogate children legal recognition. (Surrogacy remains illegal in France).**

I haven't followed this extremely closely, so this was about two particular cases and I'm not sure this applies to all the other children (precedent), but I think that's it.

 Basically until then, babies born from surrogate mothers abroad (where it's legal, since it's illegal in France) weren't recognised, not legally tied to their parents. Now they will be: they won't suffer the consequences of an illegal act performed by their parents and thus will be able to lead a normal life, have french papers, etc... But, again, the practice of surrogacy is still illegal in France and will likely remain illegal in the next 5 to 10 years. Complex issue, but I think most people agree with this decision: it's for the good of the chilren, who aren't responsible for what their parents did.

(As you know, when France was discussing gay marriage two years ago, maaany people protested... well these people are still vocal and have turned their fight towards the issue of surrogacy. It has absolutely nothing to do with the gay marriage law, but they keep imagining that our government plans on legalizing this practise, although it's been stated numerous times that that's not the case at all. So, even though the issue of the legal recognition of the children is probably understood and supported by the majority of the french population, the process has been delayed - because a vocal minority keeps saying it's a way to force the acceptation of GPA (surrogacy) for homosexual couples.

- **The cult satirical puppet show 'Les Guignols' was rumored to be taken down.** But they are spared.

Alain de Greef, former Canal Plus (TV channel which hosts the show since 27 years) died this week. Two days later, the current chairman alledgedly decided to cancel ""les Guignols"". The show is cult, it's less popular today than it was in the 90s, but people are attached to it, and this news sparked outrage (particularly in the context of this year's attack against Charlie Hebdo). Finally the puppets will be spared BUT they may end up being re-scheduled (maybe even from a daily show to a weekly one... which makes no sense) and as a result they may lose a lot of viewers and be cancelled nest year, right before the presidential campaign (the chairman is a good friend of sarkozy's so of course this news is highly political).

Now regarding EU, the problem is that the mainstream politicians have decided to move toward that direction, federalization of Europe and transformation of it to a USE, but the people of Europe where never asked if they wanted to lose their independence. Because the EU started as something very different, and its promise was rather different back then.


The way actions have been taken for further and further unification and federalization of Europe is a ridiculous mess. We are still people who feel belonging to unique nations, speak different languages, have different customes, cultures, but at the same time we can travel from one place to the other without a passport, we use the same currency, and we have to accept laws and rules decided by foreign people, far away from 'our' respective lands.


But there are problems with uniting a continent in such a way, and that is because at different geographical areas of the continent, reality is different, and quite often policies that would be OK and make sense to one part of the continent, would be stupid in another. But the power of the EU politics is concentrated to the central European countries, and the borderline, periphery countries often feel that their problems and local conditions are ignored.


If you take a map of Europe and have a look at which are the countries that lie on the borders of the EU and the continent, you will discover an apalling reality. The most northern country, Iceland had problems, Britain feels it has nothing to earn from the EU too, at the East side you have Romania and Bulgaria that are the poorest countries of the EU, at the South you have Greece, Italy, Spain, that not only have had economic problems, but also unbalanced immigrant importation, at the Western border, Portugal and Ireland also has problems.

This is the system that exists now because of the EU's 'Banking Union', but back then it didn't we didn't have it so the Greek government bailed out banks with money from the budget. Bank bailouts make up about 50 billion (or more) of Greece's debt.




Second dual currency system. Another huge chunk of Greece's debt is actually interest payments. Because Greece has no lender of last resort in the form of a proper central bank they have to rely on selling bonds to investors, when they got spooked during the financial crisis Greece had to pay almost 30% interest! Places like the UK, USA, Japan don't have this problem because the central bank buys their own bonds.




Third cook the books like the all the neoliberal countries do. Split tax/borrowing/spending between various subnational/local levels of governance and various agencies/funds. Make all the unemployed do courses or 1 hour of work a week so they don't show up in the official unemployment figures. Semi-privatize all those pesky things like electricity and water so even though you have to pay for them they're technically not taxes and the employees aren't 'wasteful government spending'.




Forth digitize government records, crack down on tax evasion, discourage the cash economy, modest stimulus program for small business.

null,false,Alithinos,GREE,Hellas,null,"Greece needed reforms IMO, but not that kind of reforms. Basically, the reforms that the EU and IMF have been saying Greece has to do, are of 3 types:

1. Abolition of worker's rights. According to the Troika, growth will come the abolition of things like being paid based on the total amount of hours that you work, and instead they say that having laws that allow the business you work on to always pay you a fixed salary, no matter if you work 8, or 16 hours a day is a good thing. Another reform abolishes the law that said that a business is obliged to give a compensation to someone that gets fired. What this have lead to, is to have businesses hire people for a month, then fire them without paying them a single euro, and hire new people to do the same with them. So businesses get their job done without paying anybody, and people work for free one month and then are sent back to their homes to be unemployed again. Its a bit like slavery, as you work without getting paid, and the difference is that you are not owned by someone.


2. Other type of reforms is for Greece to privitaze public services. This is the kind of reforms Greece resist most to. The Troika says that this is good, but if Greece privatizes some certain public services, there will be private monopolies, and that will launch prices of certain services way too high. When a private business is the only one offering something to the market, it can and will price its product to a ridiculous high price.


3. Another type of reforms has to do with social help to people in need. It says that Greece shouldn't offer medical treatment for example, to poor people that have no money. That has lead to a tragic situation the past years, were people would die from things that are curable for more than a century, because they can't afford treatment. This becomes a very huge problem if 28% of your country's people are unemployed, and thus without money.


4. Corruption has indeed played a huge role in the size of Greece's debt. Most of it is odious. There have been numerous scandals regarding public and other money theft in the past, and I can't possibly write about all of them here. The thing is that Troika's reforms doesn't battle corruption. Those who over-indebted Greece with corruption, are members of the two major Greek parties of the past, PASOK, and New Democracy, that the Troika has been cooperating with the past 5 years. Those repsonsible for the debt burden because of corruption are still free and haven't faced any consquences. Because as long as they were governing, they injected to the Greek constitution a law that gives  them immunity. They made it so the law itself isn't applicable to them by law. And for them to be brought to justice, a new reform of the constitution is needed, and for that to happen it needs 60% of votes in the parliament, that the current government doesn't have. The corruption lords of Greece have stolen several BILLIONS of euros from Greece. Just one scandal, the 1999's Athens Stock Exchange scandal, was about a theft of money that equals to 96.5 billions of Euros that were taken to off-shores. In 1999 96.5 billions were removed by the Greek economy with theft, and those who stole them are still walking free. And there are many other incidents like this. If Greece was let to progress normally, without corruption overlords stealing away money from it and over indebting the state, Greece's GDP right now would be double, and the debt way shorter.",null,0,null,1436080904,null,0,false,0,cssnqrz,null,t3_3c3frx,null,t1_cssnqrz,null,t1_cssmtyr,null,null,null,1437597639,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Basically, the Greek government's position was and is that they won't sign as deal unless it's **RE**-**STRUC**-**TURED**  to make it **SUS**-**TAIN**-**ABLE**. That's it. **THAT** is what Dr Varoufakis is asking .... **THAT**'s '*the vision*'.

Nations are still the most stable form of organized society in the history of mankind. They have a lot of faults, but they're still the best  thing we've got.

&gt; There should be a globally acting transparent scientocracy with a fluid government of proactive citizens from all around the world.

So a global technocracy? So original, never heard it before.

&gt; If you have the academic merit (proven by at least a transparent test that is administered regularly and can be taken for free by all world citizens) you are allowed to enter the government and take part in the suggestion and decisionmaking process.

Academic merit? So a nuclear engineer will write legislation on nuclear energy? Sounds pretty good if you don't really think about it or you've never entered in contact with actual politics. What does an engineer knows about the economical and socio-political situation of the country he's legiferating about? Or you're telling me that all you need to write laws about nuclear energy is knowing how nuclear plants work? So we need to add political science, geography and law to the mix of nebulous academic merits needed to be elected in this scientific utopia. I think you'll have a hard time finding someone fitting the criteria.

&gt; If the decisions you support lead to good results in the long term, your future votes and suggestions for policies get more weight and you get more representative functions.
This will lead to a constantly updated point system.
The success will be measured by constant public feedback by the world's population.

So until we reach the long term, the technocrats have free reins? Also, the idea that your policies and votes and powers have more weight the more positive feedback they receive is based on the fact that every citizen is capable of judging from a technical point of view whether the technocrats did good or not, meaning that all citizens have technical expertise. So why restrict the governing powers with a test? It's clear that in your utopia everyone is well versed in everything, so it doesn't make sense. And the idea that you get reinforced in power from what basically amount to constant popular vote doesn't seem dangerous to you? You think that the average scientist is less corrupted by power and less capable of swaying the public opinion than a politician?

&gt; Democracy in this system will be used as a feedback system, not a system for determining representatives.
All decisions will be put to a public and transparent vote and public satisfaction will be measured based on whether or not the people like it.

That's not democracy, that's oligarchy with a feedback. The fundamental point of all democracy is in the act of electing your representatives, Remove that, and you're not in a democracy anymore. Ever heard of Schumpeter, Kelsen? Their arguments are much more convincing than yours. What if the feedback signals that the people want to go back to the old system? Do you ignore them because you know what's best for them?

&gt;For example: Did you like the elimination of A and that X, Y and Z were implemented as a consequence in form of Amendment B? Yes/No.
If the public opinion is ""Yes"", then all politicians who voted ""Yes"" will get points contributing to the weight their next decision has.
All politicians who voted ""No"" will see a decrease in points and their next vote will have less weight.
What the maximum/minimum amount of weight of a vote is remains to be determined.

Weren't we talking about long term? And you really don't see the fault in this system, where a group of people could simply sway the public opinion by virtue of them having a ton of points?

&gt; As the system is scientocratic, this feedback system and the weights only concern things that do not have a scientifically optimizable solution (e.g. moral/ethics questions, military questions, etc.). For all things that have a scientifically optimizable solution, scientific evidence is the only argument and scientific consensus dictates policy.

What does scientifically optimizable mean? You're playing Thomas Moore, but you keep throwing words around. Scientific evidence and consensus being the only argument is so... Whatever. First of  all, have you ever worked in scientific academia, either hard or social sciences? The academia is one of the most corrupt, prone to logic of powers and shallowness places you can find. It's not a transparent utopia of knowledge, nor it will ever be. Also, who determines what constitutes a consensus? Do we do it by vote? So scientists vote on what constitutes the scientific consensus, perpetuating the same cronyism and partisanism found in academia. Also this means that the general populace is only called to express itself in a small set of situation, and even then, they can't change anything with their vote, just give feedback. I fail to see how this whole mess is democratic, or even rational. Furthermore, who decides which questions are moral, ethical or not *scientifically optimizable* (whatever that means)? The scientists? But they are not expert in moral and ethical questions, that's why we ask the people (and by ask you mean simply giving thumbs up or down, without any way of changing a decision). But then why shouldn't you integrate normal people in the policy-making process? So the scientists are called to decide on things that can't be scientifically optimizable, meaning they have as much expertise on the matter as the every man. So you contradict yourself since you wanted a system where only the experts could govern.

&gt; There you go, a better alternative made up on the spot. 

You mean a technocracy, a concept invented long before you were even born (Comte?) but without any of the intellectual significance. You contradict yourself multiple times, and the system is markedly undemocratic, which raises the question if you even know what the point of democracy is (spoiler alert, is **personal freedom**). If you want efficiency, go live in Singapore, a paternalistic oligarchy.

The EU made a massive error by adopting neoliberal economics as its driving force.

However some things to consider:

In Greece it is difficult (more than other countries) for older people to get work.  They are almost unemployable and discriminated.  Thus if you lose your job or need to change jobs you will have to retire.

1.  The pension goes to support other family members that are unemployed.  They do not have a social security net like the UK.

2.  A lot of govt employees may have been forced to retire due to the cuts.  I dont know if this is factored in the statistics.



If the official retirement age is now 67, I imagine they cant do this anymore.

But yes - its insane and how the other  established parties - pasok and new conservatives accepted this is a reflection of how fucked up the system is.

Greece has actually fired 260.000 people the last 5 years from the public sector. From 900.000 to 640.000. [Here](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/613/1*OlvoLgg1GsnN4k0HRzq-Sw.png) an actual source instead of pulling random numbers out of my head.

What has happened in Greece is an unprecedented collapse of economy and society with the worst depression in the post-WWII western world. It is irrelevant to compare wages at face values without taking into account any tangible factors. Greece's wages have fallen rapidly, [much more than the other adjustment programs](https://data.oecd.org/chart/4k88). And due to price stickiness, especially on basic products, the price hasn't fallen at all or very little. Pensions have been cut by about 45% the last 5 years. [Here](http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2015/02/27/greeces-pension-system-isnt-that-generous-after-all/) about how ""generous"" the pensions in Greece are. Half the population is under poverty line, suicides have increased rapidly and hundreds of thousands of children can't have the food they need with them passing out in school becoming more and more common. There is an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.

Thus it seems that they do not have a clear vision. But this is I believe, because they are open to *any* plan which seems economically good.

ISTANBUL (AFP) - 
Turkish nationalists protesting China's treatment of ethnic Uighur Muslims attacked a group of Korean tourists in the heart of Istanbul's old city on Saturday, mistaking them for Chinese nationals.

Hundreds of angry protesters marched towards the Topkapi Palace on the banks of the Bosphorus Strait in a show of solidarity with the Turkic Uigurs, who complain of cultural and religious suppression under Chinese rule.

Shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is the Greatest), they attacked some Koreans outside the Topkapi Palace, which is visited by thousands of tourists every day.

The tourists were rescued by riot police, who fired tear gas to disperse the attackers, members of the notorious far-right Grey Wolves closely affiliated with Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).

1. You don't register as a citizen, but as a resident. This is your right in any EU country as an EU citizen. Once you're registered you are legally required to have health insurance. Registering for health insurance and a bank account are completely unrelated to being registered as a student. How much you pay for health insurance depends on your work/study situation. If you're a student and don't work more than 20 hours per week you'll pay about 75€/month for health insurance.

2. In terms of jobs: a ""Minijob"" means you earn 450€/month and won't have to pay any taxes or social security contributions. Minijobs are mainly useful if you're a student, because you won't automatically get health insurance with a Minijob. You would have to get your own health insurance, which costs about 150€/month (if you're a student you get health insurance for 75€). If you earn between 450 and 850€/month you pay a reduced rate for social security and health insurance. E.g. if you earn 850€ you keep 675€ after taxes and health insurance contributions, if you earn 500€ you keep 400€.

3. If you study in Germany as an EU citizen you can get Bafög (study grant which you have to pay back partially after a few years). Bafög is usually also available for Studienkolleg. Depending on your and your parents' income you can get up to 670€/month. To qualify, you have to live in Germany for 5 years, but this waiting time will be changed to only 15 months in August 2016. So you would become eligible for study grants 15 months after registering as a resident in Germany.

The banks and investors - eg managers of funds where ordinary people save their money - were then forced to agree to ""restructure"" of greek debt. This ""restructure""

1. converted high rate bonds with short maturity to low rate bonds with long maturity, thereby significantly lowering the debt's value.

2. forced a direct 53.5% haircut to the nominal value of all government debt held by private bond owners. The haircut alone lowered greek government debt by €106.5bn

See, that is actually the problem why the economic truth can't get to work, at least right now. There is no good faith on the creditor side any more. Everybody knows that there has to be at least a debt restructuring, most likely a relief even. So why not tackle the issue? Just as that, they know they will have to fork over substantial amounts of money. But there is no usable collateral left and they can't just tell them, if you don't do structural reforms (and enforce them), we are taking crete off of you. They are twisting their arm in a very hurtful way by keeping the debt alive, so if they need to, they can threaten we will throw you in default if necessary. And judging by the political track record of Greece in the last decades, at least some arm twisting is justified. Granted, this could be done a lot better by tying relief to exactly defined goals, one step after the other. Why they don't use that kind of approach, I have no clue.

Declaring the state debt odious was an incredible dumb thing to do, that alone had to wipe out any good faith left, at least for the current gouvernment.

La prima era piuttosto lercia ma tutto sommato accettabile, a me sul momento era sembrata una fogna perché non sapevo cosa mi sarebbe aspettato dopo. La cose peggiori erano la moquette costantemente umidiccia (su cui la muffa aveva assunto delle proporzioni inquietanti) e le blatte che zampettavano tra i piatti sporchi del lavello.

La seconda era molto più sporca. Peccato perché sarebbe stata anche una bella casa. Un elenco di zozzate che mi viene in mente:

– non c'erano superfici libere, era tutto occupato da bottiglie di birra, vestiti, piatti, libri, posacenere improvvisati, immondizia varia

– il lavello era ovviamente sempre colmo, le pentole venivano lavate solo quando servivano

– nello spazio tra i fornelli e i mobili della cucina si era accumulata una discreta quantità di materiale organico che pensavo potesse prendere vita da un momento all'altro

– in frigo c'era una prepotente quantità di roba ammuffita, una volta ho avuto la malaugurata idea di fare un po' di pulizia e una mia coinquilina ha avuto il coraggio di incazzarsi

– c'era una stanza che avrebbe potuto essere un salotto, peccato che venisse usata da tutti come ~~ripostiglio~~ immondezzaio, sul divano non ci si poteva nemmeno sedere

– il bagno era tremendo, credo non avesse mai visto una spugna. Il pavimento era fatto di linoleum e in certi punti era tutto sollevato, dalle giunture uscivano insetti. E lumache.

La terza non era in condizioni migliori, ma l'interno passava in secondo piano rispetto all'esterno.
C'era un piccolo cortiletto che circondava la casa. I miei coinquilini (tre ragazzi e una ragazza, tutti inglesi a parte me) avevano l'abitudine di lasciare l'immondizia in giardino. Quando sono arrivata io il retro era già completamente invaso dai sacchi della spazzatura, e durante il mese in cui sono rimasta lì avevano iniziato a riempire anche la parte anteriore che dava sulla strada. C'erano sicuramente dei ratti, non li ho mai visti ma i rumori e i movimenti erano inequivocabili. Per fortuna era inverno e la puzza era contenuta, ma non mi spiego l'assenza di lamentele da parte dei vicini. La giustificazione era questa: in quella città c'era la raccolta porta a porta, se la quantità di rifiuti che consegnavi superava un certo tot dovevi pagare una sovrattassa (o una multa, non mi ricordo). Ormai la quantità di immondizia era tale che i miei coinquilini piuttosto che pagare preferivano vivere in una discarica.

You know, the problem is really not about money. The EU has the money, mechanisms and will to keep Greece afloat. The problem is that Greece is not willing to take any steps to fix their issues (High tax evasion, corruption ..etc) 
I've seen all of your finance minister's videos, and I agree with him when he sais that the debt needs to be restructured so it's sustainable, but he offers absolutely no solutions on how to make it sustainable.

The way I see it, Greece wants Europe to bail it out, but still wants to keep doing all the things that got it here in the first place. This is why everyone is angry (and rightfully so)

What the NO voters don't get is that if you refuse EU's proposal, instead of controlled austerity, you will get a big crash AND will be forced into austerity measures.
You really don't understand the risks here. If the ATMs stop spewing money, what you get is panic, riots and a systemic failure of the Greek state.

* Age: The younger the person the most likely they are to vote ""NO"". ""YES"" has an overall win only for the over 55 year olds. At least 15% of the people  between 25 and 54 are undecided.

* Studies: ""YES"" camp wins for primary and tertiary studies,  ""NO"" camp wins for ""secondary"" studies(this includes students) 

* Occupation: ""YES"" has a lead with pensioners, business owners  and self-employed. Everybody else goes for ""NO"". ""NO"" wins in all the groups:

State employees: YES 31%, NO 58%

Private employees: YES 31%, NO 54%

Unemployed people: YES 26%, NO 51%.

* Leaving the EURO:  ""YES"" camp agrees the referendum is about leaving the EURO.  ""NO"" camp does not think the referendum is about leaving the EURO

* Peoples' own prediction: 56% think the results will be close, 33% think it will be a land slide. 50% think the ""YES"" camp will win, 39% think the ""NO"" camp will win. At least 10% of those voting ""NO"" think they will lose.

* Public Issue had asked a set of four indirect questions to gauge overall opinion about referendum. Their own estimation is that overall support for ""YES"" is 47,5% and ""NO"" is 42%

Yet, being Ukrainian, i can disagree as to the role the Troika played in the (lack of) reforms. 
UKraine has been the same for the last 20+ years, the story is exactly the same: corrupted governments steal large amounts of money (last president Yanukovich is believed to snap sth like 80 bln $ out of country alone, and there were others), the same governments borrowed money from IMF under promices of much needed reforms, never did the reforms and the cycle continued until the Euromaidan. Unfortunately, it still continues. Ukraine is really dependant on international aid and some very unpopular reforms have been already implemented. For Ukraine there were 2 really bad ones (although i supported both) - raising retirement age and increasing price of natural gas for households. At the end these are not for austerity, but for battling huge inefficiency of Ukrainian economy, bringing more people into the workforce and (with gas) making the system more controllable and transparent.

&gt;The economic downfall will affect if it's payable and when it became a problem but not when it was taken.

Agreed. It does determine whether you can say the Greeks have been irresponsible though: they didn't do worse than Italy or Belgium, who had much higher debt-to-gdp ratios and did okay.

&gt;Hahahaha. From the same graph you could see that almost all other EU countries had surplus budgets and managed to reduce their debt during 95-07 or at least didn't start from 100% debt/gdp.

No, you can't. If anything you can see that it's a mixed bag of debts that rise, that fall, that fluctuate, all depending on the specific circumstances of those countries.

What you *can* see very clearly is that there's a big surge in debt in most countries after 2007, due to the banking crisis.

I thought so, but in this case it is quite misleading.

I is understandable that foreign agencies mentioned the chanting, in that it is universally associated with Islamists, which is also why putting it in the title is misleading.

To give context, this group has as much to do with Islam as an average racist group in Europe with Christianity.

In Germany writing something funny or smart might lead to a 0.5 second chuckle by the person who puts the ballot on the invalid stack.

Here are some interesting notes:

* Overall YES and NO camps are pretty much at the same level  YES 42,5% NO 43%

* Party voters seem to follow their party lines: ""YES"" has center left, center right and also a few of the far left and far right(27% Golden Dawn, 15% KKE).  ""No"" gets the far left and far right: Syriza,  KKE, Golden Dawn, ANEL

* Age: The younger the person the most likely they are to vote ""NO"". ""YES"" has an overall win only for the over 55 year olds. At least 15% of the people  between 25 and 54 are undecided.

* Studies: ""YES"" camp wins for primary and tertiary studies,  ""NO"" camp wins for ""secondary"" studies(this includes students) 

* Occupation: ""YES"" has a lead with pensioners, business owners  and self-employed. Everybody else goes for ""NO"". ""NO"" wins in all the following groups:

State employees: YES 31%, NO 58%

Private employees: YES 31%, NO 54%

Unemployed people: YES 26%, NO 51%.

* Leaving the EURO:  ""YES"" camp agrees the referendum is about leaving the EURO.  ""NO"" camp does not think the referendum is about leaving the EURO

* Peoples' own prediction: 56% think the results will be close, 33% think it will be a land slide. 50% think the ""YES"" camp will win, 39% think the ""NO"" camp will win. At least 10% of those voting ""NO"" think they will lose.

* Public Issue had asked a set of four indirect questions to gauge overall opinion about referendum. Their own estimation is that overall support for ""YES"" is 47,5% and ""NO"" is 42%

Yet still all those euros went Greece's way. Meanwhile massive tax evasion is casually maintained, as well as enormous state pensions. Yet still all those euros.

And now that it's getting serious to the point where the economy must suffer to be able to get healthy again, everybody revolts. Syriza offers nice talk, not solutions. Structuring debt is what you say, what I see is a country crashing because they do not agree to the terms for other loans (and more debt). You can restructure debt, but if you still acquire more while doing so it's pointless. 

Europe sees how their money may vanish and is getting scared the Greek government may let us down yet again. It all started because of their lies.

When it comes to the impact on the budget of a state they are very similar. I agree that they are different: war reparations can be considered a just repayment and compensation for crimes and damage inflicted on others. Bonds, not.

&gt;the economic circumstances were completely different. 

Why would that matter? If anything the boom times during the post-war rebuilding would actually make it possible to repay 4,5%, as opposed to the current near-zero growth climate.

&gt;Germany already succeeded with reforms, there wasn't a risk of any more defaults or continuing over-indebtedness involved.

So why do a debt cut at all then?

&gt;There weren't a common currency area or contractual commitments within the EU either.

Germany became a ECSC member in that year too. But why does that matter for the debt repayment conditions? The IMF doesn't have EU commitments either. If anything that would give their creditors *less* obligation to cut them some slack. But they did so anyway.

&gt;One could argue whether those reliefs were necessary or not (there were multiple motifs (Germany was given relief in exchange for things like funding of Allied military bases on their soil) at play here 

Greece has a role to play in the Russia conflict and the immigrant situation too. Fun fact: during the first five year of Trojka rule Greece did not delay or cancel the French frigates, or German submarines it ordered, an order worth many billions.

&gt;and I'm sure the biggest creditors got more out of it than they lost

Same goes now: their banks are safe already.

&gt;but you cannot draw conclusions on the Greek situation 60 years later.

I don't draw conclusions: I point out the inconsistency of drumming up moral outrage and imposing 4,5% of GDP repayments on a country for being a bit lax at taxation, while at the same time unchaining a world war and intentionally genociding a dozen million people is apparently small potatoes in comparison.

That's not right, and this comparison proves that the morality angle so many leaders have been harping on cannot warrant such harsh conditions on the repayment. And they were harping on the morality because there is no rational reason to impose conditions that are so harsh that the debt cannot be possibly repaid ever.",null,0,null,1436087098,null,0,false,0,cssp5z7,null,t3_3c1lfe,null,t1_cssp5z7,null,t1_css6rg8,null,null,null,1437598767,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Ergo by the standards of Greece's creditors their own demands are irrational. Debt is a political tool rather than anything economics, by the IMF's only calculation even with good growth Greece would never realistically pay back to debt. Meaning debt exists as a punishment for the political decisions of the Greek populace and a warning to other nations dare they defy the EU order (after all the western/northern European nations backed New Democracy at the elections in January, the very party they had blame for Greece's problems and the very party who had accumulated Greece's debt). Debt is a great tool to coerce the country into reforms benefitting international and national capitalists. The absence of debt is the absence of the power to force change, hence why creditors have done nearly everything to avoid removing it (it helps that many private creditors have already profited from the debt and what exists is merely interest etc.).

Vote theft. 

&gt;Do you guys have a system that distinguishes between ""invalid because stupid"" and ""invalid because opinion""?

That doesn't matter in either case, a vote is  a vote, even a nullified one.

&gt;In Germany writing something funny or smart might lead to a 0.5 second chuckle by the person who puts the ballot on the invalid stack. And at the end of the day these ""smart invalid"" votes are treated the same as ballots from people who are too stupid to vote correctly. Besides statisticians, nobody gives a fuck about these votes. Some people believe that invalid votes leads to lower percentage of the voted parties. But that's usually not the case, invalid votes are sorted out before percentages are calculated.


The difference between you and I is that I'm done choosing between the lesser evil *or* the less shitty politician. Untill there will be a political class that I might allign to a certain one, no party &amp; no politician will ever get my vote. The problem is that this trend just started. When [nullified] votes are counted and, by chance, they'll outnumber the votes casted to the parties/politicians, there's the first sign of problem. 


&gt;And what's up with the name? No secrecy of the ballot in Romania?

Whose name, what are you writing about? 

&gt;Btw, depending on the exact system that is used, invalid votes might count towards the required voter turnout. So voting invalid might be the opposite of what is desired.

And Greece GDP was inflated by the high government spending due to the insane amount ofdebt the government took. If you reduce the new government debt to a sane level as a result the GDP will take a hit and the debt ratio will increase. Also sure interest rates do not tell the whole story, but restructuring the debt so that the interest won't choke the greek economy was a necssary step on the way to recovery. 

I can agree that the lowering of the GDP was a result of the more strict austerity policy, but what was really the alternative? A greek default in 2010 would have been significantly more painful.

Also it is not the Job of the Troika to reform your tax system, that is the Job of the greek government and I agree that is a huge problem. Also the loans to greece were bound to government reforms that were failed to implement. Also would you prefer if greek had defaulted instead of the EZ keeping greece alive and inside the EZ? I mean it is basically due to the loans of the EZ. Also yes the greeks surely didn't stop working in 2010 (This whole hurr durr the greeks so lazy is just bullshit), but you had to cut back on government spending that was ridiculous before which in return reduced the GDP.

Also really if you think europe is in some weird anti-greek conspiracy and is just looking to maximise the profits of greece they would have abandoned you quite some time ago. The path to recovery just is harsh, but if you look at the 2014 data the GDP was starting to climb slowly again...

By now there is no good way for greece anymore because your government alienated the EZ so far that negotiations are barely possible. They hide far too much behind ideology instead of looking at reality in my oppinion.

Of course, there is  truth to that, no arguments here. But the Creditors are eyeing a much bigger issue; the response of the markets to any given outcome.

The 300B is peanuts and will have no impact on the creditors or their taxpayers (especially given the current terms of those loans). However, there is a risk of keeping Greece in the EZ and having to constantly deal with them should they never actually create the reforms necessary for a healthy economy. This risk is based on continuing instability within the EZ due to Greece, which could result in ongoing skepticism about the Euro, thereby keeping a leash on growth.

On the other hand, a Grexit is a complete unknown and calls in to question the entire treaty itself and paints a rather dubious picture of the continued stability of the EZ, given the weakness in Spain, Portugal and France. 

Both outcomes are risky. The terms of the proposals themselves aren't intended to be punishment. They are rational actions that the Greek government must take in order to finally get its house in order.

The problem is that the Creditor countries committed to their citizens that they would not take a hit financially. No debt restructuring. However, they have always known that debt restructuring was necessary. So they've boxed themselves in with their constituents and simply don't have the political will to do what is necessary for Greece to even have a remote chance of fixing itself.

Of course the Creditors don't operate in a vacuum. They rely on Greece to live up to its agreement and make the necessary reforms. The previous government did not do this. Instead of making structural reforms, they focused all their energy on tax hikes and spending costs. Sure, they hit the numbers, but the underlying fundamentals were unchanged. All because of self-interest and cronyism, of course.

Had the Greeks actually taken on the reforms, Creditors would have been in a much better position to get their parliaments to agree to debt restructure.

So no...it's not about punishment really. It's about very large carrots and very large sticks.

So many Greeks have failed to see this and the whole process has been further subverted by terrible political choices on both sides.

Greece playing the perpetual victim toward the Creditors and the Creditors fueling stereotypes about Lazy Greeks.

I have a bad news: nothing isn't acceptable, and with austerity nobody really care, if you can't pay the money back because of it.

This is very, very erroneous: your greek friends aren't paying taxes to the greek government (their version of the IRS); besides not consuming goods or using services with their VAT *in* their country. They are helping their consort/parents/family to pay for their taxes and consumption but *they*, your greek friends, aren't paying for themselves *in personna*. Instead they pay their taxes to your government (what country you said you were from?).

And, since I've already pointed out about the anti-protectionist and anti-favoritist policies in which the greek government cannot help greek individuals to start enterprises of any kind, it continues to be an economic black hole.

Edit:
Paul Krugman writes ""Finally, acceding to the troika’s ultimatum would represent the final abandonment of any pretense of Greek independence. Don’t be taken in by claims that troika officials are just technocrats explaining to the ignorant Greeks what must be done. These supposed technocrats are in fact fantasists who have disregarded everything we know about macroeconomics, and have been wrong every step of the way. This isn’t about analysis, it’s about power — the power of the creditors to pull the plug on the Greek economy, which persists as long as euro exit is considered unthinkable.""

It is intellectually dishonest for YOU to suggest otherwise. All you have addressed in the rest of your comment is how a gift of money will help Greece.

Different situation. They were willing to spend to ensure Germany doesn't fall to communism. They didn't give Germany money because it was the economically sensible thing to do. There is no political will now to gift large sums of money to Greece, especially as there are countries who are worse off and would quickly ask the same gifts of money to be paid to them - which the EU can't afford.

First of all, the is no ""private money of banksters"". Banks almost never invest their own private capital. Their capital is there to cover any kind of loss during a tough economic situation. Banks invest either their deposit money (i.e. if I put money on a savings account at 1% annual interest gained, the bank will reinvest that money at say 2.5%, pay me the 1% and keep the 1.5% as profit, while stepping in with their capital if things turn sour), or the money they can get on the money market (i.e. loan 100 MM EUR in a repo deal at say EONIA, invest it into bonds at an average of EONIA + spread; the spread is their profit and the loss is when some of those bonds default).

Secondly, you feel like it's unfair that Greece has been given a loan instead of free money. I don't really know how to respond to that. Why is it that nobody else in the world is prepared to step in and give Greece some free 60 bn EUR?

Thirdly, the high interest rate at which Greece borrowed after the Subprime crisis, and more importantly after the Lehman collapse, wasn't the result of a global crisis, but was the result of the Greek fiscal situation. As far as I remember, the peak interest rate Greek debt yielded was 37% for a 5 year bond. For comparison Finland paid only 0.4% at that time. How is that possible?

The answer is credit premium: something any rational investor would charge a debtor who is unlikely to return their debt. If I lend 100 EUR from you for five times, but give it back only once, whereas someone else here does the same, but always pays back the money, then you will be happier lending that guy the money than lending it to me. In the markets investors charge untrustworthy debtors more, in hopes of covering any loss they may incur from that debtor.

""Debt relief"" is this case is a politically correct term for ""outright default"". Ask yourself, how much will the global money market trust Greece after they do that?

- Wähler werden gefragt einen Vorschlag anzunehmen oder abzulehnen, der seit Tagen nicht mehr gültig ist

- Politiker behaupten sowohl, daß ein 'Nein' einen Grexit bedeutet, als auch ihn nicht bedeutet. Das Verlassen der Währungsunion ist aber laut EU-Recht ohnehin unmöglich, ein Verlassen der EU nur auf Verlangen des betreffenden Staates selber. Die Eurozone droht Griechenland also mit etwas, was sie gar nicht durchsetzen kann. Wie lange sie die ELA-Kapitalversorgung der griechischen Banken weiter verzögern kann ist eine andere Frage, denn ohne Bargeld und Auslandsüberweisungen droht sehr schnell eine humanitäre Katastrophe.

- Die griechische Regierung behauptet, ein 'Nein' würde ihre Verhandlungsmandat gegenüber 'den Institutionen' stärken. Allerdings hatte sie dieses Mandat einerseits schon seit den Wahlen im Dezember 2014. Andererseits wollte sie eigentlich überhaupt nicht mehr mit 
'der Troika' verhandeln, [wie bereits im Januar 2015 öffentlich in dramatischer Weise angekündigt](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/30/greece-politics-idUSA8N0UD01J20150130). Sie wollte auch keine weiteren Hilfspakete mehr, einschließlich der ELA-Bankenkapitalisierung, verlangte aber dann doch deren Verlängerung. Und reichte nach dem Abbruch der Verhandlungen einen Gegenvorschlag ein, der vielen Forderungen entsprach, die sie während er Verhandlungen abgelehnt hatte. Weswegen die auch nicht in dem Entwurf stehen, über den heute abgestimmt wird. Nichts an diesem Verhalten ergibt einen Sinn, es untergräbt nur die eigene Verhandlungsposition.

Strenggenommen also sollte es keinen Unterschied machen, ob eine Mehrheit der Griechen heute mit 'Ochi' oder 'Nai'  abstimmt, denn es geht bei dieser Abstimmung um nichts konkretes. 

Politisch gesehen könnte man das Referendum als aklamatorisches Urteil des Volkes über die Griechenland verordnete Austeritätspolitik  interpretieren. Das Problem dabei: die Menschen in den anderen Mitgliedsstaaten  der Eurozone stimmt nicht mit ab. 

Eine alternative Politik gegenüber Griechenland wurde nicht formuliert, debattiert, und zur Wahl gestellt. Die 'Troika' hat kein neues Mandat, um ihre Haltung zu ändern. Die 'demokratische Legitimation' eines 'Neins' beschränkt sich somit auf Griechenland, seine politische Konsequenz auf den Staatsbankrott.  Der wäre allerdings eine Katastrophe für alle Beteiligten.

Gewinnen die Vertreter des 'Ja', sind wir wieder mehr oder weniger genau da, wo wir vor knapp einer Woche waren, nur daß die Situation in Griechenland noch weitaus schlimmer geworden ist. Und die griechische Regierung zumindest umgebildet werden muss, wenn nicht neu gewählt.

It was an extremely hard choice and an act of cognitive dissonance, l suppose.
I made a political calculation based on the following factors:

1). I know how the economy has operated over the past many decades. The large public sector, the political class, the mass-media and the Oligarchs are simply 4 parts of the same body. They are deeply enmeshed. They hold the entire nation captive to a closed system that has allowed them to siphon the majority of the country's wealth. 

2). Varoufakis - Despite his Marxist pronouncements, I found his ideas to be very sound and well respected.

3). Tsipras - I didn't like him...but he had the advantage of being untainted by the corrupt system. He was an outsider and I felt he would have the political will to go after the corruption.

4). The other parties have been compromised for decades. The ND coalition during the 5 years of austerity gave further evidence that they had no interest in structural reforms. They opted to squeeze everything out of the middle and lower class with the aim of hitting the numbers. At the end of 2014 their stated aim was to re-enter the markets and exit the memorandum early. That was a clear indication that they had every intention of going back to the bad old days, and never implement the reforms, because those reforms would effectively tear down their corrupt system that has made them billions.

My calculation:

I knew that there would never be a government that could or would be able to go after all the factions of this mafia system. 

The right may go after the public sector but never reform the government to build truly professional technocratic organizations. It would always remain political and ""for sale"". And they would always protect the Oligarchs.

The left would never touch the public sector or make any labor reforms, but they might just go after the media-owning Oligarchs.

So, I chose Syriza hoping that they would negotiate in good faith, and commit to reforms (given Varoufakis stated position which was agreeable to reforms). I knew for certain that they would go after the Oligarchs. If they managed that, the public sector, while still bloated and inefficient would no longer have an accomplice with whom to pilfer. Perhaps eventually, a new government would go after the task of reforming them.

How did the shift happen?

The minute they started talking populist garbage directly to the creditors. It was a bit shocking and I honestly never imagined that they would take that approach in diplomatic discourse. They hired the Lazard group for fucks sake. And of course, when Varoufakis took the approach of lecturing is counterparts. They just got more and more reckless over time and it became apparent that they thought they could change the course of the entire EZ with their ideas. As if that's the way ideas spread...by lectures, during technical negotiations. That was it for me.

I shifted my hope to the Creditors (namely Germany), hoping they would rise above the chicken-shit game that Syriza was playing and leverage them to get the dirty work of breaking the Oligarchs backs once and for all. But, they too are in a political straight-jacket.

All in all...utter disaster.

I don't really feel guilty about my decision. It was the best I could do at the time. The alternative, I knew, was just a continuation of austerity plus corruption.

1/ The ECB will stop pumping money into the greek banks, and they will run out of money.  
2/ Greece will leave the Euro. This is pretty much unavoidable with a no vote, so bank accounts will be forcibly converted to Drachmas (the fear of this happening is why so much money has been taken out of the Greek banks in the last 6 months or so)  
3/ The new Drachma will devalue massively causing inflation and other problems, and essentially giving a massive pay cut to everyone.

For me the above seems impossible too avoid with a no vote. I doubt Greece would leave the EU, they would find a way to fudge that as it is not in anyones interests for that to happen.

A yes vote would be better for me, but what is really needed is a debt write-off. probably around 50% of the Greek national debt has to be written off. What also has to happen is reform of the Greek system to make sure this does not happen again, without that we are just giving a lot of free money to Greece.

* A YES means *a lot* of suffering, new austerity measures, there is great possibility that we will be in the same situation or even worse for many years to come *but* we will have more help from Europe and we *might* be able to progress slowly until we propose another deal. It will show the Europeans that the Greeks want to be a member of the EZ, but it will also be a sign of desperation and will allow our creditors to force us to accept 
any measures they want.

* A NO might mean a lot of things. What the government says is that it will show our creditors that we are not afraid of them and it will be the basis of a stronger negotiation from Greece, which I doubt will be very fruitful. There is also a high possibility however that the creditors will take it as a sign that Greece doesn't want to come to an agreement with the creditors and we will practically be forced to leave EZ. That would be devastating, because Greece imports almost every product it consumes, and it has neither the means not the ability to produce any of them right now. With a currency which has practically no value everything will be extremely expensive, espesially medication, but *if* somehow we overcome this obstacle and start producing we *might* be able to recover sooner and in a better shape than with austerity measures.

My advice, have a reasonable backup. I've seen too many people end up working at grocery stores regardless of their talent. Also, to a part, this industry hires based on prior experience in other companies, someone fresh out of school, regardless of better talent, will not be hired vs someone with 4+ years of stable work experience. Game development is way more than just talent.

Da finde ich es durchaus angemessen das Volk zu fragen, ob sie denn noch mehr von dieser Medizin haben wollen, oder ob nicht lieber mal alternative Lösungen mit einem nachhaltigem Effekt angegangen werden sollen.

Die Griechen wollen überwiegend den Euro behalten. Jetzt das Referendum von Seitens der EU zum Austritt aus dem Euro (rechtlich gar nicht vorgesehen) umzudeuten halte ich für unlauter.

&gt;

&gt;The __Communications Decency Act of 1996__ (__CDA__), also known by some legislators as the ""Great Cyberporn Panic of 1995"", was the first notable attempt by the [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress) to regulate [pornographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography) material on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). In 1997, in the landmark [cyberlaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberlaw) case of *[Reno v. ACLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_v._ACLU)*, the [United States Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court) struck the anti-indecency provisions of the Act.

&gt;The [Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Congress) was Title V of the [Telecommunications Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996). It was introduced to the [Senate Committee of Commerce, Science, and Transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science_and_Transportation) by Senators [James Exon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._James_Exon) (D-NE) and [Slade Gorton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slade_Gorton) (R-WA) in 1995. The amendment that became the CDA was added to the Telecommunications Act in the Senate by an 84–16 vote on June 14, 1995.

&gt;As eventually passed by Congress, Title V affected the Internet (and online communications) in two significant ways. First, it attempted to regulate both [indecency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indecency) (when available to children) and [obscenity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity) in [cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace). Second, Section 230 of the Act has been interpreted to say that operators of Internet services are not to be construed as publishers (and thus not legally liable for the words of third parties who use their services).

&gt;

&gt;


&gt;* In [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), the region of [Molise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molise) has the same role as Bielefeld. Since Molise has been the ground for several political men, such as former magistrate [Antonio Di Pietro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Di_Pietro), it is implied that they might be involved in the conspiracy. 

&gt;* On USENET, a similar joke was told about [North Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota) in the 1980s.  Variations on this have spread throughout the Internet, often focusing on other rural states, such as [Nebraska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska), [Idaho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho) and [Wyoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming).

&gt;* Several modern Internet communities enjoy pretending [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium) does not exist. These beliefs stem from a 1995 posting to a Cascadian BBS by Lyle Zapato. 

&gt;* The town of [Teruel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teruel) in Spain is the capital of [the province of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Teruel), but its low population and mountainous location makes it relatively obscure within Spain. A campaign group with the slogan [*Teruel existe*](https://en.wikipedia.org//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teruel_existe) (""Teruel exists"") was founded in 1999 to press for greater recognition and investment in the town and the province (the campaign was successful, but Teruel remains the only provincial capital in Spain without a direct railway link to the capital, Madrid). This, however, only served to spur joking comments stating *Teruel no existe*, i.e. ""Teruel does not exist"".

&gt;* In [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey), a similar belief about [Bilecik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilecik) is popular among Internet users, popularized by users of [Ekşi Sözlük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ek%C5%9Fi_S%C3%B6zl%C3%BCk). 

&gt;* In Sweden, a [mockumentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary) claimed that [the 1958 FIFA World Cup did not actually take place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_58).

&gt;* The Danish satirical news program ""De Uaktuelle Nyheder"" did a story on cheating in the [Tour de France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_de_France) which first claimed that the race was filmed in the same studio (at [Area 51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_51)) as the [Moon landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories) and then escalated to denying the existence of [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France). Presented as evidence were old maps of Europe without France and prominent people stating that French is actually gibberish. It was even argued that all Frenchmen are in fact actors, and that map manufacturers are behind the whole thing. The first question of the Bielefeld conspiracy was also used. 

&gt;* The federal state of Acre is the Bielefeld equivalent in [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil).  

&gt;* In England, it is said when referring to the train station on the line between Alton and Guildford, that ""no-one gets on and no one gets off at North Warnborough"", a small village in the Surrey Hills near [Guildford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guildford).

But the reason I think I would vote no is because I see no evidence that they are going to change the deal enough to actually help Greece, If continued austerity is the only thing being offered they will eventually leave the Euro, the people will only take so much before the tipping point is reached. If that is the case the only option is to take the worse short term solution and hope that it works out long term, because that is where they will be eventually, they are better off doing it now.

It is obviously far from ideal, ideally everyone would acknowledge the fact that they bankrupt, and work together to come up with a realistic long term solution, but for whatever reason that isn't looking likely. I hope that Europe will accept the democratic will of the people of Greece regardless, and if they do vote no, do all they can to assist Greece in whatever path they go down. Voting No doesn't have to mean leaving the EU, voting no doesn't even have to mean leaving the Euro, but as an outsider by biggest concern is the reaction being one to protect the Euro and not help Greece in its transition.

Any continuation with a structural adjustment program that does not include some form of debt restructuring is bound for failure. Primary surplus obligations that are completely unrealistic given the Greek negative balance of payments, vast amounts of spending reduction in a recessionary period and most notably, a debt to GDP ratio that is driving away foreign investment are all problems that must be addressed. Yet, the creditors seem to be fixated on failed macro-economic policy, [despite the academic consensus regarding austerity.](http://mainlymacro.blogspot.ie/2015/06/the-academic-consensus-on-impact-of.html)

The fact of the matter is, Greece can either continue with this policy, or deal with the disastrous short run effects of an inflationary Greek economy. Like I said, in the short run, it will be difficult but in the long run, it will be preferable to that of the proposal offered by the creditors.

lol. How edgy of you. Unlike most other countries hit by the Great Recession, this wasn't something caused by the banks gleefully lending to whomever. This was caused by decades of the Greek State loaning from its own banks. Furthermore, the banks aren't a sovereign nation capable of forcing their own demands, they have to appeal to their states to do so. They are a creditor to the Greek debt apparatus just like all the other creditors, with the difference that if Greece defaults they wont be able to do anything about it unlike other countries (since they'll be insolvent and nationalized). And af for the expense of the Greek people? That's how the world works: the government takes out loans to improve infrastructure, incentivize economy etc. (in Greece's case to cover up the hole in the deficit due to their extremely bloated bureaucracy-pensions-taxevation problem) and then will pay the loans back with either taxes or tariffs, surprise!, coming from the Greek people, who enjoyed the benefits of the loans in some way (like not being hounded by tax collectors for not paying taxes etc.).

You're an idiot if you think letting the banks fail is the sensible option, since you're essentially advocating for the state to lose any credit it could possibly ever muster not to mention advocating for most people to lose their life savings (since lol who is going to guarantee their accounts if the regulator, the Greek state, is out of money?).

Restricting ELA access to the Greek banks was a political decision by the ECB governing council. The Greek banks have very little dependency on the financial health of the greek state, i.e., they hold very little government debt. See what Danièle Nouy, Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism said in an interview just three weeks ago:

&gt;    The Greek banks have been on a drip-feed from the central bank for months. But the central bank may only give emergency loans when the institutions are solvent. Who at the ECB decides whether that is still the case – you as supervisor or the ECB Governing Council around President Mario Draghi?

&gt;  Monetary policy and supervision work in strict separation. We have different staff and are located in different buildings. We share access to data and work closely together in the field of financial stability. Otherwise, we only inform each other about facts of cases for which it is absolutely necessary. When it comes to monetary policy decisions such as emergency loans, it is therefore up to the ECB Governing Council to decide on which banks it classifies as solvent. We carry out our own examination independently.

&gt;  That sounds extraordinary. What would you do if one ECB board still classified the Greek banks as solvent and the other one didn’t?

&gt;    That is a hypothetical question that I will not answer. I simply do my supervisory job and send the results to the ECB Governing Council.

This is an honest appeal for a ""Yes"" vote.

I have recently visited Istanbul for my second time. My first time there was 8 years ago, in 2007, the year Romania joined the EU. Back then Istanbul seemed to me substantially more developed than Bucharest. Now, however, it seemed to me nothing much has changed for the better in Istanbul while Bucharest has evolved clearly towards civilization.

I think being in the EU and participating in further integration (adopting the euro, etc) guarantees you a continuous evolution towards a more civilized, less corrupt and more prosperous society. Sometimes this happens very slowly but it still happens, whether you like to admit it or not.

I know certain aspects of the EU are sometimes frustrating but the alternatives are always worse. Romania has also been thru austerity imposed by the troika, probably more brutal than what Greece had to implement. Romania has also been thru hyperinflation in the 90's and I can tell you, economically, there are no worse things. In fact not just economically - such a climate breeds corruption of simply incredible levels and it can cause everlasting damage to certain parts of the economy and culture.

You are being lied by your politicians. For a European country with poor industry and lacking a functional economy there is no alternative to the EU and the EZ. If you jeopardize your EZ and EU membership you will be worse off. You are not Switzerland, the UK or Norway. What you need is not the drachma and getting friendly with Russia. What you need is to get your house in order, eradicate corruption and tackle tax evasion. You can do this in the EZ but you will never do it outside it because there will be no outside supervision.

Voters usually shape reality to their already existing believes. It rarely happens that say a left voter hears some argument from the right and therefore changes his opinion (and vice versa). That's more of a long term thing. The campaigns for Yes or No wont really affect already existing believes. Of course, some voters are generally uninformed and stupid, but then again, who has perfect knowledge and judgement anyway? Democracy isn't perfect.

I totally agree, that this referendum is a really bad idea, offers a bad choice to make and generally shifts the blame from elected politicians to the people, who voted those politicians into office to make those kind of decisions with more inside knowledge than the typical voter.

I suggest you go vote. Maybe the vote won't matter in the long term, maybe you'll learn that you voted the wrong or the right way.

Of course there will be efforts to keep Greece in the Euro even with a No-vote. The problem is no-one knows how to achieve that and how long it would take - not even Donald Tusk.

And I don't know why people focus solely on that quote as he said quite few things such as: 
&gt; No matter how Greeks vote Sunday, the EU is looking for ways “to keep them inside” the single currency, though that may require “a completely new” approach to allow the eurozone to coexist with a bankrupt country, Donald Tusk told POLITICO.   
...  
&gt; Tusk said that “it’s very clear that the referendum is not … about being in the eurozone or not. No, in fact, nobody’s interested — **I hope** nobody’s interested — in this kind of choice.”   
...  
&gt; “In time of crisis, and it’s not about Greece only but all crises, the biggest problem is lack of confidence and trust,” he added. **“The first goal is to rebuild trust in Greece.”**  
&gt;
Tusk said the EU will work with Athens regardless of Sunday’s outcome, though **“if the Greeks vote Yes, I think it’s a chance to open a new chapter in negotiations, perhaps more promising than before.”**  
&gt;
In that case, the EU would have to first see if Tsipras stays on, a new leader takes over or fresh elections are called.  
&gt;
**In case of a No, according to Tusk, “the space for negotiation will be smaller, obviously.** But I would like to warn, for sure we don’t need any dramatic messages after No voting.” The EU, he said, would have to wait to hear “the new proposal of the Greek government.”    
...  
&gt; **“Maybe we will have to get used to living with a country as a member of the eurozone in bankruptcy.”** He added: “Maybe we have to prepare the whole organization — the eurozone and EU — to live with countries with such a problem as Greece today.”    
...  
&gt;**A possible solution is to put Greece in a euro “waiting room,”** not formally out of the single currency but in a limbo until it can negotiate its way back in one day.

If I were Greek that would be pretty hairrising stuff to hear.

&gt; Greece can stay in Euro even with ‘no’ vote, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble tells lawmakers

The majority of the population were, but we grew rich on trade, mining and manufacturing\*. 

**Hansa**

Prior to the Kalmar Union the Hanse were important for our exports for a long while. Bergen was basically a German city, Oslo and Tønsberg were other stops on the Nord-*wegen* route ;)

**Denmark-Norway**

During the Union Norway was an exclusive market for Danish grain by law. While Norway exported fish, minerals and products not manufactured in Denmark such as glassware (see also Cobalt mines for [blue glass](http://blaa.aipublish.no/ai_files/5480_256_8264_nye_molla_051_406344.jpg)).

The mining industry was setup using imported German experts and laws (*Berggesetze*). Silver and other minerals were exported to major markets in Europe.

Forestry and lumber exports was a huge business for many centuries. England was our main market (plank for ship building). In the 20th century the Norwegian paper products industry was huge.

**Industrialization**

For industrialization our [hydro-electric capacity](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/norway-wants-to-offer-hydroelectric-resources-to-europe-a-835037.html) was essential. A legacy that has left us 99% hydro powered for more than a century. Weaving mills and other factories blossomed during the 19th century.

This cheap energy source enabled us to establish heavy, power-hungry industries such as metal refineries. Today we export aluminium and car parts to all the major brands in the world (see  Hydro, Elkem, Kongsberg Auto). 

One of our major industrial concerns, Norsk Hydro, was built using technology from both the US, Norway and Germany; and in cooperation with I.G. Farben. Hydro has since split and is part of Statoil (energy) and Yara Int'l (agri-biz).

**Fisheries**

Our fish has always been traded far and near; dried, salted or canned. [Canning](http://www.museumstavanger.no/museums/the-norwegian-canning-museum/) was an important industry in the 19th century. Today, the Portuguese and Brazilians couldn't make their Bacalao without our stock fish (dried cod). The Japanese only began to eat Salmon sushi because of our marketing efforts, hehe.

Norway was part of Denmark-Norway. [We fought many wars](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_wars_involving_Norway) with Sweden and other continental powers.

They can't! That is the problem and why this referendum is a joke. The creditors can't just bring back the proposal because it was part of the ESFS - which Greece has left. For anything that happens now the EU will have to negotiate something completely new and go through the national parliaments - where Syriza will probably be told to fuck off, especially after that referendum stunt.

null,false,RubiksCoffeeCup,null,null,null,"&gt;Greece's problem was not that their economy wasn't big enough, it was that it was mismanaged, corrupt and laden with largesse.  You can't fix that problem by growing the economy anymore than you can fix being poor with credit cards.  The austerity measures attempted to fix the root problems that were causing Greece's issues.  Growing the economy wasn't part of it - nor is that the EU's job.  It's Greece's job.

A country isn't a person, and the state is not the economy (unless fascism, which we may see yet rise in Greece). The Greek economy was in a deep recession, which reduced state income and made the debt,  back then 107 percent GDP, unsustainable.  The debt itself wasn't that high, there are other states that didn't fail with similar debt. The austerity measures imposed so that that Greece would get money to bail out private lenders,  many of them German,  French, ...  banks habe further depressed the economy,  making it even more impossible for Greece to sustain the debt,  because raising taxes and such in an economy that is falling apart won't help matters. This was known in 2009. It is macroeconomically clear that austerity has a depressing effect.  This was accepted because it's a way of keeping banking crisis confined to the periphery. The result of all that is that private debt is socialised, the economy further broken, and people pushed into destitution,  for the sake of private interests of the already wealthy and of wealthy states who can artificially keep their banking crisis at bay and use poorer countries to keep their exports competitive while still keeping the euro too strong for poorer economies. 

The US decided to do the opposite of austerity and look where they stand economically. Austerity is a mistake that is ideologically driven. 

And to look at the humanitarian distaster looming in Greece and tell them that it is just punishment for being compliant with austerity measures,  as some have done,  or for boring wrong (left) as others have done, or just because,  is cynical and wrong.

In reality Syriza is the first Greek government to make it's negotiations open and public at every stage. Secondly I don't think the content of this referendum has suddenly crept upon Greece. It's people have know the negotiating for the last 6 months and the deals on offer. And if you can't learn arguments in 1 week months won't make the difference. Most people saying *'the people of not informed'* wouldn't include themselves in that category and are quite willing to make all kinds of projection upon the results of either outcome.

&gt;The perversion of democracy in this instance is utterly grotesque

only the amoral can live with such moralising. Greeks have had 5+ years of imposed austerity done in secret and objectively anti-democratic (insofar as New Democracy was elected against the troika's proposals only to be forced to submit to them after their victory), and yet the troika and it's lackeys in the press can - in an instance - suddenly become the great defenders of democracy. What's really grotesque is those who don't want a referendum at all calling it anti-democratic because it's not perfect. If the Greek government had made the decision itself unilaterally that would be, by definition, anti-democratic insofar as they stood on a platform against both austerty and leaving the Euro. It may be rushed but this is a crisis, and it's not made easier by the troika preventing Greece from giving more time to the referendum, but at least the whole Greek population can collectively decide it's future.

All this talk of the referendum not meeting 'international standards' is purely setting the stage so European power can condemn the result if it's a no.

You cannot move on from that observation by making such a deterministic claim about growing up and violence, though. That was not my experience growing up and going to school with prepubescent and early teen Bosnians and Serbs whose parents came here to Denmark as refugees during the Bosnian War.

Indeed, [a 2011 study of criminality among refugees in Denmark](http://flygtning.dk/dk/nyheder-og-presse/nyhed/artikel/flygtninge-ikke-mere-kriminelle-end-danskere/) found that refugees are no more criminal than Danes and that they break the law even less than immigrants who came here for family reunification.

Under the ECB’s rules, ELA can only be provided to banks that are seen as solvent. Greek banks can hardly be considered solvent right now.

“It is very difficult to see how one could conclude that banks that are basically closed because they have no access to cash, operating under a government that has just defaulted to the IMF, could possibly be solvent,” said Gary Jenkins, chief credit strategist at London-based LNG Capital, in a note.

2. Even in the worst kind of depression, there will be minor upticks. The one in Greece was much too brief to read much into it.

3. If it is not the job of the Troika to reform the tax system, it is not their job to reform pensions and government spending. They are all at the same level of internal economics. I think they interfered terribly, but I am not sure they had any choice on that. At the same time, what they interfered with can be seen now as clearly the wrong thing. The government cuts make up a very small part of the GDP difference. It is almost all a crumbled and devastated economy as a whole. As I said, they were warned and did not choose to do things slower and in the right way. The path to the end game is not a straight line, and they tried to bulldoze one in.

4. The bailout was only minimally for Greece, and mainly for German and French banks. It seems like for the last year there has been no effort to actually do anything for Greece, and that was what I was referring to. At this point it looks like other EU members are thinking only of how to recover as much cash as possible. This seems obvious given that they are going against all economic principles, continue to reject outcry from many economists, and the judgment of the IMF and the US.

5. Agreed, the current Greek government is very bad at Chess, and this lack of capacity to negotiate without revealing their tactics has destroyed their chances.

6. I have no idea what they can do, but it is pretty clear that nobody does now. Certainly the dichotomy of austerity or exit is so small-minded that they are guaranteed defeat. But the lines have been drawn in the sand.

Nobody asks for that. 

&gt;Even if elected officials would still want to go ahead with this, they can't because the majority of their voters are opposed to financing the habits of other countries.

To an extent the poorer countries are already financing the habits of the richer ones.

I'm getting so sick of this faulty ""all went to the banks"" argument. Yes, of course a huge chunk of the money went to the creditors and it's because Greece used the debt to live above its means for years.
Besides, while a huge chunk of the bailout went straight to the banks, it allowed Greece to keep part of its welfare state (albeit hugely slimmed down )- which would be unsupportable by itself. So yes, de facto the money did go to the Greeks.
While the economic situation is a living hell, it would be way worse if Europe didn't support them.

Anyway, your country IS doomed. Your economy and part of your culture are structural failures. No matter how much money will be pumped (wasted) into it, it doesn't change the fact that corruption and fraud are rampant and tax evasion is endemic in every part of your society. On top of that your economy isn't innovative or competitive and your production levels are among the lowest in Europe. And even with this crisis 75% of public employees want early retirement. Your economy simply has no virtue.

Yes. It is save. The problem with torrenting is that it is p2p. That means two things: One, whoever uses the torrent, also gets your IP, which is why it is so easy to identify you. Two, there is a German court ruling that defines torrenting as participation in illegal distribution of copyrighted material, hence the high fee. They basically force you to buy a distribution license from the rights holder.

Since neither is the case with streaming, so you are fine. All these horror stories you have heard are the result of one law firm who exploits the fear people have of law suits to threaten them into signing a cease and desists and pay a hefty fine.

Unfortunately, no. I know plenty of people (you can find many in this sub, I think) that moved abroad because the pay was much better.

There isn't a Western government in the world that would have made a better offer. We don't live in dictatorships run by economists but in democracies where the people elect a government. Public opinion has to support big decisions, otherwise you steer right into a political crisis.

Greece only became part of the Eurozone because former governments cooked their books with the help of Goldman Sachs, then experienced rapid GDP and wage growth caused by cheap credit and sadly voted for a party that tends to put the emphasis on blaming the rest of Europe.

Syriza-affiliated newspaper Avgi ran a cartoon that depicted the German finance minister as a Nazi who wants to make soap and fertiliser out of the ashes of Greek people. Tsipras called it 'unlucky'. It was stories like these that destroyed positive public opinion towards Greece.

We have heard the horror stories from Greek people who lived there and were repatriated after the Soviet collapse. Anyone who wishes such fate to other people generates revulsion to me.




&gt;I think OP meant to say ""Romania had it so much worse, so stop complaining Greece"", which I personally disagree with, but I know a lot of people don't - just because someone has/had it worse doesn't make other tragedies any less... tragic.




While true that people really did go through harder times then, especially combined with the police state and lack of basic freedom, I find people rejoicing in other people's misery reprehensible regardless of their own past experiences. 




The most horrible thing to have happened in living memory is WW2, so from there I will take an example: How humane (or, clearly not) would have been for the people who were victimised by the Nazis, to exalt in the misery of the German people immediately post-war?

- diceva di aver partecipato al cammino di Santiago, invece rimase in paese nel periodo in cui diceva di essere stato via.

Altra azienda, altro ex collega:

- diceva di essere un campione di bowling e invece quando facemmo una partita aziendale fece persino meno punti di me, che giocavo per la prima volta;

- diceva di essere stato campione regionale di go-kart, ma quando andarono in pista un altro collega lo doppiò più e più volte;

- diceva di sapere l'ebraico e anche lì alla prova dei fatti fallì clamorosamente (""eh non mi ricordo più niente, è passato tanto tempo"").

Un conoscente:

- dice di essere fotografo accreditato Vogue, solo perché si è creato un profilo [qui](http://www.vogue.it/en/photovogue) dove possono farlo dogs &amp; pigs;

- dice di lavorare per facebook;

- varie ed eventuali, che ogni tanto mi riferiscono (non parlo da anni con costui, come coi precedenti).

It was an historical mistake as this event allowed the ranks behind him to survive, remain unknown and close to power to this day, a position from which they undermined my country's progress towards a functional democracy for their own benefit (their grip is slipping but very slowly).

Here is some of what happened in those 8 years:

* Food was rationed. Food required for a minimally normal diet was permanently missing from stores. People had to endure long hours queued outside stores to even get a chance of getting their ratio of anything. For your children to not fall ill from malnutrition you had to develop a personal network of acquaintances that could help you procure food from small farmers or store workers / managers, through bribes.
* Central heating in large towns was just enough to not have ice developed on the inside of your windows. In most towns there was no central heating and you had to rely on improvised heating solutions (most of which relied on gas, which was also rationed).
* Electricity was rationed. There was no electricity during the night or during most of the day.
* Saturday was a slightly shorter work day but still a work day.
* Healthcare was disastrous. Only very generic drugs were available and if you developed any special problem you were as good as dead as there were not nearly enough medical supplies for surgeries and whatever there was, was accessible only through large bribes or connections to someone from the Party.
* Party propaganda about the glorious path Romania is walking on was omnipresent. All media was continuously pumping fake news about huge production efficiency in all areas of agriculture and industry. The assault on your mind was debilitating due to the omnipresence of these messages in all media and everything you did all day long, in contrast with the reality that you could see around you.
* Terror was omnipresent, including within families, through the political police (Securitatea). 500.000 collaborators (from a population of ~22.000.000) were feeding them with info about any person they saw doing or saying anything against the Party, in exchange for favors like a little more food. If you became a target for Securitate, it was like torture because the Party and the political police were above the law. They could get you fired and you would not be hired anywhere else or they could make you disappear in some prison via arranged trials.

Had Greece and other periphery nations allowed their banks to fail, there would have been a German banking crisis too as a result of atrocious German banking regulations. This entire debate is framed as a 'Greek problem' when in reality it was just as much a German problem. 

The difference is, the Germans were much smarter on a political level, ensuring that the Greeks socialised the debt at a national level while they shored up their banking system by divesting themselves of bad periphery loans when they got the chance in 2011/2012 - thus passing the burden of securing the European financial system down to the average Greek.

To address the other part of your question, they're harmed by bailing out the banks as the so-called 'moral' principle behind debt is that the creditor takes a risk in loaning money, and as a result is entitled to interest repayments as a result of both the risk and the opportunity cost of lending. When you make a series of bad loans, it's not up to the taxpayer to reimburse you for your crap decisions by slashing pensions and destroying the national economy with punitive economic policies.

&gt;Europe's dirty little secret, though, is that more time will eventually become all the time in the world.

--
This is a misconception. A devaluated greek currency won't buy it any significant amount of competitiveness within the international markets as the country does not have much of an export economy, and even the products that it does export depend on imported components. 

Yes, one unit of Greek labour would become cheaper when expressed in foreign currency, but Greece's labourers would likely not cope well with the resulting decrease in purchasing power (exacerbated by inflation), which may very well result in unions demand wage increases. (thus negating any potential competitive edge)

One area in which Greece may stand to win from a devaluated currency I suppose is in tourism. A cheaper drachma would likely attract more tourists, though only provided the country itself remains stable enough to be seen as an attractive holiday destination. 

All in all, devaluation may provide some short term relief for Greece but wouldn't end up changing the fact that the country needs to implement some serious and painful reforms, tackle corruption and pay off a WHOLE lot of debt, meaning that its economy will stay crippled for many years if not decades to come.

The total outstanding private debt of the government is about €34bn, and about €13bn is held by the greek, banks. Not zero, but not so important.

What is more important is the collateral the banks are currently using to borrow from the ECB is some sort of weird instrument created by the Greek government. Will have to look up the details a bit more.

****
Collateral is another matter. The ELA is secured by a hodgepodge of collateral: some of the banks’ loans, some covered bonds, a little bit of government debt. For the four big banks, though, a special kind of government-guaranteed bond makes up a large chunk of the collateral.

That means to keep ELA going, the ECB must primarily assess whether the government’s guarantee is solid enough to make the collateral adequate. It’s a judgment call.

null,false,redvolunteer,IREL,Ireland,null,"Yes, I am arguing for a default. That's been the very basis of my argument - had Greece defaulted in '08, **your** shitty banking system would have collapsed and **your** country would be in a similar position to Greece.

Now that your banks have divested themselves of much of the bad periphery debt, your country is no longer as exposed to a Greek default as it was. This has never been a Greek problem, it has always been a *European problem*. Your government has cynically played a game wherein the socialisation of debts that protected the *entire* EZ financial sector, and thus the Euro, has been passed down to the average Greek. This is something that you, and the majority of others in this thread seem incapable of comprending, lest it undermine your simplistic notion of ungrateful Greeks with their hands out chanting 'gib money pls Deutschland - moar pensions'.

&gt;The bailout programs were the recapitalization. That's the point. You can't have one without the other.

I can't tell if you're just being obstinate in an attempt to save face. I realise that English probably isn't your first language, so please go back and read what I wrote again. When you've done that, then look at what you just wrote with a critical eye. Of course the bailout programs were concerned with the recapitalisation of the banking system, that's *explicitly* what I've been saying. Please don't respond until you're capable of comprehending the point that was initially made - a point that *nobody else* in this thread has had a problem comprehending.

&gt;That would have been freely available while the banking sector was on fire and the economy everywhere would have suffered, and that no country would have invested into itself to represent the interests of its own people (that would have been under severe pressure due to the previously mentioned further escalated economic crisis) while Greeks, Spanish, Portuguese etc. were starving on their respective streets.

Well at least we agree on one thing, that the EU is so poorly structured that rather than enabling time for EU governments to deliberate over the best course of action (as one would expect in a 'democratic' Union), the Greeks, Irish Spanish etc. were forced into making snap decisions under the coercive threat of having their populations starving on the streets. 

&gt;The part where you're burning down the economy for something that already exists and does not stop investment banks from existing and causing trouble.

No, the point is that the moral argument for debt rests on the fact that the creditor takes a risk by lending money and suffers an opportunity cost, as a result of which they are entitled to charge interest for use of their capital. The point is not that one can make shit loans, profit from them when everything is fine and then have the taxpayer step in to fund your terrible lending practices when everything falls apart. The point is that functioning banks *didn't exist*. A functioning bank should have been created and the others should have been left to fail. Of course, that would have affected the German banking system - so we couldn't have that.

&gt;No, here I assume that you're trying to innovate and actually attempt to solve long standing issues instead of basically going back to he way it was before but doing more damage to the European economy and citizens in the process because ""muh banks"".

This paragraph makes no sense in the context of the discussion. Please rephrase what you're trying to say if you want me to address it.

&gt;No, but the only way to make the system

No, you quite literally equate the existence of a state bank with communism. You clearly had, and have no intention of conducting this exchange in good faith by shamelessly denying this fact - this is just an egotistical pissing match for you.

Further, you ignore everything I say about the rather moderate proposal of the State stepping in to finance industrial development where the private sector has *so abysmally failed* and decide to pretend that having a singular state bank is an undesirable thing - as if the current situation was somehow a more desirable option.

Certes, je pourrais te dire la même chose sur les français, d'ailleurs j'ai parfois mentionné r/france à des amis parce que je ne connais pas ni ne rencontre de gens qui ont de telles opinions sur certains sujets.

Je vois mal des gens du front de gauche défendre certaines choses qui seraient équivalentes.

Navré, je ne vois pas où tu trouves une condescendance à dire que mon pays a un problème avec les armes et que le bord des gens qui défendent la chose a souvent un niveau d'éducation inférieure. Ca te choque que je mentionne qu'il y ait des gens plus éduqué et avec des opinions politiques un chouïa plus informées ?

Comme je voyage, je parle plusieurs langues, j'ai vécu dans différents pays, j'ai grandi dans des écoles pour les gamins internationaux, et de part un de mes métiers, je parle souvent à des gens de tous les horizons.

null,false,the_straylight_run,null,null,null,"&gt; It was Tsipras who scheduled a referendum after the final deadline.

This part is strictly true. I'm not arguing against it. But your conclusions about it are still wrong.

For example, you say:

&gt;  The Eurozone has made its final offer

Which, according to Tsiparas, and the Greek side, that offer was extended on 26 June, with a 48 hour deadline. Up until then they were at the negotiating table trying to get a deal. Consider how many different offers the Greek side made, and how many times they gave concessions in those offers to bring them closer to the Creditors side. It wasn't up until the last minute that Creditors even started to give any concessions themselves.

[Here](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/business/dealbook/hopeful-start-to-greek-debt-negotiations-quickly-soured.html?_r=1) is an article from NY Times reporting on the process, the exchange between the Greeks and the Creditors, that prompted the referendum. 

See this:

&gt; This is going nowhere, the 40-year-old Greek leader said in frustration, according to people who were in the room with him. The more we move toward them, the more they are moving away from us, Mr. Tsipras said.

&gt; an accumulation of slights, insults and missed opportunities between Greece and its creditors that led the prime minister to conclude that a deal was not possible, regardless of any concessions he might make.

&gt; That Monday, June 22, Greece’s technical team in Brussels submitted an eight-page proposal to their counterparts. The paper was an effort to bridge a six-month divide on how Greece planned to sort out its future finances.

&gt; Greece’s creditors — the I.M.F., the other eurozone nations and the European Central Bank — sent the Greek paper back and marked it in red where there were disagreements.

So there you have a Greek proposal that goes 90% of the way to the Creditors position, only varying slightly to factor in the few things that Tsiparas knew he couldn't get through Greek Parliament.

Tsiparas is then sent back to the old hardline 'take it or leave it' creditor position, and a 48 hour ultimatum. So he calls a referendum. He can't sign the document to agree to all the Creditor demands, he's gone past the mandate he was given. 

Then the Creditors deny that any of it actually happened, and behave as if Greece just decided to quit 'out of the blue' and that they hadn't given him 48 hours to accept their offer or it would expire. 

So your claim about it being a 'delaying tactic' is simply a denial that events that happened actually happened, and uses the Creditor revision of negotiation history instead.

&gt; the government cannot accept such an offer if there is a ""no"" vote.

Here's another item in the Great Confusion that has covered everything. 

What offer? What does this referendum have to do with an offer? There are only two scenarios:

Either:

A) There is an offer by Greece's Creditors, that it can either accept or reject, and thus the Referendum refers to it, and the Europeans who said 'Greece is voting on the Euro' are lying to Greeks to get them to vote Yes. That way Tsiparas has to concede to all Creditor demands by his new mandate. 

If the above scenario is true, the creditors are interfering in a national Greek referendum to get a result for negotiations that is a win for them.

B) There is no longer any package on offer, as the Bailout programme has expired, and thus that there are no further negotiations be done regarding it. In this scenario, new negotiations can only start when the ESM request is approved by the ESM BoG. That hasn't happened yet. 

In this scenario, Greek voters are voting on a deprecated bailout package, and the results are irrelevant no matter what the outcome of the vote is. The whole 'Greeks are voting on the Euro' is a completely useless tactic, and begs the question why Europe would care, let alone get involved in, the Ref in the first place. Or why they would be alarmed that Tsiparas called one to be concluded after the deadline passed.

I mean you might argue that the referendum might have symbolic value to the future negotiations on the new package Greece submitted in the 3rd bailout ESM request, and that it might influence the BoG to reject the same. Or you might argue that the position taken by the Greeks might influence how the negotiations are conducted, if they are ever authorised in the event the request is approved.

But neither one of those requires any interference by European actors in the Ref. The Europeans here are behaving in fact bizarrely as if they have some stake in the outcome, and as if they stand to lose something with a NO vote.

This leads to believe Scenario A is the correct scenario, and thus that the European position is a disinformation campaign and an unethical intervention into a national Greek matter. 

As for this: 

&gt; With no solution, the Greek state will run out of money and will need to issue a new currency to be able to function at least somewhat.

If you know how money is actually created, you'd know that technically Greece can have its banks buy specially created Greek sov bonds and then loan back the money to the Gov with a loan of offsetting terms. That would mean instant liquidity to the Gov, and that it could meet its internal obligations without switching currency.

Yes, it's breaking the Basel accords, and ECB rules about solvency of financial institutions (who fail the Acid Test) but Greece will end up breaking a rule anyway, and better this than Drachma. 

There's a lot of simplistic thinking and conclusions in the media, who don't understand how things in the financial system actually work, so don't be surprised if some unforeseen Greek action happens.

Deutschland hat nach dem Krieg dreimal Reparation an Griechenland geleistet: 

- bis 1950 30.000 Tonnen Industriegüter im Zeitwert von rund 25 Millionen Dollar, heute ungefähr zwei Milliarden Euro

- 1953 einen Investitionskredit von 200 Millionen Mark mit extrem langer Rückzahlungsdauer (99 Jahre) 

- 1960 115 Millionen DM per Vertrag als abschließende Zahlung

&gt;Auch die Griechen haben damals 50% der Schulden den Deutschen erlassen.

Höchst unfreiwillig. [Die Vorgeschichte sieht da doch etwas anders aus:](http://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article115104254/500-Milliarden-Euro-fuer-Griechenland.html)

&gt;Nach der Kapitulation Deutschlands fand im Herbst 1945 auf Einladung der Siegermächte in Paris eine erste Reparationskonferenz statt. Die griechische Übergangsregierung forderte seinerzeit zehn Milliarden US-Dollar, also die Hälfte der von den Sowjets vorgeschlagenen Gesamtreparationssumme Deutschlands von 20 Milliarden. Diese Forderung war freilich schon im Februar 1945 von den USA und Großbritannien als zu hoch beurteilt worden.

""It is hard to advise Greeks how to vote on 5 July. Neither alternative – approval or rejection of the troika’s terms – will be easy, and both carry huge risks. A yes vote would mean depression almost without end. Perhaps a depleted country – one that has sold off all of its assets, and whose bright young people have emigrated – might finally get debt forgiveness; perhaps, having shrivelled into a middle-income economy, Greece might finally be able to get assistance from the World Bank. All of this might happen in the next decade, or perhaps in the decade after that.

By contrast, a no vote would at least open the possibility that Greece, with its strong democratic tradition, might grasp its destiny in its own hands. Greeks might gain the opportunity to shape a future that, though perhaps not as prosperous as the past, is far more hopeful than the unconscionable torture of the present.

This, in turn, makes the perceived meaning of the question vital, and Greeks have been getting mixed signals -- the government tells them they will keep the euro either way and that the vote is about whether or not they want more austerity, while the creditors say it's about whether or not they want to stay in the Eurozone (and then some say it doesn't necessarily mean that).

&gt;Tja, das hätte man vielleicht vorher fragen sollen, als die Frage noch war, ob die Banken den Schuldenschnitt akzeptieren sollen oder die Steuerzahler.

Das wäre größtenteils auf dasselbe hinausgelaufen, denn fast alle Steuerzahler sind auch Bankkunden. Ist der Begriff von den ""systemrelevanten"" Banken noch in Erinnerung, *""too big to fail""*?

null,false,BorgDrone,NETH,The Netherlands,null,"&gt; What is that supposed to mean? Everyone paying into the system collectively is the entire point of a public welfare system. That's what makes it work in the first place.

But that's not how it works in Greece. They refuse to pay taxes yet they do expect a pension after (very early) retirement. Where does this money come from ? Loans from the rest of Europe. 

The greek have been living above their means for decades and now they are presented with the bill they refuse to pay it and expect others to pay for them. 

We've had budget cut after budget cut and everybody suffered from this, especially the elderly, ill and other weaker groups in our society. Taxes have been raised, social security has been gutted and all because 'Europe wants us to have our budget in order'. There have been endless debates on this, where to cut and who is going to suffer most. Yet at the same time as we're gutting our social security to save a few billion and get our budget in order, we're giving the Greek billions in loans without question just so they can keep living above their means. 

Now, after years of cuts and raised taxes, we're finally starting to do well and there is a little surplus (€5B) that the government wanted to use to lower taxes a little. At that very moment an IMF report was leaked that basically said: ""Yeah you guys should give the greek €5B for free"". Like hell we do. 

&gt; When you retire, everyone else will pay for your retirement. 

That only works if the people who are currently working pay taxes (and it's basically a pyramid scheme so we need to get rid of it ASAP), which the greek refuse to do. So at the moment taxpayers from other european countries are paying for the greek's early retirements. 

Also, retirement here is based on the amount of years worked, you get 2% of the max pension for every year worked. That means you only get the full amount if you worked 50 years (starting at 15 until 65), so in a way it *is* based on how much the individual paid. Most people start work much later and get less pension. 40 years is about average, which means 80% of the max pension, which is about €850 net for a person living alone. This is about on par with the greek pensions (except we have to work until 67 now and can't retire at 50 like the greek). 

But, that's not the whole picture of course, there is also the supplementary plan, which is why our pensions seem higher than the greek pensions. This supplementary plan is absolutely, 100% paid for by the individual. Basically, each month a certain amount (based on age and some other factors) is deducted from my gross salary and put into a pension plan (most of it disappears into the pockets of the shady financial corporations that run these as 'operating costs' or whatever, it's not very transparent). What is left of it after the banksters take their share is invested (depending on the plan you can choose in what, and how much risks you want to take). Once you retire you have saved a certain amount which you can then *only* use to buy an supplementary pension with an insurance company (which will basically mean you will get shafted by said insurance companies *again*). It is also taxed as income when it's paid out.

This supplementary pension is not optional. 

&gt; When you become unemployed, everyone else will subsidize your unemployment. 

Not really. You pay every month for this, and the length of unemployment is based on the number of years worked and thus based on the amount you paid into the scheme. 

&gt; When you are poor and destitute, then everyone else will pay so you can afford food and shelter.

Again, it's not as simple as that. There are strict requirements for this and the government can require you to work for your money, that is: they will offer you some demeaning work you have to do and if you refuse they will cut your social security. 

Same goes for people unable to work, the rules for that have been tightened so much that even severely handicapped people do not qualify for it. Even the possibility that maybe, in the future you can do work means no disability payments. You also have to be completely unable to work, so if your tongue is wet and you can move one arm and you can just barely lick stamps for 1 hour a week then you are able to work and thus do not qualify for disability. 

This saved us a lot of money we then dumped into the bottomless pit that is Greece.

&gt;Lewis Douglas, chief adviser to General Lucius Clay, U.S. High Commissioner, denounced JCS Directive 1067 saying, ""This thing was assembled by economic idiots. It makes no sense to forbid the most skilled workers in Europe from producing as much as they can in a continent that is desperately short of everything"" Douglas went to Washington in the hopes of having the directive revised but was unable to do so.

[Die Änderung kam 1947:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgenthau_Plan#JCS_1067)

&gt;In July 1947 JCS 1067, which had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in Germany to ""...take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany [or] designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy"", was replaced by JCS 1779 which instead stated that ""An orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.""

Followed by:

&gt; These middle east/african migrants are not educated, do not posses skills that are beneficial to our economy and arguably, do not integrate easily due to vast cultural differences.

And when I said a substantial proportion of the british population i'm not saying a majority but according to most polling data I've seen there are a ton who are preoccupied by it to say the least. And again it also becomes very evident by how much air time this topic takes up. 

I personally think tht thats a load of crap however and that most migrants, whether they come from Slovakia or Syria will likely have useful skills and will contribute to the country having been given the chance. There are also going to be problems associated with integrating both groups into society and you could argue that there might be more coming from a country like Syria but I simply don't buy your BS when you (very strongly) imply that these people are sponges who will jump ship at the nearest opportunity.

If they hadn't had done this, Knuckleheads like yourself would have prevented Greece from instituting reform by itself. This means that Greece would have to continue servicing its debts and spending commitments on the free market, which would have increased the rate of interest on loans because Greece is becoming a liability.

The most likely outcome of this would have been a Greek default, which would have collapsed the national banking system of  whilst harming international banks. Regular people use banks, not just the rich. Greeks and potentially others in the EU would have seen their savings diminish considerably. Of course, this is assuming the EU didn't pre-emptively expel Greece to prevent economic harm to its people and institutions.

Sure there is. For example, what negotiations are there to be done, whether or not a 'No' vote or 'Yes' vote is returned? 

Is there still an offer for a bailout package that Greeks can accept, or is there not? Is there only the offer in the 3rd bailout request, which hasn't been approved or denied, or is there the possibility to return to the negotiating table to complete negotiations?

We don't even know what the situation is to which this referendum refers. We might have Creditors extending the process implicitly but stating the opposite. Otherwise their desire to be a part of the Referendum and their statements about the results of a 'No' vote make no sense whatsoever. 

It's totally unclear.

&gt;  A ""no"" vote would mean that the voters reject those conditions and by extension, the offer of further credit.

What conditions? What offer? What credit? On what package?

&gt; In other words, the Greek government would have run out of the last lender willing to extend credit. It would be unable to spend one cent more than it collects in taxes: instant austerity. But that's not all: If the ECB sticks to its rules - which Varoufakis gambles it won't - it cannot then keep lending Euros to Greek banks after a ""no"" vote. 

Why does the vote matter? The programme expired, didn't it? Didn't Greece default on its EFSF package, and in response, didn't the EFSF decide to reserve its rights to accelerate Greek loans at a later date if it chooses? They're already in default, aren't they?.

And just you know, the ELA isn't 'loaned.' It's printed. It's created by the CBG and only creates a Target2 liability in the system. Neither the ECB nor the CBG in fact, as ELA creditors, would ever be required to pay back, or eat, the extended ELA funds in the event of a default.

[Here](http://karlwhelan.com/blog/?p=182) is a briefing paper written by an Irish Economist Karl Whelan about the subject. 

Note this:

&gt; Target2 balances simply reflect the outcome of private decentralised transactions and there is no system whereby a Target2 creditor is under an obligation to “repay” the Target2 liabilities under any particular time-frame.

Greece does have an obligation to repay extended ELA, but it's not a 'loan' in the sense of the way you're using it.

&gt; These banks own large amounts in Greek government bonds which a) will drag them down into insolvency and b) cannot be used as deposits at the ECB.

Irrelevant under capital controls. Also irrelevant if the Ref refers to a negotiation that can resume after the outcome. The position of the banks will definitely be a crucial problem to resolve in any final solution. If there is no negotiation, then the banks will automatically become insolvent the moment ELA runs out, or capital controls are lifted. The vote outcome has no bearing on this.

&gt; These banks own large amounts in Greek government bonds which a) will drag them down into insolvency and b) cannot be used as deposits at the ECB.

Unless there are negotiations to which Greece can return, a 'No' vote, exactly as a 'Yes' vote, is meaningless.

&gt; The only way out of the latter problem would be a return to the Drachma.

The point of bringing up odious debt was to highlight this relationship. Running a budget deficit isn't the underlying problem, or necessarily a bad thing; America has been doing it for the majority of years since 1970.

Ceding Srebrenica for peace would be a good plan. In 1995 Croats and Bosniaks ceded parts of western Bosnia they liberated so that Dayton can happen.

Ceding Srebrenica doesn't mean the West wanted massacres ..... that's on Serbs hands. It's just that territory was swapped in the end.

There is nothing really shocking if they discussed ceding completely surrounded enclave. 

&gt;For me, the largest part that the west played in the whole affair from the very beginning was imposing the arms embargo. That was the true role that the west played in the fall of Srebrenica. 

That fucked us as well. And it was waaaaaaaaaaaaaay before Srebrenica. We had to smuggle weapons in the begining of our war and had close to nothing.

By 1995 and time Srebrenica fell embargo was just for show .... we were able to buy whatever we needed and even Iranian planes were landing in Croatia with weapons for Bosniaks with American support.

Iranian (and other) planes would land in Zagreb and our air force would fly weapons to places like Bihać in Bosnia and supply them with weapons.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/22/warcrimes.comment

&gt;Arms purchased by Iran and Turkey with the financial backing of Saudi Arabia made their way by night from the Middle East. Initially aircraft from Iran Air were used, but as the volume increased they were joined by a mysterious fleet of black C-130 Hercules aircraft. The report stresses that the US was ""very closely involved"" in the airlift. Mojahedin fighters were also flown in, but they were reserved as shock troops for especially hazardous operations. 

-

&gt;Light weapons are the familiar currency of secret services seeking to influence such conflicts. The volume of weapons flown into Croatia was enormous, partly because of a steep Croatian ""transit tax"". Croatian forces creamed off between 20% and 50% of the arms. The report stresses that this entire trade was clearly illicit. The Croats themselves also obtained massive quantities of illegal weapons from Germany, Belgium and Argentina - again in contravention of the UN arms embargo. The German secret services were fully aware of the trade.

I'm not sure I understand your sentence. But when German companies get caught at it they will be prosecuted too. The ""getting caught bit"" is the tricky part. When you pay bribes in a foreign country, you don't normally leave a paper trail at home. Export managers want to bring contracts back home, but they don't want to go to prison because of it. Bribing of local officials is left to local agents or subsidiaries. Everybody who has worked in 3rd world countries knows that all companies have to pay bribes, just like Fifa delegates from the 3rd world receive bribes as if it were part of their salary. That has been public knowledge for decades.

The bottom line is that Greek corruption can only be fought by transparent government in Greece, e.g., making military procurement public.

It's somehow the melancholy of the big and open seas, it has passion, but more... sad and philosophical, dreamy passion, while Bulgarian traditional music (also - Serbian, Hungarian and the middle of Europe) have a bit different kind of energy - more like storms or fire type of passion. 
Even in the so famous sirtaki you can feel it. (Unfortunately I still haven't seen the movie, but I've watched an amazing ballet-musical on it.)

According to greek laws if a referendum takes place with 40%+ participation it had a legal aspect and it has to become a law,which might not be a big deal but it will make the ppl voting yes to hesitate.By offering another agreement they make the referendum having no other reason and no instant legalization aspect .Except for giving the syriza political party their support and imo with the public support they could get a better deal out of it,the acts of euro officials have proven this i think.

For those who havent read the differences between the 2propositions they re not too big,which makes the european attitude towards this unacceptable.


The main differences are on the taxing of islands(which hits our tourism)  and the taxing of the shipoweners and the commercial naval side which is one of the biggest income sources of greece .
On the other hand the Greek government wanted to tax ppl with fat salaries and redistribute the taxing of islands.

there are also differences on the pensions and on privatisations but thats all....syrizas approach is not the communist act that they might tell you that is in the other countries but it was reasonable imo since their program promised to give the same ammount to the creditors.

However having to pay the debt by making us destroy our biggest sources of income because of economical interests of some of the euro countries is much more severe.

No, in realtà gli elementi da mostrare a video non sarebbero così tanti da creare problemi. Esistono numerosi ""visualizzatori"" in real time. Adesso va di moda Armok Vision, che però non ho ancora provato.

Il problema della grafica è che il gioco non può essere reso integralmente in 3D. Il mondo è fatto a cubetti. In ogni cubetto la disposizione degli oggetti e delle persone che ci possono stare dentro non corrisponde alle regole della fisica classica. Il concetto di volume è rispettato solo nelle interazioni ma non nelle posizioni. Per esempio, due draghi possono stare nello stesso quadretto e sono comunque grandi un quadretto, al pari di una mosca. In 2D il trucco è che ogni quadretto viene mostrato a rotazione: prima mostro un drago, poi l'altro, poi la mosca. In 3D puoi farlo, ma non stai migliorando granché la grafica, perché dovrai sempre visualizzare un solo elemento per volta e non riuscirai comunque a visualizzare l'interazione.

Per questo motivo Dwarf Fortress avrà magari visualizzatori più complessi, che interagiscono meglio con le funzionalità di gioco, ma non evolverà mai in una roba tipo minecraft, per dire.

&gt;Cosa ne pensi dei giochi simile a DF ma con grafica?

Non ne ho mai visti. I pochi tentativi tipo Gnomoria e Towns si sono schiantati dopo poco. Aspetto Castle Story ma anche lì la vedo grigia. Apprezzo invece i giochi ispirati a Dwarf Fortress, tipo Prison Architect, che hanno un approccio simile al design del gameplay ma si fermano ad una serie di obiettivi realistici, senza voler copiare una cosa impossibile da copiare.",null,0,null,1436106379,null,0,1436106633,0,csstyjd,null,t3_3c73uf,null,t1_csstyjd,null,t1_csstuss,null,null,null,1437602800,null,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3,null

Well sure it is political, did not mean to imply it was not. The ELA has hit the ceiling so they would need to vote to put it up again from the current €89bn, and decided not to. It is getting hard to argue that this is temporary funding to solvent banks though.
The total outstanding private debt of the government is about €34bn, and about €13bn is held by the greek, banks. Not zero, but not so important.
What is more important is the collateral the banks are currently using to borrow from the ECB is some sort of weird instrument created by the Greek government. Will have to look up the details a bit more.
Collateral is another matter. The ELA is secured by a hodgepodge of collateral: some of the banks’ loans, some covered bonds, a little bit of government debt. For the four big banks, though, a special kind of government-guaranteed bond makes up a large chunk of the collateral.
That means to keep ELA going, the ECB must primarily assess whether the government’s guarantee is solid enough to make the collateral adequate. It’s a judgment call.

Nous nous sommes mal compris, en citant le Dr.Bydlowski (qui estime que la PMA doit être réservée au traitement de l’infertilité) je parlait que de la fécondation in vitro, pour moi la GPA est commercialisation des êtres humains inacceptable et une marchandisation de la femme dégueulasse.

Dans le cas de la fécondation/insémination in vitro, tu a raison, on élimine un malfonctionnement biologique pour ensuite observer une grossesse ""normal"". Pour la GPA c'est différent puisque le malfonctionnement n'existe pas, il est parfaitement normal que deux hommes/femmes ne puisse pas procréer. Si un droit à l'enfant existe alors la seul solution serait la location d'une mère porteuse donc la GPA.

In the beginning, the AfD was simply a mix of Liberal Conservatives and Neoliberals with a strong focus on technocracy and Realpolitik regardless of popularity.

By his account, he was one of the ""average"" AfD: Economy degree, mid- to high-level banker, classic liberal beliefs with conservative leanings similar to the conservative wing of the old FDP. But as the party was portrayed as right-wing and populist in the media, more and more right-wing populists felt attracted to it, slowly shifting the core of the  party in that direction.

Thus, the allegations of extremism became more and more true, which obviously isn't tolerable company for a technocrat with a reputation in society to lose. So they started bleeding members who simply wanted to do Realpolitik, accelerating the process. He himself has left quite a while ago because his goals were unachievable with the current structure, and as is evident from the news, this election the point where a lot of people decided the same.

The AfD is effectively nonexistent now compared to their beginnings and has completely transformed.

Of course the media isn't exclusively to blame, the party made a lot of mistakes because they were new and hadn't expected to have to defend against a threat from the inside in this way. But from past experiences with similar situations, I'd definitely say there was a campaign to transform them in this way - old-fashioned liberal conservatism just isn't something that goes well with the average journalist.

Oh well, too bad, it's sad - Germany _direly_ needs a liberal party.

&gt;No, but if it is important enough, people find a way to pay for it out of revenues. Apparently collecting taxes is less important to you than paying pensions to the wealthy or subsidising rich people on Greek islands.

No shit. Do you specialise in missing the point, or is it just a natural talent that you were born with?

So basically an eye for an eye plus personal attacks to round off your argument? I'm actually interested in discussing this topic, so I'm going to ignore any personal attacks and focus on the arguments henceforth.

&gt; No, I explicitly discuss the need for a unified, structured industrialisation and development programme, not making a ""gift"" of money to Greece. 

Call it whatever political terms you want, an ""investment"", an ""aid package"", it's a gift with terms of how to spend it, but a gift nonetheless. Other struggling European economies (Spain, Portugal, Ireland) will scream unfair and want a similar package, something the Eurozone can ill afford.

&gt; The policy in Germany worked - it was smart economic policy that enabled a completely crippled economy to become the economic powerhouse of Europe.

That's really oversimplifying. Germany was an economic and industrial powerhouse prior to the war, setback only due to the destruction of the war. The problem isn't structural but rather transient.

Greece, on the other hand (along with many struggling European countries), has shown no sign of similar vitality for the past century or two, and I find that the problems are ingrained and structural (e.g. political corruption, tax avoidance) that a one-time injection of money simply can't solve.

&gt; The policy in Greece isn't working - it's shit-tier economics that, even the Troika admits in its leaked documents, will leave Greece with unsustainable levels of debt by 2030.

I have NEVER said that the troika's austerity worked. What I did claim is that regardless of what Greece chooses now, they will have to undergo austerity since no one lends to a bankrupt state, and there is no political will globally to give them money in any way. Remember that the rest of the European countries are democracies too and current voter sentiment is VERY against giving any more money to Greece.

null,false,smacksaw,CANA,Canada,null,"&gt; As for ""austerity"", a word that has been thorougly demonized, it doesn't mean much more than ""when you're broke, spend less"". You are broke. Spend less. The idea that you have a choice relies on someone else footing the bill.

Let's say it's you as a person.

You clear $2000/mo.

You pay $1000 in rent. $400 for your transportation costs. $100 for internet, home and mobile. 

That leaves you $500.

The problem is that you got sick last year and charged up your credit cards to pay for it. Your minimum balances are $600/mo. You keep paying your card to live off of it.

Where do you cut?

You can continue to pay your minimum balance on your cards. In 20-40 years you will have paid them off. You also will have paid 900% of your borrowed debt.

You can stop paying rent, but then you're homeless.

You can stop paying transportation costs, but then you can't get to and from work where you earn money.

You can stop paying your credit cards which will wreck your credit and cause you to get lots of unpleasant phone calls.

What do you do?

Well, if you've ever heard of debt negotiation, they tell you to stop paying your debts. It's important to live and keep living. 

Then, after some time you are able to negotiate your debt. Say you owe $20,000 to your cards. Eventually you'll be able to settle it all for about $6k or so. If you save some of your money each month instead of paying debt, you can go to the first card and offer them $1200 to settle the account. $4000 in debt, wiped out. 

That's how debt negotiation works. You spend less. You spend less on debt. 

See, your assumption is that Greece is spending their money frivilously. ""Oh, the pensions"" we hear. 

Guess what? The high pensions are nothing more than a clever wealth distribution scheme designed to prop up the economy; nothing more. They're not like the USA spending massive amounts of money policing the world. Are they still corrupt? Sure. But who lends money to someone you know is corrupt? Caveat Emptor.
