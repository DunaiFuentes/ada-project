And the EU and US would have welcomed that. The EU was willing to trade with Ukraine. That is not the same as a military intervention. 

I think all of those separatist regions need to be evaluated on a case by case basis. But there is one common denominator in all of them, and that is Russia. 

&gt;You are not telling me that the Transnistrians separated because Russia didn't want Moldova to trade wine do you?

No, but as soon as Moldova tried signing a trade deal with the EU Russia banned its wine imports on ""consumer protection"" grounds. The Russian Ambassador to Moldova also said that Russia could expel all of the Moldovans working there, which make up a very substantial portion of Moldova's GDP. So it is not as if you can make the claim Ukraine is an isolated incident. If Moldovans began rioting because of those threats or the import ban I would be surprised if Russia did not hold a ""referendum"" in Transnistria. 

&gt;My viewpoint is much more common in Eastern Europe than it is in Western Europe. It's just not the majority viewpoint.

I think you got the regions backwards but I understand what you are saying. I would just like to see Western EU leadership take Eastern leaders' views into account more, instead of condescendingly dismissing them or not even acknowledging them. I would not say your view is too uncommon in Western EU leadership. I would just like to see those leaders give their fellow EU members' situation precedence over Russia's.

Which they fullfill as far as i know. Greece got a lot of money over the years and cheap as loans with minimal interest rates which should help a lot normally.  

&gt;Greece cannot get loans to rebuild because the markets don't believe that the EU will back these loans. It's simple as that.

Obvioulsy because giving them loans means you don't get it back so its not a loan but a gift. How are people suprised by that? Greece doesn't want loans it wants more subsidies called ""loans"". To be honest i guess the EU should pump money into Greece but at the same time everybody should make sure the money helps. I just think its hilarious how people talk about the Greece issue at what point do people stop shift blame around and start making solutions.

The recently published GDP figures cited in the article are seasonally adjusted, and indeed chained volume series adjusted and therefore they do account for the effects of price changes (inflation or deflation).

GDP quarterly growth: 0.7%

That's all well and good but the fact that GDP has fallen so quickly continues to result in a decrees in tax intake. Thus, the budget surplus is never going to exceed a level in which Greece will be able to actually reduce their current debt to gdp ratio.

""The eurozone is already insulated from Greek debt.""

Define exactly what you mean by this. Banks perhaps to a certain extent but certainly not the ECB. In fact, the ECB have taken on much of the debt, thus the euro as a currency would dramatically fall in the event of a default.

If Russia successfully developed an ABM system that it could have such extremely high confidence in that it could carry out a nuclear preemptive strike without fears of retaliation, that would be a way in which it would change the balance on nuclear terms.

* Russia *could* grow her economy.  China did it.  It probably requires Russia to diversify her economy and to privatize.  It'd still be a challenge to compete with NATO, but Russia has room for economic growth, if it made the right moves.

* Russia could figure out some brilliantly-more-effective way of making use of military spending.  Maybe she mass-produces armed drones or other autonomous vehicles.

Ladies and Gentlement, with great joy I received Mr Dijsselbloem today in in Athens and in our ministry Daiselblum president of Eurogroup.

We started this first process of knowing each other which I am sure will be the basis of one fruitfull relationship, exactly like Greek, eurozone and EU interest calls for.

Our conversation took place under great spirit. We discussed a variaty of issues pertaining to the Eurozone with great emphasis in the creation of a climate of confidence which will lead to a new agreement in the Eurozone, for one Greece that can breath inside an evolving/developing Europe, a Europe who is a place for prosperity for all the European nations.

For my part, I informed mr Dijsselbloem about the priorities of our government as far as the economic policy is concerned and especilly our commitment to the reforms that are required for the minimization of ""money grabbing"" which has affected Greece so long, even before the eurozone 
was established. The reforms that must be deep and be executed without passion or fear, reforms which will restore the competitiveness of this country. I also talked about the guarantee our governent is prepared to offer, firstly to the Greek People and secondly to the other EU members, for balanced budgets with a small primary surplus in perpetuity. 

We talked about a series of issues pertaining to the way Greece and the Eurozone relationship will progress the following months and lastly I made known the fact that while the state has continuity, we will not accept the same continuity of the selfsustaining crisis, deflation and non sustainable debt.

Thank you very much.

I don't think this is fair for workers. A work contract is a two way obligations type of deal. Or should be.

Doesn't temporary work do just that already? If you have the need for a employee for 3 months only, hire him with a 3 month contract. If your need is permanent, give him a permanent job. There are laws in place already to avoid companies repeatedly hiring someone for temporary contracts, though they are easily circumvented.

&gt;What parsimonious nonsense. If we can forgive Germany's debts after WW2 we can forgive Greece's debts. 

Germany got those debts in order to rebuild after a devastating war while parts of the population were in danger of starvation. Greece got those debts while financing a bloated, corrupt public system and a huge, ineficient army. I don't think one can easily compare the two. Also, last time Germany was left indepted like a slave they built a crazy ass ideology, a big army and started WWII.

&gt;Germany lending their number one purchaser of arms silly amounts of money whilst clearly not raising sufficient taxes to pay it back and being ruled by a corrupt political elite was reckless lending. Germans should be angry with their government and banks not the Greek people. 

So by this logic if I am a member of your family and you lend me money for my betting addiction, I promise I'll quit but I neither quit nor pay you back then it's your own fault because you should have known that I'm an untrustworthy bastard.

Getting back to the topic, did those greek governments materialise out of thin air?  They came from within and were put in power by the greek people. I don't think the majority of germans thought about WWII when they democratically elected the nazis, but are they responsible for what happened next?  Sure they are. The greek people made bad choices with their governments and nobody forced debt on them appart from their freely chosen elites. That's the responsibility of democracy and saying that they do not SHRE the blame is ignorant.

null,false,Canadianman22,CANA,Commonwealth Member,null,"BRUSSELS—NATO will establish command centers in six of its eastern countries in coming months, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday, in part of a beefed-up response to Russian aggressiveness.

The outposts will form a chain of potential command centers for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s already announced new rapid-response force, which will consist of roughly 5,000 troops. Details are to be finalized at a meeting next week of NATO defense ministers.

The centers also will provide a link between NATO and the armed forces of the six countries where they will be located—Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

Mr. Stoltenberg announced the new centers at a news conference in Brussels, where he also urged NATO allies to spend more on defense to counter Russia’s military budget. Mr. Stoltenberg also said he would meet with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in the sidelines of a security conference in Munich in two weeks.

“Especially when times are difficult, as they are now, it is important to meet and discuss also difficult issues,” Mr. Stoltenberg said.

The command centers are intended partly as a warning to Russia and a reassurance to NATO allies who have become increasingly jittery following Moscow’s aggressive actions in Ukraine and elsewhere.

The creation of the spearhead rapid-response force, designed to mobilize within two days in case of a belligerent move by an adversary, is the highest-profile move by NATO to bolster its defenses in the aftermath of Russia’s takeover of Crimea and its incursions into eastern Ukraine, which Moscow denies.

“This will be the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the Cold War,” Mr. Stoltenberg said.

Each command center will likely be staffed by about 50 military personnel from various NATO countries. The outposts are in a sense a compromise between NATO’s eastern countries, some of whom want full-scale NATO bases on their territory, and other members wary of building expensive new installations that could provoke Moscow.

The six centers will also help manage the greatly increased NATO exercises being conducted in these countries near Russia. And they’ll ensure that NATO forces are deeply familiar with their military landscape should they have to deploy there in a crisis.

The command centers will open by 2016, when the spearhead force is scheduled to be in full operation. In the meantime, an interim rapid-response force is being headed by Germany, the Netherlands and Norway.

At next week’s meeting of NATO defense ministers, individual countries are expected to announce they will take responsibility for coordinating one of the spearhead force’s units. When the force is full operation, one unit will be on full alert status an any given time, while another will be gearing up and a third will be standing down.

Mr. Stoltenberg discussed the new outposts, to be called “NATO Force Integration Units,” at a wide-ranging press discussion with reporters. He called 2014 a “black year” for European security, marked by Russia’s assertiveness, the threat of terrorism and turmoil in the Middle East.

Mr. Stoltenberg said it is critical that NATO’s European members spend more on defense. In 2014 NATO countries spent about $852 billion on defense, he said, $7 billion less than the year before.

NATO is working to become more efficient, the secretary-general said. “But in the long run it is not possible to get more out of less indefinitely,” he added. “That is why we have to stop the cuts and gradually start to increase defense spending as our economies grow.”

&gt;How did the markets 'know' they won't get their money back?

Who cares? They got cheap ass loans far cheaper than anything the market would provide them with. And they don't want to pay this cheap ass loans who in their right mind would give money after that? Most off the time the market know who is credible and who is not. Funny enough the rating for Greece were droped heavily and now Greece talks about defaulting. Thats no coincedence.

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Today I had very fruitful meetings with members of the new government. Apart from the Minister Varoufakis, I spoke with the Prime Minister Tsipras, the Deputy Prime Minister Dragasaki,the Minister Stathakis and Deputy Minister Tsakalotos.I hope I didn't mispronounce the names. I know my name is difficult too, so forgive me. With Greece nearing the end of the program, we had good reason to get to know each other and start our collaboration as soon as possible. So I am so grateful for this meeting today. The purpose of my meeting is twofold. To hear the intentions of the new Greek government and to explain the requirements of the agreements.
As members of the eurozone we have mutual interests: Further recovery of Greek economy in the Eurozone. I was happy to hear today that it is the ambition of the new government as well. Both parties want Greece to regain financial independence as soon as possible, to strengthen fiscal sustainability and external competitiveness of Greece and ensure the stability of the financial sector.

In 2012 Eurogroup stated their commitment to provide adequate support to Greece during the entire duration of the program and beyond, until Greece regain access to markets, provided of course that Greece fully complies with the requirements and objectives. It is of paramount importance for Greece to stay on track to recovery. This of course requires a commitment to the reform process and to fiscal sustainability.

Unilateral steps and ignoring previous agreements are not a way forward. The problems of the Greek economy did not disappear nor have they changed overnight with these elections. There are still major challenges for the future in order to deliver sustainable growth, create new jobs and  confidence for the Greek economy and to create new opportunities for the youth, for all the young people.

I realize that the Greek people in recent years had to endure and suffer harsh measures. However, there has been significant progress guiding Greece into the right course. It is important that this progress is not wasted. The new government is determined to find solutions that are profitable for both sides. For Greece and its people, but also for the eurozone. And we are very grateful for that.

It is now up to the Greek government, the new Greek government, to determine its position and it is up to us together with the new government and its partners in the eurozone to move forward. And we are ready to do so. Thank you.",null,0,null,1422643510,null,0,1422645767,0,co5yql5,null,t3_2u7fc5,null,t1_co5yql5,null,t1_co5xtd3,null,null,null,1424303049,null,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9,null

First, I want it to be presented as it is — an act of ethnic cleansing, and not a genocide. It doesn't fit the WWII definition of genocide. However, the definition of genocide was later changed so that any individual act committed by just one person can be considered a genocide if the intent was to destroy a specific group.

Words aren't *just* words. They carry emotions, feelings and experiences associated with them. This is especially the case with a word as heavy as *genocide*. When you invoke a word, you invoke all of those emotions, feelings and experiences, which is why it is extremely unfair and manipulative to silently change the definition of the word for it to mean something else.

When you label something with the word the definition of which was manipulated heavily, that thing unjustly invokes the same emotions, feelings and experiences that were associated with the original definition of the word.

The word *genocide* invokes the memories and experiences of the WWII atrocities and invokes all emotions and feelings towards those atrocities. It implies large scale, systematic, meticulous, state-wide, almost industrial extermination of an entire race or ethnic group planned and orchestrated by the highest levels of government and includes the complicity in and knowledge of such plans by the vast network of people, if not the entire public.

None of that happened in the 90's wars, but the legal definition of the word *genocide* was changed so that a lot of things can be fit into that new definition.

I was never justifying the crimes of the Serbs committed in the 90's. I was objecting to the manipulation of the definition of the heavy word *genocide* which was later unjustly attached to both Serbs and Republika Srpska as a collective, through legal manipulation.

Io ho detto: no, pensaci: se fosse normale (quindi una cosa che si verifica, in media) avresti circa un giorno di malattia ogni 8 per tutto l'inverno.

Stimo ad occhio un numero di giorni di malattia di uno al mese in inverno, con varianza uno, siamo tre sigma oltre la media, probabilmente è successo qualcosa di anomalo quel giorno per avere un numero di assenti così alto.

There are many other places as well, although the ideologies differ. The civil war in Sudan. Somalia. Nigeria (Boko Haram). There are countless other countries that do not send political dissidents to death camps but imprison them. Some of the EU/US' largest trading partners do this. China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and countless others. 

I dont think the West can fix the world, but there are plenty of problems where we would prefer to look the other way. In many instances I can understand that argument (given the fact intervention could cause a bigger mess), but it is still choosing inaction over action. 

Look at how the West initially reacted to the genocides in the Balkans, and that was on the European continent. If it required more than booking a conference center in Zurich it was not considered to be worth the effort. It took a massacre of thousands to prompt the West to finally intervene, and much of the push came from US President Clinton's personal direction of US forces. If a more non-interventionist leader was in power I am not sure how much longer it would have went on.

I went to Spain last year and loved it. I am not familiar with Spain's politics/government and I find your insight truly fascinating. Do you know what sort of employment practices/policies exist at the level of government that create this mentality? Are there powerful worker unions? 

My perception is that it was merely a preference for time with family/friends over work. In the U.S. we generally ""live to work,"" with career being of the utmost importance at the expense of leisure/social activity. There, it seemed the Spanish generally ""work to live."" Service was better for locals/regulars than tourists or strangers. For example an owner of a shop stopped helping me when his buddy walked in, he didn't need my business so dropped what he was doing to talk. The next day though, when I went back, he recognized me and apologized; we must have talked for an hour. 

Cashiers/bartenders did not like it when I was strictly business (just handing them money without acknowledgement), they wanted to chat and be treated like human beings - not ATMs. 

The ""pringado"" thing made me think of another example: One night stumbling home drunk, some guys tried to pinch my wallet. They were drunk too, more so than I, and I caught them redhanded. Yelled at them and went off but wandering around trying to find my street, I ran into them again maybe 10 minutes later. We ended up laughing it off and chatting for a while, and I remember thinking this could never happen in the U.S.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to be a thing of 'faceless stranger' vs. an actual human being. If you're just one of the crowd then someone isn't going to care about you or do you any favors. If you have a story, a personality, and show compassion or interest and are genuinely down to earth than it will generally be reciprocated. A simple hello and a smile go a long way.

That seems a bit harsh. I am studying to take the licensing exam in a US state and we learn many of the old English Common Law crimes. I was not sure if the defense of self defense was an American construct or if it has just been legislated away in the UK. If someone breaks into someone else's house it seems like the presumption of innocence should be very strongly in favor of the home owner or tenant, but that is just my opinion. Many people in the US think the law is too lenient on home owners that use force. In several states there is a duty to retreat, even while in the home. But it certainly is not the norm. I personally think it is a ridiculous requirement, but I would not argue anyone else's opinion was wrong. Obviously there is plenty of room for debate.

Whenever the Troika threatened us (or was reported as having threatened us by our media, I don't know to what extent they were fabricating stories to support our previous governments' positions) that it would not give us part of the loan necessary to refinance our debt if we didn't implement some structural reform, it was about either horizontal spending cuts or abolishing labor laws (we have practically abolished collective bargaining agreements and are prohibited by law to even bargain for higher wages, which would under the current regime be optional for the employer federations anyway).

Always against the German government never against the people. Remember that!

As for the nazi images in some Greek newspapers I was also against them. It doesn't do good to remind the Germans what they did to us before and drawing parallels between military occupation and economic occupation is a stretch. The fact is, we don't need propaganda to see what is happening, we don't trust our media any more, we don't trust our governments or their foreign advisors. We were in the streets before the crisis, we were in the streets during the crisis and we will be there after. Democracy and self determination above all right?

Stereotypes become Stereotypes because they are reinforced by media. They work both ways. For example Germans (Stereotypes) think they know what is best for everyone and won't stop at world War to enforce it. Protestants believe that being strict and not thinking to much just following blindly the rules is virtuous. Etc etc. (for the record I don't believe any of these in just giving you the other side of Stereotypes). 

The discourse of economic matters is being reduced to easily digestible Stereotypes for the common voter so that they will vote for the same destructive party again. In the end let's leave the elected EU to do economic policy and not Germany by itself. Or else WE don't have any part in decision making. And this we cannot tolerate.

So Syriza is offering two options

I shared a 6 hour taxi ride with an Iraqi Kurd from Diyarbakir, Turkey to the border. The stories he told me were horrendous. He was born in a Ba'ath prison while his mom was handcuffed to a pipe. Her only medical treatment was from other female prisoners. Some of his brothers were tortured to death, some killed in bombings. When I told him he needed to write a book he laughed.

However, I cannot say if this kind of taxation was actually imposed by the troika in this exact form. Nearly every european country has a tax if this kind, in some countries, the tax has a share on the GDP twice the one in greece (the income of these countries did not go down though). So it might be that the troika said to greece that it needed to get up its taxes and suggested a property tax of this kind, but it is still the responsibility of the (former) greek government to specify and impose these taxes. The greek govenment might also have preferred putting the enfia this high in favor of not cutting something else.

The clear interest of the troika is to reduce the deficit of the government so greece can actually start repaying these taxes at some point, maybe they went over the top with their actions. I agree that this is really tough, especially if you see that there are actually almost no countries that actually run a budget surplus (I think germany in this year and liechtenstein, maybe a few more).

You're all tied to each other. That's what a currency union is. If 1 country goes down so do many of the others. 

You can't have a free lunch. You can't get something for nothing. The PIIGS found that out a few years ago, but the taxpayer in northern Europe must also discover this harsh truth as well.

After years of benefiting from the periphery countries being in the eurozone, only NOW do you suddenly whine about it? Prior to 2008 I never heard anyone questioning whether Greece, Spain etc should join the eurozone, the northern countries tripped over themselves to let them all in in an effort to devalue the currency and make exports more competitive! 

Suddenly now people realize that there's a price to pay for having a currency union. There's a price for having such massive trade surpluses, there's a price for having cheap holidays to Spain. Welcome to the fundamental economic fact of life. You can't get something for nothing. A real currency union has to be funded by fiscal transfers, from the richer more productive countries to the poorer, less productive countries. There isn't any other way for it to work. A currency union is a trade-off for everyone, not a free lunch. If you were sold the euro as something that would only benefit your country and have no costs associated with it, you were scammed. 

In a democracy you get the government that you deserve. The fact that you are a ""common tax payer"" is irrelevant, you indirectly caused the mess, you pay for it. The Greek voters have already paid a lot for a mess that was only partially created by themselves, what makes northern Europeans so special that they should be exempt from the consequences of political incompetence?

However if the victim was seen to be 'compos mentis' then I imagine a defence would be easier as it seems more plausible that the victim offered consent.

I guess your post shows that the ""propaganda"" worked on you at least partially. The point of propaganda often is that you don't know its propaganda. Look, reading your posts i think i notice a tendency of yours. You attribute a lot to Merkel/Germany. This is the agenda of the Greek press since the beginning. But most other countries are for the same course  of action as Germany. Germany because of its size has just more weight and therefore gets heard louder. Demonizing Germany ( a common enemy is a good thing for media and politics, always was ) seems to be the major agenda and it works. Whatever the reason for Greece problems are i doubt Germany is out to get you. Even if it would be true that Germanys plans are bad for Greece ( maybe true ) they are supported by most other major players. The ""hate"" for Germany seems irrational and overproportional considering that most countries agree. The agenda of the Greek media was blaming it on Merkel/Germany. World War 2 et cetera made this obviously easy and provided a lot of ammunition. Why hating on Germany and not all the other countries who think exactly the same?

Interestingly enough you damaged yourself with that. German tourists bring in serious money for all countries in Europe... . They actually spend the most of any country on non domestic tourism.

Edit: Actually the germans seem to travel more to Greece now :-) . Well i guess that supports my point that most Germans dont actually care that much about the ""crisis"" in Greece. Germans are by far biggest part of tourism in Greece.

All we need is for people to grow up and recognize that a new plan is needed to get the eurozone growing again, even if it does cost the taxpayer some money in the short term. 

The markets are not the problem here. Nothing good could come of going the Venezuelan or Russian route. The issue is political ineptitude and in-fighting amongst eurozone members.

No, you can't. But you can blame her for her sclerotic stance. She has literally disagreed with moving an inch from her original position. She's even complaining about the current too-little-too-late mild QE programme. 

&gt; Well is it their fault greece went into debt? Or are you talking about letting greece into the euro zone? 

The euro crisis is far more complex than that. It's not so much a debt crisis as an institutional crisis. Read [this](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-14-455_en.htm) or [this](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/economy/95989/eurozone-crisis-debt-dont-blame-greece) to get started. But even if we look at it solely from a debt perspective, it's still not only Greece's fault: for every irresponsible debtor there must be an equally irresponsible lender.

&gt; So you cannot really assume that they wanted the privatization to buy it themselves.

That's what I said. There is no reason to believe that the privatisations were prescribed by the Germans because they were eyeing those assets themselves. 

&gt; OPAP was bought by some czech-greek group

It was actually just a collaboration of a Czech oligarch with a known Greek oligarch. 

&gt; Where is the fault here? Of course they would try this. Everyone would try this and it was the basic principle that you dont have to guarantee for any other countrys debt.

The problem is twofold: 

1. If you try to lend as little as possible to Greece in the short-term, then the combined effect of austerity will make its debt situation worse, which means you will have to give more money in the long term to bail them out. It's like going to the store and buying the cheapest piece of crap you find because you want to be frugal but because you decided to do that the piece of crap breaks so you pay more money in the long term. 

2. In a monetary union, it's impossible to have a no bailout clause, that no country should guarantee another country's debt. German voters were deceived when they were told this would be the case for the euro. It's basically impossible.

What do they do to bankrupt people in your country, then? Throw them in debtors prison?

Do you protest every week about businesses and individuals that borrow money and then don't pay it back? Is it morally wrong now not to pay off debt that you can't afford? Hundreds of Estonian companies default on their obligations every year, and for individuals the figures are likely even higher. Much of that written-off debt in corporate bankruptcies is often tax bills, bills from suppliers, peoples wages, orders from customers, etc. That's something you pay for. Every day you pay for other peoples failures because that's how the real world works, it's the only way an economy can function long-term. 

Not everyone pays their loans, and sometimes it's in the best interests of both parties to re-structure the debt or write some of it off. That is how the real world works. I understand that the eurozone has been trying to exist outside of reality for several years now but that is really no excuse.

Avec des heurts oui mais bon nombre de paysans connaissaient très bien le loup et son comportement, le comprenait. Certe le loup a faim, surtout pendant les hivers très froids et attaque les troupeaux. Pas étonnant que les paysans de l'Auxois ou du Gévaudan savaient très bien que les bêtes qui ont fait des massacres n'étaient pas des loups ( ou du moins loups normaux ) alors que les bourgeois des villes rigolaient en lisant la presse ...

 C'est gênant pour l'éleveur de perdre une bête. Ca devait l'être bien plus il y a 200 ans que maintenant, où un éleveur qui perdait une bête ne pouvait qu'espérer toucher un petit quelque chose des autorités. Je suis certain qu'il y a beaucoup de fraudes d'ailleurs aujourd'hui. 

Je suis certain que l'on pourrait trouver un moyen de faire revivre le loup "" correctement "" en France dont la géographie convient parfaitement à l'animal. Certains pays y arrivent bien ( il me semble que depuis très longtemps l'Italie s'en sort pas trop mal malgré quelques bergers, bien qu'ils s'y fassent ). 

De plus, l'absence du loup pose aussi des problèmes de surpopulation chez certains animaux, dont le sanglier ( ah mais les chasseurs ne seraient pas heureux si on diminue le quota qu'ils peuvent tuer! )

Je plains le berger qui perd des bêtes, mais je plains le loup aussi ...

It is (and this is something germany was heavily lobbying for) independent from the governments and free to decide whatever it thinks is right. About the irresponsible lender, it is give-and take. If i were offered a loan for a car, even though I did not have the money for it, and I accepted it, it is of course the banks fault for not carefully checking my financial background, but overall, I still am the one to blame, because i knew i could not afford it. 

As for you articles, I think it is rightful to say that it is not right to point the finger at only one party, but still, being financially irresponsible does not come from a joint currency, however, this irresponsibly is amplified by the problems a single currency without compensation mechanisms bears. For the solidarity, the problem is just that literally nobody wants to give money away without having a major say on what is done with that money - same thing the other way, if someone is forced to give you money, you dont want that other person to decide what to do with ""your"" money. Another problem i see is that, even though there were mechanisms in place that would punish financial irresponsibility or misadministration in general did not have the power to actually punish someone or correct anything. I still think that some of the reforms are necessary and needed, but what is currently done to get to a budget surplus is way to hasted and abrupt. Of course it is basically impossible to have a no-bailout clause, but this is what everyone agreed on in the beginning and on this agreement, everyone has to pay the price. The other thing about this is that, if there is actually a bailout clause in place, budget mismanagement will be punished very late, at the point where a government cant pay its loans even though it gets favorable rates that are granted because countries that are better of economically are guaranteeing for these debts.",null,0,null,1422651253,null,0,false,0,co63mvk,null,t3_2u7kqp,null,t1_co63mvk,null,t1_co62hyq,null,null,null,1424300742,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Der Begriff ist so aktuell wie eh und je.
&gt;Der Begriff Recht hat doch nur einen Sinn, wenn es eine übergeordnete Instanz gäbe, die dieses auch durchsetzten könnte.

Nein, zunächst einmal legt das Völkerrecht fest, in welchen Rahmen international gehandelt wird. Natürlich gibt es da mehrere Probleme. Zum einen ist das Völkerrecht vielfach eine Art Gewohnheitsrecht, es gibt keine verbindliche schriftliche Fixierung. Dadurch sind auch Änderungen schwierig, da die einen sie anerkennen, die anderen nicht. Und zu guter Letzt ist das Fehlen einer Schiedsinstanz ein Problem, siehe die unterschiedlichen Ansichten zur Krim.

&gt;Ist doch nur Recht-des-Stärkeren (herbei-legitimierter Kriegsgrund), also Willkür und was zum Schreiben für Journalisten ?

Nein. Das Völkerrecht ist durchaus wirksam. Klare Verstöße dagegen werden ja auch durchaus geahndet. Es hat ja auch einen Grund, warum die USA sich vor dem Irakkrieg so vor der UNO abgekaspert haben, sie wollten ""im Recht"" sein. (Rückblickend hätte ein nachträgliches Referendum der Iraker gereicht, die Mehrheit hätten die USA bekommen.)

The allied occupying forces wanted ordinary Germans to understand the horrific price which others had paid for Germany's 'Third Reich'. 

These people, local residents, knew that there was a labour camp and must have known that horrible things were happening there, but they turned a blind eye to it and said nothing. They didn't want to know much about it. By doing that, they are in some way responsible for what happened there. They couldn't really be punished for it (although the allies did impose a form of  collective punishment on the German people through rationing and expulsions), but they had to be confronted with what Nazism actually stood for and the consequences of comfortable silence in the face of evil.

You can see a similar today with some South Africans. There is a tendency among some whites to say that apartheid 'wasn't all that bad' or that 'its reverse racism now', opinions, which stem from a failure to acknowledge that the Apartheid system was criminal in nature, depended on violence for its existence and provided for a small minority at the expense of a majority.

By contrast, the attitude that developed in Germany after the war (instigated by the allies, but really developed by Germans artists, teachers, intellectuals) is reflected throughout the entire nation. In Berlin, for example, it is difficult to walk down a street and not see a plaque or memorial to victims of the Nazis. The idea that the entire German nation bears responsibility for what happened during WWII is instilled in everyone. I have never met a German who has tried to play down or minimize what happened for the sake of their pride or their ancestors pride.

It is precisely because the allies confronted ordinary Germans with the consequences of their actions, that Germany has a fairly healthy relationship with its past.

Furthermore, if Greece is allowed to fail it could have knock-on effects for investments in Italy and Spain, which could then draw the entire Euro-zone into another recession.

What is going on right now is not so much about what Greece deserves and not. At the end of the day the money has been wasted and crushing Greece will do nothing to bring it back. No, this little circus is a power struggle between different people within Europe's political sphere. In the end they will come up with some fancy programs which distributes the cost of rebuilding the Greek economy across all of Europe, but it is politically infeasible to simply say that that is what they are doing, so instead we get this little show here.

Something like this was waiting to happen. The Eastern and southern nations in Europe have much weaker economies than the north-west, so if we are to have a common market those differences will eventually have to come down. Expect increased migration from the east to the west as a consequence. If we let Greece fail, its people will move over here in search for a better life.

Screw the laws, justice, education, economy, ecology, whatever, just blackmail the Serbs and start spreading the hate and fear, add a bit of righteous vengeance, diaspora votes and BAM insta win elections.

More ICBMs doesn't even given you a 'military edge'. It gives you a pile of wasted money. 

And you have to ask: if we know they've been testing these systems, in public, then what is going on in the 'black projects'? The SR-71 Blackbird and B-2 Spirit Bomber (to name just two) emerged complete, when needed, out of the dark. The same thing happened during the Cuban Missile Crisis when the US exposed its' ability to take reconnaissance photography over the isle without anyone knowing.

After the Boeing YAL-1 platform it's been rather obvious the path the US has taken to developing. And it leaves a sour taste in my mouth: on one hand we're protected from the threat of ICBMS (at least hypothetically) but on the other hand any action that would require such counter-measures would undoubtably leave a lot of people dead.

Because that's not what this crisis showed to us. We saw Merkel and Schauble dominating and pushing the Eurogroup as the center of decision making in financial matters ABOVE the ECB and European Parliament. Essentially they (the CDU and as an extension of them the European People's Party) by keeping Barroso as president of the European Comission they castrated it (Barroso is often called the Euro-clown in Greek newspapers, it's not just the Germans that get flack). Now the Eurogroup that is essentially dominated by EPP members is pulling the shots telling us that the only way forward is Austerity (which is a name that appeals to Conservative voters as it makes it sound like detention for bad kids. In fact it means selling off anything worthy owned by the state to the friends of the local elites. See Russia post Soviet collapse). Jean-Claude Juncker (president and finance minister of the biggest money laundering country in Europe) is the new president of the Comission (elected by plurality not majority) and another usual target of Greek media and Greek people. Why is that? Because he is another one of the establishment that wants to destroy our country. I am not saying that they woke up one day and thought 'let's destroy these poor bastards'. No, their political beliefs and involvement with huge financial interests and corruption make them dangerous leaders. This is not the Europe we signed up for.

On the other hand for example Martin Schulz is a very decent politician and every time I hear him talk he makes a lot of sense. If you had that guy as Chancellor believe me that we would have no problems at all ;)

As for 'the path your people have chosen' - that is a gross misunderstanding. We've been fighting for financing of science and education for years, there are thousands of Greek scientists abroad. We are fighting for tourism that doesn't destroy and that still allows us to be DECENT. We didn't choose to be a semi-colony. We can practically not make cars (even your car factories are subsidized), we don't have coal deposits and established industry. We have shipping (not taxed!!!), agriculture, tourism and we used to have banking/trade.

null,false,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,null,"You can't really compare USD values from one year to the next, because it depends on the exchange value. Besides, 2012 is a *really* bad year to base your calculations on. That was the year of the private sector haircut and the second bailout, and it was also a year when Greece still had to repay many of the bonds it had issued itself, many of those presumably from the time when its interest rates had exploded.

The bulk of Greece's debt as it is now (more than half), and even more so in the future, are [the EFSF loans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Financial_Stability_Facility#Greek_bailout). The interest rate for those is 1% plus what it costs the EFSF itself to borrow. Their average maturity is more than [32 years](http://www.efsf.europa.eu/about/operations/index.htm), through the 2040s to the early 2050s.  
You'd have to go through all their bond issues to calculate that cost, but as a facility that is collectively backed by all members, you can expect those rates to be appropriately low.  
There are also bilateral loans from the first bailout, those Euribor (effectively zero) plus 0.5%. What's with the ECB and other national central banks is under this agreement to return any profits (i.e., over self-cost) back to Greece, which presumably is something they wouldn't want to touch in the negotiations, or with the IMF or the private sector, which can't realistically be changed.

So, the biggest lender is the EFSF. No repayment in the foreseeable future, and very low interest rates. Cutting that in half might reduce Greek interest costs by another half percent or so GDP, give or take, and save them repayment further down the line. Since the EFSF is backed collectively, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish etc. governments would now have to explain to their voters why they had to relief the Greeks from debt they wouldn't have to repay in the foreseeable future, and refund the EFSF, when those countries are paying more of their GDP on debt and have more than their own fair share of problems right now.  
Reducing the principal of the bilateral loans with their yet lower rates would have practically no effect at all.

The highest interests to the official sector loans are payed to the IMF, good luck renegotiating that.

So, again, something is needed that has an immediate effect, but a debt reduction, as far as European countries have any influence over it, would hardly have a noticeable effect until in another generation or so from now.

Because Greece would rather stay in a recession for a decade than do their best to repay you?

Friends don't loan friends money, that solves a symptom, friends help fix the problem...which solves the problem. The EU pushing austerity and giving out impossible loans was a way to distract the populace of wealthy Europe from the distress of its own financial system until it could become more stable.

 In the end the debt WILL be eaten by taxpayers, in the same way that people getting shitty bank loans for their house were subsidized by everyone who didn't. It's the plan not because it's right or fair, but because it'll work (Germany+ can afford it), and the alternative (break up of EZ) is a worse economic choice than eating the debt of a tiny country.

Until there is a power structure that innately cares for the EU as a whole, the individuals will act in their own favor (because that's how they're chosen).

--

This saddens me. Imagine if those funds were vertically integrated. Europe could spend less and get *much, much* more. ~~The United States runs a yearly defense budget of ~$600b -- European NATO members spend 1/3 more; all while having *far less*.~~ A vertically integrated EU-wide defense force would be more capable, provide more defense, field better weaponry, and is cheaper!

--

The United States has (about) 3x as many fighters, 10x as many carriers, 50x as many logistics assets, etc. All while Europe spends more for less. 


----


**EDIT:** Apparently the quoted segment in question was referring to the totality of NATO's budget. The wording was, in my opinion, far too vague. Sorry I did not fact-check those numbers; this post was an imprecise 'on the phone short-break' general musing. 

--

The fact still stands; vertical integration -- institutionalized single EU-wide command structure -- is cheaper, more flexible, and more capable as a function of fiscal input. Especially in eliminating redundancy and procurement of weapons systems; more-so in the case of large(er) projects such as aircraft carriers that can often be too expensive for a single country to procure, maintain, arm, and utilize. So far the Americans (and soon, perhaps, the Brits) have only *really* been able to utilize aircraft carriers to any extent in the age of 'modern war' (Yes, France does have the *Charles de Gaulle* but its rarely deployed, one isn't enough for a rotational structure, and it's 37,085 tonnes).

The standard method for sizing tires combines millimeters for tread width but uses inches for rim diameter.[22] Tire inflation for a typical passenger car is 30 psi (pounds per square inch), which is also given in its metric equivalent (207 kPa, or Kilopascals). In lighting, light bulbs use eighths of an inch for bulb diameter and full inches for fluorescent tube lengths, while the socket is always in millimeters (for example, the standard ""medium Edison screw"" is E26). On recently introduced Christmas lights, however, millimeters are often used with small globe-shaped bulbs (G30 and G40), and with miniature LED sets, where the standard T1¾ (7⁄32-inch tube) ones are sometimes called M5 (5 mm miniature; not to be confused with M5 thread)",null,0,null,1422654534,null,0,false,0,co65ob0,null,t3_2u752i,null,t1_co65ob0,null,t1_co64fv7,null,null,null,1424299792,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Die ganze Angelegenheit ist recht unübersichtlich mit drei (vier?) kriegsführenden Fraktionen im Irak.

&gt; Was ich hier für sehr wichtig halte, ist darauf zu achten, dass die Lieferungen so gestaltet werden, dass die Kurden nicht hinterher genügend Waffen für einen eventuellen Bürgerkrieg gegen die Zentralregierung haben.

Ich glaube da ist es recht egal was man macht. In der Region gibt es mehr als genug verfügbare Waffen und was entscheidet ist wohl, ob man ihren Preis bezahlen kann. In der Beziehung läuft es für die Kurden wohl ganz gut laut Artikel ;)

&gt; Andererseits wird doch im Zuge der Krimkrise dauernd auf das Selbstbestimmungsrecht verwiesen. Sollen sich die Kurden doch schnell per Abstimmung unabhängig erklären und alles ist in Butter ;)

Würde ich prinzipiell genau so sehen. Statt das verschiedene Ethnien oder Glaubensgruppen sich gegenseitig unterdrücken, soll doch jeder in seinen Grenzen wohnen in denen er sich seinem Nachbarn gegenüber friedlich Verhalten kann.

Ca veut rien dire les placements a la francaise. Bayrou a appelé a voter contre Sarkozy mais c'est la présidentielle. Ca n'a pas empeché les alliances aux législatives. Les mêmes alliances depuis le RPR cela dit.

&gt; Ils votent avec l'UMP 80% du temps...

&gt; Au Parlement européen le PS fait pareil. Remarque le PS est de droite aussi. 

A bah tu dis que le PS est de droite mais le centre est au centre? Donc le centre est a la gauche du ps? 

&gt; Tu as parlé de centre dans la droite conservatrice. Le centre avait son candidat à la présidence de la commission donc c'est faux. 

J'ai dit que je les placait dans la droite conservatrice idéologiquement, pas aux élections du président candidat voyons. Idéologiquement si je peux abuser du terme un peu, ils votent comme l'UMP en majorité, au parlement Européen et Francais. C'est pour moi bonnet blanc et blanc bonnet. 

* addendum suffit de voir leur programme sur leur site que j'ai visité rapidement : 1er item, redressement des finances publiques. C'est un peu le theme du post !

Yeah, I can see how some people say that. The Greek government had to be elected and then they did fucked up shit to get re-elected. In reterospect, Greek people shouldn't have voted that way. But the British government does the *exact same thing* on a regular basis.

OK. Not *exactly*, but the news here right now is full of David Cameron saying ""we must give tax cuts to everyone"". We are 6 months away from our elections. It's like telling a 6-year-old that they will get presents if only they believe in Santa Claus.

The thing is: it will work. It's what the same party (the Tories) did for ten years straight between 1980 and 1990. The British voters *will vote* for that, *even though* it's so stupid that a child could see through it.

And every democracy you look at does the same thing. The Greeks got caught out because the the money ran out because they had a smaller budget.

The Tories will give a tax cut, hold an election, and then raise taxes again after they get elected. And in 5 years, they will say: ""hey, we all earned a tax cut.""

I really, really, find it hard to blame the people of Greece after seeing how *my* country votes.

Sir Winston Churchill said: ""democracy is the worst form of government known to man - apart from all the other ones we've tried.""

So maybe, actually, the Greeks *are* to blame. Especially those troublemakers in Athens, with their philosophy and their debate and their voting on things.

Meanwhile mainly French and German banks are leveraged to ridiculous ratios, much higher than American banks in 2008. They lent cheap money (like for what, 5% before the crisis?) to a country they should knew won't be able to pay off such debt.

I think it would be sensible for you, personally. At the cost of harming your country, overall. That decision is one that only you can take. If you choose to leave Greece, it could have negative consequences for your country in the short term. But possibly in the long term it may have a positive benefit.

It's known as [brain drain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital_flight) and the UK lost a lot of talented people to the USA in the 1960s. We still do. The government has been forced to invest more in keeping people here.

BTW, I hate to be picky (especially since you speak far better English than I shall ever speak Greek) but you mean ""emmigration"" (leaving a country) rather than immigration (arriving in the country one is talking about).

Try again with *none*. It's a misconception brought to you by xenophobic ranting of populist media. 



It doesn't work in the real world, no statistics or formal authority has ever observed such trends. Noone in contact with eastern-european imigrants has ever observed such trends. 


The logic itself has a lot of loopholes. 


Do you think Polish workers will volunteer to work for less money? 


If this person can find no work at his homeland, where he's a native speaker and knows the laws, how come he can do so in a foreign land?


Why can't a dutchman cover his rent with the same salary a Polish worker could (They both live in the Netherlands, since the Pole is 'stealing his job')?


How come a person is stupid enough to let himself get exploited is able to immigrate at all? Do you know how complex the process of starting a new life is?


How do they work 'legally' below the minimal wage, if the minimal wage is the lowest possible wage a person can work legally for?


How come they can work 'illegally' at all, in a country with 10x better regulated laws?

Capital controls, but that's hardly a good option and will cause even more trouble unless it's a truly extreme emergency situation.

&gt; Unless there is an agreement in EU level for the Greek debt things are not going to get better for Greece.

I don't agree with that. The interest rates on the share of Greek debt EU members can do anything about are already extremely low, and maturity dates are far in the future. Lowering/extending those again (hardly anyone noticed the first time) would have preciously little effect in the short or even medium term when it's needed.  
There's also an agreement to return all profits the ECB and national central banks make on payments on the debt they hold back to Greece, but that was on condition of the bailout agreements and today's events will cause problems here. 

The remaining private sector held bonds are practically untouchable after the ""restructuring"" back in 2012, and good luck negotiating a debt relief with the IMF.

No, what would be needed is something that has an effect in the short term, like an EU investment program via the EIB. That would still be problematic for other members who aren't exactly doing great right now, and which, thanks to those very low interest rates, actually have to pay a larger proportion of their GDP on interest than Greece, but at least it would have an effect.

&gt; If they can't stand then let them go.

You don't want that. That would be Very Bad™.

&gt; If they default do they take our debts with them too?

No, they owe stuff to other banks, institutions and account holders. Besides, what they still have is only about 3% of Greece's outstanding debt, much less than what they owe the Greek state, or the ECB for that matter.

&gt; Let them default. Not like anyone has any savings in them anyway.

Un luogo del genere risulta essere a) deserto b) un'ottima scusa per esercitare atti di vandalismo e piangere su quel che resta di milioni di investimenti.

Se preferisci farti legare ad una sedia elettrica piuttosto che prendere in mano un libro, in un centro come quello che hai descritto usufruiresti del wifi ""aggratis"", ti faresti qualche peso per pomparti il fisicaccio e sfotteresti quei lupi solitari che partecipano all'incontro sui poeti francesi, per dire.

Let me give you an example. I moved away from Greece (due to crisis) and moved to the US. So the gov decided to make a law that said that you get taxed even if you have no income in Greece (don't ask why - because they can) supposedly because if you say you have no income and you are alive then you must have SOME income (troika logic). In any case, many Greeks are abroad like me, no income we protested (my father called the greek tax office etc and many others I know) and they came out in the parliament and said that 'the law will not count for citizens that live abroad'. Great right? Well, I do my forms and of course they tell me to pay 500 euros! I call them and they say 'the minister didn't sign the amendment, don't worry about it we'll fix it soon'. I call again a couple days later 'same story ... it will be ok', (understand at this point the tax office is telling me not to pay what they sent me to pay). After about a month they say 'it was not possible to fix this issue, you will have to pay the tax'. Just one example I have hundreds if you want to hear stories of 'everyday madness'.

No, same deal. Any assets (like contracts for loan repayments) would get distributed to the various parties they'd owe money to.

&gt; I agree that we need an EU investment program.

Yeah, this is why I believe Syriza's plan to found a national investment bank is a good idea. Other countries have such an institution already, and any EU investment program would probably go through them.

&gt; Capital controls are almost impossible to impose and might do even more harm than good.

Yeah, they're truly a last resort. The problem is that, as things are going, there's a real risk that capital flight will become uncontrollable. And even while Greece is still technically solvent and within the financial assistance program, at some point the ECB would have no choice but to shut off liquidity.  
That's one reason why today's events were bad. If I had money in Greece, I would be very nervous, to say the least.

&gt; As for our debt, I don't think it's viable in the long term.

Don't let the percentage GDP figure confuse you. [This](https://www.google.de/search?q=inurl%3A6e5532c0-a310-11e4-ac1c-00144feab7de+site%3Aft.com) article explains it quite well. *If* Greece returns to growth, it's manageable, and as I said in the short term any reductions that EU countries have an influence over would have little effect. Hence my support for an investment program.

In my view, the ideal situation would be to start a currency Union of Germany, Netherlands, Austria, Luxemburg, Finland and the Baltics perhaps. 

Those are somewhat equal by design and culture economies, that could actually easily become a fiscal Union as well. Those countries would also integrate generally much quicker, perhaps we could act as the example, and slowly add new countries along the way.

&gt; they would be forced to live without any ""fresh"" money, gonna be hard running an export deficit. I assume it would be a lot worse than the current situation.

Indeed, shortages of import goods would be a problem. They could basically only hold a trade balance or a trade surplus, and would become very self sufficient. 

It shows how important it is that countries subsidize and protect their agriculture, at least Greece will have food. As most European nations can eat sufficient without foreign imports. (less diverse obviously)

Many people were benefiting or just afraid of 'the system collapsing'. Now there are more people that just don't give a fuck if it collapses. And then you see all the europeans doing the same 'oh what if the system collapses what then?'. Does anyone honestly honestly think that the political and economic system in any european country works for the benefit of the citizen and not of the rich?

&gt;Luckily the EU isn't merely based on ideals, or it would have collapsed years ago. The EU has failed to encourage European prosperity for the past 6 years. 

That's not an ideal. The ideal is peace, but the goal is cash. America has only really started to recover, so it's not just the EU's fault though I do feel that their austerity policies have made things worse. 

&gt;They might yes.

&gt;On the other hand, if we forgive Greek debt, we should also forgive the debt of Portugal, and that of Belgium, and that of Ireland.

&gt;Hell, we will forgive our own debt. I am not paying for debts if others aren't either, we could just cut all foreign held debt. 

You and I just have different views here. Forgiving the debts of nations like Greece and Spain will, in the long run, give more money back to Germany and France (or whichever EU nation you're from). I'm not saying that the governments forgive all debts, but relief would ultimately net more money for everyone. 

Honestly, I don't even have a 

&gt;We're talking about governments (taxpayers) holding the Greek debt. Banks don't hold a lot anymore. 

I was conflating the banks with the governments. The debt-holders is a better term. My bad. Still, my point stands. The people in the upper-echelons of government are every bit as stubborn and well-educated. 

&gt;Syriza is trying to destroy and ravage through Europe, that is it's primary goal. It wants to inflict as many damage as possible on others. 

They've made it pretty clear that they do not want a Grexit. They're trying to scare Europe, not break it. 

&gt;I just hope Greece leaves finally and goes away on their own. I see any form of Greece staying as a failure at this point.

My advice? Don't be so extreme here. If it works then it works. 

I'm very much for a progressive tax, but if a flat tax was passed, all loopholes closed, and the government ultimately took in more tax revenue then I'd be happy (assuming it didn't all go towards the military and went towards programs that actually help people) because it did something positive. 

Ideology is important, but pragmatism needs to take over sometimes. Greece will bow the the EU pressures if SYRIZA feels like they cannot win, but SYRIZA looks to be playing the game better right now. 

The Greeks fucked up in the past, but a cautious belief that SYRIZA can stop the corruption that lead Greece down the path it's on now should be observed.

Driving is far and away the best way to avoid the tourist traps and visit some really interesting places. One thing to beware of is that the further off the beaten track you get, the less likely it is people will speak English (and in certain regions, even finding Spanish can be tricky).

Here is what I would do:

After recuperating in Madrid for a day or two, drive up to León to see [this cathedral](https://www.google.com/search?q=leon+catedral&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RwbMVMizNIKboQTboYDICA&amp;ved=0CB8QsAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=677), eat [morcilla de león](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morcilla_de_Le%C3%B3n), walk by the river and just poke around. Then, like a half hour down the road is Astorga, a cute little town with medieval walls and ten zillion bakeries. Everyone will tell you to try the mantecadas, but I didn't think they were that great.

From there, head toward Ourense. The [Río Sil](https://www.google.com/search?q=rio+sil&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FAnMVMf9K8_moASftYBw&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=677) is near there, and the region is a world heritage site for having something like the the most concentrated number of monasteries in the world. Some of the bigger ones have been converted into awesome hotels. This is also a famous wine region (known as the Ribeira Sacra) where the albariño and mencía wines are produced. There is also some great hiking to be had, as well as natural hot springs (*balneario* in Spanish). The best ones are right outside the city of Ourense.

Santiago is only like an hour or so away from Ourense. I wrote a post in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/spain/comments/2nio8t/three_days_in_santiago_de_campostela/) a while back about some stuff you can do/eat there.

And then the coast is super close. [Baiona](https://www.google.com/search?q=baiona&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mA3MVJKvHdCyogTqi4KwBw&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAw&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=677) is a cool town with a castle and stuff, and up in the hills somewhere nearby there are some 10,000 year old petroglyphs (I might be exaggerating on the age). From Vigo and Bueu (I think?) you can take a ferry to the [Islas Cies](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1366&amp;bih=677&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=islas+cies&amp;oq=islas+cies&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l4j0i5j0i24l5.4987.6846.0.7219.10.9.0.1.1.0.139.988.3j6.9.0.msedr...0...1c.1.61.img..0.10.986.4PBUiqQQ250) and the [Isla de Ons](https://www.google.com/search?q=isla+de+ons&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=677&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZA7MVPn9BYuZoQTa44DYBg&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ). You can even camp there if you want! Cangas and Combarro are nice beach towns, and I've heard good things about Fisterre, Muros and Muxia as well. For the north coast, you have (other than the big city of A Coruña) Foz and Ribadeo, and of course the [Praia As Catedrais](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1366&amp;bih=677&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=Praia+As+Catedrais&amp;oq=Praia+As+Catedrais&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i24.358077.358077.0.358431.1.1.0.0.0.0.118.118.0j1.1.0.msedr...0...1c.1.61.img..0.1.117.1dhmezCLsc0) with the famous sea stacks. The north coast isn't as populated as the Atlantic, and there are a couple national parks up there as well. Fragas do Eume is a cool rainforest-like place. 

If you have time, think about checking out the city of Lugo, which has the world's only complete Roman wall (great place for jogging) and some of the best tapas ever (¿guiso de jabalí? ¿¡gratis!?).

Some miscellaneous things you might want to look into: [Castro culture ruins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castros_in_Spain), [pazos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazo), and Casas Rurales. Casas rurales are fully equipped ""country houses"" for rent and are a great alternative to AirBnB or hostels if you'd rather avoid the cities. Cheaper than you'd think, too.

As for the Camino, I never walked it (unless you count pushing past pilgrims on my way to the bus) so I can't really help you there.

The reason they were happy (and relatively successful) working 4 hours a day(which is a vast understatement, because realistically if you're talking about hunter-gatherers here, they were constantly 'working', just not in our modern sense of the word), was because in their frame of reference, that was what everyone else was doing.

People like this guy are the reason whole societies are mentally stuck in the dark ages and human progress is so slow.

These are the things he actually believes. He expresses them without shame. He actually thinks that his grasp on history is better than that of a person whose statements related to European history he didn't even grasp. He didn't just  deliberately ignore references, he didn't even catch them. He isn't mentally capable of processing them. 

Notice how he aggressively attacks others while not being able to formulate simple falsifiable arguments nor to respond coherently to the points made against him. He is (literally) unreasonable. This is nothing he can be blamed for, he simply can't rationally respond to what was said due to a severe lack of education and a high level of indoctrination. This is the kind of person we need to learn to deal with. 

This is why Eastern Europe needs stronger support and why we need EU-wide educational standards. Just imagine directly living together with people like this. That is what intellectuals in his country have to deal with every day. It's no surprise we can't make progress like that. People like this actually exist and they are everywhere.

To be fair any little guy should get taxed along with the rich. The state provides services to its people. Those services need to be payed for by the people.

It is a shame that the rich feel no obligation to pay their taxes (Lagarde list) but in a society where everybody lies on their taxes there are not consquences. If everyone does it no one really has the moral right to get upset at somebody else doing it. And with that there is no way to shame people into paying their taxes. At the moment they are not taxing anybody efficiently. No Greek person seems to feel responsible for paying their taxes.

Do you think that attitude would change if the debt of Greece were to be forgiven? I fear that this would continue and 20 years down the road Greece would be in a situation no unlike it is today.

null,false,selfhatingyank,UNSA,"""Troll"" is an ugly word. I consider myself a ""devil's advocate.""",null,"&gt; Is Germany like opposite land or something for the far left?

Europe has become opposite-land in many respects lately, not just here:

-The continent that was synonymous with ""big government"" for decades has now been a fierce champion of cutting public spending, while the US has prodded them (unsuccessfully) to spend more.

-The left has become the land of nostalgics and traditionalists, while the right (esp. the centre-right) has been responsible for many of the most radical changes to the European social contract. 

-Most of the change in the past 5 years has been rightward, i.e. more in favor of big business and less in favor of the welfare state. This completely belies the right's ""conservative"" orientation.

-In a number of countries, the political demographics are the reverse of the US: Elderly, rural, and poor whites are often devout far-left voters in Northern Sweden, the Alentejo of Portugal, the South of France, and rural areas of the Czech Republic. In many countries, younger generations are more pro-America and pro-Capitalism than their parents (Scandinavia, Italy, and Germany come to mind) or conversely are more racist and more extreme-right (France).

-Many far-left parties openly collaborate with and support the far-right or vice versa. SYRIZA has been praised by Marie Le Pen, is in a coalition government with the right-wing AN.EL, and has alleged ties to Russian fascist Dugin.

-The political spectrum is now a horseshoe, with far-left and far-right parties having similar policies towards Russia, the USA, social safety nets, and often the EU. Although Europe remains to the left of the US, it is far less so than it was in the past and paradoxically the US Republican Party is often closer to the ""Socialist"" parties than it is to the ""far-right"" (while Hollande would be considered a mainstream leftist in the US, he is much closer to the GOP than Marine Le Pen is on economic issues at least).",null,0,null,1422662596,null,0,false,0,co6a4aj,null,t3_2u8flf,null,t1_co6a4aj,null,t1_co6771u,null,null,null,1424297717,null,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6,null

null,false,WorldLeader,UNSA,United States of America,null,"While those may be good specific examples, I think that the overall concerns are more about the idea that the US doesn't act with Germany's best interests at heart. There is also the fact that many people resent ""Americanization"" because they prefer to keep their traditional culture. 

It's a common theme throughout history - countries who would rather become isolationist when the future starts looking cloudy. It is rooted in the flawed idea that your culture is superior, and therefore would be stronger if you could bunker up and reinforce traditional values. The US was a prime example of this during the first half the 20th Century - Americans by and large wanted no part of Europe's wars, and isolationism was a very powerful theme. It wasn't until the US was attacked directly (The Lusitania and Pearl Harbor) that popular opinion swung towards favoring intervention. In both wars though, tons of propaganda had to be used to get citizens to favor war. 

To me, these modern German protesters are feeling the same type of feeling, namely that Germany would be able to be much more successful if they were not aligned with US foreign policy, and secondly that ""traditional German culture"" is superior to the commercialism and superficiality of American culture. It goes without saying that they'd also be against mass immigration, since this would also run counter to their ideal scenario. Basically, if they were left alone and allowed to mind their own business, they'd be a much stronger society. 

As an American myself, I don't mind at all if other countries want to protest against us or object to our ""cultural exports"". It's their right entirely to object and make their voices heard.

I don't think that they are correct, however. The US is a bit like the Borg - we eat up everyone and steal their culture, parts of their languages, and invade/destroy/rebuild countries that do not comply with our demands. It's certainly not a pretty picture of you focus on the negative aspects only. On the positive side though, the US has proven that a nation of immigrants can become inordinately more powerful than any mono-cultural nation. There are still very large issues with inequality and, as the recent protests have shown, large questions still open about race. But I firmly believe that the future will be won by nations that integrate more ideas and talent from all corners of the world, instead of limiting cultural influences domestically.

tl;dr: The main issue is trust, not just policy (since enacted policy is still unknown).

It's theater, talk, populism. Not even of the constructive kind, but mostly aimed along ideological lines and at the Greek audience. Talk is cheap. I have a hard time trusting politicians, and this man looks like a politician through and through. There's the hope that Syriza will lead to a positive change in Europe, that money is freed up for investment, that reforms take place, that inefficiencies are reduced and tax loopholes closed. But so far I've only seen antagonism, blame shifting, deliberately polarizing language, and few actions that were there I disagree with. So I trust him even less than the governments who agreed to ""austerity"".

Like /u/visvis says above ^[[link]](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2u82sp/is_this_the_kind_of_union_we_want/co6187y?context=2):  
&gt; Spending money is not an automatic cure to economic crisis and Keynesianism is far from proven. It may or may not work. The IMF and EU were lending Greece money at well below-market rates, which means it's reasonable to demand that risks for them are being minimized. Spending money is not a guarantee to economic growth, while spending less than you earn is a guarantee that you can keep paying off your loans.

Tossing around the term ""austerity"" is useless. It all depends on the specifics, on where investments are made and where cuts are made.

I also don't refer to as ""them"", because I'm not an insane bigot that developed some us vs them mentality.

&gt;This very same video you provided here is a perfect example of what a century of Russian rule does to a country. This man is a leftover of the Russian influence. Russia was and still is an agressive country that always relied on other contries' resources and manpower, they will not rest until they get their empire back,

This is what that guy actually wrote. Notice how he projects everything negative in his life unto the people he chose to hate. It's a typical rationalization response. It's what led the Nazis to hate Jews. This guy has been successfully indoctrinated.

&gt; look at what they're doing at Ukraine right now, do you actually believe that they are there to protect civillians? Or even worse that there are no russians there at all? 

Notice how he utilizes a thought terminating false dilemma to push his insane views. There is no rationality left. He is here to bash Russia. Russia is what he hates. Nothing I could ever say would *ever* convince him. He is lost.

Like the people whom he started banding together with in this thread to form an anti-Russian mob, he has completely ignored all arguments made. And I'm pretty certain that he - the same way like the others - not only ignored what was said, he didn't even get it. Just look at his question: It starts with ""do you actually believe"" and follows up with nonsense completely unrelated to anything that was said. He actually believes those questions are reasonable.

&gt;First they will finish off Ukraine, then they will go for Belarus and then they will go for Poland and us Baltic States, you will mark my words

He completely ignored all points made. He is not intellectually capable nor willing to interpret Russia's behaviour from a historical context and to process the underlying causes for behaviours. He doesn't see Russians as humans. He sees them as ""Russians"". This is what nationalism does to you.

170 Grad Celsius ist eine gute Temperatur. Dadurch bleibt's außen knusprig und innen saftig.  
  
Achte aber bei dem Frittierfett auf viele einfach &amp; mehrfach ungesättigte Fettsäuren.  
Das steigert den Genuss ungemein.

&gt; Sind krokodile laut ? wegen laermbelastigung...

Nein, nur die Kinder, die du verfüttern wirst.  
""Warum Kinder?"" wirst du jetzt fragen.

Kinder haben viele Vorteile:

* sie sind leicht zu ködern, z.B. mit Süßigkeiten

* sie sind noch nicht so stark mit Umweltgiften belastet

* sie wehren sich nicht so sehr

&gt; Anabolika ja oder nein ?

Definitiv nein.  
Dein Krokodil wird zwar in frischem Zustand massig aussehen, allerdings wird das fertige Endprodukt sehr verschrumpelt sein.  
Niemand mag verschrumpeltes Fleisch.

Für natürlichen Muskelzuwachs empfehle ich Spielmöglichkeiten, z.B. Nahrung am Seil aufhängen (siehe oben für Nahrungsvorschlag), damit dein Krokodil springen muss.

Krokodilschenkel sind köstlich.

Very much so, actually, particularly when the regulations under which they operate were broken, as has been revealed to have been the case. 

&gt; Also, German intelligence were caught intercepting and recording phone calls of top US officials but this does not seem to be discussed all that often either.

The ""scandal"" here was that those calls hadn't been recorded straight away, but that they asked the head of BND ""we caught this, what should we do?"" before flagging the recordings for deletion. The recordings themselves were ""by-catch"" when Clinton/Kerry were on the phone while flying over an area in the Middle East where BND was targeting terrorists who were using the same spectrum.

That is not true. Russia spends more in GDP terms than the US on defense. Many European powers rely more on their defense industries than the US does in GDP terms. They might not all be consumed at home but they export far more in GDP terms than the US. 

How exactly did the US force Russia to invade Ukraine because Ukraine was considering expanding trade with the EU? What about the fact that Russia banned the import of Moldovan wine and threatened to deport all Moldovans working in Russia if it continued trade negotiations with the EU? It seems like there is a common bully. Yet countries in the ""US' sphere"" are free to trade with whoever they want. Many EU countries trade extensively with Cuba, yet the US still maintains its embargo (for now). They are clearly not afraid of a US invasion should they continue, because Canada and the NL are Cuba's largest trading partners. I am fairly certain the US is not afraid of either. If you can not see the fact the US is the bully then you are willfully blind. 

That aside, why not look at non-US sources. Look at the UN vote condemning Russia's actions. The only nations supporting it are a collection of dictatorships or banana republics. Maybe you think the US causes every problem, that is fine. But the almost unanimous condemnation of Russia's actions seem to suggest the US is not the aggressor here. 

&gt;It failed to come into conflict with Iran

So the US is an all powerful warmongering state, yet it can not start a war with Iran?

&gt;Why every time I mention the shit US has done in the middle east, people just shut down and don't take that into consideration?

Because this is about Russia. In topics about North Korea people would say the Serbian genocide against Bosnians was off topic too, even if they are both violent.

&gt;Do you really think US government is doing good and it helped people in Afghanistan, Iraq, Tunis, Libya, Syria etc. Do you think all that war was necessary and justified?

The US did not lead all of these conflicts, but some yes, and some no. Afghanistan, yes. They harbored terrorist factions that attacked the US on several occasions. Iraq, no. But I do think that the no-fly zones imposed in the 90s were more than warranted. I went on vacation to the Kurdish area of Iraq, and the people there are eternally grateful that the US stopped Saddam from dropping chemical weapons on them. So I would say they were certainly helped. Libya was largely a European led operation. It took the UK PM and French President going to Washington to convince the US to get involved in Libya. Russia is more to blame in Syria than the US. Russia has blocked any UN action there. Not to mention the US did not cause the civil war there. If you think it did you need to do far more research. 

So do I think all that war was necessary, no. Do I think it was all justified, no. Do I think some of it was, yes. ",null,0,null,1422663650,null,0,false,0,co6annd,null,t3_2u79zg,null,t1_co6annd,null,t1_co6a0w0,null,null,null,1424297466,null,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5,null

Consequently as will you, unless you're implying your spoken words are the incarnation of truth, which would be the example of being biased. :)

&gt; That's not an ideal. The ideal is peace, but the goal is cash. America has only really started to recover, so it's not just the EU's fault though I do feel that their austerity policies have made things worse. 

Peace is not the only ideal, cash not the only goal. Again, we failed on the cash part. The Euro has made us increasinly poorer, in some cases even poorer than we where in 1999.

&gt; You and I just have different views here. Forgiving the debts of nations like Greece and Spain will, in the long run, give more money back to Germany and France (or whichever EU nation you're from). I'm not saying that the governments forgive all debts, but relief would ultimately net more money for everyone. 

You forgot that these debts are held by Dutch/German pension funds, banks, firms, governments even. 

If we would cut the debts of Spain, the Netherlands would be bankrupt. How exactly will this make the situation any better?

Debt is not some evil thing, it's a circle. Debts are held by funds and banks, funds and banks are held by the ""the people"". 

Cutting in these debts will result in a complete crash of Europe, beyond which no Union would be possible anymore. 
 
&gt; I was conflating the banks with the governments. The debt-holders is a better term. My bad. Still, my point stands. The people in the upper-echelons of government are every bit as stubborn and well-educated. 

Ooh well, the Greeks hold 4000 Euro from me. Mr Dijsselbloem is representing us, a country that has lend 4000 Euro per working citizen to Greece, and is sick of paying their bills while poverty is increasing massively here. 

&gt; They've made it pretty clear that they do not want a Grexit. They're trying to scare Europe, not break it. 

The Eurozone has also made it pretty clear that they will not give anymore money if they do not meet the terms. 

And I indeed expect from my politicians to not give a dime anymore. 

&gt; My advice? Don't be so extreme here. If it works then it works.

It's not like this is anything new. The Greek crisis has been going on for years, and if we stay weak it will still be trending topic in 10 years from now, and they have repeatedly tried to blame the Germans for their misery in utterly distasteful manners. They have no notion of responsibility, integrity or anything related. I have little admiration for Greece, and less than zero trust if you don't mind. 

&gt; I'm very much for a progressive tax, but if a flat tax was passed, all loopholes closed, and the government ultimately took in more tax revenue then I'd be happy

If one could actually make Greeks pay tax, that alone would be a breakthrough, regardless of the rate. 

The problem with corrupt, nepotist, clientilist oligarchic states is that it's a chronic disease. There's no known cure, and any progress would take years, decades most likely. 

&gt; Ideology is important, but pragmatism needs to take over sometimes. Greece will bow the the EU pressures if SYRIZA feels like they cannot win, but SYRIZA looks to be playing the game better right now. 

If it is a Grexit they want, then they are playing it better.

&gt; The Greeks fucked up in the past, but a cautious belief that SYRIZA can stop the corruption that lead Greece down the path it's on now should be observed.

They still do, they where given a chance, they don't want it and are merely interested in blaming Germany for their flaws. 

Generally I would say a Union with such people is impossible, so why be a pragmatist? It would undermine the whole Union.

null,false,The_Rat_Cook,UNSA,United States of America,null,"&gt;If we would cut the debts of Spain, the Netherlands would be bankrupt. How exactly will this make the situation any better?

&gt;Debt is not some evil thing, it's a circle. Debts are held by funds and banks, funds and banks are held by the ""the people"".

&gt;Cutting in these debts will result in a complete crash of Europe, beyond which no Union would be possible anymore. 

It helps because austerity is crushing the economies of Greece. Reduce the debt and lengthen out the payments and Greece has a bit more money to spend on jobs and other things which help give people jobs. The new influx of wealth in Greece helps them to pay their debts. At this rate, Greece would just continue to be crushed.

That's crazy simplified, but Greece needs a break or else Greece will break. 

&gt;Ooh well, the Greeks hold 4000 Euro from me. Mr Dijsselbloem is representing us, a country that has lend 4000 Euro per working citizen to Greece, and is sick of paying their bills while poverty is increasing massively here. 

Honestly, I feel you there. I come from a family that is not at all wealthy. If one of my parents lost their job, especially my dad, then they'd be fucked. I get the feelings of ""Well, fuck them! We need the help right now,"" but those feelings are only going to make things worse. Things seem to be getting heated over there, but making the Greeks suffer will not help. Instead, allowing the Greeks to prosper will do something, not only for them but for you as well. Greece will be able to contribute, and that's better than letting them go. 

&gt;If one could actually make Greeks pay tax, that alone would be a breakthrough, regardless of the rate.

&gt;The problem with corrupt, nepotist, clientilist oligarchic states is that it's a chronic disease. There's no known cure, and any progress would take years, decades most likely. 

That's a legitimate concern, but SYRIZA might just be the beginning of the cure. However, they need to show the people that they've done something and kept their promises. As I said, watching SYRIZA carefully trusting them but not too far is the most reasonable course of action right now. 

&gt;They still do, they where given a chance, they don't want it and are merely interested in blaming Germany for their flaws. 

Syriza is an opportunity for something new. The Greeks have given power to a new party that is not one of the two that has ruled since the inception of the modern Greek state. 

&gt;Generally I would say a Union with such people is impossible, so why be a pragmatist? It would undermine the whole Union.

&gt;I wouldn't oppose cutting in debt, just not inside the Eurozone. Also, we shouldn't give them a dime anymore. We have got enough problems ourselves, we don't need theirs too.

A Grexit will only make things worse for many years to come. Instead, supporting a government that is working to change things and is trying to get things done will create a better result in a shorter time. 

The EU's economy getting fucked would fuck the U.S. too. It wouldn't be as bad, but the progress America has made recently would fall to the wayside.

This is due to relatively low wages in Germany making our products competitive. We turned the story around and said the problem is high wages in the south. So we forced upon them ""reforms"" to press wages and prices down which would improve their current account. But that does not work since wages are sticky when trying to lower them and take a long time to start falling accross the board. Also firms run into liquidity problems and go bankrupt which doesn't lower wages but creates mass unemployment. 

Increasing wages in Germany on the other hand don't have that ""stickiness"" problem. It would make German products less competitive in the rest of Europe but would increase the domestic market. So it is much easier to achieve the much needed closing of the competitiveness gap by making Germans richer than Greeks and Portugese poorer. But that would increase inflation in Germany to something like 5 percent for several years and neither large party in Germany will accept that. But this would be my solution. It's not healthy to sell stuff to people that they can't afford and also give them the loans for it through our capital exports. We need to lower our trade surplus and instead of bleeding the south making Germans employees richer is easier and smarter.

No new loans are needed. Greece is running a primary surplus (as in ex paying interest on old debt and one time non recurring items their budget is doing fine). All we need to do is not get paid interest for a few years and allow some breathing space. 

Non of this will happen, though. Greece will likely be forced out of the euro we will lose all our loans. Germans will remain underpaid and the German media will keep on writing that ""Lohnzurückhaltung"" (no or low wage increases) and ""Sparpolitik"" (saving policy German new speak for austerity) are ""alternativlos"" (without alternative). We will fuck up Greece even more instead of admitting a wrongheaded policy.

Imagine you inherit some farm land, you have to either sell or pay tax on it. However, you cannot sell because it's the crisis and people are just not looking to buy. You have the option to sell for 1/3 of what you feel it's worth but you don't want to do this because it's ridiculous and you know your ancestors worked their arse off all their life on/for this land. What do you do? Oh by the way, you're unemployed.

If it is a property in a city, rents have fallen by 50% and there is great instability in rent payments. If your tenants can't pay any more, it is extremely expensive and takes years to evict them. In many cases you're initially reluctant to do this out of solidarity to the previously good tenants who lost their jobs.

In many cases, owning property is a net loss (and btw, there are other taxes linked to property ownership, not just ENFIA). It is one more punishment for those who did things right:  

Did you save money and invested in property? - Taxed  
Did you have a good job? - Taxed  
Did you work all your life to get a pension and relax? - Taxed  
Did you run a healthy business? - You're probably tax-evading, so we're gonna tax you a bit more to make sure, also we'll check your books for the slightest omission to fine you  
Did you tax-evade by working with money ""under the table""? - Not taxed  
Did you tax-evade by employing unregistered workers? - Not checked, there is a shortage of inspectors which became worse after restructuring the public sector

null,false,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,null,"&gt;  So we give them money to pay off interest on the debt from the loans that we gave them in the first place.

Not quite. Greece doesn't pay all that much in interests, despite the high principal. But there are still some outstanding bonds that aren't owned by the official sector (e.g., about 3% of Greece's debt that is held by Greek banks, about 1% held by foreign banks, and a mixed bag of 20-ish % owned by who-knows-who). Actually, Greece has issued new ones last year.

The bilateral loans from the first bailout and the EFSF loans from the second neither cost much interest nor will they mature in the coming years. IMF is a different matter, though.

You can read more about this, in ascending order of complexity and detail, [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11372369/Three-myths-about-Greeces-enormous-debt-mountain.html), [here](https://www.google.de/search?q=inurl%3A6e5532c0-a310-11e4-ac1c-00144feab7de+site%3Aft.com) or [here](http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1551-greek-choices-after-the-elections/) (last one suggests possible solutions).

&gt;  Essentially all we've done is transferred Greek debt from the Greek &amp; other EU banking institutions to the EU taxpayer.

Initially they still had a sizeable primary deficit, and a decent proportion of the funds had to be used by the Greek government to keep their banks afloat, but essentially, yes, the idea was to prevent a cascading collapse of the banking sector. This seems sensible.

&gt; Considering now that we own all the debt (well most of it anyway), and would lose all that money were Greece to default, would it not be better to simply write off some of the debt or restructure it in a way such that it is payable over a longer period of time.

We did the restructuring thing already, and I don't mean the private sector haircut. Interest rates have been lowered and maturity dates have been extended significantly. The average maturity dates of the EFSF loans, which make up the bulk of the debt, is more than 32 years with no repayment anytime soon. The interest rates on those is EFSF's own cost plus one percent, that of the bilateral loans is Euribor's three month rate (about a twentieth of a percent at the moment) plus half a percent. And, on condition of sticking to the bailout agreement, all profits the ECB and the national central banks make on any Greek bonds they hold (remember how the ECB bought them for cents to the euro when the crisis was at its peak?) are given back to Greece.

Those are the loans we (Europeans) have any say over, already restructured. Interest rates for the IMF loans are a bit higher, but we can't do anything about those. The remaining post-restructuring bonds still held by the private sector are pretty much untouchable.

Instead of reducing the debt, which would have only a tiny effect in the short term, we need to come up with a program that works right away, like an EU investment program (that should *not* be payed out of the research budget).",null,0,null,1422666364,null,0,false,0,co6bzp6,null,t3_2u7ky9,null,t1_co6bzp6,null,t1_co68pby,null,null,null,1424296843,null,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9,null

Whether Syriza is making the right choice or not, it is the choice that they were voted for by the Greek people, and I respect them for sticking to their word so far. I say this because in Greece there was A LOT of suspicion regarding Syriza going back on its promises as soon as it rose to power and, if we look at the rapid way things are unfolding, the one thing we can't fault them for is inaction and passivity.

I'm not an economist, but I really believe that sticking to the current program is *not* the correct decision. If the program was ever to produce any meaningful results, it would have only been a long time in the future, after the Greek working force would have been bled dry for money, and as a young Greek aspiring to enter the working force soon, this is not a future I would like. And it's not just the financial deprivation, it's outright refusal of employment. Unemployment has skyrocketed and everyone here in Greece is afraid for their jobs. If you've ever been in this situation, you know how it feels, so I won't try to sentimentalize with some clumsy description, but it's not pretty; it created an atmosphere of instability and it certainly was the primary factor which aggravated the Greek people.

Ignoring the difficulties you obviously have with not only writing (""do you believe would Russia"") and you're obvious condescension,it would be akin to bouncing a stone off a brick wall. Any mention of Russia reeling from a complete economic and political collapse, electing one man, who after gaining total control, not seen since before the aforementioned collapse (of an obviously authoritarian regime), decided that any action taken by those sovereign nations, that the Russian government does not agree with, is tantamount to an attack on Russia.

People typically dont do that though. Before Russia annexed Crimea every US wrong over the past 20 years would be brought into every conversation. I have no doubt it will go back to that again as soon as this blows over with Russia. But bringing up Russia in topics about Iraq would be just as off topic. 

&gt;In the end, all the people say is 'Ooops'.

I could not agree more. It cost serious lives in Iraq, it has cost serious lives in the US military, it has cost well over $1 trillion, with a T, dollars. I would love a flat out ""the Iraq war was wrong, it was based on bad intelligence, and the intelligence we did have was recklessly relied upon."" Unfortunately the closest I think we will get is Obama's condemnation in his campaign. 

That said, just because the US completely fucked up there does not mean Russia is no fucking up now. If you do not want to take the US' word, there are plenty of other countries in the world that seem to think so. 

&gt;Not to mentioned it indirectly created some of the worst 'organizations' (ISIS). Yes, it did. Whole region is a mess directly from US actions.

You can make the argument that the instability in Iraq is a contributing factor, but ISIS was not ""created"" by it. You can make the argument that the civil war in Syria, very strongly backed by Russia, has played a much larger role in the emergence of ISIS. 

&gt;US actions are not represented in media, they are not tried nor discussed.

how do you figure? The media has been reporting on the war in Iraq for well over a decade. The human, financial, and geopolitical costs have been very heavily covered. Russia is trying to censor coverage at home by enacting laws that ban foreign ownership of media, despite using its foreign media arms to push its narrative in other countries.

You are obviously not responding in a rational manner if you ignore everything you said and insist on your opinions which I have already contradicted.

&gt;it just doesn't jive with your world view, and thus you've concluded that it's irrational. 

I already explained quite explicitly why you are irrational. You dishonestly misrepresenting what I said and making things up is just more evidence of you being irrational.

&gt; What, in particular, about my comment made you deem it so?

Reread what I wrote.

Maybe if you would actually respond thoroughly to my comments the same way I am responding to yours, you wouldn't have to ask that question.


&gt; I could continue to elaborate on my response to your initial question:

Do it.

&gt;Ignoring the difficulties you obviously have with not only writing (""do you believe would Russia"") 

Mhm, delicious personal attacks of no relevance to the conversation.

This is what you understand under ""rational conversation"" and ""elaborating""?

&gt;and you're obvious condescension,it would be akin to bouncing a stone off a brick wall. 

The irony of that incoherent line riddled with grammar mistakes following your hilarious attempt to criticize my writing is mind-boggling. I can't even...

You are just kidding, right? I mean, you aren't actually serious about anything you write here, right? This is just a bad joke?

&gt;Any mention of Russia reeling from a complete economic and political collapse, electing one man, who after gaining total control, not seen since before the aforementioned collapse (of an obviously authoritarian regime), decided that any action taken by those sovereign nations, that the Russian government does not agree with, is tantamount to an attack on Russia. 

I asked you to respond to what I said.

I asked you to answer my question.

Nothing you just said there was a response to what I said nor an answer to my question. It was yet another  incoherent rant about Russia. 

&gt;I could continue, but I have a sneaking suspicion that it will fall on deaf ears.

There is nothing to ""continue"". You first of all need to start.

Here: Russia's behaviour is a consequence of the Great Game, simple as that. 

Respond to that.

Then, after doing that, here: Why do you believe would Russia behave the way it does with the US/NATO out of Europe?

If you mean this, i think it all depends on the politic system of the country. There are some countries having a system more in favor of one-party governments (like the UK previously) and others (like the german) who will have a coalition no matter what. 

So, just a quick overview over the (major) parties of my country (Sorted by political orientation, left to right): We have 

* The Linke (Left party, the successor of the party that governed the GDR) 
* The Greens (Green party, ecological-left)
* The Pirates (Pirate party, left-liberal, they dont have much success anyhow)
* The SPD (Socialdemocratic party, socialdemocratic, a liitle more leftish than the cdu)
* The CDU (Christ-democratic union, conservative)
* The FDP (Free democrats, Liberal)
* The Afd (The alternative for germany, right-populist)
* The Npd (National demoractic party, far right, neo-nazi party, not a major party, barely got into the parliament of one federal state) 

Parties with representatives in the german national parliament are (ordered by strength) CDU, SPD, Linke, Greens.
Coalitions we had on national basis: CDU/FDP; SPD/FDP; SPD/Greens; CDU/SPD. The coalitions in the parliaments of the federal states are quite different, mostly they are lead by SPD or CDU, but we also have some from the left party and one state is governed by the green party. So by the nature of the fact that coalitions are needed, politicians (or better: their parties) are forced to negotiate with the other parties. Of course, the politicians will prefer to stick to their own view, but they will also adapt the negioted view in other areas if needed. Sometimes, they even are happy that they can blame the coalition partner on that they didnt implement some parts of their program (which they sometimes did not intend to implement earlier, it just gives votes). Also, there are some coalition formats which are either very unlikely (Linke with CDU, SPD with afd), some coalitions which are not tolerated (The SPD might have a majority in the national parliament if it grouped up with the Greens and the Left, but nobody wants to go into a coalition with the left party on the national level because they are seen as irresponsible, in some states, this combination is real though; The CDU does not want to go into a coalition with the Afd even though the adf is pretty much the cdu from 30 years ago, politics-wise) and some that have never actually been practiced in the national parliament but might become true in the near future (CDU/Greens; SPD/FDP/Greens). The parties usually have a ""traditional"" coalition partner, but they are often also willing to switch theirs. Sometimes, you will see single party members opposing the compromise (happened with the policy towards the euro crisis, there are politicians who are completely against giving money to any other country), but they are usually such a little majority that they dont even matter, they also have no way to filibuster laws.",null,0,null,1422668811,null,0,false,0,co6d6hv,null,t3_2u9921,null,t1_co6d6hv,null,t3_2u9921,null,null,null,1424296289,null,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5,null

&gt;Imagine you inherit some farm land, you have to either sell or pay tax on it. However, you cannot sell because it's the crisis and people are just not looking to buy. You have the option to sell for 1/3 of what you feel it's worth but you don't want to do this because it's ridiculous and you know your ancestors worked their arse off all their life on/for this land. What do you do? Oh by the way, you're unemployed.
If it is a property in a city, rents have fallen by 50% and there is great instability in rent payments. If your tenants can't pay any more, it is extremely expensive and takes years to evict them. In many cases you're initially reluctant to do this out of solidarity to the previously good tenants who lost their jobs.
&gt;
In many cases, owning property is a net loss (and btw, there are other taxes linked to property ownership, not just ENFIA). It is one more punishment for those who did things right:

&gt;Did you save money and invested in property? - Taxed  
Did you have a good job? - Taxed  
Did you work all your life to get a pension and relax? - Taxed  
Did you run a healthy business? - You're probably tax-evading, so we're gonna tax you a bit more to make sure, also we'll check your books for the slightest omission to fine you  
Did you tax-evade by working with money ""under the table""? - Not taxed

This is also for future reference for me in case I want to cite you.

People tend to claim ""idiots like that don't exist"" and ""show me evidence of people reacting that way"" in other discussions.

You remember all these comments written by  ""conspiracy nutjobs"" claiming the NSA programs are about total global surveillance and used for spying in every way including industrial espionage?   
Remember all these comments written by ""conspiracy nutjobs"" claiming that that US is systematically kidnapping and torturing people in secret black sites all around the world?

It really strikes me as interesting in the way that the Scandinavian languages are different from English, in relation to definite and indefinite nouns.
In English and Danish they would both in the singular indefinite form go like: ""a plane"" or ""a car"", whereas in the definite form, as in ""the car"", they put the ""a/the"" part behind the noun. 
If we did it the same way in English then ""Did you buy the car?"" would be ""Did you buy car-a? and ""Did you catch the plane?"" would be ""Did you catch plane-a?"". 

I'm assuming it would work the same way with ""an"" as in ""an education"", where ""What was the education that you got?"" would be ""What was education-an that you got?"".

In the early 1990s __""...it became fashionable to portray Greece as an awkward partner or indeed a black sheep in the European Union"" because of its economic mismanagement and frequently non-cooperative spirit in political matters__. Greek admission to the euro zone indicates that after a long process of democratization and economic reforms Greece has become - in economic and political terms - a country like any other member of the European Union. Greece is finally coming home to Europe.  

[...]

&gt; In 1992, when the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated to establish the legal framework for EMU, Greece was the country with the greatest adjustment problems among the EU member countries. Inflation and fiscal deficits were well above the EU average, while the Greek economy grew more slowly than that of the EU(see Figures 1-3). This difficult economic situation was the consequence of very expansionary economic policies during the 1980s. Public consumption was increased by a policy of deficit spending. The expansionary fiscal policy was supplemented by a loose monetary policy leading to high inflation and a steady depreciation of the drachma. Wages were automatically adjusted to price increases through an indexation scheme, which led to further pressures on prices and devaluations of the drachma. The increasing current account deficits could only be financed by means of EU transfers and foreign loans

[...]

&gt; __There could still be a loss of reputation for the ECB if financial markets believe that the ECB is going to accommodate an expansionary policy by a member country or - as a lender of last resort - is going to bailout a member country to contain a financial crisis.__ The question then is whether Greece is likely to trigger such a crisis. Put differently, is the current process of convergence sustainable? __While Greece is in accordance with the convergence criteria, the analysis above made it clear that the EMU requirements have been met only very recently and are partly due to temporary influences.__ Therefore the question remains whether this situation is sustainable.


It's clear that some people could see the current situation coming (although the paper is actually quite optimistic, as it was expecting Greece to embrace reform like Ireland did).",null,0,null,1422669635,null,0,1422670217,0,co6dkoh,null,t3_2u9ih8,null,t1_co6dkoh,null,t3_2u9ih8,null,null,null,1424295973,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

Unlike Mr Varoufakis I only studied my minor subject in economics but I will attempt to maybe try and read into some of what he meant, 

Right now Greek debt is simply unpayable in it's current state without continuing the austerity/cutback/shrinking economy cycle we see presently, 

Minus the debt repayment grece has a current account surplus...So it is a viable state and if it is allowed to grow instead of continuing the debt payment/economic contracction cycle they have some hope of paying it back.

I expect at the very least Greece to say to the IMF, ""ditch the penalizing interest, the eurozone is in deflation, your central bank is lending money at 0%, yet you charge us 5%, this is not the recovery you envisioned when we started this process with the troika. the growth never materialized so lets talk about 0% interest on our debt for a start or at least index it in line with eurozone inflation so you are not making a profit through our sinking ship""  


The other thing is as he points out, they just came to power in a coalition they simply need a few weeks to bring together their proposals and come to the EU with a solution that works best for everyone, they must involve their coalition partners in this so expecting something solid a few days after an election is quite frankly crazy and feeding the media info now they later have to change to please their partners is like blood in the shark filled waters

That's the thing, I don't believe that people calling the shots thought for one second that the reason for going in was for WMD. 
The sole reason for going in was to create new market for private and military contractors. It turned out exactly as planned. It is naive to think that intelligence failed. It didn't, they knew exactly what they were doing, and what they were doing was monstrous.
Intelligence agencies of that caliber, failling? C'mon, do you really think it was about WMD?
&gt; groups that planned and carried out 9/11 were very much operating out of Afghanistan

Group of people that planned and carried out 9/11 all wear CIA badge on their chest. It's so obvious that it happened to raise public support for wars I mentioned. Haven't you thought about it for a bit? Questioned it? Whole situation is really obvious. Maybe it's hard to think that way from your standpoint, but for an outsider, it's clear what happened. Without muslim 'demonization' they couldn't have started anything. One more thing, what a coincidence that during Taliban rule there were no opium production, but now with US in charge, heroin trade is thriving. 
&gt; You can make the argument that the instability in Iraq is a contributing factor, but ISIS was not ""created"" by it

It is created with the help of Saudis and Turkey, both close allies to US. And how it happens to be that when Iraq is in question, US sends thousands of troops, but when real threat is at stake, US does practically nothing (aside from couple airstrikes for show)
&gt; That said, just because the US completely fucked up there does not mean Russia is no fucking up now.

That's true, it doesn't. But US agenda is not to resolve Ukrainian crisis, it's to hurt Russia as much as it can in hope to divide and destroy it. While in the end, it could fuck everything up, and just say 'Ooops' again. 

&gt; The media has been reporting on the war in Iraq for well over a decade.

Because why not?

Well you have to ask ""would lower rates improve economic growth in these states and make the eurozone more balanced?, or if one country is paying interest on a loan to the ECB who is the other party to the trade receiving it?'"", lastly I don't honestly believe those rates were set with stagnant to negative eurozone growth and inflation in mind, in a deflating economy even the lowest rates become unfeasible as you are constantly paying back debt with a smaller and smaller pie.

Ladies and Gentlemen!


What can be considered the principle of parliamentary work?


Politics in the sense of social responsibility means, and that should
be assumed, that is, not to put too fine a point on it, in consideration
of the situation, we are currently in. I can sum up the points of view of
my political opinion in just a few words:


First of all, the self-conception under the assumption, secondly, and
that is what we owe our voters, thirdly, the concentrated inclusion
as centrepiece of a futuristic party program.


Who did then, and that should once be stated unequivocally in front of 
this parliament. Even the economical progress did itself in every manner,
that can't be controverted by anyone, without failing to recognize, that
in Brussels, in London the opinion is held, that the SPD-FDP coalition - 
and, ladies and gentlemen, why not?


And where did we at the end of the day, without heating up the situation
unnecessarily, there comrades and ladies and gentlemen lies the rub.
Please be mindful of the educational policy. Who was it, for 15 years,
and we foresee, that no one can claim, as back then would have, that is
really not how it's done.


I always pointed out, that the questions of environmental protection,
and I stick to it, where would we be, where would our credibility be?
One thing is clear, and there is no doubt about it, whoever forgets that,
did not understand the order of the voter.


The loan and price policy emanates from the premise, that the medium-term
financial planning, and in the field of the tax reform that was always 
of crucial importance.


My ... my ... my ladies and gentlemen, social equity as serious obligation,
we don't want to forget, outside across the country, here and today the
questions are asked and therewith I want to finish. In the end, who would
deny it?

If a bank can't fail then what stops a bank from just risking everything on the roulette of shitty debts every time? All our banks (yours too) were exposed in 2007. We didn't learn from that. Remember the haircut in Cyprus? See the Greek banks now? What do you think the Spanish or Italian banks will be like tomorrow? The German later? It's a bubble all over again and we are inflating it again.

The EU should guarantee people's deposits up to a point, and take control of failing banks. Right now having money in Greek banks is like having no money. Everybody is moving their money to Germany. Do you see why this is a problem? We need stability, and the only way to do it is for the EU to step up and do some deep changes to GUARANTEE Greek banks. Even better just unify European banks - why don't we have this already ? (it's been voted years ago but never implemented).

Don't always buy the 'one way' narrative that the Conservatives try to feed you. I know it's hard but there are deep problems in the system. Greece is not a freak accident.

&gt;He said Greece distanced itself from the EU texts because it wasn’t properly consulted, not because it didn’t like the content.

Mais en résumé: OUI, fonce! 

Les deux sont très bien.  The theory of everything c'est émouvant et j'ai pleuré/eu les larmes aux yeux mais étant donné le sujet c'est assez normal je pense; ça cherche à émouvoir bien sûr mais sans en faire trop non plus, c'est pas la grosse comédie romantique à l'américaine que je craignais (j'avais dû voir la bande annonce américaine parce que c'est l'impression que ça m'avait donné la première fois que j'ai entendu parler du film: je l'avais aussitôt rangé mentalement dans la case ""nope nope nope""). C'est intelligemment fait tout en étant grand public (ceux qui y vont pour l'aspect scientifique risquent forcément d'être déçus mais cet aspect n'est pas du tout mis de côté non plus). L'acteur est bluffant, mais tout le casting l'est. 

The imitation game je viens de le voir et j'ai adoré. Je pense que j'ai moins besoin de le défendre ? Déjà  sur le papier il donne envie et il ne déçoit pas. (J'avais aperçu des critiques négatives, mais sans les lire vraiment avant de le voir, donc faudrait que je retourne voir ce qu'ils lui reprochent parce que je vois mal... peut-être des réserves sur l'aspect historique? Je ne suis pas assez calée pour me prononcer là-dessus. Oh et j'ai une petite réserve aussi mais vraiment pas grand chose  - je ne la dévoile pas pour pas vous influencer). 

Ah oui pour The theory of everything, j'ai dit que c'était émouvant ,et ça l'est, mais au final c'est un feel good movie au bon sens du terme: ne craignez pas d'en ressortir déprimé.

null,false,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,null,"I'm not sure how well ""partisan"" translates from the US system to one with proportional presentation. When you look at the origin of your (in practice) two party system, then it emerged naturally from the regional system you mentioned when combined with FPTP. ""I don't like the leading candidate, let's band together and support a common candidate to prevent him."" Your parties are essentially election campaign clubs that are as much about opposing the opponent as they are about supporting their own candidate. When you only have two parties, then the other party's failure to achieve something is a win for you, your opponent's success is a loss. The Obama presidency has provided many opportunities to observe this concept in action.

I'll mostly talk about Germany here, but it's similar in other countries with comparable systems. Here, parties are constantly active from the local to the federal level. They have a large full-time staff. Members meet regularly. There can be internal disagreement between party wings.

You vote for a person, we vote for a party (well... mixed member proportional representation on the federal level uses two votes, and there are a plethora of state- and municipal election systems, but let's keep it simple). MPs in principle are free in their mandate, but in the end, they rely on their party to give them a good position on the party list, so party discipline is usually adhered to. You can see this as a form of partisanship.   
Parties define their policies and principles in their party program, which usually remains valid over long periods of time. Before elections, they agree on an election program, which defines their goals for the coming legislative period and gives more concrete answers to current policy issues than the party program could. For day to day politics and current events, parties have committees and spokespeople who are specialised on the policy area in question. Representatives almost always vote along with whatever their party's specialists on the subject have decided is right.

Since it's rare to impossible for a single party to win the majority on its own, there almost always has to be a governing coalition between two or more parties. For this, parties negotiate with potential coalition parties after an election, and try to agree on a coalition contract that sets the policy goals for the legislative period. This requires finding compromises (or horse trading, depending on how you look at it). Unforeseen events can't be covered, so the negotiations are more or less constant and may or may not go well -- coalitions can break apart, even if this is rare -- but they (almost always) vote as one block. 

Anyway, partisanship. The contrarian strategy is less viable here, because voters have other options than only your own party if you make another look bad. This doesn't mean it doesn't happen, just that generally there tends to be an emphasis on highlighting your own solution over merely trying to invalidate the alternative. Depending on where they are on the spectrum, you might also have to form a coalition with that party in the future, or already are in one on the state level.  
Another factor is that the established parties have a common interest to remain at least somewhat constructive to not to disenfranchise voters from mainstream politics altogether. FPTP systems inherently are more stable than proportional systems. Within the latter, populist parties can slowly build support and don't have to win outright to grow into a problem.

Finally, there's an interesting phenomenon with coalitions. Eventually they will end and the still-partners will compete for votes, so while they have to try to be constructive for the coalition to be successful, they still have to distinguish themselves from their partner(s).

&gt; Immigration

&gt;- A reduction in legal immigration to France from the current 200,000 a year to 10,000.

&gt;- A ban on automatic immigration rights to join a spouse or family member residing legally in France.

&gt;- An end to the European Schengen Area, which gives free cross-border movement, and reinstatement of border checks.

&gt;- A toughening of the requirements to get French citizenship, which the FN says should not be automatic, while insisting that applicants demonstrate a strong commitment to France and its language.

&gt;- Zero tolerance of illegal immigration and an end to illegal immigrants’ rights to remain in France if they have been in the country for a given period.

&gt;- Priority to be given to French citizens over foreigners for jobs and for social housing.

&gt;- Banning dual nationality for non-Europeans, which would particularly affect citizens of former French colonies in Africa.

&gt;EU

&gt; - The FN would seek to re-negotiate all EU treaties in order to claw back national sovereignty.

&gt; - Take back full control of the country’s frontiers.

&gt;- Establish primacy of national laws over European laws.

&gt;- Leave the Euro.

&gt;- Create a French agricultural policy and leave the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for which France is, in fact, a net beneficiary.

null,false,iisno1uno,LITH,Lithuania,null,"Story in short: two Lithuanian dudes upload a pic of them kissing on the FB, and share it in some photo contest or whatever. Loads of hateful comments appear. Lithuanian LGBT organization screenshots these comments, asks public prosecutor to start prosecution against these commentators. Prosecutor says no, LGBT org asks court to order the prosecutor to start the prosecution, court says no too.

Now, what actually the court said:

&gt;A person who uploads a picture of two men kissing should be aware that such an eccentric behaviour does not contribute towards mutual understanding in society, and does not promote tolerance.

Also last quote of the article is right too:

&gt;A person who publishes private information on a social network, practices the freedom of expression, has to take into account the fact that freedom is inseparable from the obligation to respect other people’s beliefs and traditions.

Now me playing devil's advocate:

* These were only some of the arguments the court used, the main was: ""Though comments are hateful and insulting and use swearing they do not break a law"". 

* The court uses those arguments I quoted in the beginning of my post in a sense of ""well, there are people who might not like what you do, but you cannot lock them up because of that"". Tho the wording the court used is truly odd for this day and age.

* The judge who ruled it is only pre-trial judge, she does not actually rule actual criminal cases. She does, however, allow or deny the right for police to bug someone or something like that, so there's that.

* After the appeal the proper court will have a hearing, and I believe everything will be ok, cause though it is true, most of the comments were just ""Fucking faggots, you are ugly"", ""piece of shit, you are disabled"" and so on, there were like 3 comments that said ""we/you should burn/beat them"", also 5-10 more ""to burn ones like these"" which are actually not an invitation to do something bad to them, but more like hypothetical scenario (don't know if I'm explaining this right, it's called imperative I guess in English, but it's the one that is not directed at anyone specifically). However, as I said, few comments were indeed direct invitation to do something bad to them, and that's why I believe the appeal will be successful. 

edit: oh and btw, the main mistake LGBT org made was to screenshot all of those hateful comments which clearly do not break any law together with those few that were suggesting to cause harm, and thus do break the law, and presented them to the prosecutor by saying: ""look, people are mean on the internet"". If they were to present those few comments separately, and asked to start prosecution case against them specifically, I think public prosecutor would have had no chance to say no.

Because Russia antagonizes its neighbors even when it gets what it wants. Sweden and Finland are not in NATO, have repeatedly said they don't want to join NATO, said Russia is a neighbor they want to stay on good terms with, etc. So what does Russia do? [Why harass those very neighbors, of course](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/finland-feeling-vulnerable-amid-russian-provocations/2014/11/23/defc5a90-69b2-11e4-bafd-6598192a448d_story.html). It has been doing the same for countries that it considers ""theirs"" for many many years. Even ""friends"" are not immune now, as Belarus and Kazakhstan are finding out.

It's no different than when the USSR tried to bully Turkey into getting some special deal for Bosporus straight access even though there was already an international treaty it had agreed to. The only time they stopped is when Turkey had enough of that shit and joined NATO.

There's a very good reason almost every neighboring country of Russia is antagonistic towards it: History shows that they have a good reason to. Russia would be pulling the exact same shit with or without NATO nearby. They would just be using France/Germany/UK as the enemy instead of US/NATO. Russia's foreign policy is unfortunately still stuck in the 19th century for a variety of reasons and because of that, it only sees two kinds of countries: pawns and adversaries. Adversaries are seen as too big to mess with, and NATO lets former pawns turn into adversaries.

null,false,Amanoo,NETH,The Netherlands,null,"Seems somewhat inaccurate to me. 

Before the introduction, they do describe the following: Ui, uien, eeuwen, 
only vowels [-n is not pronounced]. I feel that not pronouncing the -n in the multiple form -en is mostly Hollands. In a lot of other regions, people will pronounce it. I can still remember my grandma saying things like ""mie skatt'n"" instead of ""mijn schatten"", or ""kiek'n"" instead of ""kijken"". As a Twent (an Almeloër, to be precise), she'd swallow the -e- instead of the -n. Which letters are pronounced, and which are not, really depends on the region. In proper Dutch, swallowing letters doesn't happen. You're supposed to pronounce everything, although some combinations of letters are diphthongs, which have a different pronunciation from the individual letters that form them. For example, ui is pronounced as a diphthong, and not as u-i. 

Also the mention of these three dialect families might imply that there aren't a lot of dialects. There are many subfamilies, which in turn have many different dialects. Even Twents is considered a dialect family by many, and every city in the region has its own dialect that's different from the others. Not to mention the fast differences between Limburgs, Fries, Vlaams, Twents and Hollands. And within a of them are many subfamilies. Amsterdams sounds very different from Rotterdams. 

Although when they describe Dutch in the introduction, they do say that there is a lot of variety, and that Hollands is the dialect most other dialects seem to converge to. That much seems accurate. Dialects are still somewhat of a big deal, especially in the east. They're not as much a big deal as they used to be, as people who speak pure dialects become rarer, but some people still feel rather strongly about them. And there are still a number of people who can speak such thick dialects that people from other regions can't understand them.

null,false,endlessrepeat,null,null,null,"When a reflexive verb already has a direct object (like ""Gesicht""), then the reflexive pronoun must be dative--otherwise, it is accusative. For example:  
*Ich wasche mir das Gesicht.* = ""I'm washing my face.""  
""Das Gesicht"" is the direct object because it's what's being washed, so it's in the accusative case, and thus the reflexive pronoun must be in the dative case (""mir"" instead of ""mich"")--simply because that's how German works. You cannot have a sentence like ""Ich wasche mich das Gesicht"" because it's essentially having two different direct objects for one verb, which you can't do. It would be analogous to saying ""I pet my cat my dog"" in English.

More examples:  
*Ich wasche mich.* = ""I'm washing myself.""  
In this sentence, there's no direct object besides yourself, so the reflexive pronoun is in the accusative case (""mich,"" not ""mir""). Reflexive verbs, which take accusative or dative reflexive pronouns, are different from verbs that always take dative (which aren't reflexive). For example, there is nothing reflexive about the sentence ""Er hilft mir."" The verb ""helfen"" just happens to always require the dative case for its object.  
The verb ""waschen,"" unlike ""helfen,"" does *not* always require the dative case. You would say ""Ich wasche mein Auto,"" not ""Ich wasche meinem Auto."" But when ""waschen"" (or any other appropriate verb) is used *reflexively*, the reflexive pronoun is accusative if there is no other direct object present (""Ich wasche mich""), or it's dative if there is a direct object that isn't referring back to the subject (""Ich wasche mir das Gesicht"").",null,0,null,1422688671,null,0,false,0,co6lag7,null,t3_2u9qel,null,t1_co6lag7,null,t1_co6gliz,null,null,null,1424292272,null,7,false,German,t5_2qq51,7,null

La relation froid =&gt; rhume provient de la **réaction immunitaire à une infection**, qui est d'augmenter la température interne de référence du corps, pour en limiter le développement. Cette augmentation de la température de référence induit une **hypothermie** temporaire, qui est responsable se la sensation de froid.

Donc pour résumer:

1. J’attrape une infection
2. L'infection se propage dans le corps durant quelques jours
3. Le système immunitaire finit par réagir et augmente la température de référence corporelle
4. L'hypothalamus fait le nécessaire pour déclencher les mécanismes pour réchauffer le corps (frissons, vasoconstriction, etc.)
5. Je sens que j'ai froid
6. L'infection continue, je suis malade

It's a little bit more expensive than the direct train via Frankfurt, but not much. The Cathedral is directly opposite of the central station in Cologne, so you can visit (and maybe have lunch) in the break between trains.

**Edit**: IIRC the train tracks between Cologne and Mainz are along the Rhine, too, (on both sides), so if you take this train, you'll be likely to be able to see one of the most beautiful parts of the Rhine from your train window as you travel.

**Edit 2**: I googled a bit, you need to take IC 30 or IC 31 to go along the Rhine, if you take the ICE you'll be going a different route.

Book ahead on [bahn.de](http://bahn.de/) unless you can get that pass, you can get much better deals if you book in advance. For a fixed itinerary where you are staying in Berlin, Mainz, Munich it might even be cheaper to book the two legs by train in advance compared to getting a pass.

Frankfurt is not that interesting tourist-wise unless you want to see the museums and galleries (which you can also do in Berlin and Munich); I'd recommend to stay in Mainz and maybe visit Frankfurt for one day if you are curious. You can easily reach Frankfurt from Mainz by train (DB or local public transport as both Mainz and Frankfurt are in the RMV area).

Also keep in mind that the Rhine landscape is more beautiful during the warmer months; in February it might be a bit disappointing. To actually visit vineyards/wineries, do a Weinprobe and to see the landscape you need some transportation; maybe you can do with public transport (check out [rmv.de](http://www.rmv.de/)), but it will need planning. An alternative is renting a car for one day. The Rhine in Mainz itself isn't that interesting.

There's enough to see in Munich for three days, so maybe you should rather spend the time sightseeing instead of travelling to another city (no matter if in Austria or not) again. Also, you'll be close to an airport for your return flight (I suppose you have already booked it?)

I can't recommend any hotels, but a bit of searching the web should turn up hotels and prices. Beer or local spirits (Korn etc.) will be no problem. :-)

That's one way of describing it I suppose. It's only the third tallest church in the world with the largest West Front of any cathedral in the world, and is considered one of the finest examples of late mediaeval Gothic architecture.

But you're right, apart from that, Cologne doesn't have a huge amount to offer.

&gt; Frankfurt and most likely going to stay in Mainz

Frankfurt is basically a German city pretending to be Manhattan, and not really doing it very well. The historic centre is mostly gone except for a few buildings at the Römer, but parts of it are being rebuilt, so if you go there, expect construction sites.

Mainz might be more interesting. It's also just across the river from Wiesbaden, which is also worth a look: it's one of Europe's oldest spas. Pretty much everything in the centre was built in the second half of the 19th century, mostly during the period of the German Empire, so it has a remarkably consistent appearance: Neoclassicism, Historicism and Art Deco are the main architectural styles you'll see there (if architecture is your thing).

A local train will take you from Wiesbaden to Rüdesheim, which is a bit of a tourist hell-hole to be honest. But from there it's a bracing walk to the Niederwald Memorial, if the weather plays ball, with commanding views of the Rhine gorge. (There is a cable car as well, but I'm not sure if it operates at this time of the year.) Also read up on the legend of the Mouse Tower (Mäuseturm in German) of Bingen, which I believe you can see from the Niederwald Memorial.

Alternatively, especially if the weather isn't so good, you could take a local train from Mainz towards Koblenz. This goes up the Rhine gorge, the most spectacular part of the Rhine, with the famous Loreley on the opposite bank. You'd have time to look around Koblenz, have lunch and ride back.

null,false,Xantique,LATV,Latvia,null,"&gt; Because employed persons is a easy statistic unemployment measurement varies greatly.  
  
First of all, the unemployment rate provided by local statistical bureaus are the best approximations we have and if you use it consistently throughout the years it shows you the picture of the dynamic. Which in this case has been positive in Latvia since 2010.  
  
Secondly, the nominal statistic of total employed people alone cannot be interpreted in any meaningful way. Again the population is shrinking. At the very least if you have zero trust in the way unemployment is calculated you should take that nominal amount of employed people relative to population size and then compare it year by year. And in that case you will still see that employed people / population ratio is increasing.  
  
&gt;On demographics: In 2008 almost 24,000 children were born. The number dropped below 19,000 in 2011 and even in 2014 Latvia isn't back to the old level.  
  
Again with the nominal statistics. From your own source if you look at the number of births per 1000 inhabitants the number grows from 9.4 in 2010 to 10.8 in 2014.  
  
People have been steadily choosing to emigrate from Latvia since the collapse of USSR in 1991 (source in my previous post). No specific government policy has strongly affected that trend.

&gt;Ariri called the law “completely unfair,” saying he supports greater freedom of expression for the Moroccan press. “French journalists have the right to caricature the Prophet. Why can’t I do the same with the French head of state?"" he asked.

That's exactly a good point.

The Moroccan government ""condemned"" the Hebdo attack, but at the same time they are jailing journalists and satirists of their own country.

You claim to have sympathy for Charlie Hebdo but not your own damn satirists? Fuck you.

Speaking of which, i'm sick of the media releasing press releases from dictatorial Arab and Muslim governments condemning ""attacks"" by Islamists, because apparently they think that these terrible governments represent ""the non-Islamist side"" when they practise the same punishments that the Islamists do on a daily basis. 

What's more insulting to many Muslims than pictures of the Prophet (pbuh) are the corrupt dictatorial governments ""representing Moderate Islam"" to the media.

Vedete, giro nel mondo mediatico da quando avevo 19 anni e ne sono passati 17: lavorare dietro le quinte di radio, cinema e televisioni ti insegna presto a distinguere Persone e Personaggi, vero e plausibile. Non esistono prodotti mediatici non strutturati, pensati, costruiti. 
La Zanzara persegue semplicemente lo scopo che si cela nel titolo stesso: una zanzara è fastidiosa. Fastidio. 
Cruciani ha un personaggio perfetto per infastidire un certo target del pubblico. Idem Parenzo, ha un bersaglio ben specifico ed opposto. Come poi i personaggi chiamati di consueto ad intervenire: politici borderline, sessualita borderline, radical-chic borderline. Tutto fatto nell'esatta misura per creare una piattaforma di pubblico incazzato dal quale emergono i migliori passivi-aggressivi della nazione scatenati in telefonate surreali. 
La Zanzara è un prodotto meraviglioso. Due conduttori + una formula azzeccata + tanti ascoltatori incazzati = tanta raccolta pubblicitaria.

Of course the Soviet soldiers will respond in an equally if not worse manner, war makes people do terrible things. I don't think you need to look far to find warcrimes committed in any war.

Every Monday you start to notice that a certain Supermarket is buzzing with customers. The reason? Milk is on offer there every Monday, *18 cents* cheaper.

Soda pops. There was a time when no-one ever considered anything other than a real coke or a pepsi. Now? €1 for a coke? Shit no, 30c for lidl's freeway cola. Coke stands are full but freeways are empty.

In my municipality, there is a central road full with shops. A 500m (1600ft) stretch of road with little shops left and right.The only shop still open is a Chinese store selling clothes. 

Then you'll start noticing it in the food as well. You start cutting down on fruits, on good meat and especially on fish. Spaghetti with tomato sauce and a piece of bread instead of moussaka and Greek salad.

Eventually it will hit you. When was the last time you bought shoes?

 I bought two pairs of shoes, €37 for both the other week. I went to my local mall. Passed Nike's shop without even window shopping. Passed Adidas and Puma as well. Went into admiral's shop, shoes from €10.

It used to go something like this: Do I like these shoes? Then, can I afford them?

Now, what's the cheapest reasonable shoes I can get? Are they comfortable enough? Then if there is still a choice, you get the one you dislike the least. The one pair I got was orange...I am not an orange shoe wearing type of guy.

10.8 is still lower than 11.2. Your internal devaluation has accelerated the dying process of your country. Your falling unemployment rate is due to people leaving because they can't find a job, which we can see from the employed persons statistic. 

The IMF has admitted that internal devaluation for prosperity doesn't work. Your country is a clear example of it not working. But you seem to think that it's a success to lose ten percent of the population in 6 years. It's not. It also isn't just Russians leaving it's Latvians, too.

&gt; Summary: This paper investigates the relation between growth forecast errors and planned fiscal consolidation during the crisis. We find that, in advanced economies, stronger planned fiscal consolidation has been associated with lower growth than expected, with the relation being particularly strong, both statistically and economically, early in the crisis. A natural interpretation is that fiscal multipliers were substantially higher than implicitly assumed by forecasters. The weaker relation in more recent years may reflect in part learning by forecasters and in part smaller multipliers than in the early years of the crisis.",null,0,null,1422697331,null,0,1422697871,0,co6n8sx,null,t3_2u7ky9,null,t1_co6n8sx,null,t1_co6n00u,null,null,null,1424291360,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Compare key characteristics (economy, demographics, labour, ...) of nations around the world 1900-2015 and you'll see the difference. The latest EU transfers towards the East are peanuts and can hardly make up for what happened.

The big winner of the fall of the SU was the USA. A 1989-2015 comparisson will show an explosion of wealth (economy, demographics, labour, ...). The biggest losers were the countries in Eastern Europe, who turned up robbed, poor and controlled by Brussels/Washington. This control works only as long as people continue to believe the illusion, that it was Russia's fault. And after 25 years of exploitation and on the verge of the ultimate ecomonic collapse, the West decided to push-up the narrative once again.

null,false,vanz,null,null,null,"Some of this has ben already said in other comments, but here's how I see it as a consumer (not a food professional):

For most italians, US food=hamburgers, which probably represent 90% of sales of american-themed restaurants in Italy.

With real traditional food, you might be better off starting off in Milan than in other cities as it seems to be a bigger market for ""ethnic"" food (as we call it here, which is funny because american culture is all but foreign to us, but traditional US food is) while other big cities have a stronger local food traditions and seem to be more squeamish and suspicious about non-locally traditional food. If your market is american tourists, then your choice should be Florence. I'm not sure if american NATO base is a good suggestion because you're choosing a slice of the market and excluding all the others (I suspect US soldiers and locals don't mix well).

Maybe focusing on a known local (US) tradition, like cajun food or Tex-mex would be a better choice, as these are known here and feel more genuine: I'd certainly go to a Cajun restaurant, probably not to a generic US (or, worse, ""american"") food restaurant, where I'd expect to find just hamburgers, onion rings and hot dogs. Also, New England/Maine seafood cuisine sounds interesting. (After all it's not so easy to find clam chowder or even a lobster in Italy). Californian fusion, too. These probably are the most famous local US cuisines in Italy.

Real BBQ stuff like brisket would probably work, too. Can't find a brisket in Italy. For that you could import meat but you'd also have a choice of good italian meat to choose from, from Fassona in Piedmont to Chianina in Tuscany or Mora in Romagna/Marche. You should probably go to Turin and try a few hamburger spots: Eataly's own McBun, Qualeaty, la Burgheria. Piedmont Fassona meat is leaner and more tasteful that the lovcal counterparts in Tuscany/Central Italy (I'm afraid tuscans will not agree with this).

The America Graffiti chain I never tried but it looks pretty touristic to me, though that's a way you might choose which would probably a be safe choice (good quality, not expensive, sizeable hamburgers).

So essentially it would be a society with 3 classes: capitalists (the owner class), advanced labourers (software engineers and other facilitators of automation) and the large masses with obsolete skills that receive a basic income and spend most of their time doing creative or people-focused volunteer work.

Your concerns are valid, but I disagree with you on what should be done. However, I'm not a European, so I feel like an ass commenting this heavily on it anyway. I enjoyed the chat though. 

No problem, I'm not going to discredit you for being American. I do however see it that you have less part in the consequences of this game, you are freeer in your view so to say, either way the affects would be limited to you, while if we need to give Greece more money or cut the debts, that may have significant impacts on us. 

&gt; It helps because austerity is crushing the economies of Greece. Reduce the debt and lengthen out the payments and Greece has a bit more money to spend on jobs and other things which help give people jobs. The new influx of wealth in Greece helps them to pay their debts. At this rate, Greece would just continue to be crushed.

So cutting the debt of the south, means cutting the budget/wealth/pensions in the north, the economic center of Europe. That's a zero sum game where nobody profits. It would ultimately do more harm to Europe than good. 

&gt; Honestly, I feel you there. I come from a family that is not at all wealthy. If one of my parents lost their job, especially my dad, then they'd be fucked. I get the feelings of ""Well, fuck them! We need the help right now,"" but those feelings are only going to make things worse. Things seem to be getting heated over there, but making the Greeks suffer will not help. Instead, allowing the Greeks to prosper will do something, not only for them but for you as well. Greece will be able to contribute, and that's better than letting them go. 

That's okay, as long as they do it on their own feet. We all knew when they gave these loans to Greece ~4 years, that nothing would return. We massively voted for a party with the slogan ""Not a Euro to Greece!"" who won a historic amount of seats. 

Still they gave in to the Eurozone, we knew they wouldn't return it. It's just that it's over now, no more money, no more contributing. Look at the guy smile, it's all a game to him, it isn't his money, why should he care after all? I think we know enough to judge that we shouldn't give them a penny. 

If that means they default, fine, if that means they prosper, congratulations to them.

Giving Greece money at this point, seems like giving a drug addict trying to get clean a dose of cocaine. 

By the way, Greece is never going to contribute. They will always be the recieving side in the EU, but that's a cultural thing. 

&gt; That's a legitimate concern, but SYRIZA might just be the beginning of the cure. However, they need to show the people that they've done something and kept their promises. As I said, watching SYRIZA carefully trusting them but not too far is the most reasonable course of action right now. 

I have watched them closely now. The guy in the video has totally discredited himself for me, the others I read seem to have connections to Russian ultra-nationalists, they have Stalinists, Trotskist and marxists in their party. 

I do not see any reason for trust here. 

One of the problems of Greece was it's public sector, ridled with diseases like nepotism, clientilism etc. 

SYRIZA will now get that sector back instead of privatizing it. 

That means going the wrong way. Which again is fine, just not with our money. 

&gt; Syriza is an opportunity for something new. The Greeks have given power to a new party that is not one of the two that has ruled since the inception of the modern Greek state. 

Perhaps, perhaps not. I did not vote for them, they do not represent me, and I expect to not pay for them either, nor take responsibility for their actions in the form of additional loans or any other way. 

&gt; A Grexit will only make things worse for many years to come. Instead, supporting a government that is working to change things and is trying to get things done will create a better result in a shorter time. 

For them it will make it worse, not for us. Even Germany has already said a Grexit is acceptable at this point. 

For the government part, I see no positive change. the only thing SYRIZA wants is to go back in time on a spending spree to waste others their money. 

I understand lowering the rates and prolonging the period of the bonds to mature can give them some help, by all means let them discuss that. And Dijsselbloem has offered there was room for negotiating there. We still make monthly profit on the rates, so there's room.

However, they think we're going to finance a new spending spree wihile they blow up the public sector again. That's not change, that's decline, that's not improving, that's worsening. 

It was not just the fact that they where bankrupt that we tried to reform them, it's that Greece can not function in a hard currency. That was what they are reforming, and if they don't want that, they can not stay in the Euro. 

Mentality and culture is very important here. These states for years lived on the fact they could alter their currrency to solve things without actually solving it. That must stop now, and SYRIZA doesn't want to do that.

&gt; The EU's economy getting fucked would fuck the U.S. too. It wouldn't be as bad, but the progress America has made recently would fall to the wayside. 

A Grexit will have little to no affect. 4 years ago we would have to bail out our own sectors, now that is done, the debts held would transform into state debts, and we would shove Greek debt on our future generations, the thing this guy is so smiling about.

When engaged in debate, whether it is in the media or not, sadly people do not look rationally at what you actually said. Just because you said ""yes"" in the eye of the average observant the statement posed in the question is the most important one to remember. It does **not** matter what came after the yes.

And it even gets even worse, because after that you will have to defend the statement you did not make, and then when you negate that statement in any way, they will only focus on the ""no"" and they will accuse you of changing your opinion all the damn time.

He answers the question as a man who is aware of this, and despite being pretty well-spoken, he is not an eloquent speaker who can immediately give a short, concise, honest and memorable reply.

By lack of that skill, his answer must be long-winded, or he must ~~face~~ dangerously opt for ""simple"" answers with almost only negative consequences.

Additionally, in 2010 the EU reformed its accounting procedures ( the [European System of Accounts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_System_of_Accounts)) which include reforms that eliminated accounting loopholes which were used and abused to hide deficits and debts.

As an example, when Portugal started its financial assistance program its sovereign debt increased because some accounting tricks pulled by the previous portuguese government were required to be added to the portuguese state's debt.  IIRC, this included debt contracted by public companies and delayed payments required by public-private partnership deals.  In Portugal, the ESA accounting reform resulted in the official debt increasing about 20% in a single year.

The same thing affected Greece's accounting as well, which was compounded by the massive accounting fraud perpetrated by former greek governments.",null,0,null,1422701037,null,0,false,0,co6nxrs,null,t3_2u988g,null,t1_co6nxrs,null,t1_co6npfx,null,null,null,1424291037,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

null,false,Xantique,LATV,Latvia,null,"&gt; So what does Latvia do with the long time unemployed in the statisitic?  
  
Why I'm glad you asked! Same as many other economic indicators long term unemployment rate in Latvia has also [improved since the crisis!](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/latvia/long-term-unemployment-rate)  
  
&gt;10.8 is still lower than 11.2. Your internal devaluation has accelerated the dying process of your country. Your falling unemployment rate is due to people leaving because they can't find a job, which we can see from the employed persons statistic.  
  
In 2008 11.2 births per 1000 inhabitants was the highest birth rate in Latvia since 1994. It was also very logical, since if we assume a reasonable 1 year lag between birth rate and GDP this number correlates with the fact that GDP in 2007 was the highest Latvia has ever seen, due to a severe economy overheating because of the [property bubble.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_states_housing_bubble)  
  
And while 10.8 in 2014 is indeed smaller than 11.2 in 2008 for obvious GDP contracting reasons the trend is POSITIVE. 
9.4 in 2010, 9.1 in 2011, 9.8 in 2012, 10.2 in 2013 and 10.8 in 2014. How is that failure?  
  
&gt;Your falling unemployment rate is due to people leaving because they can't find a job  
  
Have you been reading my posts? People have been steadily emigrating from LV since 1991. It is a country where 25 years ago planned economy was used. It can be argued the labour market are yet to reach some long term equilibrium. 
  
Of course some people left the country during the 2009 crisis, but as you can see [here](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/latvia/population) there haven't been any significant spikes in decline after the austerity program. Population declined at roughly the same rate it did before the crisis.  
  
&gt;The IMF has admitted that internal devaluation for prosperity doesn't work.

The views expressed in this Working Paper are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the IMF or IMF policy. Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=40200.0)  
  
&gt;It also isn't just Russians leaving it's Latvians, too. In fact the share of Latvians of the total population is decreasing.  
  
The [census data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Latvia#Ethnic_groups) disagrees with your unsupported claims. 57.7% Latvians and 29.6% Russians in 2000 vs 61.4% Latvians and 26.0% Russians in 2014.  
  
&gt;Here is the link to the IMF paper:  
  
If you actually opened the paper itself and not just presented the summary you would have seen this in the conclusions:

&gt;Finally, it is worth emphasizing that deciding on the appropriate stance of fiscal policy
requires much more than an assessment regarding the size of short-term fiscal multipliers.
Thus, our results should not be construed as arguing for any specific fiscal policy stance in
any specific country. In particular, the results do not imply that fiscal consolidation is
undesirable. Virtually all advanced economies face the challenge of fiscal adjustment in
response to elevated government debt levels and future pressures on public finances from
demographic change. The short-term effects of fiscal policy on economic activity are only
one of the many factors that need to be considered in determining the appropriate pace of
fiscal consolidation for any single country.

If Greek debt is given a haircut then other EU nations will ask for their own haircut and elect far left governments, encouraging others to elect far right governments.

If there is a Grexit then it will cost the rest of the EU dearly and cause Greece to head to an economy like Moldova. 

If a path is navigated which avoids both then it will be the end of the Eurozone crisis, and the EU can look forwards to a period of time with breathing space to develop into a more robust organisation. Hopefully one that's a bit more progressive.

As far as the UK is concerned we will see an election where the majority of people will vote mildly euro-Sceptic/very euro-Sceptic and if the current polls are to believed will return a pro-euro government because of the way our system works. Personally I'd like to see the European issue in the UK addressed and put to bed.

If you have time, **Barletta** and **Molfetta** are definitely worth a visit.

You've been already told about **Otranto** cathedral, of which the best part is the floor mosaic (much better than the 800 skulls, IMHO).

Just a warning, though: all the places I've mentioned have a lot of mystique around them, and by ""mystique"" I mean ""pseudo-hystorical factoids"".

So, if you hear about alleged influences from the gnostic apocryphal gospels on the Otranto mosaic, or of anything regarding the Templars, please keep in mind that Dan Brown isn't the only one who likes to write pseudo-historical fiction.

Plus, my hometown and cities nearby have a lot to offer, so if you need further tips, please feel free to send me a PM, I could even show you around if I'm in the area at that time.

As a result these 5 Greek banks lost a considerable amount of money. Greece's government at 2008 decided to 'save' these 5 private banks, by acting as a middle man to take a loan, handing the money to the 5 banks, and having Greek taxpayers pay back the loan.
The 5 Greek banks liked receiving free money from the Greek government, and since then they've been continuously asking the Greek government to give them more and more money.


For 7 years the Greek government is taking loans and indebting its citizens, for the shake of giving 5 private banks more and more free money. That has more than doubled Greece's debt, and the EU is complaining about Greece's debt, by blaming the Greek citizens, while it still wants to keep indebting them with more debt, by having the Greek government acting as the middle man between Troika and the 5 banks.


The austerity measures are absolutely worthless and irrelevant to the problem. No matter how many cuts the Greek government do, and how high it will rise its taxes, if it keeps indebting itself hundreds of billions and handing the money to 5 private banks without taking anything in return from them, the debt is only going to becoming bigger and bigger.


In fact,the austerity measures are actually hurting Greece, as what they do is minimizing money flow inside Greece, which is called Recession. The effect of austerity measures is buying power minimization, which means people buy less stuff, which means businesses are receiving less income, which in turn leads many of them to close, and their workers to become jobless.


The Troika is acting as if Greece's debt is huge because of supposed benefits and tax evasion. The truth is that in Greece there are minimal to no benefits, and that while there is some tax evasion, the number 1 reason Greece's debt is huge, is because the Greek governments of the past have been giving away money for free to a handful of private corporations, and charging the government for that. The austerity measures are completely irrelevant to the causes of the Greek debt, and the only thing they do is igniting povetry and reducing Greece's GDP, which just makes the Debt to GDP ratio even worse.",null,0,null,1422701586,null,0,false,0,co6o1f6,null,t3_2u988g,null,t1_co6o1f6,null,t1_co6nebd,null,null,null,1424290989,null,31,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,31,null

If Greece doesn't fix the greek state's finances then it will be impossible for any government to implement any stimulus program, at least without piling yet more debt and compounding its problems.

Begging for loans and subsequently refusing to repay them while begging for additional loans is not a sound economic strategy.  Therefore, Greece has a pressing need to cut its deficit and organize its expenditure so that in the very least they stop depending on additional loans to run their daily affairs.

null,false,rewboss,advanced,advanced,null,"German still has a case system (even if it is a shadow of its former self), and this allows you to be a bit more flexible with word order. Case can be used to describe the relationships between different parts of the sentence; in English, because we no longer have a functioning case system, we have to use word order to do this,

""Einem reichen Mann"" is in the dative case to show that the rich man isn't the one who's died. You might be expecting the genitive case here (""Die Frau eines reichen Mannes...""), but in this case the dative is an acceptable alternative. The genitive would mean ""A rich man's wife died"", but the use of the dative conveys something more along the lines of: ""A rich man found himself in the position of being alone with his daughter due to the death of his wife,"" or ""Following the death of his wife, a rich man..."" It puts the focus of the action more clearly on the man and his predicament, rather than on the action of a woman dying (""A rich man's wife died..."" would more naturally be followed by something like, ""...and went to heaven."")

Because the dative is so different from the nominative, you can switch the usual order around a bit. In this type of sentence, the dative more naturally goes in the first position: although it's not the *grammatical* subject of the sentence, it is the main focus of the sentence -- its *thematic* subject, so to speak. So it makes sense to put it first. The inflected verb in German goes in the second position, and after that comes the grammatical subject.

UKIP overall majority - which simply will not happen we will get one. If they form a coalition they will insist on it. However even if they get 20% of the vote they won't get many MPs so are very unlikely to form a coalition. I'm only mentioning them because they won the EU elections. They have 0 chance of winning the UK general election.

Labour - I don't think labour will put it into their manifesto, but they may well promise one if they feel it will help them during the campaign.

LibDems - Most pro-Europe of the national parties but they're not as opposed to a referendum as the Labour are. So they may permit one if they joined a coalition with the Tories. And in fact they may end up making the referendum a decent one if they do. 

Greens - Will get between 0 and 6 MPs at most, and in my view will get 0. No idea what they'd do about one.

SNP - May form a coalition with the labour and they're pro-EU. Not sure if they would oppose a referendum, but they will not be in a coalition with the tories (they've come out and said that) so I can't see it.

So....

Tory majority - Referendum.

Tory/UKIP coalition - Referendum.

Tory/LibDem coalition - Referendum.

Labour majority - No referendum - unless Labour say so during election.

Labour/LibDem - No referendum - unless Labour say so during election.

Labour/SNP - No referendum - perhaps even if Labour say so during election. 

Labour have been badgered in the past to say yes to a referendum - ""Why are you afraid of what the people say?"" etc. Of all of our parties the Labour are the very worst when it comes to populist stances so they'll do pretty much anything to get elected.

That's what you do when you wish to refinance your debt.

What you failed to mention was that when the market offers cheaper credit than the one you've contracted, refinancing your debt means you spend less money than what you were spending.

The whole motivation behind the multi-billion euro loan granted to Greece was for it to refinance and consolidate its sovereign debt back to manageable levels.  That's why today, the bulk of Greece's sovereign debt is represented by bonds with an extremely low interest rate and a 20/30 year maturity.

Your simplistic assertion makes it look like there is this Machiavellian plan where Greece is somehow being used as a money laundering scheme, and that Greece's entire list of public officials are so incompetent that they aren't even aware they are participating in it.  And yet, they are the ones deciding this.

Additionally, one of the reasons why the current Greek government doesn't want to refinance its debt is because thanks to their hardline propaganda talking points, the market price for Greece's debt skyrocketed, increasing over 5% in a single day.   If Greece's bank run is added to the mix, this is not the best time for Greece to refinance Greece's debt.",null,0,null,1422702565,null,0,false,0,co6o7tj,null,t3_2u7ky9,null,t1_co6o7tj,null,t1_co6b4pu,null,null,null,1424290906,null,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1,null

For a moment the consequences were positive for everyone (a growing economy, higher wages, wealth being spread around) but now they need to pay the piper.  You need to take the bad with the good.

The same thing applies to the current government.  Greece chose them as their representatives, they handed them the reigns to their state, and they will manage it however they want to manage it.

null,false,reagansdeathsquads,lazio,,null,"I'm sorry but one of my closest friends was here in Rome for 3 months here last year trying to get the groundwork done on a branch expansion for an existing business with offices in Germany and several other European countries. She had a not-insignificant amount of funding even though she was just doing research and legal stuff, she had an Italian consultant who worked with businesses, she had a lot of leeway in how things would be set up, and she's very enterprising and motivated. 

After 3 months of almost zero progress, butting head-to-head again and again with the psychotic self-contradictory bureaucracy in Rome, with the ridiculous zoning and store space rental environment (nobody wants to rent a shopfront to a non-Italian or if they think non-Italians are involved), with laws and taxes that most businesses could never afford to pay a consultant enough to track (let alone pay in the end - you have to find somebody who knows the system and can say which ones to follow, which ones to ignore), and myriad other nightmare scenarios and problems you'd never have to think of worrying about in any other country (you ever try to hire an employee in Italy and do it right? what about if he isn't a native Italian with full residency and a recent medical checkup that says he's fit for work?)... it's going to be a lot harder than you think.

Have you ever set up a business at all, let alone in Italy? My friend worked in the tourism industry which is particularly hard to crack in Rome given how important it is to them (and thus they are more eager to manage/squeeze it) but the overall problem is universal; that of Italy making it very difficult for those not in-the-know to get ANYTHING done. Even living here and getting residency, a legal car, a job, paying rent - these are all things that you don't think about in other countries but are a herculean effort here. Are you ready to double-down on that by trying to set up a business? That's not even going into the question of whether or not the premise is sound - have you done actual research into it, or is this your market research now, asking a few people on the Italian subreddit (which in no way represent a significant portion of real Italians)?

I'm not trying to be negative for no reason here, but if you really are established entrepreneurs and have studied start-up businesses and have a few under your belt, you should be aware that Italy isn't in the same ballpark. It's a brutal, inclusive world - if you don't have a fluent, local Italian 100% in on it and running the thing for you as an equal share business partner, you're going to dive head first into a world of shit, lose a lot of money and time and courage, and head home with your tails between your legs.

The problem is not that we don't like children, we love them! Children are awesome.

Germans just really really really dislike uncertainty and really really really really really dislike spending money they don't have.

Thats why most germans (far more than in the US or UK or IT or France) don't own houses, but rent, because owning a house would mean taking a loan because you currently can't afford at the current moment, which is looked down upon but also makes us feel really bad. (One of the reasons investment in germany isn't as high)

May that be for whatever reason (Many people say because of the hunger years after WW2 it became part of the german way of thinking but other people say it happened b4 then sawell) this exists, it is just a fact.

And having children while in itself beeing a good thing, is not only really really expensive (money you don't have if you are young), but also a big uncertainty because you don't know whats going to happen with them later on, its basically our kryptonite!

That is why many germans nowadays, get kids in like their 40s or later, I have several friends with parents like that aswell as my parents beeing about 30-40 years older than me, you are financially stable and certain at that point (usually) sooo its easier to make that desicion, problem is, if you are already that old you won't get a second kid, like ever...

I know soo many people that are from a one child family, so its not like there are SO MANY german families with no kids, but many old german families with one child.

Add to that, that it is currently (sadly) expected in many places in germany that, once you get pregnant you take all the government help you can get which includes stopping to work to take care of your kids (which you get money for), and therefor canceling your career, that many women just don't want to do it.

We need more options for stay at home dads, we need more options for families with 2 working kids, and if we want two children per family we would need to drastically change the german mindset!

And I don't see that working easily, as I said earlier...",null,0,null,1422703115,null,0,false,0,co6obhn,null,t3_2u9686,null,t1_co6obhn,null,t1_co6nlf0,null,null,null,1424290858,null,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4,null

Once in a while the Green Party (Groen Links), which is a merger from the former communist party, pacifists and some left wing movements joins the blob of centre parties and have progressed into something liberal. Fascinating stuff how a Moscow financed Communist Party combines with a pacifist movement turns into a Green Party. Communists are no pacifists or liberals nor are they green, but in this post modern nihilist context anything goes I guess. 

All these parties have relatively minor differences and the ones standing out are the right wing PVV and the Socialist Party. At the fringes of the spectrum, we have some smaller traditional christian parties. This means that all the centre parties have a lot of fierce discussion on minor topics to profile themselves while they know they can't push it to far, because they might end up in a coalition government soon. This results in a dull mess and a powerless PM and government. They lack the votes and the mandate to effectively govern, because non of the centre blob of parties is big enough to push an agenda.  

The PM's party seldom has more votes than about 30% and is dependent on a coalition. The custom is that the party with most votes provides the PM and initiates the forming of a coalition of several parties, usually a combination of the centre blob. This process results in a blend of policies, which make successive governments almost indistinguishable and technocratic.  

Voters are no able to vote on the PM, and the process for candidates to end up on the lists for elections is not regulated. It gives extraordinary power to party boards that in theory could undemocratically push a candidate to become PM. So partisan politics is a big deal,because the outcome of this process largely defines the leverage of the PM and his ability to govern. At the same time there are huge representation issues with this system. Combined with the fact that over 50% of legislation is initiated and implemented by the EU, this leaves a feeling of powerlessness of ordinary citizens.

What's the saying, ""you don't really understand something if you can't explain it simply to others"" or something like that?

--

We're speaking to different aspects of the efficacy of his points. Yes, he is an effective communicator; but that alone doesn't make his position -- or him -- stand-out. Rather his ability to effectively communicate (some) economic principles in a concise and clear manner.

--

&gt;The difference here is he doesn't use the typical language of politicians full of evasions and bullshit. There are two reasons for that imo, *the first one is because he's right which is evident by EU's absolute failure to stop the crisis the last 5 years* and second because he actually respects people enough to try to explain it to them instead of condescendingly use bullshit political language.

--

Yes; because he has a firm grasp on what is going on in terms of the Eurozone's monetary and fiscal policy. Which allows him to speak with confidence. 


----

We're in agreement; simply high-lighting different points. I made the point that understanding the economics makes it harder to argue with him; while you made the point that he is an effective communicator. They build off each-other and compliment each-other -- both are correct.

Greece (and every other country that aspire to western european standard of living) needs large companies that are able to export most of their output, but require a huge funding at the beginning. 

These can be created mainly in 3 ways: state borrows money for funding (like in S. Korea), state and the richest people save money for future investments (like in Germany), and mentioned by you FDI. Of course it's possible now to make a software that'll grow ultra-fast like skype or paypal but such companies are very unlikely to succeed.

The problem with FDI is, they belong to foreign countries and the profits will go to 1) the country with headquarters; 2) tax paradises. Another problem with FDI is brown-fields investing, which seems to be the preferred type for IMF (selling national companies for undervalued price just to get credit). FDIs also rarely hire highly qualified people for R&amp;D jobs (thus middle income trap).

Autrement dit : si tu es blessé par une ""blague"" qui reprend tous les clichés réacs, ferme ta gueule et encaisse. Avec le sourire. Mais, attention, hein, c'est pas sérieux comme truc !

&gt;Je n'ai pas d'humour. Voilà, comme ça, c'est dit. J'ai préféré préciser ce point d'entrée de jeu pour que les choses soient claires... Parce qu'on va me le reprocher, et parce que c'est aussi de ça dont je voudrais parler : de toutes ces situations où l'on reproche à l'autre de ne pas comprendre ou de ne pas vouloir comprendre que c'est de l'humour. De ces petites phrases simples que l'on lâche facilement : ""c'est bon, c'est de l'humour"", ""c'est pas sérieux"", ""faut pas le prendre au premier degré"", ""mais personne n'y croit vraiment !"", et toutes ces sortes de choses. Et comme je n'ai pas d'humour, je vais faire appel pour cela à quelqu'un qui en avait beaucoup : Erving Goffman.

&gt; (...)

&gt; En quoi consiste alors le ""oh, c'est bon, c'est de l'humour"" ou le ""tu comprends pas le second degré ou quoi ?"" qui est la défense si souvent utilisée dans ces cas-là ? Il ne s'agit pas seulement d'une tentative de sauver la face - ""je ne suis pas raciste voyons"". Il s'agit aussi d'une attaque contre la face de l'autre : après avoir détruit une première fois la représentation positive que l'autre essaye de donner de lui, vous en remettez une couche en détruisant une autre partie de cette face. Une double peine en quelque sorte : c'est un peu comme si, après avoir marché sur le pied de quelqu'un, vous lui donniez une gifle parce qu'il a crié de douleur. Se faisant, vous sacrifiez en fait l'interaction que vous pouvez avoir avec l'autre, et avec tous ceux qui peuvent soit partager son identité soit être d'accord avec son point de vue, pour le droit de faire une blague. Autrement dit, pour une chose qui censé être sans importance, vous êtes prêt à sacrifier des relations, des interactions, peut-être des amis...

What loan to the ECB? 

Most of the debt now is held by sovereign states, such as Finland, Germany and The Netherlands. 

These states have raised that money on the market, lend it to Greece, and pay the interest on that. 

Cutting in Greek debt would mean the state debt of Finland will increase with their part. Finland will have to keep paying interest on that, and roll them over until you pay your share back. 

I think for Finland it's around 10 billion Euro via the Eurozone alone, maybe 1-2 billion Euro via the IMF. 

That will be your debt if the Greeks do not pay, not the ECB. And the interest rates will be paid by you if the Greeks don't, not the ECB.

 [**Muiñeira**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mui%C3%B1eira): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Muiñeira__ is a traditional dance and musical genre of [Galicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia,_Spain) (Spain). It is distinguished mainly by the tempo of [6/8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6/8), played expressive and lively, although some variants are performed in other time signatures. There are also variant types of muiñeira which remain in the tempo of 6/8 but which displace the accent in different ways. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Muiñeira is associated with traditional choreographic schemes and the associated instrumentation is a form of bagpipe known as a [gaita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_gaita). It is subject to highly varied interpretation in differering local traditions. According to ""Galicia-The Spanish Cousins"", an article on Roots World,  muiñeira is the Galician ""equivalent"" of a [jig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jig), which is consistent with the time signature of 6/8. The word ""muiñeira"" (the same pronunciation in Portuguese, but spelled ""moinheira"") means literally both millstone and a mill landlady (or the miller's wife, if a man). Galician music is classified as part of Celtic music.

Just look at the US-financed death-squads that have run riot around central and south America where they've had the temerity to have a government that won't kowtow to Washington. Or the coups organised and paid for by the US to remove unco-operative governments. Or countries like Greneda which The US invaded to force a change of government.

null,false,ruber_r,CZEC,Czech Republic,null,"There are two points I think. 

First - the hate for gypsies is unnecessary excessive and doesn´t help to solve their situation at all, it´s making all just worse. I feel the same disturbance as you when some coworker or even family member starts his rant about gypsies randomly. Just pure hate without any serious attempt to solve it in any reasonable way.

Second - there are problems with gypsies that everybody sees. In the Czech republic, we have maybe 200.000 gypsies (2% of the population), but they make +50% of prisoners. More then 80% of them have no work and are living on welfare and/or crime. They refuse to send their children to schools. They show very racists views toward gádžos (white majority). They feel proud when they con a gadžo. When a gypsy family moves somewhere, the real estate price of your property falls, if several gypsy families move into the same block-of-flats as you, your own flat becomes almost worthless.

Our communistic soviets-led goverment tried to assimilate them by force for decades, without significant results. They still remain on the fringe of the society. The most worring fact is that while there were less then 1000 gypsies in the Czechia after 1945, we have +200.000 now and their numbers continue to grow. While our country can somehow financially afford to feed 200.000 on welfare/in prisons, there will be time when their numbers will become simply unsustainable.

The only solution in my eyes is education of their children. Our goverment must acomplish it somehow, even by force if neccessary, against the will of their own parents.

This combined with the fact the government then had to bailout the banks for about €80 billion almost bankrupt the state and stopped lenders giving Ireland loans. This resulted in Ireland needing a bailout of about €80 billion from the IMF, EU and UK (The UK gave us the biggest loan of the 3 separately to the EU).

Ireland then implemented all of the changes recommended to the government by the ECB and IMF. Many were unpopular but people generally accepted them as I believe Irish people understood the blame for the situation was on Irish banks and the government and not the EU. EU support in Ireland is still one of the strongest of all 28 EU members. 

Implementing these changes has resulted in Ireland today having the fastest growing economy in the EU, unemployment dropping quickly in the past year, our economy is now more stable and more protected than before to hopefully prevent this happening again.

Greece's case is different because Greece didn't run trade surplus when the crisis hit them and now they can't inflate nor devalue with euro, which is like a gold standard among the eurozone countries. They need to develop a cometitive economy and they have to do it in unfavorable conditions.

If the euro zone were to let greece pay zero percent interest, it would be rather unfair to Spain and Portugal, who have to pay higher interest rates than greece is currently.

Completely agree. 

Same goes for debt cuts. We can't let Greece cut in debts, and the others not. And if everybody starts cutting in their debts, Germany and surroundings would financially crash. Our banking sector would crash, our pension funds would evaporate etc.

That would be 2008 all over again.

&gt;  It would be easier for these countries aswell if they did not have to pay interest... However this is true for every country. 

Yes, well they can default and leave the Eurozone. Then they can suspend interest payment and see if they can stand on their own feet.

Maybe I'm optimist, but it also seems to be improving, and especially in the North things aren't that bad.  Find the right spot in the city and it shouldn't be hard. Any of the large cities along the A4 (Turin-Milan highway) will probably do: Turin, Milan, Bergamo, Brescia, Verona, Vicenza, Padua.

I would not look for a spot in touristy areas. The rent would be insane. It's probably easier to look around business areas, because people visit restaurants for a quick lunch. Restaurants almost always have a prix-fixe meal (one or two entrees&amp;mdash;American meaning of entree :)&amp;mdash;and coffee) for lunch Mon-Fri, in addition to a la carte every day lunch and dinner. Basically the prix fixe meal keeps you alive, and the regular menu makes you money.

New England food is great IMO, but I think it wouldn't really fit Italy very well. We are much more opinionated on seafood than on meat, and lobster here is fucking expensive. A couple dishes here and there (clam chowder, crab cake as a starter or as a prix fixe entree) would be great though.

Offering meat dishes in both US and Italian beef variants (Fassona FTW) could also be a way to make Italians feel more proud. We totally are whores in that respect.

Oh, and beer too. Check out breweries in the area, and partner to get good beer to go with your meals.

And their ideology is fucking crazy! They believe they have to restore 1914 borders(which includes Finland).  And arguing with Russians here on reddit mostly leaves an impression that this type of thinking is becoming a mainstream.

And here are few characteristics of their ideology(that in my mind suggests fascist tendencies). 


&gt;First, RISI believes that “the states of the post-Soviet space are not full subjects of international relations” but rather “the result of the Russian catastrophes of 1917 and 1991, which were provoked by the enemies of Russia led by the [United States]. Their sovereignty is thus a temporary phenomenon, something that does not deserve serious attention” and should be eliminated through their incorporation into a restored Russian Empire.

&gt;Third, RISI argues that “**only Russians are a state-forming people in the post-Soviet space**, and this means that the single form of political existence of this space must be a Russian Empire.”

null,false,_mael_,ZZZZZtroll,Face de troll,null,"Je suis tombé sur des notes que j'avais prises il y a quelques mois, j'avais fait quelques recherches à propos de parasites qui ont la particularité des modifier le comportement de leurs hôtes. Du coup, je me suis dit que je pourrais les partager ici.

[**Toxoplasma gondii**](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii). Il augmente la production de dopamine dans le cerveau de l'hôte. Chez le rat, cela se traduit par une modification du comportement du rongeur, qui n'a plus peur du chat, et pire encore, qui est attiré par les chats : il a été montré que l'odeur de l'urine de chat produit une excitation sexuelle chez un rat infecté. La raison de ce phénomène est que si le toxoplasma gondii peut infecter tous les animaux à sang chaud, il ne peut se reproduire que chez les Félidés. Le parasite serait également responsable de [modifications du comportement chez l'être humain](http://www.journaldelascience.fr/sante/articles/la-toxoplasmose-modifie-la-quantite-de-dopamine-dans-le-cerveau-et-peut-etre-aussi-notre-personnalit-2388).

[**Spinochordodes tellinii**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinochordodes_tellinii). Ce ver parasite a pour particularité de se reproduire dans l'eau une fois adulte. Le problème est qu'il infecte des insectes comme la sauterelle qui ne vivent pas dans l'eau. Problème résolu : une fois que le ver s'est développé dans son hôte et a atteint l'âge adulte, il force son hôte à se jeter dans l'eau, et il n'a plus qu'à sortir pour aller se reproduire tranquillement. Il faut noter qu'à l'âge adulte, le ver peut être 3 ou 4 fois plus long que son hôte. Voici un exemple d'une mante religieuse infectée : http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x21e2yb_mante-religieuse-zombie_animals.

[**Dicrocoelium dendriticum**](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicrocoelium_dendriticum). Ce ver parasite a un cycle de développement assez complexe, puisqu'il va successivement infecter 2 hôtes intermédiaires, avant d'infecter son hôte définitif pour s'y reproduire. Il manipule son 2ème hôte intermédiaire : une fourmi. La fourmi infectée va avoir un comportement assez étrange : tous les soirs, elle quitte la colonie pour grimper sur un brin d'herbe, puis elle plante ses mandibules dans le brin d'herbe et reste plantée là toute la nuit. Au petit matin, elle quitte son brin d'herbe et vaque à ses occupations habituelles. Le soir venu, rebelotte, elle grimpe sur un brin d'herbe. Et elle va recommencer jusqu'à ce qu'un ruminant mange le brin d'herbe sur lequel elle se trouve. La raison de ce comportement est que le ruminant est l'hôte définitif du parasite, il se reproduit dans son système digestif. Et la raison pour laquelle la fourmi ne doit pas rester sur son brin d'herbe pendant la journée est qu'elle mourrait, et son parasite avec.

[**Microphallus papillorobustus**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphallus) (nom rigolo, au passage). Ce parasite infecte deux hôtes intermédiaires, donc l'un est une sorte de crevette (Gammarus insensibilis). Ses hôtes définitifs sont plusieurs espèces d'oiseaux prédateurs. Le problème est que la Gammarus insensibilis a tendance à vivre au fond de l'eau, ce qui ne facilite pas la prédation par ces oiseaux. Le parasite a résolu le problème en forçant la crevette à s'approcher de la surface (il agirait sur la sensibilité de la crevette vis à vis de la lumière). Et quand un prédateur s'approche, au lieu de fuir, la crevette infectée se met à tournoyer pour attirer l'attention du prédateur, qui ne se fait pas prier.

[**Glyptapanteles**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyptapanteles). Il s'agit d'une guêpe qui dépose ses oeufs dans le corps d'une chenille. La chenille va vivre normalement jusqu'à ce que des larves émergent de son corps. La chenille va alors se placer près des chrysalides et arrêter de bouger. Parfois, elle recouvre les chrysalides de soie. Lorsque qu'elle est dérangée, la chenille s'agite. Elle finit par mourir, faute de s'alimenter. La chenille sert en fait de protection aux chrysalides : si un prédateur s'approche, il sera plus facilement attiré par la chenille qui s'agite que par les chrysalides immobiles.

[**Leucochloridium paradoxum**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucochloridium_paradoxum). Ce ver parasite est un peu particulier : il ne manipule pas son hôte intermédiaire pour qu'il se jette dans la gueule de son hôte définitif : en fait, il manipule son hôte définitif au travers de son hôte intermédiaire. C'est un ver qui se reproduit dans le système digestif de certaines espèces d'oiseau. Ses oeufs sont ensuite expulsés dans les crottes de ces derniers. Les oeufs sont ensuite absorbés par des escargots. Le parasite va alors se développer au sein des antennes de l'escargot, et manipuler l'aspect physique de ce dernier pour qu'il [ressemble à une chenille](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Succinea_mit_Leucocholoridium.jpg). Les oiseaux seront alors attirés par la ""chenille"" et vont la consommer, absorbant ainsi le parasite.

[**Myrmeconema neotropicum**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmeconema_neotropicum). Ce nématode a comme hôte intermédiaire une fourmi à l'abdomen noir, et comme hôte définitif différentes espèces d'oiseaux. Problème : ces oiseaux ne consomment pas de fourmis. Qu'à cela ne tienne, le ver modifie l'aspect de la fourmi : son abdomen devient rouge. Il modifie également son comportement pour que la fourmi se déplace avec l'abdomen dirigé vers le haut. Les oiseaux la prennent alors pour une baie, et la mangent...

[**Ophiocordyceps unilateralis**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis). Il s'agit ici d'un champignon présent dans les forêts tropicales qui a la particularité de modifier le comportement d'une fourmi pour que celle-ci quitte la canopée pour se rendre plus près du sol, où le taux d'humidité et la température sont plus propices au développement du champignon. Une fois l'endroit atteint, le champignon force la fourmi à planter ses mandibules dans la veine d'une feuille, puis la tue. Il [continue son développement](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis.png) pendant quelques jours, puis libère des spores qui vont infecter d'autres fourmis... D'après certaines découvertes préhistoriques, il serait possible que ce champignon (ou des champignons semblables) aient ce comportement depuis des dizaines de millions d'années.
