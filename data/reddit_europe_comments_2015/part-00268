Greece never qualified for OMT, and in the case of Portugal and Ireland, they have never been applied because they fulfilled the conditions either.

&gt;And if the ECB were to recapitalize the ESM we would see a run-away inflation even worse then we already had in the past months.

We would be in full deflation if the ECB wasn't doing QE at a rate of 60 billion per month. We don't have inflation, let alone runaway inflation. So what are you afraid of?

Fundamentally, it wouldn't create inflation - it would reduce inflation. Much of Greece's debt - the unsustainable part - is purely compound interest, i.e. credit that never would have existed if the eurozone properly supported its members and was able to threaten the bond markets with OMT earlier. So extinguishing that credit with ECB credit would *reduce* the total credit supply, not increase it.

Just saying. You can get pretty much that computer brand new for pretty much the same price. Nice that you get the gaming keyboard/mouse but as those are used as well not worth a whole lot.

If you wanted to sell it fast I would drop to 400-500 but maybe 600-700 as people seemed to buy overpriced used stuff here a lot. (Example: I bought a no-name single-speed bike for 200 brand new on Ebay. I rode it for 2 and a half years. During that time I took off a break, cut the handle bars down with a saw, and painted it with spray paint. I sold it for 175 after the guy talked me down from 200 hehe)

TL;DR
It might be hard to sell at that price, maybe drop it down €100-200.

Best of luck =)

&gt; The public radio and television stations in the USA are 100% donation based

This is not true.

Sul serio? Ecco i passaggi imbarazzanti:

&gt;Scorbutici e geniali. A volte non lasciano mai casa. Vengono fotografati sempre con la stessa t-shirt.

Ma parliamo di cartoni animati o di un'intera categoria professionale?

&gt; [Sir Tim Berners-Lee] Ha inventato il termine “World Wide Web”

Non solo il termine, l'intero concetto. È come dire che Yakov Rekhter e Kirk Lougheed hanno inventato il termine ""Border Gateway Protocol"".

&gt; [Richard Stallman] è il paladino più oltranzista dell’open source (che preferisce definire ""software libero"")

Sono cose diverse e la distinzione è importante per Stallman. Ma il giornalista è un imbecille.

&gt; Preferisce chiamare il sistema operativo di Torvalds GNU/Linux: è un prefisso che contraddistingue i programmi liberi da copyright.

Qui l'imbecille confonde GNU col GPL e la licenza col copyright.

&gt; Ha inventato Java. Il vantaggio principale di questo linguaggio di programmazione è la multi-scalabilità, e cioè il codice è in grado di girare su qualunque tipo di computer senza essere riscritto.

Questa è portabilità, non scalabilità.

&gt; Non è esente da critiche: è ritenuto lento

Quando hai parlato di Ruby on Rails non hai detto niente della lentezza, ma è la prima critica che ti viene in mente per Java?

&gt; favorisce una programmazione disordinata

Ma è Java, porco papa, mica Basic! Quale programmazione disordinata?

&gt; Ma non bisogna dimenticare che la prima programmatrice della storia è stata una donna: Ada Lovelace. Figlia del poeta inglese Lord Byron, è stata definita “l’incantatrice dei numeri”.

null,false,justkjfrost,FRAN,France,null,"&gt; The problem is that the Greek GDP was ballooned by sovereign debt bubble.

Economics are funny, everytime the economy crash for whatever reason people yell ""IT WAS A BUBBLE !"". Even if it was because we fired all the workers and pensionners to give their wage back to germany instead.

&gt; in 2009 it was 9.8% and in 2010 it was 15.7% of GDP. In 2010 the primary deficit, that is deficit before interest payments 9.6%. 

And how much in raw numbers ? Because if the spending only followed inflation but the GDP crash...

&gt; What happened that Greek governments loaned more and more money to fuel the economy

Of course, since the EU only wanted to give them loans and ""federal cash transferts to greece like to the eastern landers in germany"" are an insult.

Say, you have no income and the bill fall. Then suddenly you borrow to your family to pay it. And the next. And after 3 months, they tell you ""no you spent it all like a drunk sailor !"". Is the problem that you did spend it all on booze &amp; drugs ? No (you paid bills only	 with it). It's because you have no income (GDP crash).

&gt; And Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Slovenia, etc... all have smaller GDP per capita than Greece and they are not complaining

Because their GDP is rising. Oh and BTW estonia is basically the local luxembourg-like capital of tax fraud &amp; evasion. I sure don't hear Luxembourg complain when they make a million because they helped a company fraud a billion of taxes. But system wide ? That kills it if they all do it.

&gt; The reason why Greek are feeling pressure is that they are adjusting to a lower level of GDP where they would had naturally been without the debt bubble. 

Or, because we forced them to fire everyone so nobody in the country has any money left to spend and since they have an import-driven economy, if nobody can import anything, the entire economy simply dies.

&gt; The compromise that the Juncker and Institutions came up that no pensions would be cut but EKAS would be cut. 

Then ""suddenly they decided"" to cut both once he was out of the picture. Yeah.

&gt; I would put my blaming finger on this to Syriza

[Of course. Of course.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_blaming)

&gt; Do remember that if pensions would be cut, it would hurt mostly ex-public workers that are also voters of Syriza.

Looking at the cuts it'll hurt everyone because half the cash in the country is going away. And they have no money left to import anything.

&gt; The interest rates that Eurozone countries pay are extremely low. 

So, say you have an account that say 0€. Whether you owe 1B or 1.005B or 1.2B is irrelevant : It's not viable.

&gt; But like I said before, if Greeks don't want to even pay interests, then they can default

Then you kick them out of the EU and freeze trade with them and all their accounts abroad ""to recover the money"". Which will even starve them some more. There's no winning move for them there. It's blackmail rationning or outright starvation to death. You know what they say about not putting an angry afraid dog in a corner ?

&gt; All Eurozone countries that have loaned money have already understood that Greece will not be able to pay back its debt in any short term future.

And now you are using that against greece to put constantly harder terms on them.

&gt; That is why Greece got relief to interest rates and maturities of loans were extended.

Let me correct you : You only extended the maturities because if not Syriza would have been immediately removed by a revolution at home then the GD would have been immediately in power and their first action i don't want to think about it.

&gt; If debt would be cut, then there would be backlash in other Eurozone states that would basically shut in any new emergency loans

Worse than a greek nazi party in power plotting to attack turkey, put immigrants in concentration camps and killing germans on sight, defaulting on all debts, harassing FYROM; and some more ? Did you ever looked at how the greek junta could be ?

&gt; The fine line that Eurozone politicians are trying to walk is to make sure that Greece doesn't go bankrupt and that it starts to grow, but get as much loaned money back as possible.

And i think they're asking for way too much for proper growth. I don't know, honestly.	",null,0,null,1436881239,null,0,1436886402,0,ct2vv6l,null,t3_3d8b3k,null,t1_ct2vv6l,null,t1_ct2v7w6,null,null,null,1437843698,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

A lot. Hotel owners and assorted scum have already closed off beaches (illegally) and no-one is happy about that.

---

&gt;__Don Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja, 2nd Marquis of Estella, 22nd Count of Sobremonte, Knight of Calatrava__ (January 8, 1870 – March 16, 1930) was a [dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator), aristocrat, and military officer who served as [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Spain) of [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) from 1923 to 1930 during Spain's [Restoration era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_(Spain\)). He deeply believed that it was the politicians who had ruined Spain and that governing without them he could restore the nation. His slogan was ""Country, Religion, Monarchy."" Historians depict him as an inept dictator who lacked clear ideas and political acumen, and who alienated his potential supporters such as the Army. He did not create a base of support among the voters, and depended instead on elite elements. His actions discredited the king and ruined the monarchy, while heightening social tensions that led in 1936 to a full-scale [Spanish Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War).

GREAT *Economist* article from last year: http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21628597-after-decades-messianic-fervour-iran-becoming-more-mature-and-modern-country

Highlights/summary of the article:

&gt; For now, Iran is disliked and mistrusted across much of the democratic world. Terrible things have been done in the name of its revolution. Some of its leaders have denied the Holocaust.

&gt;Yet the country has unmistakably changed.

&gt; The offspring of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the revolution, have flocked to Instagram and embrace Western mores. 

&gt; The appetite for revolution has waned on all sides. Reformists are tired after their failed attempt in 2009 to push aside a government they considered illegitimate because the vote was rigged. Protests were put down bloodily, reminding many of the unhappy years after the revolution. Since then, reformists have recoiled at political bloodshed in neighbouring countries.

&gt; “Tehran looks and feels these days more like Madrid and Athens than Mumbai or Cairo.”

&gt; Although the media are controlled by the state, uncensored news is easily available.

&gt;  In 2009, 34% of Iranians in the relevant age group went to university. Three years later the number had gone up to 55% and is said to have climbed further since then, mostly thanks to the huge expansion of Azad University, which now has over 100 campuses and 1.5m students. Iran’s cabinet has more members with PhDs from American universities than that of America itself; the president, Hassan Rohani, got his in Scotland. 

&gt; According to SCImago, a Spanish firm that monitors academic journals, Iran’s scientific output has increased by 575% in the past decade. The country also publishes three times more books than all Arab nations combined.

&gt;  The majority of Iranians are Shia Muslims; they generally put less emphasis on public worship than Sunnis, but that alone cannot explain the many empty mosques.


Edit: Also, this *Economist* article on the waning of religion among the Iranian public: http://www.economist.com/node/21628596

&gt;The transformation of Shia Islam into an ideology undermined both the state and the mosque. The great irony of the Islamic revolution is that inadvertently it did more to secularise the country than the tyrannical shah, who ruled Iran after a coup in 1953 and persecuted clerics. By forcing religion on people it poisoned worship for many.",null,0,null,1436881977,null,0,1436882305,0,ct2w9cq,null,t3_3d8af4,null,t1_ct2w9cq,null,t1_ct2q5og,null,null,null,1437844009,null,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12,null

Look at it from Merkels position. The EU normally doesn't seem to have the ability to force reforms on Greece to combat corruption and tax dodging. In a normal situation the Greeks would never agree to any outside pressure.

Ich habe meine erste Ausbildung auch nach 1,5 Jahren abgebrochen und jetzt beruflich wenigstens schon mal einen Bachelor. Außerdem bin ich als Prästudiumssportmuffel nen Halbmarathon gelaufen, hab im Jahr 2013 ca. 20.000 Fotos gemacht, bin n ziemlich guter Barkeeper und noch dies das andere.

Kommentarlos wäre es jetzt eher kontraproduktiv sowas zu schreiben, da

1. Angeberei,
2. vielleicht dein Gedanke ""das schaffe ich doch nie"" oder aber auch ""das will ich doch gar nicht"",

und damit hast du Recht. Deswegen such dir deine eigenen Ziele und grenz dich von negativen Gedanken weitestgehend ab. Es gibt viel zu viele Menschen, die etwas Kleines und Beschützendwertes zerstören wollen. Nämlich Ideen. Halt sie (also die Ideen) nah bei dir und überlege, wem du dich anvertraust. 

Wie gesagt, für den Anfang musst du ja auch nicht übertreiben, denk nur daran:

1. Erst kümmer ich mich um mich selbst,
2. dann geht es mir gut und ich tue Dinge,
3. die dann auch wieder positiv auf andere Menschen wirken.

(Das sind natürlich *Maxime* mit *Ausnahmen*)

So zumindest meine Erfahrung. Aber es ist wie gesagt auch ständige Übung und auch nach ca. 4 Jahren würden ich nicht sagen, dass ich am Ende bin (das wäre wohl auch langweilig).

That was a choice because Argentine wanted to preserve better access to future loans. So they negotiated a haircut with (most) creditors.

&gt; Leaving the EZ pretty much guarantees leaving the EU on the long run. The only countries within the EU with no plan to get to EZ are those with strong economies. So -yeah- a Grexit implies an exit from EU as well (on the shorter or longer run)...

I don't see that. There are economically weaker countries in the EU that havent yet joined the EZ (though they want to and likely will in the future); I don't see why there couldn't be an economically weaker economy that isn't part of the EZ nor wants to (or is wanted to be...).

Even Greece had returned to growth for the quater before Syriza gained power. Economics is a notriously bad science.

Very fair point. The most important economic reason not to save greece.  But that phenomenon is explained:

One countries (let's say Greece) economy exports are affected by all the other economies everywhere. Any local change in the countries that buy and sell to greece will affect Greece. In other worlds, everyone is getting richer now, so everyone can afford more, so they will buy more greek yougurt and olive oil and travel to the greek islands on their vacations. The VAT is higher, peoples salaries are lower, people are poorer than before the 2008 crisis, but things are getting better. 

But the economy is a kind of a sinusoid, it goes up and down. It did go down in 2001, 2008 and it will go down again this year, next year or whenever. But it's going to happen. It's how it works. 

So when all markets enter bear and the world economy enters a recession ([look at this beautiful graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycle#/media/File:Kondratieff_Wave.svg)), the greece growth will end. And greece will fall again, only this time she will fall harder than before. Because people are poorer now than at the begin of the last recession. The country never got to it's feet, it only supported on everyone elses shoulder.

And this is why austerity is bad. If an economy is ravaged by a recession, you must invest and recover it. Those are fragile economies and if you ravage them even more just to pay debt after debt, like they did on the PIIGS, the economies will be even more fragile at the begin of the next recession than they were at the begin of the last one. 

&gt; But unfourtunatlly there is no reason why Greece deserves a present more than poland or latvia, and plenty of reasons why not.

Another fair point and Imo the most important ethical reason not to save greece.

It's not about what greece deserves, it's about what greece needs.

The guys who were born in greece are not at fault for not having born in Germany or Finland or elsewhere. Nor for having different education, culture and society. It would be unethical to force them to be ""more like us"", but it's them asking for ""us"" to intervene and it's also not unethical to raise concerns about ensuring the greeks responsibility on the loans ""we"" provide.

My point is: greeks need europa's help. Now, not in 2 years, not in 3 years. They fucked up. And we either fix it for good or we send them away. But austerity is not fixing, austerity is delaying 6 months, 1 year, 2 years at max and worsening the crash when it actually happens. The greeks know that, that's why they voted yes to europe, yes to the euro and no to austerity. They want their country fixed and they asked for ""our"" help. 

Now, of course other peripheral economies not only deserve more (because they were good boys and did as they were told) as well as they need as much an intervention as Greece. But we need to start somewhere, we need to stop austerity and stop this mess.

Is that fair to the rich germans? No. But the world is not fair, the world was not fair to the greek kid who was born from poor parents either. It's up to us humans to make it fair.

I would point to the same answer I gave in my comment to your old post from January 2014, to which you linked from this one: many Ordoliberals' definition of ""Keynesian"" or ""Keynesianism"" is more or less bizarre, so the ""Keynesianism"" they're rejecting is a chimera. This is not a complete explanation in itself (far from it) but I still think that it's at least a key building block towards one.

And as a Finn, I would also emphasise the other thing I emphasised in my old comment, because it's still not generally known abroad, and even if it's known, not generally understood: there is a second country in Europe with much the same attitude to Keynesianism as Germany, and this is Finland. Both in the culture of economic policymaking, and in newspaper debate and other public debate on same. There are some differences; but the language and tone of many newspaper editorials on economic policy, for instance, is often eerily similar in the two countries. As is the fact that the macroeconomics textbooks are Keynesian through and through, but routinely ignored and denigrated in policymaking.

So the question ""What it is about German economics?"" is largely the same as ""What it is about German and/or Finnish economics?""

Here's Greece's repayment profile: [graph](http://i.imgur.com/Rkoxk2Q.png)

The bilateral loans from the EZ governments (the first bailout) start having repayments only in 2020. And the second bailout loans through the EFSF only in 2022. And even as those loans already have very low interest rates the profits are given back to Greece. So those loans are hardly the reason for Greece's problems servicing its debts, and restructuring them now is not the solution either.

It is obvious the immediate problem are the repayments to the IMF, the ECB and the T-bill holders (mostly Greek banks).

Of those:

* The IMF, while supporting debt restructuring, will not restructure its loans.

* The ECB is bound by its rules and will not restructure its loans.

* That leaves only the T-bill owners. Then the Greek banks and by extension the Greek savings would be fucked.

So, perhaps those proposing that the four biggest banks in Greece should be merged to only two are onto something: [Exclusive: Greek banks face closures, bailout or not - sources](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/08/us-eurozone-greece-bankclosures-idUSKCN0PI2KI20150708)",null,0,null,1436885304,null,0,1436885579,0,ct2y77b,null,t3_3d8w0m,null,t1_ct2y77b,null,t1_ct2vmef,null,null,null,1437844699,null,21,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,21,null

null,false,tanantish,null,null,null,"Varoufakis wants an exit and revolution of sorts, at least in my mind. 

Looking at his actions, he's be consistently willing to push things to the brink because I think he believes (not without some reason) that a full exit is the best outcome. In essence, the ultimate power of a sovereign nation is to do whatever the heck it wants and Varoufakis thinks that if they exercise it to undertake a unilateral restructuring of debt Greece can make a better go of it than if they had to manage within the current euro framework. I don't know if I necess agree there, I think the repercussions of unilateral actions like that are pretty significant.

In that context, does any of what he's doing seem odd? He's basically playing at poisoning the well. Tsipras and the government really, really, REALLY need the support of the public to get things done. Since he doesn't/didn't have the support of Tsipras, then he's found a good excuse to leave, and now can snipe from the sidelines, polarize the debate, and set the EU up as an evil hegemony. Bonus - it'll polarize the eurogroup as well, which makes it more likely that the hardline elements will gain dominance in negotiations which will reinforce local politics etc etc, which will lead to a general balking and inability of the government to implement reforms demanded by creditors, and once the whole thing falls down in a heap, well, hey, you might as well try the ""energetic"" option he championed early on.

I don't know enough about local politics there, but that's my read. Additionally, the other aspect that concerns me is that while he's actively gambling with a generation or two of Greek lives (not to mention the impacts on the EU project) yet I get this distinct sensation that he's seeing this as a political/economic/theoretical exercise and doesn't quite get the severe pain that the country is in for. 

Scuse any annoyance spilling over by the way, I just find it horribly frustrating to watch this from the sidelines here :P

Ti faccio un ctrl+c/ctrl+v direttamente dal sito:

Molte persone ci hanno chiesto che senso ha organizzare una rievocazione storica del periodo celtico nell’area del delta padano. Questo perchè pochi sanno che i Celti furono fra i primi e più importanti abitatori delle nostre terre che i romani chiamarono Gallia Cisalpina e le cui genti si definivano Galliche fino al tardo medioevo. Per diverse ragioni questa pagina cruciale del popolamento e dello sviluppo del territorio di Bondeno e della intera area padana è stata praticamente rimossa, ridotta a qualche nozione generica e riduttiva che non rende l’importanza di un periodo durato diversi secoli, durante i quali si è formata la nostra lingua ferrarese, la nostra cultura e le nostre tradizioni. Per contro, al tombale silenzio della storiografia ufficiale, che ha mortificato la conoscenza del cestismo cisalpino, ha fatto da contraltare una colossale speculazione da parte di sette religiose caserecce, movimenti new age, pseudomaghi, storici dalle idee confuse e ciarlatani assortiti, che hanno mistificato la cultura e le tradizioni celtiche per fini propri associandoli al nazismo, alla massoneria, all’ordine templare, ai più svariati riti esoterici e così via. È da queste premesse che nasce l’Associazione culturale Teuta Lingones, determinata a restituire un’immagine storicamente corretta del popolo celtico e a dimostrare come queste antiche ma ancora forti radici, affondando nell’esperienza imperiale romana e nell’humus della cristianità medioevale, abbiano generato attraverso oltre venti secoli di storia un popolo unico, cerniera tra il mondo mediterraneo, l’Europa continentale e il mondo slavo, autentica sintesi della civiltà europea e per questo degno della massima considerazione e di grande rispetto.",null,0,null,1436885995,null,0,false,0,ct2ymz1,null,t3_3d8lnc,null,t1_ct2ymz1,null,t1_ct2x882,null,null,null,1440480610,null,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3,null

Have you not noticed the shift from in what's generally upvoted ? When Mr. Tsipras rejected the (much lighter) Eurogroup measures and proposed a referedum, the sway in what was upvoted was generally tending to be less sympathetic to the Greek cause. After Mr. Tsipras and his delegation suddenly showed themselves as willing to compromise (probably finally facing the reality of what they would be facing on the background of the banking crisis), and the European Instituions acted needlessly harsh in negotiations, most prevalent opinions here were empathetic towards the Greek people. I rather changed my view too.

In the UK it apparently made [at least £22mil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453451/business), about €32mil. - Now if the average ticket price in the UK wasn't way higher than in Germany, this not only means it made more money in the UK with a smaller population (61mil. in the UK vs. 82mil. in Germany), but it also likely had more visitors, or at least more visitors proportionally to its population.

At the very least saying it made *twice* as much seems quite exaggerated.


&gt; but Germans' love of Mr Bean is one of the things that British travellers to Germany regularly remark upon.

That doesn't sound too unexpected, he's simply well-known and liked, so it's not hard to see why you'd mention him when you meet a british traveller, to show you know and like something about their county of origin. Seems to me like small talk blown out of proportion. Just like not all germans 'love' sushi just because quite a few japanese travellers might hear ""I love sushi"" a lot, I'd imagine.

Austerity is the equivalent of demolishing what is already there, even if not very good and having to surprisingly take down things you thought could  stand but apparently are folding down as well,  with no guarantee that anything will be built. Austerity is not building, is not meant to magically make things grow.

Otherwise, where is recovery ever supposed to come from?

Any nobody knows what will happen if they stay in the EZ under the current program. Thus is life, filled with unknowables. Though when you are faced with the choice between two unknowables, that does not mean you should always choose the one that corresponds with the passive choice.

In the choice between the two completely unknowable alternatives, Alexis Tsipras seems to have wrongly designated one as unthinkable, completely undermining his negotiation position.

I agree, but we should keep in mind that it's a mere difference in degree, not a qualitative difference.

Hätt mir eigentlich gleich klar sein müssen mit wem ich hier rede.

Nochmal für diejenigen die nichts von Wissenschaft halten:

Dein sozial konstruiertes Geschlecht ist sozial konstruiert eben weil Frau und Mann biologisch unterschiedlich sind. Wenn Frau mit Puppen spielt und Mann mit Bagger dann hat das eine biologische Komponente die weit mehr Einfluss hat als die Sozialisation. Die ist nämlich Folge der biologischen Unterschiede. 

Warum hat sich unsere Kultur und Gesellschaft so entwickelt wie sie ist? Nicht wegen der Kultur die vorher schon da war, sondern auf Grundlage der biologischen Gegebenheiten. Dass genau dies dann dazu führt, dass bestimmtes Verhalten auch kulturell gefördert wird ist zwangsläufig. 

Das ist kein Henne und Ei Problem, die Sozialisation, Kultur und all die anderen sozialen Einflussfaktoren waren nicht vor der Biologie da. Das biologische Geschlecht ist kausal für das soziale Geschlecht, das mussten auch die Behavioristen einsehen, die wie die späteren Vertreter der Genderideologie davon ausgingen, der Mensch komme als völlig unbeschriebenes Blatt zur Welt und man könne ihm sein Geschlecht andichten. 

Dieser Quatsch hielt sich viel zu lange und findet auch heute immer noch Anhänger. Zu deren Leidwesen ist es aber unbestritten so, dass es massive Unterschiede im Verhalten und damit dem sozialen Geschlecht bereits zu Zeitpunkten gibt, an denen ein Einfluss der Sozialisation noch ausgeschlossen werden kann.

http://infantcognition.tamu.edu/files/2013/10/Alexander-G.A.-Wilcox-T.-2012.pdf

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12421344

Das setzt sich immer weiter fort. Warum gibt es denn das Gender Paradox? Je mehr dekonstruiert wird umso härter schlagen die biologischen Unterschiede durch. Wie kann das sein wenn an der Gendertheorie auch nur das geringste dran wäre.

Es gab Diskussionen darüber, weshalb es im egalitärsten Land der Welt hinsichtlich Berufsausbildung und Berufswahl größere Unterschiede zwischen den Geschlechtern gab als in anderen Industrieländern. Dies nannte man das ‚Geschlechter-Gleichheits-Paradox’, für das niemand eine Erklärung fand. Man reagierte darauf mit noch größeren Anstrengungen, um endlich die Geschlechtergleichheit zu erreichen. Dieses ‚Paradox’ kann man natürlich leicht erklären, wenn man die Evolutionspsychologie berücksichtigt: Da die Frauen in Norwegen aufgrund des hohen Lebensstandards auch mit ‚weiblichen’ Berufen wie z.B. Krankenschwester ein gutes Auskommen haben, entscheiden sie sich jetzt für Karrieren, die ihren psychologischen Bedürfnissen entsprechen. Aber wenn man so etwas laut sagt, erlebt man wahre Spießrutenläufe.“



Das sagte der Wissenschaftsjournalist Björn Vassnes dazu. 
Die Lüge vom erlernten und verlernbaren wird dadurch nicht besser, dass die Genderideologen Ministerien unterwandern. Natürlich kann man jemanden beibringen ob er im stehen oder im sitzen pinkelt. Genau so könnte man argumentieren Kinder kann man das schreiben mit Rechts oder Links beibringen und es gebe dafür keine Präferenz. Die gibt es aber und es ist irrsinnig die Verhaltensweisen die sich aufgrund der biologischen Unterschiede im Alltag spiegeln ändern zu wollen. 

Und ja, gerade mit Transsexuellen haben Genderideologen ein großes Problem. Die wollen nämlich immer besonders männlich oder weiblich sein. Hackenschuhe, Strapse, alles in Pink. Da kommen dann die Genderfantasten an und wollen denen erzählen die denken sich das nur aus und sollen sich gefälligst weiter wie Männer anziehen, weil das denen ja nur eingetrichtert wird sich wie eine Frau zu kleiden?

Denen, die vom Rest der Gesellschaft oft erklärt bekommen wie unnatürlich es ist als Mann in Frauenklammotten rumzurennen?

Die ganze Genderdebatte ist ein absoluter Witz.

I say propellant depot is obligatory since this will be a permanent colony and studies have shown that in 20 years timeframe a depot centric architecture with smaller launch vehicles could be 57 billion dollars cheaper than a heavy lift architecture. With ESA's annual budget being somewhere around 4.4 billion in 20 years that is 88 billion so 57 billion savings are mandatory. [1](http://images.spaceref.com/news/2011/F9Prop.Depot.pdf)


If used in conjunction with a mining facility on the moon, water or propellant could be exported back to the depot, further reducing the cost of propellant. [2](http://www.sei.aero/eng/papers/uploads/archive/IAC-07-A5.1.03_present.pdf) [3](http://www.spudislunarresources.com/Bibliography/p/102.pdf)


An on-orbit market for refueling may be created where competition to deliver propellant for the cheapest price takes place, and it may also enable an economy of scale by permitting existing rockets to fly more often to refuel the depot. [4](http://www.competitivespace.org/2011/11/04/the-sls-empire-strikes-back/)

Then after a mining and science colony is established the construction of logistical orbital stations like those in Lagrange points will be much cheaper and from Lagrange points with small amounts of *delta v* space agencies can with low cost support colonization and exploration of Solar system. [5](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120001435.pdf)


There are essentially two approaches to refueling a spacecraft in LEO, which can be applied on other depots,


**1.** a single tanker performs a rendezvous and docking with a spacecraft on orbit, transfers fuel and separates, much like an airborne tanker refuels an aircraft.


**2.** many tankers rendezvous and transfer fuel to an in-space depot. Then at a later time, a spacecraft docks with the depot, fuels, and departs Earth orbit.

Both of these concepts **are feasible with current technology**, but in need of significant further engineering development and in-space demonstration.

What we share: A well-functioning economy (except Finland perhaps), EU membership (which is part of why we should join forces), a pragmatic approach to mostly everything (think of the joint effort by Sweden, UK, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Austria, Finland and the Czech Republic to pursue a reduction in the EU budget, and our mutual support for each other's rebates), and already a political alliance on a case-by-case basis (btw ECR members in particular and right-wingers in general are gaining support in these countries). A significant part of the populace being Eurosceptic. Good budget and trade balance. A (generally) common approach to mostly everything

null,false,GNeps,CZEC,"République tchèque, European Federation of Planets",null,"&gt; First I wrote that ""unprepared grexit"" is lunacy. If you found an economist telling that it isn't I would be glad to know.

Economists are saying do a Grexit *now*, so yes, that means prepared as much as it is now. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman being just one example.

&gt; Second I clearly wrote that Chile's GDP got an upswing after Pinochet's fall: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Chile#/media/File:GDP_per_capita_LA-Chile.png[1] Of course it is not a coincidence, dogmatic economic beliefs do not work in the real world.

Either you've got visual impairment or you don't understand graphs. That upswing you're talking about started in 1982, whereas Pinochet was ousted in 1990. And if you knew anything about economic history, you'd knew that the upswing actually started in 1975, the second year Pinochet was in office. That descend you see around 1980 has nothing to do with Pinochet, and everything to do with a global recession triggered by global oil shocks around that date.

&gt; Thirdly, I'm a scientist. Let me say that economics is not thought as the pinnacle of rigour, which is why I find it hardly impressing to hear that someone is an economist, it sounds not much different -to my ears- than (being) a ""political scientist"".

If you really mean such things, my opinion is you're a condescending ignoramus, I don't aim to belittle you, that's just my opinion of how much you thought this through. Economics deals with the most complex problems facing human kind, and it is a science burdened by the fact that one can not do experiments as in physics or chemistry. So saying Economists don't have rigour is completely misunderstanding how the world works. Economics is the one thing that separates the world of plenty we live in today, from the suffering in the kingdoms of the middle ages.

And most importantly, the attitudes of the general population, you included, to the science of Economics, is why we're in such shit to begin with. If anyone asked an Economist if Euro should be established as it was, he'd get only one answer, no matter which Economist he'd ask.

&gt; BTW an unprepared grexit would indeed cause thousands of deaths. For example my father and aunt who are into expensive medication would be some of the first to go, that's not fear mongering, that's a **simple fact** and I just can't bear seeing that man's sly smile while people I love wither and die...

Let's see what a *fact is*: ""A thing that is known or proved to be true."" So no, that's not a fact.  The *fact* is, Greece has stockpiled months worth of medications, so no immediate harm will be done. And don't forget that if Greece really does turn to absolutely shit in the very short term, which is by no means guaranteed, there will be humanitarian aid from the whole of Europe. *No, thousands will not die.*",null,0,null,1436887633,null,0,1436888010,0,ct2zp53,null,t3_3d5xun,null,t1_ct2zp53,null,t1_ct2ylrm,null,null,null,1437845414,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Hey now, you give me more credit and influence than I'm due! The same people who made the Greek RBS 'who supports whom' graphic were the ones to come up with that, or at least the ones who reported on it. 

I had nothing to do with it. In particular, it was in discussion about the Franco-German split and those that aligned to either pole.

&gt; We aren't Germany's little bitch.

Calm down, I make no claims about your country, wherever it is.

&gt; Sending more money to Greece is unpopular in a lot of countries and not just Germany.

I have no argument with this.

&gt; that isn't mentioned in the article so how should I know?

Let's clarify: 3 options. The proposal that Greece submitted, the 1st proposal from Germany (50bn asset fund etc), and the 2nd proposal from Germany, tempGrexit.

I'm not intending to dance around each other with words, right?

So if German option 2 couldn't have been the compromise plan you reference, there logically could only have been 2 other options. The one that got rejected, the Greek plan, and the one that ultimately was chosen, German #1.

German #1 was not a compromise, and I don't think domiciling it Athens makes it a compromise either. 

Thus, the 'compromise' plan is either the Greek plan which was rejected, which means everybody but 3 states supported one of the German proposals, OR, I'm wrong and the 'compromise plan' is actually the German #1 plan based on giving Athens one small concession.

It doesn't matter to me which one is true. It doesn't matter to me whether I incorrectly referred to the package, and you were right.

You cannot reason with these people. They are the reason the situation got much worse for the Greek people in the past weeks.

It's become quite clear that a reasonable leftist social democrat like Mr. Tsipras got held hostage by the extremist wing in his party (Skourletis and Dragasakis, among others in the coalition). And to what end ? The Insitutions' trust in the Greek government is at the lowest point, and this will not benefit the Greek people.

Yet, they want more of the same.

null,false,TalkingHawk,PORT,Portugal,null,"I'll agree with you on the fact that the debt appears to be unsustainable. Greece says so too, and one of their demands was that part of that debt was written off. IMO that should have been done now instead of kicking the can down the road, because that problem will only grow bigger as time goes by.

Glad to hear you're not against bailouts. The problem here is that the conditions that were demanded are counter-productive if the intention is to be able to pay off the debt. It's like you let someone work in freezing cold to pay off their debts but you demand they sell off their jacket first and then complain they can't do any work. Austerity measures shrank the Greek economy and reduced the amount of money they are able to collect through taxes - for example, businesses going bankrupt pay no taxes and increase unemployment, unemployed people not only pay no income tax but they also receive benefits for some time. Less money available for the middle class also means more tax evasion as people need to choose between paying their taxes and eating. These are just economic arguments, I'm not even going to argue about the humanitarian part, because that should be obvious. Increased rate of suicide, increased rate of infant death and death in general as the quality of healthcare in general decreases; I don't think these are acceptable ""side effects"" to pay off the big banks.

Does this really have to be a competition about who has it worse? I concede that there are countries that are worse off than Greece. That doesn't change the fact that the conditions imposed on Greece are more about punishment than they are about money. This is a political issue - stomp down on the leftist government and force them to accept twice as much austerity as they would propose to a right-wing government. Refuse to negotiate until a certain person is removed from the table. Refuse to accept proposals that bring the same income to the ones you propose, if they hurt the big money - like an extra tax on large profits, but instead tax both big and small companies the same way. It's a very clear message to the people: elect politicians who approve of austerity or the same thing will happen to you.

If you're physically present in Spain for more than 183 days (including sporadic absences), you're 'resident for tax purposes' and are obliged to pay tax in Spain on all your worldwide income.

To put that into perspective, on those earnings, in the UK you'd pay 17% of it. 

OP: You're right in that you need an accountant or gestor. I had one but she turned out to be absolutely useless, so I'm also interested in recommendations. 

The tax regime here is ridiculously hostile to entrepreneurs and small businesses. If Spain adopted a UK-type system they'd have millions of people off the paro in a few months, and doubtless loads more taxes being paid to boot.

Last question. Both Θ(1540) and Φ(1860) [which, if I understand correctly, might be (u u s s dbar)] look so much more stable electromagnetically and weak-ly. Does a pentaquark decay strongly into baryon + meson much quicker than electromagnetic or weak effects can kick in?

Qui a dit qu'il était pied-noir ? Un algérien n'a pas un discours incendiaire sur la colonisation française, donc il est de souche européenne ? C'est un algérien de pure souche algérienne (naturalisé français ""automatiquement"" parce que juif, voir Décret Crémieux, mais pas moins algérien depuis des dizaines de générations pour autant), et ça se voit encore sur ma gueule. Je ne prétend expert de la période, mais avoir un grand-père qui te raconte que la France a été loin d'être le pire et a même parfois apporté du positif avec du négatif, ça aide à relativiser le discours manichéen habituel. Regarde la tronche des USA. Regarde la tronche de l'Australie. Regarde la tronche de La Nouvelle Zélande. Regarde la tronche de l'Afrique du Sud. Tu peux dire ce que tu veux, mais il n'y a pas eu de remplacement ethnique ou d'appartheid en Algérie. Je dis pas que c'est bien pour autant, mais bordel, est on obligé de tout mettre sur le même plan et de pas admettre de temps en temps qu'il y a des guerres et des colonisations moins sales que d'autres ?

Ou non, faut vraiment dire que les français ont été aussi horribles que les conquistador, les cowboys et les nazis, tout foutre sur le même plan pour bien dresser les communautés les unes contre les autres ?

&gt;Si tu veux argumenter ta position il te faudra donner des arguments et des exemples plutôt que des platitudes moralisatrices.
Sinon je pourrais me draper dans des exemples comme la Royal Proclamation of 1763 (et son volet sur les droits des Amérindiens) ou la décolonisation pacifique de l'Inde pour donner une vision parcellaire et tronquée de ce que fut la colonisation britannique.

Tu parles de décolonisation, je te parle de colonisation. Je ne vais pas te faire un cours d'Histoire, mais tout le monde sait que la colonisation britannique était une colonisation d'occupation du territoire et de privation des terres aux indigènes (jusqu'à les exterminer), là où la colonisation française était plus douce et avait aussi pour ""mission"" de françiser les indigènes (oui dans l'absolu c'est nauséabond, mais dans les faits c'est plus humain que le modèle britannique, on arrive sur un territoire et on considère les gens qui y sont, on ne les isole pas ou on ne les tue pas comme des merdes).

Le meilleur exemple pour bien comparer, ça reste l'Amérique du Nord (puisque français et anglais y étaient en même temps), et je t'invite à lire les dizaines de thèses sur les relation franco-indiennes à ce sujet (souvent d'Universités québécoises).

Il n'y a pas de débat possible, les français agissaient bien entendus pour leur intérêt, mais considéraient les indiens comme ayant une âme et s'en sont fait de fidèles alliés. Je t'invite à rechercher cette citation d'un historien américain (Francis Parkman) si tu veux en apprendre plus :

null,false,Gibis83,null,null,null,"Comment from a Guardian reader 

Prime minister Alexis Tsipras “didn’t have what it took, sentimentally, emotionally, at that moment, to carry that no vote to Europe and use it as a weapon,” said Varoufakis.


The NO vote ceased to be a weapon the moment Schäuble offered to help organise a managed Grexit. And in his interview from a few days back Varoufakis claimed that he was aware of Schäuble's intentions early on (something about keeping the French and Italians in line). 
Which leads to the question why Mr. Varoufakis ever thought a NO vote would be a weapon for Greece, when he must have known it would instead give Schäuble the ammunition he needed. 
One doesn't have to be a game theorist to realise that Tsipras' negotiation attempt was doomed at that point - and that Varoufakis knew it full well. Yet here he is, telling us Tsipras just ""didn't have what it took"" to use a non-existing leverage.

I never thought I would start pitying the Greek Prime Minister, but right now I do!

Varoufakis said he had not expected a no vote, and suggested neither had Tsipras.

“I had assumed, and I believe so had the prime minister, that our support and the no vote would fade exponentially, but the Greek people overcame fear, they set aside their pecuniary interests, they ignored the fact their savings could not be accessed, and they gave a resounding, majestic no


So, to recap, 
#1 Varoufakis campaigned for OXI, assuming the YES would win. 
#2 He publicly declared he would resign in case of a YES vote, which suggests he wantedto resign. 
#3 OXI won - and Varoufakis made noises about advantageous deals proposed by Brussels, that were ready to be signed, and about banks that would open in the next 48 hours. 
As outlined above, he must have known at that point that Tsipras would go down in flames during the negotiations. 
#4 (Not so) Surprisingly, he then announced his resignation, in spite of having won the referendum, the reason being, so Varoufakis, that the institutions, aka Schäuble, were prejudiced against him, which would have influenced the negotiations negatively.

I can't help but notice, that today's version sounds different, this time shifting the blame to Tsipras who “didn’t have what it took, sentimentally, emotionally, at that moment, to carry that no vote to Europe and use it as a weapon”.
What both versions have in common, though, is the bit about Varoufakis nobly stepping back to give Tsipras' leeway for the negotiations.

My conclusions from 6 months of V.-watching:

#1 He's a proven liar - and not even a good one, because his lies lack consistency.

#2 He tends to shirk responsibility for his actions. His usual modus operandi is shifting blame either to other people's intransigence/stupidity/heartlessness or to the incarnation of all these things, Wolfgang Schäuble.
If that isn't working, he jumps ship and gives others ""leeway"" to deal with the mess, pontificating and criticising from the sidelines.
True to form, we now hear about Mr. Tsipras' failings. No mention about Varoufakis' role in this debacle, though.

#3 An ego the size of Mount Olympus, coupled with an apparently sincere belief that his ex FinMin collegues couldn't stomach him because of his intellectual brilliance on one hand, and because he was the only decent and compassionate person among them on the other.
That's why, right from the start, everyone was against him.
Oh, and of course the complicit media misrepresented him at every opportunity.

# 4 He sure knows how to milk his publicity for what it's worth, so he definitely will do quite well for himself, thanks to his stint in the Greek government. A pity that the same can't be said for his country.

It's good, that he seems to wear others' loathing with pride. He certainly has earned mine!

* they would still need huge funding
* they would still be unable to sustain repayment of that funding without serious structural change
* they would still lack all the basic services and infrastructure to underpin a growing modern economy (they do not even have a national land registry!)
* they would still have most of their economy in the public sector
* they would still need to sharply raise taxes and raise tax collection efficiency to have any enough funds to simply run a government and pay the interest on funding
* they would still need to cut government spending for not just the stronger reasons above (sustainability), but also to remain within the confines of Eurozone and EU fiscal rules - otherwise they expose the economic blocs to future debt-related shocks

The list goes on and on to illustrate quite sharply how little the debt stock itself makes a difference to **what needs** to be done. Obviously, the debt makes a large difference in how fast, how deep and how much non-Greek involvement is present.

I provided you with a  link with a statement from Levada that Putin had disrupted their attempts to tell him that he is substantially less popular than report 3 times.

I'm not disputing that the most recent poll is accurate. I'm stating Putin directly tampers with the polls and the distribution of them, as Levada themselves reports.

Central African Franc is a currency Union of some 15 states. They have never even contemplated transfer payments.

In the US transfer payments are not justified as being an economic necessity of a single currency. It is justified solely on the basis of preventing systemic collapse (FDIC) or for social/political reasons (welfare). In the US it is accepted that the currency creates a level playing field for companies and people, the differences in California and Louisiana lie solely in socioeconomic, political and regulatory fields. No one argues that the xrates are to strong for Mississippi or the interest rates to high for New York, or that Texas is a net exporter, because it does not matter.

*Edit:
What Greeks want from the Euro is a Chimera. They want to be able to import cheaply, but still distort export prices to hide the lack of competitiveness by devaluing. They want to be able to borrow at low interest rates, but if you devalue your currency, the interest rates go through the roof to account for inflation. 

A currency could always be ""tweaked"" to suit the demands of the day, but this has proven to be dangerous and costly. Best way to go is to uncompromisingly aim for stability. This is what the Bundesbank has done in the past, and all countries agreed the ECB should do the same. Now we are fighting about this very principle.

There is a pseudo-faction in the EU parliament that aims for a more federalized Europe. Some steps that have been talked on the media and on Brussels have been:

*  The creation of an European defense army was deemed necessary after the member states realized the inability to react to russian movements during the Ukrainian crisis.
* The same crisis showed that the current bureaucracy involved in the decision making, severely cripples and delays the diplomatic effort by bringing too many interests into the table. A stronger diplomatic body is needed.
* The complete lack of capability of the EU to respond efficiently to the economic and Greek crisis's was evident: the EU had no power to enforce the responsibility on the money it handled to nations, the constitutions of each country collided with the plans the EU made, etc. The EU is (almost) limited to giving the money away and praying the nations use the money wisely. 
* The EU governing body is a mess. They have parlament meetings only twice a month, the over 9000 comissions do recommendations to everyone but can't enforce almost anything, the decision proccess takes ages, the strategies change every 10 years. It's a mess.
* As it is, the EU can't survive, the southern countries economies are collapsing and the new eastern economies will follow the same pattern if the combination ""money injection without supervision"" + ""austerity when shit hits the fan"" is applied on those eastern economies (which is exactly what is happening). Following this pattern, the northern economies will keep loaning astronomic amounts of money to support the peripherals economies forever. And when the next recession hits, god knows what will happens. The southern economies are shattered, the eastern economies are fragile, the western economies are holding but weaker than in 2007 and the northern economies are tired of wasting money on everyone.

In short, the EU needs a change and now is the time to talk. I believe it's too soon to turn  Europe into a federation (which I should say I'm a proponent of), but it's the time to take the next step and address this issues and many more.

Many things are involved on the next step, but all require one common factor:

Not taking into account cultural differences when speaking to an audience made up by outside cultures is certainly a stereotypical American attitude.

&gt;And if the translated word is ""correct"" but the meaning isn't, then that translation isn't, in fact, correct.

That's not right at all.  The reality is that words can have multiple different meanings.  If someone uses a word and it is ambiguous which meaning was meant, it isn't the responsibility for the translator to make assumptions about which definition was intended.  Instead, they should just translate the word directly, and rely on the reader to determine what was the most likely meaning based on the context.

In this case, the context was an interview given to a Western European paper for consumption by a Western European audience by someone educated in Western Europe with a clear understanding of what the word means to Western Europeans.  

In this case, the context would obviously suggest a Western European interpretation of the word.

To pretend that we are wrong for applying this is context is insane.

To go a step past that and say the translator is wrong for not making assumptions about what Tsipras meant and changing the quotes into things he didn't actually say is just down right dishonest.",null,0,null,1436891595,null,0,false,0,ct32gq9,null,t3_3d3xwt,null,t1_ct32gq9,null,t1_ct2u1ad,null,null,null,1437847043,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

For sure, you cannot just come into power and demand things. From that perspective, you are right with your assemsment and EZ are right to slow down Tsippy.

This has been changing only slowly post-reunification and the costs still need to be squeezed into municipal and state budgets.

worse than a society with a rigid, over-centralized, dishonest bureaucracy is one with a
rigid, over-centralized and honest bureaucracy."" (Samuel P. Huntington, 1970's)

Even combating bribery can have negative effects in developing countries.

There are issues with uncertainty though. There's no formal market for bribes, and thus it's impossible for bribers and bribees to come to terms with exactly how much should be given.

And he can hardly be a prime minister without a party... So there'll be a split. I don't think a majority is possible without Syriza, or part of it.

&gt;This statement is just what center and right also think. The day when Syriza leave the office there would be no Greece leftist government for decades imo.

That's why there needs to be a split in Syriza... Tsipras is lost now. If the existing left wants to retain credibility they have to leave or at the very least vote against the terms of surrender, which will mean a split.

Not when the meaning is ambiguous.  The reality is that V. is prone to hyperbole.  This isn't something that is unknown or that I'm just making up.

As such, blindly assuming which of the various meanings he intended is *not* the job of the translator.

Given the context I listed, the interpretation that you are pushing isn't the most obvious or likely.  

Again, when faced with ambiguous meaning, the idea that the translator should ignore the most obvious meaning, pick a less obvious one, and then present different words than what was actually said is just dishonest.

Except that there is a difference in a biased, anonymous poster on reddit and an actual professional.

I'm highly dubious. Listening to Theodoros Pangalos on the radio today(Greeks know him well, for non-Greeks he was once a Pasok big shot) he was asked to describe Syriza and flat out said "" Η μισοί Συριζα είναι τα λαμόγια του Πασοκ!"" -- ""Half of (the makeup) of Syriza are the immoral crooks of Pasok!""

He went into great detail about all the other elements of Syriza, such as Lafazanis and his political/ideological roots, so Pangalos knows what he's talking about (as usual--he may be acerbic and even corrupt but his mind was always razor sharp and knowledgeable).

Tsipras is a conniving cunt. He used the radical parts of Syriza to get the PM seat and will now discard them after his historic capitulation. He flat out lied to everyone, he emptied the funds of everything he could get his hands on, he didn't lift a finger to try and stop capital controls, and now presents this deal as the only way to save the nation from ruin.

Tsipras will now make a government of λαμόγια. The same practices as before will continue. The average Greek will be brought to his knees with these new measures; they will resist the important reforms and ram the shit out of everyone who can't avoid paying taxes.

This new bailout is obviously flawed anyway and bound to fail, so they will use that as cover.

null,false,dukwon,SWIT,Switzerland,null,"&gt; Thank you. Was this specific bound state, or any of its properties (mass?) predicted by any phenomenological model?

Not really. There is something of a ""postdiction"" here (http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06386), but it was biased by someone leaking the result to the author.

&gt; Also, why was this specific pentaquark detected with such a high precision and not the other candidates? Is it a substantially more narrow or stable resonance than the ones that were looked into before?

LHCb has really good statistics for *b*-hadrons. I'm rather certain we have more Bs, Bc and *b*-baryons than any other flavour physics experiment. The detector also has very powerful vertex-finding and hadron identification capabilities.

&gt; Does (d u u c cbar) have ""better"" decay channels than Θ(1540) =? (u u d d sbar)? Less noisy background?

Light-hadron spectroscopy is mess of broad, overlapping states. The light scalar mesons are notoriously difficult to disentangle and interpret. In charmonium spectroscopy, states are narrower and have less overlap. The transition b→cc̅s is tree-level so we can get good statistics. Additionally,  J/ψ→μμ and ψ(2s)→μμ are really clean channels.

&gt; Last question. Both Θ(1540) and Φ(1860) which, if I understand correctly is (u u s s dbar) look so much more stable electromagnetically and weak-ly.

Right, but they were statistical fluctuations and not actual particles.

&gt; Does a pentaquark decay strongly into baryon + meson much quicker than electromagnetic or weak effects can kick in?

That's the only thing we've seen them do.

&gt; If Greece return to its old curreny, they still have debt. They'll print as many drachmes as the'll need to cover that and boom. Inflation and their money is worth nothing. That's no solution either, also because the structual problems will remain. 

Yes, that is a solution, if it were possible to convert to Drachmas that quickly. Which as Varoufakis has said is not possible:

&gt; To exit, we would have to create a new currency from scratch. In occupied Iraq, the introduction of new paper money took almost a year, 20 or so Boeing 747s, the mobilisation of the US military’s might, three printing firms and hundreds of trucks. In the absence of such support, Grexit would be the equivalent of announcing a large devaluation more than 18 months in advance: a recipe for liquidating all Greek capital stock and transferring it abroad by any means available.

Reinickendorf is on the other side of Charlottenburg from both Steglitz and the other side of Tiergarten from Schöneberg, and as far as I can see was never included in the Berlin postal code system. The street address, Haberlandstraße, is in Schöneberg, close to Bayerischer Platz.

I'm wondering, though, where ""Nldf"" doesn't stand for ""Nollendorf"" or ""Nollendorfplatz""; not the name of a town or borough, but the name of an exchange at or near Nollendorfplatz. This would have been in the days before area codes: you would ask the operator for ""Nollendorfplatz 2807"". Given the proximity of the address to Nollendorfplatz, I think it's quite likely.

u/hushami, Steglitz was a village just outside of Berlin, until it was incorporated into Berlin in 1920: it is now a locality in the borough of Steglitz-Zehlendorf.

If you're interested, the two street addresses still exist, if you're curious as to where they are. Here are the Google Maps links:

Despite outright lies that we can point to, he frequently seems to purposely mislead people by using intentionally dishonest word/phrase selection. 

The outcome is that his statements lead to a very clear and obvious conclusion that *isn't* a correct or accurate interpretation of what really happened.  

Then, if called out, he can say ""Well that isn't what I really meant.  You just misunderstood.  I actually meant this instead.""

While he isn't *technically* lying, he is certainly going out of his way to paint a picture that doesn't represent reality.  

You can see hints of this in the passage that you just quoted.

Notice how he starts by saying:

&gt;He would--probably would like to have a federation...

See how he was very careful to go back and add the word ""probably"" in there to give himself cover just in case something comes out later to disprove his claim?  

By adding ""probably"", he can is now free to say whatever negative accusations he wants and can always play it off later as ""well I wasn't for sure about this, so you can't hold me to it.""

The reality is that if you make the types of statements in the quote you laid out, you should certainly be responsible for them.  Simply adding in the word ""probably"" shouldn't absolve you of that.

Additionally, look at the end when he says:

&gt;And, the reason why I'm saying all this, Phillip, is not because I have a theory. It's because Dr. Schäuble has told me so.

Well that seems internally contradictory.  

I mean, he started off by saying ""probably"" and ends by saying that it isn't a theory but something that Schauble told him directly.

If Schauble told him directly, then why would you need to use the ""probably"" qualifier?  It just doesn't make sense.  One of those can't be correct taken at face value.  Since he went back and was careful to make sure that he said ""probably"", it seems unlikely that that is the part that is incorrect, which leaves on the ""Schauble has told me so"" part to be incorrect taken at face value.",null,1,null,1436896241,null,0,false,0,ct35rq6,null,t3_3d8zt7,null,t1_ct35rq6,null,t1_ct31pyd,null,null,null,1437849181,null,-6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-6,null

That is not only because of the wars in the Middle East, but also because there are Pox outbreaks in some of the biggest centers, so the people have to be sent somewhere else for their own safety. Which puts a lot of towns and communities in big distress. But the government in Berlin refuses to help the states, and so the highly debted government of NRW can't help the highly debted city of Dortmund (we even have a spending freeze). Shit runs down hill.

My neighboring town Bochum is considering to construct a temporary camp on a graveyard, others use former finance offices, hospitals, police inspections, youth hostels, churches, Bundeswehr barracks, or, very often, gym halls. In my city alone three are currently out of commission, that's why my sports team has less training times now.

Some months ago, the other neighboring town Schwerte started to convert a former satellite camp of the KZ Buchenwald, which is now finished: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/16/germany-schwerte-nazi-site_n_6487842.html

What bad faith?

I gave the undisputed context the statement was made in.  Here it is again:

&gt;In this case, the context was an interview given to a Western European paper for consumption by a Western European audience by someone educated in Western Europe with a clear understanding of what the word means to Western Europeans.

In that context, interpreting his statements with a Western European meaning is the obvious path.  It isn't operating in bad faith.

The idea that I must have a vendetta because I don't bend over backwards to rewrite his statements in a more conciliatory manner is just insane.

&gt;But yes, those who know the language and its connotations are just biased. 

How else do you explain the fact that they ignored all the context that would suggest that their interpretation is not the correct one?

I mean, it isn't like they addressed it and then said why it wasn't important or didn't matter.  They just totally ignored it.  That is utterly illogical and foolish since context is fundamental to interpretation.

That fact that they ignored it means they are either too stupid to realize context matters OR they are so invested in the alternative that they are basically forced to ingore it.

For example, they do gain multiple advantages in that,

A. if you default with the IMF, the lender of last resort, there is no one else to turn to so forcing you to deal with the original creditors AND the IMF as one

B. they gain the advisory, monitoring and economic expertise of the IMF.

However, this also means that not only are ECB and Eurogroup debts and funding subordinate to the IMF, but also that they are implying they cannot deal on their own with what is strictly an internal problem to the Eurozone. 

That is either an acknowledgement of both the current and future weakness of the Eurozone/EU institutions or a desire to always maintain and codify into law an arms-length relationship between all members of even the Eurozone.

No country would actually have 17 billion on hand for that kind of payment and would normally just borrow 17 billion to pay of the previous debt. This is normal and happens everyday. However in greeces case nobody on the open market is willing to lend them 17 billion because it's likely they won't get the next loan to pay the new debt when it mature the next time.

So the ECB had two choices. Not lend Greece any more money and let them default on their loans (ECB looses money immediately) or lend Greece the money to pay themselves back. (ECB gets payed this time but will have to lend them this plus interest next time around or loose it all again)

You can probably start to see the problem here. 

The majority of the money Greece owes is to the ECB. To keep Greece from defaulting and loosing all of its ""investment"" in Greece it will have to keep lending it more and more money. Except each debt cycle the interest is building up.

It's clear to everyone in this situation that Greece can't afford the loans it has on the books. The longer this goes on the more money will have to be spent to sustain the debt spiral and only makes the inevitable default worse for everyone.

The only viable solution is to ""restructure"" the debt. So they will likely extend out the time between maturities and reduce the interest to 0% on the current debt. Without interest on the loans this will in effect allow any inflation of the euro to reduce the debt. It means the ECB will make a loss on the investment when the debt matures as the value of the loan when it's payed back will be less than the value of the loans when they were first taken out.

A debt restructure is much easier to pass politically than a straight debt haircut. ECB makes a loss but it means Greece isn't stuck in a debt spiral and the ECB has some chance of getting some of the investment back, the only alternative would be a default and everyone losses.

TLDR: some monies are better than no

null,false,marsman,NORN,Northern Ireland,null,"&gt;The point is that all you've described is irrelevant if the economic and fiscal policy of it all is decided in emergency meetings. To pretend there is no policy to be made is, in light of recent events, rather bold.

I suppose I'd ask two questions, the first is whether monetary union has actually delivered significant benefits to all it's members, when compared to those on the outside of the union. Essentially whether the single market is enough (and so you can set aside the massive complications that the Euro provides).  The second is why any state looking at the Euro and the way (as you point out) fiscal policy is bodged on the fly would think it were a good idea to expand that or expand fiscal union outside of it.

Personally I don't care that much about the Euro. I don't think it's that important to the union, and more importantly I'm not sure that the potential risks that accompany it are worth risking the rest of the union. I'd also argue that at present it seems a lot like the Euro is a significant source of bad blood between states. I can't see a terribly great way of dealing with that between sovereign states..

The way these stories have been written in the US, Greece always comes off as stubbornly against embracing debt control measures, a position which their history does not merit. Fingers are constantly pointed by Greece at Brussels, Berlin, Rome, Paris, but seemingly never at Athens.

What plan does the Syriza party have to reform their economy? I have yet to see a rational one. I instead read about how they ""deserve"" debt forgiveness, going so far as to compare their situation to post WWII Germany. How the hell can a country in such a detrimental fiscal position rationally oppose austerity measures at this stage? Increasing sales taxes, reducing pensions, as difficult as they are, are a must when knowing that if they don't their situation will continue to worsen. Yes it appears a certain amount of blame could be dealt to France and Germany for having delayed Greece's collapse so that they could have adequate time to trade their shares in Greece's debt and mitigate their overall loss, but again it's a situation which Greece's corrupt government put them in in the first place. And as sympathetic as I am towards the suffering of the people, Greece simply cannot be trusted at this point to any bailout which they request.

And excuse my rudeness, but Varoufakis comes off as a snake. First he talks about how silence is the best option now that he's stepped down from his former position, and here is immediately throwing his opinion moments after the agreement was reached. Furthermore, I think his position of having the drachma as a contingency plan for the Euro, while not a problem per-say, shows that he was never fully committed to a European agenda.

The measures I referenced earlier that are being proposed make no sense. Why does Greece deserve to be singled out and receive preferential treatment when countries like Ireland, Portugal, Spain, have worked their way through their own crisis? Sure you can argue that Greece's situation is worse, but the favoritism they desire ought not be extended.

Now, in theory they are supposed to be distributed (is there a better phrace for this?

null,false,Pilkenburg,GREE,Greece,null,"Actually, what would have been ""normal procedure"" is that during the first default in 2010, Greece would have had to negotiate with the private holders of the debt (which were private banks) and work something out with them. They would have gone bankrupt then and negotiate with the banks. That's how business and countries usually do it when they go under. 

However, that was not done and there was nothing ""normal"" about what happened next: 

So, instead of the Greeks going bankrupt and negotiating with their private lenders, the Eurozone and the IMF turned around and gave Greece, a bankrupt country, a 300 billion euro loan to cover the international banks that lost money. They put the private losses of the banks onto European taxpayers and in the process shouldered a huge burden on an already bankrupt country. 

Secondly, in the next five years the troika instituted a brutal austerity regime that ENLARGED the debt while at the same time completely throwing the Greek economy into free fall where you now have a humanitarian catastrophe.

So, you had a double whammy of fucked-upness. A country going bankrupt and suffering can be endured if they at least have some sort of recovery on the distant horizon or control over some economic levers. 

However, to be completely drained and then on top of it be in the control of the crazy German-led EU which because of Germany's particular history has an obsession with deflationary policies, no matter what and no matter wether it's appropriate, is crazy. 

In the past five years there was nothing invested in the actual productive economy. The troika didn't even allow Greece to invest in renewable energies. The German led EU is the most fucked up thing ever in terms of actually trying to lead the union out of the crisis. Germans and Schäuble have no positive investment focus at all, it's all about austerity and making it as painful as possible. 

It's basically the lack of any positive leadership, really. So, that's why none of this is ""normal"" and I personally hope Greece vehemently says ""NO"" yet again on Wednesday to the irrational policies of the EU, led by the current German and northern governments and gets AWAY from them. 

The EU under current leadership is absolutely doomed and this disaster with Greece is just the foreplay. From what I have read France would be a much more balanced, sane leader than Schäuble and co.

Germany is not as russophobe as eg. the USA. No one is especially keen on Russia barging in, but I doubt this prospect is enough to change minds. I may also add that Russia has not made any moves yet, so it's still very abstract.

&gt;I don't suppose they put much stock in the argument that Germany has benefited greatly from the Euro while debts pile up in the periphery countries.

No. Conservatives will point you to the laws and rules and tell you ""we play by the rules, if someone else wants something extra, he better have a damn good reason"". German exports are seen as a result of hard work, good government and great entrepreneurs - which is partly true. 

I mean, I try not to be too conservative, but even I would not want everyone in trouble coming over and asking for money just because we have it. At some point, you draw the line.

You may wonder why Merkel and Schäuble were so hung up on the trust issue - but that's exactly where the conservatives are hurt. They feel we are taken for a ride by a country that receives billions per year from the EU cohesion funds, has an abysmal tax honesty, is notorious for brinkmanship and nepotism, has by threatening to block the eastward extension of the EU extorted considerable payments on top of what it already got.

&gt;It's funny because outside Germany Merkel is portrayed as this very powerful ""Queen of Europe"", so it's odd to think she has problems controling her own party.

Conservatives will follow authority, so I don't think they would deny a yes vote. But there's a mortal danger for Merkel's party looming in the next elections. Germany has no credible anti-EU or extreme right party. If Merkel was seen as pissing away the taxpayer's money, such a party would emerge.

null,false,Reilly616,EURO,European Union,null,"No, it doesn't work in that way. I probably should have clarified. Ireland has a dualist system (as opposed to monist). This means that any international treaties we sign bind the State internationally, but do not become binding law internally (that is, national law supersedes them if there is a conflict). This means that individuals cannot use an international treaty as a cause of action against the State. The rationale here is that only the Oireachtas (Parliament) can make legislation, and only the People can amend the Constitution, so if the Government agreed to a treaty, which purported to change Irish law (either ordinary law or constitutional), the Government would be acting ultra vires. 

So, all that said, in order to make the ECHR operational within the state, the Parliament passed the European Convention on Human Rights **Act**, 2003. The nitty gritty is technical, and the ECHR hasn't *directly* been incorporated into Irish law, but for the purposes of this post it's good enough to say that the Act forces all organs of State to act in accordance with ECHR law, and allows the Courts to declare national laws as 'incompatible' with the ECHR.

But that Act is still just ordinary legislation, so the Constitution outranks it. In order for the ECHR to outrank the Constitution, we would have to insert a constitutional amendment to that effect (which is what we did in relation to the EU Treaties).

As to the Courts, they will interpret ECHR law in line with the rulings of the ECtHR, but would be forced to overrule it if it it conflicted with the Constitution. If a judgment of the ECtHR directly contradicted the Constitution, we would have to hold a referendum to change the Constitution if we wanted to follow the ECtHR ruling.

EDIT to reply to your EDIT:

&gt; In France the constitutional court rules on compatibility of the treaty with the constitution before the treaty is signed.

In Ireland, since treaties aren't ordinarily internally actionable, this isn't needed. But, if we were incorporating them in legislation, there is a procedure available for the Supreme Court to check their compatibility with the Constitution. Though that only happens following a request from the President. Thereafter, once the law is operational, anyone with locus standi can bring a case challenging its constitutionality.",null,0,null,1436898911,null,0,1436899557,0,ct37p8q,null,t3_3da1k0,null,t1_ct37p8q,null,t1_ct373lj,null,null,null,1437850532,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

&gt;Ok, ""almost normal lives"" is little bit wrong but at least they arent starving (yet)

40% of pensioners are bellow the poverty line.
30% unemployment.
55% youth unemployment.
4% of the countries population has immigrated in the last 4 years (iirc).
and there's a lot more numbers that tell the story.
It's also going to get worse with the new measures EU forced on Greece.

But I guess it's all irrelevant because not all of them are starving yet... right?

Take education, they rank the UK relatively close to the US when the US dominates education at the college/university level. It isn't even close between the US or UK.

Take culture, they rank the UK a lot closer to the US in terms of culture than any reasonable person would. The US dominates movies,music,tv,online media,you name it,etc.

The issue, from the UK standpoint, was trucks stopping at the tunnel mouth, and would-be illegal immigrants breaking in.

They cannot break into trucks moving at speed.

By creating an area without pedestrians allowed for trucks to wait in, they do avoid the problem.

That is, the theory he holds related to Schauble's desires, motivations, etc... are what he described.

That seems to be explicitly contradicted when he says:

There is a pretty big variety of dialects here. And people have different opinions. Most of my friends dislike the southern dialects, but I find the Kristiansand-dialect to be among the most pleasant-sounding. 

Kristiansand-dialect in a woman is very attractive, in my opinion. Like a British or an Australian accent in English.  


What I think most people agree on is that Trøndersk, the dialect spoken in Trøndelag, sounds fairly atrocious.


Setesdalsdialekt is usually considered very weird. It is almost incomprehensible unless speakers adjust their language. They have weird words that normal people can't guess and grammatical constructs that are not used in regular Norwegian, like epenthesis, conjugation for numerals, and genitive.  

There are different dialects in Northern Norway, as well. They can often be hard to understand. 


[Here is a clip from a comedy show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62Xgnx0oy-Q), where they show a news clip from somewhere in Trøndelag. I personally can't understand anything that the guy being interviewed is saying. He's from [Sula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sula,_S%C3%B8r-Tr%C3%B8ndelag).


Isolated places like that and Setesdalen, which did not have much contact with the rest of the country developed weird dialects. I knew a guy from Lierne once. It's a completely different part of the country, but also pretty far away from civilisation. His dialect took several weeks of getting used to. It was just so weird. 

Gudbrandsdalsdialekt is also a commonly known weird dialect. Unlike Setesdalsmål and Lierne-dialect It's still perfectly understandable for most Norwegians, though.

&gt; Jew in any Suburb/major city in Europe.

Yes, I am one of those people that dismissed the video of a Jew walking in Paris because there is nothing outrageous there. In the Russian video there were physically attacked twice and constantly insulted. One ""homo"" and four ""jew"" in four hours is really not comparable. If the video proves anything is that the European population apparently has nothing against Jews, and the Muslim immigrants are maybe unfriendly but there have no obligation to like Jews.

&gt; because mild, pervasive antisemitism is totally OK because Muslims aren't adults that should be held accountable for their vile actions

They totally should! Let's do it right now! Since I'm not french please cite what are the penalties in french law for:

* calling a Jewish person on the street ""Jew"" (4 offenders)

* calling a person ""homo"" (1 offender)

* saying that a person has come to fuck or whatever that was (1 offender)

* spitting (2 offenders, I guess it could be considered littering)

* giggling (1 group of 4 offenders)

* following a person on for 2 streets (1 offender)

Those are vile, *vile* actions. Let's make them pay for it.

&gt; (explains the child-abuse worshipping, every single Islamist country being a shit-tier hellhole, a single Nobel prize among all Muslims, etc.)

Out of topic, not in the video, meaningless and a whole different discussion. I could bring up the thousands of civilians Israel kills every few years, but what's the point?

&gt; Just answer a single question; do you think the behavior of said arabs is in any way acceptable?

Depends what do you mean by acceptable. Most of them are legal, so yes, it is ""acceptable"". You can go and lecture them about respect, but can't do much more. Or outlaw spitting and giggling.

* Are they in bad taste? Most of them, sure.

* Are they crimes? Most of them, not at all.

So you can go ahead and stop saying that people are ""acting like savages"" and commiting ""vile actions"" when they are barely bothering the guy from a distance during a 10 hour walk through some problematic areas of a big city. You see way worse things on every football match and no one is calling all Christians ""hooligans"".

That's not what i'm saying. You seem to have missed my point.

I'm pointing out the distinction between a supposed federal model which Varoufakis believes Schauble wants, and the reality of the situation (according to Varoufakis). 

&gt;It can't be both.

Varoufakis is referencing separate models.

&gt; If he is, then he is wrong to say that it isn't a theory.

The theory is that he believes Schauble wants a federal model but is unable to procure such a model, given political circumstances. Thus, the model he supposedly told Varoufakis of is a distinct model from the one you are referring to. Hence, the use of the word ""probably"".

Need me to post it again?  No problem.

&gt;In this case, the context was an interview given to a Western European paper for consumption by a Western European audience by someone educated in Western Europe with a clear understanding of what the word means to Western Europeans.

What are you missing?

&gt;Any translator with any understanding of the language would understand he didn't mean literal bombs terrorism

I didn't say he meant it literally.

My belief is that he meant ""bombs terrorism"" and was using that meaning as a form of hyperbole.

&gt;  and I know you think this is somehow impossible, but using context to figure out the most likely meaning of a word is the main part of a translator's job. 

...and the most likely meaning *based on the context* is that he was using ""bombs terrorism"" as a hyperbole.

&gt;I ask you again, have you ever translated anything, especially dialog, literature, or poetry.

Sure.  I don't reject the obvious context it was written in so that I can translate it in a way to make the author look better.

Do you?

&gt;You mean dismissing the actual definitions of the Greek words as somehow being biased?

Let's try this.  

What word did he use in Greek?

If he meant ""bombs terrorism"", would the word he used have been incorrect?

Also, I haven't dismissed that it *can* mean other things.  I'm simply dismissing the idea that the context implies those other meanings.  I'm also dismissing the idea that we should ignore the context so that we can make V. look better.

&gt;You're literally ignoring the context of the dialog itself...

Support that.  

What context did I ignore?  I don't ignore that, to a Greek audience or in a Greek forum, it could be interpreted differently.

My stance is just that in:

&gt;an interview given to a Western European paper for consumption by a Western European audience by someone educated in Western Europe with a clear understanding of what the word means to Western Europeans.

blindly assuming that we should interpret is as if we were Greek and it was for a Greek audience is utterly stupid.

&gt;And again. lmao

Yet you offer no reason as to why the context that I've listed a half dozen times wouldn't be the correct one to apply.

Seriously, let's just match them up and see.  Here is the context that nobody disputes:

&gt;the context was an interview given to a Western European paper for consumption by a Western European audience by someone educated in Western Europe with a clear understanding of what the word means to Western Europeans.

Based on that context, the Western European interpretation seems to be the obvious one.

What is your case for why we should use the Greek interpretation?

Notice the use of the word *all*.

If he meant to say that one model was has beliefs and one model was based on what he was told directly, then you certainly don't use the word *all*, since that implies that *both* models were explicitly told to him by Schauble.

&gt;The theory is that he believe Schauble wants a federal model but is unable to procure such a model, given political circumstances.

But he said:

&gt;And, the reason why I'm saying **all** this, Phillip, is not because I have a theory.

If part of it is a theory and part is based on explicit claims from Schauble, then it is wrong to use the word *all*.

Drehen wir das doch mal um, schick mir doch einfach mal Studien die der wissenschaftlichen Methodik entspricht, ein Peer-Review sowie die Publikation in einem anerkannten Medium erfahren haben und die ganz klar belegen was du hier behauptest. 

Ich habe überhaupt keine Thesen aufgestellt, die ich mit Studien belegen müsste (falls du das anders siehst: welche?). Dass es ein „soziales Geschlecht“ gibt, hast du ja selbst eingestanden. Leider haben deine weiteren Ausführungen zum Thema gezeigt, dass du überhaupt nicht weißt, was mit „soziales Geschlecht“ und „Konstrukt“ gemeint ist. Konstruktiv habe ich dich auf deine Fehler hingewiesen und dir zwei Zitaten mit auf den Weg gegeben. Angesichts der Tatsache, dass du hier andere als „Irre“ bezeichnest und eine nicht mal näher definierte Position als wissenschaftlichen Konsens verkaufen willst, war meine Intervention natürlich mehr als angebracht. Im Idealfall gehst du aus unserer Unterhaltung schlauer raus. Dazu musst du aber auch versuchen, meine Aussagen zu verstehen (und ggf. nachfragen) und dabei auf Unterstellungen verzichten. 

&gt;Dein sozial konstruiertes Geschlecht ist sozial konstruiert eben weil Frau und Mann biologisch unterschiedlich sind

Nochmal: „Soziales Geschlecht“ bezeichnet die geschlechterspezifischen Verhaltensweisen, Einstellungen und Fähigkeiten, die sich **nicht** kausal aus der Natur oder Biologie ableiten lassen. Das ist nicht „mein sozial konstruiertes Geschlecht“, sondern schlicht die Bedeutung des Begriffs. Ist das beim zweiten Mal Lesen klarer geworden? Das ist keine ideologische Position meinerseits sondern eine analytische Kategorie.

Solltest du allerdings sagen wollen, dass Verhaltensweisen, Einstellungen und Fähigkeiten oftmals fälschlicherweise z.B. als sozial oder kulturell bedingt bezeichnet werden, kann man das natürlich an Hand von Beispielen klären. Das ist allerdings eine neue Fragestellung.

&gt;Wenn Frau mit Puppen spielt und Mann mit Bagger dann hat das eine biologische Komponente die weit mehr Einfluss hat als die Sozialisation.

Das ist tatsächlich ein hochinteressantes Thema und ich würde dir die Lektüre der folgenden Studie ans Herzen legen:

&gt;Regarding within sex differences, as opposed to differences between boys and girls, both boys and girls preferred dolls to cars at age 12-months. The preference of young boys for dolls over cars suggests that older boys' avoidance of dolls may be acquired. Similarly, the sex similarities in infants' preferences for colors and shapes suggest that any subsequent sex differences in these preferences may arise from socialization or cognitive gender development rather than inborn factors. ([Jadva, V, Hines, M., &amp; Golombok, S. \(2010\) Infants’ preferences for toys, colors and shapes: Sex differences and similarities. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 39, 1261-1273.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20232129))

Auch sonst ist bekannt, dass Sozialisation eine große bei der Vorliebe von Kindern für bestimmte Spielzeuge spielt, dass dies schädliche Folgen für die Entwicklung von Kindern haben kann, dass die Unterscheidung von Spielzeug nach Geschlecht immer stärker wird, dass Marketing-Erwägungen dabei eine große Rolle spielen - aber auch, dass das biologische Geschlecht Verhaltensweisen beeinflussen kann. Deine Erklärung solcher Verhaltensmuster ist jedoch zirkelschlussartig, da es dir nicht gelingt, soziales und biologisches Geschlecht getrennt voneinander zu betrachten. So wird jede Beobachtung zu ihrem eigenen Beleg - als ließe die Beobachtung, dass Jungs lieber mit Baggern spielen, keinen anderen Schluss zu, als den, dass in den Genen von Jungs gespeichert ist, dass sie Bagger mögen. Dabei ist Spielzeug gerade ein gutes Beispiel dafür, wie Geschlechterrollen Kinder beeinflussen. Falls dich das Thema weiter interessiert:

So that wasn't the context?  I wasn't in:

&gt;an interview given to a Western European paper for consumption by a Western European audience by someone educated in Western Europe with a clear understanding of what the word means to Western Europeans.

I pretty sure that it was, but I look at any evidence you want to share.

&gt;You know, the actual dialog?

Yes, dialog in:

&gt;an interview given to a Western European paper for consumption by a Western European audience by someone educated in Western Europe with a clear understanding of what the word means to Western Europeans.

I'm quite aware of the context and embrace it as part of my stance.

&gt;I have in pretty much every post

That's not true.  There is a difference is saying:

&gt;You know, the actual dialog? That context matters more than your supposed targeted audience (which is a reach, at best).

And actually saying ""why"" you feel that way.

For instance, it is one of the papers of record in Spain, a major Western European country.  ""Why"" is it a reach, at best, to say his target is Western Europeans?

&gt;but it's funny how all your other arguments have disappeared as they've been addressed.

Addressed, or addressed with actual logic or evidence?

If you mean the second one, than that's not true, but feel free to quote specifics if you want.

&gt;You're literally ignoring the actual dialog as context.

Not at all.

I asked what word in Greek was used in the dialog and what word he would use in the dialog if he meant ""bomb terrorists"" as hyperbole.

That certainly is about the dialog.

Sure I do.  If your stance is that they are just homonyms, then present the different words he would use as well as there pronunciations and let's go from their.

&gt;Well, since Tsipras is defending the agreement - and has explicitly steered towards it against the result of the referendum he called himself - he has to drink that chalice to the last drop. And he can hardly be a prime minister without a party... So there'll be a split. I don't think a majority is possible without Syriza, or part of it.

Maybe this is the time to remind on those 251 (of 300) votes in parliament he got for his last proposal. That proposal, afaik, isn't so much different then this that has agreed on.

So, if he has got support of more then 100 others' MPs for that proposal, I could even think of him now to have a bigger support in Greece now then after he announced a referendum.

&gt;&gt;This statement is just what center and right also think. The day when Syriza leave the office there would be no Greece leftist government for decades imo.

&gt;That's why there needs to be a split in Syriza... Tsipras is lost now. If the existing left wants to retain credibility they have to leave or at the very least vote against the terms of surrender, which will mean a split.

*Retain credibility* in this situation, imo, is just washing hands and playing the ball to others who will be ready to take responsibility.

I know that has been the *spirit of leftist pragmatism*, but if they know and trust opposition would make same old bad moves if they take the office, then keepimg the office should be Syriza primary goal right now.

Many people are livid. Why do you think so several countries have been pushing for grexit last weekend?

The reason why they agreed on another bailout is that keeping the Eurozone intact is valuable in itself. And because nobody wants to be the chancellor/PM who is responsible for breaking the EZ.

But as we have seen not at any price. This time came pretty close, and it's still not certain if the bailout will happen.

&gt; allowing the wealthier nations to remain in a currency union that gives them a depreciated currency, in comparison to their previous ones, which continues to benefit them in the export market and thus remain on the steady upswing in GDPs.

that's a pretty lame conspiracy theory, IMHO doesn't make much sense. Greece is small. If the Germans, or rather the EZ overall wanted to, they could enable the ECB to maximize growth (as the American Fed does) instead  of maximizing stability -- which would mean a weaker Euro, higher inflation. Greece would benefit from a weaker Euro too. Germany doesn't want a weaker euro, quite the opposite, Germany wants to minimize inflation.

Sure, but is it worth it to spend many bn of EUR just to keep the pressure on Putin? I think I know your answer, but some might disagree. At the worst, Merkel loses some face and tells everyone ""I tried, but I am not almighty""

&gt;You've got to be honest and say that having a massive surplus in a currency union is a one-sided deal.

No need to tell me, the quoted opinion is not mine.

Conservatives will tell you ""we made it, so why can't they"". They only see that Germany pays handsomely into the EU's coffers and do not recognize that streamlined regulation, the lack of floating exchange rates, lack of taxes and aligned laws made that success possible.

&gt;we're past the point of punishment and into vindictivness - the comparisons to Versailles are not unwarrented.

Again, I won't argue that, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d3xns/eursummit_statement_on_greece_20150712/ct1juca). I mean, technically the Versailles-comparison is bullshit, because that treaty also prevented Germany from having an army, but as an approximation it is valid.

Unfortunately a lot of conservatives are just happy Greeks now have their comeuppance. Like it's some soccer match where you can cheer if your team routs the others.

&gt;I think that Syriza could have been (maybe still can) be the best chance of a reforming government simply because they are not part of the old network of corruption.

I doubt that. They have no consistent program for modernizing Greece (no matter how your ideological point of view, Greece needs a lot of business-friendly changes if you want it to thrive), they have started with their own form of nepotism (giorgos tsipras) and have not gone after the guys on the Lagarde list. Maybe to potami would be better, I have no idea.

null,false,Nilbop,IREL,Ireland,null,"&gt; Offering a seat to a successor state of the Soviet Union and a nuclear superpower is anything but a favor or a gesture of goodwill. 

Russia was essentially a gangster state after the failure of the USSR, which it was primarily responsible for. But for investment from the West it would have been even worse off. It's army disintegrated with rogues selling off armaments left right and centre, it's economy was a disaster, and the best politician they got out of it was a KGB Colonel who failed to diversify the economy of the country with the greatest natural resources on earth. The West was under no obligation to offer the loser of the Cold War anything. They were given a hand for increased dialogue and cooperation, which they then spat upon with militaristic jingoism, which they now complain about. 

&gt; It's like a mobster saying ""I could have taken everything from you, stripped you of every possession, but chose to spare a pair of pants, be grateful"" - except that mobster at least isn't really expecting you to be grateful.

Russia was, and is, owed nothing. It's former allies and satellites detest it. It's resources are under-utilized. It's government is run by *vors* and KGB Colonels, just like it was under the USSR. The Soviet Union self-destructed; Russia was not robbed, it through it's clothes to the wind.

The idea of Russian exceptionalism is staggeringly arrogant. You were virtually a failed state - rapproachment with a former enemy is something a rational person should be grateful for.

&gt; Everyone have agreed to introduce Russia into Security Counsel not out of the goodness of their hearts, but simply because they were scared of the consequences of not doing so. 

See what I mean?

This doesn't gel with your idea of ""mobsters robbing Russia"" at all. NATO could have quite easily dismantled what remained of the RuFed after the fall of the Soviet Union, when your generals and politicians were busy fighting and robbing each other and the country at large. They didn't, because they are better than you. They sought stable, successful partners, not idiotic ideas of empires, buffer states and border lands. There's a reason West Germany was superior to East Germany in every way. There's a reason Poland is doing so much better under the EU than under the Warsaw Pact. 

You were, and are, no threat. The sooner you realize your impotence the better.

&gt; Soviet Union collapse was pretty bad and messy as it was.

It's like, in the very early 20th century people that that in the UK we would have the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party as our two major parties forever (we'd had just those two for about two hundred years at that point). Then, suddenly, in the 1930s the Labour Party sprouted up and the Liberal Party disappeared. No one really saw it coming, simply because it had been like that for so long, but when you look back with retrospect, you can see that it was basically inevitable. 

Women's votes is a similar story.

Irish Home Rule is also similar. 

Devolution for Scotland and Wales was similar (1998)

Nobody predicted that these things would happen until right before they did. The UK's demonstrated that, when it really needs to, it can change suddenly and radically in order to preserve itself. 

What's more, because of devolution to London, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, there's actually already a lot of very proportional systems that the UK already uses. For instance the Scottish system is called a Mixed-Member systems where you have a nation-wide party list (which is the most PR system you can get) and a traditional consistency you vote as well. So that you have 50% nationwide Members of Scottish Parliament and 50% constituency MSPs. 

The same system could very easily be adopted for UK Parliamentary elections. 

So I'm very hopeful for change. I think that the support is really there, and all we need to do  is keep pushing and pushing and before long it'll snap.

null,false,rimorot,null,null,null,"The bad acting in Germany is legendary. I think it's part of the culture. As an actor who has lived in the states and now in Germany, I have noticed that really coming out of your skin and putting it out there, something which is natural in the states, is sort of frowned upon here. Actors and the culture are just SO uptight in this particular way. ""Being real"" means that you can fully share joy, laughter, scorn, whatever. German actors really hold back in all these departments with one big exception: anger. Anger and shouting is one of the few emotions that is allowed to be genuinely shown. You see that in TV plays a lot. The more subtle or even joyous emotions are portrayed in a very bland, colourless way but when it comes to anger and shouting, that is allowed. 

You can also see this in the case of Christoph Waltz. I watched him in an episode of ""Tatort"" just before he got to work with Quentin Tarantino. In the TV show he, like everyone else, was extremely dull and colorless. None of the flair, the charisma or enthusiasm of the Tarantino film was apparent. You get made fun of as a German actor if you show too much enthusiasm or joy. It's just not done and if people try to do it, they have to do it in a hamfisted way because inside they know they'll be made fun of. It's really sad. There is a certain ""looseness"" missing a certain authenticity. However, the moment Waltz worked with Quentin on his set and was ""allowed"" to really be himself and show everything, voila, you have a Germanic actor that's great. It's the emotional culture that holds actors back, not the actors' skills. In fact, German actors are some of the most professional and well trained actors in the world. The education system here is excellent. It's just that there is a ""little something"" missing.

Quentin Tarantino even hinted of this when he spoke about fruitlessly trying to audition for Waltz's part. He felt like most actors he saw in Germany just didn't really go out of themselves. There was a playfulness missing, which I think is the bottom-line in all of this : There is a certain playfulness missing. I harken it back to the cultural need of repressing ""bad"" or ""weak"" emotions. The Brits also have that, that's why they are also legendary for being rigid. When it comes to emotions, though, the problem is that you can't just clamp down on the ones you consider ""bad"". If you try to do that, then you repress everything the bad and the good feelings and life just becomes grey and dull emotionally and I think culturally that's sort of what's happening in terms of standard German acting.

My advice for all German actors if I could snap my finger: dare to be crazy and playful. That's ironically the key to displaying ""serious"" emotion as well. I think there is this totally false notion in Germany that if you're playful and silly, that's not ok or it's only for comedies. In fact, precisely that ability to show silliness opens the door to the deeper stuff as well. As a famous acting teacher said : ""BE crazy!"". Don't have these ever-present self-consciousness of being ""too enthusiastic"" or ""too playful"". Self-consciousness is the enemy of the actor. 

A final point: Since the attitudes of actors are also shared by writers, you understand why not only the acting but also the writing is missing. Screenwriting and acting are very much connected and it's no coincidence that both of these things are suffering under these cultural, emotional rules.

null,false,watabadidea,null,null,null,"&gt; The ""all"" refers to the previous paragraph in which he explains the distinctions between the model Schauble is proposing, and the one Varoufakis thinks he wants. In essence, it's has nothing to do with what Schauble ""probably"" wanted. It has everything to do with what he supposedly told him.

The why use the word ""all"" at all?

I mean, there is literally one sentence between:

&gt;He would--probably would like to have a federation, but he feels that he doesn't have the political power to create one.

and:

&gt;And, the reason why I'm saying all this...

If he really just meant for *all* to refer to that one single sentence, then it seems redundant to say it.  He could just have said:

&gt;And, the reason why I'm saying this...

The fact that he used the word **all** suggests, on the face, that he meant to refer to the entire answer, not just one single sentence.

At this point, I think you've pretty much proven what I said from the start.  My initial claim is that V. says things that give one clear impression on its face.  However this impression is not accurate and is dishonest.  However, he is very careful about his word choice to leave a defense if he is ever called out on it.

I mean, ""all"" means ""everything"" or "" the entire amount or quantity"".  On it's face, ""all"" refers to ""everything"" he just said, not just the one single sentence previous.

Now when called out, you want to apply a very limited and illogical meaning of the word ""all"" that completely changes the meaning.  

I mean, if it doesn't mean ""everything"" anymore, how do we even know that it refers to the entirety of the previous sentence?  Maybe ""all"" just refers to most of the previous sentence.  Maybe it refers to half of the previous sentence.  Maybe it refers to 5% of the previous sentence.

Seriously, once ""all"" no longer means ""everything"", how exactly do you determine what was told to him and what wasn't?

&gt;No, that's not what he is saying.

Well it certainly is what he said.  The definition of ""all"" is pretty clear.

&gt;As a matter of fact, in no way did he say this was all told to him by Schauble.

What?  Are you crazy.  Let's check this by putting this side by side with his quote:

&gt;As a matter of fact, in no way did he say this was all told to him by Schauble.

&gt;And, the reason why I'm saying **all** this, Phillip, is not because I have a theory. It's because Dr. Schäuble has told me so.

Seriously man, you are losing it.

&gt;At this stage, you're just being pedantic to spite the man.

This is too rich.  You've redefined the word ""all"" to mean ""some"".

Meanwhile, ""some"" is literally an *antonym* of ""all"".

[Opinion: Krugman's mistake](http://www.dw.com/en/opinion-krugmans-mistake/a-18113035)

&gt;You're not the first person to accuse our companies of exporting too much while Germans consume too little. Nor are you the first to criticize the fact that our unbalanced trade deficit is swelling to a precarious level. Germany has had to listen to such accusations for a while now, whether from the IMF, the US Treasury Secretary or its European neighbors.  But these accusations don't ring truer the more they are repeated.

Tatsache ist, das Griechenland schon seit den 80er Jahren konstant eine negative Handelsbilanz hat, und das nicht nur mit Deutschland. Ebenso gibt es auch Länder, die viel mehr von Griechenland kaufen als sie selber von dort beziehen, und damit die Bilanz insgesamt verbessern.

[Eine detaillierte Aufschlüsselung findet sich hier](https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/grc/) 

Ebenso lassen die Vertreter der ""Beggar-thy-neighbor""-These außer Acht, daß durch die EU-Agrar-, Regionalentwicklungs- und Kohäsionsfonds jedes Jahr Milliardenbeträge nach Griechenland fließen.   Von denen Deutschland als Netto-Zahler einen bedeutenden Anteil trägt. 

Die Importe Griechenlands haben in der Euro-schuldenfinanzierten Boomphase von 2000 bis 2009 allgemein stark zugenommen, von allen Handelspartner, z.B. auch Russland. Umgekehrt gehen die Export Deutschlands in die Eurozone seit Jahren zurück, während die Bedeutung von Asien und Osteuropa zunimmt.

Zum Ausgleich mehr aus Griechenland importieren wäre schwierig für eine Industrienation wie Deutschland, weil dort kaum Waren hergestellt werden, die hierzulande benötigt würden. Z.B. sind 34% der griechischen Export verarbeitete Erdölprodukte - die BRD kauft typischerweise Rohöl und raffiniert es im Inland. 

Das zweitwichtigste Produkt sind Medikamente, an deren Herstellern es aber hierzulande nicht fehlt. 

Insgesamt ist das Handelsvolumen ohnehin nicht sehr groß: Deutschland importierte von Griechenland für$2,176,607,458.97, und exportierte $5,738,776,682.35.

What it quotes is an article dating back to 2003, that has absolutely nothing to do with recent polls conducted by 'Levada', or, as the matter of fact, any other their poll, because it is an elaborate explanation on why did they (Levada himself and a major part of his employees) decide to quit VTsIOM for a new independent polling organization (under the same name).

What it quotes is Levada himself, stating that back then (in 2003 and earlier) polls have been systematically used as a weapon AGAINST Putin, and that he, Levada, had personally prevented three attempts to *scare Putin into submission* by artificially lowering poll results, to make him believe that his real social support was minuscule (which was not):

&gt; Согласно этой версии, ВЦИОМ мешал не завышать, а занижать показатели, говорящие о стабильности президентского положения. Левада рассказал, что он не менее трех раз вмешивался в ставшие ему так или иначе известными попытки напугать президента рассказами о том, что «на самом деле» (по данным опросов ФАПСИ и ряда иных агентств) его поддержка в обществе ничтожна. 

(That's what it says, check with google translate if you may, feel free to ask me if something seems weird.)

Moreover, author goes far as to admit that 'unlike the Yeltsin regime, current administration is, in fact, using popular support and rating as a leverage in power disputes', adding that convincing the president that he does not have any support (which, again, according to Levada would be a lie) could help brokering some hard bargains.

&gt; Левада далее не углублялся в описание ситуации, но мне кажется, что умысел здесь понятен: нынешняя президентская власть, в отличие от ельцинской, действительно, в значительной мере опирается на этот «рейтинг» как ресурс во взаимоотношениях с различными группировками при дворе. Если эту власть убедить, что никакой народной поддержки у нее нет, это заставит ее принять жесткие предложения тех, кто силу народной любви предлагает заменить собственной силой.

And even more so, the very same article you've referring to *dismissed and ridiculed* the idea that it was Putin who was tampering with polls and pollers, interfering with results:

&gt; Но вернемся к вопросу: кому мешал ВЦИОМ?

&gt;Наивные люди говорят: президенту РФ. Еще более наивные спрашивают: чем? Из месяца в месяц центр публиковал знаменитые, пресловутые «рейтинги». (Из прессы последних недель ясно, что именно их все заинтересованные стороны считали «настоящими».) Есть версия, что, мол, «они» готовятся к тому, что рейтинг начнет падать. Тогда-то, мол, ВЦИОМ помешает это скрыть.

&gt;Сложновато. И ВЦИОМ в своих прогнозах никакое падение не предсказывал. Напротив, информировал, что тенденция считать, что «настоящий лидер у нас всего один», становится все более выраженной.

Concluding:

The problem is more with the money already lended than with the new one. So we, the French, weren't going to give money to the Greeks for them to give it immediately to the Germans. I'm against austerity because I feel this is acting like a mafia. Stop eating and give me the money you don't even have anymore. There were a lot of better option which could have been different than just gifting money to the Greeks. But because Mr Schäuble thought he was the keeper of Europe righteousness and vertu, he didn't want to hear anything else than the his point of view. 

To your question are we along with Merkel, I think this is a non question. Like asking to a Republican why he chose to go along with Obama. I still have hope for a deep reforming of European institutions though, to strengthen people power, and thus, fraternity.

Classic.  I ask you to do multiple things.

You respond with:

&gt;I have,

with no actual details of which thing I asked of you that refers to.

Then when I directly ask:

&gt;Have what?
 
you refuse to answer and instead accusing me of setting up strawmen.

Pretty disingenuous on your part, but about what I expected.

&gt;I said ignoring the context in the text and claiming an intended audience as being the only context is a reach.

No, you said:

&gt;That context matters more than your supposed targeted audience (which is a reach, at best).

""Which is a reach, at best"" can either refer to ""supposed targeted audience"" or it can refer to the entire rest of the sentence.

If it refers to the entire rest of the sentence then you are saying that *your* claim of:

&gt;That context matters more than your supposed targeted audience

is a reach at best, effectively admitting that you are reaching to make your claim.

Alternatively, you are saying that ""supposed targeted audience"" is a reach at best, which is what I called on you to support.

So which is it?  Do you admit that *your* stance is a reach at beast?  Or were you claiming that my stance that the target audience being Western Europeans was a reach, at best?

If you say the former, then you are shitting on your on argument.

If you say the latter, then you are lying when you say that I set up a strawman. 

Seriously man, this shit isn't that hard.  Watching you melt down trying to stay consistent is pretty sad.

&gt;That was discussed in the thread you claim to have read.

So you claim.

&gt;Nope, you're just too biased or stupid to do much other than copy and paste a sentence over and over again.

Funny that you can't actually support this though.  You just have to make claims about it being in other threads and make up lies about what you said earlier even though it is black and white.

This is a key point. For example, privatizing the electricity network sounds like a crime to me. You'll be giving a monopoly to one corporation which probably will spend less in maintaining it and will give them a competition advantage if they also pair it with power supplying.

There is also OTE(hellenic communications organization). Before it was privatized there was a ""renovation"" plan for the Greek network(optical fibre) which after the privatization was scrapped as a private owned company only looks on how to maximize its profits.

&gt; A google search for 'top universities in the world' has the UK ranking 4/10 of the top 10 on the first site I checked. 

Instead of saying you did something, why not post the link to your site and back up your comment? And the top 10 is quite arbitrary isn't it? What about top 5? What about top 20? Top 30? Top 40? Top 100? 

&gt; Considering the US has a significantly larger population I think that is pretty decent.

On a per capita basis, US universities dominate as well. But we aren't talking per capita, we are talking about overall. 

&gt; And culture? The UK has always dominated in music. Films and TVs, well I dunno.

The US created hip hop,techno,rock 'n roll, jazz, blues, etc. We created entire new genres. There have been great british musicians, but the US dominates world music, movies and tv. 

&gt; Most of the American shows and films I see seem to have quite a few Brits popping up in leading roles.

Just because a brit is in an american movie doesn't mean it is british. Batman is still an american movie even if christian bale played the role.

&gt; And lets not forget the BBC.

Are you kidding me? BBC vs hollywood... Right...

All the things you mentioned (kissing, hugging, lil' butt squeeze, arm around waist while walking) are totally normal in most countries. I don't understand why you think you have to explain that touching someone you are attracted to is pleasurable, or that having a beer and going for a walk is fun.

When you are an adult and you start passionately making out with your significant other, or passionately hooking up with someone you just met, at a certain point (like after a couple of minutes, not 30 min. to an hour or more like the people you will see here) you decide ""Ok, let's go home. Because I'm tired of playing around and I want to get dirty.""

And so, that's what you do. You leave and you go have sex in a bed. Or in the hall on the way to the bedroom, or on the floor or bending over a sofa or whatever. But you do that in a home. That home is usually not your parents' home. And if you live in your parents' home, then you usually can't do those things. See how that works?

You can talk all you want about how Spanish people like going out and how they ""live outside"", but that has nothing to do with this question. And if it does, then it only tells me that Spanish people are kind of silly. If you and the other guy are saying that Spanish people would rather stay outside doing something juvenile like making out, when they should be at home fucking tells me that you are not actually passionate at all and that you have your priorities all wrong.

Besides, I'm not sure you read OP's other post in this thread, but when they say ""PDA"" what they mean is not kissing and petting. They mean having sex in cars in public view. I don't care what you say about culture or attitudes, the only reasons that people regularly have sex in cars is that they either have a specific fetish about cars, or they don't have anywhere else to go.

They certainly store a lot of information. But they filter out most of the junk first with lots of computational wizardry.

It's not simply putting it in a histogram, they only look at things they are interested in. (I don't know how)
They use magnets and calorimeters to deduce the charge and energy of the particles.  And they can trace back the paths of different particles where they meet.  And simply with conservation of energy, momentum (or rather 4-momentum), charge, lepton number, all sorts of other numbers,... they can reconstruct the original particle that has decayed.
The detectors are certainly capable of doing that, but they likely don't do that for every single detected particle.

[It's literally not:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War)

&gt; As the Soviet Union weakened in early 1991, the Republic of Georgia declared its independence. Amidst this backdrop, a 1991–1992 war between Georgia and separatists **left parts of the territory of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast under de facto Russian-backed and internationally unrecognised separatist control.** After the war was halted, a joint peacekeeping force of Georgian, Russian and Ossetian troops was stationed in the territory. Meanwhile, a similar situation developed during 1992–1993 in the Georgian region of Abkhazia. After a prolonged lull, complex relations between Georgia and Russia began to worsen drastically in April 2008. **Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages on 1 August,** with a sporadic response from Georgian peacekeepers in the region. The Georgian Army was sent to South Ossetia on 7 August to defend civilians and restore order.[30] Most of Tskhinvali, South Ossetia's capital, was recaptured in hours. Georgia later said it was also responding to Russia moving non-peacekeeping units into the country.

&gt;[...] either a eurozone parliament consisting of the members of the European parliament from the countries concerned (a sub-formation of the European parliament reduced to the eurozone countries), or **a new chamber based on grouping a portion of the members of the national parliaments** (eg 30 French MPs from the National Assembly, 40 members from the German Bundestag, 30 Italian deputies etc, based on the population of each country, according to a simple principle: one citizen, one vote).

&gt;[...]

&gt;The European chamber would initially involve only the countries of the eurozone that want to move towards a greater political, fiscal and budgetary union. But it would be designed to welcome all EU countries agreeing to go down this road. **A minister of finance of the eurozone, and eventually an actual European government, would answer to the European chamber.**

&gt;This new democratic architecture for Europe would make it possible to finally overcome today's inertia and the myth that the council of heads of state could serve as a second chamber representing the states. This wrong fable reflects the political impotence of our continent: **it is impossible for one person to represent a country, unless we resign ourselves to the permanent impasse imposed by unanimity**. To finally move to majority rule on the fiscal and budgetary matters that the eurozone countries choose to share, **it is necessary to create a genuine European chamber, where each country is represented not by its head of state alone, but by members who represent all political persuasions.**

First, that isn't what that adage means though.  The adage is usually about not causing a panic when there is no need to panic.  In this case, there was reason to panic.

Second, I don't think you claim about trying to:

&gt;mitigate the chances of some kind of self-fulfilling frenzy of people withdrawing their money. 

holds water.  I mean, you could make that case about the capital controls, but not about the banks reopening.  I mean, the banks were already closed at that point.  Capital controls were already in place.  People *couldn't* withdraw all of their money even if they wanted to.

As such, it seems crazy to claim this this was his reason, *especially* when it was said in an interview in which he was pushing his political agenda.

I mean, lying about the banks re-opening couldn't actually do much in the way of preventing the bank run since cap controls were already in place.  However, lying about it could certainly help push his political agenda.

As such, I don't know how people look at that and conclude that it was to prevent a bank run.  It just seems illogical, and clearly so.

&gt;Further to which, it is possible he did believe the banks would open. He is not a prophet. If I make an assertion based on my sincere beliefs and it turns out to be incorrect, is that a lie?

It depends on what those beliefs were based on.  I mean, I had a guy that owed me money once and said he would pay me on a monday.  Monday rolled around and he didn't have the money.  I called him a liar and he said he didn't lie, he had bought some lottery tickets and had a really good feeling that he was going to win the drawing the previous Friday.

Regardless of if he claims he sincerely believed it or not, that guy is a liar in my book, no question.

He committed to a result without qualification without any way to force that result or any solid basis to expect it would happen.  That is a lie, to me.

Now, if you have reasons that would logically make V. think the banks would open back up, I'm happy to see them.

Let's imagine that Portugal's population qualified it for 10 Portuguese MPs in that chamber. The 10 Portuguese MPs for the European chamber would therefore be (using De Hondt distribution, no idea what distribution would actually be used if this were actually implemented):

&gt;PSD: 5

&gt;PS: 3

&gt;PP: 1

&gt;CDU: 1

&gt;BE: 0

These would be taken from each party's elected MPs for the national parliament (so they'd effectively get a double mandate - one for the national parliament, and one for the European chamber).

To offer the inverse perspective - Romanian accents (any of the accents deemed civilized enough to be allowed on TV) sound very pretentious and funny to Moldavians. If you wanted to imitate a spoiled lord, a Bucharestian accent would be your go-to.

It is very much like the British Accent in English, except we find it both funny and intimidating, because ,**in Moldova** it is *normally* a sign of extensive education, and Moldavians have an inferiority complex when it comes to language because our dialect is a mix of regionalisms (aka funny rural words) and foreign russian words, while standard Romanian is deemed purer, more literary and more beautiful. 

It does not, however, *sound* more beautiful in itself and it certainly isn't attractive. Moldavians that try hard to sound Romanian have associated it with lameness and showing off. Manele songs aren't helping either.

What is the reason to panic? By the time of that interview, the banks were closed. Why would you prefer if YV instead of trying to play it cool, said 'no we are fucked, the banks will remain closed until we accept the creditors proposals, the referendum is a waste of time'?

&gt;It depends on what those beliefs were based on.

Well, I think *plenty* of people were surprised that the ECB elected to *contribute* to the financial instability in Greece instead of acting to mitigate it. I know I was. At no point when I heard that interview did I think YV was *lying*. Clearly he was wrong, but to err is human.

So besides this example, which as I said I do not find convincing at all, what else have you got? If this is it, I don't think it is enough to make a case on.

I'm sure we disagree on who carries the responsibility of 1991 and 2008, although anyone who pins all responsibility on either of the four actors is in my opinion mistaken. But we have to consider the future of the country. Georgia isn't getting these territories back. The people in the territories do not want it, and they have a point given their history. Also Russia does not want it, which pretty much settles the issue.

Clinging on to this dream that Georgia will 'regain' these territories will only bring them hatred and misery. And for us it means more tensions with Russia. Although these are overshadowed by the annexation of Crimea anyhow.

So I think that Georgia might be better off accepting this loss because it would pretty much mean accepting the inevitable. It will certainly hurt a lot of patriotic feelings, but from that point on, they can move forward, maybe even mending the past.

It's great that Georgia is sympathetic to the West, but it's effectively isolating itself and this has done them great harm. They need to find another way and we should help them with that instead of whispering fantasies in their heads.

&gt; What I find totally baffling is the position of those who are aiming for economic and monetary union without the creation of new political institutions (apart from a new central bank), and who raise their hands in horror at the words ‘federal’ or ‘federalism’.

* [Europe’s US imported nightmare](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=31281)

&gt; The 1970 Werner Report outlined a comprehensive timetable for the creation of a full economic and monetary union by the end of the decade.

&gt; It was clear the Committee wanted monetary and fiscal policy to be centralised with the “centre of decision of economic policy … [to] … be politically responsible to a European Parliament”.

&gt; A later study by the MacDougall Committee in 1975 also emphasised that an effective economic and monetary union would require a strong fiscal presence at the federal level.

&gt; They assessed that:

&gt; &gt; It is most unlikely that the Community will be anything like so fully integrated in the field of public finance for many years to come as the existing economic unions we have studied. 

&gt; The Werner Report was not implemented because of the growing currency instability the French fear of German dominance and their unwillingness cede power to supranational institutions, combined with the German inflation obsession, stood in the way.

&gt; The two nations could clearly find ways to cooperate on a political level but trying to form an economic and monetary union was difficult.

&gt; In 1972, the Governor of the Danish Central Bank said (quote from my book):

&gt; &gt; I will begin to believe in European economic and monetary union when someone explains how you control nine horses that are all running at different speeds within the same harness.

&gt; So the key to understanding the Euro crisis is the Trilemma[1] : a country must pick two out of a fixed exchange rate, free capital flow, and sovereign monetary policy. 

[The euro was a big mistake, and Greece is paying the price](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/30/8868973/euro-greece-crisis-mistake)

&gt; A common currency needs shared economic institutions [...]

&gt; Common banking policies. [...] Common fiscal policies. [...] A common labor market [...]

* [Social dimension of the Economic and Monetary Union](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-14-455_en.htm)

&gt; Due to the absence of a lender of last resort or a common countercyclical budget, financial market panic can force EMU countries to adopt austerity policies. We know that such developments have a particularly negative impact on workers, the unemployed and everyone whose quality of life depends on public services.

&gt; With such asymmetric allocation of costs and benefits, the EMU is not functioning well and its sustainability cannot be taken for granted.

&gt; In the history of the European Communities, two attempts at monetary cooperation have already broken down because the system was not resilient enough. The existence of a single currency in itself should not be seen as a sufficient guarantee against such a breakdown to happen again.

&gt; New pillars, new stabilising mechanisms are needed in the architecture of the EMU.

&gt; What should therefore be done in the wake of European elections with protest votes at record high is a re-run of the fairness test for the EMU. We should again put on the Schleier des Nichtwissens, forget about the individual strengths and weaknesses of individual countries and adapt the EMU in a way that it can be trusted to function equally well for each Member State and each social group.

&gt; A common currency is an excellent monetary arrangement under some circumstances, a poor monetary arrangement under others. Whether it is good or bad depends primarily on the adjustment mechanisms that are available to absorb the economic shocks and dislocations that impinge on the various entities that are considering a common currency. Flexible exchange rates are a powerful adjustment mechanism for shocks that affect the entities differently. It is worth dispensing with this mechanism to gain the advantage of lower transaction costs and external discipline only if there are adequate alternative adjustment mechanisms. 

* [Martin Wolf - The Euro: The Future of a Bad Monetary Marriage - 21 May 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwk6jI4NBo)

&gt; None of the necessary conditions -economic, political, or financial- for making such a monetary marriage work actually existed.

&gt; If the euro zone is to work, it needs Europe-level political authority and power in at least four areas: a central bank that can generate market confidence and liquidity; a banking authority that can regulate financial risk and uncertainty across the euro zone; mechanisms for fiscal redistribution and economic adjustment in times of crisis; and a sense of political solidarity to navigate the conflicts that arise in financial crises. Yet it only partially meets these criteria today.

* [Why anyone who compares Puerto Rico to Greece is wrong](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/03/why-anyone-who-compares-puerto-rico-to-greece-is-wrong/)

&gt; None of this is true in Greece. The problem is the euro zone doesn't have an equivalent of the FDIC. Each country is responsible for bailing out its own banks. But this creates a doom loop where weak banks can drag down a weak government or a weak government can drag down weak banks. The latter is what's happened in Greece. Its government is broke and that's made its banks broke too, since they hold a lot of government-guaranteed assets that might not be worth much anymore. That only leaves two ways to get the banks the money they need: take it from depositors or print it. But Greece can't print money as long as it's part of the euro—only the ECB can do that—so it'd have to leave the common currency to do this. Then, and only then, could it print all the drachmas it needed to fill the hole in its banks' balance sheets. In either case, though, people would lose a lot of their savings, whether their deposits were directly taxed or indirectly so with devaluation. That's why there's been so much panic in Greece, which, after the ECB refused to help, left Greece's government no choice but to close its banks to save them.

&gt; So a poorly designed currency union is really a doomsday device for turning fiscal crises into financial ones.

No. There's zero correlation. For a start, the Occitan heartland is southwest in the 2 kisses land, and the oïl heartland is Paris which is also in the 2 kisses area. Besides, the borders of the 3 and 4 areas do not fit any [language borders](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Langues_de_la_France.svg/2000px-Langues_de_la_France.svg.png) (notice how Normandy is split into bits, or how the 3 area goes into Francoprovençal territory, or how the languedocien/provençal split is halfway through the 3 area).

Also, it's oïl, not oui.

&gt;So just because they aren't the majority in the regions in which they are traditionally defined as living within, they no longer exist as a culture?

You don't get it. It's not that Bretons are a minority in Brittany. That makes no sense, Breton is literally defined as living in Brittany. It's that almost nobody in Brittany thinks of ""Breton"" as their ""ethnicity"" or primary culture.

Besides each case is different :

* Bretons pretty much all speak French and identify as French, but they do have a distinct culture, for instance regarding folk music (which is really big there), food, maritime culture etc. They also like to affect nationalism though most of them are only half-serious about it. That culture doesn't include anything about kisses, you'll notice on the map how Brittany is divided.

* Nobody in France identifies as ""German"", I imagine you mean Alsatians, well they identify as French and sometimes also Alsatians, not Germans. Apart from that they're like Bretons.

* Occitan is not a reasonable demonym and has never really been. There is no occitan culture. There's a Provençal culture and a Gascon culture and a Languedocian culture etc etc. Also the Occitan languages are dead. Nothing distinguishes former Occitan-speaking regions from the rest of the country (northern regions also have their dead language and local particularisms etc).


* A non-negligible part of Corsicans do think they're Corsicans before being French.

I feel like you're thinking of French regions as if they were Indian reservations. That makes no sense. There has never been mass deportations in France since the name exists, or populations being replaced by other ones, or wars motivated by cultural difference.",null,0,null,1436908299,null,0,false,0,ct3e9ap,null,t3_3d6el6,null,t1_ct3e9ap,null,t1_ct3d6a0,null,null,null,1437854592,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

After the referendum, he felt they had a mandate to take those measures, but he was voted down and the government preferred to continue negotiations.

From [the New Statesman interview](http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2015/07/yanis-varoufakis-full-transcript-our-battle-save-greece):

&gt;**V**:My view was – and I put this to the government – that if they dared shut our banks down, which I considered to be an aggressive move of incredible potency, we should respond aggressively but without crossing the point of no return.

&gt; We should issue our own IOUs, or even at least announce that we’re going to issue our own euro-denominated liquidity; we should haircut the Greek 2012 bonds that the ECB held, or announce we were going to do it; and we should take control of the Bank of Greece. This was the triptych, the three things, which I thought we should respond with if the ECB shut down our banks.

&gt; … I was warning the Cabinet this was going to happen [the ECB shut our banks] for a month, in order to drag us into a humiliating agreement. When it happened – and many of my colleagues couldn’t believe it happened – my recommendation for responding “energetically”, let’s say, was voted down.

&gt; ...

&gt; And then the referendum happened, and the referendum gave us an amazing boost, one that would have justified this type of energetic response [his plan] against the ECB, but then that very night the government decided that the will of the people, this resounding ‘No’, should not be what energised the energetic approach [his plan].

&gt; Instead it should lead to major concessions to the other side: the meeting of the council of political leaders, with our Prime Minister accepting the premise that whatever happens, whatever the other side does, we will never respond in any way that challenges them.

She is his only child, and according to his ex-wife, he still calls them almost every day [2]. The ""summer home"" on Aegina Island actually belongs to his current partner, Danae Stratou [3].

School holidays in Sydney end *this Sunday*, 12 July [4], and Xenia has be in school on Tuesday, 14 July (Monday is teachers-only). So it's entirely possible that this family trip was planned a while ago. If you were in his situation, having been through the wringer like he has these past few months and now being just another MP, would you miss a rare opportunity to see your young child?

null,false,grumbal,SVAK,Slovenská Džamahírija,null,"&gt; The International Monetary Fund has sent its strongest signal that it may walk away from Greece’s new bailout programme, arguing in a confidential analysis that the country’s debt is skyrocketing and budget surplus targets set by Athens cannot be achieved. 
&gt; 
&gt; In the three-page memo, sent to EU authorities at the weekend and obtained by the Financial Times, the IMF said the recent turmoil in the Greek economy would lead debt to peak at close to 200 per cent of economic output over the next two years. At the start of the eurozone crisis, Athens’ debt stood at 127 per cent.
&gt; 
&gt; The memo argues that **only through large-scale debt relief** — something eurozone officials have fiercely resisted — could Greece see its debt fall to levels where it would be able to return to the financial markets.
&gt; 
&gt; “Greece’s debt can now only be made sustainable through debt relief measures that go far beyond what Europe has been willing to consider so far,” the memo reads.
&gt; 
&gt; Under its rules, the IMF is not allowed to participate in a bailout if a country’s debt is deemed unsustainable and there is no prospect of it returning to private bond markets for financing. The IMF has bent its rules to participate in previous Greek bailouts, but the memo suggests it can no longer do so.
&gt; 
&gt; IMF involvement in Greece’s rescue has been critical to a German-led group of eurozone hardliners who believe the European Commission, one of the other Greek bailout monitors, is not sufficiently rigorous in its evaluations.
&gt; 
&gt; The issue became one of the major sticking points during all-night negotiations between Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, and Angela Merkel, his German counterpart, at the weekend, with Mr Tsipras repeatedly refusing to accept IMF participation in a new bailout.
&gt; 
&gt; According to EU officials, Ms Merkel stood firm on the issue, telling the Greek premier there would be no bailout — and therefore “Grexit” from the eurozone — without a formal request made to the IMF for participation in a new programme. The final bailout deal states that “Greece will request continued IMF support” once its current IMF programme expires. 
&gt; 
&gt; If the IMF were to walk away from the Greek programme, it could cause significant political and financial problems for Berlin and other eurozone creditors. Without the IMF’s imprimatur, German officials have said they would struggle to win approval for any new bailout funding in the Bundestag. German MPs must approve both the reopening of new talks and the final terms of the third bailout.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, an EU official said that of the €86bn in Greek financing requirements, the European Stability Mechanism — the eurozone’s €500bn bailout fund — was expected to put up only €40bn-€50bn.
&gt; 
&gt; The current IMF programme, which still has €16.4bn in undisbursed funds and runs through March 2016, is expected to make up some of the difference, and eurozone officials had been assuming a follow-on IMF programme would contribute as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Any shortfall would have to be made up through Greek privatisation proceeds, which have repeatedly fallen short of expectations, or through Greek borrowing on the bond market, which has dried up since the Syriza-led government took power in Athens in January — and which the IMF memo said was highly unlikely to materialise.
&gt; 
&gt; “Greece cannot return to markets anytime soon at interest rates that it can afford from a medium-term perspective,” the IMF wrote.
&gt; 
&gt; Under the terms of IMF participation in Greece’s second bailout, eurozone officials had agreed they would take steps to ensure Athens debt fall go “substantially lower” than 110 per cent of gross domestic product by 2022. The new IMF memo said it is now projected to be at 170 per cent by 2022.
&gt; 
&gt; It added that financing in a new programme would make Greece’s bailout funding levels so large that they would exceed “the 15 per cent of GDP threshold deemed safe” under IMF rules, and would “continue rising in the long term”.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Tsipras has long argued for debt relief. In Monday’s bailout deal, eurozone leaders only agreed to consider the topic after Greece completes the first programme review, which is unlikely to occur until late this year.
&gt; 
&gt; Even then, EU leaders have only proposed lengthening maturities on existing eurozone bailout loans rather than full-scale writedowns, which Berlin argues is against EU law.
&gt; 
&gt; But the IMF memo said eurozone leaders needed to look at the issue more immediately and in amounts far larger than currently under consideration.
&gt; 
&gt; Among the options it suggested was a “very dramatic extension” of repayment plans with a “grace period” another 30 years on the “entire stock of European debt” — meaning Greece would not make a single interest or principle payment on eurozone loans until 2053; it already has such a grace period until 2023.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, eurozone creditors would have to make “annual transfers to the Greek budget” — meaning eurozone grants to Athens — or “deep upfront haircuts”, the IMF said.

&gt;Five months of intense negotiations between Greece and the Eurogroup never had a chance of success.

* How do I know Grexit is an important part of Dr Schäuble’s plan for Europe?

Piketty actually also suggests that as a valid possibility (though he later says he'd prefer the other choice, though I don't understand exactly why). Let me quote:

&gt;[...] either **a eurozone parliament consisting of the members of the European parliament from the countries concerned (a sub-formation of the European parliament reduced to the eurozone countries)**, or a new chamber based on grouping a portion of the members of the national parliaments (eg 30 French MPs from the National Assembly, 40 members from the German Bundestag, 30 Italian deputies etc, based on the population of each country, according to a simple principle: one citizen, one vote).

As for why its needed, it's because the current EZ governance is being done in secret in the Eurogroup, and requires unanimity. Each country has exactly one representative, so there isn't a plurality of opinions (any party other than the country's current government parties are not represented at all). There are no rules for Eurogroup meetings and what exact powers they have, it's being made up as we go. It makes a ton of sense to codify them into a parliamentary procedure where countries have multiple representatives (so there is a plurality of opinion), and decide exactly how everything should work, as well as opening it up to the public to add accountability.

In addition, Piketty's suggestion assumes a fiscal union where the federal level of the EZ actually has some taxation powers (it's the first part of the proposal, actually), and he says that's only possible with some sort of political union and democratic federal-level representation to decide how that money is spent:

&gt;Our second proposal is the most important and flows from the first. To approve the tax base for the CIT, and more generally to discuss and adopt the fiscal, financial and political decisions on what is to be shared in the future in a democratic and sovereign fashion, we must establish a parliamentary chamber for the eurozone.",null,0,null,1436909845,null,0,1436910433,0,ct3fa76,null,t3_3d9014,null,t1_ct3fa76,null,t1_ct3f3ka,null,null,null,1437855392,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

From what I understand, their promises of getting a hairline off their debt, promises of reducing taxes to pre-bailout levels, promises of returning pensions... these are all turning out to be lies told to the people in order to get elected

No no, that I don't think is a fair appraisal. I would say Syriza was idealistic; naive in the political machinations of the Eurogroup. I believe they were sincere in their wish to get a 'new deal' for Greece, and that they severely over-estimated the leverage they had to negotiate with. This doesn't make them *liars*, it just makes them *wrong*. Important distinction regarding intent, I think.

&gt;And I would appreciate if you would elaborate on why you feel it's flawed to assess the ""fairness"" of bailing Greece out.

This is just a can of worms, to me. As an economist, my idea of what is fair is probably not the same as the man on the street. Fair in this context for me would mean, what is the best possible outcome for *all* European citizens? Say we could deduce this - which is itself a whole other exercise, but say we can. Would those same citizens necessarily recognise this outcome as the best for everyone?

Consider: public opinion in many countries (Germany, NL, Finland) has been driven by a media narrative which trivialises the economics and emphasises the 'morals' of this story. To the point where we now hear more about the moral aspects than the economics. In fact, the whole response of the Eurozone countries to this crisis has been driven by the German 'ordoliberal' approach, which is very rules-focused and rooted in moral philosophy. Arguably, this approach has been a complete and *predictable* failure. There is simple, graduate-level economics which could have been applied as a solution and could not have yielded a worse outcome, but the *moral* connotations of that approach are probably difficult for many people to accept: we should be borrowing more, spending more, trying desperately to 'overheat' the Eurozone to kick start the economy into life. But this is something which is politically not welcome and further not 'intuitively obvious'.

So a discussion of what is fair is fraught. To me, the whole response so far has been unfair to *all of us* and most unfair to those who have had to bear the worst of it, i.e. the Greeks. So I don't really see how the notion of fairness can be invoked to drum up ... sympathy? or something, for the populations of, say, Germany or the Netherlands who have seen no *quantifiable negatives* from the lending to Greece, apart from the number of sensational headlines in the newspapers.",null,0,null,1436910781,null,0,false,0,ct3fw41,null,t3_3d8zt7,null,t1_ct3fw41,null,t1_ct3f3o3,null,null,null,1437855807,null,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9,null

Especially at the Breton border, where things begin to get mixed up, and around the border of what would traditionally be defined as Occitania, there's a shift towards four.

&gt;it's oïl, not oui.

Sorry, I've always seen it written as 'oui', [which Wikipedia recognizes as a variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langues_d%27o%C3%AFl). 

&gt;You don't get it. It's not that Bretons are a minority in Brittany. That makes no sense, Breton is literally defined as living in Brittany. It's that almost nobody in Brittany thinks of ""Breton"" as their ""ethnicity"" or primary culture.

No, I understand this and pointed it out. I'm sorry if I used to wrong language, but when I said ""they aren't the majority"" I was thinking of people who would identify as ethnically not Breton, not people who *are* Breton in some existential sense although they speak and identify as French.

&gt;Bretons pretty much all speak French and identify as French, but they do have a distinct culture, for instance regarding folk music (which is really big there), food, maritime culture etc. They also like to affect nationalism though most of them are only half-serious about it. That culture doesn't include anything about kisses, you'll notice on the map how Brittany is divided.

I agree with this for the mostpart, I was thinking of how Brittany is less unified on their style in la bise, as I said above.

&gt;Nobody in France identifies as German

[That seems like an overstatement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_distribution_of_German_speakers)

&gt;Occitan is not a reasonable demonym

Well, it might not be a single ethnic entity, but at the least it's a useful term to designate a variety of people with much in common. And [there is a significant minority in southern France and the Aran valleys who would call themselves ""Occitan"".](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalisme_occitan)

&gt;Also the Occitan languages are dead.

Where did you get this idea? 

[No](https://oc.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan), they're [most](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan) certainly [not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language). [At](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdYpvY6Efos). [all](http://www.libertat.org/). 

In decline no doubt, but that's just about as valid as claiming Welsh is dead.

&gt;I feel like you're thinking of French regions as if they were Indian reservations. That makes no sense. There has never been mass deportations in France since the name exists, or populations being replaced by other ones, or wars motivated by cultural difference.

No, but there have been distinct nationalities. There may not have been wars 'motivated by cultural difference' because when Occitania and Brittany were conquered there was not a significant social consciousness of any sort of nationalism. And populations may not have been replaced by deportation, but through language shift and political suppression (especially in the Revolutionary period, and the first developments of a French nationality)

I'm curious exactly why that is. I mean, a common currency cannot work without transfers to poorer states (read into a [Optimum Currency Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_currency_area)), and the current EU budget (under 1% GDP) is not enough, by far. [The US federal budget, for example, is around 20% of GDP.](http://www.supportingevidence.com/Government/fed_budget_as_percent_GDP_over_time.html)

These transfers do not have to be (and shouldn't be) simply giving free money. For example, in the US the work through federal-level subsidies, for example unemployment, health care, etc, as well as federal investment. Even though federal taxes and subsidies do not discriminate between states, it's obvious that richer states end up paying more than what they get in subsidies back, while poorer states pay less than what they get.

In the end, having a stable currency union is good for all its members. The richer countries get a weaker currency and many trade partners, which more than pays for the fact they are not a net recipient, so it's not like simply dissolving the currency union will make everything better for anyone.

Now, of course, such transfers (and federal taxes) without democratic control over where the money actually ends up would be ridiculous. This means that the federal level (in our case, Eurozone) would need to have the power to fiscalize the national budgets and make sure that happens. For this, political representation at federal level is needed. In addition, taxation without representation would be ridiculous, so even more reason for a political union to control any possible federal taxes.

&gt;it is a way for finmins to agree on joint decisions, and we know who participates. 

But we don't know what happens in the Eurogroup - everything is done behind closed doors. How is that accountable?

Also, they've ended up as such an important decision-making body, don't you find it weird that each country has a single representative? Or do you think the whole population of France has a single opinion on EZ matters, and therefore a single representative is more than enough?

I mean, Varoufakis published an article in the Guardian saying that on July 10, a day before the Ministry of Finance leaked the proposal, and people still thought he was paranoid. Tsipras' refusal to fold kind of forced Schäuble to make that suggestion publicly, and it went down *terribly*. The EC called it a non-starter and it really strained relations with France. And Schäuble kind of went overboard with trying to sweeten the ""time-out"" by promising humanitarian aid and debt relief if Greece took it, it became really apparent he wasn't there to hammer out a deal at all. Plus the whole KfW thing was a PR nightmare for him (I have a theory he deliberately chose it to piss off the Greeks to get them to walk away, but that didn't work out). Their actions may have been met with enthusiasm at home, but their reputations took a really bad hit abroad, and they've lost the IMF, which will make a lot of CDU deputies unhappy.

Syriza is looking at 30 dissidents out of 149 deputies, I don't think it'll implode. Most Greeks continue to support both the government and Tsipras as PM.

It's a shame that appears to be the case on every copy of those Wikipedia articles in every language. Perhaps the information comes from the sources cited, written by linguists and historians, rather than from the imaginations of ""fringe nationalists"".

And I don't see how I'm applying concepts ""developed for colonisation"", unless you consider the mere idea of multiple nationalities existing within a European state ridiculous. 

EDIT: And I assume you mean colonisation of the new world, as colonisation has occured in Europe throughout history. 

There's no need to be so hostile and claim I have ""no idea what I'm speaking about"" when you've provided nothing of the sort to support the notion.

null,false,averagemonkey,learner,Ziemlich gut (C1) - Der Däne,null,"Since you already speak basic German, I would suggest you find German speakers to chat with. I find the best way to do this is using the app HelloTalk (iOS and Android). By chatting with a number of natives, you will quickly grow very comfortable with basic conversations (in text). Then you can slowly branch out the conversations you're having to cover more complicated topics. Notice how your conversation partners ask and answer questions. 

The most important thing is not to worry about making mistakes. If you are afraid of making mistakes, you will never improve. HelloTalk even has a feature whereby your partner can correct your mistakes, so YOU ARE MEANT TO MAKE LOTS OF MISTAKES. THIS IS GOOD.

More resources:

- [Duolingo](http://duolingo.com): Learn German from scratch by translating sentences to and from German.

- [Lang-8](http://lang-8.com): Write texts in German and have them corrected by native speakers.

- Check out Langsam Gesprochende Nachrichten (Slowly Spoken News) by Deutsche Welle. It is a daily news podcast spoken slowly and clearly. A transcript is always provided. [Here is today's episode.](http://www.dw.com/de/14072015-langsam-gesprochene-nachrichten/a-18582701) This is most likely going to be too advanced for you, but even then I would still suggest you listen to it and read along in order to improve your listening comprehension.

- To listen to more casual German, watch Türkisch für Anfänger, a German TV series about a teenage girl whose mother marries a Turkish father of two, resulting in the two families moving in together. [The first episode can be found here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT5hTQ_A2LU) And you can find [all the transcripts here.](http://www.diemitdemforum.de/viewforum.php?f=48)

If you stumble upon a piece of grammar that confuses you, just ask the sub and we'll explain it to you or point you in the right direction. In general, don't worry about grammar right off the bat. Your first priority should be to hit up some German speakers and practise your simple conversation skills until your feel very comfortable with introducing yourself and asking simple questions.

--

Read the works of the 'founding fathers' of the EU. They predicted that through neo-functionalism^[1] we'd run into just these barriers. Similarly the architects of the monetary union knew that should a crisis arise the only solution would be dissolution (which is no real solution) or meaningful integration.

--

One example is that of optimal currency areas. Without getting technical optimal currency area describes efficient monetary unions. We knew -- with the introduction of the Euro -- that Europe's new currency union wouldn't meet the requirements. 

--

Neo-functionalism highlights the 'spill-over' operational logic in systems. Harmonize rail infrastructure? Well, now we need to harmonize national regulatory approaches to rail. The risk is that we push back against this harmonization. If we had started with federalism (or move quickly to it now) these problems wouldn't exist. They exist because we're dealing with a quasi-state. *Nothing that is happening wasn't predicted by economists. Nothing.*


--

We can't stay still. We can either move forward, and work to meaningfully 'complete' the union; alternatively we can abandon the European project, dooming the continent to economic ruination for a generation. 

----

[1]: Neo-functionalism is a theoretical framework in International Relations for examining the EU from inception. Neo-functionalism contrasts with federalism. The primary split is derived from the view of economists, political scientists, and politicians; that being, *what is the most effective way of getting to a stable united Europe?* With some arguing that politicians would never relinquish their own power; even if that meant long-term stability.

Most likely not very much. Dropping out of the EMU at a time where the EU was preoccupied with salvaging their banking system, bailing out other countries and generally stomping wildfires would have caused as spiteful reactions of the creditors today.

It would have been a full-blown default, together with capital controls and no backup from the ECB. Greece was overleveraged even back then.

And that needs to be maintained for obvious reasons. But simultaneously a *tradition* of European collaboration still needs to be developed. And such a tradition can't be built up purely through ideology, but through action that reflects such a spirit of both shared successes and failures.

I also can't figure out whether Tsipras thinks he might be able to renegotiate the deal along the way, because this one is clearly unworkable, or if he has made peace with the idea of Greece having to leave the Euro and just wants to go out with a bang.

**IMF fires a cannonball into Greek bailout**

We’ve now got hold of the new IMF report into Greece’s debt sustainability.

And a quick perusal shows that the Fund has comprehensively obliterated the notion that this third Greek bailout will work, as it stands.

The introduction to the report says enough, really:

&gt; Greece’s public debt has become highly unsustainable. This is due to the easing of policies during the last year, with the recent deterioration in the domestic macroeconomic and financial environment because of the closure of the banking system adding significantly to the adverse dynamics.

&gt;    The financing need through end-2018 is now estimated at €85bn and debt is expected to peak at close to 200 percent of GDP in the next two years, provided that there is an early agreement on a program. Greece’s debt can now only be made sustainable through debt relief measures that go far beyond what Europe has been willing to consider so far.

The IMF’s fundamental conclusion is that Greece will simply not be able to borrow at affordable rates again, until its debt burden is lower.

The situation was already bad - but recent developments make it much, much worse.

&gt; The events of the past two weeks—the closure of banks and imposition of capital controls—are extracting a heavy toll on the banking system and the economy, leading to a further significant deterioration in debt sustainability relative to what was projected in our recently published DSA.

Today’s report is light on projections, but the ones included are stark enough. The stand-out fact: Greek debt is on track to peak at close to 200% of GDP in the next two years. Only Japan, after two lost decades, comes close to that ratio.

Perhaps this is why the US government, led by Treasury secretary Jack Lew, has been so vocal about the need for debt sustainability to be addressed?

The IMF is also amusingly sniffy about the targets Greece is being set. For example:

&gt;    Medium-term primary surplus target: Greece is expected to maintain primary surpluses for the next several decades of 3.5 percent of GDP. Few countries have managed to do so. The reversal of key public sector reforms already in place— notably pension and civil service reforms—without yet any specification of alternative reforms raises concerns about Greece’s ability to reach this target

But it’s conclusion is clear - if Europe wants this bailout to work, it must either grant Greece three decades grace before repaying its debts, or cut the face value of its borrowings, deeply....

------------------------

The report is couched in diplomatic language, but the [gist](https://twitter.com/AlbertoNardelli/status/621083318340161536) is that the IMF will neither participate in a new bailout **nor** conclude any reviews from the current program unless it is satisfied that the debt is sustainable.

null,false,marsman,NORN,Northern Ireland,null,"&gt;The question becomes: what models of governmental and economic harmonization work?

Only if one assumes harmonisation is the only direction of travel (and I would argue that as with many other systems, there is a benefit to some diversity..). 

&gt;We can't stay still. We can either move forward, and work to meaningfully 'complete' the union; alternatively we can abandon the European project, dooming the continent to economic ruination for a generation.

This is simply not true.. But lets take a step back.  The basis for any European Union has to be the consent of those who are part of it, it doesn't matter how much more efficient or stable a system is if it is imposed rather than arrived at.. That means collectively we need to decide on where the EU is going and get the support of as many people as possible to drive that forward. Now that might mean we have a two speed EU, or something else, it might mean the EU comes together as something other than a federal whole, or that it remains or even reverses integration from the current point. None of that is terrible...

Now your point seems to be ever further union, or economic ruination.. that simply isn't credible there is no basis for it. Germany is the second largest exporter in the world (after the US..) it isn't going to suddenly curl up and die if the EU doesn't continue with integration, the UK is the worlds 5th Largest economy, France the 6th, they aren't going to suddenly collapse if the EU isn't en-route to a quasi-state.

I realise that some people would prefer a federal Europe with central EU institutions taking precedence over national institutions, as opposed to the current arrangement of national supremacy.  I realise that there are several motivators for that, from domestic corruption to perceptions that an EU wide legislature/government might be more palatable than whatever national government is currently elected. These are however pretty poor reasons. There are of course idealists and ideologues who see a federal EU as a counterpoint to the US as a superpower, there are no doubt many people out there who have a range of reasons why they want to see a united, federal (or similar..) Europe. 

But I would argue that they are a minority in far too many EU member states for that to be achievable even in the mid term (frankly, probably not at all). What is frankly frightening is the number of people who are vocal on these issues advocating less than democratic approaches, frankly it seems that getting to the point of a European superstate seems more important than how we might get there..

Personally I think a multi-speed Europe is possible, I think the EU needs to bring countries along and bring them together in a manner that isn't coercive, and I'd argue that the EU is too big to be some sort of monolithic democracy (you'd end up with autonomous regions, breakaways, and all the other issues with a massive population being shoehorned into a single political entity where it simply isn't appropriate..). So we need to find something that works, something that people agree on and something that may well not be a federal EU state.

&gt;Among the options it suggested was a “very dramatic extension” of repayment plans with a “grace period” another 30 years on the “entire stock of European debt” — meaning Greece would not make a single interest or principle payment on eurozone loans until 2053; it already has such a grace period until 2023.

The second option is not a debt haircut at all but just a more extreme version of the debt restructuring the EU has been providing so far.

Asking if Greece can be ""trusted"" with more money belies a fundamental misunderstanding of the problems facing Greece.  The state of their economy, and the foundations of the EMU, *demand* deficit spending to bring Greece out of recession.  The IMF, shockingly, has even said that Greece's debt is unsustainable.

Greece's debt is nearly 350bn euros.  The highest estimates I've seen of uncollected tax revenue and corruption waste are 30bn a year.  Even if Greece were to fix this overnight, it would still take more than a decade to pay off the debt, assuming they pay no interest.

--

Of course. And there can be plenty of diversity within federalism. My dissertation (for IR/PS) focused on just this subject and how through federalism (in the case of Europe) we can see regions reasserting their ethnic, cultural, or civic 'pride'. They don't need Spain, UK, France, etc. to be relevant. Within the EU -- especially a federal EU -- Europe has *greater* inter-regional freedom. 

--

Take for example America, a federal republic: (until recently) we had a contrast between states (like Washington) that, by popular vote, legalized marijuana, doctor-assisted suicide, and gay marriage. While other states (like Texas) impose 7+ year jail terms for marijuana possession, outlaw gay marriage, and fundamentally ignore the will of the dying and family. 

----

&gt;None of that is terrible...

I wasn't speaking from the position of politics in my previous post. I was explaining political terms (i.e. 'neo-functionalism') insofar as they were critical to understanding the economic ramifications of the systems of government and economics. Principally those comments are concerned with the economics. So yes, axiomatically, reversing course is 'terrible'. Why? Because of the economic implications. It may be what the people want, sure, but that isn't what I was considering. 

----

&gt;Now your point seems to be ever further union, or economic ruination.. that simply isn't credible there is no basis for it. Germany is the second largest exporter in the world (after the US..) it isn't going to suddenly curl up and die if the EU doesn't continue with integration....

--

Germany is heavily reliant on the artificially low Euro (in German terms). That is to say a German Mark would be worth significantly more than the Euro, thereby crippling their exports. Not to mention the legal and economic barriers concerned with restructuring an entire region. I'm sorry, but you're simply wrong here. That is the choice whether we like it or not. 

----

&gt;I realise that some people would prefer a federal Europe with central EU institutions taking precedence over national institutions, as opposed to the current arrangement of national supremacy. I realise that there are several motivators for that, from domestic corruption to perceptions that an EU wide legislature/government might be more palatable than whatever national government is currently elected. These are however pretty poor reasons.

--

That isn't why I favor the move. I favor federalism because it is more efficient, resilient, and dynamic. It depends: what's your position on 'states rights'? Principally in a federal Europe different states -- or microstates -- would have the ability to manage their own budgets, priorities, laws, etc. 

--

Ultimately I favor federalism because I understand the economics. It's the only stable solid-state solution (other than independent nation-state). That entails transfer payments, common deposit insurance, common debt, etc. 


----

&gt;Personally I think a multi-speed Europe is possible, I think the EU needs to bring countries along and bring them together in a manner that isn't coercive[.]

--

I've read numerous academics arguing just that point. And while they were political scientists, not economists, I'll cut them a break. Fundamentally a 'two-speed' Europe *could* work. But it would require a strict delineation between 'federal' and 'associate member'. And even then the required structure to ensure a 'two-speed' Europe would function entails relegating the 'associate members' to the likes of Puerto Rico or Guam. In other words, most of the responsibility, most of the benefit -- but no guarantee.

&gt;I mean surely the Greek-EU relationship isn't like the Federal-State relationship in the U.S., where the federal government will send the U.S. Military to invade your state and burn your shit to the ground if you try and leave.

Sorry, you're right. I read your post as 100.

&gt;I see no reason to transfer power to tax to a massive institution in which the whole country would hold 1.6% of votes.

Principle of subsidiarity:

&gt;Under the principle of subsidiarity, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central level or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level.

But anyway, I understand your concern. The problem is that there is no perfect solution: if you give one vote per person then some states end up quite powerless, but if you give each state equal power, or at least some amount of power other than one vote per person, then the vote of a Finn ends up being worth more - potentially many times more - than the vote of a German or Frenchman, which is fundamentally undemocratic.

But of course there is a tried and tested solution: you just do both.

Legally, they can only lend if the 'debt sustainability analysis' shows that they are highly likely to get the money back. Already in 2010 the analysis showed that was not likely - and they really fucked up their estimates of the impact of austerity, like much more than usual. A whole load of developing countries expressed misgivings about the 2010 bailout, not just about debt sustainability, but also about the impact of austerity on the Greek economy. The bailout was pushed through, sort of against the IMF's rules because of the impact a Greek default would have on the whole Eurozone at the time. Now the EU wants to do the same thing, more austerity and today Greek debt is definitly unsustainable, but there's no risk of wider contagnation so no excuse to bend the rules. That's the legal aspect, which is pretty clear.

Politically, I'm speculating, but the Americans want this sorted, which means debt relief, so they will want to put pressure on the Germans. The developing countries are well pissed off at the Europeans about this, for ignoring IMF rules and using it as their personal bailout fund. They've also wanted to put one of their guys in charge of the Fund, instead of a European and aren't too happy about Legrade. They probably still sympathise with the Greeks who have to adopt harsh policies.

Finally, the IMFs money comes from its members and they would like to see that money paid back. If the Germans can complain that their taxpayers want the loans to be repaid, then so can the Indians and everybody else.

null,false,Sssiiiddd,null,null,null,"&gt; I'll agree with you on the fact that the debt appears to be unsustainable. Greece says so too, and one of their demands was that part of that debt was written off. IMO that should have been done now instead of kicking the can down the road, because that problem will only grow bigger as time goes by.

Well, if the plan is to write the debt off, it doesn't really matter how big it gets, you just write more of it off later. The EZ needs the debt as a bargaining chip for Greece to really implement the reforms.

&gt;  The problem here is that the conditions that were demanded are counter-productive if the intention is to be able to pay off the debt. It's like you let someone work in freezing cold to pay off their debts but you demand they sell off their jacket first and then complain they can't do any work.

I disagree. The Greek economy was ruined by excessive spending based on loans, that is how they got bankrupt in 2008. You cannot fix excessive spending based on loans by an even increased spending based on more loans. The freezing cold work is not a good analogy in this case.

&gt; Austerity measures shrank the Greek economy and reduced the amount of money they are able to collect through taxes

You *need* to shrink the economy, the economy was artificially inflated in the first place, since it was functioning based on loan for 30 years.

&gt; businesses going bankrupt pay no taxes and increase unemployment, unemployed people not only pay no income tax but they also receive benefits for some time

Yes, this is an unfortunate side effect. Maybe it could have been somehow mitigated by implementing austerity in some other way (reducing government employees instead of raising taxes, for instance).

&gt;  Increased rate of suicide

This is cited very often. Even after the increase, the rate is still 20% less than the European average. They were just super-extra-happy before (living above their means).

&gt; Does this really have to be a competition about who has it worse?

I think yes, it's basic human nature. First I take care of my family, then my friends, then my neighbors, then my countrymen and only then the Greeks. If my family is suffering more than the Greeks, you will have a very hard time convincing me to help the Greeks first.

&gt; That doesn't change the fact that the conditions imposed on Greece are more about punishment than they are about money.

It's possible but hard to prove either way. The conditions are harsh because Greece needed harsh adjustments. Are they too  harsh? I have no idea.

&gt; This is a political issue - stomp down on the leftist government and force them to accept twice as much austerity as they would propose to a right-wing government.

Greece had right and left governments since 2008 and the conditions were kept the same. It was in fact Syriza that came to power on the promise to break/renegotiate those conditions. The EZ offered them to continue the second bailout on the same term. Syriza rejected them and went berserker, referendum and all. Now they requested a third bailout and the conditions got worse. Which is understandable because they want to borrow even more money. If they kept the status quo, the amount of austerity wouldn't have changed.

&gt; Refuse to negotiate until a certain person is removed from the table.

If that person is a problem, it's best for both parties to remove him. Negotiators are only human.

&gt; Refuse to accept proposals that bring the same income to the ones you propose, if they hurt the big money - like an extra tax on large profits, but instead tax both big and small companies the same way.

I'm gonna need a source on that.

&gt; It's a very clear message to the people: elect politicians who approve of austerity or the same thing will happen to you. That, above all else, is what is pissing me off about this situation.

I make my point again: Greece needed/needs austerity, same for some other countries. You cannot spend more than you earn forever. At some point you need to start spending less than you earn to pay your debts.

Think about this: imagine that in 2008 Europe would waved a magic wand and make Greece's whole debt disappear. Just forgiven, the whole thing. What would happen? In ~20 years they would be bankrupt again, because they kept an almost 10% deficit (20-30 billion euros a year of new debt created every year).",null,0,null,1436916477,null,0,false,0,ct3jecr,null,t3_3d424m,null,t1_ct3jecr,null,t1_ct2zuzr,null,null,null,1437858341,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

If the eurozone *genuinely* wants to get paid back, you need to allow Greece to grow and earn the money with which to pay you back.

Answer: it doesn't help. Because you are more interested in playing vindictive games than in getting paid back.

And Portugal is next. It won't be so much fun when you are being held down and kicked and waterboarded.

null,false,zscan,BAVA,Bavaria,null,"I guess there are multiple things going on at the same time and it probably pays off to take a view of individual motivations and how they aggregate over the population as a whole.

For example, I would guess that basically more or less every government worker in Greece fears for his job right now and it's probably not like they can easily get a job elsewhere in this economy. Until now they probably had a good standard of living and could support a family, send their kids to university, expected a good pension and so on. They had their life worked out. Now it's all starting to crumble. The future looks horrible.

I think a natural position to hold in this situation would be to be against any change at all. Defend what you have by any means. No wonder, they faked numbers and stats for years. No wonder they fought and delayed reforms in any which way. Stay in the Eurozone to keep ""your"" money flowing and blame everyone trying to take away ""your"" money. Those government workers aren't stupid, they know about the billions and billions they got from the EU or as debt, backed by the EU or EZ. They know that a Grexit would probably be worse even. But now we are at a point where the money actually stopped flowing. The ""stop them from taking over our country"" narrative is just an extreme form of the ""don't change anything"" position.

But there are many other groups with different opinions, too. Many youth have nothing to lose. They might as well have a fresh start outside the EZ and be more open to that. But they are also more open to extreme political views and propaganda, be it left or right. Business owners might oppose tax hikes, but be more open to a leaner government, less corruption and pension cuts in general (if they are not affected). Pensioners vote for everyone promising that they can keep their pensions. Of course it all gets complicated by political affiliations and propaganda in general. Politicians best blame others from outside (""banks"", EU, troika, IMF, Germany), not potential voters like government workers or tax evaders and of course the people pick that up, too.

It's really a huge mess. There is no way around reforms. Personally, I hope that people will look back in 10 or 20 years and say it was the right choice to go this route and that Greece is better off for it, but I certainly have doubts if it will work out at all.",null,0,null,1436919208,null,0,false,0,ct3l0pw,null,t3_3d8zt7,null,t1_ct3l0pw,null,t1_ct377ic,null,null,null,1437859082,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

null,false,Iagos_Beard,null,null,null,"American here! (My apologies for writing in English, pressed for time and have a lot of thoughts on the matter).   

I've spent a large amount of time in various places in Italy, and bestemmie are still a great source of wonder for me and are something I think about a lot. It's taken me a lot of time and a lot of experiences in Italy to get to the level of understanding I have of them and I still don't think I understand their magnitude/significance fully. The thing is, the English language just simply doesn't have anything that even closely relates to bestemmie, so its hard for me to wrap my mind around the concept. The fact they don't exist is completely fascinating to me and I think it says a lot about historical, cultural and religious differences between native Italian speakers and native English speakers.  

Let's take this line for example, because I think its a really interesting way to talk about how Italian minds and English minds differ in the way we think about offensive words:  

""In USA per esempio censurano Hell (Inferno) e/o usano heck al suo posto""   

The commenter is correct in stating that yes, it is common practice in English to replace hell with heck. But to be completely honest, this is done rarely and usually only around very young children or VERY religious folk. I have many Christian friends that say hell all the time. And in fact, they feel good about saying ""what the hell"", because it is substitute for the much more offensive ""what the fuck"". You will hear ""what the hell"" on public national television without any bleeps but if I heard ""what the heck"" on television it would sound strange and jarring to me, and would only make sense if said by a child. Even goddamnit has become colloquial to such an extent that it is massively more tame compared to anything containing the word 'fuck'. So this distinction in Italian between parolacci and bestemmie, its kinda backwards in English. And maybe this is because of Catholicism's great rooting in Italian culture? I just don't know. Catholicism and Christianity are popular in America too, but if I yelled God's a pig at the top of my lungs in a crowded market, people wouldn't be offended in the least - they'd just think I was crazy.

Another thing that's strange is censorship. [There are rules about what can and cannot be said on broad television or radio (notice that none of these words have anything to do with religion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_dirty_words). But as far as premium channels (HBO) or adult rated (R rated) movies go, the expectation is that this is for mature audiences and there are absolutely no restrictions. I think there are maybe two explanations for this, the first is what /r/lucav92 is expressing, which is: true art should reflect the most realistic dialogue given the context/character speaking them. The second possibility is simply because we just don't have words like bestemmie that are held to a higher tier of offensiveness. Maybe its because of both?

As for me personally using bestemmie? When I'm in Italy I don't use them, regardless of who I'm with. They scare me because I don't understand them. I feel like there is too much possibility for me to miss social cues of when and when they are not acceptable. Certain times I've heard friends use a bestemmia every sentence and I begin to believe that they are somewhat acceptable among friends, but I've also come across groups of friends that use parolacci regularly but would never say a bestemmia and would be offended if I did.

The deal is not good for Greece in the long term but it avoids an immediate humanitarian disaster and long-term political instability on the continent. It may not be the perfect deal that the US would like to see re: continued austerity and debt, but certainly was not the worst outcome for the US' interests in Europe. Meddling now by forcing the IMF to pull out and risking massive instability is not how the US plays. Too much risk with little reward.

The Commission and the Parliament find for example the whole idea of Net Neutrality unimportant, especially if it concerns telco companies trying to charge some online companies a bit more if they want prioritized access to a network. All companies quickly realized this, and even Microsoft/Skype shifted their position from being for net neutrality to being in favor of allowing telco's to ask a bit more money if you want your packets to be treated preferentially.

[Germany-bashing: a fatal distraction](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/germany-bashing-a-fatal-distraction/16681)

&gt;Remember, the EU’s postwar precursor, the European Coal and Steel Community, was established to rein Germany in, and immerse it in supranational structures, and thereby neuter it - an outcome aided by Germany’s postwar division into East and West. 

&gt;Even the Euro itself was the result of European and, in particular, French anxiety about the threat of a re-unified Germany, which economically and culturally was still the powerhouse at the centre of the continent. The price Germany had to pay for reunification in the early 1990s, exacted by then French president Francois Mitterand, was being bound to a single European currency, and, in effect, deeper trans-Europe political and economic structures. 

&gt;But, as we now can see, the problem of Germany’s economic and cultural sway in the context of a weak Europe has not gone away; it has simply re-emerged in a new, Eurozoned form.

&gt;So an honest, sober political debate needs to be had, a debate about the very meaning and purpose of the structures of the EU. But the debate we are too often seeing right now, in which Germany is characterised as little more than a fancy-dress-shop version of its 1930s self, is not that debate. It prevents that debate. It allows too many to settle on the simplistic story of bad Germans doing bad things to poor Greeks or Spaniards, or whoever is next up as Germany’s victim of the month.

[Und hier zu Krugman konkret:](http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2012/06/17/the-greek-vote-blame-germany-and-the-forgotten-reforms/)

&gt;A recent study by Credit Suisse shows that Germany has at risk almost a quarter of its GDP if the worst-case Euro scenario plays out. That is the equivalent of the United States risking four trillion dollars of its own money! I doubt that the Obama administration could have put that sum at risk even during the halcyon days of its first two years. Placed in this context, the Obama administration should understand Angela Merkel’s reluctance to be drawn even deeper into this quicksand.

&gt;Despite these overlooked facts, “blame Germany” has become a rewarding past time for Western-hemisphere liberals. New York Times columnist, Paul Krugman, leads a shrill campaign against German “fantasies of prosperity through pain” and insistence that “their failed strategy is the only responsible thing to do.”

Basically it goes like this. Greece exits (because it has essentially been forced out). the eurozone then turns into an exchange-rate-mechanism. The markets plays ""who is the weakest"" and pick you off one by one. Portugal is the next weakest. Your bond rates will soar, which means you won't be able to borrow from the markets (a repeat of 2012). So you'll have to go to the Troika for some more money. They'll waterboard you to encourage the others. And so it goes.

Of course if the eurozone was really serious about being a permanent currency and really serious about being paid back, they wouldn't have been behaved the way they have.

The best way a creditor gets paid back is if they person who owes them debt is earning. That's why they abolished debtors prisons - can't earn while in prison. That's why Texas used to have a provision in it's constitution that baillifs can't take your house, horse and tools - cause you need to live, work and get to work.

But the eurozone has done the opposite. Lets close their banks, that will teach them, chortle, chortle. All you've done is slowed their economy, made it harder for them to pay you back and made Grexit more likely. Same thing with the punitive taxes on their most profitable industries. In recessions you *cut* taxes to stimulate growth, you don't raise them.

And all the while people like you are cheerleading the torture. ""What fun, we're really teaching them a lesson, etc"".

I believe they were sincere in their wish to get a 'new deal' for Greece, and that they severely over-estimated the leverage they had to negotiate with.

This still does not answer the question of Syriza is better than the other parties. Another aspect of a government that is especially relevant in this situation is reliability and trust. Only a trustworthy and reliable government gives the creditors confidence that the results of negotiations are actually implemented in legislation as agreed. The fact that the Greek government came late with several proposals and just days before the final deadline decided to hold a referendum did not build trust and an impression of reliability. I am not convinced that the current government would not have unilateral decided that they could soften the agreed measures, similar to previous governments.

&gt; Fair in this context for me would mean, what is the best possible outcome for all European citizens?

Is creating a precedence to repeatedly bail out a country the best possible outcome for all EU citizens? The long term result could be that next time there is a financial crisis or economical deficit there will be less incentive to solve this situation if the solution could be unpopular, because there would be the expectation of being bailed out like Greece. There are a lot of people in eastern EU countries that feel that the Greek bailout is less harsher than their own, they might also feel a desire to renegotiate 'better' terms.

&gt; or something, for the populations of, say, Germany or the Netherlands who have seen no quantifiable negatives from the lending to Greece, apart from the number of sensational headlines in the newspapers.

Should they see quantifiable negatives? Sure, there is solidarity. Would you give your give your daughter a huge load, right after she lost all her savings due to irresponsible spending, for the third time? Probably not. Sure the situation is a little more complex. But with all this talk about a debt haircut we also speak about the possibility that the creditors will actually *lose* money and do see very quantifiable negatives. Likewise with the talks about how the debt is unsustainable. If there was a Grexit today and the creditors would write off the debt they would loose money. Assuming there will be another rescue package and there will be a Grexit in the future the creditors will lose *more* money.

But I am getting a vague impression that the ECB (or is it just EZ members?  I don't understand the process by which the initial bailout flowed) tried dumping losses on the IMF, and that the IMF is trying to transfer them back to the ECB.

That's based on the fact that:

* One of the papers analyzing the fallout that I've read (Chicago University) stated that Europe might lose its permanent leadership of the IMF, as there were IMF members who were very unhappy with how Greece was treated, and felt that it received special treatment because it was part of Europe.

* The private lenders effectively unloaded losses onto the central banks and the IMF; the IMF became involved because theoretically Greece could have been rescued. Now it seems to me that the IMF wants the ECB to eat losses that the IMF took (and possibly shouldn't have taken) by having the ECB purchase Greek debt owed the IMF.

* The IMF is resisting further IMF money going into Greece; it'd be fine with having the ECB purchase debt owed to the IMF, though.

It feels kind of like hot potato has been played with the losses, and that at least some of the effort involved has really been to try to figure out how to shift those losses.

I also don't totally understand the process by which the harm that lenders collapsing would have is evaluated, but certainly I got the impression that in the United States, lenders were effectively making use of US credit without actually having any such real obligation on the line.  That is, it seems like there's an awful lot of work going on to shuffle losses around, and it seems like nations tend to be at the bottom rung in terms of resisting taking on losses.

On the other hand, I have not seen anyone who would be familiar with the processes involved say explicitly that losses are being juggled from party to party, aside from the initial transfer of losses from national banks to taxpayers in the Greece situation.

I do wish I had some sort of plausible-sounding explanation, but it seems to require a lot of familiarity with what is reasonable and expected with these institutions in emergency situations.

Also, there are unfortunately an awful lot of heated and angry, perhaps intentionally-biased or uninformed claims floating around that make it hard for me to make out what could be seen as legitimate and what could be seen as not legitimate.",null,0,null,1436921845,null,0,1436924551,0,ct3mkhw,null,t3_3dax6x,null,t1_ct3mkhw,null,t3_3dax6x,null,null,null,1437859459,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null
