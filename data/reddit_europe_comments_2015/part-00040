Therefore the situation with Pakistanis traveling to Sweden on tourist visa seems to be a rather grim one. Though I do believe this is rather standard for many countries of origin (poor ones) and the whole EU. This is nothing special. 

In my opinion our current nationalized world is rather bad at ""good governance"" in a globalized society. Leading to the current global financial feudalism that we experience. The effective restrictions in freedom of movement for a large part of the population of the world is just one small outcome. There are many more.

I'd say the creditor/surplus countries have pushed their interests too much at the expense of others. Benefited the most from free trade and the single currency and absolutely refused to pay any of the costs associated with a monetary union. 

After 5 years of dictating policy for the whole Eurozone, the only thing they talk about is more austerity. I understand that you guys think that the whole Hartz IV route is objectively the best and everyone should do exactly that. But if you're unwilling to accept that's just your opinion and compromise, then at least don't give lessons on how good compromises are and how countries should not be pushing their interests too much at the expense of others. It's a double standard. 

&gt; same happened with the Bundesbank and QE

You call that a compromise? 5 years of austerity, the union close to deflation, unemployment through the roof... and the only compromise your country has made is allow for some QE which is: 

1. not a very good solution to the problem in general but especially unsuited for Europe

Second: please tell me when I interpret something you said differently, I'm not trying to strawman you.

&gt; Nationalism and people being proud of their own countries are a consequence of a lack of education and deep indoctrination.

As I stated before, it is human instinct to form groups and nations. After all, cooperation means survival. In the far past, people often decided to form a group within natural borders such as seas, rivers and mountain ranges. Within these territories cultures developed and nations came into existence. (Please note that states and nations are not the same thing. A group of people can form a nation but not have a state of their own, Kurdistan or Tibet for example). 

There is disussion about the definition of nation but one that is often used is this one: ""A group of people who feel connected by common traits and who want to form or stay a political union."" 

What followed was war: often times a war would start because one nation would see that the other nation had an abundance of something they didn't have, and they would go to war to try and claim the other nation's territory. Another cause for wars is simply expansion of power. Conquering land meant more power. 

The consequense of this was that nations with their own culture became absorbed into the territory of another nation. This is why nations are not the same as states. For example, the nation Tibet exists within the Chinese state, the nation Catalonia exists within the Spanish state, and the nation Kurdistan exists in the states Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Armenia. These are nations that lost the 'game' and became part of larger states.

And yes, nationalism can be a result of indoctrination, like the kind of nationalism in Germany during the Nazi regime. This kind of nationalism, however, has not naturally grown and should not be considered equal to the kind of nationalism described above.

&gt; Over time people will stop identifying with their nations, because it's really just bullshit. More and more people will wake up and realize what idiocy patriotism/nationalism is.

People have an emotion that is called 'beloningness'. It is a powerful emotional need for community, to belong to a certain group of people. It is belongingness that makes people proud of their nation and identify with it. It is the feeling you get when your national football team wins the world cup, it's why people feel more at ease within their own country than in another. A lack of belonging can lead to crime, depression and a range of mental health problems.

This is why I said that you made the situation seem more simple than it actually was. This crucial part of human nature is one of our most basic needs and will lead to severe consequences if ignored.

&gt; I am no more a ""German"" than you are. We are both humans and our heritage shouldn't matter. We are all born on the same planet.

Regardless of whether it should or shouldn't matter, it actually still **does** matter. Belongingness, as described above, causes French people to prefer French culture and to be around other Frenchmen that share their culture. Same with Germans, Russians, Kurds, Catalonians and all other nations in this world.

Regardless of all I just said, there is a noticable trend in history towards bigger states and the disappearance of smaller nations. The miniscule nation-states of the past have fused into larger states and globalisation seems unavoidable. (One example is the unification of Germany).

And guess what: I'm perfectly okay with that. This process has  been happening for a very long time, but there is one difference: it is not being forced upon people like the kind of globalisation that the EU likes so much.

This forced kind of globalisation is also the cause of the surge of right wing parties across Europe. The political elite in European countries think that they know what is best for the people, but they ignore the concerns that many of these people have. These people feel like their opinion doesn't matter to the political elite, and will start to look towards others that offer a solution: populists and rightwing radicalists.

What I would recommend to the politicians in the EU is as follows: Do not think you know what is best for the people of your countries, do not force them to accept what they don't want, but listen to them and act accordingly.

&gt; Does it matter?
It's also human nature to rape and murder each other.
It's also human nature to shit and not wipe his ass.
It's also human nature to not brush his teeth.

As explained above, it **does** matter, regardless of whether you want it to matter or not.
That is why I said I didn't want to live in a world without national pride. Because it destroys my sense of belonging and will lead to nothing good.

&gt; I factually described you as a hateful bigot (which you are if you actually have the believes you expressed). If that insults you, maybe you should try and stop being a hateful bigot.

I have no idea where you got the idea that I am a hateful bigot. First of all I don't discriminate against anyone. In my opinion people deserve equal treatment and equal opportunity. Secondly I hold no hate whatsoever for anyone that has not given me reason to. I'm very much interested in different cultures and people, and that's exactly why I do not wish to see them disappear.
So yes, your **factually incorrect** statement is insulting.

&gt; You... are a political science student?
A political science student says things like ""A globalised world without borders or without national pride is not a world I want to live in.""?
I think it's time to give up all hope for humanity. For human society's sake I hope you are just in your first year or something.

The message I get from this: ""Wow this guy holds different viewpoints than me, he can't be a student"". Sounds kind of bigoted to me.

Let me tell you this: the academic world is a giant chaotic mess of different opinions constantly arguing with one another. It should not come as a surprise to you that some people do not agree with you. My viewpoints aren't unique either.

&gt;I don't care about aggression, I care about arguments.
You can be as aggressive as you like as long as you have rational arguments.

Agression leads to an unpleasant environment to have discussions in. It leads to emotion clouding peoples' rational judgment.

I'm interested in hearing what you have to say and await your response.
Let's hope we can learn something from one another.

ps. As stated in the beginning, I'm not trying to strawman you. So if I misinterpreted any of your statements please do tell.

Wenn wir eine bessere Welt anstreben, dann müssen wir aufhören, mit zweierlei Maß zu messen. Doppelmoral ist der Nährboden des Terrorismus.

* Es ist doppelbödig, wenn wir Anschlagsopfer muslimischer Täter im Herzen des europäischen Kontinents öffentlich betrauern, die Millionen Opfer westlicher Weltordnungskriege aber als unvermeidlich hinnehmen.

* Es ist doppelbödig, wenn nach Verbrechen muslimischer Täter reflexartig an die muslimischen Verbände appelliert wird ""Distanziert euch, andernfalls werdet ihr in Mithaft genommen!"". Gab es entsprechende Distanzierungsaufrufe an christliche Gemeinden bei Bekanntwerden der NSU-Morde an Immigranten?

* Es ist doppelbödig, wenn wir arabische Diktaturen, die weitab von unserem Menschenrechtsverständnis leben, mit modernsten Waffen beliefern, obwohl wir wissen, dass mit ihnen dschihadistische Organisationen ausgerüstet werden, die unsere Werte brutal bekämpfen. Dass wir dafür Öl und blutverschmiertes Geld bekommen, macht den Deal nicht besser.

* Es ist doppelbödig, wenn wir den das Völkerrecht verachtenden Staat Israel mit atomar ausrüstbaren U-Booten beschenken und bei seinen Rechtsbrüchen wegschauen. Schwerste eigene Schuld aus dunklen Zeiten kann dieses Verhalten nicht rechtfertigen.

* Es ist doppelbödig, wenn wir der USA bei völkerrechtswidrigen Kriegen Beistand gewähren. Es ist unverantwortlich, weil wir um die Gräuel von Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo und sonstiger Foltergefängnisse sowie um die garantierte Straflosigkeit der politisch Verantwortlichen wissen.

* Es ist doppelbödig, wenn wir den grauenvollen Massenmord des christlich-fundamentalistischen Psychopathen Anders Breivik, der Europa vor dem Islam schützen wollte, anders bewerten als Gewaltakte muslimischer Terroristen. Damals gab es nämlich trotz der 77 Mordopfer keinen internationalen Trauermarsch vergleichbar dem von Paris? Was wäre aber gewesen, wenn kein Norweger, sondern ein Araber den Massenmord begangen hätte? Die Hysterie wäre vermutlich grenzenlos gewesen.

* Und ja, es ist auch doppelbödig, wenn wir terroristische Attentäter stereotyp als feige und hinterhältig bezeichnen. Ist es etwa mutiger, wenn ein Todesvollstrecker im sicheren Befehlsstand auf einen Knopf drückt, um einen in großer Entfernung vermuteten Gotteskrieger mittels Drohne zu ermorden? Im Übrigen ist das, was bei uns als feige und hinterhältig eingestuft wird, die Folge davon, dass die terroristischen Einzeltäter weder über Drohnen noch über Jagdflugzeuge und Kampfpanzer verfügen. Es ist zu vermuten, dass sie ihre zur Selbstvernichtung führenden Sprengstoffgürtel gerne gegen modernes Kriegsgerät austauschen würden.

In terms of selection and abundancy clearly the Soviet states fared much worse.

&gt; I remember the huge advertising campaigns we got in the early- to mid-90s when they started shipping oranges from Spain.

That's an example of *brand marketing*, which means that not only was there an abundant supply of oranges but also different brands of oranges from different producers that had to compete for the market share. Hence the Jaffa, Maroc etc brand advertising campaigns.

&gt; (We got bananas, because they could be shipped over months from Brazil, but very few other things survived that journey fresh.)

Wut? Only Brazilian bananas and Spanish oranges? In which country have you lived in? I mean my mother worked in fruit business already in the early '70s, and clearly the selection and the countries of origin was far more plentiful than you seem to remember.

What was very different then was the *seasonal variation*. In those days fruits were basically only available on the market during the right season (e.g. lot of cheap oranges during winter etc), and outside the season only at high prices if at all. During the decades this seasonal variation has become less significant albeit it still exists.

Wether they are making money of it remains to be seen if they ever pay it back. 

If they start cutting in debt or threatening with default, I'm glad we at least recieved some by now in interest.

&gt; By being extortionists It doesn't help the ""those lazy greeks"" framing of debate when in fact they are coming out with a monetary advantage from austerity

Right, Greeks are corrupt, that has always been a problem. This makes the currency Union unfit for them. They are not lazy, they are simply liars and decievers, trying everything to not pay anything to tax, while seeing what they can harvest from anyone else. As a consequense, I have to pay extra tax because Greeks don't. I don't find that a desirable situation, sorry.

&gt; by making things harder on Greece it's clear they are only damaging their economy and making the long term viability of the loans less likely. 

There doesn't seem to be another way. Since any other way would involve defaulting, or getting even more loans. 

&gt; these loans could easily be replaced/bought out by the ECB and their stimulus packages which would carry 0% interest afaik.

No, that is illegal and prohibited under EU treaties. When embarking upon QE, every state may buy up the relative size of the package to proportion of what he owns of the ECB. 

This way sees to it that there will be no transfer of wealth. And indeed, I support that to the fullest. They pay for their own, as we do, or get lost.

&gt; Hell I'm Finnish and even with my conflicting position I can see how charging interest in a deflating eurozone is a bad idea

If you really want to become a filmmaker or involved in broadcasting and film in general, French cinema is always essential.

Hollywood blockbusters still owes alot from French cinema. Spielberg, Lucas, Scorcese and Coppola all started from studying the works of Truffaut, Godard and Bunuel. 

And a lot of French film aesthetics are present in today's cinema. For example, the Guardians of the Galaxy movie features ships designed by Chris Foss, who started his career in the French film industry doing design and artwork for Alejandro Jodorowsky and Michel Seydoux's Dune.

France still churns out amazing talents. Jean Dujardin, Giles Lellouche,  Melanie Laurent, etc. alongside great directors like Francois Ozon and Gaspar Noe.

Everyone who studies film and cinema in general has to see at least a few French films in their lifetime. My favourite French films of course are:

-Tirez sur Le Pianiste (1960) Dir. Truffaut

-Le Dernier Metro (1980) Dir. Truffaut

-Enter the Void (2011) Dir. Noe

-The Chorus (2004) Dir. Barratier

-Days of Glory (2006) Dir. Bouchareb

-La Haine (1995) Dir. Kassovitz

I will say it once more and maybe it will kick in...The current debt load on Greece is simply not payable under any circumstance, as you rightly point out the bond yields on greek bonds prove that.

Do you disagree with the market and think EU thought their money comes with sparkles and glitter than make it immune to market forces. Just because the EU lends money doesn't make greek debt any more sustainable.
They have been in default for 5 years and lending more money to their broken banks wont fix it.

The cost is the wellbeing of a whole lot of Greek people and creating an extremely hostile political climate in Europe, with lies and made up reasons to why Greeks have to suffer for what, intended or not, is a huge benefit for the German economy.

The European states were complicit in that as well as the Greek government at the time. If not for their dangerous gambling, Greece wouldn't have been in the currency union to begin with.  
  Let me explain that in layman terms:  
If for example you run a business with declining trade, you run red numbers and have no optimistic measures to explore new markets, a bank is not going to give you a loan to pay off another loan.  

Let's assume the bank decides to give you a loan anyway, and you apply for insolvency. The bank lost its investment. Shame on them, they made a bad business decision and have to pay for it. That's the risk of investment.
Now, with Greece, that's been the case: though, in contrast to my example, the banks were not held liable, but the public.

If you are in economic perile, you want to take a loan so to invest and access new business opportunities. That's basically the Marshall Plan (extremely simplified).

However, confrontational as good interviews might be, this was rude, constantly interrupting and unnecessarily aggressive. Plus, as the opening feature shows a pathetic attempt to portray Greece as an irresponsible child of a nation that, apparently, owes explanations to everybody. Is that journalism? Maybe in Buzzfeed, but in the BBC?

&gt;The interviewee wants to avoid public commitments that might come back to bite them in the arse and the interviewer wants to try and pin down clear declarations.

What public commitments does a Greek Minister owe to British viewers? Well, none.

Go to[ this website](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/), and choose German.

CTRL+F for ""W0"", and find all the decks labeled ""W0x - For english speaking children"" (replacing x for 1,2..8). Download all of these decks, and open them in Anki.

Next, go to the same website and search for ""VHS German x updated"" where x = 1,2,3,4

Now, you will also be needing the addon called ""AwesomeTTS"".

In Anki do the following: Tools &gt; Addons &gt; Browse &amp; Install.

In the box type in ""301952613"" and press okay.

Restart Anki.

I will leave it up to you how to work the addon (it's very easy) but you will be able to browse through the entire deck and create high quality audio of a German speaking voice for each card which helps greatly in memorisation.


Those are the decks that I currently learn from. Unfortunatley the VHS series doesn't contain pictures or audio. Audio is sorted through AwesomeTTS but for images you will have to add them yourself. What I do is I search Google images for each new card I learn every day so little by little I will eventually have the deck filled up with full audio and images and I will reupload it. That will take some time however, as there are like 1500 cards in each one!

If you would like, I can upload the images I have found so far and you can use them. I also recommend on each card changing the German to different colours.

Credo che se fai una cosa opzioniale non avresti i soldi per gestire la rete di trasporti. Inoltre è un incentivo per usarli, se paghi perchè non usarlo? Anche io vivo fuori città quindi uso poco i mezzi pubblici, ma almeno avrei una qualità dell'aria maggiore.

I think that is because there's simply no quick way out. (and it's okay by the way, I may have responded a bit harsh too, lets forget that part)

Whatever happens, it's a difficult proces. The thing is, the monetary Union is all nice and great but the Eurozone was formed without much thought given to what a monetary Union should behold. It was implemented wrong. In 2008 it was clear the Eurozone was not equiped nor designed to go through a crisis, simply because it wasn't really a monetary Union, it lacks far too much convergence, not just fiscal transfers. 

So they made some gigantic projects to see if they could hold the Eurozone together, well 6 years further here we are, the tape runs everywhere to keep the shards together, unemployment levels have surpassed those of the great depression in the 30s in some parts, countries like Italy are economically below what they where in 1999, and frankly, there's no recovery, most of the rest still haven;t recovered from 2008, and are far below 2008 numbers.

There is no growth like the US, only growth of debt and deficits. The Eurozone is completely grounded, all life sucked out of it. 

Now people all start saying ""lets do fiscal transfers"". To a country that hasn't yet figured out how to collect taxes, and it's population doesn't even know what paying taxes means. Fiscal transfers are not a solution, besides it's too late to implement them, and it wasn't the Union we envisaged either considering the treaties.

The Eurozone doesn't fit in a fiscal Union, no matter how many ideals we have. Everything from mentality, work ethos, laws, tax systems, wealth distribitution it's worlds apart. 

And I see forming that mess into some kind of ball as a downright crime to humanity. It will destroy Europe. There's no way The Netherlands could function under the same fiscal and tax system as the Greeks. Cultural we are too diverse. 

So I say we break it up, form other currency Unions or our own for some. 

That may not be a popular opinion, but the Eurozone is dead in the water, the continuous decline needs to stop. We need to find a way up again, and breaking the Eurozone is that thing which we need.",null,0,null,1422714631,null,0,1422715391,0,co6qxji,null,t3_2u988g,null,t1_co6qxji,null,t1_co6qr97,null,null,null,1424289599,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

It angers me that a German newspaper would report this, totaly ignoring the sacrificies we are subject to , I open a portuguese newspaper today and first thing i find ""Portuguese levels of poberty are back to the same numbers as 10 years ago"" and ""Lack of state suport to handicaps revolts low income families"". Germans may agree with austery, it is their right but do so fully knowing the consequences it brings to your fellow european citizens.

This said the structural reforms are bringing some results, portuguese companies are more competitive now then before 2008, the fiscal evasion is lower then it ever was, the energy market is somewhat more competitive, the lack of funds ended with alot of waste at the public sector and much more.

Another thing that Europeans seem to forget is that Greece needs money and Russia happens to be a great importer of Greek goods. A market that has collapsed with the sanctions. Russian tourist traffic is down by 80% and Greek agriculture lost millions. So it is not about Greece aligning with Putin, it is about Greece trying to protect its financial interests that are jeopardized by a situation that Greece does not consider vital at the moment.

Seriously. Noone understands the system, literally: Its interpretation is managed by assigning one public servant each to about every single subsection of the tax code and its interaction with the rest, then making decisions by circular letter.

They don't need to. Their ""ghost army"" tactics seem to work pretty well so far. If the west doesn't do something concrete about it, they'll more than likely continue to take territories bit by bit, the west will continue to lose credibility and before you know it, we'll have the Soviet Union 2.0.

&gt;Russia does, however, have the capability to point missiles at every European capital in case any of the more aggressive variant of ""meds"" are applied and Putin gets desperate. They'll have that ability no matter how bad the economy gets, and as they get more desperate they'll get more trigger happy too.

That would pretty much be suicide, because NATO would also nuke every city in Russia, creating a radioactive cloud that would wipe out most life on earth, especially human life. MAD is still a thing, and I doubt any country on earth, including Russia would want to wipe itself out for some political differences. 

I don't think NATO should attempt to invade Russia, but they could definitely send some heavy weapons the Ukrainians could use. 

&gt;How can you be frightened of Russian invasion, but at the same time feel like pushing them to a breaking point and escalating a lethal global conflict is somehow not going to get us all screwed?

null,false,didijustobama,FINL,Finland,null,"&gt;The Eurozone doesn't fit in a fiscal Union, no matter how many ideals we have. Everything from mentality, work ethos, laws, tax systems, wealth distribitution it's worlds apart.
And I see forming that mess into some kind of ball as a downright crime to humanity. It will destroy Europe. There's no way The Netherlands could function under the same fiscal and tax system as the Greeks. Cultural we are too diverse.
So I say we break it up, form other currency Unions or our own for some.
That may not be a popular opinion, but the Eurozone is dead in the water, the continuous decline needs to stop. We need to find a way up again, and breaking the Eurozone is that thing which we need.

agree 100%, I would even go a step further and say the Euro ruined europe as countries like Greece who really should not have access to cheap money on markets suddenly got access to it when the euro came into effect, 

politicians there and elsewhere simply didn't have the responsibility to handle this gracefully and instead expanded programs with the aim of wining votes and staying in power.

I also put a lot of blame on this current generation of Europeans. In the 90's and 00's I seen a lot of jobs come online during the boom years in europe that I would essentially call fluff jobs, they were created in the public service but served no real meaning and now we cant really do away with them either.

I renewed my driving licence last year after 10 years, it took three times as much money and two times as many offices to get the same thing.

One thing I learned today is that in the Netherlands they work shorter hours than a lot of europe but they do a lot more social and charity work for free, In my view I think it's time here in europe we did away with a lot of the costly state services like carers and lunchladys and brought that sort of work back to family's and volunteer groups like how the church functioned in society before maybe 50 years ago.

I like many in the left do reject longer working hours and austerity but I'm very pro community and pro co-operation, I think we are at a crossroads in Europe where either we commoditize everything and go the way of the USA or we take a step back, work less and live our own lives more. I have always felt civil society was much more important to us Europeans than anywhere else in the world and right now that has been transferred to state responsibility, to make society feasible we need to shoulder that burden ourselves and not monetize it. 

unfortunately I feel like everything this whole crisis will be used by the free market capitalist class to divide and conquer nations and ultimately do more damage to all europe and it's institutions than if we stuck this out together. This last paragraph is my socialist rhetoric coming out and It's the same solidarity I see starting to emerge in Greece today. 

At the end of the day I say if you want greek people to pay their taxes make them proud of their country and want to fix it, I think syriza are the only hope of achieving that. as a socialist I don't care about money or wealth, I care about people and lives. In terms of ideology it's amazing how far to the fiscal right europe has tilted in 20 years and this has degraded society everywhere to the point you have nazi's popping up in Germany again.

I this this is where we differ, I really don't care about the debt as I refuse to be drawn in to an ""us vs them"" attitude, if anything I would like to embrace real European solidarity but we are moving more and more closer to the situation of fracture you describe which WILL be worse for everyone in the end.

...except, that if Ukrainians do leave that region alone and say ""hell with that, be independent, whatevs"", they (together with Russia) will push Westwards as it already happened. Mariupol, Odesa, and so on. Basically Ukrainians do not trust Putin to stop at the current positions separatists hold (and why should they?).

Another argument Ukrainians have, that though it might seem this way (anti-Ukr pro-Rus population), actually most of them would rather be with Ukraine, though personally for me it's hard to believe. My understanding is that pro-EU sentiments in that region are extremely minimal, and it would be truly better for Ukraine to cut them lose in all aspects, if hypothetically there would be a guarantee they do not push Westwards anymore.",null,0,null,1422716396,null,0,false,0,co6rit3,null,t3_2uaaun,null,t1_co6rit3,null,t1_co6qna6,null,null,null,1424289323,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

So it's not that more people are finding jobs because of more investment and gross capital formation / capital utilization, but that the unemployed are leaving the country, thus the labor force is shrinking, thus the presently employed become a bigger percentage of it, even though new jobs weren't created.

Technically you could bring down the unemployment rate of a country to zero, by shrinking the labor force faster than you would shrink employment. If 1 person is fired for every two people that are leaving the country, at some point you will have no unemployed people in your country. You would have negative job creation, but the unemployment rate would still view this as decreased unemployment because the workforce would shrink faster. However that would be a sign of a dying people, not of success.

Now, this may be a matter of a shrinking population in general, and not of a shrinking labor-force in specific. I don't know whether that correction would be cause for celebration, however. Frankly, the idea of reaching a low unemployment equilibrium by means of decreasing the population of a country faster and faster (and possibly causing irreparable damage to its long term demographic trends) sounds more like post-modern genocide, than recuperation.",null,0,null,1422716402,null,0,false,0,co6riuv,null,t3_2u7ky9,null,t1_co6riuv,null,t1_co6n00u,null,null,null,1424289323,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

null,false,Confoederationis,NETH,Verenigd Koninkrijk der Nederlanden,null,"&gt; agree 100%, I would even go a step further and say the Euro ruined europe as countries like Greece who really should not have access to cheap money on markets suddenly got access to it when the euro came into effect, 

I agree. Right at the start Greece had a troublesome state debt, right at the start they knew Greece was cooking the books, it was all no surprise that that busted eventually. 

&gt; I also put a lot of blame on this current generation of Europeans. In the 90's and 00's I seen a lot of jobs come online during the boom years in europe that I would essentially call fluff jobs, they were created in the public service but served no real meaning and now we cant really do away with them either.

Yeah, many economic policies work from the idea that employment is way to transfer wealth. Which is idiotic, if it doesn't add anything, might as well give the person a welfare check, room for education and help him get a real job. 

&gt; One thing I learned today is that in the Netherlands they work shorter hours than a lot of europe but they do a lot more social and charity work for free, In my view I think it's time here in europe we did away with a lot of the costly state services like carers and lunchladys and brought that sort of work back to family's and volunteer groups like how the church functioned in society before maybe 50 years ago.

This is what our current government calls the ""participation society"". This wasn't always the case, years back we arranged everything collectively, from huge city blocks with ""assistant living"" for elderly, to state paid day care for children etc. 

This has been on the withdraw for the past years since it's unpayable, so a lot of kind volunteers have taken over. 

&gt; I like many in the left do reject longer working hours and austerity but I'm very pro community and pro co-operation, I think we are at a crossroads in Europe where either we commoditize everything and go the way of the USA or we take a step back, work less and live our own lives more. I have always felt civil society was much more important to us Europeans than anywhere else in the world and right now that has been transferred to state responsibility, to make society feasible we need to shoulder that burden ourselves and not monetize it. 

I agree with what you say here. I liked the way one of the Irish politicians said it (don't know which one anymore) but he said ""Austerity has the damaged the thin fabric of our society""

And I agree to that, the same thing happened here, and I find that the biggest loss of the whole crisis, and I think we need to restore it quickly, or it will become a real threat to our rule of law and democracy. 

&gt; unfortunately I feel like everything this whole crisis will be used by the free market capitalist class to divide and conquer nations and ultimately do more damage to all europe and it's institutions than if we stuck this out together. This last paragraph is my socialist rhetoric coming out and It's the same solidarity I see starting to emerge in Greece today. 

For me I feel the whole European porject has been kidnapped by a neo-liberal drive to globalisation, which I detest. 

&gt; At the end of the day I say if you want greek people to pay their taxes make them proud of their country and want to fix it, I think syriza are the only hope of achieving that. as a socialist I don't care about money or wealth, I care about people and lives. In terms of ideology it's amazing how far to the fiscal right europe has tilted in 20 years and this has degraded society everywhere to the point you have nazi's popping up in Germany again.

For one, I agree with the former things you said. The communal society. This is one of the reasons why I personally do not like huge far stretching powerful political entities. 

In my opinion, small states are always best governed. They are transparent, politics is close to everyday life, no overly geo-political matters, power projection or a solution for a problem of the entire continent. 

No The Hague talks about education, and all relevant people are at the table. The ""Polder model"". 

I don't want nor need a giant government in Brussel ruling over Europe. I want Brussel to be a place to converge states where it is needed, efficient, profitable and cooperative. The rest should stay local, transparent, direct and personal. And sure Brussels may eventually get a European army and foreign policy, since we want to stay relevant in the global arena, as long as real governance stays local.

&gt; I this this is where we differ, I really don't care about the debt as I refuse to be drawn in to an ""us vs them"" attitude, if anything I would like to embrace real European solidarity but we are moving more and more closer to the situation of fracture you describe which WILL be worse for everyone in the end.

I also don't really care about the current debt they have, it's just that they shouldn't give anymore money. It should be done now, we wasted billions, millions of people are hard hit.

null,false,jtalin,EURO,Green Europe,null,"&gt; They don't need to. Their ""ghost army"" tactics seem to work pretty well so far. If the west doesn't do something concrete about it, they'll more than likely continue to take territories bit by bit, the west will continue to lose credibility and before you know it, we'll have the Soviet Union 2.0.

Where can that strategy possibly work again? So far the ghost army has only ever managed to chunk of small pieces of territory populated by a moderate amount of sympathizers and people who could be easily affected by Kremlin propaganda where their army could get a foothold and take over from there. The strategy is hardly Europe-threatening. 

&gt; That would pretty much be suicide, because NATO would also nuke every city in Russia, creating a radioactive cloud that would wipe out most life on earth, especially human life. MAD is still a thing, and I doubt any country on earth, including Russia would want to wipe itself out for some political differences.

It's *because* MAD is still a thing that I don't understand how you're feeling so brave to engage a nuclear power to the point where they're facing a potentially existential threat. The principle of MAD is that IF a country has &gt;X nukes, you either leave them alone in their own corner of the world or deal with them very, VERY cautiously. 

If the CCP decided to invade Taiwan tomorrow, we would also sit back, watch and do nothing except offer deep concerns and hope the situation can be resolved peacefully. 

That's just how the world works. It's the only way the world *can* work for the foreseeable future.

&gt; I don't think NATO should attempt to invade Russia, but they could definitely send some heavy weapons the Ukrainians could use.

But then the Russians will send their own heavy weapons, maintaining the status quo. If both sides then continue to overload Ukraine with more weaponry, the whole country will be turned into rubble soaked with (mostly Ukrainian) blood. I thought the goal was to avoid that.

&gt; Russia needs to be taught a lesson. It needs to realize it cannot fuck with the west whenever and however it wants and that playing by the rules will benefit everyone in the long run.

What's needed and what's realistic are two different things. It's extremely arrogant and reckless to see Russia as someone who can be ""taught a lesson"" just like that. If they haven't been taught a lesson by the Soviet Union era and if they haven't been taught a lesson by crippling economic situation they are in now, they ain't going to be taught a lesson before all hell breaks loose. 

You're operating from some position of superiority / invincibility that doesn't exist in reality. If your enemy possesses the means to wipe you out, they **always** have leverage, and you can only gamble on MAD so far. Ask South Korea what living under such a threat is like.

There's a lot of things that European countries can do to *protect* themselves from the aggression. Outlawing financial support for political parties from Russia, placing individuals suspected to be loyal to Russia under heavy surveillance, disarming the population, reinforcing the borders, and so on.

So the vote is still anonymous, but the vote can be verified, because it is only readable with the public key of the key pair.

Those are just off the top of my head. I guess some expert group giving it more though could come up with a longer list.

True, true. People in the thread just seemed to be comparing present day to 80s Romania, not 80s Romania to 80s [random country here] so I thought to talk about this subject.

&gt;Wut? Only Brazilian bananas and Spanish oranges? In which country have you lived in? I mean my mother worked in fruit business already in the early '70s, and clearly the selection and the countries of origin was far more plentiful than you seem to remember. What was very different then was the seasonal variation. In those days fruits were basically only available on the market during the right season (e.g. lot of cheap oranges during winter etc), and outside the season only at high prices if at all. During the decades this seasonal variation has become less significant albeit it still exists.

Well, there were others, but all in all my memories of the HeVi-isle is mostly potatoes, salad-rolls, apples and bananas, with cucumbers and tomatoes if in season.  Keep in mind that we weren't by any measure a RICH family (what with loans and all) and neither was our neighbourhood. Any vegetables and fruits that were even a little more expensive were probably sold somewhere else than where we brought our business.

The point however, was to illustrate that not a single country has a clear conscience, we can go back years in history to point out times where every state has acted out of self-interest and total disregard to other states sovereignty. I'm not defending the pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, in hind sight we can all certainly agree that it was a poor decision, which combined with the Soviet Union occupying parts of Eastern Europe agitated the local population. I suspect much of the current Russia-phobia stems from this. 

But the Soviet actions during the Cold War was all part of the struggle between the Soviet Union and the USA. Your feelings for the Soviet Union and what is known today as Russia, is replicated by several countries in Asia and the Middle East. Where the power struggle between the Soviet Union and USA led to several instances where local states had their sovereignty violated. The US intervention in Vietnam and the subsequent Vietnam War or the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan are two key examples of foreign intervention by the two superpowers that was against the will of the local population. 

Thankfully Soviet Union no longer exists and instead we have Russia, which unlike the United States has drastically cut back the frequency of which it intervenes in another states affairs. Looking past the alleged Russian intervention in Ukraine, we have to go back at least 20 years to find instances where Russia has intervened in another states affairs. I know the typical response here is lambasting this as stupid 'what about' policy. But this is because the response here is VERY anti Russian whereas instances where other states have done wrongdoings are simply ignored or accepted here.

If we cannot trust this indicator enough, why not take the one you provided: total employed persons only relative to the population? The dynamic will still be positive.  
  
&gt;It's thousands of kids not born due to incompetent policy.   
  
That is a bold statement. Let's just make one thing clear: we are limiting the scope of the discussion to the austerity policy developed by IMF for Latvia in 2009 (because this is what we are discussing, right?).

Three things happened in Latvia in 2008/09 that brought the country to the brink of default:  
1)  Burst of a huge property bubble  
2)  Bankruptcy of Parex - one of the country's largest banks  
3)  World financial crisis  

When our government struck a bailout deal with IMF, Latvia's foreign reserves were nearly completely gone and it was getting impossibly expensive for Latvia to borrow money on the markets.  
In other words - a month or two from a default.  
  
What would happen to birth rates after a full collapse of the economy? Can we know exact figures? No. It can be not unreasonably speculated though that birth rate would plummet hard.  

The bailout prevented the complete collapse and austerity measures helped cut the budget deficit from 10% in 2010 to a sustainable 1% in 2014 [source](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/latvia/government-budget).  
  
&gt;Your population will keep on shrinking just because your deaths are higher than your births.  
  
Well that is completely true and has been since 1991. But I can't understand what do IMF's austerity measures launched in 2009 have to do with it? Two separate issues.  
  
&gt;Also look at your age structure. You should be having far more children since your most populus generation is currently between 25-34.  
  
First of all, compared to developed countries, Latvia still has a rather low life expectancy. So population is skewed to lower age brackets.  
  
Secondly, what does this have to do with IMF's austerity program launched in 2009?  
  
&gt;Blanchard is the IMF's chief economist and the author of the paper.   
  
Indeed he is. Two things though:  
  
1) Decision in IMF are made by the managing director [Christine Lagarde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde) not by the chief economist.  
  
2) As i cited from the paper, Blanchard specifically states:  
  
&gt;Finally, it is worth emphasizing that deciding on the appropriate stance of fiscal policy requires much more than an assessment regarding the size of short-term fiscal multipliers. Thus, our results should not be construed as arguing for any specific fiscal policy stance in any specific country. In particular, the results do not imply that fiscal consolidation is undesirable. Virtually all advanced economies face the challenge of fiscal adjustment in response to elevated government debt levels and future pressures on public finances from demographic change. The short-term effects of fiscal policy on economic activity are only one of the many factors that need to be considered in determining the appropriate pace of fiscal consolidation for any single country.  
  
In other words - the paper's results (which just state that earlier IMF's economic models may have underestimated the crisis multiplier) should not be used as an argument when taking stance on fiscal policy.   
  
&gt;No it doesn't. 2011 1,285,136 62.1% 2014 1,229,067 61,4%  
  
Well let's look at the bigger picture shall we?  
  
1989 Latvians - 52% Russians - 34%, 2000 Latvians - 57.7%, Russians - 29.6%, 2011 Latvians - 62.1% Russians - 26.9%, 2014 Latvians - 61.4% Russians - 26%.  
  
Since the fall of USSR % of Latvians has been steadily increasing. The loss of 0.7pp from 2011 to 2014 in nothing in comparison with the gain of 9.4pp from 1989 to 2014. In general the trend was strongly in favor of an increase of share of Latvians.  
  
&gt;Well, completely messing up your very last chance for fixing demographics  
  
That is a very strong statement. What specific policy do you think ""completely messed up the chance to fix demographics""?  From my perspective Latvian demographics is in no where near the shape of some more developed countries with advanced stages of population ageing like [Germany](http://www.indexmundi.com/germany/age_structure.html).

Yet there is silence when Ukrainians were doing the same thing for months. The only people who care are the Russian media and they have the same problem. All they care about is civilians on their side. So they show lots of footage and report about civilians being killed by Ukrainian attacks. Kids losing limbs, families obliterated houses destroyed and people in the street dying. This one sided reporting means that a lot of Russians volunteer to fight and to stop the madness.

This is cruel and evil. We need to be serious and report on the civilian casualties on both sides.

**ATHENS**—Greece's finance minister and a representative of its European creditors exchanged grimaces, tough rhetoric and a frosty farewell on Friday, capping a week in which Athens's new antiausterity government roiled its eurozone paymasters almost daily.

But behind the acrimony, clues are emerging about how Athens and its German-led creditors are searching for a deal that keeps Greece in the euro.

The options for a compromise, likely to become more concrete once negotiations get under way in February, include tweaking Greece's budget constraints and debt-service burden while revamping how Europe monitors Greek compliance.

At a news conference on Friday, Greece's outspoken new finance minister , Yanis Varoufakis, clashed over the way forward with his Dutch counterpart Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who heads up meetings of eurozone finance chiefs.

' Nobody wants Greece to default. That's the reason to be hopeful. '
—
Megan Greene
, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management
Mr. Varoufakis dismissed Greece's hitherto-strict bailout regimen as “based on an anti-European logic,” visibly angering the Dutchman, who warned Greece against “unilateral steps and ignoring previous arrangements.” The two men left the room after a perfunctory handshake.

Spats on topics ranging from finances to foreign policy have gotten relations between Greece and the rest of the eurozone off to a rocky start since the left-wing Syriza party won Greek elections on Jan. 25 .

Despite the bad atmospherics, Syriza officials said in private they know they will have to offer a convincing package of economic overhauls and budget discipline in return for financial concessions that will likely fall far short of the party's bolder ambitions.

Nearly all parties to the latest flare-up in Europe's debt crisis want to avoid the consequences of failing to reach agreement: Greece would run out of cash, at the latest by July and August, when close to €7 billion ($7.9 billion) worth of Greek bonds held by the European Central Bank fall due.

Greek Banks May Lose ECB Credit, Says Policy Maker Liikanen
A default on the ECB's bonds would most likely end Greek banks' access to central-bank liquidity, forcing the country out of the euro. Massive economic dislocation in Greece, tens of billions of euros in loan write-offs for creditor countries, and a lasting destabilization of Europe's currency union could follow.

“Nobody wants Greece to default,” said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management and a longtime eurozone-crisis consultant. “That's the reason to be hopeful.”

A deal in coming months is far from certain. A chasm currently separates Syriza's demand to renegotiate the bailout from Europe's insistence on continuity.

The lack of personal or political affinity between Europe's ruling establishment and Greece's rebel government under Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras could hinder the search for common ground, analysts warn.

' The question is the politics: What can Syriza live with, and what can get through parliaments in Germany, Finland and elsewhere? '
—Senior German official
Since Syriza's election triumph, Mr. Tsipras has angered Berlin and other European capitals by picking the nationalistic Independent Greeks as his coalition partner; reversing previous austerity and privatization steps; and disputing a European leaders' communiqué that blamed Russia for the latest escalation in the war in Ukraine .

Hints that Greece under Syriza might lean more strongly toward Moscow have made Europe's foreign-policy elite as nervous as its financial crisis managers this past week.

The choice of Mr. Varoufakis as finance minister also went down badly in Berlin. The sharp-tongued economist, fresh from teaching at the University of Texas at Austin, has long lambasted Germany's approach to the European crisis, describing austerity as “fiscal waterboarding.”

Yet European policy makers and advisers who have begun studying the nitty-gritty say compromises, while difficult, appear possible on the central issues. Those include how tight a budget Greece should run; whether to rejigger Athens's debts to other eurozone governments; which broader overhauls Greece's economy needs; and how creditors should supervise agreed-to policies.

“On the economics, there is room for compromise,” said a senior German official. “The question is the politics: What can Syriza live with, and what can get through parliaments in Germany, Finland and elsewhere?”

Publicly, Syriza has demanded a major restructuring of Greece's bailout loans, but in private, Greek officials say they are hoping for a repetition of concessions Europe has previously made: extending loan maturities and trimming and postponing interest payments.

That would allow Greece to spend a little more and tax a little less than under previous plans, giving its depressed economy some oxygen. European officials say Syriza will still have to curtail some of its spending promises.

Syriza is expected to present its detailed economic policies to Parliament on Feb. 7-9, aiming to convince creditors that it can be trusted to reform the country.

European officials say Syriza's declared reform goals so far—including tackling corruption, tax evasion and cartels—are welcome. But, they say, Greece still needs major surgery in areas Syriza is reluctant to tackle, including the costly pension system.

One of the biggest obstacles is the bailout process itself—typically for the European Union, which often turns thorny political issues into bureaucratic ones.

Since the eurozone debt crisis erupted in 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has insisted on a set of strict bailout procedures that make loans for debtor countries more palatable for German public opinion, but that have become politically toxic in crisis-hit countries.

At Friday's news conference, Mr. Varoufakis underscored Greece's refusal to work any longer with the so-called troika of inspectors from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and ECB. The three institutions have made Greece implement spending cuts and tax increases worth over 30% of gross domestic product in the past five years, according to Greek and EU data.

So far, creditor countries have maintained a hard line, led by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, who said in Berlin on Friday that Germany stands ready to offer Greece solidarity within the existing bailout framework, “but only in this framework and in no other one.”

In private, eurozone officials say a new monitoring system is likely to be needed to replace the troika. Its membership and modus operandi may well change, but the tricky part will be satisfying both Germany's desire for controls and Greece's desire to take ownership of its own policies.

Mr. Schäuble has long been a skeptic about whether Greece can repair itself enough to ever thrive in the eurozone, according to people familiar with his thinking. He is unlikely to signal any flexibility toward Greece before Feb. 15, when a state election in Hamburg could show gains for the antibailout party Alternative for Germany, one of these people said.

Ms. Merkel is more pragmatic than her finance chief, the history of Europe's crisis suggests. In 2012, when Greece came close to a euro exit, Ms. Merkel overruled Mr. Schäuble and opted against pushing Greece out, fearing incalculable fallout. She remains against a “Grexit,” but she needs a cooperative government in Athens that can make Greece more frugal and competitive. Without one, she can't sell continued financial support to Germans, Berlin officials say.

“Neither side will get its way entirely,” said Ms. Greene of Manulife. Syriza will have to give way on many issues, but “Germany can't dogmatically stick to what's been put in place previously, or you'll get an outcome that nobody wants,” she said.

In context of the labour force and population Latvia is a somewhat special case, since  
  
a) It was part of USSR, hence had a planned economy  
  
b) Was heavily pumped with people from other parts of USSR ever since the occupation until the collapse of USSR [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Latvia#Ethnic_groups) (note how total population grew by 27% 1989/1959 while Latvian population increased only by 7% during the same period)  
  
So after the transition from planned economy to the market economy it is quite likely that the labor market found itself VERY far from the market equilibrium and taking into account the absolute harshness of the planned-to-market transition together with various external shocks over the years Latvia's population is just slowly adjusting to its natural state.

Nah, it goes much further than that. There's also 1920 Polish-Russian war to consider, where bolsheviks tried to destroy the just reborn Polish state. And the century-long 1815-1914 Russian occupation of the Kingdom of Poland (culminating in 1830 and 1863 uprisings). It's not hard to guess who was *the* leading force behind partitions and destruction of the Commonwealth right after it started to reform, and intervened on the side of self-sponsored rebels during the 1792 civil war?

Soviet atrocities, while one of the most recent, were just another brick in the wall. There's no other country who ever was so consistent for so long in being an existential threat to Polish state and enemy to Polish people. Even today, when they arguably *indeed* tamed down (mostly because, not counting their rusting nuclear arsenal, they are ridiculously weak when compared to any other historical instance of Russian state) they are still percieved as a serious, unpredictable existential threat and it's only a matter of time before they try to take over our country once again. That's why Poland seeks so close cooperation with US, they are powerful enough to stand against any potential Russian agression, and unlike European allies weren't proven untrustworthy when a need arised yet.",null,0,null,1422719884,null,0,1422720324,0,co6swq9,null,t3_2u7y8s,null,t1_co6swq9,null,t1_co6s66e,null,null,null,1424288676,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

For those wondering how a whole economy can crash just by easy credit being taken away. Spain had a property bubble and after the 2008 crash, european banks and investors said adiós to the property market and spain has been stuck in high unemployment ever since because the housing market was a significant factor in spain's growth in the 2000's.

And afterwards as always, due to the recession governments have less revenue. And greece in this case decided to ask the EU for a bailout because they couldn't support themselves. Not just because of reduced revenue as the credit bubble crashed but also because the greek government had to pay higher interest rates if they borrowed because the international credit market become very skeptical of lending to high risk borrowers after the 2008 crash.

Because ""austerity"" is a loaded word that lets those opposing the implementation of responsible management policies to criticise them without having to argue against their merits or the pressing need to implement them.  

By going the doublespeak route, and resort to xenophobic and nationalist arguments, they turn an absurd economic argument (i.e., arguing that a state facing bankruptcy shouldn't cut spending) into a populist one (i.e., the evil german nazi capitalist eurocrats want to rob us out of our happiness).

1. Weather winters are cold and summers can be really humid 

2. geography, this country so vast that it costs a lot money and takes a lot of time to visit relatives (2 hour flight to visit my parents in Halifax, 2.5 hour flight to visit my brother in Newfoundland, and 4 hour flight to visit my sister Vancouver) 

3. terrible telecos companies, we have some of the most expensive and least reliable mobile and internet services in the world

4. housing costs -  good luck buying a house in Toronto or Vancouver or any of our other major cities

Pros

1. good public schools and affordable university education

2. decent healthcare coverage

3. Good jobs available if you have a good education

* Nuclear weapons

* Large population size

* Global Influence

Once the economy is in shape, there is little to prevent Russia from obtaining its previous status under Soviet Union as a global superpower.

It would be a full day for the round trip: leave Rüdesheim 9.15 am or Bingen 9.30 am, arrive Koblenz 1.10 pm; then leave Koblenz 2.00 pm and arrive Bingen 8 pm or Rüdesheim 8.15 pm.

&gt; for cities like Berlin and Munich. Is it feasible to walk the city or is the rail way the better route?

You could easily walk Munich. Berlin is much more spread out, and realistically you'll need to use public transportation. A CityTourCard is €17.40 for 48 hours, €24.50 for 72 days or €31.90 for 5 days, and comes with a street map of central Berlin. Or, if you think you won't be needing public transportation very much, you can get the regular tickets -- there are single tickets (good for 2 hours, including transfers) and day tickets. You'll find an overview [here](https://shop.bvg.de/index.php/tickets). These tickets are good for bus, tram, U-Bahn (metro), S-Bahn (mass transit commuter rail) and local trains (train numbers beginning with RE or RB). **Important**: Before you use your ticket, you must validate it by inserting it in the validation machines located on all buses and trams and in all stations (usually near the ticket machines): if you don't, you may be fined €40: a lot of tourists get caught out. There are no barriers at stations, but frequent spot checks. You only need to validate a ticket once.",null,0,null,1422721146,null,0,false,0,co6tgzz,null,t3_2u98zt,null,t1_co6tgzz,null,t1_co6sig1,null,null,null,1424288398,null,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2,null

&gt;The Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (often referred to as the SANU Memorandum) was a draft document produced by a 16-member committee of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts from 1985 to 1986. Excerpts of the draft were published by Večernje novosti in September 1986.

-

&gt;The memo immediately captured the public's attention in Yugoslavia as it gave voice to controversial views on the state of the nation and argued for a fundamental reorganization of the state.[1] The main theme was decentralisation leading to the disintegration of Yugoslavia and that the Serbs were discriminated against by Yugoslavia's constitutional structure.[2] It claimed that Serbia's development was eroded by support to other parts of Yugoslavia. It was officially denounced in 1986 by the government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the government of the Socialist Republic of Serbia for inciting nationalism.[3] Some, such as Laura Silber and Allan Little, joint authors of Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation, **consider its publication in 1986 to be a key moment in the breakup of Yugoslavia[4] and a contributor to the Yugoslav wars**",null,0,null,1422721276,null,0,false,0,co6tj6v,null,t3_2uaemn,null,t1_co6tj6v,null,t1_co6p8y6,null,null,null,1424288369,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Pros:

* A country full of clean, natural environments. Half our country is forest, there's a lot of territory that has remained basically untouched.

* Starting your own business is easier than average.

* Low costs for almost everything, if your income is comparable to Western European.

* Amazing Internet connections. You'd be unlucky not to have a 100 Mbit connection.

* Amazingly good looking women.

Cons:

* Transportation sucks. We are not connected to Europe by rail, and domestic rail is very slow. Riga to Daugavpils (2nd largest city) is some 220 kilometers, but a train takes almost 4 hours. To Liepāja, the third largest city, there are hardly any trains. Ventspils is a major city by our standards, no rail connection. 

* Social conservatism, some xenophobia. Our society really doesn't like gays, and isn't used to brown or black people. Not that there's hostility, but you would be constantly reminded that you're out of the ordinary.

* Language barrier. All young people can speak English, but fewer middle aged people can and basically no older people. And even if you learn Latvian, you'll still have a language barrier with regards to Russian.

* We have one of the most rapidly shrinking populations. Riga is a large city with 700k people, but there are no other cities that reach 100k. Smaller towns have turned into ghost towns. There's probably little point in settling outside of Riga.

-to refer to the economic and political model (bare-bones welfare state, two-party politics, corporate capitalism with intervals of plutocracy)

-to refer to the global media of Hollywood, American English, and consumerism

-to refer to the US military and foreign policy

This is mostly criticism of America #3, the political and economic system.

&gt;Social conservatives being unhappy about language, slang, and customs filtering in from Hollywood

They would rather live in a fantasy world where Greece's debt was sustainable or at least be corrected by more of the same economic policies dished out so far. 

What's perhaps even more delusional is that they believe Greek democracy can cope (and keep the radical parties out) with the current system of Troika demands being imposed on the Greeks under the threat of withdrawing bailout money. That seems pretty undemocratic and a temporary solution at best. In the long term this can only lead to support for the more radical parties (both on the right and the left) which is what has happened in Greece. The mainstream parties had to band together to keep this running, leaving the opposition to the more radical parties. Did they really believe in such circumstances the latter could be kept out?

In short I think this is an example of European leaders reaping what they sowed. European leaders are facing the consequences of their response to Greece so far and aren't willing to recognise it for what it is.

* The people are often multilingual and generally pretty chill. 

* Weather is moderate. It gets hot in the summer and cold in the winter, but most of the time its cool and damp. 

* Locally-produced food is reasonably priced and of good quality (especially the alcohol). 

* Lots of historical and natural tourist attractions [in Romania, Bucharest not so much]. Car rental is cheap. Holidays in Romania are cheap. 

* Romanian download speeds are so fast you'd think it was set up with piracy in mind. 

* Things are improving constantly, on multiple levels. 

* [edit] People read fiction on the metro. You can buy books from vending machines at metro stations. There's lots of good book stores. I know its fairly inconsequential, but it's nice to live in a place where ordinary people like to read.  

Cons: 

* Dealing with anything remotely bureaucratic is a fucking nightmare. 

* Infrastructure kinda sucks. This isn't a huge problem for me, but it would be nice if the trains were faster and the public transportation system was better organized (better signage, a card that works for both metro and buses/trams, etc).

* Healthcare and education kinda suck, mostly because the professionals involved are poorly paid (IMO). I'm young and childless, so this isn't really an issue for me. I went to a private clinic once and they did an excellent job, but it wasn't cheap. 

* Living on an expat salary in Romania is great. Living on a Romanian salary in Romania is not so great.  

* I'm an atheist who doesn't believe in stuff like conspiracy theories, homeopathic medicine, that vaccines cause autism, etc. There are plenty of rational Romanians, but you have to seek them out and make an effort not to shoot your mouth off at work. Lots of otherwise reasonable people can believe the weirdest things.

**I watched the meeting. Honestly there was only one part that caused all the commotion.** 

**Varoufakis strict message that he won't deal with the tripartite committee that is been sent by the ECB/IMF and EU with a specific agenda in mind.**

**He wanted to pass a message, a message that even that firm declaration failed to pass on to the media/EU:**

&gt;We must be clear in our minds that there is a huge difference between the statutory EU institutions such as the European Commission, the European Central Bank, international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, organizations and institutions with which the Greek government has already begun consultations and whom they considers partners.

&gt;But to be clear, we distinguish them from a Commission which is mandated in the design of this project, whose scope our government has rejected, who is mandated to monitor and implement a program we have already rejected.

**I mean how more clear can this get? And still, have a look at the headlines:**

""Varoufakis rejected any extension to the country’s bailout and refused to co-operate with the troika of lenders (the ECB, EU and IMF).""

**No you stupid people. He refuses to negotiate with the commission sent by the ECB, EU and IMF. Not with the institutions / members themselves. I mean come on.** 

**Did Dijsselbloem like it? No. But is it that catastrophic? Hell, no.** 

----

&gt;the manner how Greece blocked the extending of the sanctions imposed on Russia at first - just to make a point - is worrying.

**I'll let Minister Varoufakis answer that:**


&gt;Our Foreign Minister, Nikos Kotzias, briefed us that on his first day at the job he heard in the news bulletins that the EU had approved new sanctions on Russia unanimously. The problem was that he, and the new Greek government, were never asked! So, clearly, the issue was not whether our new government agrees or not with fresh sanctions on Russia. The issue is whether our view can be taken for granted without even being told of what it is!

Well, his vision of the role Germany is to play seemed interesting. Also the plans of the coalition to deal with countries individually seemed interesting. But we will never know, because the guy got cut at every single sentence. The feature is short? Well, then limit the number of questions. Yes he rambled pointlessly a couple of times, but this feature is not informative in any way.

Well, the use of cartoons and shepherds is not innocent. It is condescending and petty.

&gt; As for public commitments if your giving an interview its inherently aimed at informing the public. If you then spend your time avoiding questions on topics you don't like you can expect to get pressured on those. Sure he doesn't owe UK citizens anything but by signing up to an interview he signed up to be grilled. And yes that is explicitly the aim of journalists. If an interviewer merely accepts the statement and moves on that's not an interview.

This interview has not been conceived to inform anybody. It is a means to extract a couple of ""yes/no"" answers and a couple of soundbites so somebody else can tell you what is going on. That is not information that is entertainment. I can't speak for other interviews on this show but, if they have been along these lines, my opinion still stands. I have seen, for example, Dimbleby moderating debates and that guy knows when to cut people and when to redirect them back to the question so they don't dodge it.

Well i can do cons all day long....

Cons:

 - No jobs. If you have one, payment is shity.
 - Terrible healthcare.
 - Terrible road, rail, public transport, internet infrastructure.
 - Only young peoeple speak english. So most of time if your Polish isn't fluent you will be unable to communicate.
 - Still big level of corruption.
 - Old part of society is rather racist.
 - Heavy poluted air especially in winter time (coal burning).
 - Very cold in winter (from 0*C to -30*C) and very hot in summer (from 28*C to 38*C). 
 - Terrible politician class (thinks only how to stole more money).
 - Authorities/agencies are not friendly to people.
 - Due to ours earnings everything is expensive for us.
 - Huge bureaucracy and still growing.
 - Very low state pension when you ends 67 years. Less than 30% of your last payment check.
 - Lots of junk agreement between employer and employee.
 - More people emigrates from this country than immigrates to.
 - Very low bith rates. We are dying out.
 - Illegal dumpings in forests.
 - People rather withdrawn and having no sense of humor. Don't smille on streets to other people or they will think that you are crazy or retarded or even worse that you laugh because of them.
 - Food isn't as good as used to be before 1989 (food in big shops/supermarkets).
 - Still very conservative Catholic society. (still cannot decide if this should be pros or cons having in mind what happend in France/Germany lately).
 - Dominant colour in clothing is black/grey/brown.
 - Complaining is national habbit so get use to it. You will hear that something is wrong on every step.

And it's very hard to find any pros.....

Pros:

 - Free and rather good education system.
 - Cousine is delicious (homemade).
 - Own sea and beautifull sandy beaches, thousends of big lakes still growing amount of forrests (about 30% of Poland territory in 2015). Majestic and quite high mountains.
 - Very cheap for outside tourists.
 - Very strong family ties/bounds.
 - Good tasty vodka.
 - High social safety (low crime rates and difficult access to weapons).

Then what's the alternative? If not the rest of europe then whos going to give you guys money to at least fund most government functions?

&gt;The cuts in spending are in all the wrong places, punishing the poor and the lower middle class.


Spending cuts tend to affect all spectrums of society. 

&gt; Rich people continue to live in luxury and ostentation. Expensive cars sales are rising. And poverty is reaching record levels.

Obviously rich people don't depend as much on government services.


&gt; Also our debt is a bigger percentage of the PIB than it was when the austerity program began.

It was rising before the bailout agreements, remember 2009?

&gt; Taxes are on the rise, social benefits hit rock bottom levels, our hospitals cannot keep up with the budget cuts anymore, our education system is in shambles. 

Obviously that whats happens during an economic crisis, the money that was there to pay for it before is gone therefore governments always cut in order to save money.


&gt;And despite all this the fraudulent rich elites get programs where their financials crimes are forgiven if they pay a 7.5% tax over what they stole and saved from tax dodging.

Thats your political system fault, besides this is populist junk. Perhaps you should be blaming spanish consumers for creating a property bubble that crashed and affected their nearby neighbor. Spain's tanking economy had more to do with portugal's economic problems then this.

&gt; It all feels like a way to scam us out of our money to help pay for the bankers and the investors loses.

""feels"" no... just no....


&gt; There is a price to be paid for pushing for social inequality. 

If you think the purpose of bailout and austerity is to ""push social inequality"" then you really are something.

I would argue it's a display of power to the other EU members. We are here, we have an opinion which you shouldn't take for granted. 

About the Dijsselbloem handshake:

 I can't tell. Honestly it's pure speculation at this point. Did he look happy? No. Was anything that was officially said enough for him to show such a display of discontent? 

Not really. Maybe if he was invested in the tripartite committee that much or if he thought that Greece was in no position to deny talks with that committee, but again, he is a politician. From my point of view, he acted unprofessionally.

The austerity measures are completely irrelevant to the causes of the Greek debt, and the only thing they do is igniting povetry and reducing Greece's GDP, which just makes the Debt to GDP ratio even worse.

While I agree with your initial point about populist rhetoric, you do the exact same thing. A state cutting its spending too much when it's going badly economically can be even more disastrous than borrowing more to sustain a vital part of the economy through the harshest times. Too many high profile, successful economists argue to ease austerity in a time when both consumers as well as the private sector stops spending. A bloated public sector is dangerous to any economy, but trying getting rid of it all while the rest of the economy is also busy collapsing can be very counterproductive.

There are obviously different schools of thought on stimulus, austerity and when to do either. Calling that point of view an absurd economic argument is just as short sighted a rhetoric, as you failed to provide any insight as to why.

It provided legitimacy for monetary policy in as much as people belived Denmark would keep the peg. Such policies can be the target of speculators as both Sweden and the UK experienced in the 90s. The road to the Euro started with the ERM (later ERM2) program that Denmark still follows. It specifies a peg to the Euro with room for small moment. We basically import Euro zone policy effects with small premiums on top. We are currently targeted by speculators that hope we will follow Switzerland and let the krone flow freely. That would raise the value of the krone hurting exports but perhaps will allow more flexible monetary policy.

Ah, I see. Yes, there are significant differences between what we had in the '80s and now. Especially regarding fruits and vegetables the advancements in world trade, logistics (tech, infrastructure), and agriculture (tech, varieties, methods, regions) have provided us with much more abundancy and variety as compared to the '80s.

There was also huge difference between the '70-80s and '50-60s. After the WWII there was lack of pretty much everything, and it took time for the world trade to recover. Hence in the '50s it was *big news* that a shipment of oranges had arrived to the harbour, and people actually gathered to see such sight with news film crews filming the event. 

But later on in the '60s it was mainly just the whole sale retailers and market place salesmen that appeared to the occasion. In those days the oranges were not packed into individual crates but just heaped into the cargo hold. So people came with their own sacks and containers to the harbor pick up as much they could to sell it as quickly as they could for the best price, a small time competition with the big but a bit slower whole sellers with their trucks.

Logistically we've came a long way from those days. You can probably imagine the difference between a giant heap of oranges vs. individually packed oranges in the terms of quality and preservation - albeit in those days the peels tended to be much thicker and could take more punishment.",null,0,null,1422724791,null,0,1422725179,0,co6v8tk,null,t3_2u8jh3,null,t1_co6v8tk,null,t1_co6rzjq,null,null,null,1424287570,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

From a political party standpoint its actually rather easy to see how it would emerge, lets say im in a party that want votes, if i agree and compromise with other parties the voters could see that we are just like them, so there is no difference in voting for us instead of them so the fear is losing votes to the other party.

Now partisan politics is a huge problem, no matter how good a suggestion is that the other party will just try to shut it down and if it was a good idea they will then try to lift it themselves when they can, making good ideas to come forward into a matter of chance more then on the validity of the idea itself, and you might have to make some rather unsavory modifications to it so you can get it through.

All in an effort to stay a strong party, the parties have forsaken why they are there in the first place, to get a government that works and tries to lead the country in the most efficient way in all areas.

Just looking at sweden, we often see good ideas being shut down by other parties just because. The Right wing nut party we have ""sverige demokraterna"" lifted a generally good idea, instead of taking in a shitload of immigrants wouldnt it be better to try to help them where they are in the first place. This idea has lots of backing from experts in the field, its much more efficient  in the first place, and does not cost very much compared to taking them in.

What Greece is hoping to get now is a modification of the debt repayment schedule (effectively a haircut) as well as softer targets for the primary surplus, which could be used to make the burden of repaying the debt less onerous for the population.

So, only foreign-law bonds were exempt from debt forgiveness. From the voxeu article you linked:

&gt;While retrofitting collective action clauses ensured that the entire stock of Greek-law bonds (€177 billion) was exchanged, some holders of foreign-law bonds decided to hold out for full payment (€6 billion out of €28 billion of foreign-law bonds).

null,false,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,null,"&gt; He has a democratic mandate

The others have a democratic mandate, too, and you can't retroactively put contracts to a vote. The validity of often painfully negotiated agreements beyond the next election in one of the 28 member states is a necessary foundation for the EU to remain viable.

&gt; and (indirectly) he represents a threat of Greece defaulting, something that the EU still does not want.

No, they certainly don't want that, but they want the precedent of publicly giving in to what they perceive as blackmail even less, especially not when Pademos is leading in Spain and M5S is strong in Italy. A ""Grexit"", as ugly as it would be, *might* still be manageable. A Spanish exit would not, and everybody knows that. Setting a precedent for people voting their debt away and high-risk games of Chicken would mean total loss of control from the perspective of the Core and markets would begin to price ""private sector involvements"" into demands for bond yields.

So far, the appearance of full repayment that voters in the North had been promised could be held up by taking the ""extend and pretend"" approach of pushing nominally full repayment into the far future at very low interest rates the last time Greece renegotiated the terms. But to voters in the North the nominal reduction of the principal under threat of a Grexit would look like Southerners robbing the bank off their savings, and there the populist threat is coming from the eurosceptic right wing.  

Unfortunately, Syriza seems to have tied its measure of success to this very demand, and they don't exactly seem to be taking a good faith approach to any negotiations. Giving in to such a tactic carries a very big risk of tearing the Eurozone apart between populist parties from the left and right while investors keep pricing the increasing risk into interests, which might well end the European Project in a very ugly divorce and economic chaos. 

They'll want to prevent this at any cost, even if that price will be Greece plus unpalatable and expensive ECB measures to prevent contagion (that I'm sure are already in a drawer somewhere).",null,0,null,1422726604,null,0,false,0,co6w5i8,null,t3_2uasea,null,t1_co6w5i8,null,t1_co6qddq,null,null,null,1424287147,null,31,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,31,null

Yeah, but it is not a dogma. Difficult times can call for bending the rules. Not saying that should be the case, but that there are no taboos in such situations.

&gt;No, they certainly don't want that, but they want the precedent of publicly giving in to what they perceive as blackmail even less, especially not when Pademos is leading in Spain and M5S is strong in Italy. A ""Grexit"", as ugly as it would be, might still be manageable. 

Yeah, I know. They can sacrifice Greece for the sake of the rest of the Union, but they definitely would prefer to have it remain. Still, it gives Yanis some leverage and he doesn't seem intent on using it as a dumb blackmail you outlined. Regardless, it will loom in the background.

I would not personally rush to argue that you are reaching some sort of natural state. I think the existence of a ""natural state"" is generally disputable. Your argument seems to be that the labor market couldn't work because there were too many people in there comparable to what the economy could handle. However the Latvian economy (like any other) isn't currently operating at capacity, but at ~70% capacity utilization, and the capacity itself is obviously not fixed. There is still room for more jobs. Why that isn't happening can be answered in two ways and I'm personally inclined to argue it's because of inadequate demand for products (and thus for labor) and not because of your oh-so-excessive wages.

Coincidentally the greeks are also following the same trajectory as the latvians, meaning that their unemployment rate fell by about 2% recently because their population also started shrinking, even though 25% of the employed persons lost their job.

The thing is that austerity is affecting population in many different ways. On one side we have the immigrants that leave their country in order to find employment elsewhere (this also means human capital is bleeding out that may hurt innovation, productivity and growth in the long run), on the other hand families go by with more difficulty which makes it less likely that they'll procreate on the margin, this also harms productivity, ages the population, renders the social security system unsustainable, and may also be self-perpetuating (or at least difficult to manage) after some point.

**Pros**

\+ Easy to find a job (also see related con)

\+ Immigration is not difficult if you have a job (I'm glaring at you, USA, UK.)

\+ Good health care

\+ Free education

\+ Plenty sick days and vacation days

\+ Plenty of people speak passable English--giving directions, etc. (also see related con)

\+ Diversity of people (also see related con)

\+ Political stability

\+ Great public transportation

\+ Great place to be single and childless

\+ Great place to be atheist

\+ Great historical towns and cities (also see related con)

\+ Beautiful castles

\+ Centrally located, easy to travel to rest of Europe

\+ (Edit) Super safe

**Cons**

\- You need to be really good at German to be good at your job.

\- You need to put your photo, age, nationality, sex, marital status and number of kids on your fucking resume. Cue discrimination in hiring.

\- Difficult to find a place to rent; also difficult to move

\- Most Germans' English is not good enough to hold a conversation involving anything more than the weather.

\- Food is shit

\- Weather is shit

\- While a diverse society, clueless on how to make immigrants feel at home/welcome.

\- Mild racism and xenophobia from small town closed mentality even in decently-sized cities.

\- Bureaucracy

\- Unfriendly people

\- Everything is closed on Sundays and holidays

\- The architecture of War-bombed cities is terrible to the point of being depressing.

That's what you get when you base your GDP in your ability to maintain a constant stream of expensive loans, spent through all sorts of government programs.

You see, the GDP reflects the amount of economic transactions within an economy.  This means that the GDP increases if the government spends loans on all sorts of economic stimulus projects, no matter how useless or wasteful they might be.

Once the loan tap runs dry and the state stops creating stimulus projects, its contribution to the GDP ceases.

Now, keep in mind that up to 2010 Greece was racking up deficits of around 13% its GDP, which the government was financing through a series of loans.

Obviously, if Greece stops being able to inflate its GDP through loans it can't keep on piling on then it will deflate.

Oh really?


&gt;Well, and I don't find it ironic at all that you now started desperately making things up about me and my position, it fits your initial level of reason.   
&gt;What lies. You said this one of your other comments:    
&gt;I also really would like an EU where I can have the option to get an EU passport. I want to get rid of national borders (not only within Europe but worldwide), so I would really prefer to be a citizen of the EU rather than ""Germany"". I want to be a European, not a German. I want to live in Europe, not in Germany.   
Here is the link to that comment:    http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2u82sp/is_this_the_kind_of_union_we_want/co67i9f

There's a national election in an EU member state roughly every other month on average. We can't possibly make it a thing that election promises somehow override international agreements that have been negotiated between 28 member states. Finding compromises is difficult enough as it is.

They didn't even talk to any of their peers before unilaterally not only putting implementations of the terms on hold, but going diametrically against them in a fait accompli on their very first day in office.

No, they most definitely would prefer to avoid such a scenario, but economic and political risk aside, on a purely personal level between the EZ's finance minsters, at this point they can't be eager to ensure that they will have to cooperate with him not just for this term, but for the following that Syriza would surely win if they are given what they demand.

You see that big old blue blob above Greece?  Currently, Greek citizens have 2 to 3 times the purchasing power that's available to the people living in those countries.

So, you see, what you'd like to perceive as being rock bottom is actually the deep blue sky for a good portion of people living in europe.

null,false,maefuckingeri,EURO,European Union,null,"&gt; What about switzerland being part of the schengen treaty but not the EU? Why don't we need a political union with switzerland to make that work?
 
Switzerland? 

Are you seriously picking Switzerland to show that an Economical Union doesn't need to be political in nature and work fine? This is so wrong on so many levels that I feel stupid for answering it. If anything it shows that approach would never scale up. It's a complete mess. 

Switzerland is  EFTA +  bilateral agreements + a bunch of other initiatives they cherry pick + a bunch of things they kind of sort of follow for the most part but sometimes but not really. And you never know what really works like the EU and what doesn't. And they have less of a say in it than everybody else. 

The only reason why it even sort of works, is because there is a EU debating and defining rules, which they then can take a look at and decide if it suits them or not. 

They are not part of the EU nor even EEA, but they have an European Insurance Card. 

Likewise it's not in any of their agreements and they had no say in it, but they adopted most of the legislation for the European Driving's licence. But of course then they go to the UK and it just kind of works, because for the long term they do need to get exchange their licence for a British one. 

And they have agreements in the area of science and they are part of Erasmus. Wait not any more! Hey at least the EU didn't take full advantage of the guillotine clause.  

In any case they can still go and study in the EU. Of course at least in the UK uni I attended, their postgrad fees were 3x those of  EU students. 

But there must be advantages for non-EU students right? Yes non-EU students have priority access to student flats. But of course for that purpose Swiss students are lumped together with EU students.  

How are roaming fees within the EU? How are roaming fees between EU-Switzerland? 

And I could go on and on and on. Like I said, it is only somewhat kind of feasible because there exists a EU, where everything can be defined, so that then Switzerland can come and try to cherry pick and/or copy what suits. 

&gt; This is a list pf DVD country codes (...) Please point me to the EU country where my dvd stops working.

While I never said you couldn't do anything without a political union (that would be stupid), and this world prove nothing, it's actually a terrible example. 

DVD's and in particular region codes are examples of corporations taking the lead and buttfucking consumers. What does the EU have to say about codes? 

http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-01-275_en.htm

&gt; *Another area where the Commission is giving direct follow-up to the concerns of individual consumers is that of Digital Video Disc pricing. We have received a significant number of complaints from private citizens on this matter. In each case, the complaint is virtually the same namely, that DVD prices are significantly higher in the EU than in the USA.*

&gt; *Whilst the prices of many products are higher in the EU than in the US, the major film production companies in agreement with the major equipment manufacturers have introduced a worldwide regional coding system for DVDs. Under this system, a DVD sold in one of the world's six regions cannot be played on a DVD player sold in another region. The thrust of the complaints that we have been receiving is that such a system allows the film production companies to charge higher DVD prices in the EU because EU consumers are artificially prevented from purchasing DVDs from overseas.*

http://variety.com/2001/voices/columns/probes-into-regional-dvd-imperils-studio-strategy-1117800545/

&gt; *Studio efforts to control the international distribution of DVDs are facing another possible setback, as antitrust regulators in Australia and the European Union look into whether the regional coding of discs violates trade laws in those territories.*

And the DVD problems didn't end here. Then you had ""DVD""'s with copy protections... that weren't really DVD's (note those don't have the logo, since they don't follow the standard), that failed to read in many laptops and cars. 

On the other hand, a good example where the EU imposed its rules in benefit of consumers however would be the  ""Common external power supply""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_external_power_supply

And these things require legislation to be adopted, and it makes perfect sense to have it defined at a EU level, after debate in the Parliament and approved by the necessary EU bodies, and then translated to national laws. And of course this is always an ongoing process. 

Here from last year, ""EU vote on phone charger e-waste"", using a Swiss website as the source to make it funnier. 

http://www.iec.ch/etech/2014/etech_0414/store-1.htm

Likewise when we talk of pushing to end roaming or harmonising copyright laws and copyright licences, all of that is market related, but requires profound reforms in legislation.

null,false,icankillpenguins,null,null,null,"Long story short, After few coups the Turkish politics were stuck in state where everything was revolving around Kemlist ideology and no party seemed to address real problems of the public. Also, large part of the population, the people with strong muslim identity, felt unrepresented and oppressed. To that, add the devastating earthquake in 1999 and the economical crisis of 2001 all the parties in the government were seen as failures and pretty much everybody wanted something new at that point. 

Then Erdogan came, he posed as a liberal and pro-western but also a devote muslim, an underdog who came within the lower class and seem to understand what people want. The USA and EU loved him, he had huge support and won the elections.

At that time Turkey was not much better than today, only the oppressors of freedom were the Kemalist elites and Erdogan really made some very important things to empower people who were oppressed since decades. 

He strictly followed the economical program that was put in place by the previous government, it was Erdogan who was to harvest the fruit from the long-term investments done by the previous government. At the same time USA started pumping money into the world economy and every single developing country started to improve drastically, of course Erdogan collected the karma points for that too.

Around 2008 Turkey was changed drastically, mostly for the better but at the same time some problems started to to get some attention. Most didn't care but it was a signal for what is coming next. Nevertheless, Erdogan had already become the hero of about %40-%50 of the Turks, the hero who empowered them in the society.

It could have been all good and dandy if those ""little"" problems were solved when persisting the trend of economical and social improvements but apparently Erdogan and his people choose to go all the way into the dark side. He already had big power and used it to design the media, judiciary and all other governmental institutions to increase his power even more and eliminate any kind of checks and balances.

For 2-3 years Turkey seemed stalled but nothing particularly bad was happening(except unlawful elimination of people who posed threat to power of Erdogan - people were being jailed on allegations of grand conspiracy and today Erdogan claims that these were actions of another conspirator(which looks true to some extent, the conspirator is his old ally) and these people were jailed based on false evidence and those who did not die in prison are free today).

Later everything quickly turned backwards, most of the improvements were destroyed, Erdogan assumed nearly absolute power and anyone who dares to question that power swiftly gets eliminated. Today Turkey is worse than pre-Erdogan era but this time Erdogan is the oppressor and the rule of law is even in worse condition than ever before. 

However the Turkish economy is still doing kind of O.K. and the people who suffered under the Kemalist rule still see Erdogan as their hero. According to social studies, most of the AKP voters are also not happy with what Erdogan has become but they don't see an alternative to him, they are not going to vote for the parties of pre-Erdogan era no matter how bad Erdogan is, they are aware of the corruption and oppression but right now if they want to vote to somebody else the only alternatives are their oppressors(who promise that they have changed and want equality for everyone) or ethnic Kurdish party(most of the Turks won't vote for the kurdish party, no matter what).

Also there is the peace process with the kurdish insurgency, which is pretty much the only good thing left from Erdogans liberal years, it's a huge thing that people don't want to fall apart and other parties don't seem much motivated or capable to complete the process.

Do I have to mention the control of the media?  It's so tightly controlled that there is no way for other political parties or any new movement to convey their message to the public. Even if other parties are capable to create policies that people may get interested in, Erdogan won't let it to become the main topic. Everything political on the news is about AKP, Erdogan controls and directs any kind of public debate and there is no way for any other political party ""to hit the front page"" of Turkish politics.",null,0,null,1422728856,null,0,false,0,co6xbkl,null,t3_2ub10a,null,t1_co6xbkl,null,t1_co6t2o0,null,null,null,1424286602,null,110,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,110,null

1) Als Einstieg ist es am Einfachsten, herauszufinden, in welcher Einheit dein Opa genau war. Dann kannst du erstmal die Geschichte dieser Einheit herausfinden und weißt schon etwas mehr.

3) Herumfragen im Familienkreis kann helfen - wenn Opa und Oma nicht mehr leben oder nichts erzählen wollen, sind die Eltern und Onkel/Tanten gute Ansprechpartner, denn im Zweifelsfall wissen die auch einiges, was Opa früher erzählt hat.

4) Nicht nur auf deinen Opa schauen, sondern auch die gesamte SS in den Blick nehmen. Wenn du die Organisation, in der dein Opa war, nicht kennst, dann hilft dir auch die Einsatzgeschichte von ihm nicht.

5) Werf einen Blick in das Buch ""[Opa war kein Nazi](http://www.hsozkult.de/publicationreview/id/rezbuecher-1544)"" von Harald Welzer, das sich wunderbar damit beschäftigt, wie NS-Geschichte in Familien tradiert wird.

They forced a haircut on private owners, which incidentally put Greece in this position. The banks got recapitalized for it (yea more debt for Greece!), Greece's social funds took it in the ass (more cuts for you serfs), and the ECB/IMF will never accept haircuts, so it's kind of a dead end.

Here's an NYT article from 2012, notice the quotes from then:
&gt;As a rule, the I.M.F. does not accept haircuts and insists that its loans are always senior to all other obligations. European politicians, meantime, already under heavy criticism from voters for their countries’ increasing financial exposure to Greece, would have a difficult time explaining why they must take write-offs on some of their Greek debt because Athens still cannot balance its books.

&gt; And many analysts do expect that Greece will eventually need to ask its public sector creditors to renegotiate its debt.

EU countries are already subject to [over 1,400](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/march/tradoc_152279.pdf) ISDS clauses.

It is fine to be against an ISDS clause in general, but it seems many ""news"" organizations are less concerned with citing actual facts, and more concerned with fearmongering.

In conpenso diventa piu' facile cercare maggioranze alternative (in questa votazione SEL ha votato col PD, ti voglio vedere sul Jobs Act), oppure una scelta indovinata di canditato puo' mettere in difficolta' gli avversari (vedi il disastro Grillino quando furono eletti Grasso e la Boldrini, anche quelle elezioni a scrutinio segreto). Cosa molto piu' difficile in una legge, dove si puo' sempre trovare qualcosa che non ti aggrada.

Insomma sono proprio due cose diverse.

Not my government. I'm north-European.

&gt; (e.g. via the ECB) without the conditions of the Troika.

I'll repeat. The ECB can't lend to states, because Germany doesn't want so. Because of that the ECB lends to *private* banks at a rate of **1%**. Those banks lent at rates **between 6% and 14%** (in case of Greece). 

Before that, when Lehman crashed, many banks, especially in the south have been bailed out, which transformed **private debt** into public debt. 

Now, if those banks make profits and these **profits stay private**, while their **debts become public**, it's not hard to see why people don't feel like having education, healthcare and wages cut for sanitizing public debt (which in reality, as a reminder, is debt of banks).

&gt; Germany is a real state with common rules (which cannot get ignored so asily like those of the EU) while so far the EU is not more than a confederation of states. The finacial risik sharing has to go hand hand in hand with the degree of integration. From this perspective starting a monetary union without a political union has been quite risky from the beginning and also lead to the euro crises.

Here comes into play nationalism. There's no European government that knows how to sell more integration, so it's easier to blame other countries, which makes nationalism and anti-European sentiment stronger, and thus integration harder. Everybody knows that's the only way, the only future, but there's no balls to sell it and/or no politician wants to take a decision in the interest of everyone at the cost of their political future and to renounce at their cosy income.

This programme was previously hosted by Jeremy Paxman, who's highly regarded in the UK and most famous [for this 1997 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwlsd8RAoqI) in which he asks a politician the same question literally a dozen times without getting a direct answer.

That interview went viral because people enjoyed seeing a politician uncomfortable and so obviously weaselling.

I've never thought such a stubborn line of questioning got us any closer to the truth and, indeed, Paxman revealed some years later that he kept repeating the question because the next segment of the show wasn't ready and he couldn't think of anything else to ask.

It looks like this interviewer has also embraced a combative style of interviewing - she's framing every question so she can damn Varoufakis if he agrees with it, and she can damn him if he replies directly in the negative. Each question she asks is loaded, so that there's no right answer if he accepts it at face value and says yes or no - she's prepped to make him look bad if he does so.",null,0,null,1422730586,null,0,1422735370,0,co6y85s,null,t3_2u988g,null,t1_co6y85s,null,t1_co6pqlc,null,null,null,1424286179,null,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7,null

Suppose for instance that the American government decides to pass a law requiring all seatbelts to be 2 inches wide, knowing that European cars have seatbelts that are 1.5 inch wide. 

There may be no difference whatsoever in the performance of said seatbelts, but if every government is allowed to pass such nonsense laws you quickly end up undoing the purpose of the free trade agreement.

The trick is to draw up rules that prohibit such behaviour without at the same time introducing ways that big companies can ignore legitimate laws, such as pollution limits, safety regulations and consumer protections. 

In practice the only way to do this properly is to set up an overreaching body which regulates the entire common market, and then it needs to b balanced with a corresponding court to oversee human rights, and then you need a democratic process to oversee it, and so essentially you will end up with some form of federal union.

Les contrats avec d'autre pays impliquent bien souvent de l'off-site

Petit exemple : tu passes un deal avec l'Inde, disons de 2B mais a condition que la production se fasse en Inde. 

Pourquoi donc ? La société monté de toute pièce pour l'occasion a une participation de l'état indien de x% (voir 100%)

Avantage : l'Inde paye 2B (1B de benef pour toi, 1B pour la production du produit) mais en récupère 0,5+ avec les taxes, bénéfice etc., développe la croissance dans son pays et récupère de la technologie de pointe.

Toi tu fais ton benef dont une grande partie n'est pas taxable en France, l'inde paye -25% sur le  tag price et tout le monde est content.

Tu ne veux pas, ok on prend le concurrent, no big deal.

La spécialisation de Total dans les hydrocarbures est de renommée mondiale, combien ils ont payé de taxe (sur le bénéfice) en france l'année passé ? **Zéro pointé**

*- désolé mais mon équipe de 500 experts comptable a trouvé les 45852 failles pour éviter de payer* Et non ce n'est pas le FN qui va régler ça. 

Aucun parti n'a de solution, il n'y en a pas malheureusement.

&gt;On propose d'annuler les conventions fiscales avec les paradis fiscaux. C'est léger comme proposition, j'en conviens.

Léger, c'est un euphémisme. le jour ou tu annonces cela, le CAC40 perd 20% et plus aucune société ne viendra s'installer en France (si il en reste) 

&gt;Le FN propose d'y mettre fin.

Le FN propose un repli, une économie en circuit fermé (c'est l'impression que cela donne, je ne suis pas économiste et encore moins spécialiste des propositions du FN dans le détail) ce qui est totalement le contraire de l'évolution en cours depuis 50 ans 

&gt;Enfin, on propose d'emprunter pendant 5 ans 15% du résultat net des 50 plus grandes capitalisations boursières pour l'affecter à un fond stratégique

Omg, c'est vraiment écrit quelque part dans le programme ? C'est encore pire que ce que je croyais 

Je suppose que la France va sortir de OMC pour espérer appliquer ce genre de mesure

In 2015, Estonia is in NATO because it chose to adopt a certain set of standards and participate in international cooperation, and Russia isn't because it chose not do to so; reasons for this are mostly internal, tightly tied with Russia's instability in 1990s (the GDP was on a downwards path until 1999) and early 2000s turn towards authoritarianism.",null,0,null,1422731471,null,0,false,0,co6yosm,null,t3_2u82sp,null,t1_co6yosm,null,t1_co6urzf,null,null,null,1424285964,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

If I were you, I'd go with graded readers, they can be entertaining and their usability is what justifies their existence. When I started refreshing my German, I read a few of them (useful vocabulary, everyday speech patterns and grammar) and then I went with Harry Potter and even though I've been working and studying, I read all of them last year.

Suppose you owe me money and I tell you ""sell your car, because you must pay me"".

Obviously, if you lose your job, you will not be able to pay the rest of the debt. So by asking you to say, pay 10% of your debt by selling the car, I am actually increasing the risk that you will never be able to pay the remaining 90%. So a more cunning plan to milk you dry is to let you have your car and ask you to pay additional interest for not forcing you to sell your car. Whatever happens I win, because either way I can put you into debt slavery, which allows me to get your car for a dime while it is still good, or let you use it and force you to give me even more. 

But as I do not trust you, I will just have you sell your car for $1 to a friend of mine, which will then lease you the car for $10 so you do not lose your job. That is probably what they want to do one way or the other.

If you actually sell the car you lose your job, because there is no public transportation to your workplace and there are no job openings available. Obviously, if you lose your job, you will not be able to pay the rest of the debt. So by asking you to say, pay 10% of your debt by selling the car, I am actually increasing the risk that you will never be able to pay the remaining 90%. So a more cunning plan to milk you dry is to let you have your car and ask you to pay additional interest for not forcing you to sell your car. Whatever happens I win, because either way I can put you into debt slavery, which allows me to get your car for a dime while it is still good, or let you use it and force you to give me even more.
&gt; But as I do not trust you, I will just have you sell your car for $1 to a friend of mine, which will then lease you the car for $10 so you do not lose your job. That is probably what they want to do one way or the other.

In 2014 there were eight legal currencies - US dollar, South African rand, Botswana pula, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Japanese yen.

Protecting your market and industry has been done since people started trading and it isn't always a bad thing to do. Most European countries follow an entirely different path compared to the U.S when it comes to welfare, healthcare, regulations and workers say on matters within the companies they work for - including Germany. I personally think the european approach is sound, just and purposeful in terms of social peace, wealth distribution and thus freedom of the individual.

When entering a common trade zone all these former hurdles will be abolished and the EU will compete with companies from overseas on an eye-to-eye level. The Problem ist, that these companies will pay - on average - less taxes, no contributions to the employees health insurance and so on and so forth, resulting in a price advantage on the market. Companies located in Europe will then face a two-way scenario: being pushed out of the market or put pressure on politicians to lower the standards to be able to compete again. And don't make a mistake, we are not talking Audi against Dodge here. We are talking about everything, absolutely everything that is being produced and not every purchase is as quality or prestige driven as buying a car.

That is exactly what people in Germany as well as in other Countries with a strong industrial sector are afraid of (look at France). Direct competition will lead to a decrease of standards for the regular working folk.

On top of that you will have these ""courts"" where companies can sue countries for interfering with their revenue. That means especially larger companies will sue the crap out of every state or city that dares to adopt new and harsher environmental standards  or anything else that slightly affects business.

And on top of all that, a decision that will have an unprdictable impact on all of us is being entirely negotiated behind closed doors - that's flat out undemocratic.

&gt;Tu ne veux pas, ok on prend le concurrent, no big deal.

À condition qu'il y en ait à la hauteur. D'où la spécialisation.

&gt;Et non ce n'est pas le FN qui va régler ça.
Aucun parti n'a de solution, il n'y en a pas malheureusement.

L'OCDE a proposé plusieurs solutions à cela : le pays de la vente est le pays de la taxe et les systèmes de taxes doivent être simplifiées. Pour les niches fiscales nationales c'est pas compliqué à régler. Pour le reste si tu es dans une zone de libre échange tu dois avoir des accords sur les taxes ou sortir de la zone en cas de vol par un pays.

&gt;Léger, c'est un euphémisme. le jour ou tu annonces cela, le CAC40 perd 20% et plus aucune société ne viendra s'installer en France

Le CAC40 c'est que dalle dans l'économie en France. En plus ces entreprises sont à capitaux étrangers mais bénéficient des plus grands contrats publics elles ne partiront pas. 95% des emplois sont dans des PME qui paient 3 fois plus d'impôts que les grandes entreprises.

&gt;Le FN propose un repli, une économie en circuit fermé (c'est l'impression que cela donne, je ne suis pas économiste et encore moins spécialiste des propositions du FN dans le détail) ce qui est totalement le contraire de l'évolution en cours depuis 50 ans

L'évolution c'est une explosion de la dette et des inégalités au profit des rentiers et des grandes entreprises. Effectivement le FN est opposé à cette évolution.

&gt;Omg, c'est vraiment écrit quelque part dans le programme ? C'est encore pire que ce que je croyais
Je suppose que la France va sortir de OMC pour espérer appliquer ce genre de mesure

Pas besoin ce n'est absolument pas contraire aux règles de l'OMC. Je parle des capitalisations boursières françaises et c'est complètement légal d'avoir un traitement différentié en fonction de la taille de l'entreprise.

&gt;Enjoy le bon de 1000% sur les taxes d'importation des produits Français dans tout les pays du monde.

Pff, les taxes contre les produits français existent déjà au cas où tu n'es pas au courant. Simplement la France ni l'UE n'imposent pas de sanctions face à ces taxes. Le FN propose donc un rééquilibrage.

&gt;Comment vous pouvez croire que vous pourrez dicter les règles à des multinationales toute puissante

Parce que les multinationales ne sont puissantes que parce qu'elles contrôlent les médias et les politiques. Dans l'économie ça change que dalle.

They should send you an automatic confirmation that they got your message and then in a few days a response that you canceled. Your card will still be valid, canceling just means they won't send you a new one after three months.

Booking is fairly straightforward on the [English site](http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query2.exe/en), just enter start city, destination city, and day. Don't forget to enter your new BahnCard 25 at the ""Travelers"" section. Then choose a connection. If you pick ""Savings fare"" you will be bound to that specific train (however you can return the ticket and get a refund minus 17,50€ fee up to the day before using the website). ""Standard fare"" is valid for all trains on that day or the following day that cost the same (you can buy the standard fare at a vending machine minutes prior to departure for the same price – they introduced a small fee for credit card payments over 50€ so I'd book standard fare tickets at the machine).

When it comes to picking an ""identification card"" choose your credit card and not the BahnCard (as you don't have a plastic BahnCard, that's the only one they'd accept). Don't be surprised that you don't need to enter the BahnCard number (but double check on the final screen that you chose a BahnCard 25).

On the train have the printed ticket, the printed BahnCard, and your credit card ready.

If the ticket says ""+City"" at start and/or destination, you can get one free ride at the urban transport before departure / after arrival.

null,false,Bartsches,null,null,null,"However by doing its people a favour Greece brought itself into a position where it would it be by itself will inevitably default. Since 1973 the Greece government has, by a large margin, spent more than its income.  As is currently see this by no means was good for its people in the long term.

Viewing the German position was at the start of the crisis - and still is - as follows. A weakened Greece is better than a defaulting one both for itself and the European Union. As no one could stop Greece if it decides by itself to default there seems to be a consensus with Greece here and Germany along the rest of the EU is willing to help. Greeces debt problem could be solved in the short term by supplying sufficient funds. However the country has a large deficit and given the last 30 years isn't likely to correct it. As such the debt problem would resurface every other year. The obvious - and only possible - solution to this is to balance income and expenditure.

There are two ways this can be done. First you can increase your income. The only way Greece can do this in a substantial way is by actually enforcing its taxes and creating new ones. The second way it can reduce its deficit is by lowering its expenditure. As a state has a number of fixed expenditures it cannot reduce w/o threatening its income for example the most promising way here is to take it from social policies, fight widespread corruption and so on.  

As is clearly visible both is hugely unpopular with the masses no politician would ever touch even one of these issues with a ten feet pole unless you force him to. Additionally Greece has gained a reputation of not fulfilling promises even going so far as to lie about its economic situation.  
This convinced Germany that Greece is unable to become stable again without supervision. As such Germany created a Group tasked with the supervision of Greeces financial policies and made an offer to Greece: Stay within the boundaries set by this group and you shall be given enough money to divert defaulting. As the goal of this group is to restore Greeces finances back to becoming sustainable in order for Greece - while weakened - to be able to stand on its own again.

Now here's the thing. Germany - and more importantly the German electorate - genuinely feels it is helping Greece and with hundreds of billions by quite a huge margin far beyond its obligations. As such what Greece is currently calling for feels for Germany like giving shelter and school to someone who has lost his job only to find the house robbed and him driving in a shiny new car.

We all know how that works. But they are the same entity. And they are doing whatever they can to dodge a few taxes - the sky is blue, what else is new? On top of that we have a legal money laundering facility in the center of the continent. Welfare, healthcare and regulations are for the most part different in different EU countries(within certain boundaries for obvious reasons). But saying that those are the same in the UK, Germany and France is... Well.. You know... But if a certain country decides to privatize it's entire healthcare, no one is going to stop that. Not the EU anyway. You make it sound like the all US companies work by Foxconn standards and Europe will become the new China. Well let's be realistic here for a moment... Do you even think this is possible even for a millisecond? Yes, larger companies will pay lower taxes, just like now so nothing new. But on the other hand there is no denial that those same companies provide a lot of positions on the job market. I remember reading a survey in Ireland about the 2.2% tax apple is paying(or something like that). The vast majority of people were unsure if that is a good or a bad thing. Raise it and force a large company employing a few thousand people to move somewhere else or carry on as it is. Personally I wouldn't be able to tell which one is good and which one is bad.

And there would be no reason whatsoever to move a manufacturing facility on the other side of the Atlantic - there is no financial benefit from it. I am in the process of starting a company and I haven't yet worked out where to start it yet. But surely the US would be my last choice given all the possibilities within the EU. The question would be how to attract highly skilled workers to ditch a certain job in favour of me. Better pay is not enough reason(never was for me).

As far as the negotiations go however, there is a release at the end of each week of negotiations - there's tons of data released constantly on europa.eu.

The requirement is to avoid posting your own opinion in the submission title. *That's* what editorializing means. The difference is that usually news agencies, newspapers, TV channels etc. already know about that rule and enforce it in their material anyway. Don't try to find loopholes etc, this isn't machine enforced; it's easy for a human to understand if a title is editorialized.

The rule is extremely specific: ""Keep your submission titles factual and opinion free."". It's furthermore clarified for /r/europe in the submission page as ""Please don't editorialize the headline if you are posting a news article."" (and I just noticed there's a typo in that). I don't think there's any doubt that the part ""owns a rather hostile reporter"" is your own opinion.

People saying ""default will solve most of Greece's problems"" I dont think realize how haphazard our system of sovereign debt is. There are syndicated loans held by conglomerates of international banks all over the world. There are bank creditors, sovereign creditors, and hedge fund creditors (sometimes troubled debt funds, commonly called ""vultures""). This is in addition to several other holders including individuals.

The system we have right now usually involves renegotiation at at least three levels, the IMF, Paris Club, and London Club (or other group of private debt restructuring group). Debt issuances typically have a clause in them that do not allow them to be subjugated to any other issuance, so they have to be treated the same as others, even those issued in other countries. Couple that with a court decision about attachment in New York, or one in Germany that held an economic meltdown is not an ""emergency"" that allows for payments to be temporarily suspended and you have a very haphazard system. 

I only say all this to show that Merkel does not have a magic wand when it comes to writing down Greece's debt unless Germany buys it from the creditors. I agree a write down would be very helpful, and likely necessary. But it is not Merkel's decision except for debt held by Germany. The IMF has consolidation programs to help heavily indebted poor countries but Greece is too high income to qualify. They typically reduce debt by 90% or more and supersede this haphazard approach to litigating in each issuing jurisdiction. I advocate expanding this type of program to everyone, but as of now it is not the case. And a default by Greece would create serious problems as well. Hopefully the creditors can come to an arrangement, but Merkel does not have the authority to call all the shots, even if it appears that way.

Imports are awesome if you have economy that also exports as much. In ideal world each country produces something exclusive so everyone can buy without conflicting each other.

Real world is that countries that invested way more in technology outpace those lesser developed countries and they create huge import problems for other nations.

In case of default and devaluation of money two things happen.

first your exports become really interesting because it is cheaper than other competitors

second imported stuff becomes much more expensive and this means people will start internally to produce goods they can't buy cheaply

Notice that both of those create jobs. Those jobs will provide tax money instead of spending it welfare for unemployed people.

Who will lose most ?
rich people because their assets in papers, bonds, cars, posesions will degrade in value
Who will benefit from it the most ?
poor people because it will create jobs they seek and since they don't have rich people bonds, investments and so one they will be least concerned

Naturally buying new iphone will be expensive.

So overall proper answer is first of all going back to home currency and default to solve problem of interests and loaners. ",null,0,null,1422738269,null,0,false,0,co72706,null,t3_2uasea,null,t1_co72706,null,t1_co71nhw,null,null,null,1424284283,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

&gt; * Then he encloses the envelope into outer envelope on which the voter's information is written.
&gt; * The envelope is delivered to the voter’s polling division of residence. After the eligibility of the voter is determined, the outer envelope is opened and the inner (anonymous) envelope is put into the ballot box.

Viele von ihnen würden so einen Kapitalverlust nicht überleben. Überlässt man sie ihrem Schicksal, gäbe es einen Run auf die Konten, und das europäische Bankensystem würde teilweise zusammenbrechen. Millionen Sparer und Geschäftsleute würden ruiniert.

Entscheiden sich die Regierungen aber, den notleidenden Finanzinstitutionen zu helfen könnte das Geld nur von den Steuerzahlern kommen, z.B. über Zwangsanleihen oder Sonderabgaben.

In jedem Fall wären die Bevölkerung die Verlierer. Sie würde sich mit politischer Unruhe revanchieren, und bei den nächsten Wahlen vermutlich die populistischen, EU-feindlichen Parteien bevorzugen.

Because Greece's initial problem was a public expenditure that was far higher than its income (we're talking about deficits systematically surpassing 10%), a problem which was compounded by fraudulent bookkeeping and covered by a string of massive loans. 

Today, thanks to the troika's intervention and in spite of its insistence, Greece's governments have only managed to talk about a primary surplus in projections for 2015.  Even if these projections were valid, the recent measurements announced by Syriza (reverting reforms, increasing public spending) mean that they are now an impossibility.   

Therefore, if Greece's entire debt magically disappeared then Greece would still be dependent on piling up debt -- yet again -- to cover the state's spending.   This would mean that at best they would repeat the very same path to short-term bankruptcy or at worse they would go bankrupt with no access to credit and out of the EU.",null,0,null,1422739614,null,0,false,0,co72w4m,null,t3_2uasea,null,t1_co72w4m,null,t1_co6yly7,null,null,null,1424283959,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

European cars are ridiculously expensive across the ocean and most Americans acknowledge that the European automotive industry is way ahead. Most Americans would take a VW over a Ford any day of the week. 

Where to begin?

1. Volkswagen no longer has a share of the famous ""German Engineering"" marketing trope. That only applies to Mercedes, BMW, and Audi (yes I know VW the holding company owns Audi). They aren't looked at as luxury cars or ""exotics"" like those other brands. They also aren't viewed as better than domestics or Japanese cars. The average American would not take a VW over a Ford, they have as good a reputation as Fiat. 

2. The German auto industry is not ""way ahead"" of American cars. Most Americans, like most people anywhere, value reliability and cost over everything else. German cars are reliable if you perform the required yearly maintenance. American, Japanese, and Korean (Kia isn't the joke it once was) cars are more reliable with much less required preventative maintenance. This isn't a knock on German cars, it's just that the philosophy behind their engineering is different. I would gladly take a German performance car over an American performance car, but if I wanted a reliable no nonsense sedan, SUV, etc, i'd buy American or Japanese. 

3. Do you know why German cars are so expensive here? Because a few decades ago Mercedes spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress to pass laws preventing people from buying cars in Germany and shipping them here. They can charge whatever they want now. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_import_vehicle#United_States

&gt; The grey market was successful enough that it ate significantly into the business of Mercedes-Benz of North America and their dealers. The corporation launched a successful million-dollar congressional lobbying effort to stop private importation of vehicles not officially intended for the U.S. market.[17] An organisation called AICA (Automotive Importers Compliance Association) was formed by importers in California, Florida, New York, Texas, and elsewhere to counter some of these actions by Mercedes lobbyists, but the Motor Vehicle Safety Compliance Act was passed in 1988, effectively ending private import of grey-market vehicles to the United States.[9] No evidence was presented that grey-import vehicles' safety performance differed significantly from that of US models, and there have been allegations of improper lobbying, but the issue has never been raised in court.

&gt; As a result of being practically banned,[9] the grey market declined from 66,900 vehicles in 1985 to 300 vehicles in 1995.[18] It is no longer possible to import a non-US vehicle into the United States as a personal import, with four exceptions, none of which permits Americans to buy recent vehicles not officially available in the United States.

If you still want to shit on an American car company, pick Chrysler, lots of people here still hate them. But Ford and GM are making much better cars now than before the bailout. It should also be noted that Chrysler was owned by Mercedes when they were making dreadful cars for the first half of this century.

The question is not who lives better, all of the EU should be in a continuous upward trajectory of betterment. All of the EU countries together. By allowing each country to move lower than the other we are just creating a Europe of two different systems. This is not right in my opinion. We all need to move upwards. Unfortunately, conservatives (in general) can't see that. It's an issue within countries (why should I pay taxes for the poor - they deserve it) and within countries (why should I pay taxes for Greece - they deserve it). Starting from this mentality, you just isolate yourself.

I don't want money flowing my way, I want money to start flowing in general but not to the banks. It has to flow to the people that can create. There is no other way to get out of it. I have said again and I'll keep saying, Greek debt was impossible to save. We should not have accepted that first package of loans. I was in the streets getting tear gassed demonstrating against accepting that loan and the austerity that came with it. Our previous gov just threw money in the black hole and fucked the citizens on top of it and threw that in the black hole as well. They didn't rationalize taxes. They didn't go after tax evasion (they covered tax evaders). They just extended corruption by allowing themselves to 'sell' public assets to their own crony friends. For 5 years they have completely destroyed the state and the people, and the EU was supporting them every step of the way. So now we need a sane solution. Recycling of profits to jump start the economies of (all of) Europe. We need a few months of support and a restructuring of the debt. There is no other way. 

If you think Greece defaulting on our debt (taking down all of the Greek banks and possibly many international banks that are exposed to toxic bonds) just because of your moralism so be it. For the Greek people this will just be the end of a chapter and we might start looking at other alternatives. Who knows maybe Putin or Turkey or China. If the EU is not going to actually try to save the country (what they were doing up to now for 5 YEARS was not saving, it was making things worse to profit the rich) then we have no reason to be in such a Union. You will see when you will need them to help...

How much do you think Greek economy can grow if they expect all the flow to go to the creditors? Or are you disillusioned to think that Greece can achieve a real 6-7%+ GDP growth so it can both satisfy the troika and have their economy re-bounce?

And even if they did miraculously achieve such a goal, do you know how many years it will take just to reach the pre-austerity GDP levels even assuming a 3.5% growth *with* the troika's target met? Around 10 years. Not to reach a GDP level able to sustain the debt without cheap loans - just to reach the pre-austerity levels of GDP.

By the definition of private enterprise being nationalised/made public, then yes, some countries went full communist. Even to this day, post-communist Russian Federation has not returned property and land to their former owners like it happened in other ex-com. countries wich are in the EU today.

If you go by this notion of communism &lt;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need&gt; , that everyone should be living a life of plenty and equality in the communist society, then it didn't work out that way; the kleptocratic authority(from local mayors to the president) in the countries stuffed their pockets with money and their mouths with exquisite delicacies whilst the working class lived a miserable life, and as that became mainstream knowledge, the regular folk tried every trick in their hand to evade productive work, steal(even items with not much value) etc. It became a system in wich everyone tried to cheat everyone else; corruption was rampant in every sector of the society. A packet of western cigarettes was the entry ticket to the hospital, coffee or chocolate to the professors, other simmilar ""gifts"" to the superiors and so on. It's still a widespread issue today aswell, at least in the Balkans it is. Perhaps the ottoman rule there played its part aswell. 

Still, through and through, a huge modernising effort happened in between ~'55-'75, at least in Romania. Nuclear &amp; hydro plants,paved roadways that crossed the entire country and linked all cities and towns, appartment blocks, industrial complexes. For a short while, people were optimistic. Literacy improved, people spent more time at school and school was made accessible to more people than before, the housing conditions of the appt. blocks spured a demographic boom in cities; although people were also forcibly relocated from country-side to cities, and a series of dumb laws passed so that pretty much every family had 4-5 kids in that period. Women were banned from abortions and condoms were outlawed. Most families had only 1 kid after the 90's, and it was a rarity to meet kids at school who had brothers and sisters.

Finland's situation was both interesting and rather precarious. We weren't an ""imperialist country"" (not the same thing as capitalist country!) and due to us being on the losing side of the last world war we had something called The Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with Soviets. It gave Soviets some (and in the 70s, A LOT*) political influence in Finland and due to also being the new stock owners of former German companies operating in Finland, capitalist power as well. On the other hand, that power meant that Finland had to be tied as part of Soviet economy (as money and heart tend to sway to the same direction). India had a similar arrangement, I understand. 

As such, much of our industry in the 70s/80s was geared toward exchanging badly made clothes to Soviet products and (most importantly!) Soviet oil close to the price of production (exchanging, as friends don't use money). We then sold the oil forward on market prices and imported Western luxuries (for those who could afford - after all, the products exported from Soviet Union were much cheaper). 

After Soviet Union fell, nobody wanted our badly made ""east trade"" goods (I don't offhand remember the exact figures, but the revolution meant that a third of our export deals vanished), which contributed to the depression of early 90s (that we had a worse banking crisis than Greece few years back didn't help -- but that's another story). 

&gt;Were the citizens of the USSR allowed to travel to Finland? 

No, the border was heavily guarded. All the Soviets in Finland were here working in the Soviet-owned companies, or were diplomats or spies (in some special cases, all three at the same time). 

&gt;I wonder if the Helsinki-Talinn ferry line was as busy as today.

I don't know if it was as busy as today, but Finnish tourism to Estonia was allowed from 1964 forward. It was rather booze-centric affair, I'm told and I've seen a political cartoon from those days joking how we're building a bridge to Estonia from empty cans of beer. Visas to Soviet Block were also available. Both my dad and uncle separately took a took a taxi from South-Baltic port city (I think from Poland) to the beaches in Yugoslavia in the early 70s. It apparently cost less than taking a taxi from one end of Helsinki to other due extremely favourable exchange rate of US dollar.  

The Helsinki-Tallinn line that you refer to started operating in 1980. Wikipedia mentions that around the same time they implemented travel restrictions for Estonians travelling to Finland, so apparently it was allowed previously. But as said, I suppose it was rather one-sided affair, but perhaps some Estonian will be happy to clarify.

null,false,microCACTUS,PIED,Piedmont,null,"I am Italian, and I'm an Atheist, as are most of my friends.  
There is (obviously?) No discrimination of sorts against atheism, and it is seen as normal.

However many factors make catholicism very strong.

I really didn't expect Atheists to be so few, this chart is a surprise for me. It made me a bit sad.

The factors that make Catholicism strong are many.

First of all Catholic Religion is a SUBJECT IN SCHOOL (public school), taught to six years old children, all the way until the end of their education at 18.  An hour per week.
It is not mandatory, however, a simple communication at the beginning of every school year is sufficient to make you avoid it.

In the end this means that children of Catholics are raised as Catholics and children of Atheists are raised without a religious education.

While the rest of the class is taught ""Religion"" either the school provides an alternative (maybe a ""lab of discussion on today's social events"" or some other light activity) or the student is free to leave the class and spend an hour in the hallway.

I have done both.

This hour of ""Religion"" (religious education) is generically meant to educate children to religion, but many teachers of said subject have different ideas on it.  
Some of them, priests or thelogians or doctors in philosophy, just spend the hour talking about morals in general, and never really touch deeply religious issues.  
Some of course teach Christian Catholic education, as originally intended, but mostly they know that all religions are to be put on the same level, and try not to influence the children too much.  
Sometimes atheists don't even bother asking to avoid the hour of Religious Education since it is so mild, generic and usually allows students to debate with the teacher and among themselves.

I have attended a year or two myself. The teacher seemed really happy to have someone who disagreed politely, and seemed curious of my ideas. They didn't convince me and obviously I didn't convince them, but there was never any tension, everything is very mild and civilized, and I think these teachers know they could get into trouble for being too strict or stark.  
This one professor I had was an atheist philosopher who taught ""Religion"", and Christian students didn't mind.
Obviously though, you can try all you want to be neutral, but your position has to be approved by a council of members of the Church, and your education and culture will mostly follow the Catholic tradition, so what these teachers say is often skewed to a Christian mentality. Not always.

This hour of ""Religious education"" is weird an pretty unhortodox for a non-religious state, but it's the price Mussolini had to pay (with a treaty) to gain the favour of the Church after a century where our WHOLE COUNTRY had been excommunicated (for attacking with cannons the Papal States and wiping them from the face of the Earth) We even had priests telling people not to vote and that the Kingdom of Italy was the work of the Devil, so at some point a pacification had to come.  

Since it is established in an international treaty (Now that we allowed the Vatican to exist as a state again) it would take a lot of work even at a constitutional level to get rid of this.

Furthermore, even more recently, in Italy there is a very deep tradition of Christian intellectuals and intelligentsia.  
The Church is very institutionalized and they frankly have very nice answers to even the harshest and most clever logical objections and criticism. At a high level the Christian doctrine is solid and unsinkable, unlike the United States for example where ""debating religion"" means debating with your town preacher and making fun of the RAW UNINTERPRETED TEXT of the Bible, which is often pretty debatable, contradictory and weird.

So many personalities of our country are Christian.  
The leading party has been for a LONG, LONG time (since the fall of fascism up to Berlusconi) a party called ""Christian Democracy"", known for its finesse and its success (other than its intrigues).  
Insulting the name of God out loud was a CRIME until recently, and it is still as big of a taboo as the ""N"" word in America.

Then there is the prominence of ""classical culture"" over scientific education. We love our Cicero, our Aristotle, our Dante Alighieri and our Machiavelli.  
And all of these, when not Christian, at some point were re-interpreted by Christians.

Dante Alighieri is our national hero, he is on the 2€ coin (Da Vinci is nothing in comparison), and we all at some point of our education (when we are educated) have to read the Divine Comedy.

To understand that alone, you need to learn some Christian culture, and I had to learn the words of some prayers for example.

TOP OF ITALIAN CULTURE = CHRISTIANITY until very recently.  

Another thing is that the Church is very present everywhere, but also very relaxed.  
""No sex until marriage"" for example is something YOU NEVER EVER HEAR, nobody complains about science (evolution is NEVER denied, nor vaccines).  
It's a very relaxed brand of Christianity, where you sin all you want and then you just tell the Priest.  
And even if you don't, it's ok, you can repent at the moment of your death.  
You don't need to do anything to be a Catholic, even if you don't go to church it's fine, and this is the model followed by younger generations.

""I kind of believe in God, if I have questions I'll ask a Priest or a theologian, I'll sin a lot but I will be forgiven (hopefully).""

And these are the younger generations, but Italy is an OLD country.   
I think we have a very high average age, we are full to the brim with elderly people.  
Atheism started spreading here from the 1960s, not earlier.  

So there.  
In summary:

 * Religion taught in public schools  
 * Ties and vicinity with the Vatican  
 * Very smart, relaxed, moderate, tolerant and intelligent Christians capable of defending their position  
 * an aging population afraid of death and bound to the ""good old values""  
 * Proud cultural ties with Christianity as an ideology/philosophy other than a religion.

This being sad I'm still surprised and saddened by the graph.

I would love to Iran but I am effectively banned. It sucks, but again, life isn't fair.

Yes, and younger too. If I had a vote in this, I'd be against google street view.

&gt; Dashcams can be good for conservation of evidence. The question is: Why not use them more often? They make everything easier.

I agree, but with the same arguments I can say that we should establish VDS again because it's easier and you can always look into sms, emails, phone calls to find *any* evidence of terrorism. But if you've seen an article (I think it was on derstandard.at), then you'll see a report which says that since we had VDS, it was not even once used for investigation of terrorism cases, but rather some small things.

Agreed, even if you breakup the two parties and implemented proportional representation, they eventually would of formed coalitions with eachother that fit ideologically.

Left Wing coalition consisting of Labor party representing union interests, Black interest party representing blacks, Hispanic dominated party representing hispanics, Progressive party representing Progressives. Green party representing environmentalists. Socialist party representing really really left wingers like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

Right Wing coalition consisting of Republican party that makes up mainstream conservatives, christian conservative party that represents social conservatism. and the tea party that represents ultra-nationalistic and very right-wing economic conservatives many of which might not even be religious. And perhaps a libertarian party in this coalition who might defect on a few issues they agree with the left like drugs but otherwise align more so with the right wing.




&gt; Also, it could be said we have a 3rd party. It's called the Tea Party. 

Not really. If you go back to the coalition argument.

In Scandinavia, the right wing coalitions are usually is made up of Mainstream conservatives, Christian democrats/conservatives, and Ultra-nationalistic conservatives.

Tea party fits the profile of these two significant right wing parties who are junior coalition partners whenever its the right wing parties combined that wins in a election.

Du siehst das so, aber tatsächlich ist es geltendes recht. Auch wenn du es für überholt und nicht zeitgemäß hälst.

&gt;Die geforderte Summe von 1000€ ist einfach brutal viel.

Knapp mehr als 900€, und der Bärenanteil geht an Anwälte. Der Fotograf erhält 200€. Es wäre deutlich billiger gewesen vorher anzufragen. Sich danach über die Höhe der Strafe aufzuregen ist lächerlich. Böhmermann als Medienschaffender weiß ganz sicher wie viel so etwas kostet.

&gt;Und der Fotograf mahnt anscheinend nicht nur prominente Medienmacher ab, sondern auch private Twitterer mit 100 Followern.

Der Fotograf macht gar nichts, das übernehmen Anwälte. Sonst könnte der Fotograf seinen Job an den Nagel hängen und Vollzeitabmahnen...

&gt;Jetzt darf jeder hier sich an die eigene Nase packen - wer hat schonmal ein ""fremdes"", also geschütztes Foto auf Facebook gepostet?

Weil es jeder macht, ist es noch lange nicht rechtens. Wenn alle von der Brücke springen, springst du auch, oder wie? Das ist ein lächerliches Pseudoargument auf Grundschuldiskussionsniveau.

&gt;Abgesehen davon ist die Lizenzierung auch noch herzlich unpraktisch - auf der Homepage des Fotografens selbst findet man keinerlei Hinweise, wo und wie und zu welchen Konditionen man das Bild lizenzieren kann.

Ich bin mir sicher du findest eine E-Mail-Adresse an die du schreiben kannst um anzufragen. Wie vom Fotografen mehrmals erwähnt gibt er Bilder auch mal für kleine Beträge raus, will jedoch immer wissen, in welchem Kontext sie verwendet werden. Ich möchte nicht, dass jeder per ""Amazon 1-click"" meine Bilder kaufen kann und die dann auf der NPD-Seite auftauchen unter dem Titel ""Deutsche Länder für Deutsches Blut!"" 
Nur weil es etwas aufwändiger ist, das Bild zu lizensieren, gibt das niemandem das Recht das Bild zu klauen. ""Entschuldigung, die Schlage an der Kasse war mir zu lang, das war mir zu unpraktisch!"" Was soll das denn bitte sein?

&gt; Ich kann den Fotografen verstehen, das Recht ist auf seiner Seite und er bekommt durch ein simples Internetmonitoring ein ordentliches Monatsgehalt rein

Wie unverschämt für seine Arbeit Geld zu verlangen. Der allergrößte Anteil an Medienschaffenden verdient richtig richtig wenig Geld, es gibt auch nur sehr wenige Fotografen die durch ihre Arbeit ""reich"" werden. Ich glaube manch einer hat falsche Vorstellungen, was Fotografen so verdienen...

null,false,gorat,ANAR,Anarchy,null,"Ι am assuming you mean measures taken that concern workers. If something different let me know. I will enumerate some that I can find now (translating from Greek :( )

* Hiring in the public sector in a ration 10:1 or 5:1 (10 people retire, we hire 1. A good measure in general reducing the party armies in the civil sector. One main problem is the reduction of income to public sector health and pension funds. The funds were completely depleted by 3 governments ago (karamanlis) when they forced the funds to give the gov a 'no interest loan' which they proceeded to gamble on 'structured bonds'. Everything lost in the US crash)

* Making it easier for companies to fire workers. Allowing mass firings of workers. (This measure was meant to be able to allow companies to fire people if they don't have enough money and without reason without paying them as much severance pay. Of course it is just used as a pressure to make people accept huge pay cuts or incredible ways of work. For example my uncle works only 3 days a week in paper - he works 6 days a week 8+ hours a day in reality. Gets paid for 3 days and is always threatened to be fired if he doesn't comply. Several examples of that).

* Allowing more part time and temporary positions (such as unpaid internships). (You can understand how this affects a population of ~50% unemployment for young people. You get hired unpaid or 'part time' and supposedly have to prove your worth to maybe get paid a little bit more in the future. This never happens.)

* Making mass negotiation illegal or less common (very variable). (This means that one union cannot negotiate for all its members as used to be the case. Each worker has to negotiate by himself which of course allowes the boss to impose whatever they want).

* All salary increases are frozen (understandable), minimum wage is reduced (understandable - we are in a deflationary mode). The reduction of wages has been in a rate larger than price deflation but at this point this is peanuts.

There are more minor points (such as reductions of salaries in the public sector, reductions of disability pensions and public sector pensions, changing of number of years you need to work to get pension etc.) But these are the main ones. Can you see they are all anti-worker measures?

For example you can write any store in the UK that operates a CCTV system that has recorded you and they have to send you the footage that includes you.

In Germany privately owned cameras that film public space, say the entrance to your shop, are illegal.

Since the relevant laws forbid the transfer of personal information into jurisdictions without equivalent protections this has been ans issue for US companies in the past.

There is the Safe Harbour process which allows US companies to process EU data if they pledge to uphold the core principles within the EU directive.
However this has always been considered a loophole of sorts since the companies self certify and there was little enforcement.

Vivi en Corrientes hace ocho anios y estoy seguro que los argentinos tambien tienen algun imagen de los alemanes.

I lived in Corrientes about eight years ago and I am sure argentineans also have an image of what they imagine germans to be.

First of all: ""Los alemanes son fríos"". The germans are cold. In a sense of being open or helpful, showing emotions and having good humour. And yes, I would say this is partially true. In Argentina I used to go to the town center every. single. day. We met up with friends in some café or restaurant, had fun, sat around drinking beer and just enjoyed the good weather ;) In Germany, you only meet up with people if you explicitly ask them to. There's not one place where you meet up.

Another thing argentineans think about Germany is that germans are very professional and just make things right. And yes, compared to Argentina (lo siento ché) this is compeltely true.

Germans think about Argentina as the most european country in latinamerica. It's definitely not on the same level as Bolivia or Brasil.

""""""""

Ι am assuming you mean measures taken that concern workers. If something different let me know. I will enumerate some that I can find now (translating from Greek :( )

* Hiring in the public sector in a ration 10:1 or 5:1 (10 people retire, we hire 1. A good measure in general reducing the party armies in the civil sector. One main problem is the reduction of income to public sector health and pension funds. The funds were completely depleted by 3 governments ago (karamanlis) when they forced the funds to give the gov a 'no interest loan' which they proceeded to gamble on 'structured bonds'. Everything lost in the US crash)

* Making it easier for companies to fire workers. Allowing mass firings of workers. (This measure was meant to be able to allow companies to fire people if they don't have enough money and without reason without paying them as much severance pay. Of course it is just used as a pressure to make people accept huge pay cuts or incredible ways of work. For example my uncle works only 3 days a week in paper - he works 6 days a week 8+ hours a day in reality. Gets paid for 3 days and is always threatened to be fired if he doesn't comply. Several examples of that).

* Allowing more part time and temporary positions (such as unpaid internships). (You can understand how this affects a population of ~50% unemployment for young people. You get hired unpaid or 'part time' and supposedly have to prove your worth to maybe get paid a little bit more in the future. This never happens.)

* Making mass negotiation illegal or less common (very variable). (This means that one union cannot negotiate for all its members as used to be the case. Each worker has to negotiate by himself which of course allowes the boss to impose whatever they want).

* All salary increases are frozen (understandable), minimum wage is reduced (understandable - we are in a deflationary mode). The reduction of wages has been in a rate larger than price deflation but at this point this is peanuts.

There are more minor points (such as reductions of salaries in the public sector, reductions of disability pensions and public sector pensions, changing of number of years you need to work to get pension etc.) But these are the main ones. Can you see they are all anti-worker measures? Coupled with deflation of the economy they have completely destroyed the workers.",null,0,null,1422746207,null,0,1422746388,0,co765ee,null,t3_2u7kqp,null,t1_co765ee,null,t1_co75to6,null,null,null,1424282418,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Judges are well-paid &amp; well-respected, not the type the system can be blamed on for forcing their hand out of desperation.  

Although to bring it back to topic &amp; common ground, you're absolutely right it's a danger in regards to judges potentially getting kick-backs for destinations &amp; sentence-lengths.

The real problem is the law enforcement establishment that benefits greatly off of imprisoning so many people.

- [Paedophile gangs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal#See_also) operating in Rochdale, Rotherham, Oxford, Derby, Bristol and Telford, which carried out activities including ""abduction, rape, torture and sex trafficking of children"" - with at least **1400 victims** in Rotherham alone.

1) Rockstar sleeping with 15yr groupie after a concert in 1975
2) Homosexual man having sex with reasonably aged partner when the age of gay consent was artificially high.
3) Rapid disabled children and necrophelia.

Ties run deep, whether talking corporate, political, military or intelligence. Military interventions, coups &amp; importing monopolies have all come to define the relationship on top of the large amounts of development aid and the French-backed currency union linked above. 

To say if it is for better or for worse though is not something I'll get into. Africa is as complicated &amp; chaotic as the Middle East; nor is it like France is the only country that has moved to advance it's own national interests on the global stage. But, what can't be denied is that it benefits France immensely, and by extension, benefits Europe.

&gt; Si può non essere d'accordo con un nome, ma bisogna farlo a viso aperto

Renzi lo ha ripetuto mille volte, e non vuol dire nulla. Se il partito decide democraticamente un nome, tu puoi dire che non sei d'accordo, ma se al voto fai quel cazzo che vuoi per destabilizzare la dirigenza, sei un figlio di puttana. Punto. Che tu lo dica o meno è indifferente. Lui lo ha trasformato in atto mediatico perchè gli serviva come segno di forza. Se gli faceva comodo farlo in segreto, faceva quello, mi sa che non hai proprio capito la personalità infame di renzi, la cosa paradossale è che stiamo commentando un post che elogia il suo cinico doppiogiochismo (paragonato addirittura a tywin). Ora è ridicolo che renzi invochi la compattezza del partito perchè adesso c'è lui. Ovviamente non è che vai a rubare nella casa del ladro. Nel caso non fosse chiaro, se renzi non supportava mattarella che veniva dalla minoranza pd, loro gli rifilavano la stessa medicina con tanto di ""lo abbiamo detto pubblicamente"" e succedeva la stessa cosa di due anni fa, e renzi finiva come bersani. Adesso si fa passare come scaltra mossa tattica di renzi una operazione su cui lui non aveva scelta (se spaccava il pd per andare dietro a berlusconi, a casa a firenze era meglio non ci tornasse più). 

Interessante come Civati diventi rilevante quando c'è da prendere delle colpe, che poi Marino faceva orrore anche a me. Anche se Civati aveva torto era comunque ininfluente quindi non ha la stessa responsabilità. Da ricordare tra l'altro che sono andati contro Marini perchè non volevano gli accordi con berlusconi... Civati è ancora di questa idea, quindi coerente almeno,Renzi ha fatto il Nazzareno, per dire... Per questo è chiaro che Mattarella non è la vittoria di Renzi, ma proprio di chi la pensa come Civati, visto che il nazzareno è archiviato (forza italia, dopo una sceneggiata da copione, seguirà comunque il PD perchè non ha alternative, adesso con il nuovo presidente si può rivotare e berlusconi è messo peggio di prima, non penso siano così masochisti). 

La mia affermazione non era diversa, era uguale, ho solo aggiunto la motivazione per non doverla ripetere come ho fatto con te, vista l'amnesia generale sui fatti che portarono alla rielezione di napolitano. Ripeto ancora, i renziani hanno fatto fallire l'elezione del presidente, sono diventati i primi colpevoli quando hanno dato il via all'anarchia nel PD dopo aver rifiutato il candidato scelto dal partito, cosa assolutamente antidemocratica. Se dai una mazzata al capitano, quando la nave va sugli scogli, non puoi incolpare i marinai che stanno tirando le vele da tutte le parti.

Dei 101 non ho mai dato una versione, è abbastanza inutile. Però, visto il comportamento viscido e doppiogiochista di renzi, che alcuni dei suoi abbiano fatto parte dei 101 è una cosa del tutto plausibile.

Unfortunately the compassion he speaks of so highly is often forgotten in these times, when people rally to oppose lax immigration and politicians deliberately allow weapons to be secretly sold to people that use them to oppress others, for nothing more than financial gain and a strong economy... to name just a few examples.

However, I have to criticize one thing about the speech. Every time when he talks about religion, I can't help but roll my eyes. It is sad that it was necessary to include religion as a motivation for morale in the speech.

Another example for when he should have refrained from citing religious texts: He appears to be misinformed about the number 40. The number 40, especially in the old testament or in ancient history does not necessarily mean 40. For example Ali Baba and the 40 thieves had more than 40 warriors. 40, in ancient history of the orient and occident, was often a number used to describe the concept of ""a lot"" for the lack of a better word or number. The number is reoccurring throughout the abramahic religions.

2.  The vocabulary is pretty simple, too, though it is a little bit dated.

3.  Best of all, it has German on the left page and English on the right, so you save tons of time looking up unfamiliar words.  Just a quick glance across!

In an age of free movement and globalisation, it would make it safer for people who are travelling between countries if a standard side of the road had been decided long ago; whichever side that is is beside the point, but the UK is vastly outnumbered on this one.  

Also, if you've ever driven a standard left hand drive car, particularly an older one, you'll find they did used to handle better, because they were never designed to be Right Hand Drive, so the British effectively got an afterthought conversion with French, German, Italian and American models.  

Then there is the fact that if everybody drove the same specification of car, the prices of cars would go down a bit, as there would be no need to have a British/Irish-specific set of specifications that had to be developed, built, machined, etc, at a cost that those who don't need right-hand-drive cars rightfully shouldn't have to pay for.  


There are some shops, one in particular not far from me (which is run by a rather loudmouthed UKIP donator) that actively refuse to serve you in metric units.  

I have no clue what a ""pound"" is, nor could I visualise an ""inch"", a fraction of an inch is even harder to visualise to me.   

This doesn't matter to the typical ""proudly British"" traditionalist who refuses to have anything available in metric units; I suspect because metric units are French.  

They should be required to show metric units, alongside imperial, for those of us ( quite a large number nowadays I suspect) who have no clue how to calculate imperial units, and don't visualise them so well.",null,0,null,1422748791,null,0,1422748978,0,co77gu1,null,t3_2ub560,null,t1_co77gu1,null,t1_co7728a,null,null,null,1424281772,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null
