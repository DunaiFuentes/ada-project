What's the Greek problem? 

For starters, all these 'reforms' will take money out of the market, and out of people's pockets; the most vulnerable people. Most of the profits end up repatriated to foreign countries, and benefits fail to help Greece grow. 

Loss of sovereignty and national humiliation likely to cause hate, similar to nation who was conquered in war, except without war. 

Labour market 'reforms' mean workers lose protection, have their wages slashed, lose collective bargaining, are totally subject to capricious whim of employers who can exploit to heart's content because 26.5% unemployment

More famine, more poverty, more suicide. Pensioners starving to death. More homelessness. Need for humanitarian aid in first world country.

Debt level goes up to &gt; 200% / GDP, GDP contracts. Greater deficit, spending break kicks in, rinse, repeat.

Nobody buys anything because nobody has money, businesses close, all debt and tax targets missed. People pay even less taxes than before, state does not have jails to hold them all. 

Everybody under 40 emigrates to escape.

Violence, social unrest, extremism, Nazism, hard left, hard right parties mobilise to overthrow government, though they may not be able to do it. Political instability.

Das geht nur, wenn man sich mit seinen Schuldnern, seien sie privat, institutionell oder öffentlich, darauf einigen kann. Verpflichtet so einen Deal anzunehmen, sind die nicht, denn er bedeutet für sie einen Geldverlust, verglichen mit dem ursprünglich vereinbarten Zahlungsbedingungen.

*One LGBT support group cited by Human Rights Watch documented more than 300 homophobic attacks last year*


&gt;474 cases **including insults** in a whole year in a whole city. You can see at least 10% of that in the video alone.


*Lets quote*

*The MANEO Report shows that main offences in anti-gay acts of violence are insults (26%; 2011: 30%), actual and aggravated bodily harm (25%; 2011: 21%), and assaults and threats (26%; 2011: 17%)*



Obviously insult is only 26% while the rest are physical arms.

I stil dont know where you get that 10% number assuming you understand Russian or read the translation.

First off, most people that post here will probably be those that inform themselves a bit more than most average people. [I also always have the feeling that germanys population is a bit behind in informing themselves from various perspectives via the new means that is the internet, but that is probably just me and most likeyl just the same case as in other countrys.]

Second: Following this, i have got the semi-knowledge (or crossly said, feeling) that everything that is good right now in Germany isn't actually Merkels work, but the work of those before her. The effects just tok hold right when she came up.

Third. It is not as great as everyone says. At least from my perspective, the last ten years or so was fraught with climbing prices and not much rais in income and with the past endorsement of time share works a huge amounts of income dumping (i have actually worked in that area for a while and it#s utter shit and in my oppinion criminal what they do, especially to people that can't really object. I could tell storys!). Our eductaion system causes systemic depression in our children and dearly needs a work over. 
The demands from outside towards the social sectors (like kindergarten teachers for example :-P) are rising constantly, wich is actually okay, always good to have beter quality in thet. But at the same times there are massive cuts in material to work with and overall work hours to do all this shit with. As a result people that want top work in this sector with it's so vulnerable ""work material"" (children, the sick etc.) are constantly stressed overworked and sick.

Fourth. And i never thought i would say anything the like: Merkel acted totally fucking incompetent when it came to the Surveillance Scandals. Talk about the Greece feeling humiliated.
And all Merklel did was essentially working FOR the perpetrators and making many Germans feel as if she delivered us to the US without the US NEEDING to ask for it. 
Germans, or at least i, wished for a FAR greater reaction from her towards the US instead of the duckmäuser and bückling behaviour she showed.

It is frustrating the our highes elected official appears as a weakling without a spine in her that left her people defenseless and alone in this case. She has no oppinion and position, a colorless arseface.
And the worst is that most Germans reward her for that, because if you have no oppinion to voice or stand for then you can't collide with anyone.

But Greece isn't a normal economy.

The reason the EU insisted on a VAT increase is because it's the ONLY tax the Greek government can collect reliably. All other taxes can't be collected reliably. That's why taxing the rich isn't effective. They avoid taxes, bribe officials and dodge taxes, just like the rest of the population.

Greek inability to collect taxes is what caused the crisis in the first place.

About the Pension scheme. Greece dedicates 10% of it's national budget to paying pensions schemes for government employees. In comparison, Germany pays 3% which is already fairly high. Anything above 5% is considering unsustainable.

That simply doesn't work.

The problem with statistics in Greece are that they are completely unreliable. That's why their statistic's office is given complete autonomy with the reforms.

No matter what age Greeks retire or how many hours they work, it's completely meaningless because their productivity is so low. It's not an issue with the workers per say, but with the structural organization and the inability to get anything done.

Greeks aren't lazier than anyone else, it's just the way their institutions and bureaucracy works is SOOOO much less effective than anywhere else in Europe.

Even Ex-Communist countries, notorious for crime and corruption, have managed to build more effective and sustainable economies.

And when you are being outperformed by the likes of Estonia, Lithuania and Slovakia you have to quit whining about ""dignity"" and ""pride"" and get your act together.

Bingo. Hier wäre kluge Europapolitik gefragt... rausgekommen ist eine Inszenierung der Macht Deutschlands die Europa kaputt machen wird. Es ist mehr als durchgesickert, dass Deutschland die Knöpfe der Troika dreht. 

&gt; Ob Griechenland dazu in der Lage gewesen wäre? Seine Anleihen hatten offiziell Junk Status.
&gt; Formal zählen Moratoria und Umstrukturierungen von Schulden zu Credit Events, die z.B. Credit Default Swaps auslösen.

Ich meine irgendwo gelesen zu haben, dass Griechenland so im Arsch ist grad, dass die 10%GDP-Wachstum alleine durch lockern der Schlinge hätten... 

Zudem ist der Konsum gerade völlig am erliegen, da würde sich mit besserer Perspektive sicher auch etwas ändern...  

Die Schulden sind ja weg vom Finanzmarkt und die Troika bzw. EU hat mehr als Genug Zeit und Geld eine saubere langfristige Lösung anzubieten. 

&gt; Griechenland brauchte auch Geld für seine jährlichen Staatsausgaben:

Die sind aber erst so richtig explodiert als die Wirtschaft um 1/3 eingebrochen ist... dann sind alle Pleite und die Ausgaben steigen und die Einnahmen sinken rapide...  so eine Änderung würde selbst Deutschland umhauen. 

&gt; Das demokratische Mandat von SYRIZA hat nie jemand bezweifelt, Aber seit wann kann ein Schuldner im Rückstand seinen Gläubigern die Bedingungen diktieren, unter denen er gewillt ist, ihr Geld anzunehmen?

Hier geht es nicht um ein Haus. Und natürlich kann ein Schuldner verhandeln oder in die Privatinsolvenz gehen... das hat aber nichts mit einem Staat zu tun.. das scheint aber keiner zu kapieren. 

Die Idee von Varoufakis und co. war eben um etwas Luft zu betteln damit die Wirtschaft anläuft und mit den Reformen dann die Schulden zu tilgen bzw. einen Schuldenschnitt aushandeln damit das Land nicht noch weiter untergeht. Ich sehe immer noch nicht wo das nicht legitim war. Vielleicht im nachhinein naiv angesichts der zu Tage getretenden Machtverhältnisse... 

&gt; Immerhin haben sie schon über 320 Milliarden Euro in Griechenland investiert.

Toller Satz. Klingt so als ob die alle im Benz rumfahren würden in Griechenland... du weisst doch auch das das Geld nur zu einem kleinen Bruchteil beim Staat gelandet ist und es nur so viel ist, weil die tollen Pläne von Wachstum nicht aufgegangen sind... wie es jeder nichtneoklassische VWLer 2010 schon voraussgesagt hat. 

&gt; Bei den nötigen Reformen von Verwaltung, Steuerwesen und Wirtschaft ist in den letzten 5 Jahren zu wenig passiert. In der Politik herrscht nach wie vor Vetternwirtschaft, siehe z.B. die Stelle für Tsipras' Cousin im Außenministerium.

Zu wenig? Die neue Regierung ist 5 Monate im Amt... vorher gab es wohl die krassesten kürzungen die je ein Land erlebt hat... erzähl das mal deiner Oma, die 40% weniger Rente hat. 

Das es auch dort Vetternwirtschaft gibt ist keine Frage... die Frage ist nur inwiefern die den Staat weiter plündern wie die Regierungen vor ihnen und dafür gibt es bislang wenig anzeichen. 

Ich denke es ist ein politisches Versagen von Europa, dass das so passiert ist.

Bürgerdialog klingt nach Herrschaftsdialog. Frei nach dem Motto, die Königen fragt mal nach, wie es dem Volk so geht und was man noch verbessern kann. Als würde man nur hier und da ein Paar kleine Schräubchen drehen müssen und dann wäre die Welt perfekt. Das ist reine Postdemokratie. Politik ist das demokratische Ringen um politische Visionen und ideologischen Ausrichtungen. Es geht auch nicht um einen Dialog mit dem Volk. Die Politiker sollen uns repräsentieren und den Dialog stellvertretend für uns untereinander im Parlament austragen. Dafür haben wir sie ja gewählt. 

Zur Gleichstellung der Ehe. Einfach zu sagen, man ist anderer Meinung, ist ja schön, aber eine unbegründete Meinung ist für den Wähler wertlos. Wir wollen wissen warum. Wegen Gott? Weil sie die Heteros doch besser findet? Oder wie? Am Ende hat sie nämlich keine Argumente. Das ist reine Machpolitik für die konservativen Wähler. Wollen wir das?

Please stop saying this. This actually infuriates me because of how bullshit it is. Not that it isn't *technically* right, but it's totally irrelevant! 

We helped Greece pay off loans that cost them 15-20% interest, so that now they only pay 3% interest. That is very much a favour *to Greece!*

But yes, if you help someone pay off their debt, or take over the debt (same thing, really), then the original money lender gets their money back. Duh. That does not mean that you've somehow simply left Greece in the cold and just helped the banks!

If you give a poor man a few dollars, and he goes and buys some cheap canned foods from Walmart with that money, does that make it ok to angrily say: ""All that money has gone straight into the pockets of a large corporation instead of to that man!""?

No, you've helped that man out, Walmart is just doing business like it normally does.

&gt; deputaţii pot fi urmăriţi şi trimişi în judecată penală pentru fapte care nu au legătură cu voturile sau cu opiniile politice exprimate în exercitarea mandatului, dar nu pot fi percheziţionaţi, reţinuţi sau arestaţi fără încuviinţarea Camerei Deputaţilor, după ascultarea lor.

The law also says:

&gt;&gt;Art. 194. - (1) În caz de infracţiune flagrantă, deputaţii pot fi reţinuţi şi supuşi percheziţiei. Situaţia va fi adusă de îndată la cunoştinţă ministrului justiţiei. Ministrul justiţiei îl va informa neîntârziat pe preşedintele Camerei Deputaţilor asupra reţinerii şi a percheziţiei. În cazul în care Camera constată că nu există temei pentru reţinere, va dispune imediat revocarea acestei măsuri.

Which  translates as:

&gt;&gt;In case of [a] flagrant crime(s), **deputies can be detained and searched.** The situation will be brought up promptly/immediately to the Minister of Justice. The Minister of Justice shall promptly inform the President of the Chamber of Deputies about the detention and search. If the Chamber finds no grounds for detention, it shall order the repeal of this measure/procedure.

Asadar, unde scrie ca are imunitate de a fi anchetat si condamnat? Ne uitam iarasi, daca vrei, io nu gasesc sa fie cineva cu imunitate. Singura persoana care are imunitate e presedintele.

&gt;So no matter what evidence the prosecutors bring, the PM cannot be searched, especially related to his actions while being a member of the chamber of deputies.

You're avoiding it: there isn't any immunity to anybody but the president. He and the others are protected to potential abusive [preventive detention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_detention)/arrest and ilegal searches without probe/evidence. 

&gt;/u/Spermezan, I see the pro-socialist-party bias in your comments throughout reddit and I have nothing against that, but please try to come up with evidence to support your claims next time and especially when you contradict someone else.

/u/dkrandu, for your own information: I'm not a socialist nor have any support or sympathy for left-wing ideologies. I am a libertarian minarchist, believe it or not. ***However***... I have no tolerance for hypocrisy, abusiveness, false accusations, media/populist bias and word twisting semantics; all filled with character assassinations just because somebody is from a different party or has different way of thinking. Just like you did, prejudicing with ""the pro-socialist-party bias in your comments"", labelling with character assassination with me. I see a lot of these done by shills paid by the secret service.

**Dahingehend meine erste Frage: Es gab ja schon im April rein aus dem Netz durch ""Mesh Collective"" (?) Bemühungen irgendwie an sie heranzutreten. Was mich natürlich und viele andere auch interessiert hat ist: Warum jetzt und warum Youtube?**

*Ja..jetzt passt einfach gut weil wir unseren Dialog mit den Menschen in Deutschland begonnen haben. ""Gut Leben in Deutschland"" und da möchten wir dass alle Altersgruppen sich daran auch beteiligen und da ist bei diesem Format auch ne gute Chance, dass auch die jüngeren von diesem Dialog was mitkriegen. Und ich würde mich auch freuen wenn möglichst viele da mitmachen. Da gibts unsere Website www.gutleben.de* [Richtige Adresse https://www.gut-leben-in-deutschland.de/DE/Home/home_node] *und da kann man sich melden mit allen Fragen die heute vielleicht nicht dran kommen.*

*Aber jetzt wolln wir erstmal gucken was wir heute unterbringen.*

**Ja. Sehr cool.             
Wenn wir übers Thema 'Gut leben in Deutschland' reden kommen wir nicht umhin, dass ich Sie natürlich auch frage: Was heißt 'Gut leben in Deutschland' eigentlich für Sie?**

*Na Gut leben heißt erst einmal: Was ist mir wichtig im Leben?       
Und da haben ja alle Menschen unterschiedliche Vorstellungen. Ich zum Beispiel arbeite gerne, was mir auch Spaß macht, was mich auch sagen wir mal beschäftigt; auch nach 8 Stunden noch. Andere haben vielleicht andere Prioritäten.*           

*Und 'Gut leben' heißt natürlich auch immer, dass ich nicht alles machen kann was mir jetzt gefällt, sondern dass ich auch daran denken muss dass außer mir noch fast 80 Millionen oder etwas mehr als 80 Millionen auch ihre Vorstellungen haben. Also das heißt auch 'Wie können wir füreinander einstehen in einer Gesellschaft. Wie können wir füreinander sorgen. Wie können die Generationen, die Jungen mit den Älteren, leben. Wie können die Migranten mit denen die schon immer hier leben zurecht kommen.'*          

*Und wir erhoffen uns einfach viele Anregungen, weil wir nicht sicher sind ob unsere Gesetze die wir machen immer genau das treffen was den Menschen auch wichtig ist.*

**Also insofern ist ja dieser Bürgerdialog - auch online - sie haben ja gerade schon von der Website gesprochen tatsächlich wichtig. Weil bisher, wie wurde denn bisher dieser Lebensstandard bzw. die Glücklichkeit der Menschen im Land ermittelt. Doch eigentlich vorwiegend am Wirtschaftswachstums des Landes?**

*Am Bruttoinlandsprodukt. Also was wird produziert und wie viel ist das pro Kopf? Daraus kriegt man das Wachstum, dann weiß man aber noch nicht wie sich das verteilt, der Wohlstand. Und man weiß immer noch nicht: Wofür möchten die Menschen ihr Geld ausgeben? Wie möchten sie ihre Zeit verbringen? Wir haben ja folgendes: Früher zum Anfang der BRD, da war es erstmal wichtig dass die Wirtschaft wächst, dass man selber mehr verdient. Heute ist der Faktor Zeit für viele Familien, für junge Leute auch ganz wichtig geworden.*           

*Also Zeit und natürlich auch auskömmlicher Verdienst sind auch zwei Dinge die auch miteinander im Konflikt stehen. Und das können wir dann gut diskutieren mit den Leuten.*

**Absolut. Gerade in Zeiten von beispielsweise Multijob-Eltern und auch in Zeiten von Zeitarbeitsagenturen muss ich nämlich für meinen Teil persönlich sagen, dass ich es immer relativ absurd fand, das eben nur am Wirtschaftswachstum oder am BIP festzumachen. Weshalb ich das mit dem Bürgerdialog schonmal begrüße. Und wenn wir bei dem Thema 'Gut leben' sind, kommen wir natürlich zu nem Thema das -**

*Darf ich jetzt dazu nochmal kurz was sagen? Man darfs nicht am Wirtschaftswachstum nur festmachen, man darfs auch nicht nur an der Frage festmachen: ""Was wollen die Menschen jetzt?"" Sondern man muss natürlich auch fragen, wie viel Schaden füge ich anderen zu? Also lebe ich nachhaltig, lebe ich im Blick auf die Umwelt ordentlich? Bereichere ich mich indem ich vielleicht zu Standards Rohstoffe nach Deutschland einführe, die woanders mit Kinderarbeit oder mit unsozialer Arbeit gewonnen werden. Also das hat verschiedene Dimensionen und eine ist eben dieser Zufriedenheitsfaktor, den man nicht außer Acht lassen sollte.*

**Also es ist quasi garnicht nur 'Gut leben in Deutschland', sonder es steht tatsächlich unter dem großem Überbegriff 'Gut leben'. Und dazu gehört auch und da können sie sich sicher auch denken, dass das eine der Fragen ist mit denen ich überhäuft wurde. Dass für viele Menschen auch in Deutschland zum Thema 'Gut leben' eben auch eine feste Bindung/Partnerschaft und eben auch die gleichgeschlechtliche Ehe gehört. Was mich da jetzt natürlich interessiert ist: Wie fühlen Sie sich persönlich wenn sie dann konfrontiert werden mit beispielsweise so nem offenem Brief der CDU die die gleichgeschlechtliche Ehe vehement ablehnt.**

*Ja also ich bin erstmal jemand der sehr stark dafür ist, dass wir alle Diskriminierung abbauen. Also wir haben ja viel geschafft. Wenn ich denke, vor 25 Jahren da haben viele noch nichtmal sich getraut zu sagen wenn sie schwul oder lesbisch sind. Da sind wir Gott sei Dank drüber hinweg. Man kann ne Partnerschaft, ne eingetragene Partnerschaft eingehen. Für mich persönlich ist Ehe das Zusammenleben von Mann und Frau. Das ist meine Vorstellung, aber ich bin für eingetragene Partnerschaften, ich bin dafür dass wir im Steuerrecht keine Diskriminierung haben. Und wo immer wir noch Diskriminierung finden, werden wir sie auch weiter abbauen.*

**Aber ist es dann nicht im Prinzip so nen bisschen Wortklauberei? Wenn man tatsächlich sich nur davor scheut, dass homosexuelle Menschen etwas wollen, das nur gleich ist, aber nicht gleich benannt wird? Weil das ist für mich immer noch ein Unterschied und das ist nicht das Gleiche. Und sie wollen einfach das Gleiche. Alles andere ist für mich nen Ausschlussverfahren von etwas.**

*Ich glaube, dass man das auch akzeptieren muss, dass es dazu verschiedene Meinungen gibt. Ich sage meine und für mich ist die Ehe das Zusammenleben von Mann und Frau. Und ich möchte keine Diskriminierung und ne mögliche Gleichstellung. Und ich mache dann an einer Stelle eben einen Unterschied, da haben sie Recht. Darüber gibts halt in der Gesellschaft unterschiedliche Meinungen, selbst bei mir in der Partei, der CDU gibts unterschiedliche Meinungen. In der Regierung gibts dazu unterschiedliche Meinungen, das muss man ne Weile halt dann einfach auch aushalten.*

**Absolut. Also quasi man könnte schon sagen: Diskriminierung? Nein. Aber ein Unterschied soll nach wie vor gemacht werden.**

*Keine Diskriminierung, Ehe als Zusammenleben von Mann und Frau.*

**Okay. Die Meinungen gehen ja weit auseinander und gerade im Netz wo ich mich ja doch des häufigeren ja tummele, fällt nen Trend auf der mir persönlich unendlich sauer aufstößt. Das ist der Trend des offenen Hasses gegenüber Anderen, gegenüber ""Andersartigen"" sag ich jetzt mal bewusst in Anführungsstrichen. Und es ist auch ein bisschen der mediale Umgang damit. Haben Sie aktuell ein bisschen Angst vor nem schleichendem, ner neuen Art von Nationalismus der sich in Deutschland vielleicht breit macht?        
Bei so vielen Ablehnungen in Zeiten von Pegida, Griechenland-Feindlichkeit und auch Homophobie die auch im Netz immer noch ganz groß ist.**

*Also lassen wir uns erstmal nur vom Nationalismus weg. Ich hab schon Angst, dass..oder Angst ist falsch.. Sorge, dass gerade das Internet ein bisschen dazu verleiten so richtig mal alles rauszulassen was in mir an negativen Gefühlen ist. Und ich finde schon, wenn es um die Würde anderer Menschen geht dann muss man sich fünfmal überlegen bevor man jemanden bezichtigt, beschuldigt nur weil er anders ist. Und auch dann ist es nicht gestattet, weil wir haben ein Grundgesetz. Und darauf sind wir unglaublich stolz, das beginnt damit, dass die Würde jedes einzelnen Menschen unantastbar ist. Und daraus leitet sich alles in unserer Gesellschaft ab. Und ob jemand Jude ist, ob jemand Araber ist, ob jemand Muslim ist oder Christ ist oder gar nichts glaubt. Da muss ganz klar sein, ob Internet oder reales Außenleben, direkter Dialog, da muss man den Anfängen währen. Wenn man da einmal anfängt 'Och ist ja nur im Internet, ich sags ja nur.' Vielleicht noch unterm anonymen Kennzeichen [Anmerkung: Kennzeichen..ayy lmao], dann ist das nicht in Ordnung. Und ich finde da bin ich sehr froh, wenn nicht nur Ihnen, sondern möglichst vielen gegen den Strich geht. Und dann kommt noch dieser Punkt, dass man sagt 'Wir Deutschen sind so und die sind so', das ist immer falsch weil jeder der mal irgendwo in nem anderm Land war weiß dass weder die Deutschen alle Gleich sind und schon gar nicht Menschen in andern Ländern. Also jeder Mensch ist einzeln ein Mensch und mit seinen Vorstellungen, mit seinen Fähigkeiten, mit seinen Fertigkeiten und mit seinen Schwächen. Und das sollte man immer bedenken.*

The rich multinational elite who care only for profit and low wages are the ones who benefit the most from this sort of rapid and irrational immigration policy the EU has been forced to take on. They have no loyalty or respect of sovereignty to any European nation, they care not for its history, traditions and peoples who will clash with that of the migrants from a culture and continent utterly distinct and different from theirs, with an authoritative and sexist religion that has tried before to dominate and enslave the entirety of Europe. 

The super rich benefit from the mass migration and lower wages they can pay to these workers, and the larger labor pool that exists in the EU now as a result which makes it difficult to raise wages and organize unions. Why do you think there is all of this concern and worry that the native European population is declining and must be kept climbing with the constant influx of migrants? Because they care only for profit, to them a stable population undergoing natural growth is not as profitable as one artificially flooded by migrants in a constant rapid influx under the guise of humanitarian and egalitarian aid never before seen in human history.

The poor suffer from the mass migration and lower wages and from having to compete with already poor migrants for work. In Sweden for example, Malmö is seeing high unemployment rates and so their solution to this problem is to import even more migrants because they lack all logical reasoning and common sense. Meanwhile, the innocent people of Europe are beaten, threatened, killed, abused and terrorized by these same migrants, who have no sense of ancestry to the nation they are staying in, living off welfare in, for them and for the multinational elite, Europe is a dumping ground - the concerns and safety of the native Europeans does not matter to them, only profit.

What's more is that any solution to this grave issue is met with instant ridicule and hostility and derided as ""nazi"" and ""racist"" because apparently at some point in history it has become racist and unacceptable to care for the welfare of your own people above that of others. To even suggest a reduction in the influx of migrants is an unspeakable act, this I think is the work of those who benefit and profit from the constant migration and will seek any means necessary to ensure it is not stopped.",null,0,null,1436822207,null,0,false,0,ct25xfo,null,t3_3d4uan,null,t1_ct25xfo,null,t1_ct24jvn,null,null,null,1437828266,null,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15,null

null,false,HighDagger,EURO,European Union,null,"&gt; You are missing the point entirely. If YV is lying, what is your explanation for the fact that the troika totally refused to renegotiate the failed programme?

There are several layers to this.  

a) I don't think I'm missing the point. The comment wasn't made in reply to claims by Varoufakis, but in reply to praise he received for speaking freely. Because of that I felt compelled to point out that he speaks a bit too freely - so freely indeed that not even lies and demagogy are taboo for him.

b) If you find yourself unable to differentiate the context in that way, if you absolutely must apply it to the claims made in this piece, then there are a lot of questions involved in this one.  
Which program exactly? What was that program intended to accomplish from the perspective of the different members of the Troika? Was it implemented in full? If not, then why not and how would that affect the outcome? Do you count it as a failure of the program if it turns out that Greece found itself unwilling to implement it fully? Do you think that it failed from the POV of the troika itself? Did the Troika have a responsibility to give Greece money, or did the responsibility lie with Greece to find creditors willing to lend it more money (under terms acceptable to those lenders)?

All of that aside, when I see how Varoufakis expresses himself I don't see an intelligent person with an honest interest in doing the best with what he's given. I see a person lacking seriousness and someone who refuses to take responsibility for his failure to improve the Greek situation, but who is still completely in love with himself even after that fact.

[shrug]

If their kids were born in the US, they have grown up with a US education and in a US environment, with more-or-less the same ideals and goals that anyone else in the US would haven.  It's not a burden in the way that that some twenty-five-year-old dirt-poor guy walking in with no education, not knowing the language, and requiring support would pose.

I suppose that there might still be cultural influence from parents, and whatever genetics might contribute, and maybe you could go looking for and identify some statistical weakness there, but generally-speaking, [second generation immigrants in the US are on par with the average US citizen](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/02/07/second-generation-americans/): it's first-gen immigrants that are worse-off.

We also don't have the Islam-Christianity split that you are looking at -- Mexicans and Central Americans are Catholic, and the US hasn't had Protestant-Catholic friction for quite a while.

If you wanted to identify poor ethnic or racial groups in the US, and cut out first-gen immigrants, they'd be African-Americans or (native to the US) Native Americans, and these were about the only groups in the US that mostly *didn't* descend from voluntary immigrants: the Native Americans got invaded and the African-Americans got imported as slaves.

I don't know whether the US policy is the best one, and certainly ""immigrate illegally"" isn't a legal, endorsed policy by the US (even if it's something of a *de facto* standard), but it hasn't been catastrophic for the US.",null,0,null,1436822243,null,0,false,0,ct25y79,null,t3_3d4uan,null,t1_ct25y79,null,t1_ct24z8f,null,null,null,1437828276,null,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10,null

&gt; On June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples is unconstitutional. On June 29, the state attorney general ordered clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On July 1, the Fifth Circuit lifted its stay and Judge Reeves ordered an end to Mississippi's enforcement of its same-sex marriage ban. However, until 02 July 2015, several counties in Mississippi continued to refuse to issue same-sex couple marriage licenses, including DeSoto, Jasper, Jones, Newton, Pontotoc, Simpson and Yalbousha.

Texas

&gt;Same-sex marriage is legal in Texas and all other U.S. states as per the U.S. Supreme Court ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges on June 26, 2015.

Louisiana

&gt;In September 2014, two courts, one federal and one state, produced contradictory rulings on the constitutionality of the state's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples. The U.S. Supreme Court resolved that conflict when it ruled such bans unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges on June 26, 2015. Two days later, Governor Bobby Jindal said the state would comply with that ruling and license same-sex marriages.

Arkansas

&gt;Same-sex marriage in Arkansas is legal under the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, a landmark case in which same-sex marriage bans were struck down on June 26, 2015. Prior to that, same-sex marriage in Arkansas was briefly legal for a period beginning on May 9, 2014

Alabama

&gt;Before the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges on June 26, 2015, held that the United States Constitution requires states to recognize and license same-sex marriage, the legal status of same-sex marriage in Alabama was the subject of a long legal battle.

Russia should actually try pretty damn hard to be worse to Greece than EU did.Russia have money and natural gas,they need ways of transporting that gas around Ukraine.Its a win win for both of them.

Worst thing that can happen to Greece with Russia is to have some kind of military base there in exchange for monetary/production services (unlikely though cause Russia have warm water port with Crimea now).

Greece is under bullying conditions, and economic politic in EU isn't best for them. Maybe is aimed for other countries.

The big problem is that this is not ""all Greece fault"". They were promised better results by the EU if they do everything they said ( http://i.imgur.com/5Gj7X4j.png ) but being inside the euro without controlling their own currency and politics is hurting them too much ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJTohA8UwAEzy4q.jpg and http://bit.ly/1SjJSBD ). And they have no clear hope, they don't see end of the tunnel, even if probably is near.

They can't go without paying because they would be next Cuba, their foreign assets will be seized, in bankrupt, unable to trade, nazism inside Greece will continue growing, and the only way out would be Russia.

A new currency does not solve these things. While monetary policy allows you to effectively cheat your economy into being more competitive, it is of no use if your base is completely off track.

A daughter receiving the pension of her father while she is already earning through work? Doesn't sound right, especially for those that really do need it.

When these issues (not just the pension, it's an example, but I'm sure you get that) are fixed, then we can move towards a new economic reality. One in which people are confident to invest.

Their relative cost (in EUR) has already decreased, following their general wage decline. This already forms the base of the needed relative competitiveness that your monitary policy tool aims to.

As for the bail-out fund, I have not seen the specifics (I think Dijsselbloem wasn't even sure about it this morning. He left it over to his 'specialists'.), but I certainly hope that a part of it will go to investing in the Greek economy at its base.

Lass die Implikationen und Schwammigkeit endlich sein, darauf ebenfalls schwammig und implizierend zu antworten verschwendet nur massig Zeit, wie dein extrem entgleister Diskussionsstil nochmals unterstreicht. Hör jetzt mal auf Dich so zu verstecken.

Erkläre, wieso die Einschätzung von Polizeibeamten bezüglich Brandstiftung und Sachbeschädigung (Graffiti und klassische Sachbeschädigung) so gravierend falsch ist und wie es dazu kommt. Schließlich sind Sie es, die Spuren, Zeugenaussagen und Tatort begutachten und dann zu einem Schluss und einer Bewertung (PMK-Rechts oder Ermittelung in andere Richtung: Versicherungsbetrug, Selbstverschuldung, etc pp) gelangen. Wenn Sie deiner Meinung nach zu einem gewissen Anteil falsch rekonstruieren, stelle deine Chance doch bitte dar und rechne es auf die PMK-Rechts-Fälle hoch.

Erkläre ferner bitte, wieso es überführte Täter braucht, wenn Tathergänge rekonstruierbar (und einige sicher auschliessbar) sind und sich Zeugen oder Beweise/Indizien finden. Wenn bei Einbrüchen keine Täter ermittelbar sind, gehst Du dann auch von einer FF-Aktion aus?

Wie sieht es mit dem Motiv [von Rechtsextremisten] aus? Gibt es deutschlandweit keine rechten Szenen und Motive, Straftaten auf Asylheimgelände zu begehen? Warum sollte es -wie von dir impliziert(!)- wenig bis keine politische Straftaten durch sie geben, wenn es [viele Rechtsextremisten](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/f/f1/Rechtsextremismuspotential_in_Deutschland.gif) mit Motiven gibt? Anders gefragt: Wieso sollten Linke ein stärkeres Motiv, als Rechte haben, Hakenkreuze zu schmieren? Die Argumentation des politischen Kapitals kann nicht alleine gelten, so stellt eine FF-Operation doch ein enormes Risiko dar und die Verängstigung der Flüchtlinge läuft dem Interesse der Linken zuwider. Ist es überhaupt eigentlich üblich, dass Rechte, Linke, beziehungsweise generell Sprayer beim Sprühen nicht nur erwischt, sondern auch gestellt werden? Wie willst Du also die Verteilung von FF- und normalen Hakenkreuzen gewichten? Elaborier mal.

Ich glaube nicht, dass Du, wenn Du das sachlich bearbeitest, zu Ergebnissen gelangst die meinen bisherigen Aussagen widersprechen. Ach übrigens: Falls es Dir immer noch nicht aufgefallen ist/auffallen wollte: Ich habe nirgendwo abgestritten, dass es deine paar angeführten Fälle gab und gibt. Gerne auch mit Dunkelziffer. Ich habe lediglich ihre Häufigkeit überaus stark in Zweifel gezogen. Davon werde Ich auch nicht abweichen. Kannst trotzdem ruhig aufhören mit der Schnappatmung ;-)

&gt;Der sich moralisch im Vorteil sehende Linke will dem Rechtskonservativen erklären, das Vorurteile in der Regel korrekt sind und man sich nicht von Fällen, in denen das genaue Gegenteil der Fall war irritieren lassen sollte.

&gt;Solange es Vorurteile gegen rechts sind, versteht sich. In allen anderen Fällen sind Vorurteile natürlich voll scheiße, oder?

Du kannst Dir deine zwei komischen Strohmänner mal schön da einführen wo die Sonne nicht scheint :D

Deine Affekte pro Post müsste man mal zählen.

&gt;Was ich hier sehe ist ein einziger nachgewiesener Angriff [...]

Bullshit. Du hast mir in einem Fall unsaubere Recherche nachgewiesen, das ist schon richtig. Alle anderen Fälle stehen, da die Umstände und Ermittlungsergebnisse ziemlich **einwandfrei** auf PMK-Rechts schließen lassen, auch vonseiten der Polizei. Daran ändert der Umstand, dass es keine Verurteilten gibt, ebenso wie deine Relativierung und Versteifung auf Triggerwörter ins Endlose nicht das Geringste. Dein Standpunkt ist nicht haltbar.

Ich hab übrigens nochmal um den Spaß mit Suchoperatoren rumgespielt. Wieso Ich nicht früher drauf kam nach abgeschlossenen Verfahren zu suchen...keine Ahnung. Wie schlecht von mir. Mit ""festgenommen"", ""Urteil"" und ""Gericht"" und verschiedenen Suchbegriffen [findet](http://www.mz-web.de/mitteldeutschland/anschlag-auf-asylbewerberheim-auch-nach-einem-jahr-kein-prozessende-in-sicht,20641266,18558878.html) [man](http://www.pnn.de/pm/955035/) [noch](https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/schleswig-holstein/Anschlag-in-Escheburg-Zwei-Jahre-auf-Bewaehrung,escheburg180.html) [ganz](http://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/ueberfall-asylbewerberheim-apolda100_zc-e9a9d57e_zs-6c4417e7.html) [nette](https://www.derwesten.de/staedte/duisburg/rauchbomben-anschlag-auf-asylbewerberheim-vor-gericht-id10642414.html) [Ergebnisse](http://www.op-marburg.de/Lokales/Ostkreis/Angreifer-auf-Asylbewerberheim-verurteilt), aber bei zu vielen Suchbegriffen macht der Suchalgorithmus irgendwann schlapp. Zu Gerichtsverfahren auschließlich(!) wegen Schmierereien findet man kaum was; kaum aufklärbar, zu unwichtig. Naja, ist jetzt auch egal, das wird mir jetzt zu langweilig. Da war aber noch viel mehr, such doch selber mal =)

&gt;Du hast so getan, als gäbe es jede Woche einen neuen Fall in dem Nazis versucht haben ein Flüchtlingsheim samt Bewohnern abzufackeln. Da dürfte es doch ohne nennenswerten Aufwand möglich sein ein paar Fälle zu googeln, oder? Das hat nichts mit ""low effort"" zu tun, es ließ sich einfach nichts finden.

Total falsch. Man möchte fast denken, Du magst gar nicht sachlich diskutieren :D

Dass das ""1x pro Woche PMK-Rechts-Thread"" das schöne Stilmittel der Exaggeration darstellt, sieht doch jeder Depp. Ziemlich unlauter wie Du das wörtlich auslegst. Ferner hab ich von PMK-Rechts geredet, nicht Anschlägen auf Asylheime. Du solltest wirklich aufhören, dein Gegenüber so zu verzerren.

&gt;Im Zweifel daraus einen rechtsterroristischen Anschlag zu machen und so zu agieren, als wäre es bereits eine erwiesene Tatsache ist also besser, oder wie?

Was für ein Gelaber.

Noch eine kurze Darlegung; es ist ganz einfach: Werden in einer Asylunterkunft Straftaten verübt, ermittelt die Polizei. Nach Zeugen(Bewohner) und Indizien/Beweisen. Man beachte: Viele Bewohner sind sich oft unbekannt, je nach Heimsituation. Denunziation durch Mitbewohner ist grundsätzlich einzubeziehen. Du konntest bis jetzt **einen** Fall nachweisen, wo Hakenkreuze als FF im Asylheim gemalt werden. Es gab sonst keinen bekannten Fall, bei dem die Polizei dahingehend Hinweise bekam oder Ermittlungsergebnisse erlangte. Dagegen gibt es Neonazis ganz real. Es gibt Graffittis überall. Es gab auch schon richtig kranke Ausschreitungen. Brandanschläge mit Verletzten/Toten wie Lichtenhagen und Solingen. Es gibt hin und wieder kleine Auseinandersetzungen. Die Szene ist immer diesselbe. Also ist die Chance, dass Rechte auch kleinere Straftaten auf Asylheimgelände begehen doch ganz hoch. Imho um einiges höher und simpler, als deine FF-Szenarios.

Wie bereits gesagt: Kommen wir uns zu 50/50 entgegegen (ach, bin Ich so kulant), würden [immer noch dutzende](http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/048/1804821.pdf) Hakenkreuze pro Quartal auf Asylheime geschmiert. An der Stelle schreibe Ich lieber: Keine Gewähr, vielleicht gibts zu viele andere Delikte, Ich hab nicht nachgerechtet. Bevor Du Schlingel hier wieder angreifst.

&gt;Hier ein besonders dreistes Beispiel:

Schön, Du bist bei drei. Ich habe noch acht plus sechs. Way to go. Stehst doch auf die Aufrechnerei ;-)

&gt;Ein Hakenkreuz zu schmieren ist denkbar einfach und lässt sich politisch sauber ausschlachten. Tatsächlich könnte man genausogut scheiße bauen und hinterher ""antifaschistische Aktion"", einen roten Stern oder Ähnliches hinterlassen. Nur würden sich dann zig einflussreiche Leute zu Wort melden und false flag brüllen. Umgekehrt macht das kein Mensch.

Most arguments I've seen here recently basically operate on an emotional, non-factual level (""hardline attitude"", ""willing to compromise"", ""demaging her view over here"", ""UK is more on the fear side than the love side""). I think what's missing in the whole mess is a more systematic approach and clearer thinking.

A tangentially related idea I've been thinking about: when two parties are negotiating, a systematic way to look at the process is this.

1. You create a set of possible deals.
2. For every such deal, estimate how will it affect either party. For example, deal D will have a +10 effect for the first party and +1 effect for the second one. It's a win-win deal, but the first party benefits way more. The numbers are relative to the no-deal option, which has a 0 effect to both parties by definition.
3. The real question is, what deal is reasonable for both parties. But even though there's not an easy answer to that, the decision-making should be much clearer at this point.

So I think what's needed when discussing the Greece crisis is a set of possible solutions with estimated costs.

Here, a more recent social research study published 2014 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814000305


&gt; Abstract

&gt; In this study, I examined the social problems LGBT individuals go through in their hometowns and later, in the places they move to. Data were collected using semistructured interviews that included thirty four open - and close-ended questions.
&gt; 
&gt; The sample is compsosed of 18 male and 12 female participants which makes 30 in total, residing in any city in Turkey. The findings demonstrate that LGBT individuals are exposed to verbal harassment and physical abuse, they are not accepted and are not able to perform social activities in their hometowns or if they migrated, in the places they moved to.

I don't dispute this, but Varoufakis studied at Essex and Birmingham.  He isn't an idiot.  He knows exactly how words/phrases will be interpreted differently in Greece vs Western Europe or the US.  

If he is giving an interview to a Western European magazine, it seems dishonest to then apply how a Greek audience would interpret the statement because he wasn't talking to a Greek audience.

Cultural differences matter and I don't believe that V. is actually stupid enough not to know this and take this into account.  More likely that he was being intentionally toxic, knowing that he had a flimsy excuse that his supporters would parrot over and over.

On the other hand, if he really is that stupid to not understand how cultural differences affect interpretations of a message, then how in the fuck did the Greeks send him to negotiations for so long?

Yes.

This wasn't caused by people treating them unfairly, it was by their own overspending. If anything, the rates should have gone up *before* 2008.

&gt; Also, if the ECB did the job of lender of last resort from the start then the Greeks would not need this bailout package at all.

If they had lower interest rates, but the same ballooning overspending, then they still would have needed a bailout at some point.

We only seem to hate corruption when it doesn't benefit us, we only seem to believe politicians are guilty if they're from the party we don't vote for, we have no principles. Tons of Romanians take advantage of corruption and they will never agree with a corruption-free society because that means that they'll stop benefitting from a few things too.

Stop and think about that.  

He self-titled his major submission to resolve the crises after a satirical essay that offers no actual solutions and is mainly aimed at attacking and demonizing those that the author feels are responsible for the current financial crises.

When someone self-aligns their major contribution to the discussion after an essay that offers no solutions and only attacks his perceived enemies, *maybe, just maybe* that guy isn't the person to handle negotiations.

If you do put that guy in charge, then how can you blame anyone else when he proceeds to piss everyone off and negotiations go absolutely nowhere?

Germany also exports more to EU countries than they import and it has a trade surplus with almost every Eurozone country.

So a German made car would be more expensive in Greece than a Greek made car, this would push consumers to buy Greek cars. 

But now everyone in the Eurozone has to trade with Germany in Euros and so the automatic depreciation that used to happen no longer happens. That German car is now just cheap as that Greek car in Greece. So people buy the German cars because they are better.

That said, within an organization like the EU, there's always a certain amount of competition for dominance, and if we start to see the EU play a bigger role in security issues, some of that competition may be borne out through the ability of the states involved to contribute to those goals. Since most of these will be asymmetric conflicts, France's ability to project power — not just through naval air power, but long range strategic lift capabilities — will give it a decisive advantage over Germany. The campaign to oust Qaddafi for example was heavily instigated by the UK and France, both of which played significant parts in the campaign. Germany could never do something like that as it stands now. Same goes for the French military involvement recently in Mali and CAR. 

Within Europe, really only the UK can rival France in this respect, but the UK seems reluctant to do so since Iraq, somewhat understandably. 

Security issues in Africa and the Middle East are clearly very relevant to European countries, and while the US is of course willing to deal with these issues more or less on it's own, Europe needs to be willing to take an active role in the events of the world that affect it.

From the ""immessurable gratitude"" that would be shown if Germany would go for debt relief. Germany is not the only country that isn't willing to sink money in Greece. I doubt that any EU country would show immessurable gratitude if we force them to forgive debt. 

If Germany would push for debt restructuring it would just be different countries that would be angry at us. 


&gt; I stand by my claim.

Doesn't change that you are wrong. Look at this chart: http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/

You will see that the first Eurozone installment is due in June 2020, 181.25 million Euro. That is money the Eurozone could restructure ""without cost except getting less future profit"". 

The 14.8 billion Euro Greece has to pay back to treasury bill holders until January 2016 have to be taken from somewhere. The 5 billion Euro Greece owes to the IMF in this year have to be taken from somewhere as well. And lets not forget the 6.6 billion Euro the ECB wants back this year.   
Greece might be able to refinance the T-Bills, but ECB and IMF cannot be refinanced, they have to be paid back.

There was always this difference between RO and BG in that the top level thieves were much more physically violent in BG, while in RO they were much more focused on appearing immaculate and creating webs of corruption (power in great numbers) and change the laws to white-wash their deeds. I would argue that while physical violence is more scary and spectacular, being able to change laws so that thousands can legally steal is much more damaging.

Yes, austerity is very poor at creating growth. No, growth is not the goal of austerity. Austerity is the kind of thing you put in place when the established system and politicians can no longer be trusted to handle money, when investors have lost confidence (even more so when your credit rating is literally 'trash'). Austerity is an emergency brake and the only thing that guarantees that countries live within their means. And the way to stop austerity is by restoring that confidence (which both Tsipras and Varoufakis not only spectacularly failed to do, but effectively worked against with all this demagoguery and grandstanding).

Greece borrowed money from banks.  The payment was due, and Greece couldn't pay it back.  At this point, the banks are without the money and Greece has spent it.

So the options are default, which would be really bad for Greece, or come up with a new plan.  The new plan includes lending more money to Greece, and giving them longer to pay back the old debt.

The banks are without even more money, and Greece's debt got bigger.

How do you think that ""the banks got tens of billions""?  The only way that could be true is if you think Greece shouldn't have had to pay back the money in the first place.

But that kind of thinking (spending and spending without thinking about the growing debt) is what got Greece where it is today.  

It is a fact that the banks are without the money.  It is a fact that the banks haven't been repair.

&gt;Denn in Deutschland haben Aufzüge in der Regel keine Ausstiegsluken. Diese werden nur auf Kundenwunsch eingebaut und sind verriegelt. Dafür gibt es unterschiedliche Mechanismen: Manche können nur mit einem Schlüssel geöffnet werden, andere mit einem Dreikant. Etwa 50 mal 50 Zentimeter groß sind die Klappen.

iirc it would even have been sustainable with a primary surplus of 3.5% and 1% growth a year. Greece being able to borrow in the open market at something like a 5% long term interest rate certainly suggests that it was pretty close to sustainable.

former senior Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) official, Ryan Grist, who was in charge of unarmed monitors in South Ossetia at war's start,[68] told the BBC in November 2008 that he had been warning of Georgia's military activity before its move into the South Ossetia region, saying there was a ""severe escalation"" and that this ""would give the Russian Federation any excuse it needed in terms of trying to support its own troops.""[69]

According to Grist, it was Georgia that launched the first military strikes against Tskhinvali. ""It was clear to me that the [Georgian] attack was completely indiscriminate and disproportionate to any, if indeed there had been any, provocation,” he said. “The attack was clearly, in my mind, an indiscriminate attack on the town, as a town.”[70] Grist's views were echoed by Stephen Young, who was another senior OSCE official in Georgia at the time. According to him, there had been no extensive shelling of the Georgian villages on the evening or night of August 7. Young added, that if there had been shelling of Georgian villages that evening, the OSCE monitors at the scene would have heard it. According to him, the monitors only heard occasional small arms fire.[3][70]

Georgia, and some Western diplomats in Tbilisi later questioned Grist's objectivity.[68][71] The OSCE curbed the attempts by The New York Times to interview the monitors, saying they would not be publicly engaged in disagreement.[3] Terhi Hakala, head of the OSCE mission to Georgia, called the monitors' claims ""a bit irrelevant.""[68] OSCE Deputy Spokeswoman Virginie Coulloudon told the journalists that the organization's monitors make ""patrol reports"" from the ground ""on a daily basis."" Coulloudon also said that ""the OSCE is not in a capacity to say who started the war and what happened before the night of [August] 7-8.""[72] Journalists documented dozens of eyewitnesses' accounts that confirmed the reports that Pro-Moscow separatist forces had been shelling the Georgian villages before August 7. The eyewitness accounts are also consistent with a report issued on 5 August 2008, by a tripartite monitoring group, which included Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) observers and representatives of Russian peacekeepers in the region. The report, signed by the commander of Russian peacekeepers, General Marat Kulakhmetov, said there was evidence of attacks against ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia. The report also stated that South Ossetian separatists were using heavy weapons against the Georgian villages, which was prohibited by a 1992 cease-fire agreement.[72]

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote that in an interview Grist acknowledged he crossed through Russian lines without authorization on his own initiative to determine the facts, which ultimately cost him his OSCE job. He was forced to resign from the OSCE immediately after the war. WSJ adds Grist remains ""scathing"" about Georgian actions before and during the war, but says that some of his comments have been overinterpreted and quotes Grist saying ""I have never said there was no provocation by the South Ossetians."" ""What I have said is that the response from the Georgian authorities was absolutely disproportionate,"" said Ryan Grist.[68]

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Ryan Grist said that on 12 August he went to visit a friend in Tskhinvali, Lira Tskhovrebova, who was well connected with the separatist authorities. Friends took him to see two top South Ossetian officials. On the road to Tbilisi Grist was stopped by South Ossetian militia. He shouted the names of the officials he had just been meeting ""so they wouldn't shoot"" him.[68] In December 2008, an investigation by the Associated Press revealed that Lira Tskhovrebova was not an independent activist as she claimed. She was allegedly connected to South Ossetian KGB and Russian intelligence agency, the FSB. Matthew Bryza, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, also expressed his doubts about Tskhovrebova.[73][74]",null,0,null,1436829339,null,0,false,0,ct2acb2,null,t3_3d4t8m,null,t1_ct2acb2,null,t1_ct2a2io,null,null,null,1437831605,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

however from the beginning (starting with the campaign that got them elected) it seems that they have overestimated their leverage.

their point of view was that the ez wouldn't want to risk greece dropping out of the ez at all costs. however if you make this assumption public the other side will try to take that leverage from you by actually preparing for that. 

then add the last six months and the really horrible timing for a meaningless referendum and all of the sudden even the tiniest leverage (not to mention the big one syriza assumed they have) is gone and actually turned the other way.

in the end schäuble and his like minded fellows won, as much as i disagree with it.

syriza wanted to pressure the ez with their exit that they thought the austerity minded countries wouldn't risk and schäuble went along.

in the end: you can blame greek governments partially for the current situation, but not in the whole. this whole situations could've been targeted from a completely different angle for a while now but it wasn't and this is also the fault of the austerity fraction.

the greek people can't really be blamed though. extremely simplified (as the rest of this post): shit went wrong in their country so they voted for an actual alternative.

How much of that governing the world through the will of the King represents a modern democracy?

Also if you'd have read this article (British based, so I'm not surprised by it leaning heavily towards the UK). You'd see that the bail-out would require a majority vote of 85% of the member states, weighted by population. Seems extremely fair in a democracy (where actually the general rule is 50%+1 or in some cases 66%).

Perhaps you should interest yourself more in EU politics. Get to know the people who become in charge? Also, it shouldn't be about who can scream the loaded to get the spot.

Also, the Commonwealth may be bigger, but in essence it holds no political power and basically is just a union of former colonies. Nothing close to the eventual goal of the EU.

NATO HQ is also in Brussels and far from the actual head of NATO. This is actually the US.

That is essentially a bailout of the creditors, since all you're doing is sending money on a round-trip through Athens for the benefit of the creditors. In my opinion that is not the best answer. It produces moral hazard for the creditors, and doesn't even solve the problem. (If the problem *was* fully solved by just handing over some money to the creditors to cover the loans, I would grit my teeth and accept bailing out the bankers as the necessary price of a solution.)

My preferred solution would be more like a bankruptcy court's typical proceedings: require Greece to pay x% a year of their income towards the debt, calculate how much they could pay in 30 years doing that, and cancel the rest.

&gt;And no whatever the definition of ""civilized word"" mean wich doesnt exist by the way

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech

Dude it's RIGHT THERE:

Hate speech is, outside the law, **speech that attacks a person** or group **on the basis of** attributes such as **gender**, ethnic origin, religion, race, disability, or **sexual orientation**.

Do you even read?? Again, thanks for giving me the links to disprove you! You are awesome!

---

&gt; Wich you have not been able, I mean cant even do proper maths

Show me my math is incorrect, otherwise you are just grasping at straws.

---

&gt; Wich neighborhood and part of the citiy they were again ?

No idea. It's irrelevant anyway. In the Jew video there was nothing outrageous. Mostly people calling him a Jew and two insults. Annoying, sure, but no crime.

---

&gt; And 0 sources

I used yours (I said this three times already, lol)

---

&gt; Let see

&gt; Moscow 13 millions citizens

&gt; Berlin: 3 milions

Let's. Careful, I'm going **to use math**!

Berlin: 474 attacks, 3.5M people (2014). Since an average of 4% of people are gay, Berlin has an estimated population of 140,000 homosexuals.

Let's use math and averages. Divide 474/140,000 = each gay person suffers 0.00338 attacks per year. Divided by 365 = 0,0000093 attacks per day.

Now Moscow. I'm going to be generous and just count 10 offences from the video (there are more, but ok). These two people suffered 10 attacks in one day. Let's divide 10/2 = 5 attacks per person per day. But, Moscow is bigger than Berlin, let's adjust. Moscow has 12.2M people (2015), so Moscow is 12.2/3.5 = 3.48 times bigger than Berlin. So adjusting 5/3.48 = 1.43 attacks per day.

* In **Berlin** each homosexual suffers **0.0000093** attack per day on average (1 per 300 years).
* In **Moscow** each homosexual suffers **1.43** attacks per day on average... if they just hold hands and keep themselves to crowded street during daylight.

---

&gt; What does that have to do with what I wrote , what is the link with my previous messages?

Here it is:

&gt;&gt; BTW, I don't want to even imagine if they kissed... or they walked at night... or in small alleys.

&gt; Yeah bla bla bla(completely delusionnal)

Happy to help! :)

---

&gt; What do you want sources where people walk among people on the street that are dying or in need??

Dying or in need? LOL, textbook strawman argument. Look at what I wrote:

&gt; In Moscow **you threaten to beat a couple of gays** and **no one even stops to look**. 

Address that.

---

&gt; Gay people kiss = Attact, insult and discrimination in western countries (It doesnt help that its on the rise)

In western countries, two gays kiss:

* You ask them to get off the bus = you're fired.
* You insult them = you're fired
* You punch them = you're fired, expelled from school and the FBI investigates you.

In Russia:

* You ask them to get off the bus = no example

Let's try anyway. First of all, you need good bowel resistance, since you'll frequently go from hot outside to places with AC. Then you'll better not be lactose intolerant, since you'll need plenty of gelato. 

Grom stores have good gelato and spawn across the city. If you're near one Gelateria della Musica, definitely go there. I also love Lo Gnomo Gelato. Sorry, no links, I'm from mobile. 

If you're strolling or shopping near pizza Duomo, corso Vittorio Emanuele, corso Buenos Aires, piazza San Babila there are some large book shops, La Feltrinelli and Mondadori: there's AC there and often a cafeteria inside. They have comfortable seats for customers and visitors, you can chill a bit there. 

La Rinascente is a fancy megastore near Duomo, if you're into fashion or design peek there and go to the attic for a drink. 

If you like eating and drinking, look for Eataly: world famous, good food, indoor so air conditioned. 

I leave to others suggestions about pools, never tried anything: but I sometimes go to the local spa, Terme Milano. If you like spas, that's a nice one. There are of course small pools, not to swim but to relax of course. There's also an old tram converted to sauna, but for 1.50 euros you can take a regular tram and have a sauna there too. 

One nice indoor experience is Dialogo nel Buio, where you'll discover what it means to be a blind person: amazing, check it out. 

Museums are another indoor activity: I recommend Museo delle Scienze e della Tecnica and Museo del Novecento. 

Biggest park is Parco Sempione, if you'll visit then Castle you'll find it. Castle also has a large fountain in front where you can get a bit of restoration. 

If you're going to Navigli for Aperitivo or Happy Hour, maybe you want to have some juicy fruit before, there's a nice covered market nearby in the new Darsena area. Ask for a sweet mango, they have spectacular ones. How you'll eat it I don't know... 

Finally, maybe a good beer will help you get some minerals back: I highly suggest La Belle Alliance near Navigli or Birrificio di Lambrate. 

Have a nice stay and ask if you have any question!

We must be living in parallel universes. In the universe I live in, the Greek government had absolutely no leverage, and was basically pleading with the Troika to allow a slightly milder austerity package. Saying Greece tried to ""strongarm"" the EZ is like saying a flea tried to strongarm a bull.

&gt; Syriza had to accept a worse deal than any other government because they managed to ride down greece even more. 

The clear intention of the German government has been to utterly humiliate the Greek government. By not accepting Greece's complete capitulation on Friday, but rather demanding far-ranging additional right-wing economic measures, the German government has achieved that. Most economists on the other side of the pond don't believe that the reforms Germany is insisting on will foster a Greek economic recovery. Much the opposite, they think they'll be devastating to Greece. This isn't about helping Greece recover from the deterioration in its economy over the last few months of negotiations.

The thing is if greece does not reform how are we ever supposed to get out of th is crisis?

Europe can barely manage a humanitarian crisis involving a few thousand migrants per week, talk about aid for Greece was just that, a minor thing to say we're not that bad.

And Greece did reduce spending and followed the program faithfully to the point where it lost 25% of it's economic capacity, if you were in there shoes how would you judge when enough is enough? Could you imagine 25% of German economic capacity and production being destroyed? It's easy to say from the sidelines, ""Why didn't they?"", and sadly now that attitude has poisoned EU politics, and we are no better for an actual solution. The austerity agenda won, Greeks will ""put up"" with further spending reductions on top of existing reductions, and how the outcome can be different when doing the same thing is beyond me.

I really believe that since coming to power, Syriza has consistently not taken this reality into account and completely misread what the reaction to most of their major decisions were going to be. In my opinion the quintessence of this was when Syriza claimed that a ""No"" in the referendum would allow them to have a better bargaining position and allow banks to reopen within 24hours. The ""No"" result gave way to the polar opposite: trust was lost and they were forced into an even worse deal, and banks have not reopened. 

The thing is I don't think that Syriza's anti-austerity approach was fundementally flawed. I think that believing that they could enact these policies and stay in the Euro was the problem. I really believe that what would have been best for Greece in the long run would have been a controlled and aided Grexit as early as the start of the year.

That's of course way too late to start an analysis of Greece's situation. I don't know the details of Greece's economy at the end of 2014, but if I recall right, austerity measures were being cut back already. And with the big plunge before, a slightly growing GDP is not that impressive. Anyway, extrapolating from such a short period of relief is not really significant.

&gt; Seems like the Greek people brought this on themselves?

The big picture is that Greece has been lent a lot of money, and a big part from Germany. Greece has huge military spendings (it's a NATO border state, so there are surely international contracts involved here), and Germany is one of the biggest exporters of military equipment. In other words: Germany wanted Greece to take on debt, because if Greece didn't buy, Germany couldn't sell!

So, no, saying they brought it on themselves is too easy. I'm not saying Greece is not at fault, but they're not the only ones to blame. Had we had a common economic policy, then the reasonable thing would have been to create a level playing field: strengthen Greece's (and others') economies, but also ""weaken"" Germany's. Their enormous export quota means that they sell too cheap; the German people are overdue for a huge pay raise.

Apart from the question of economy, there is also politics. What happened to Greece in the previous years is simply undemocratic. The Troika, not elected by the Greek people, effectively passed laws. Syriza was elected because the previous government did not work for the Greek people any more. What the institutions demanded of Greece was not to present a plausible plan, but to implement their plan.

I remember I had that same feeling of bewilderment when I was told a story about how my grandfather was injured in the Dublin bombings of 1974, after a unionist paramilitary group set off a bomb near Parnell street. 

Of course, this all occurred within the span of the Ulster workers council strike, which was exacerbated by Merlyn Rees's refusal to use adequate force in addressing the situation so tensions were at a high point. What amazed me even more was the fact that the same people who took part in this ""strike"" weren't that different. In terms of class, these people were almost identical to my grandfather and yet, they hated him. 

For a long time, I used to hold the EU in such high regard. It was something that represented a complete juxtaposition to the bickering that led to nationalism. 

It's a shame that ever since Greece attempted to renegotiate the memorandum, a program which has been a complete and utter failure, I have been reminded of that bickering. I can't help but think that I was just a naive idealist.

First we had reunification, which basically turned into 25 years of stagnating wages (yes, it got better in the last couple of years) and rebuilding half of the country with money that had been used elsewhere before. Oh, and they introduced a ""special one-time"" tax called ""Solidaritätszuschlag"", which was supposed to be a one time thing, but has yet to be abolished. But yeah, that'll never happen since Angie has publicly stated she wants to keep the Soli even after the law runs out in 2019.

Then, I think it was around the year 2000, after being laughed at by almost the whole world as ""the sick man of Europe"", Germans got probably the harshest labor market reform in the history of the Federal Republic, called Hartz IV (pronounced ""hearts fear"", and that's actually what people do). To illustrate this, I personally was able to enjoy two months of the old system before I started university, I got 600€/month, and that was the *lowest* amount you could get. Today that would be 380€/month and that measly amount WILL get slashed if you don't comply with the demands of your local ""agency for work"" (for clarification, rent, health care and such are not included here, that is handled separately), and part of this is to be available every weekday from 8 to 5 for them to call you and send you anywhere for job interviews or call you in on short notice. In fact, this whole thing is so hilariously German that you can take a vacation (since every German has a right to take ~20 days/year) from being unemployed! Another part of this piece of legislation was an unprecedented extension of low paying temporary employment, which even the people who wrote the law called abhorrent.

And there's more! Pensions were cut, retirement age was increased, health care benefits were cut, infrastructure programs were ""postponed"" (just check Internet speeds for Germany, or the state some municipal roads are in). Additionaly, Deutsche Telekom, the postal service and the railway agency were privatized. And the fact that today we see strikes in almost every sector and with an alarming frequency speaks volumes. I could make other examples, but I think you get my point.

To be perfectly clear, I'm neither condoning Merkel's policies nor am I trying to say that Germans are ""right"" to think this way.

This is all just papering over cracks, but not implementing any long term changes which will prevent such a situation from reoccurring.

But for movies I'd recommend Schule, Die Welle, Lola rennt, maybe Anatomie, maybe Rossini and Sonnenallee. Frauenknast was said to be a good series, but I was to small for that at the time. RTL had some good some very trashy (comedy) series. I'd recommend Mein Leben und Ich. Gaby Kösters' und Atze's characters have not really become timeless and I can't say much about Balko, Der Clown, etc.

Going back even further, I'd say Ein Herz und eine Seele is a german staple, it's just very german.

But back in the day, there a lot of great german shows. There was Bullyparade, the original Switch was pretty good, Wochenshow had things like Brisko Schneider, which were hilarious at the time. Raab was getting started and producing really good content like Raab in Gefahr. Blondes Gift, Kalkofes Mattscheibe, Genial Daneben (a bit newer), Ulmen was doing Comedy and not other Viva presenters, VOX had the dctp night club, which was very interesting. There was RTL Samstag Nacht, ""Alles, Nichts, Oder?"", Hallervorden, Sketch Up, Frei Schnautze, Freitag Nacht News and lots of different game shows.
Reading through the old Tv programmes makes me realize how many shows and how few series (besides of soaps) we produce(d).

&gt;Do you even read?? Again, thanks for giving me the links to disprove you! You are awesome!

And again saying ""Bitches"" is not hate speech


So let see and I quote


&gt;In law, hate speech is any speech, gesture or conduct, writing, or display which is forbidden because **it may incite violence or prejudicial action against or by a protected individual** or group or because it disparages or intimidates a protected individual or group.


Say the word ""Bitch"" does not incite violence or hate in fact in the video they are none  **at that**, in fact they are nothinh that incite violence.

&gt; Let's. Careful, I'm going to use math

And again false , 

Your stats does not account for the percentage of people that are LGBT in Moscow  and still base only on one sample and still dont have a **year on year** data for Moscow , Those stats  might have been the only attact in one year :) (That is an exageration but the point stay).

It doesnt help that they are less than  **3 homophobic slurs** in the entire video, I mean they are subtitle!!

Saying the word ""gay"" is not a slur by the way nor hate speech and you wouldnt be charge


&gt;In western countries, two gays kiss:

And again more nonsensical drivel, I asked you what happen when two gay poeple kiss not what happen to their perpetrators I dont care nor does that seems to have an impact.


So let see and I wil repeat :)


Two gay people kiss in western countries = Discrimination , insult , attact

But it doesnt stop here even with punishement,  Homophobic attact is still on the rise :)

&gt;Under a plan drawn up in the small hours of Sunday night as leaders wrestled to save Greece from economic collapse, Mr Juncker, the president of the European Commission, wants to revive a mothballed bailout fund. It will use the EU budget as collateral against 8.6 billion euros of short-term bridging loans to Greece.

(The budget consists of the membership dues that all member states provide every year so that the EU institutions can function. It makes up approximately 1% of each country's GDP. The national institutions of each member states is usually between 40% and 60%)

The idea is that all EU member states (not just Eurozone member states) should provide assistance to another EU member state in need. 

Personally I've always thought that it was silly that non-Eurozone countries were providing almost no funds to other EU countries in need. If the Euro collapses, or a Euro-zone economy collapses, then we're all screwed, whether we use the Euro or not, because we're all tied together in the common market. 

It shouldn't be up to just those EU economies which are most tightly integrated to suffer all of the burdens. The money which France and Germany and all the others have put in to help Greece and Ireland and co. has helped the entire European Union, and the European continent more broadly.

**Die Zeit Editor**: Germany didn't win. Greece will have the last laugh. Tsipras cannot/will not follow through on reforms. Greece now knows Grexit threat was hollow. Waiting on fourth bailout, business as usual.

**British Economics Professor**: Monetary union not feasible in this large an area with so many divergences. Germany must allow EU policies similar to what it did in the 90s, so other EU countries can also achieve real competitiveness and export. Who will buy German goods if austerity chokes demand?

**Irish Economist**: Ireland and Greece first two states bailed out. Ireland exited within two years, Greece still stuck. In spite of grinding austerity, Irish economy was more flexible with good exports and mostly private labour market. Also functioning government. Greece doesn't have all those, so long road to recovery.

**Editor of Athens daily *Kathimereni***: Amateur Tsipras failed on all counts. No preparation or clear plan, aimless wandering for most of the time in government, only realising late that Greece cannot afford Grexit. Now faces immense task and has mandate from the referendum, but it won't be easy.

**Syriza MP/economist who abstained on vote**: Monetary union has failed because Germany has become dominant by exporting and running trade surpluses. Greece needs detailed exit plan to be able to recover. Syriza's election strategy successful but governance strategy miserable. Package will not solve problems, prospect of Grexit will raised again soon.

**Former FinMin of Slovakia**: Nonsense to offer bailout based on past experience. Germany and others preferred Grexit but blocked by France &amp; Italy. Will not work because Greek politicians cannot/will not implement reforms. 

**Editor of French website *Rue89***: Hollande did well. Bitterness on the French Left at terms. Relieved that no Grexit, but arrogance of deal will not help it get accepted in Greece, or make Europe more popular among Europeans.",null,0,null,1436836290,null,0,false,0,ct2eddm,null,t3_3d71b6,null,t1_ct2eddm,null,t3_3d71b6,null,null,null,1437834494,null,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12,null

Nothing short of a miracle would turn the Greek economy around so fast. This has lingered since 2008, it shows no signs of going away.

&gt; Just because there was some bullying going on here doesn't mean that the day to day workings of the EU have been compromised.

I don't know what to say to that, ah sure it was just a bit of playing around?!? 

&gt;Also , you lamented that the outcome wasn't sustainable. What exactly would you classify as a sustainable solution? **Writing off Greece's debt** would help them in the short run, but without conditions attached, there is nothing stopping them from doing it all again. Also, writing off their debt would likely create even more instability across the EU. The turmoil that it would create amongst the people of creditor countries would be immense, it could even bring down a few governments. It could be argued that writing off their debt would be the most undemocratic thing to do since the majority of the people from the creditor countries would disagree.

This is what confuses me, are you aware that Syriza were **not** actually negotiating for a write-off and choose to ignore it pretending for the sake of argument that they were? Or is your position based on an incomplete picture of what was being requested? Even Noonan came out in the end and said debt ""reprofiling"" would be needed.

Restructuring, reprofiling, promisory notes....debt is a complex instrument and there are many ways to manage it. It might still happen, but now under the current proposed program, any debt restructuring over the long term will be so buried in short term contraction that it will be of little value in turning the Greek economy around. It's worth bearing in mind that Greek capacity to pay in the future is tied in with future success in growing it's economy which makes the current short termism of winning the political battle seem so futile.

&gt; Russians actually died over Georgia, NATO troops didn't.

True, I  think Nilbop is underestimating Russia's penchant for war.

&gt; And what happened when the Allies stopped appeasing Germany? Did the Germans just roll over, or did the world plunge into the bloodiest conflict to date?

What would you suggest as the alternative? Invasive forces get stronger the more they're appeased. We IGNORED Germany's taking over the world, we failed to stop it until it was too late and we're damned lucky things went the way they did (*ironic and Irishman saying that, I know*). We have to try stop these things before they happen again, and we have to try do it without missiles and tanks and nuclear arms. Sanctions are the first step, but I don't see any problem with NATO putting troops on Russia's doorstep either. If they have no intention of expanding, there shouldn't be any problem.

LOL are you serious? Of course it does! That's the whole point of saying it!

&gt; And again false , I told you drop that math

You are pathetic. Math turns against you and you tell me ""to drop that math""? That is the weakest, most desperate argument I've seen in a long time.

&gt; Your stats does not account for the percentage of people that are LGBT in Moscow

Of course not. It does not need to. I only used it for find out the attacks/person in Berlin since the data I had is attack/person in Moscow. It's called normalization. Look it up.

&gt;  on one sample and still dont have a year on year data for Moscow ,

When the Russian police start take violence against gays seriously, I'll have that data and I'll do the math again. Until then I work with what data I have.

&gt;  Those stats might have been the only attact in one year

Nope, when you take a sample you assume it's representative. All other data (and anecdotal evidence) seem to give the same results. Therefore the sample is representative. 

&gt; Did the gay in Brlin kissh each other or hold their hands?

Of course. And they go to dark clubs at night and they get drunk and make out. And they go shopping for groceries. And they go on vacation. And they get sick and hold each other hands at the doctor. Just like hetero people do (I guess it must sound strange to a Russian, but really, they are just people).

&gt;  In that case why not double.

Wish granted, I will double it for no reason at all. 0.0000093 x 2 = **0.0000186** attacks per day. Almost got close to the **1.43** attacks a day from Moscow. But not quite.

&gt; It doesnt help that they are less than 6 homophobic slurs in the videos

Plus two aggressions, plus threats, plus generic non-slur insults. Hence my number: 10 attacks. It's lower than it should, but it's nice and round.

&gt; And again more nonsensical drivel, I asked you what happen when two gay poeple kiss not what happen to their perpetrators.

What happens when two gay people kiss? When, you get two kissing people! Nobody cares. No one is getting hurt. You do realize that in many countries gay people can marry and have/adopt children right? They form families, are happy, get on with their lives. In 99.9999% of cases, absolutely nothing happens. People just don't give a shit that you are gay. In 0.00009% of cases: the bus driver asks them to get of the bus. In 0.00001% of cases they are attacked.

&gt; Two gay people kiss = Discrimination , insult , attact

Yes, that is what happens in Russia, I know. I have seen the video and they didn't even kiss.

In the west, when two gay people kiss = no one cares. If someone cares it is soooo rare that it ends up in the news, like plane crash (incidentally, also Russia's speciality).

This is a video of two actors in the one most anti-gay areas of ""the west"", namely the souther united states: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAXOrxW6GTg
They hold hands. They kiss. They propose marriage. No one gives a shit. Good for them. People carry on with their lives.

&gt; Homophobic attact is still on the rise :)

Yes, from 474 cases per year to maybe 480. Or 490. While (just in Berlin) there are 10k traffic accidents a year. So it means that you are 20 times more likely to have a traffic accident than to witness a homophobic attack.

Well, that's how it is, isn't it? Russia took what it wanted, NATO didn't wanted Georgia enough to do anything. 

&gt;What would you suggest as the alternative? Invasive forces get stronger the more they're appeased. We IGNORED Germany's taking over the world, we failed to stop it until it was too late and we're damned lucky things went the way they did (ironic and Irishman saying that, I know). 

And when the Allies finally tried to stop it, there was this huge war, and Germany was defeated. 

I think it's way past that point with Russia, since you cannot expect to defeat them militarily the same as Germany. The whole world would be burning before Moscow would be occupied. 

&gt;We have to try stop these things before they happen again, and we have to try do it without missiles and tanks and nuclear arms. Sanctions are the first step, but I don't see any problem with NATO putting troops on Russia's doorstep either. If they have no intention of expanding, there shouldn't be any problem.

NATO already has troops on Russian borders. 

Russian attacks are mostly preemptive from their point of view, to stop NATO from expanding.

I just hope that people can see that ""Greece"" isn't just one person, petulantly demanding other subsidize his laziness.

There are plenty of Greeks who worked hard. Yes, their government is corrupt, and has been for a long time. They knew it too. [I too know the pain of having a dysfunctional democracy. It's almost impossible to change.](http://www.upworthy.com/20-years-of-data-reveals-that-congress-doesnt-care-what-you-think) I'm not saying the Greek citizens who voted for their corrupt politicians were completely blameless. I'm just asking that you keep a human perspective.

There are news channels which are blatant propaganda, and the owner of the news also owns the politicians. They promise economic recovery and prosperity for all. They promise to reform the corruption. Of course when they are elected they do none of that. They just give money to the vested interests that own them. The people become more disillusioned with politics.

Then the other party promises reform and socially progressive acts, they promise good jobs, and they get elected, and still nothing changes. They get piecemeal reforms. The vested interests get kickbacks. People get even more disillusioned by politics.

This keeps going back and forth for decades, and nobody has any faith in the political system anymore.

Think of the 21 year old Greek citizen, who hasn't voted in the previous elections. Is he to shoulder the blame for his country's politics for the last few decades? Is he to blame for not figuring out that the government has deliberately falsified the finances to hide the debt that it recklessly incurred?

But now he faces the harsh punishment. His college degree is worthless. Most of his friends and family lost their jobs. There are no jobs to be found. He must live off his grandma's pension, which is now reduced to a very minimal amount. There is no future for him in his home country anymore.

Now people accuse him of being a petulant freeloader, a lazy parasite, who needs to be have some work ethic kicked into his ass. How humane is this? How would you feel?

null,false,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,null,"To be honest, if I'm downhearted about anything, it has been the extent to which people have willingly bought into a variety of simplistic narratives about the crisis, and the damage done by that.

This has been an almost perfect storm for the EU - the first real test it has faced since becoming a more cohesive entity through the Nineties and on, a sudden and dramatic downturn which destroyed trust in government, economy, and finance together, promoted national isolationism, and required that countries already hit by the crisis themselves try to rescue even worse-hit economies in fellow member states. On top of that we've had a situation where the rescue methods that worked in other member states dramatically failed to save one member from an economic implosion.

It's certainly hard to see European unity in any kind of rosy light after the events of the last seven years - but it's not something that *should* be looked at in a rosy light anyway. It's bloody hard work, and always has been. It's worth remembering that while we haven't seen inspiring leadership, we have seen an awful lot of that hard work in action. A very large number of people have laboured long and hard to try to shore up economies, patch up national differences, and not just keep the show on the road through a crisis as large as the Great Depression but actually work constructively to improve things, rather than just throwing in the towel.

And all that has happened in an era of transparency of a level that would have been unthinkable even a couple of decades ago. We know who said what, to whom, when, and we even have it on video to rewatch at our convenience. Chief parties to the ongoing negotiations have blogged the drama as it happens, and listened to the massive roar of noise from social media that was barely a whisper at the start of the crisis. This has been arena democracy, Athenian style, and just as bare-knuckle as that was (with the Greeks nearly getting thrown out of the city). National leaders didn't operate in the comfort of obscurity reported only by sympathetic press, but in the glare of constant, detailed, always critical and often hostile attention. They returned to the job of negotiation, of incremental improvement, time after time, despite huge calls on their attention from domestic politics. Maybe they didn't lead their countries into a rosy new European future, but they did push back against domestic isolationism, did put their money where their mouths were to hold the common currency and the Union together, and in some cases were summarily dismissed for doing so.

I look at that - at the amount of sheer hard work, at the massive involvement in cross-border supra-national debates, at the fact that even the country that has suffered the most wants to stay in both the Union and the common currency, at the fact that virtually nobody objects to the principle of funding crisis countries, but only to the details, at the simple fact that the EU is still there, and I'd say that rather than being downhearted about it, I'm actually somewhat in awe of the sheer will to *be* Europe that has been on display for nearly seven years.

""Incorrect"" is often relative in language. In most English dialects, saying ""me and him"" or 'him and I"", etc, is perfectly fine informally. Only very, very obnoxious people will correct people over this. It is very, very common, I would even say the norm, in most North American dialects. 

Interestingly, I don't think anyone in any dialect would say, ""I and my friend"". I always goes second when there are multiple subjects. 

I have even heard people start to use *reflexive pronouns* in place of subject pronouns e.g. ""The king and myself will go to the castle."". The weird thing is I hear people say things like that in *more* formal situations. 

I think Ihrzen is actually similar to how in English we say ""Her Majesty"". 

It is also technically correct to use the nominative case with copulas like ""to be"", but most dialects of English allow both the objective and nominative. Even saying things like ""Yes, this is she."" or equivalent sounds overly formal to me, just like when English speakers say ""whom"" at all.

So it won't extent the negotiations by much because the agreement is already essentially there 

B) Any extension of the amount of time needed to negotiate this will be balanced out by all the time we save by setting a useful precedent in future negotiations which could happen five, ten, twenty or thirty years from now. We should set the precedent that all EU issues are dealt with by the entire EU, rather than just a certain subset of the EU.

&gt;A European Union investigation **claimed that ""open hostilities"" began with a large-scale Georgian military operation against Tskhinvali**



A report by the OSCE and I quote



&gt;A former senior Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) official, Ryan Grist, who was in charge of unarmed monitors in South Ossetia at war's start,[68] told the BBC in November 2008 that he had been warning of Georgia's military activity before its move into the South Ossetia region, saying there was a ""severe escalation"" and that this ""would give the Russian Federation any excuse it needed in terms of trying to support its own troops.""[69]

&gt;According to Grist, it was Georgia that launched the first military strikes against Tskhinvali.

[Exit polls showed that the reasons they voted no were these:](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/post-vote-poll-1.1268589):

&gt;Don't understand /not familiar 	40%

&gt;Protect Irish identity 	20%

&gt;Don't trust politicians/Govt policies 	17%

&gt;Protect neutrality 	10%

&gt;Keep commissioner 	10%

&gt;Protect tax system 	8%


If you don't trust a single poll, [a *second* poll corroborates this](http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_245_en.pdf):

&gt;Because I do not know enough about the Treaty and would not want to vote for something I am not familiar with 	22%

&gt;To protect Irish identity 	12%

&gt;To safeguard Irish neutrality in security and defence matters 	6%

&gt;I do not trust our politicians 	6%

&gt;We will lose our right to have an Irish Commissioner in every Commission 	6%

&gt;To protect our tax system 	6%

&gt;I am against the idea of a unified Europe 	5%

&gt;To protest against the government's policies 	4%

&gt;To avoid that the EU speaks with one voice on global issues 	4%

&gt;Because large Member States decide on EU matters 	4%

&gt;To protect the influence of small states 	3%

&gt;It would allow the introduction of European legislation in Ireland, such as gay marriage, abortion, euthanasia 	2%

&gt;To avoid an influx of immigrants 	1%

&gt;The EU does not need any fixing, it works fine 	1%

&gt;Other 	14%

&gt;Don't know/not applicable 	3%

These polls show that the majority of people voted ""No"" because they were not informed or didn't understand it. Some raised important issues with the treaty, like regarding taxation and their traditional policy of neutrality, as well as their loss of a guaranteed Commissioner.

With these polls, [Ireland renegotiated the Lisbon treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-eighth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_Bill_2008_(Ireland\)#Second_referendum):

&gt;In the meeting of the European Council (the meeting of the heads of government of all twenty-seven European Union member states) in Brussels on 11–12 December 2008, **Taoiseach Brian Cowen presented the concerns of the Irish people relating to taxation policy, family, social and ethical issues, and Ireland's policy of neutrality**. **Effectively Ireland's position was renegotiated**, and the revised package was approved by the electorate in 2009. Because of the Irish financial crisis it was also apparent that Ireland would need increased financial support from the European Union.

&gt;The European Council agreed that:

&gt;* the necessary legal guarantees would be given that nothing in the Treaty of Lisbon made any change of any kind to the Union's competences on taxation for any member state;

&gt;* the necessary legal guarantees would be given that the Treaty of Lisbon did not prejudice the security and defence policy of any member state, including Ireland's traditional policy of neutrality;

&gt;* the necessary legal guarantees would be given that neither the Treaty of Lisbon (including the Justice and Home Affairs provisions), nor the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, affected the provisions of the Irish Constitution in relation to the right to life, education and the family in any way;

&gt;* in accordance with the necessary legal procedures, a Decision would be taken to retain Ireland's Commissioner, provided that the Treaty of Lisbon was ratified;

&gt;* the high importance attached to issues including workers' rights would be confirmed.

As you can see, most of the complaints were resolved (ignoring the people who simply voted ""No"" because they didn't know what the treaty was about), and people who had previously voted ""No"" voted ""Yes"".",null,1,null,1436842274,null,0,1436842944,0,ct2hywy,null,t3_3d5vm1,null,t1_ct2hywy,null,t1_ct2drm4,null,null,null,1437837045,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

As far as how the resolution of the Greek saga impacts my opinion, there is one big open question: how this €50b in forced EU-overseen privatization will go. Will it be managed in a way that actually benefits Greece, or will it be an asset-stripping fire sale? I am personally skeptical of infrastructure privatization, and I oppose it in Denmark, because I believe that important national infrastructure (energy/water/etc.) belongs to the people, and the government merely manages it on their behalf, but has no right to sell it. I do not like this neoliberal turn towards the idea that Goldman Sachs should own my electric supply, and prefer the classic social-democratic view that we should own our own electric supply.

So I do not like that the EU is pushing infrastructure privatization as a good thing. The IMF is also reportedly skeptical that €50b of assets can be rapidly sold in a way that both captures their value and is devoid of corruption. But it's possible the EU liquidation fund will beat the skeptics. We'll have to wait and see. If it becomes more of a asset-stripping exercise to parcel out Greek national infrastructure to a bunch of foreign megacorps at cheap prices, then my position against the EU will be significantly hardened.

You do understand why small minority of jews indeed lived there Palestinians were overwhelming majority - they somehow have no rights to claim that land because if even one jew lives somewhere that is Israel (?)

&gt; you may have noticed they fled when the surrounding nations tried to exterminate the Israelis.

they did not fled , they were chased away by Israelis and not allowed to return - etchnic cleansing is the term I believe

&gt; what are you calling Palestine?

I am calling Palestine a country within 67th borders (green line) , West Bank and Gaza - You ?

&gt; Jordan, Israel southern Lebanon and Syria?

That is what you called it claiming Palestine is country that encompases everything from British mandate Palestine territory (I helped you in your assertions though)

&gt; how the Fuck can there be 5 mullion refugees? they weren't even 5 million that left. 

People do procreate while in refuge , you do understand that ? And if father was chased away from land and hold claim on that land to return some day - that claim does not die with father - you do understand that 

You will inherit your fathers property/house one day - that house/land does not die with your father - you do understand that or I just gave you a good news (?)

&gt; so they left one part of Palestine (israel) and now their grandchildren are in another part of Israel (jordan) 

So they are internally displaced ? on a serious note did you just claimed that Jordan is Israel also 

&gt; how many other nations do you know that will do that?

do what ? I missed your point here 

&gt; the children and grandchildren of refugees are not refugees themselves 

yes they are , they have a right to their land and they are not allowed to return to their land , so they are refugees , what is so mind boggling here ?

&gt; my point is why do you have a bone about the Jews?

what a swing in conversation (?) based on what did you make this stupid conclusion , you will have to elaborate 

were you going for ""you are anti-semite , because you criticize Israel"" line or something else ? 

&gt; why is it that people that go in about Palestine never care about any other nation on the planet. 

you do understand that we are discussing on Russia-Georgia topic - right? I am here , I am often on other topics discussing other countries too 

I guess question would be , based on what did you came to your conclusion - can you elaborate ?

&gt; are you against nations declaring independence? 

? at this point you are throwing so many stupid lines that I really doubt even you understand what you are going for - but do continue

&gt; Arabs left Israel to facilitate the ethnic cleansing and lost. 

? So let me guess - It is a fault of Arabs that Israel ethnically almost cleansed Israel proper , and that it is still trying to ethnically clean  Occupied territories or Palestine 

&gt; should Britain and France still own the while area or the ottomans? 

why ?

&gt; at what point are the inhabitants allowed to declare independence? 

depends on situation - varies from place to place and from situation to situation - If you are thinking Palestine - as soon as they did , even sooner maybe but they were unable , they were occupied by British and by ottomans before just like they are by Israel nowadays

&gt; and are they not allowed to give shelter to a persecuted religious minority?

Also worth noting that, even in this case, there are more whites than blacks in every state, so there are more white voters than blacks, so whites are setting the agenda.

There are indeed a greater number of poor whites in the country overall, but in the South specifically (which you'll note is where I was talking about), there are still more poor blacks than whites. Break down the numbers by state, don't look at it nationally.

http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0019.pdf

Using these two sources, we can figure out roughly the number of blacks in poverty and whites in poverty for each state.

Take Mississippi. Poverty rate among whites is 13.9% tops, while it's at least 30% for blacks. The population of whites in Mississippi is 1,755,000, and the black population is 1,098,000. That gets us 243,945 white in poverty and 329,400 blacks in poverty. Same story in the other Southern states. Majority of the poor are black, and the whites are much better off.

Recession was unavoidable for Greece. You need to know and acknowledge this.

&gt;In any event, a deep recession was unavoidable. Greece lost market access in the first half of 2010 with a fiscal deficit so large and amortization obligations so onerous that it is difficult to see how a severe economic contraction could have been avoided. Indeed, if Greece had defaulted, the absence of deficit financing would have required primary fiscal balance from the second half of 2010. This would have required an abrupt fiscal consolidation, and led to an evaporation of confidence and huge deposit outflow that would have most likely made the contraction in output even larger.

null,false,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,null,"The reasons it were rejected:

A) hatred for the Liberal Democrats. The leader (Nick Clegg) was seen as the most likeable politician in Britain before the election, largely because he personally seemed very honest and his party could occupy the sensible middle ground. He was that rare thing, a politician people trusted. Then, he went into a formal coalition with the Conservative Party, which is sometimes pejoratively called the ""nasty party"". But the big thing was that the Lib Dems all personally pledged not to raise university tuition fees, and then raised them. So the public was very angry with them, and the voting reform referendum followed very shortly after at the hight of people's anger, and many people saw voting against voting reform as a way of punishing Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems. 

B) Many people who support voting reform, really want proportional representation (like we have in European Union elections), but what we were offered was something called the alternative vote. Now, keep in mind that the Lib Dems support PR, but the Conservatives hate any idea of electoral reform. So the coalition compromise was AV, which nobody wanted. The idea circulated in the pro-PR camp that we should vote against AV, because if we vote overwhelmingly in favour of AV, it will be seen that we want this system specifically, and that will cut of the opportunity for change in the future. And many people maintain this view, but many mainstream politicians take the view that it was not a vote against PR, but was a vote in favour of the current system (and therefore a vote against all electoral reform generally). 

C) The election campaign followed very quickly after the election, with only the small parties supported AV (and not even all the small parties did) which meant that the pro-AV side (essentially just the Lib Dems) had no money to fight the referendum campaign, whilst the Labour (social democratic party) and the Conservative Party had loads of money to spend on fear mongering. There was all sorts of blatant misinformation flying around at the time, which even those who were spreading it have somewhat admitted afterwards that it was blatant misinformation. Add to that the fact nobody really knew about AV before the Coalition (because it was a compromise made from thin air) it made it very easy to spread misinformation on. 

There was voter fraud though. The UK typically does elections very effectively, although the system we use is awful (FPTP). 

So these are the reasons why it failed. the UK public is generally very much in favour of voting reform, especially in the direction of PR, but this referendum was lost for a whole variety of reasons ",null,0,null,1436851694,null,0,false,0,ct2mlnf,null,t3_3d5xun,null,t1_ct2mlnf,null,t1_ct2m1go,null,null,null,1440481294,null,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11,null

I said that the exemptions, vetoes and rebates that the UK had would be ripped up when it came to Scotland and we'd be entering without any concessions to the CAP, CFP etc. 

I said the other EU states would be in an extremely strong negotiating position and Scotland would be in a very weak one, and we would have to make every concession and get a bad deal.

I'm thinking my point is now amply demonstrated.

As for the UK membership. I think we should remain in the EU but I've not been enthusiastic about it. In some ways I think the Greek thing has been enlightening but in other ways it shows how cynical the other EU states are. The EU is no paradise.

I literally don't think there is an example of a trade deal where the UK would have gotten a better deal than the one the EU got. 

Even if there are instances where France and Germany are favoured more than the UK this is weighed out by:

A) ""What goes around, comes around"" Sometimes France and Germany will disproportionately benefit from a trade deal, but so too, sometimes will the UK. And those deals that benefit the UK more, will be many times better than a trade deal it could have negotiated by itself. 

B) Even if one nation gets more out of a specific EU trade deal than another, we all are still benefiting more than we would otherwise. France doing extra good doesn't mean the UK has to do worse. In fact, it means that we're more likely to benefit because if France prospers, so do we due to trade relations.

Broadening the tax base means that they want people that have been exempt from paying taxes, get those exemptions cut and have to pay tax, too.
That is actually something that should appeal to you because it does not mean that current tax payers pay more, it means people that pay no tax or less taxes pay more or at least something. It does put the burden on more shoulders and should in the long run make the preconditions for the decrease of taxes.

I don't know if there is a average property tax in Germany, calculation of the tax is somewhat difficult but what I can tell you is that is surely does not stopp at just 1000 Euro.

&gt; Sustainability of pension system

What you don't seem to get is that it doesn't matter how many hours or years I'm working if I'm not paying anything or not enough in the pension fond before getting my pension out of it. How much money does the average Greek invest in his pension while working? And how much does he get out?  The ratio here has been bent for decades. People didn't pay much in it and got more out of it.
And Germany did raise its pension age to 67 in 2005. At the moment where are in the transition period, but we already introduced that 10 years ago.

If you have a specific bank in mind you can always ask, or I can ask some questions about what is required to open a new account as an American if you don't feel comfortable with phone German :)

As for bank selections, I've personally am satisfied with Haspa as they are all over in Hamburg (branches and ATMs). I've only had some problems traveling trying to put money into the bank as the Sparkasse aren't connected together as one giant bank and are more regional. The other banks are ok, but many are online like the two you listed, and i'm not a giant fan of Commerzbank for reasons listed on the bottom of their Wikipedia article.

Sorry I forgot to mention two things: 

First, Portal sites like [Check24](https://www.check24.de/girokonto/) keep track of ratings and offers for different things like bank accounts.

Second, a *LOT* of things require you to be here first and have your Aufenthaltserlaubnis and/or your Meldebestätigung. Even as a student you can stay up to 3 months on your tourist visa while you work out your other paperwork.

Greece had a massive deficit. Government spending in 2014 was 50% higher than it would've been with a balanced budget in 2009/10 (according to my rough calculations you can find in my history). 

Also, you forget who the Greeks owed money. Greek people and Greek banks, both approximately a quarter each. With no money to bail the latter out (since Athens had to *half* government spending instantly), after the first Greek bank would've gone down, the rest of the domestic financial dominoes would've fallen like a [house of cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfU69_up02Y). Of course, this would've completely shattered the Greek economy with all the money gone, in addition to the massive reduction in government spending. Congratulations, everyone is bankrupt.

Varoufakis seems so keen on stating the bailout for the banks, but he conveniently leaves out which banks needed it the most. Also, as the above will tell you, Greece itself needed saving to, both its banks and its government.

I do not believe in nation states. European integration is a necessity to confront the failures of nation states since the Age of Enlightenment. We'll never get anywhere with them. Today's technology driven opportunities give us a historical momentum to integrate and become a European people, which might eventually lead to one-world-ism faaar out in the future.

The EU has done a lot of good. One day, we will need to federalize. But that day is not today and not in a very long time.

Meanwhile, the euro is a steaming pile of junk and the euro zone a farce dictated from Berlin. The Greek agreement is evidence that I, as a centre-left Dane, would never be heard and would have to take orders from the neoliberals and economic right wingers of Europe. What has happened goes directly against the Nordic way of solving problems. That is my impression. There is absolutely no way I can trust a group of politicians who think that a problem that becomes *much* worse by applying austerity can be solved by *applying more of the same*. This is irrational and has nothing to do with ""securities"" as everyone knows Greece can't pay anything back, ever. Alternatives do exist, but the EZ circle jerk just can't get over itself or find time to read a book.

I just bought a car, even though it's imported and I negotiated the EUR price, at the end we convert the price to RON and I pay in RON. When you take a home mortgage, it's often in EUR (better interest rate) - but the bank will just convert all the money to RON when it gives you the credit. I'm pretty sure all this is required by law, and not just useless conversion imposed by the private companies.

What the bank actually tries to see is whether your salary is denominated in a different currency than your loan, to asses currency risk - but that's a different issue.

Alabama doesn't need its own currency because the federal government borrows for all of the essentials on its behalf. The state only needs to borrow for non-essential expenditure and the US also has very strong legal procedures for when a state is too heavily indebted.

In the US, if a state defaults on its bonds it goes to a court and most of the debt gets written off depending on the financial status of the state. If the creditors don't like it they get told to fuck off. The federal government doesn't spend months negotiating to try to please the creditors. The creditors made a gamble, they lose, they go home and lend to another state instead. 

These are things that the eurozone needs to sort its own crap out. Why isn't Greece able to file for bankruptcy in a safe, legal way like a US state is? Why is there no fiscal transfers to subsidise the periphery states?

null,false,ProCandleLighter,FRAN,France,null,"this is one of the many reasons behind the republic revolution but not the main one. France bankrupted itself because it was badly mismanaged by the corrupt nobility.

The main reason is that europe was transitoning to the modern era, with the bourgeoisie, a word which means bourg (city) inhabitants, the cities middle to upper classes who didn't have nobility and were responsible for a growing part of the country wealth and yet didn't enjoy any power compensation. 

The absolute monarchism was seen as obsolete and many were eyeing what the british were doing with their parliament. In that sense, the way people could start voting in 1791 is very telling =&gt; only active citizens paying ""le cens"", a tax worth three days of work could vote. And not directly to elect the representatives themselves, only electing the second degree electors who have a higher revenue requirements than the first degree electors. This was those electors that elected representatives and in turn, it was supposed to balance things in favor of the bourgeoisi and aristocrats.

So the revolution was initially just a move to rebalance the power at the benefit of the bourgeoisie, not turning the whole thing upside down.

Good thing or bad thing, it became out of control. The reason is that at the same time, great french intellectuals like Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu and others were spreading the ideas of human right who culminated in the declarations of the right of man and citizen. And the idea of equality, especially, was *not* something the bourgeoisie wanted.

With many populist figures stirring up things, and the agression from european neighbouring countries that did a lot to unify the nation, there was a wind of revolutionary fervor and the whole thing spun out of control with the terror.

null,false,LordGravewish,PORT,Portugal,null,"First things first, 6% is a huge surplus. Running a surplus of 6% instead of 8% is very different from ""borrowing and spending mindlessly"", let's not kid ourselves.

The reason for that rule is that if you have a surplus, someone must be having a deficit - it's basic mathematics. This means that one country having a surplus (especially a very large country that exports a lot) usually results in other countries going into debt to pay for that deficit. This means that a country with a surplus is indirectly *hurting other countries*.

Therefore, strong economies in an economic union should be required to keep it below a certain surplus (and invest the rest back into the economy, increasing consumption and imports, which help to stabilize the situation and return money to the other, weaker economies - also, it increases the quality of living in the ""surplus country"", so it's win/win), in order for other countries (especially weaker countries) to not suffer because of that.

Now, to be fair, a lot of Germany's surplus supposedly comes from outside the EU, so it's not necessarily that harmful for the remaining member states. Still, it has an effect, and rules are rules... But it seems Germany doesn't have to follow all the rules, when it doesn't feel like it.

I agree that most of the blame for the current crisis lies with Greece, Portugal, Ireland, etc, for their mismanagement and over-borrowing policies of the last decade, and that it'd be unfair to institute anything even close to a transfers union to keep those countries propped up, without any kind of fiscal and/or political union.

But let's not kid ourselves, Germany's surplus didn't help much either. Rules usually exist for a reason, and it's a bit hypocritical for a country to keep complaining that others don't follow the rules (even if they're right) while ignoring one rule entirely (because it doesn't affect them negatively).",null,0,null,1436859696,null,0,1436859890,0,ct2pa3q,null,t3_3d7g9g,null,t1_ct2pa3q,null,t1_ct2o1wp,null,null,null,1437840589,null,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7,null

null,false,ravingraven,GREE,Greek working in Germany,null,"&gt;Broadening the tax base means that they want people that have been exempt from paying taxes, get those exemptions cut and have to pay tax, too.

That is completely false. If you made the effort to read my comment you would see that broadening the tax base means raising the VAT (which impacts pretty much only the poor), the property tax (in Greece there are not many big property holders, so yet again the impacts the average Greek) etc.

A higher tax for companies that make more than half a million euro in revenue was proposed from our government but it was **shot down** by the troika.

&gt;I don't know if there is a average property tax in Germany, calculation of the tax is somewhat difficult but what I can tell you is that is surely does not stopp at just 1000 Euro.

I never told you that it stops at 1000 Euro in Greece either. That is just what the average Greek has to pay more or less. From personal experience (I pay property tax here in Germany and my parents in Greece) I can tell you that the tax is a lot higher in Greece, especially if you factor in that the average wage in Germany (and the average property cost) is double that of Greece.

&gt;What you don't seem to get is that it doesn't matter how many hours or years I'm working if I'm not paying anything or not enough in the pension fond before getting my pension out of it.

Greek pensioners have paid more than enough to fill up the pension funds. The unsustainability was created **during** the crisis when pension funds were slashed to service the debt and  bail out the banks (PSI).

&gt;How much money does the average Greek invest in his pension while working? And how much does he get out? The ratio here has been bent for decades.

That is simply not true. Those numbers have not changed significantly the last 50 years and the pension system has been working just fine. What changed is the number of people actually working (unemployment is tremendously high) and the drop in GDP.

&gt;And Germany did raise its pension age to 67 in 2005. At the moment where are in the transition period, but we already introduced that 10 years ago.

The average Greek retires at about the same time as the German one. 45% of Greek pensioners get paid below the poverty line. How big is that number in Germany?

&gt;If your banks don't work, they have to be reformed. 

If banks don't work they have to go bankrupt. Banks are private. Why should I care about them being reformed or not. What actually happened though is that European taxpayers (Greeks via the PSI and Germans etc. via the bailout package of 2010) bailed out those banks.

As of this point, the euro-friendly opposition parties(106 MPs in total) have made it clear that they will support Tsipras regardless of if he forms a Syriza-only government or a technocrat government. In the case of a national unity government, New Democracy has - as of this point - said that they will not directly participate in such a formation but they will nonetheless support such a government. PASOK and Potami seem to follow the same tune. 

They have also made it clear that they will not submit a motion of no-confidence against both the government and the Parliament's Speaker (whom has oppenly rebelled against Tsipras; this is also not an option because the Parliament ceases all actions for three days in this case while measures need to be voted until Wednesday). 

The leader of Tsipras' coalition partner (ANEL) has already stated that he will vote no but, in his own insanity, stated that he will support the government.

TL;DR: Elections will not happen until everything stabilizes. As of this moment, this date appears to be around October or so. However, there is no real limitation on the duration of a ""unity government"" other than the planned 4-year election cycle.

The non-EZ members' contribution would add up to about €1.9bn in guarantees, about 2% of this round, or half a percent of the total so far.

That's just not enough for the potential headaches that come with having more parties involved. Just look at yours and GP's comments. Representation in the ECB? Representation in Eurozone summits? Generally, having Cameron and the British tabloids involved? I'm sorry, but that's just not worth it.

The bridge financing absolutely must be agreed on by Sunday, because Greece must pay a tranche of ECB loans on Monday and it would be legally very difficult for the ECB to keep up ELA if that payment is not made. This will be followed by detailed negotiations that will be extremely difficult, and banks won't be able to operate properly (or as much as they could while capital controls are in force, which they will be for the foreseeable future) until they receive some €25bn in funding, which requires a deal. Greece economy will rapidly deteriorate until that happens, and tourists will stay away. A week more or less makes a huge difference here.

It's simple. The current situation is a result of more than a century of Republican propaganda. Today however I'd say most people are aware that most revolutionaries were either deluded, power-hungry scum or masses of common folk who were unable to feed their children.

For the sake of brevity, the terror and Jacobin ideas nevertheless had a huge impact on the exercise of power in France. That's why even today the ideas of centralisation and egalitarianism have such an influence in France.

I totally understand your point of view as there's a world of difference between the English Glorious Revolution or the American Revolution on the one hand and the advent of the French democratic State on the other hand.

I think our need for categorizing is somewhat the reason for the weird state our commedy culture is in. The fact that you are either a commedian or a 'Kabarettist' (the mentioned high-brow political satire) sort of furthers the clownishness of our 'normal' comedy. The artists usually come to a point where they decide if they want to be a more serious, political Kabarettist or if they'd rather go another direction, for the lulz and giggles so to speak. When you decide to be in one pidgeonhole, you sort of define yourself by not being in the other one. Which (mostly) leads to there being no real middle ground between the clownish and the serious commedy.
IMHO that's quite a shame as clownish comedy usually gets old real fast but Kabarett can be somewhat challenging if you just want to watch something funny to relax.

Arguing with Twitter hashtags is like urinating into a hurricane, and a particularly stupid and self-righteous hurricane at that. But sometimes, you just have to do these things anway, and dry yourself off afterwards. So here goes: no, this is not a coup. 

\#thisisacoup has been trending in various parts of the world for several hours over the latest Greek talks. Let’s skim over the awkward fact that Twitter and public opinion are not the same thing and deal with the argument – such as it is – that lies beneath the hysteria and hyperbole. A coup is what happens when a group of people, foreign or domestic, seize power in a country by force or coercion. I’ll allow a bit of poetic licence in political conversation about Greece, so I won’t bother with the literalist argument that it’s not a coup because there are no tanks or guns or men in uniforms involved. 

Instead, the argument seems to boil down to suggesting that because the Greek government is about to sign up to policies advocated by foreign governments and international organisations, Greek democracy has been thwarted. After all, the Greek people voted against something like the proposed deal in a referendum last week. Isn’t it undemocratic for that view not to prevail here? 

Here’s a quick Politics 101 lesson for the #thisisacoup mob: Greece is not a direct democracy. It is a representative one. That means that the Greek people elect their governments to make decisions on their behalf. Referendums are not binding in Greece; they simply advise the government of the day on the views of the people. (That’s set out in the Greek constitution, a set of rules put in place by elected Greek politicians in 1975 after the country, er, got rid of its military rulers.) 

To repeat: the Greek people elect their governments. Those governments do things, things like spending, taxing and borrowing. If the Greek people don’t like those things, they can sack their government and get another one. The things that Greek governments do, things like spending, taxing and borrowing, have consequences. One of those consequences is that Greece has run out of money and needs to get more money from someone else. Hence the negotiations in Brussels, where the people who will provide that money are asking for conditions before giving them that money. 

Are those conditions extreme, draconian and potentially counterproductive? Quite possibly, yes. Is Greece under enormous pressure to accept them, and facing horrible consequences if it says no? Oh yes: the pressure is vast, the consequences truly terrible. And are the negotiations slanted against Greece, because Germany has more money and political clout within the EU than Greece? Yes. But so what? Germany is a bigger, richer country than Greece. That’s just a fact of life. Welcome to the real world, kids. 

And while we’re on the subject of Germany, can I just suggest that the “voice of the people” argument cuts both ways here. Angela Merkel and her government are answerable to the German people, whose taxes are on the line in this deal. The Chancellor is doing the job she holds in the German democractic system, and she’ll be held accountable for her actions by German politicians and voters through that system. 

Very few of the #thisisacoup crowd seem to be worried that the sovereign will of the German people is being ignored in the Greek talks, even though it almost certainly is: a referendum in Germany would very likely see German voters seeking even tougher conditions on Greece, or immediate expulsion from the Eurozone. When the pious hashtag brigade care as much for the Germans’ popular sovereignty as they do for the Greeks’, they’ll be worth listening to. 

Instead, they seem to prefer childish and nasty references to the Second World War. On this point, I’d like to briefly set aside any pretence of courtesy or respect of the views of others and say this: if you compare the actions of the democratic German government led by Angela Merkel to those of Nazi Germany, you are not just an idiot but a hateful, small-minded and bigoted idiot. 

Yes, Greece is under a lot of pressure to accept another bailout, and some of the conditions being attached to that bailout are stupidly harsh. But that is not the same thing as Greece being compelled by force to accept. If the Greek people do not like the deal that their current government is about to accept, they can sack that government and get another one, one that might chose to withdraw from the deal and pursue other policies, policies which would have consequences of their own. 

This is not a coup. Anyone who thinks it is should grow up and join the real world.

null,false,Omegastar19,null,null,null,"I think the revolution's primary cause was the nobility. The nobility were practically holding a large amount of the Nation's wealth without doing anything with it, and they were adding nothing to the economy. And most of all, they paid no taxes and held held all kinds of privileges that actually cost the state tons of money. Basically everyone knew this in the late 18th century, but the nobility stubbornly sabotaged every single attempt by the King and his ministers to change the situation into a fairer one.  
 
The French Revolution was actually preceded by a rebellion by the nobility when the King made a final, extreme effort to change things. This noble rebellion was the thing that brought the French state to its knees, almost like the situation Greece is currently in. There simply was not enough money anymore. So the King relented and, at the instigation of the nobility, he called for the Estates-General.  
  
The reason the nobility wanted this to happen is because the Estates-General was still based on the medieval class-representation of Clergy, Nobility and the rest. In this Estates-General, each class had the same amount of representatives, and voted seperately in seperate buildings. And as has been the case practically always, the Clergy themselves were partially nobility, and practically all of the higher Clergy (Bishops and Abbots) were all members of noble families. Which meant the Nobility could basically count on a 2/3 majority in the Estates General.   
  
So what the Nobility was doing was in effect a Coup d'état. The Nobility actually indicated that they were willing to start paying taxes. But in return they wanted practical control over the state. The King would become a figurehead, the aristocracy would have all the power and the rest of the population got nothing.  
  
The problem was that the nobility did not realize that the practical balance of power had long since shifted away from them. They owned a considerable proportion of the land in France, and a considerable proportion of the wealth, but none of this was obtained through modern economical activities. As you said, the people in the cities were becoming more and more the ones who contributed to the economic growth in France. But they held almost no power in the political system of France. So when the French nobility then attempted to reduce that little bit of power they had even further while their respective economic positions had long since shifted in favor of the bourgeoisie....that was so absurd, so completely out of touch with reality, that it set off the French Revolution.",null,0,null,1436864005,null,0,false,0,ct2qeas,null,t3_3d78h8,null,t1_ct2qeas,null,t1_ct2p09d,null,null,null,1437840939,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

People have forgotten what a force for democracy the European Project has been.  41 years ago Portugal was under an authoritarian government installed by a coup. 41 years ago Greece was under a military junta installed by a coup. 40 years ago Spain was under a dictator, and 37 years ago Spain was about to face three coup attempts in four years. 32 years ago Poland was under a military junta installed by a coup. 26 years ago Romania was ruled by a totalitarian dictator.

null,false,ZeroJanvier,FRAN,Vive la République !,null,"It's complicated. The French President doesn't legally have that much more power than his European ceremonial counterparts. It's just that by tradition, when the Prime minister is of the same party, he submits to the President, follows his orders, lets him set the agenda and take the big decisions. The Prime minister is usually just that, the first of the ministers, checking the other ministers and enforcing the President's decisions.


On the contrary, when the Parliament is of a different party it can impose its leader as PM, and that one obviously doesn't submit to the President, so the system works as in other European countries, which is certainly better. However since 2002 the situation is almost impossible because Parliament is elected just right after the President, and for the same term, so they would normally have the same party. 


There's still the possibility of a strong and active PM serving a weak and reserved President, as it is the case with Valls and Hollande. In that case the President can lose much of his control over policy. But even then the President can always just dismiss him if there's a conflict between them (that's what happened to Chaban-Delmas and to Roccard, both were of their President's party but were fired because they acted too independently and were becoming too popular).",null,0,null,1436864352,null,0,false,0,ct2qh99,null,t3_3d60af,null,t1_ct2qh99,null,t1_ct2oulp,null,null,null,1437840967,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

J'préviens tu sors de là avec un kilo de viande, donc t'as intérêt à en bouffer, mais c'est pas vraiment un problème vu comment c'est bon.

C'est aussi une recette qui demande beaucoup de temps (4/5h minimum) quoi qu'on puisse faire autre chose en même temps, et surtout beaucoup d'amour.

Comme musique d'ambiance, plusieurs écoles, mais moi j'aime bien Adriano Celentano.

C'est pas compliqué, t'achètes:  
-500g de chair à saucisse de porc NATURE  
-500g de viande de boeuf hachée (le % de MG est pas hyper important)  
-⅔ carottes moyennes  
-un oignon de taille moyenne  
-laurier  
-400g (à sec) de tomates pelées Mutti (des Pelato quoi. On peut aussi prendre des vrais tomates et les peler, mais je le recommande que si l'on a accès à des tomates qui ont vraiment beaucoup de goût).  
-concentré de tomate (pas besoin de beaucoup)  
-des pâtes (Penne Rigate, Mafalde Corte…)  
-de l'huile d'olive  
-une bouteille de vin rouge qui a vu un peu de soleil.


Pour commencer, tu coupes les carottes et l'oignon en tout petit bout: le plus petit sera le mieux. Tu mets à cuire dans une casserole avec de l'huile, à feu relativement doux: il ne faut pas que ça brûle.  
En attendant que les légumes cuisent (20 bonnes minutes), tu vas prendre la viande et la malaxer ensemble pour qu'on ne fasse plus la différence entre le porc et le boeuf.  
Quand les légumes sont bien cuits, tu mets la viande mélangée dans la casserole et tu recouvres allègrement d'eau. Personnellement je mets quasiment un litre. Tu fais cuire toujours à feu doux, il faut que l'eau s'évapore doucement.

C'est cette étape là qui est très très longue: il faut revenir régulièrement surveiller que la viande n'accroche pas, donc remuer. Ça permet aussi de répandre les bonnes odeurs dans toutes la maison, ça c'est important.  
Au bout d'un moment il n'y aura quasiment plus d'eau (faire gaffe à ne pas faire brûler, toujours). Ça peut prendre bien 1h30 à 2h. à ce moment mettre l'équivalent d'un bon verre de vin dans la casserole. Et remuer/laisser s'évaporer. Ça doit commencer à sentir bon.  
Pendant ce temps là tu sors ta boîte de tomate et tu attends.

Après une vingtaine de minute, le vin doit d'être évaporé et la consistence de la viande aura changé un peu: ça doit être plus morcelé, en théorie. C'est à ce moment là, quand il n'y a plus d'eau ni de vin, qu'on verse les tomates pelées et une cuillère à café de concentré de tomate. On remue bien, et on laisse cuire à feu doux. En général à ce moment là je mets un couvercle.

Et là on attend encore une bonne heure en remuant (ou plus, on peut attendre à peu près aussi longtemps qu'on veut). Le ragù doit prendre une teinte orangée, et ça doit sentir bon dans toute la maison. C'est à la fin de cette heure qu'on mettra sel et poivre.

Au bout d'un moment tu devrais avoir vraiment faim d'avoir surveillé ce bazar pendant une demi-journée. Alors tu prends une autre casserole, tu mets de l'eau, tu attends que ça bout, tu mets tes pâtes, et tu les sors quand elles sont Al Dente, s'il te plait. On ne rigole pas avec les pâtes.

Ensuite, tu mets tes pâtes dans une assiette, tu mets du ragù sur tes pâtes, et ensuite tu manges tes pâtes. Et après tu refais des pâtes parce qu'en fait c'est beaucoup trop bon et tu ne peux plus t'arrêter.

null,false,littlepwny,null,null,null,"&gt; Konstantopoulou is strongly opposing the deal, so it would seem that the government wants her resignation, while she seems to be unwilling to go without a fight. She is expected to create some obstacles in tomorrow's voting (same as she did last Friday before the weekend's negotiations).

Some further background on this, Konstantopoulou had locked herself in her office to stop the session on the ""support us vote"" from happening on Friday. She had initially planned to have the talks start at 06:00 on Saturday (Eurogroup started at 10:00) which would have destroyed the whole thing. In the end, Tsipras convinced her to have the session start at midnight with the voting at 03:00. She also essentially challenged Tsipras and repeated that her committe had found the debt to be illegal. 

In the end, Tsakalotos ended up going to the Eurogroup extremely tired.

&gt; She may be censured by other members of Syriza. An opposition member directly asked for her resignation. Another Syriza member describes her as arrogant and condescending.

The opposition leaders said that they will not issue a motion of censure against her unless the Prime Minister begins such a procedure. [Similarly, they will not issue a motion of censure against the Government even if the government loses majority]

Additionally, such a motion cannot be submitted as of this moment because - when a motion against the Speaker is issued - the parliament closes for 3 days until a new Speaker is elected. 

The parliament needs to act very swiftly but it is very likely that Konstantopoulou will do her best to make the situation as excruciating as possible. 

--- 

For those not in the know, this behaviour has been a regular occurence since her first day as a Speaker where she started using her position for the own benefit rather than the benefit of the Parliament.

This is such an important result, and it comes just over a year after the LHCb experiment confirmed the existence of a [four-quark resonance](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1903).

Three previous pentaquark candidates (Θ(1540), Φ(1860), and Θc(3100)) have come and gone before, but none of them were above 5σ significance, nor were their resonant phase motions measured. The pentaquark candidates in this new LHCb result have a combined significance of 15σ, and the narrower state shows very good phase motion, which is really strong evidence that it's a proper resonance and not some background effect.

Oh, he is -- far bigger in Germany than he ever was in his native Britain.

&gt; There are also so many US/British Comedians who are clowns(Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, highest earning US-Comedy guys) and german comedians who are wise cracks

God, I always get this one. That's why I was so careful to make it **VERY CLEAR INDEED** that I was talking in general terms, and that there are always exceptions, and *still* you point out the exceptions as if they disprove the general point.

&gt; I think humour is very much a personal taste and most certainly not dependent on the country you are born in. 

No, this is demonstrably false. British sitcoms have to be remade for American TV and remade for German TV, American sitcoms are shown in Britain and Germany but in both countries are regarded as cheap and trashy, while Brits and Americans alike find German comedy almost impossible to appreciate.

I don't understand why so many Germans get so upset about this. Humour is not universal: it is a part of culture, and different parts of the world have different cultures, it's as simple as that. What's funny in one culture is not funny in another, and there are different expectations. Even when different cultures watch the same comedy they interpret it differently: Germans like Monty Python for the slapstick, older Brits like Monty Python for the way it satirizes Britain in the 1970s, and younger Brits and Americans like Monty Python for the surrealism and the catchphrases.

it's just how we are as humans.

Der Genderismus versucht ja eben den etablierten wissenschaftlichen Konsens mit **seiner** Theorie zu widerlegen. Dazu bedient er sich aber nicht wissenschaftlicher Methoden.

The haircut has partially already happened, but we just pretend it didn't for political purposes. 

""In the Munich conference which was hosted by Germany’s IFO institute, the driving force was US investor Paul Kazarian, who is believed to be the largest holder of Greek government bonds. In front of an audience of economists, accounting experts and lawyers, Kazarian argued passionately for his idea: if you valued Greek debt on a market value or accrual basis, all the relief measures taken since 2010 would add up to a €200 billion haircut. If you then subtracted Greece’s net financial assets of €90 billion from that (this is a Eurostat 2013 figure) then you get to a net debt position of €33 billion, or 18 per cent of GDP.

Although economists at the conference quibbled about some of the numbers (the assets for example), the point is that when compared with the equivalent numbers for Ireland, Portugal or Spain, this looks like a far from unsustainable burden. It doesn’t require any new debt relief programme, but merely a recognition in accounting terms of what has already taken place. Kazarian may have some heavyweight accountants backing his numbers, but the political realities left him sounding exasperated.

On one hand, the Eurogroup, led by Germany’s finance minister, refuses to budge from the official €315 billion figure, because it doesn’t want to acknowledge the transfer that has already taken place. On the other hand, it suits Greece’s Syriza government to say it owes €315 billion because it sounds crippling and gives more negotiating leverage.""",null,0,null,1436865838,null,0,false,0,ct2qu97,null,t3_3d6op2,null,t1_ct2qu97,null,t1_ct2pn6s,null,null,null,1440480836,null,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7,null

The real travesty here is that you expect Greeks to have western salaries at the expense of other countries.

Greeks will have €3000 per month when their economy can sustain that, not when other countries (some of them poorer) are forced into carrying their asses. Being an import-based economy they're consuming the products of European labor by choice. This pushes money outside the country. 

Let's say I'm designing cars in Germany and paying my engineers €3000, resulting in my product costing €25.000 on the Greek market. Greeks get the choice to sustain my economy (with those salaries) by paying that price. They can build their own, but they'll have to offer a better product.
You don't get to complain about being underpaid when you chose the former. Any attempt to do so sounds like ""waa, it's unfair, I want a BMW and I want it cheaper"" to me at least.

In other words: if you like the product of my labor, but I don't like yours, I will make more money than you. You're giving me that money yourself.

&gt; Why do Germans deserve salaries of €2000+ when the average Bosnian has to live on a fifth of that

When a bunch of Bosnian engineers start making cars which millions of Europeans are willing to pay tens of thousands of euros for, Bosnian salaries will reach German levels. It's just one example where German economy blooms.

When your industry has to be set up by foreign specialists with foreign funds and your job is to mass-produce someone else's design you can't expect to be paid the same as the specialists who made the whole operation possible. You're easily replaceable, they're not.

When you vote corrupted demagogs to rule your country and manage the funds of your country you can't expect that money to be managed as well as in countries which vote responsibly.

When you don't pay your taxes you can't expect others to cover for you, providing funds for infrastructure, welfare and pensions.

Well, you have to ask the corollary: what would happen should the EU/US divorce itself from Iran, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc?


So we disentangle ourselves, reject their government, and stop using oil. Now what? Now we have numerous radical, well-armed, and destabilized countries in an already tumultuous region wherein further, or total, destabilization could lead to nuclear war (think: India-Pakistan).

Like it or not but we can't just cut off ties, and we can't just get off oil. This issue is long-term and has no easy answers. I'm no consequentialist, but you don't have to be to recognize the disaster that a fully destabilized middle-east would wrought. We have no choice but to work with vile people sometimes.

null,false,marsman,NORN,Northern Ireland,null,"&gt;I am talking about the wider issue of the UK refusal to show solidarity for an EU member state.

The UK supported Greece through the various mechanisms available to it, Greece didn't ask the UK for help directly and frankly it got fucked hard enough by the Troika to make the question of exactly who was showing solidarity fairly pertinent..

But I digress, what solidarity was the UK supposed to show? How could it have shown it? The UK doesn't hold very much Greek debt, it is not a Eurozone member and the IMF already provided support.. Or is the UK now required to carry out some sort of unilateral action too?

The issue here isn't one of solidarity, it isn't about a hysterical media either, it is about arrogant, self aggrandising and frankly ego-driven absurdity from select individuals within EU institutions. I mean seriously, the last few weeks have done more harm to the credibility and image of the EU than anything else I can think of, and why? What benefit did we see?

And there has been several of them since 2008, not just for Greece but Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus for example. These are in addition to being a net contributor for several years. The four largest net contributors to EU budget as a proportion of GDP are Denmark, Italy, Germany, Finland (wikipedia). And Finland for example is part of European Stability Mechanism, even though we do not have any financial interests to be secured in southern countries, because we have no big international banks operating in that area. We can argue this is a case of keeping EZ together without underlying financial interests. There was opposition here to join the mechanism, but we still joined it.

But you have to understand, all these problems and bailouts are exhausting for the people. All they hear in the news is that again and again we are contributing money, but the benefits of being part of EU and Euro rarely make any news. It is seven years since the beginning of the crisis and economies, ours included, are still performing weakly.

I agree with you that humour has a big cultural influence, that point of mine was false. I think it gets lesser, as cultures get less insular in the modern world though.

I would also agree that large part of the german comedic world are clowns, but I still think that you dismiss the other examples too quickly. You have lived here for 25 years. Then you must have realized how big Schmidt was in his prime. 
And I think you also realize how big Sandler and Stiller were and still are in America. Also think of all their tv-shows(Big Bang Theory, Fresh Prince of Bel-Air). They all have a low-brow type of humour.

I think the clown observation is more dependent on the educational status of the viewer than on the country he belongs too.
These Mario Barth/Sandler/stiller gags just fly with a certain crowd of people. These people go on vacations in Magaluv, drink a lot of beer when they come home from work they want to be passively entertained instead of doing any thinking. I'd argue that these people exist in Great Britain too.

null,false,Dr_Gage,null,null,null,"Overall I view it as negative, but I do concede that it has a few good points.

The bad: 

* Not a true democracy when your head of state is a non elected and chosen by birth right (plus not allowing women to be queen). 
* Coruption I, things like the businessmen association gifting a huge boat smells fishy and is totally inappropriate in my opinion.
* Corruption II, the previous king has been found to have private business with others heads of state and using his influence to make money. 
* Corruption III, the exptended family uses the connections to make money, Urdangarin was running a scam for years, the king knew and did nothing, one of his daughters works for an insurance company and obviously uses her name and rank as leverage for doing business. Until recently they were also getting paid by the state just for existing. 
* Expensive, people say that a president of the republic would be cheaper, but so would a dictator. I'd much rather spend a little more and have an elected head of state. 
* Above the law, Yo can't judge the king or the immediate family, [The Mongolia magazine made a great cover](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BDWA1SjCAAEXA8j.jpg:large), a little exaggerated but sums it up pretty good. (translation: the king could rape you and because the article 56. 3 of the constitution declares him unjudgable, he could also rob an old lady's purse, pee on the street, steel a book in the corte ingles...)

* Putting all the diplomatic eggs in the same basket, with some countries there is more of a personal relationship (see morocco and the previous king and our previous king relationship, they called each other brothers). This makes his position too strong for my taste as he could use personal relationships for both profit and political lever. I'd rather have a bureaucrat with a retirement date handle this affairs. 
* Plain and simple shame. Everyone knew the previous king is a drunken ""putero"" (visits prostitutes), had affairs, has a long time mistress, has been caught using public resources for private enjoyment...for example this famous woman that said she had photos of the king demonstrating they had an affair was suddenly robbed in her house an the photos diapered. It's just the life style you would expect from someone that has had all by birth, fells and is immune to law and just knows he can get away with anything. 

The good:

* Having a head of state that has been educated, groomed and has been to the three branches of the armed forces is positive, there is literally no one with a better resume for the job.
* Some of their personal relationships have ended in business for Spanish corporations, This is the good in the bad as it's profiting from a corrupt system. 
* Some people, specially older generations, feel it gives a stability to the system, as there is someone outside and on the top of the rest the political system. Also being the head of the military makes him be looked as last resort shield.


In conclusion, I think that the negative aspects greatly surpass the positive. My solution would be to do a referendum (once, and accept the results for at least one generation, 15-25 years) and let the people decide. I'd say it would be a close call. But I much rather have a full democratic approach to the problem.

null,false,watabadidea,null,null,null,"&gt;While I agree that Varoufakis is not politically correct (and perhaps not a true politician either) and I also agree that he has an excellent knowledge in Greek and English alike, he is still likely to have used the term with its old meaning. 

I think it goes beyond simply not being politically correct though and into an area of actively looking to poke and irritate his opposition.

For instance, he self-titled one of his major discussions on the crises after *A Modest Proposal*.  The original *A Modest Proposal* offered no actual solutions and was mainly a vehicle to highlight the moral and the ethical bankruptcy of those the author felt were responsible for the economic crises in Ireland, at the time.

As an academic, V. knows exactly what that essay is about.  To self-title his piece after it tells me that his actions go beyond being simply politically incorrect.

&gt;This is not unusual with academics: there is a lot of debate around terminology and many conservative professors pay a lot of attention to language and try to influence the evolution of semantics. Perhaps Varoufakis did something like this, expand the notion of terrorism beyond the US Pentagon limits like it used to be in the past and like it most likely will be in the future.

A few points.

First, this seems like a reach in that the forum and situation seem so totally wrong for this type of debate/discussion on semantics that I have a hard time believing that this was actually the goal.

Second, even if we assume that this was what he was doing, it begins to call into question if we can really believe anything he says at face value.  I mean, if he is openly saying things that he *knows* will be interpreted one way, but means something substantially different in an effort to push the bounds of semantics, I think we need to stop taking pretty much *anything* he says at face value.  I don't see this happening from his defenders.  It seems they pick and choose between a strict interpretation and a ""pushing the bounds"" interpretation based on convenience. 

Finally, does this really seem like the most likely situation?  I mean, do you think that, based on the stakes involved and how clearly it is that it wouldn't go over well, that he picked this time to try to have the debate?  

Isn't it more likely that he said it to score political points at home and he knew that he had an excuse that would fly with his supporters and that he enjoys fucking with the people that don't support him?  Everything I've seen out of him suggests this is much more probable.

&gt;People in international talks have to be cautious when interpreting words originating from a different culture.

They also have to be careful when *choosing* words.

How that responsibility is split depends on a number of factors.  I think the fact that he has a Western European education and that he was speaking to a Western European audience puts much more of the responsibility on him in this case.

This week they were going to have a vote on lifting restrictions on Fox Hunting despite the fact it's not supported by most of the population and it's one of the first acts of the new parliament. They work in mysterious ways, but their attitude to Europe is frankly weird.

I don't dismiss them at all. They're just not relevant to the point I'm trying to make.

&gt; you must have realized how big Schmidt was in his prime

But he's an exception, that's the point. And even in his prime, sparring with Herbert Feuerstein on *Schmidteinander*, I found his comedy more German than British.

&gt; (Big Bang Theory, Fresh Prince of Bel-Air). They all have a low-brow type of humour.

OK, I didn't use ""low-brow"" to describe any humour. But those shows are actually perfect illustrations of my point: the heroes in those shows are caricatured wisecracks, not clowns.

&gt; I think the clown observation is more dependent on the educational status of the viewer

Not in my experience, no.

&gt; they want to be passively entertained instead of doing any thinking. I'd argue that these people exist in Great Britain too.

The British ones don't tend to go for Mr Bean; they are usually more drawn to people like Michael McIntyre, who does straightforward observational stand-up. His critics complain that he is bland, safe, even boring, but never clownish or slapstick. He is, though, Britain's most successful stand-up comic.

&gt; You still have not shown how Mr. Bean is more popular in Germany than in Great Britain.

For example, the latest *Mr Bean* movie made twice as much money in Germany as it did in any other European country, including Britain. I've been looking for viewing and sales figures, but I can't seem to find any; but Germans' love of Mr Bean is one of the things that British travellers to Germany regularly remark upon.

&gt; Saying that challenging your point is enforcing a stereotype

No, doing so so vehemently is the stereotype. It's the stereotype of the German who reacts to anything new or challenging with anger. You call my point ""shitty"", insist (quite rudely, if I may say so) that I deliberately neglected to mention a range of facts that have little or no relevance to my point, and accused me of disingenuity by ""dismissing"" exceptions as exceptions.",null,0,null,1436869855,null,0,false,0,ct2rt5r,null,t3_3d4vxz,null,t1_ct2rt5r,null,t1_ct2rbkp,null,null,null,1437841253,null,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1,null

Yeah well, it isn't that easy. Greece has a shrinking GDP, a rather large budget deficite and a debt to GPD ratio of 174%. All this looks like it will get worse, not better. So which sane creditor would give them a cheap loan and ignore the risk? The answer is: only someone who also hedges against the risk by betting on Greece's default, or someone with a political (ideological) reason to keep them afloat would be willing to do that. And both will fuck Greece over.

To get out of this scenario they would have to somehow find a way to stop the GDP from shrinking and at the same time fix the budget deficit issue. They could only get access to loans from less dangerous creditors if they found a way to get back to positive GDP growth and budget surplusses, which in turn would reduce the debt to GDP ratio.

+ Nichts erlebt,
+ nichts zu erzählen,
+ nichts weiterzugeben.

Sorry, aber so wie es sich anhört solltest du deine Einstellung mal überdenken. Das sage ich jetzt nicht, weil du meine Steuern willst, oder was auch immer, sondern weil du dir darüber im Klaren sein solltest, dass deine Zeit hier endlich ist. Das heißt im Klartext sowas wie;

+ heute ist der erste Tag vom Rest deines Lebens,
+ gestern hast du schon morgen gesagt, tu es jetzt,
+ jadda jadda, blabla.

Aber ernsthaft. Ich glaube in Deutschland wirst du nicht so krass vor die Wahl gestellt und ich denke, genau das ist bei dir das Problem. Du sitzt in deinem kleinen Käfig und bist eigentlich ganz zufrieden mit deiner täglichen Langeweile. Niemand hat dich rausgeschubst und gesagt ""so, mach was draus!"". 

Dafür ist es jetzt sowieso zu spät. Die Leute, die das hätten machen können, haben schon lange kein Sorgerecht mehr und du bist volljährig.

Und trotzdem kannst du auch mit deinen 25 Jahren noch was mit und aus deinem Leben machen, wenn du denn den kleinsten Funken Ansporn hast. Und in irgendeiner verqueren Art und Weise bin ich davon überzeugt, dass du das hast. Falls dich das bisher Geschriebene also nur ansatzweise angesprochen hat: Lies weiter. Sonst lieber nicht.

Wie du vorgehen solltest:

**1.  Vergiss die Anderen!**
Ganz wichtig. Vergiss, was andere bereits in deinem Alter erreicht haben. Vergiss, was sie bereits machen und können. Das bist nicht du. Du bist das, was du gerade tust und du hast deine eigenen Ziele.

**2. Motiviere dich selbst!**
Du sagst 40 Stunden die Woche ist zu viel? Ja, dann fang mit 20 an. Oder wie bereits beschrieben versuche es mit Freelancearbeit. Ich finde, du solltest noch drei Schritte weiter vorne anfangen und dir verdammt nochmal täglich die Zähne putzen! Warum? Weil eine Veränderung mit dir anfängt und je mehr du dich um dich selbst kümmerst, desto mehr merkst du, dass du liebenswert bist. Dass dein Leben *lebenswert ist* und du das Recht hast Spaß zu haben, etwas in deinem Leben zu erreichen! Vielleicht kommt danach die tägliche Dusche, der Haarschnitt, neue Klamotten? Keine Kohle? Vielleicht hilft doch ein Job. Merkst du vielleicht worauf ich hinaus will? DU bist wichtig. Du musst es nur merken.

**3. Übernimm dich nicht!**
Veränderungen brauchen Zeit und niemand kennt dich selbst so gut wie du selbst. Du wirst mit der Zeit dein Tempo finden, wirst dich selbst anders kennenlernen. Wirst dich lieben und hassen, versagen und aufgeben. Doch wieder weitermachen. Das weiß ich, weil du es schon tust. Nur musst du es dir bewusst machen. Du bist schon auf dieser Welt und auch wenn du versuchst in deinem kleinen Käfig zu bleiben, so musst du trotzdem immer wieder ein bisschen raus. Lerne es zu genießen, lerne Erfolg zu spüren, wo vorher ein Schulterzucken war. Es ist tatsächlich alles Einstellungssache. Und es ist, so beschissen es sich anhört, nie zu spät **etwas** aus sich zu machen.


Am Anfang hat mir bei meinem Weg Reddit geholfen. Ich denke, dass das, mit dem man sich umgibt, auch den Charakter prägt. Ich habe also mehr Subreddits abonniert, die mich angefixt haben, Dinge zu machen. Einfach Dinge. Natürlich das altbekotzte /r/GetMotivated, dann /r/Fitness, /r/running etc.. Einfach weil m. M. n. ein gesunder Geist auch nur in einem gesunden Körper wohnen kann. Und weil es wieder Dinge sind, die **ich** interessant finde und die ich für **mich** tue. Für niemanden sonst. Und trotzdem wirkt es auf Leute. Man wird selbstbewusster, fitter, lustvoller, ... im Endeffekt glücklicher.

Mach daraus, was du willst. Vergiss es vielleicht auch gleich wieder.

If it, against my expectations, manages these assets to benefit the Greek people, then I will be pleasantly surprised.

I honestly believe other EZ members realize this, and will do everything in their power to ensure the sale of assets is proper and economically reasonable. Merkel et al do not want to ""buy"" greece. These assets are peanuts in the long run. They want to finally ram reforms through a dysfunctional political system that has managed to resist creditor influence so far. Issues of sovereignty nonwithstanding, the momentum provided by creditor pressure might actually play out in the greek people's favour in the long run, much as EU influence has had a positive influence on corruption in prospective member countries.

Now if *anything* else was to be the case, the EU would be completely discredited as a cooperative union.

null,false,the_straylight_run,null,null,null,"Ironically, your scenario of referendum in the future is likely to happen. If Left Platform dissents, as well as ANEL, it's looking like Syriza will fall apart. Left Platform is 1/3 of Syriza MPs, and ANEL is saying they'll only support Tsipras as long as it's exclusively a two party coalition. 

These two parts leaving mean that Tsipras can stay in power only as long as he passes legislation that ND endorses. This means ND becomes the defacto coalition leader, and will have kingmaker or final say on the existence of the government.

Sure, these parties can pass the Auserity bill at present. But how long before they come into conflict? First time they do, it will lead to elections, and the outcome of such is really uncertain. It is also likely that the longer the austerity goes on, the more likely civil unrest and political activism by both extreme right and extreme left will bring about a call for elections. Future outlook of Greece politically looks entirely unstable.

So my point is that if this possibility is a real fear, which it should be, then don't loan the money. Since it's clear that a mutually satisfactory, or at least mutually acceptible, outcome to negotiations aren't possible, best course is for all parties to go their separate ways. 

From my POV, these 'negotiations' have shown the true inner workings and character of Europe. We're back to old rivalries and nationalistic bickering, alongside a pretty naked play for power. I no longer see any reason for nations like the PIIGS to want to stay in such a place, and the dream of a common better future appears to have been the first casualty.

Germans don't feel comfortable loaning the money? That's fine. I don't think Greeks feel comfortable with the conditionality apparent with those loans. I think a lot of people now consider Tsipras to be a traitor to his principles and his party, and I would put a pretty soon expiration date on the government in Greece. Maybe a year, maybe less. 

Thus, realistically, we've gone farther than we can go, and despite the fact that the two of us have been going round and round for weeks about whose position is right, I think our sides will never agree, and that accordingly, we should agree to move on. 

I would rather Greece suffer significantly now and be able to rebuild than to see this situation drag on and get worse over time. I think you would feel better without the new 'sick man' of Europe dragging you back, and not feeling like you're throwing your money away.

Article 9

1. The Community shall be based upon a customs union covering the exchange of all goods and comprising both the prohibition, as between Member States, of customs duties on importation and exportation and all charges with equivalent effect and the adoption of a common customs tariff in their relations with third countries.

2. The provisions of Chapter 1, Section 1 and of Chapter 2 of this Title shall apply to products originating in Member States and also to products coming from third countries and having been entered for consumption in Member States.

Article 10

1. Products having been entered for consumption in a Member State shall be deemed to be products coming from a third country in cases where, in respect of such products, the necessary import formalities have been complied with and the appropriate customs duties or charges with equivalent effect have been levied in such Member State and where such products have not benefited by any total or partial drawback on such duties or charges.

2. The Commission shall, before the end of the first year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, lay down the methods of administrative co-operation to be adopted for the application of Article 9, paragraph 2, taking due account of the need for reducing as far as possible the formalities imposed on trade.

Before the end of the first year after the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, the Commission shall lay down the provisions applicable, as regards trade between Member States, to goods originating in another Member State in whose manufacture products have been used on which the appropriate customs duties or charges with equivalent effect in the exporting Member State have not been levied or which have benefited by a total or partial drawback on such duties or charges.

When laying down such provisions, the Commission shall take due account of the rules for the elimination of customs duties within the Community and for the progressive application of the common customs tariff.",null,0,null,1436870478,null,0,false,0,ct2ryqr,null,t3_3d8m7f,null,t1_ct2ryqr,null,t3_3d8m7f,null,null,null,1437841328,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

null,false,Flakarmor,DENK,Denmark,null,"Alright comrade, so you've established that Georgia attacked South Ossetia after SO broke the ceasefire treaty by using heavy weapons. Great. So what does it matter to Russia that they were using their whole army?

You already know that their claims of genocide were unfounded. If anything, it was the SO attacks on Georgian villages that are appalling.

So why does Russia enter the picture? They weren't allowed to do anything more than evacuate their peacekeepers regardless of what Ryan Grist said. Yet they were already in SO with troops before Georgian operations began.

From your first wiki-link.
&gt;In September 2008, Georgia released recordings of intercepted phone calls to prove that the Russian military moved into South Ossetia before the Georgian military operation began. The New York Times made its own translation from the original Ossetian language into Russian and then into English. Senior American officials reviewed the recordings and considered them as credible.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War#Early_August

&gt;According to Pavel Felgenhauer, the Ossetians intentionally provoked the Georgians, so Russia would use the Georgian response as a pretext for premeditated military invasion.[123]

&gt;According to Georgian intelligence,[124] and several Russian media reports, parts of the regular (non-peacekeeping) Russian Army already moved to South Ossetian territory through the Roki Tunnel before the Georgian military operation.

Much more ironically - if you look up Ryan Grist's wiki page.

&gt;The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) claimed that in an interview Grist acknowledged he crossed through Russian lines without authorization on his own initiative to determine the facts, which ultimately cost him his OSCE job. He resigned from the OSCE immediately after the war.

Spain has put for the bailouts of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus, 43 billions already

Now Spain has to put another 12 that's 55 billions total. Spain is a significant chunk of the Eurozone so that's understandable.


Now Spain's bailout for its banks were **up to** 100 billions. And the final figures of how much we took before terminating the program vary depending of where I look but they are around the 60 Billion figure.


So ""lo comido por lo servido"" as we say in Spain ""What is eaten for what is served"" (traslating idioms :S). Might as well pay our debt with the debt of others and we go 0, amrite?



The math **is wrong**, because the money is not actually lend, its guaranteed/endorsed so we don't put actual money, also the same way Spain didnt get the whole 100 billions, Ireland and Portugal probably didn't either; Also the interests are not the same and there might be other miscalculations but its funny nonetheless.",null,0,null,1436871353,null,0,1436878456,0,ct2s6oc,null,t3_3d6op2,null,t1_ct2s6oc,null,t3_3d6op2,null,null,null,1437841431,null,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7,null

out of curiosity, why do we need Europe to live? I assume you are referring to europe not as a continent, but some kind of ideology or set of values?  Why is political integration through the EU the answer?

Bold statements in the previous comments, but you fail to ever argue for why we need or should want any of this? 


""I've never even once said that my vision of Europe is based on the structure of the EU as we know it nowadays. I think that European Integration is inevitable and overdue.

Overlooking the initial premise that we somehow need ""europe"" to live, you claim that the giving away national sovereignty to EU is the only way of achieving ""europe"" while at the same time claiming that your vision of europe is not based on the structure of the EU. 

It makes it hard to debate on the topic if you fail to justify your initial premise, then seemingly blindly support the EU project, claim that anyone not on board is ignorant, and finally brush off any criticism of you views by claiming they are not based on the way the EU works either way.

Basically, the reforms worked in terms of getting Greece out of recession and managed to create a budget surplus, it only now that Syriza came to power that they are back in recession. Syriza also managed to be incompetent enough to get a much worse deal for Greece than the one they could've gotten months ago while also putting Greece back into a recession. That's just the state of things, those are numbers.

In short, if reforms would've been implemented when they should have and fully like it was asked of them, Greece would already probably be back to economic growth by now, this way they and Syriza managed to make sure they will suffer for way longer than it would've been necessary.

As demonstrated by right wing populists gaining traction all over Europe, proper political understanding and a foresighted, careful understanding of politics can not be expected by the public. Large masses tend to vote badly, as they don't all follow politics or are experts on the matters involved, which is the sole reason direct democracies don't work. 

&gt; Those people decided to spit in the face of their allies when they voted no.

'Allies'? You mean those that forced a decade of austerity, which was bound to not do anything at all from the very first day? Mistakes have been made. The former Greek government forging books and taking ridiculous credits was absolute bullshit, but part of the blame lies on the other side as well. But either way the eurozone had a very hostile way of dealing with things from the very beginning. Certain people like Schäuble acted on a way to personal level, forgot all of the values the EU is supposed to carry, and seemed to seriously want a Grexit from the very beginning.

Yeah. This would have been the best / most sustainable solution for everyone. No idea why anyone would only want it to be temporary, it's obviously not a good match of economies, as people have said for years, including before the crisis started. 


 ""I owe you money. You decide to give me a lot more time to pay this money back. You also lend me more money. In exchange, you want me to tell you how I plan on paying this money back.""

I think it's not quite the way it happens. It's obviously not a perfect analogy, but I think it is closer to you owe me money, you can't pay and ask for more time, I instead lend you more money to pay me back right now + more interest later, you then fail to keep up with payments again, so I lend you more money and ask you to tell me how you plan to pay me back. You devise a plan (which may or may not be good), I refuse it and dictate the plan to you, but take your car which you need to get to work so there is no chance you will ever be able to earn enough to pay me back.  

There is no doubt in my mind that the greek government should refuse the deal. They are screwed anyway, they might as well take the pain of default or partial default, and regain control of their currency.

To my knowledge there are no simple short lists available. Reliable ones that is. The best, and pretty much the only way to make sense on what has been demanded and what Greece has actually done is to read the relevant reports. Unfortunately that involves reading/browsing through hundreds of pages, or even several thousands as I have done during the last five years. But you could try reading the summaries of the documents to get at least some sense.

A very good source are the Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece review reports. They include the reforms that Greece agreed to do as part of the second bailout program and the reforms they actually made.

Another very good source are the relevant IMF [documents on the IMF site](http://www.imf.org/external/country/grc/index.htm?type=9998), which has the relevant staff reports, program reviews, memorandums of understanding, letters of intent, and article IV consultations.

Here's the most recent program review: [Greece: Fifth Review Under the Extended Arrangement Under the Extended Fund Facility, and Request for Waiver of Nonobservance of Performance Criterion and Rephasing of Access; Staff Report; Press Release; and Statement by the Executive Director for Greece](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41614.0)
&gt;  Summary: This paper discusses Greece’s Fifth Review Under the Extended Arrangement Under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and Request for Waiver of Nonobservance of Performance Criterion and Rephasing of Access. Greece has gone from having the weakest to the strongest cyclically adjusted fiscal position within the euro area in just four years. But more fiscal adjustment is needed to restore debt sustainability. Structural reforms are progressing, although unevenly. The redoubling of efforts to liberalize products and service markets are much welcomed. On the basis of reforms undertaken in the context of this review, and the government’s policy commitments going forward, the IMF staff supports the completion of the fifth review.

And a relevant article IV consultation paper: [Greece : 2013 Article IV Consultation](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=40637.0)
&gt;  Summary: Fiscal expansion after euro accession led to a buildup of large economic imbalances, and a program to make fiscal policy and the fiscal and debt position sustainable was initiated. However, the program saw opposition from the outset and structural reforms stalled, which unsettled the investment climate. The Greek government’s determination to push ahead with reforms has seen progress in fiscal adjustment and perseverance of the financial sector. However, the social cost of the recession has been very high, and the current program can only succeed if policymakers address the root causes.

--

With the close of World War I, implementation of The Treaty of Versailles, and fall of the Weimar Republic hyperinflation set in.  The German Kaiser and Parliament decided to fund reparations, the war, and treaty obligations entirely by borrowing and increasing the money supply.  During the war the Mark steadily fell from 4.2 to 8.9 Marks per US dollar.  Due to hyperinflation by 1923 one US dollar was worth 4,210,500,000,000 German marks.

--

For understandable historical reasons any move, which may be interpreted as inflationary, is unconsciously compared to Weimar Republic-era hyperinflation.  Any such program then is not seen objectively, for what it is, but through evocative lens of bread lines, starvation, and hopelessness. 

--

The rest of Europe is a mixed-bag. From ex-Warsaw pact members who have little to no developed economic doctrine or approach, to Sweden, Finland, Norway, et al. who are not great case-studies for economic doctrine in large monetary unions.

Our news programs are great compared to the US, where you only have a choice of which bias you would rather listen to and actual information is scarce.

There are a lot less commercials even on commercial channels than in the US. I once watched Big Bang theory in the US. 1 Scene, cut, commercial. next scene, cut, commercial. In the end I didn't know which episode I had just watched.

I don't even watch live television anymore. I record what I like and watch it later.

As a hint, EinsPlus, ZDF Kultur, ZDFneo and some other channels offer good stuff for younger audiences. Also, not all documentaries are about the DDR or Nazi times ;-)

A nonfiction show that is always thought-provoking is ""37 Grad"". One of my favourite comedy shows is ""Switch reloaded"" where they make fun of other TV programs. Very well done.

Countries wouldn't default on debts excessively for the same reason they don't now, the reason offered by the other poster. Without risk there wouldn't be a market for government bonds. Interest payments would be 0, profit would be 0, governments wouldn't function. Thankfully the market is capable of calculating the trustworthiness of governments, and does so on a continual basis. Governments like Greece face higher borrowing costs. This isn't a good thing so most countries try to be trustworthy and pay the IMF. When the Greek debt was unsustainable then people/institutions/gov'ts should have stopped purchasing them. Those who continued should have risked not getting paid, the government going into default.

left wing politics is what has lead Greece to where it is. No matter how much you want to, you can't overpay public servants by 200% and expect the economy not to suffer, you can't let trade unions destroy half the businesses in the country and expect the economy not to suffer, you can't buy voters and expect the economy not to suffer. Restricted professions, who in the hell thinks that's a good idea? There are people who could work, but they aren't allowed to, because too much competition makes life harder for the privileged ones who already have that job in town. WTF?

Unless you have 10% inflation, this left wing shit works only as long as you can trick investors into lending your country more money. Well, in 2010 Greece couldn't find enough fools anymore, so that was over then. 

And Greece can't inflate away the unfair privileges that their left wing politics have generated, and Greece seems unable to remove those privileges by passing laws, because the corruption is so entrenched.

After everything that happened, Grexit was the only realistic option left, that's why Schäuble and a few others are in favor of it, even though it costs them at least $100B.

The only alternative, after a lot of haggling sunday night, is to ensure in the third bailout that Greece actually does the reforms this time, not just taking more from the weakest 40% of Greek society, but from the 60% privileged -- the rich, politically connected, public servants, union workers, etc

As for your question, if Cali companies sell a lot to other states (I assume they do, but I don't know that for sure), then it works the same way, however, the job market in the States is way more unified than here, so it's easier to move from Mississippi or, say, Cleveland OH, if their economies aren't doing too well, to some place that's economically vibrant. Not so easy here despite EU's efforts, not to mention the people aren't so keen on that either.

I would suggest Venezia, but if yo're intrested in the lake, make sure to visit Bellaggio, Varenna and Menaggio, Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo, and the Como city center.

Absolutely... Different states have different requirements, different levels and avenues of support available to them and so on. Of course they will be dealt with on a case by case basis. The EU hasn't responded in the same way to each failing economy either, nor has the Eurozone looked to intervene outside of the Eurozone.. But again, the issue here is the reported unilateral attempt to reverse an agreement and claim it wouldn't apply as it was simply a political accord..

The situation in Greece is far more complex and a lot of people tend to ignore 90% of the facts and turn it into some sort of identity crisis, mixed with communism and nationalism. There are lots of people who are still alive and remember very well how that ended the last time that was the primary scene. And we can see how that' working out on the EU's eastern border. Given the flag next to my user, I think you'll understand what I mean when I say that sometimes the wrong people have to pay the wrong price. But we all do it anyway and it's best if we accept reality as it is. Yes, I live in a city that has more than doubled it's population in less than a decade and while a lot of effort has been made to make it look nice, there is no denial that there are areas, which to my mind are completely uninhabitable, but I accept it. Surely it's not my fault for being a soviet province for 50+ years but that's the reality. And I accept the reality: I have to pay the price along with many others for generations to come. The same way you can tell which is east and west Berlin when you see two pictures. Except we didn't have west Sofia, and everything I like about it is either new or 100+ years old. It's not fair but the world is not a fair place and it never will be. Reality bites. 2 decades ago I would have simply called it a Balkan syndrome but now I know it's a well known phenomenon across Europe. People tend to blame everyone but themselves and no one is willing to admit that most commonly the problem is internal and not external.

And by Internal and external, I don't purely mean in-state and foreign but personal as well. The ability to say ""hey, I got it wrong, I'm sorry"". But instead people praise false prophets(Guy Verhofstadt was absolutely right when he used that term). Whether they will be dyed in the wool socialists or ""I'm not racist but..."", hate me all you want for saying it but I see no difference whatsoever. Because as you can see now, the far left and far right in the EU parliament are together and support each other almost unconditionally. And what they all fail to understand is that there are people in the other countries and they keep ignoring their will. There were 4 or so elections this year. And let's face it, the winners' campaigns were nothing other than hatred. Call them left, call them right - they are the exact same incompetent morons who lead to more problems and less solutions.

Greece made it far worse for themselves but that was expected - you can't pretend that you are having a civilized discussion with someone and the next second start calling him or her a terrorist. It's not how that works. You are either a skitzo or a complete moron. 

I'm not saying that it's the Greeks' fault entirely. But they are to blame. Germans on the other hand were expecting to meet people that are just as willing to change as they are. Germans are extremely good at changing and learning from their mistakes and they are willing to admit them, as history shows.

The other big mistake that people are calling the EU ""ideology"". It never was ideology and it never will be. Cherry-picking is not how a union works. Ideology leads to communism and some of us know how that works(or rather how it doesn't). The point here is to: 1) Face the facts and admit that even the big states in Europe are too small to compete with the US, China, Japan, etc. 2) Instead of finding more reasons to hate each other and act like someone else should do everything for us, adapt, cooperate and hate it or not, pay a certain price. 

tl; dr With or without the EU, the prices that people have to pay for their or other people's mistakes won't come down.

Many people in favor of the monarchy are not staunch monarchists, but rather people that think that the status quo is better than an uncertain republic, or simply indiferent. It's a ""if ain't broke don't fix it"" kind of attitude.

The monarchy is strongly founded on the public perception of the previous king and his role in the [Spanish transition to democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_transition_to_democracy) and the [1981 coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23-F). The system is based in the King's necessary virtue. In other words, the King has to be perfect for the system to work, and the media and the mainstream parties did their best for decades to protect the King's public image and to cultivate this hero myth. When the King's image started to deteriorate in the last decade, the King was forced to abdicate and the prince was crowned. The media and the mainstream parties closed ranks around the new king, who must be even more ""perfect"" than his father.

There is also a strong anti-republican current in Spain's conservatism with roots in our pretty complex history. Many people in favor or against a hypothetical republic have very strong opinions on the [Second Spanish Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic) and the Spanish Civil War, and consequently the republic-monarchy debate is often very emotionally-charged. In the minds of many conservative and progressive people, the republic is a communist/leftist system.

Those who favor the monarchy for more rational reasons tend to think that we benefit from having an impartial head of state that has no part in the political game. In my opinion this a very pessimistic view that stems from the belief that all politicians are crooked and the people can't be trusted with electing the head of state.

But the majority of monarchists base their position in contingent historical reasons, rather tha purely abstract political ideas. When asked, conservative politicians usually refer to the monarchy's alleged success to secure ""the longest period of peace and stability in Spain's history"" or that the [1978 Constitutional Referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_constitutional_referendum,_1978) legitimized the monarchy, as the monarchy was part of the proposed constitution.

This is a very weird situation that has its roots in the turbulent transition to democracy and the interest of the maintream political forces in keeping the status quo, since questioning the monarchy leads to questioning the whole political system created in the late 70s.",null,0,null,1436875854,null,0,1436876463,0,ct2tjrr,null,t3_3d87qf,null,t1_ct2tjrr,null,t3_3d87qf,null,null,null,1437842076,null,10,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,10,null

If you let him shoot twice and it is a goal 2 times, there is a large probability that this person is lucky.
If you let him shoot 100 times, and it is a goal 100 times, then the probability that he is ""not lucky"" but actually good is much higher.

With those particles it's the same.
They don't detect those particles themselves, but rather the energies and paths of their decay products.
However, as there is a lot going on, you sort of have to filter out the unwanted random events that produce similar signals. (the background)

So, what they do is, they calculate what background they can expect for different energies and so.
Then they put the data from the experiment in a histogram and this histogram will take on the shape of the background +  some bumps for those special particles.

Now as they are dealing with random events, there is a possibility that the bumps just occur randomly.  That's where statistics come in. The **sigmas** are a value that says how 'unlikely' the bump in the graph is made by random fluctuations.


Now, in previous experiments, they saw a small bump, but they had too few events to reach a **5-sigma** certainty that it was special.
(like making the footballer only shoot in the goal twice, is he good or lucky? We don't know)

Greece can at any time default their loans, that is their right as an sovereign. However what they don't have right is to think that after that the other Eurozone states or the IMF would give them loans. They wouldn't. The choice that successive Greek governments have made is to take loans and agree to do reforms that are intended to fix the issues plaguing the country.

&gt; And they aren't force dictated at debt point that they have to retroactivately revokate any and all spending passed by the elected governement since february.

If Greek governments don't want any new loans from the Eurozone or the IMF, then they can say OXI. But what the Greek governments can't do is to force other countries to give them new loans. As long as this is the situation, the Greek government has to follow the agreements that it has agreed to follow.

&gt; Nor they are held hostage by Germany because Germany as a personnal hate for Syriza &amp; friends because they refused to sell the country

The problem with Syriza is that they believed that they are vanguard of European economic revolution. They thought that with rhetoric and public relations work they could make masses to move in Spain, Italy and France so that these countries would also agree on moving against austerity and liberal economics. They failed in this. They also failed with their gamble against the rest of the Eurozone. They intended to cause havoc in financial markets by having an referendum of essentially Greece leaving the Eurozone if Institutions don't back out. However what happened is that the rest of the Eurozone called this bluff and after the OXI vote, there was no crisis, no panic in the markets. That is what Syriza did and that is where they failed.

If Syriza would instead of trying to go back to old statist ways of managing Greece would have made market liberalizations, would have cut excessive public spending and corruption, it would have gained political capital that it could have used to negotiate a real European Investment Fund that would stimulate growth especially in troubled economies. Unfortunately they didn't do this, they weren't constructive at all, and now everybody in Greece is paying for that now when the banks are closed for the third week in a row.

null,false,ABoutDeSouffle,GERM,Germany,null,"**IMF: Greece needs much deeper debt relief**

Breaking away from Brussels.... a leaked International Monetary Fund report has shown that Greece needs massively more debt relief than the eurozone has admitted.

The IMF has updated its debt sustainability analysis to reflect the damage wrecked on the Greek economy since capital controls were imposed more than two weeks ago.

And it shows that even more Greek debt needs to be wiped away that Europe faced up to.

The IMF says:

&gt;“The dramatic deterioration in debt sustainability points to the need for debt relief on a scale that would need to go well beyond what has been under consideration to date - and what has been proposed by the ESM.”

Currently, eurozone countries have been talking about ‘reprofiling’ Greek debt, to push back repayment dates or cut the interest rate on loans.

But this IMF report states that Greece would need a 30-year grace period.

Alternatively, the eurozone could make explicit annual transfers of cash to Greece, or it could bite the bullet and take “deep upfront haircuts”.

**Instant reaction: IMF says no more extend and pretend**

The IMF’s leaked report is potentially dynamite, because the Fund cannot lend to a country if it doesn’t believe it would be sustainable.

So unless Europe swallows the reality that Greece needs major debt relief, the IMF won’t provide any more bailout funds.

Officially, the IMF line that it “stands ready to work with the Greek authorities,”

But we can now see that it is actually saying that another “extend and pretend” bailout deal is fundamentally flawed

But they couldn't without being kicked out of the EU and tsipras was elected to stay in. And germany openly used that to blackmail them into signing the most humiliating treaty they could get away with and that would maximise German money return.

&gt; However what they don't have right is to think that after that the other Eurozone states or the IMF would give them loans.

If the golden dawn takes power, they won't give two shit. They'll probably even kill a few people from the get to go to earn themselves point at home. It's like trying negociating with putin while he's busy sending tank trains in Ukraine.

And you know who scores just behind Syriza ? Yep, the GD. Oh and also since lots of those bastards where jailed they'll not listen to anyone even remotely reasonable that oppposed them. By making Syriza a complete failure, you offered them power. Oh and you know who is the most hated man in Greece ? Mr Schäuble, or so i hear. 

&gt; But what the Greek governments can't do is to force other countries to give them new loans.

No, but what the black block can do is ignore the gov when they get even more fed up than pseudo ""reasonable"" people like me; and start acting like the red army movement in germany 20y ago. Remember ? Let alone talking about the GD that would just re arm the country if they could get away with it.

&gt; The problem with Syriza is that they believed that they are vanguard of European economic revolution.

That was idiotic, but for some reason i'll take them over the violent golden dawn nazi any day of the year.

&gt;  would have made market liberalizations,

Neo liberalism and ""trickle down"" theory doesn't work. The living standard in free fall since 5y in Greece (despite enforced neoliberalism since 2007) are the exact proof of that. The GDP was ""rising"" but most of the population is living on 800/mo. Why ? Because the money all goes to the oligarchs and nothing moves.

Syriza was elected to change that. If you can't understand why people are tired of eating pastas for every meal, heating a day on two in winter, making do 20km without the car to save on gaz, ""forgetting"" 20% of their groceries at the register because they don't have enough money for it, and selling stuff lying at home to pay the rent month after month, then maybe you are a bit disconnected from the real situation in greece.

&gt; would have cut excessive public spending and corruption

While that is definitely needed, stuff like ""let's sell the akropolis to germany"" is just completely bonkers. They'll fight you to the last before that happen. It's like if Germany decided to suddenly sell Berlin because of standing bills. That's never going to happen, Ever.

&gt; it would have gained political capital

No they wouldn't. Germany makes ridiculous amounts of money on the poverty and lack of competitivity of southern countries like Italy or Greece. If their economy pick up again, germany loose money. So of course it's not popular in Germany to help them rebuild for example by letting them print Euros. Are you screams indicating i'm wrong ?

&gt; , they weren't constructive at all

Well, neither was Mr Schauble from times to times either.

&gt; and now everybody in Greece is paying for that now when the banks are closed for the third week in a row.

Paying they will; but if Germany touch &amp; intend to annexate the land by force; i'll stick to my disgusting side and i can already tell you they'll get 200 factory fresh reserve T72 tanks that were intended for Ukraine.

A welfare subvention given to people who have to survive on pensions WELL below the poverty line (i'm talking people who make do with like 400€/mo). And apparently that too was part of ""Spending like a drunken Sailor"" (c).

Greece spend 16.2% of its GDP to pensions. Other countries such as Finland spend 12%, and Germany, Austria, etc.. spend over 10%. In the coming decades as the demographic status of European countries goes weaker, even more money is spend to pensions. In Finland that ages faster, at the peak in 2030 it is calculated that around 15% of the GDP is used to pensions. However the difference between Finland and Greece is that Finland has already long ago done cuts to pension and introduced age multiplier that cuts automatically pensions the longer people live, in addition to that pension funds have been funded better and longer time than Greeks have done. Fact of the matter is that Greek pension spending must be cut, there is no way around it.

The Greeks can either cut down EKAS or they can cut down pensions themselves. Something has to be done, if the Greeks won't do the cuts, then the Eurogroup will suggest cuts.

&gt; Well spoilers, how are they going to feed the population if all the money to do that is going back to germany ?

The Greeks pay less as interest payments (2.5%) than Spanish, Irish, Italians and Portuguese do. [source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11372369/Three-myths-about-Greeces-enormous-debt-mountain.html)  This is because loans given by Eurozone have given them loans with very low interest rates and with long maturity. The current financial crisis in Greece isn't because of the money loaned by Eurozone states, Greece is in trouble because it exited the second bailout program and thus couldn't refinance loans to be paid back to IMF and ECB. Debts that Greece has to other Eurozone states are not planned to be paid before 2020.

Similarly, human rights really didn't begin in the 1700s... none of these statements of the rights of man prevented the slave trade, for example.

Obviously death penalty and torture were still present. But Enlightment brought the idea that they were wrong and useless. For istance, see [On crimes and punishments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Crimes_and_Punishments).

And the same holds for humans rights. Slavery, racial and sexual discrimantion were present, but Enlightment claimed that –at least in theory– they are wrong. It may not have great effects immediatly, but it surely had across time. Enlightment is the reason why sexism, racism or religious states are frowned upond, differently from other countries and other cultures. 

Enlightment changed and took different forms in different countries.

Taking exotic hadrons as granted might soften the impact when they're actually found in experiment, but empirical observation is still a vital part of doing science. The Higgs was also part of accepted mainstream particle physics for about as long as tetra/pentaquarks before it was discovered.

The finance ministers in Europe are like the government finance in the U.S.: too close to the bankers.  And they've done such a marvellous job of deflecting the conversation away from this asepct that it isn't part of the public discourse anymore.   

But if you read articles from Ireland at the time of their bailout you'll see the Irish were very close to telling the EU to stuff it and letting their banks default.  But again the threats from Germany and Ireland caved.  This difference with Ireland was there was almost no public debt.  And they saddled the Irish tax payer with all the bank private debt.

I remember won interview with, IIRC, a senior IMF person where Irish journalists asking why the Irish tax payers must pay for the mistakes private bankers, why German private banks couldn't take their losses the way people do after a bad investment and he merely shrugged and said this was he way it had to be done.   He looked like a statue playing a broken record.

Then maybe the issue is the GDP getting murdered by the austerity (the income) and not the spending ?

If money's not supposed to pay for the rent and car loan and food of the citizens, what is it intended to ? Only pay germany ? Pay private jets for the billionaires while everyone is in shit ?

&gt;  Other countries such as Finland spend 12%, and Germany, Austria, etc.. spend over 10%

Because germany as a way bigger GDP. Per capita Germany spend WAYYYYYYY more money on every citizens.

I was always wondering how things would turn out there if age-slowing meds did manage to hit the market before that cap. Oh well we'll see.

&gt; Fact of the matter is that Greek pension spending must be cut, there is no way around it.

Yes, but stuff like EKAS, no limit on wage collections or joking about taking land ? I'm tempted to just say ""get lost"".

Actually no, the Troika was deciding the conditions on that one ? People were saying Varoufakis tried to negociate with the results we all know; and they started at him for 5min without moving like he insulted them, then they started repeating their conditions for ""the only possible agreement"" ? Or did i got everything wrong ?

Sorry but the fact that some countries has it worse than greek doesn't make greece's situation any better. Whether you are loan sharking and harassing the guy for a 10% or 2.5% debt is still harassing them for a debt.

&gt; and thus couldn't refinance loans to be paid back to IMF and ECB

So according to you one of the best way to a sustainable greece debt swapping with another debt with new interests piled on top of all the pasts ones (ie more debts in the end) ? Isn't that what killed a lot of third world countries like ressource rich african nations or in southern america ?

US States can't file for bankruptcy.

http://www.csg.org/pubs/capitolideas/enews/issue65_3.aspx

&gt; Why can’t states use the federal bankruptcy system to reorganize their debt?
&gt;
&gt; “There are two reasons why state governments currently cannot use the federal bankruptcy system to reorganize their debt. First, the federal bankruptcy code does not allow—and has never allowed—state governments to declare bankruptcy. Since 1937, the bankruptcy code has allowed ‘municipalities’ to declare bankruptcy. The term ‘municipality’ is defined in the bankruptcy code as a ‘political subdivision or public agency or instrumentality of a state.’ This definition is broad enough to include cities, counties, townships, school districts and public improvement districts. It also includes revenue-producing bodies that provide services which are paid for by users rather than by general taxes, such as bridge authorities, highway authorities and gas authorities. But it does not include state governments.
&gt;
&gt; “The second reason stems from the U.S. Constitution. The contracts clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits state governments from ‘impairing the obligation of contracts.’ As originally understood and enforced, this clause prohibited state legislatures from passing any laws to relieve either private debt or the state government's own debt. Beginning in 1934, however, the Supreme Court began to interpret the contracts clause more flexibly and not as an absolute bar to state debt relief laws. Even under the flexible modern approach, however, the Supreme Court in 1977 reiterated that ‘a state cannot refuse to meet its legitimate financial obligations simply because it would prefer to spend the money (on something else.)’ Thus, were Congress to amend the federal bankruptcy code to authorize states to repudiate debt, the Supreme Court would then need to decide the novel constitutional question of whether such debt repudiation would nonetheless violate the contracts clause of Article I, Section 10.”",null,0,null,1436878476,null,0,false,0,ct2uk86,null,t3_3d8b84,null,t1_ct2uk86,null,t1_ct2s9k8,null,null,null,1437842843,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

I cannot agree with you on this. German TV has its bright spots. Most of them are past productions with surprisingly good acting. Der Bulle von Tölz, Der Alte, Derrick (yeah, I know, these three are crime shows, but they were great), Ein Herz und eine Seele (one of the funniest if not the most funny german production). Sadly, nobody wants to watch these shows anymore. I'd love to watch re-runs of those 4 shows.

In the future, we should never again change the relationship from having private banks on the one side and a defaulting state on the other side, to a situation where each member state has to calculate how they can sell this at home, where there are also always problems.

They wouldn't be kicked, even Schäuble confirmed this. However if Greece would default its loans, then financially the best option for it would be to exit the Eurozone and thus the EU. However the Greeks could choose to say in the Eurozone as they would have had defaulted their loans, there would be no banks left in Greece, and there would be no Greek pensions funds left standing.

In case of humiliation, getting an 80 billion EUR loan from other Eurozone states is hardly humiliation. Should the other Eurozone state just gifted Tsipras with that 80 billion EUR? I don't think that would have gone so well with citizens of those Eurozone states.

&gt; If the golden dawn takes power, they won't give two shit. They'll probably even kill a few people from the get to go to earn themselves point at home. It's like trying negociating with putin while he's busy sending tank trains in Ukraine.

If people in Greece decide to vote for Golden Dawn, then they will. If Golden Dawn will default, then they will.

&gt; Neo liberalism and ""trickle down"" theory doesn't work. The living standard in free fall since 5y in Greece (despite enforced neoliberalism since 2007) are the exact proof of that. The GDP was ""rising"" but most of the population is living on 800/mo. Why ? Because the money all goes to the oligarchs and nothing moves.

Greece is hardly a paragon of neo liberalism. If you want to see liberal economic policies in action why not go the the Nordics, to Finland and Sweden. In these countries the people have understood that what isn't important is who owns production equipment, but on who income is redistributed in a manner that creates a fair and equal opportunity society for everybody. I would rather compare Greece to former Yugoslavia, it has a mixed economy, bloated public sector employees more people than it needs, publicly owned companies cause huge losses, etc... Let me make an example... Bank of Greece has 3000 employees. The Bank of Finland including financial authority has 600. Finnish economy is the size of Greek economy, even if you would scale the employee count of Bank of Greece by population, the Bank of Greece shouldn't have more than 1200 employees. This is the Greek model and it doesn't work. Just employing people in the public sector doesn't create value by itself, those people actually have to produce something to generate value.

&gt; Syriza was elected to change that. If you can't understand why people are tired of eating pastas for every meal, heating a day on two in winter, making do 20km without the car to save on gaz, ""forgetting"" 20% of their groceries at the register because they don't have enough money for it, and selling stuff lying at home to pay the rent month after month, then maybe you are a bit disconnected from the real situation in greece.

That is regrettable, but the situation is what it is. Maybe if the Greek state would redistribute money more fairly and not spend 16.2% of GDP to pensions, the situation would be better. Do remember that if pensions would be cut to 12% that Finland spend, it would free up to 9.9% billion USD that could be used for example assist people in need directly.

&gt; While that is definitely needed, stuff like ""let's sell the akropolis to germany"" is just completely bonkers. They'll fight you to the last before that happen. It's like if Germany decided to suddenly sell Berlin because of standing bills. That's never going to happen, Ever.

Nobody has suggested that to happen.

&gt; No they wouldn't. Germany makes ridiculous amounts of money on the poverty and lack of competitivity of southern countries like Italy or Greece. If their economy pick up again, germany loose money. So of course it's not popular in Germany to help them rebuild for example by letting them print Euros. Are you screams indicating i'm wrong ?

Varoufakis suggestion on creating an investment fund got positive feedback from many places, even from Finland. The idea wouldn't be on giving trouble economies to print money, but essentially starting a fund that would get money from the markets, essentially from QE, that would then be invested into financially sound project. The thing is that there are lots of opportunities in troubled countries for investments that currently don't happen because on political instability. For Germany and other creditor countries in the north, this kind of fund would be heaven sent as it would create work in the south, it would allow southern countries become more productive and thus ease up pressure for northern states to fund them either via bailout funds of via direct fiscal transfers.

In case of making south competitive, what you have to understand that countries have different industrial clusters and strengths. Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have lost competitiveness not against Germany or other northern countries but against Chinese and other manufacturers in developing countries. And if you look at Germany, most of its trade surplus is formed from exporting to non-EU/non-Eurozone countries, inside Europe it largely runs balanced trade. The problem is that only Germany and Finland have balanced trade with China. To make the situation better, troubled countries in south have to not only export more to other Eurozone countries, but they also have to work for their products and services on selling better around the world.

&gt; Paying they will; but if you touch the land i can already tell you they'll get 200 factory fresh reserve T72 tanks that were intended for Ukraine.

What do you do with tanks if you don't have money to fuel them? Not to mention that nobody actually wants Greece, it is just a place to go for a holiday, nothing more, nothing less.

&gt; In case of humiliation, getting an 80 billion EUR loan from other Eurozone states is hardly humiliation. 

[Cutting the pension and food out of 70y old pensionners because the cash has to go to germany to pay back debts ""because you are overspending like drunk sailors"" definitely is.](http://blogs.afp.com/english/public/greece/greece_cryingman/.greece-cryingman4_m.jpg)

So, let me tell you the sympathy capital for Germany is *quite short* in greece too.

&gt; Should the other Eurozone state just gifted Tsipras with that 80 billion EUR? 

Actually, i think they should drop the BS on pensions and EKAS and a few other points like it; yes. Because otherwise it'll get them a war (yes, a real one) that will costs everyone A LOT MORE. And, again, the golden dawn don't give a shit about what people like you or I would say too them. They'll answer with bullets.

&gt; I don't think that would have gone so well with citizens of those Eurozone states.

So, the greek gov has to ruin his country and repeatedly lie to them at russian levels of propaganda; but the others can just take a walk ""because it's not our debt problem in fact"" ?

&gt; If people in Greece decide to vote for Golden Dawn, then they will. If Golden Dawn will default, then they will.

People vote for whoever will get them out of eating pastas every day and selling the couch to pay the next power bill. And the only ones after Syriza that say they will are the actual nazis. No this isn't intended as an insult against germany. It's actual , real, greek nazis.

&gt;  If you want to see liberal economic policies in action why not go the the Nordics, to Finland and Sweden

Uhhh, you mean the ones called ""welfares states"" ? What Germany just asked greece to abolish ?

&gt; I would rather compare Greece to former Yugoslavia, it has a mixed economy, bloated public sector employees more people than it needs, publicly owned companies cause huge losses, etc...

And maybe you should let Syriza do the reform they offered instead of telling them to starve the pensionners to death and sell the powerplants ?

&gt; Bank of Greece has 3000 employees. The Bank of Finland including financial authority has 600. 

Shuffle them in other departments ? There's a serious need for maintenance employees, retrain them and put anyone that can hold a shovel to construction work. Redirect accountants to other services, etc.

&gt; This is the Greek model and it doesn't work

Neither did starving african countries with debts and abolishing their welfare system.

Name me ONE country where the lifestyle actually rose by destroying pensions and healthcare ?

&gt; Just employing people in the public sector doesn't create value by itself, those people actually have to produce something to generate value.

https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/business-commerce-streamline-downsize-downsized-slave-row-wmi100817_low.jpg

You can't make the country a successfull one by scamming everyone out of their income (pension, wage, ...) and firing all the rest. Especially when there's already a 40% unemployment rate badly hidden by rigging official statistics.

&gt; That is regrettable, but the situation is what it is.

Well, let me tell you it's regrettable but it's war you're going to have if you persist continuously more with that debt bullshit.

&gt; Maybe if the Greek state would redistribute money more fairly and not spend 16.2% of GDP to pensions

""maybe if the greek gov redistributed money to pensionners and employees instead of paying them pensions and wages"" wait what ?

It's exactly what redistribution is called.

&gt; Nobody has suggested that to happen.

Riiiiiiiiight.

&gt; Varoufakis suggestion on creating an investment fund got positive feedback from many places, even from Finland

And he was fired.

&gt; Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have lost competitiveness not against Germany or other northern countries but against Chinese and other manufacturers in developing countries. 

Right. I still find it funny that most of said euros end up in german and Uk's investors pockets but country like greece only have debts.

&gt;  And if you look at Germany, most of its trade surplus is formed from exporting to non-EU/non-Eurozone countries

Trade surplus, another thing Greece doesn't have and can't have without building factories with money they don't have (because gottah pay germany first and no markets access).

&gt; to make the situation better, troubled countries in south have to not only export more to other Eurozone countries, but they also have to work for their products and services on selling better around the world.

null,false,besteurope,null,null,null,"&gt; Then maybe the issue is the GDP getting murdered by the austerity (the income) and not the spending ?

The problem is that the Greek GDP was ballooned by sovereign debt bubble. In 2006 the budget deficit was 5.2%, in 2007 it was 5.7%, in 2008 it was 6.5%, in 2009 it was 9.8% and in 2010 it was 15.7% of GDP. In 2010 the primary deficit, that is deficit before interest payments 9.6%. What happened that Greek governments loaned more and more money to fuel the economy, but at the end of the day it became so badly indebted that markets wouldn't anymore loan money to it. The last 5 years the Greek economy has declined. Many estimate that the Greek economy had before Syriza took power to hit the point where it would have been without the debt bubble.

&gt; Because germany as a way bigger GDP. Per capita Germany spend WAYYYYYYY more money on every citizens.

And Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Slovenia, etc... all have smaller GDP per capita than Greece and they are not complaining. The reason why Greek are feeling pressure is that they are adjusting to a lower level of GDP where they would had naturally been without the debt bubble. 

&gt; Actually no, the Troika was deciding the conditions on that one ? People were saying Varoufakis tried to negociate with the results we all know; and they started at him for 5min without moving like he insulted them, then they started repeating their conditions for ""the only possible agreement"" ? Or did i got everything wrong ?

Varoufakis didn't want to cut pensions at all. The compromise that the Juncker and Institutions came up that no pensions would be cut but EKAS would be cut. I would put my blaming finger on this to Syriza. Do remember that if pensions would be cut, it would hurt mostly ex-public workers that are also voters of Syriza.

&gt; Sorry but the fact that some countries has it worse than greek doesn't make greece's situation any better. Whether you are loan sharking and harassing the guy for a 10% or 2.5% debt is still harassing them for a debt.

The interest rates that Eurozone countries pay are extremely low. But like I said before, if Greeks don't want to even pay interests, then they can default, but that will mean the rest of the Eurozone will not be loaning them any more new money.

&gt; So according to you one of the best way to a sustainable greece debt swapping with another debt with new interests piled on top of all the pasts ones (ie more debts in the end) ? Isn't that what killed a lot of third world countries like ressource rich african nations or in southern america ?

The interest rates that Greece pays are very low, if they would be high then yes, it would be bad for Greece. The idea has constantly been that when Greece gets its economy growing the debt will start to go decrease as the interest rates are so low that inflation itself will work to decrease loans.

&gt; That however can definitely help if no further debts pile on top of it

All Eurozone countries that have loaned money have already understood that Greece will not be able to pay back its debt in any short term future. That is why Greece got relief to interest rates and maturities of loans were extended. Because of political reasons debt haven't been nominally cut. If debt would be cut, then there would be backlash in other Eurozone states that would basically shut in any new emergency loans, not to mention that it would create moral hazard for the politicians of Greece to not reform the country as debt would be anyway be cut. The fine line that Eurozone politicians are trying to walk is to make sure that Greece doesn't go bankrupt and that it starts to grow, but get as much loaned money back as possible.",null,0,null,1436879935,null,0,false,0,ct2v7w6,null,t3_3d8b3k,null,t1_ct2v7w6,null,t1_ct2uj4e,null,null,null,1437843215,null,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4,null

You can see how after joining the euro they raised their spending so much that it was so unsustainable.

If they didn't borrow so much money to create unsustainable spending that created unsustainable domestic demand. They wouldn't be in this mess.

Also compare the amount of spending relative to each citizen.

Man muss eigentlich nicht weiter lesen, um zu wissen, wie ahnungslos du bist. Der Begriff ""soziales Geschlecht"" bezieht sich gerade auf die geschlechterspezifischen Verhaltensweisen, Einstellungen und Fähigkeiten, die sich **nicht** kausal aus der Natur oder Biologie ableiten lassen. Deine Ausführungen zum sozialen Geschlecht sind also ein einziger Widerspruch und offenbaren nur deine Unkenntnis elementarer Begrifflichkeiten und Konzepte. Du bist intellektuell schlicht nicht qualifiziert, dich zum Thema zu äußern.

Genauso peinlich ist dein autoritäres Getue: ""Konsens"", ""Studie"", ""wissenschaftliche Methode"" und ""Wissenschaft"" sind keine Begriffe, die man in Diskussionen als Joker einsetzen kann, um sich vor einer inhaltlichen Auseinandersetzung zu drücken. Zeig doch mal, welche Studien deine Aussagen stützen, solange du das nicht tust, ist das alles heiße Luft.

&gt;Das kann man nicht dekonstruieren

Natürlich kann man das ""soziales Geschlecht"" dekonstruieren. Die WHO definiert soziales Geschlecht als ""the characteristics of women and men that are socially constructed, while sex refers to those that are biologically determined"". Sozial konstruierten Vorstellungen sind genauso veränderbar wie sie formbar sind. Der Aspekt kommt oftmals schon in der Definition der Begriffe ""Gender"" und ""soziales Geschlecht"" vor, z.B. hier: [Gender bezeichnet die gesellschaftlich, sozial und kulturell geprägten Geschlechtsrollen von Frauen und Männern. Diese sind - anders als das biologische Geschlecht - erlernt und damit auch veränderbar.](https://www.lzg.nrw.de/themen/Strategien/gender/)

&gt;man kann ja auch nicht Transsexuelle therapieren, so dass ihr biologisches Geschlecht mit dem psychologischen übereinstimmt.
