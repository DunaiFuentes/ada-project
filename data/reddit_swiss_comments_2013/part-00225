At the core of direct democracy is the idea that the people need to be able to pull the handbrakes at any given moment, and to every issue at hand.

On the other hand it creates an environment where no revolution is needed, since all the political instruments to change any law are on the table, no need to overthrow or kill anyone. This system has proven to be stable and as a bonus has avoided every major conflict in the last 170 or so years. 

Now what happens if you introduce a new major source of law - the EU government, that people cannot just vote away anymore? Oh, people could just vote to leave the EU in the worst case, right? I don't think so - looking around us what we see appears to be more like a hostage situation - asking people directly, they don't really want to be in the EU, but they can't leave because they're afraid of the economical consequences. As a result, local politicians won't care that much about the people's opinions anymore - if people don't like it here, they can just go to the big brother EU and let *them* introduce their favorite new law - you know, the one with lots of cherries on top for the sponsors.

true,DeepDuh,zh,Zürich,"I have to say I think it's great that you're open minded and able to engage in a meaningful and undogmatic discussion. IMO it all comes down to the idea that it's useless to have a little bit of direct democracy - it's either all or nothing.

See California as an example - it's a great economic environment and the root for a big part of the modern economy of the US - and they have a local direct democracy. But they can't do nothing about the feds 'slaying to golden goose' (the internet). On the other hand in Switzerland, if the EU (unsurprisingly) decides they have to monitor the internet as well, we can just say 'hey, thanks for all your customers, welcome everyone, our TLD is .ch, have some refreshments at the bar'. 

Edit: (Re your edit) Yes, it's true that there are economic bindings everywhere - and this is a good thing, it keeps the world a safer place than during nationalism. As you've pointed at as well - the real danger comes in when economic straps are coupled with political power over a party. The ruling party will be able to introduce new regulations that benefit them and increase their wealth even more, while the weaker party (which is usually the common people) will have to just take it and shut up (right until the situation explodes and they start murdering people). That's why I think direct democracy isn't just a nice thing to have for us, it's a necessity that in the long run (over the course of hundreds of years) will have to be introduced in every democratic country that wants to ensure political stability. The only other option I see right now, that *might* be stable in the long run, is the Chinese model - they try to couple the benefits of a capitalistic economy with the egalitarianism, but also iron strength of a communistic political system. But choosing between the two, I sure know which system I'm rooting for.

In fact I think we should hold tight and wait until the EU crumbles and then try to spread our system by offering an alternative to just start throwing nukes at each other: The 'Confoederatio Europeanum' as I like to call it. Let everyone keep their national systems, but introduce direct democracy for top level decisions for any 'CE' citizen - with our current absolute + cantonal majority as a template.

I don't like Frontex and I do think Schengen/Dublin puts an unfair share of the burden on the border countries. I want Switzerland to have a say about what's going on in Europe, because we are affected by most decisions made in Brussels. Case in point: Frontex and Schengen/Dublin.

I don't disagree so much about 'accumulate wealth in the center and starve the periphery' part. Germany has played a dubious role in the Euro-crisis. On the one hand it profits greatly from the low exchange rate of the euro (held down by the less productive countries), while it does only the necessary to keep these countries in the Euro. But you don't change that by staying out and complaining. The Swiss NFA (Neuer Finanzausgleich) would be a good model for how to deal with such a situation.

I think we're already very good at being parasites. We have Pauschalsteuer für Ausländer, lower taxes for foreign companies than for Swiss, we have Glencore, Trafigura, Vitol and Xstrata (someone should make a song, these names have certain ring to them), and Bankgeheimnis. We send hand grenades to the Arab Emirates that end up in Syria. I mean we're fucking good at it.

Apart from that. London is the future. In the sense that globalisation in the 21st century gravitates towards the centres, the cities. And yes, Greece f.e. may be too far away to be more than a tourist destination. We're very lucky that we're in the thriving economic zone that stretches from London to Milan.

From 3 February to Ash Wednesday masked “Tschäggätta” parade through the villages of the Lötschental in the canton of Valais. These masked figures get their name from the black and white colour of the goat or sheep skin tunics that they traditionally wear (“tschäggätta” means piebald in the local dialect).
The tradition was originally a courtship ritual practiced only by the local bachelors. Times have changed and now anyone can join in. For the deeply religious inhabitants of the Lötschen valley, these distinctive and somewhat demonic-looking masks represented anarchy, rebellion and chaos.
