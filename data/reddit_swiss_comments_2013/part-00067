I wanted to experience another culture but didn't want to sacrifice the reputation of the education. The tuition is low compared to the US and the money you spend is put towards a very high quality of living instead.
wrt PhD, a Swiss MSc did not hurt my chances of getting into a very good program. I did have pretty good undergrad research (probable interpretation: North American) and work at an international organization.
A caveat would be that if you change your mind and want to start your professional career in Switzerland, you might run into some problems. I seriously considered staying in CH. I passed first round interviews at several firms only to later find out that they weren't willing to go through the work permit application.
