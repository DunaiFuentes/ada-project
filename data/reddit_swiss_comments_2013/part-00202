Here is what I think to each point :

* This is surely the most important but also the more complex to solve I think. I really think we won't have 10% of the EPFL here. At least not at start. I think that before trying to find a solution to a problem that will appear later, we should first focus on making people go on that subreddit. And that we should do this in two times : First get people that already use reddit go on our subreddit, then convaince people that don't use reddit that it might be useful (and talk to them about our subreddit).
The problem I see with doing either of your solutions now is that it will retain people from coming here and getting involved with stuff. I don't say that these ideas are bad, but I'm convainced we should wait that more people come here before trying to limit things. Why not simply ask what these epfl/redditors prefer once we have like 100 subscribers ?

* I think we should go for option 1. There are enough places where people can learn things and keep up with EPFL's public stuff. I really think it'd be awesome if this became a place where people from here talk about casual meta stuff. But I think posting important public news will be encouraged too as the commentary section will be interesting to see :)

* I think we should just give honorary flair to ""special"" people like teachers and people that are recognized by a large majority of the EPFL as important entities like AGEpoly and let things flow naturally from this. We don't know how this will evole, we can just act by the time things happen.

* Totally agree on the last point. Aybe we should simply post things here at start, invite our friends, talk to people we know about this subreddit and then when we'll have an -even little- active community then contact AGEpoly or smth like this. :) But we shouldn't wait too much to do this either, I think.",0,1380268531,null,0,false,0,ccgba1k,t3_1n8cwv,t1_ccgba1k,t3_1n8cwv,null,1429327483,1,false,EPFL,t5_2svyx,1
true,Aethec,ba-in,null,"Let's talk about flairs.

First, there are two flairs that we can let users set - BA and MA students.  
Here are the possible BA / MA units and their availability: 

* **AR** - Architecture (Architecture), BA / MA
* **CGC** - Chimie et génie chimique (Chemistry and Chemical Engineering), BA / MA
* **EL** - Génie électrique et électronique (Electrical and Electronical Engineering), BA / MA
* **GC** - Génie civil (Civil Engineering), BA / MA
* **GM** - Génie mécanique (Mechanical Engineering), BA / MA
* **IN** - Informatique (Computer Science), BA / MA
* **MA** - Mathématiques (Mathematics), BA / MA
* **MT** - Microtechnique (Microtechnics), BA / MA
* **MX** - Science et génie des matériaux (Materials Science and Engineering), BA / MA
* **PH** - Physique (Physics), BA / MA
* **SC** - Systèmes de Communication (Communication Systems), BA / MA
* **SIE** - Sciences et ingénierie de l'environnement (Environmental Sciences and Engineering), BA / MA
* **SV** - Sciences et technologies du vivant (Life, Sciences and Technologies), BA / MA
* **EME** - EPFL Middle East (Middle East EPFL), MA
* **IF** - Ingénierie financière (Financial Engineering), MA
* **MGT** - Managenent de la technologie et de l'ingénierie financière (Management of Technology and Financial Engineering), MA
* **MTE** - Management de la technologie (Management of Technology and Entrepreneurship), MA

Then there are the PhDs. I'm not sure we should let people claim they're PhD students (or postdocs) without some sort of authentication. Here are the PhD schools (some of which do not have a name in French):

* **EDAR** - Architecture &amp; Sciences de la ville (Architecture &amp; Sciences of the City)
* **EDBB** - Biotechnology &amp; Bioengineering
* **EDCE** - Génie civil et environnement (Civil and Environmental Engineering)
* **EDCH** - Chimie et génie chimique (Chemistry and Chemical Engineering)
* **EDEE** - Génie électrique (Electrical Engineering)
* **EDEY** - Energie (Energy)
* **EDFI** - Finance (Finance)
* **EDIC** - Informatique, communications et information (Computer, Communication and Information Sciences)
* **EDMA** - Mathématiques (Mathematics)
* **EDME** - Mechanics
* **EDMI** - Microsystèmes et microélectronique (Microsystems and Microelectronics)
* **EDMS** - Approches Moléculaires du Vivant (Molecular Life Sciences)
* **EDMT** - Management of Technology
* **EDMX** - Science et Génie des Matériaux (Material Science and Engineering)
* **EDNE** - Neurosciences (Neuroscience)
* **EDPO** - Photonique (Photonics)
* **EDPR** - Systèmes de production et robotique (Manufacturing Systems and Robotics)
* **EDPY** - Physique (Physics)

Then there are the many teaching positions. These shouldn't be set by the users but requested by email using some sort of authentication (the e-mail address can be spoofed unfortunately) for teachers who want to participate in this sub.

There are also some special positions like delegates, AGEPOLY members, POLYLAN organisers, President (why not? :) ), and so forth. Again, some strong authentication is needed.",0,1380272223,null,0,false,0,ccgbpgn,t3_1n8cwv,t1_ccgbpgn,t3_1n8cwv,null,1429327283,1,false,EPFL,t5_2svyx,1
