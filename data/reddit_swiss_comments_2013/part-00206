Unless we live in a totalitarian system (and probably even then), prohibition JUST.DOES.NOT.WORK. It does not help to keep drugs out of the hands of people who really want/need them. Obviously we do not want a totalitarian system so we just have to accept: REPRESSION DOES NOT SOLVE THE DRUG PROBLEM (as demonstrated, again, in recent news).

Everything has been tried. With alcohol. With tobacco. With weed. With cocaine. With heroin. With all sorts of hallucinogenics. It did not work. It never worked. The stuff still gets produced and it still gets shiped and it still gets sold. On the penalty of death (in some countries).

So what do we do? We obviously still have a problem. Two problems, to be exact.

One problem are the drug addicts themselves, or at least does addicts that present as burden to society (there are lots very well functioning addicts of all kinds). The second problem is to keep the stuff out of the hands of youths who we deem not yet responsible enough to make the decision to take a certain drug or not. How do you solve these two problems?
 
The answer is of course so obvious it hurts.

Legalization.

This will remove (at least partially) the social stigma of addicts (in that you do not ciminalize them), allowing them more easily to admit to their problem and get help. You solve a large part of the first problem. Yes, some we still will not be able to help. But they (usually those that were broken way before they began their drug use) would be beyond help regardless of what we do.

In regard to youths, legalization will remove access to drugs from large parts of the youth. Yes, some will always be able to get their hands on it, the same as with alcohol. But it will be more difficult if there is no black market available that will sell to anyone (I don't think there is a big black market to especially sell alcohol to kids, now is there).

In one fell swoop you come to the best possible outcome. It is not perfect, it cannot be. But it olves the two core problems with drugs and it does that without uneccessairily punishing all those who just want (and are able to) use drugs recreationally as they should be free to do.",0,1380726256,null,0,false,0,ccjjtx4,t3_1njdix,t1_ccjjtx4,t1_ccj5gff,null,1429271093,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4

Hier kommt auch das Prinzip der [Direkten Demokratie](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direkte_Demokratie) zum Tragen - wenn eine Partei im Parlament zu wenig Stimmen hat um etwas bestimmtes durchzuboxen bzw. zu verhindern kann sie das Volk entscheiden lassen (sofern sie genügend Unterschriften sammeln kann) und hat somit eine Möglichkeit sich trotzdem durchzusetzen. 

Kleinere Nichtregierungsparteien (National z.B. die Grünen, kantonal sehr viele weitere) haben keinen Anreiz sich mit einer Opposition querzustellen. Erstens sind sie stimmenmässig hoffnungslos unterlegen,  zweitens würden sie sämtliche parlamentarische Möglichkeiten verlieren (Komissionen, Ausschüsse etc) und drittens hat der schweizer Bürger historisch betrachtet destruktives Verhalten stets abgestraft oder zumindest nicht belohnt - man kann sich also keinen Wählerzulauf erhoffen.
