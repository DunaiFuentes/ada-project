true,DeepBlueNemesis,bs,Beide Basel,"We've had a thread about Buepf [a while ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1f4tkz/buepfch_nein_zum_%C3%BCberwachungsstaat_jetzt_petition/), it has nothing to do with creating another institution.

It is possible (though far from certain) that our government is still keeping a hidden database based on some criteria. I am however 100% certain that it's nowhere close to the size of the NSA scandal in the US. The ""We might have spies""-mentality that caused the Fichenscandal is long gone, it's more likely that they're monitoring people who come in regular contact with shady foreigners (think money laundering). I highly doubt that any sort of large (or even medium) scale monitoring program would have survived the last decade considering all the people who were head of the EJPD and how different their moral compass was form one another (Metzler, Blocher, Widmer-Schlumpf, Sommaruga).",0,1370854301,null,0,false,0,cafseou,t3_1g0j5j,t1_cafseou,t1_cafr08i,null,1430863683,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

Art. 2 Organisation

1 Der Bund betreibt einen Dienst für die Überwachung des Post- und Fernmeldeverkehrs (Dienst).

2 Der Dienst erfüllt seine Aufgaben selbstständig. Er ist weisungsungebunden und dem zuständigen Departement nur administrativ unterstellt.

3 Der Dienst arbeitet im Rahmen seiner Aufgaben mit den im Post- und Fernmeldewesen zuständigen Konzessions- und Aufsichtsbehörden zusammen.

IMO, as far as I can see, this ""Dienst"" is the really new thing about the new Büpf. Everything else (again, as far as I can see, I'm no lawyer but interested in these developments) is already being done.

Most of the jobs do require some form of IT degree (Depending on the job, either an apprenticeship diploma (Switzerland has a dual education system), a degree from a university of applied science or a degree from a university. That being said, there definitely **are** job listings that require a degree or a flair for IT. Some job listings also state something in the form of ""degree or X years or experience"". 

&gt; And would it be feasible to find a swiss employer that would sponser me to get the required credentials while I work?

Yes and no. Going to University might not be feasible because of time issues. Universities of applied sciences however allow you to study part time while working 80% or so. Now I really don't know the specifics considering your unique situation, but usually the government pays for university costs and you only have to pay a symbolic fee of a 1000 SFr.- or so per semester. So you don't actually need the company to sponsor you, you just need to get a job that allows you to work 80%.

&gt; But unfortunately my university degree is not in a field that is directly related IT, so I am trying to figure out if there is any way to do this that doesn't require me to go back to school for years before I can get a job. 

Having an interest in IT and having know how in a different field is good - you could work for a consulting company (PwC, Deloitte, .. you name it)

&gt; Is a CS degree generally a prerequisite for those jobs? 

No. The HR drones put all kinds of stuff there that would be an ideal candidate which only exists in HR-fairy land. I've applied and got a job that usually takes 5 different skillsets and twice the salary - and didn't actually do half of what was in the job description. Anything that isn't an absolute must - don't worry about it. Chances are that they have trouble finding someone.

""Needs a degree in IT or similar experience"" is often used. It just means: ""Can do IT stuff, the guys interviewing you will figure that out"" ([see here](https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=1565001&amp;))

(I disagree with /u/byacasha here - but only regarding consulting companies. I've dealt with some of those large consulting companies - they don't care about your degree. They interview you, they put you in boot camp for a few weeks, they look at your performance there and then you're either good to go or good to go away).
