My family, which admittedly I've only seen once lives near st gallen in watville. What kind of salary do engineers make over there and would lifestyle be similar to being Ann engineer in the states?

My husband is a chemist, so not quite the same, but both times he's had to look for a job he didn't have much trouble. I think the first time it took him around a month to find a job, and the second time it took him a few weeks and he had more than one job offer that time. He did not attend university either, so no degree (he did an apprenticeship at a pharmaceutical company iirc). His salary was ok with his first job, nothing spectacular, but his salary now is fairly good. He works now in a small place called Wolhusen, in canton Luzern, and previously worked near St. Gallen. As far as salary goes I'm not sure how different a chemical engineer would be but my husband makes slightly over 90k CHF/year right now. 

&gt; 2) how would you rate quality of life in Switzerland besides a few differences like lack of 24 hour culture etc and convenience that embodies America.

Life here is a LOT different vs. being in America. Of course, I think it depends heavily on what area you live in- for example, living in or close to Zurich might resemble living in the US a bit more, but living farther away from the major cities is much much different. I personally heavily prefer Switzerland (although everyone I meet always seems stunned to hear it lol) but I think it depends on your personality and what you enjoy doing. It's cleaner, safer, healthcare is far and away better (in my experience, having gone through pregnancy, childbirth, emergency care, and surgery here so far) although expensive. Food is much more expensive, especially eating out, even fast food (when you can find it...). As someone else touched on the variety of food here really sucks too although I think in Zurich at least there are plenty of specialty shops and a better variety of restaurants. In my town however there are 3 restaurants and they all have exactly the same menu...not that the food is bad, but there aren't Mexican restaurants, Italian restaurants, Chinese restaurants, etc. 

Everything seems more expensive here but then again I think most salaries here are higher than they would be in the US. ",0,1384339902,null,0,false,0,cdd9lm2,t3_1q6tke,t1_cdd9lm2,t3_1q6tke,null,1428678751,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
