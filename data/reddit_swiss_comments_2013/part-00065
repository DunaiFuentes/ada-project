Also, the US is pretty vast and quite culturally diverse itself...between Louisiana and Montana you're probably going to find the same level of cultural difference as you would find between ""average"" America and Switzerland.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Check out [English Forum Switzerland](http://www.englishforum.ch).  I'll give you the summarized version:

Religion:  Christianity is the dominant religion, but you do not have real ""fundamentalists"" the way you do in the US.  Religion is very rarely discussed in private conversation, and atheists and agnostics are *much* more common there than in the US.  An estimated 17-27% of the population does not believe in god.

Rules:  Many.  Switzerland is not laid back by any means, expect huge fines for things as simple as not separating the trash and recycling bags properly, you make not make noise on Sundays or during certain hours of other days that disturbs others, and this is strictly enforced.  I'm not kidding.  

Switzerland is said to be more ""conservative"" politically compared to other European countries, but from a US perspective, they are far to the left than US democrats.  Even the right-wing SVP is to the left of Obama excepting many things except perhaps immigration.  There are no serious arguments about social safety nets or abortion, no one is trying to get creationism introduced in schools.

Sanctions for personal behavior can be large.  If you are caught doing things outside accepted social norms (parking illegally even if you're in the car, doing laundry in the common room on the wrong day), there will be consequences from ordinary citizens, not just police.  Hang out in that forum for a bit and you can read expat tales of such adventures.

The Swiss do not have a ""consumer culture"" like that of the US.  Most shops and restaurants still close on Sundays there, and many shops and restaurants do close early.  ""24-hour"" anything is not the norm there.

From a cultural perspective, the Swiss do not ""make friends"" instantly as you can in the US.  If you try and strike up a conversation with someone on the street or in an elevator you will get a very brief response, or get stared at as if you were from Mars.  It is not as bad as Norway, but it takes much more time to make friends there than in the US.  On the flipside, friendships in Switzerland are much more meaningful once made.

In short - if you like rules, cleanliness, and can handle learning one of Switzerland's four official languages (French, Italian, Swiss German, or Romansh) and don't need a ton of space, Switzerland is for you.  If you haven't visited yet, you should do so as they do love tourists.

One last thing, as with other European countries, if you are an American that would like to move there, make sure you have a unique skill that can get you hired over any EU applicant -- if you can't do this and don't have an EU passport, your chances of getting in are very slim.",0,1365133803,null,0,1365133990,0,c98tzdi,t3_1bpi7i,t1_c98tzdi,t3_1bpi7i,null,1431667713,26,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,26

Switzerland has a very high minimum wage - something like 18 CHF which is comparable to USD or CAD. 
EDIT: whoops, I guess it isn't legalized - however that's what I've always read so I would assume that not making a decent wage just isn't a problem there. 

Switzerland doesn't have the NHS, but neither does Canada not Germany. It is universal in that everyone is obligated to pay for insurance which is tightly controlled and if unable, the govt. subsidizes. 

As for Montana and Louisiana, they may technically speak the same language but that doesn't mean they are culturally identical. Also, they don't as Cajun can be spoken there. Language only plays so much of a role.
