Good article in 'der Bund' today. I quote Prof. Schaefer (con law): 
&gt;Beim «Tanz dich frei»-Umzug von morgen Samstag sei der Verzicht auf das Einholen einer Bewilligung aber Teil des jugendlichen Protestes. Für eine Veranstaltung, die sich gegen die staatliche Reglementierung des Nachtlebens einsetze, sei dies verständlich. Das Beharren auf einem Bewilligungsgesuch hätte bei «Tanz dich frei» wenig gebracht, da die Organisatoren ja bekannt gegeben hätten, welche Route sie benützen wollten, sagt Schefer.
&gt;
&gt;«Es gibt schlicht keine Alternative»
&gt;
&gt;Das Bewilligungsverfahren sei ein sinnvolles Instrument, um im Vorfeld einer Kundgebung die verschiedenen Interessen bei der Nutzung des öffentlichen Grund und Bodens zu koordinieren. Eine Versammlung werde aber nicht insgesamt illegal, wenn kein richtiges Bewilligungsverfahren durchgeführt werde. «Die Illegalität beschränkt sich auf einen bewussten Verstoss gegen die Bewilligungsvorschriften.»
&gt;
&gt;Dabei handle es sich um ein vergleichsweise geringes Vergehen. Daher könne eine Kundgebung nicht bloss deswegen aufgelöst werden, weil keine Bewilligung vorliege. «Es bleibt den Behörden nichts anderes übrig, als aus der Situation das Beste zu machen. Es gibt schlicht keine Alternative», sagt Schefer. Die Leute würden nun mal zu Tausenden vor Ort erscheinen.""

And the real problem here is that they don't want to communicate and take responsibility which I think is the wrong approach for an event like that.

Also, what do the people say who suffer from the noise and litter? Do you think they have been asked if they want a giant party in-front of their house?

So, when you hand in the request for the demonstration the authorities check whether you are violent or not?:D Come on, how are they gonna do it?

EDIT: So if the permit is to prevent violent acts, tell me, why did demonstrations escalate in the past? Mistake of the authorities then, right?

Demonstrations need a 'Bewilligung für gesteigerten Gemeingebrauch', this is legit as far as the base right (Art. 22 BV) goes, but it has to be compatible with the normal use of said public grounds and the base rights of other peoples. Tanz dich frei looks appropriate to me concerning these issues.

I'm told that they take responsibilty. Where exactly is your problem?

Yeah, the people who suffer from the litter. It's for one morning for god's sake. I'm sure they get eye cancer, because quite frankly there are a lot of people who haven't seen litter in their whole life. Oh my god!

The party is in the centre of the city, not only do very few people actually live there, but that's the deal if you want to settle there. If you were to prohibit said event because of the noise, then vice versa it's egoistic from the housing people. One day/year seems fair to me. But hey, I'm sure the noise will also make their life a living hell.

Keyword is anonym! They can't take responsibility for anything that is going to happen when nobody knows who it is.
""If you were to prohibit said event because of the noise, then vice versa it's egoistic from the housing people."" No, because they can't do anything about it because it's no legal event. That means there was no democratic chance for them to do something against it.
And what seems fair to you has no actual influence on the topic. There is a law. If it would be a peaceful demonstration that is organized to deliver a message it would be ok if they had a permit.
But if they just come to party, make noise and litter then there isn't much to it.

In my opinion taking responsibility means that they look out for medics, check getaways etc., or what kind of responsibility does one take when he reveals himself as organizer of an event? He puts a picture to himself, then what? As I mentioned earlier, he's NOT liable for damages! 

Besides, just so that you know you as an individual cannot appeal against a permit for a demonstration! Tell me what legal way would the housing people have? What democratic chance? There is no way by law! You don't think that events like the first of May could take place when every individual in the city would be allowed to appeal, do you? If you in fact were able to appeal against a permit of a demonstration on all three instances till the Bundesverwaltungsgericht you would have to hand in the request three, I repeat, THREE years before the demonstration in order to guarantee it's implementation. Because it's how long it takes them to serve justice.
