If you were a married couple, you would be required by law to support one another, so if one part earns enough to support both, you can get a visa.

Since you're not married, you are not legally obligated to support one another, so you'd need some other way to guarantee that you will support your SO. I'm not aware of a way to do this, sadly, but try contacting the immigration authorities of the canton you would likely end up moving to, and asking them.
