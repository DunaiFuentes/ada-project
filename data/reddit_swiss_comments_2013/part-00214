So she chases the cats around a lot.  Our youngest one not so much.  He's so kind and gentle with them, and will lay down and whine if they don't pay him any attention.  Because they've obviously been around the older one longer they don't really give our puppy the time of day.  So it's really kinda random I guess how they will react to your cats.  
  
As for dying young and health problems, yes they do exist.  If you feed them a good diet of quality grain free food or even raw food you could possibly extend their life.  But a lot of the illnesses unfortunately are hereditary.  Hip and elbow displaysia, cancer and tumors are unfortunately common in this breed.  Buying from a good breeder that does genetic testing and hip and elbow testing will help you with these things.  Also recommended is no regular exercise until they are 6 months old (I mean like long walks and hikes).  Since they're large breed they grow really fast and don't really stop growing until they're 2 years old.  
  
They also take longer to mature than smaller breed dogs.  They can express puppy like tendencies until they are 3.  We're still waiting for our 2 year old to ""calm down"" a bit.  
  
They are also very much people dogs.  They want to be around their people ALL THE TIME.  So if your parents are busy bodies and don't spend much time at home, then this might not be the best dog for them.  I have seen my dogs be protective, but not aggressive.  If they think a stranger is in the house they will bark, and it's not a nice bark.  Would definitely scare someone away I think.

true,drpastry,null,null,"Wow, Berners are awesome!  You might have some additional luck with posting this to /r/bernesemountaindogs as well. 

My husband and I started researching the breed a year ago to determine if it was exactly what we were going for and now are about to pick up our 8 week old girl in just six days.  We've spent a lot of time with Berners in the meantime.  Bernese Mountain Dogs really seem to bring people together and there are tons of communities everywhere that get together regularly just to meet one another and talk about their Berners. This would be a great experience for parents who are, for example, experiencing a newly ""empty nest"".

Bernese are known, like PeacheyPie mentioned, for being friendly and are not exactly at all what you would call watch dogs.  A Berner might get upset by the presence of an intruder and let out a bark, but the dogs aren't terribly much for barking.  They're not really protective, quite honestly.  Intimidating, though, sure.  As long as you aren't counting on the dog actually being aggressive, they'd do the job.

We have two cats and finding a breed that does well with other animals has meant a lot to us.  Berners are actually known for their wonderful animal-friendly nature and do great with working or playing alongside other animals like cats and horses. 

I know, like PeacheyPie mentioned, from experience that these dogs are actually puppyish with their behavior for the first few years, so maturing is slow, though they get big fast.  The boys are substantially bigger than the girls as well.

I can echo that they are very much people dogs and will definitely get lonely if not kept company much.  I, for example, elected to start working from home more frequently in order to keep our puppy company in her first year.  This was very much the plan, though, because one of the greater reasons for adding onto our family was to put some space between my work and family.  I understand that many people spend too much time away from home to really be the kind of owner that a Berner needs.

Before looking further, a fun and educational thing that you might do is to watch the 8 minute [Dogs 101 video on YouTube about Bernese Mountain Dogs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgb_cGN2VDE) which goes over the spectrum of details (health concerns, behavior, size, etc.).

Once you're ready to really dig into learning the specifics, [this site](http://www.bmdinfo.org/index.php) has been immeasurably helpful.  

One thing I will definitely remind you is that finding a good, reputable breeder makes a world of difference when it comes to the health and overall life expectancy of your dog.  This is crucial.  Don't, definitely don't, be cheap. Well-bred pups (think healthy!) cost anywhere between $1500 and $1800.  If you're talking with someone who is charging a lot less, something is probably up.
