Other than that, as far as I know an emergency passport is only issued in emergency situations. You can try to apply for one, but I'm not sure that not renewing your passport in time is considered an emergency.

[tcs](http://www.tcs.ch/de/reisen-camping/reiseinfos/reiseziele.php) offers quite detailed entry requirements for basically any country of our dear planet. these are fairly accurate, but when i doubt you can still call an embassy or browse the web for more information.

to enter sweden, you need a valid passport or identity card.

new biometric documents are guaranteed to be delivered in 10 work days. in my experience, it never took longer than 3 days till they arrived at the office or the customers home. so an appointment on the 21. COULD work out just fine. **just bring all the documents required by your passbüro.**

about the emergency passport: every passport office can print you one of these. basel and zurich are just the only airports who are also capable to do so - adding an extra CHF 50.-- to the regular price of CHF 100.--. the notpass is only valid for one single flight, so do not be surprised if it gets voided at the swiss border.

my recommendation would be to do the following:

* take the appointment on the 21. tell them that you want to pick up your  new papers there and maybe ask them to call you as soon as they arrive. 

* the day before your flight (or the morning before, depends on your departure) check by the passport office/let them call you. if they do have them yay - if not, ask for an emergency passport. it takes usually 30 to 60 minutes to get one of those printed. you can pick them up right away. you will need to get another picture taken though, as they are not allowed by law to use the previous photo in their database.

best case: you pay CHF 158.-- for passport and identity card and can make your flight.

worst case: you pay CHF 258.-- for regular documents and your emergency passport and can make your flight.

in any case - you don't need to worry about your papers anymore for ten long years.

hope that helps.

I know my fair share of politicians on both a local and a national scale due to a previous job I've held. And when they talk about the places and people I know, I usually get the impression that they're talking about some alternate version of them, some fantasy version. And they're politicking for those people, those constructs and statistics. More often than not, the actual people kind of don't factor into it. But that's okay, as the political landscape has allowed itself to get that far by being rather good.

You see, Switzerland doesn't face many of the issues the rest of the world faces. Because the little country tackled them with the sole thought of ""How can we make this at least work within tolerable parameters for everyone?"" Naturally, some people are always displeased with everything and there's a solid 40 percent that will vote ""No"", regardless of what is being propagated, but for a majority, things work out. And more often than not, when such an issue arises, politicians hunker down and figure out a middle road. It's not about propagating agendas as much as making it work. This is more evident on a local level where political affiliation is more an afterthought than anything.

That being said, the system is horribly inefficient and I often wonder how anything ever got done. For any given task, there is an insane amount of consideration and paper-pushing necessary. And also, due to some legal loophole, a certain matter can be put to vote multiple times. Thus a ""No"" doesn't necessarily mean ""No"". Switzerland's joining the EU is one of these matters. Every five years someone comes along and goes ""Hey, guys, you know about this EU-thing? Let's join it!"" and it's always an overwhelming ""No"" for an answer. Naturally, the whole preparation of the vote, the paroles and texts and regulations are worked out beforehand. So it's time wasted. Because after a vote, let's say the country decides to join the EU (funny, right?), all these texts get revised and adapted to the aforementioned principle of ""How can this work for everyone?""

The system, needless to say, is also uncomprehensibly complicated and full of details and loopholes.

Bundesbern (the government) works pretty well together, even though they have the occasional spat about this or that or a public laughing fit about dried meat or horses. Local and cantonal borders mean very little in every day life and on a government level, they're becoming less and less important, leading to a mass fusing of villages, cities and communes.

Upsides: Those are responsible who are affected. If my city has a problem with waste management, my city has the power to change things. We do not have to wait for Bern to say it's OK.

The biggest interesting thing in Switzerland is the popular initiative, and it has some features that contrast with other countries.

• It's a parlement based system. That means that the most important election is not by majority, but by proportion. That is something very important, as it gives the opportunity for a lot of political groups to participate, and to give very various positions. Whereas in majority system, there are mainly two sides opposing frontally (democrats vs republicans in the US, UMP vs PS in France, etc.).

• The election to the government is indirect. People don't vote for the government, the Parlement does. That means that, instead of big lobbys and marketings plots in the election, there are at most political plots. That's really a better choice.

• The government is composed of 7 ""Federal Counselor""  which are representatives of the strength of the political groups and the geography of the country. Those 7 person have to support each other, any decision taken must be defended as a personal decision, whatever they really think. And they have time. Most of the time, they stay in the government as long as they don't quit. It has happened that a Counselor wasn't reelected, but it's really really rare. Contrary to ""majority system"" country, where there are some great improvement, and then some steps backs, Switzerland is a turtle that slowly moves forward, but never goes backward. (Well, most of the time, of course)

• The democracy is direct nonetheless, thanks to the ""Referendum"" and ""Initiative"" rights. Referendum : if more than 50'000 peoples disagree with a law voted by the parlement, there must be a vote about this law. Initiative : if more than 100'000 peoples want a modification of the constitution, there must be a vote about this modification.

Sorry, but that's wrong. The fundamental principal on this matter is article 3 of our constitution.

&gt;The Cantons are sovereign except to the extent that their sovereignty is limited by the Federal Constitution. They shall exercise all rights that are not vested in the Confederation.

It's not a case by case decision, a ''those are responsible who are affected'' principle, something that we can ''chose to ignore'' or even worse, decide things on several levels simultaneously (like in France). It's something extremely important. 

Here's the Wiki part so I don't have to describe it myself:

&gt;The Swiss Federal Constitution declares the cantons to be sovereign to the extent their sovereignty is not limited by federal law.[4] The cantons also retain all powers and competencies not delegated to the Confederation by the Constitution. Most significantly, the cantons are responsible for healthcare, welfare, law enforcement and public education; they also retain the power of taxation. The cantonal constitutions determine the degree of autonomy accorded to the municipalities, which varies but almost always includes the power to levy taxes and pass municipal laws.
