true,anonlymouse,be,Bern,"For wrestling there are 3 main types that you're likely to be aware of.

There's Greco-Roman, which was never practiced by the Greeks or the Romans, as far as I can tell it's actually french. It's upper body only. You're not allowed to use your legs beyond staying up and moving, and you're not allowed to touch their legs either. When it's good, it's characterised by awesome high amplitude throws. When it's bad it's the most boring crap ever (which likely contributed to it getting knocked off the Olympic schedule and has FILA fighting).

Freestyle is the other international style, it developed out of Catch as Catch Can wrestling, in which anything was allowed, and you could win by pin-fall or by catch (submission). Freestyle is that, but with no submissions. You're allowed to do pretty much anything you can think of if it's not likely to cause injury. Emphasis is on takedowns, not much matwork.

In the US there's Folkstyle wrestling which is very similar to Freestyle, but the rules favour matwork, so while Freestyle and Greco generally are like Judo and stop when it hits the ground, Folkstyle is characterised by scrambles, which makes for much more exciting viewing (and much more practical skill development in a fight).

Sumo has elements of Freestyle and Greco, and nothing of Folkstyle. You win either by ring out or by forcing your opponent to touch anything other than their feet or their hair bun on the ground. There are no pins, because the match has already been won long before you could work for the pin. Because of the belt, there's a lot of that.

Schwingen has elements of Freestyle and Sumo - you're allowed to use your legs, but because you have to start in a clinch grabbing the pants it has a stance more like Greco, and of course grabbing the pants is like grabbing the belt in Sumo. There isn't as much ground work as there is in Folkstyle, but the refs also won't stand the match up as quickly as in Freestyle and Greco.

Schwingen doesn't have any scoring in the way Freestyle, Folkstyle and Greco do. It's pretty much you either win, you lose, or you draw. I'm not clear on how the scoring esec mentioned works, but you can tell if one guy has his back covered in sawdust, then he lost.

I find Schwingen and Sumo to be much more spectator friendly than Freestyle, Greco and Folkstyle. The scoring in the latter 3 lead to some pretty bizarre strategies, while in Sumo and Schwingen you can always tell what they're working towards and don't have to wonder if there's some rule detail that they're using to win.",0,1377141871,null,0,false,0,cbsrrm2,t3_1kfw5e,t1_cbsrrm2,t1_cbovgod,null,1429743844,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
