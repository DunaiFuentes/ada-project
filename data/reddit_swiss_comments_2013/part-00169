Schwingen is similar to wrestling, but: you need to have (at least) one hand on you oponends belt at all times. You try to get them on their backs (both shoulders on the ground/ im Sägmehl).

The match is reset, when both fighters loose their grip or one of them leaves the ring.

At the end they get marks: 

10 or 9.75 for winning

9 or 8.75 for a tie

8.75 or 8.5 for loosing
