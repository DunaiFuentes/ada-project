The initiative created a discourse as always and most people didn't find the general idea behind the 1:12 initiative bad, but the initiative itself. As mentioned in the article, the attention the topic got through the campaign might very well lead to a less extreme measure in the future.

For now we have the Minder Initiative which will start taking effect in the new year. This'll show if the owners of the company will put a stop to undeserved salaries. Also it's very well possible to raise taxes for the rich. This would help counter act the inequality as well.

The Highway Initiative was just a little change, but the rejection reflects the overall problems the Swiss have with how we handle finances around our national streets. There will be other solutions, like higher taxes on gas.

For the Family Initiative I'm glad it got denied. Making the tax code more obscure and illogical doesn't make sense and neither does the argument to get rid of either tax break.
