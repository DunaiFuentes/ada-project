true,nihiriju,world,Canada,"Hi, I am a Canadian doing my Master degree at Bern University of Applied Sciences. 

- School fees per term are just under 1000CHF regardless of how many classes you take.

- Each program is different, but you should have enough time to work part time or even full time.

- It is relatively easy to get a job with the University, specially if you were doing sciences. Research assistant jobs pay around 24 CHF/hr for usually 20 hours/ week. Netting a monthly income of roughly 2,000 CHF. This is easily enough to live on.  (I live very tightly on 1500 CHF/month)

- Getting your VISA suuuuuucks. It sucks a lot. I think I had to go to 4 or 5 different sessions and it costs me roughly 500 CHF. If you have a better handler then you should only have to get stuff done 3 times and it would costs roughly 320 CHF for 1 year. Each year after is 127 CHF for type B permit ( You would likely get this kind which allows work/study).

- You can easily bike around many places, the bike infrastructure is a million times better than what I have seen in Canada or the US. Although you will likely want to use public transit in the winter when it snows. (Not so much snow, but some days are inhospitable to cycling.)

If you have any other questions let me know. 
It would be great to know German before you come, but unfortunately Swiss German is extremely different sounding. It will be difficult no matter what. You should also check out where the campus you would be studying at is...they are not all in Bern. Mine is in Biel / Bienne where the city is bilingual, half speaking French. The French here is actually easier than Quebecois or pure French as people tend to pronounce fully and speak very slowly. I am learning high German, but when I practice it in public people simply answer in English. 

Coming from the west cost of Canada the cost of living here is actually cheaper for me except in one department; restaurants are insanely expensive and for my tastes not very good.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm an American military member, I'm looking at trying to gain Swiss citizenship after I retire in ten years. I realize that will be a long road, but I think it's worth it. For what it's worth, I'm no libertarian. I do own 2 guns but I'm not attached to them, they're fun to go out and shoot once every year or so, but other than that they stay locked up. I'm not one that thinks I'm special in any way for being American. And I don't want to escape ""the current administration,"" I'm just really frustrated at the fact that my choices are either the current administration or one that would be extremely religious, gun-crazed, and anti-social-safety-net. I will be spending at least 6 of my last 10 years in the military in Germany, so I hope to assimilate well enough to become fluent in German and comfortable with the understandably different lifestyle of Europe, particularly around lower Germany and the Zurich area of Switzerland. 

And I understand why these posts exist. Because we have a very vocal group (that I wish were a minority, but they are a hefty portion of the population) that believe in ""god and guns and 'Murica!"" They may not be the biggest group, but they are a loud one, and they seem to drown out the more neutral or even social groups on the other sides.
