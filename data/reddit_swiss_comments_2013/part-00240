true,Gardelune,vd,Vaud,"So I might be able to help a bit with n°1. I am a chemist, not a chem eng, and I'm near the end of my PhD so not yet completely immersed in the job market, but:

Concerning how easy it is to get a job: not that easy. People who studied chem eng and graduated the same year as I did had quite some trouble finding a job. They all did, in the end, but it took some time (4-6 month on average). If you don't speak French or German, it will probably make it even more difficult.

On the plus side, salary is good. If you have a master, you can expect around 80k/year as a starting salary.

Concerning localisation, Basel has a very high density of chemical industry. Lausanne and Genève have more biotech. Not sure about Zürich. There are also a few companies in Monthey.

* **Better butchers:** the butchers around my town could be a lot better. The best part is that there's an excellent butcher right on the other side of the border which buys cows from the farmers in the neighbourhood, and is by far the best around here. 

* **real tea in restaurants:** If you charge a fuckload, you could at least serve real tea instead of a dusty old bag that lied on the shelf for years. I can see how it wouldn't be worth it in restaurants, but there's hardly one coffe/tea house that sells somthing different than hot water with teabags.

* **Higher speed limits:** scientists at the TU Berlin calculated that the speed which allows for most effective traffic is 90km/h. 80km/h doesn't make sense, it's just a random number somebody picked because he felt like it's a good idea. Turns out he was wrong.

* **Put the discounts in one place:** My nearby Migros puts everything that has a discount in one central place. This way around everybody can easily check if there's something he could use instead of searching the whole Migros, and the company has less stuff they must throw away because it's expired. Everybody wins, why isn't it standard?

* **Reorganize the gun law:** only few here are concerned, but it's a pet peeve of mine. I collect firearms and am a competitive shooter. I buy around 3 guns a year. Most times I have to get a criminal record and everytime I have to get a new weapon purchase permit. Wouldn't a lifetime licence be easier for everybody?
