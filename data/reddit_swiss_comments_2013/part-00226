true,korky1318,vs,Valais,"I've never lived outside of Valais. I discussed that same question with a friend from Vaud not long ago. 

I love the coziness of all the nature (if that makes any sense at all) and being surrounded by a chain of mountains which gives a kind of protective feeling. 

I love viande séchée and Petite Arvine. And Apéro after work. 

I love living 2 minutes from the ski slopes. 

I love the warmth and sun we get in the summer. It's often cloudy in big cities like Geneva and Zürich, here we have a big blue sky and tons of stars at night. The winter is freezing but okay. I kinda like when it snows massive amounts and everything is turning batshit on roads. 

I hate the fact that everything is so scattered. I have to take my car for everything. Most of my friends live across the canton. To buy materials and shit for hobbies and such I have to travel a good 40min to Hornbach. 

The nightclubs are shitty. Some bars are cool, some events are excellent fun (Carnaval, wine tasting, .. ) but there's nowhere that student atmosphere that you find in Lausanne or Geneva. 

The mindset of some people isn't the most open you'll find. 

There are a lot of drunktards. And not only young people trust me. I remember hearing about Valais being the canton with most car accidents due to alcohol. Doesn't surprise me really. 

If you live in a village, you know everyone and everyone knows you. You're also being watched 24/7. Old retired ladies with nothing to do but stare behind curtains all day just to find something to rant about to their friends the next day.. 

I hate fucking ""rednecks"" you find up in those valleys for many reasons I'd rather not mention. 

In conclusion, I don't see myself spending all my life here because it lacks some fun. I feel like I'm going to be stuck in a dead-end routine. But as a retirement home 40 years from now, I probably wouldn't be happier anywhere else.

If I go out of my house for 5 seconds and look around, I can already see at least 3 people looking at me from the darkness of their room haha. But the peace is amazing.
