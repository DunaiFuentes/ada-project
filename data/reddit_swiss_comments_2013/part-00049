Your list of activities looks pretty solid already. Trummelbach falls is also pretty cool.  I did a lot of skydiving there and I enjoyed the setting a lot.  I'm presuming that BASE jumping is not an option for you so I won't go there. Don''t presume upon good weather, so for every activity that you have planned that requires clear skies, have a backup plan if you don't want to just stay inside relaxing.

Sorry, but I'm not ok at all with the police going to negotiate during hours/days, something that will cost us gigantic amounts of tax money. Hell, they should have tasered him to begin with (or for the mater have guys with tasers for exactly those situations). Stuff like this only happens in Switzerland. You don't even need any hostages or actual firearms. Just act like an ass with your samurai sword and 50 cops will camp outside your house for a few days.

Also, it's a shame that somebody like this can walk around freely during his trial. ",0,1363316121,null,0,1363316402,0,c8vwdpg,t3_1aarun,t1_c8vwdpg,t3_1aarun,null,1431590016,-1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,-1
true,DeepBlueNemesis,bs,Beide Basel,"I have to disagree with you on almost every point. Whenever I read something on /r/worldnews that has a cop story in it I always think ""Man I sure am glad that our cops exercise restraint"". Why would you call a SWAT-Team, break into his house with full force and risk injury of cops and that guy? Just negotiate, time is on your side and it doesn't cost too much extra money (unlike a SWAT-raid) because those cops would be on duty anyway, they're just not doing patrols / writing tickets. The few extra-shifts don't cost that much by comparison. 

Stuff like this ""only happens in Switzerland"" exactly *because* it's so peaceful here. I'm happy (and perhaps a bit cynical) that you don't have to murder some people and torture some more in your basement before the police siege your house. 

I agree on the Taser-statement. Then again we base our information solely on that article, so we don't know what happened; when he was out of range of pepperspray he was most likely out of range of a taser too, and that does not factor in possible obstacles such as a fence (or the debate on tasers in general).

Why wouldn't he be allowed to walk around freely? Innocent until proven guilty. There are people who are in jail during their trial, yes, but those were caught in the act or otherwise dangerous (burglary, murder, threat of leaving the country etc)",0,1363335839,null,0,false,0,c8w0zt6,t3_1aarun,t1_c8w0zt6,t1_c8vwdpg,null,1431592177,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5
