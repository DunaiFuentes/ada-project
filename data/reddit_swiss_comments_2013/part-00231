true,buyacasha,zh,Zürich,"&gt; The main problem is, I think, the thinking that this is somehow a temporary state,

I absolutely disagree with this statement. Switzerland is a hard place to make friends, period. That statement is true both if you yourself are a foreigner or not. In my opinion, there are a number of components, each contributing to the problem:

* **Geography:** We are a nordic country with cold weather. Culturally, that in itself makes it harder to socialize than, say, in Brazil.
* **Language:** Only applies to certain parts of CH: Swiss people communicate in Schwiizerduetsch. Whenever a foreigner is part of the group, the whole group either needs to converse in English or high german so as to not exclude the immigrant from the get go. It is damn well near impossible to properly integrate into an existing group of people if that whole group needs to switch language whenever you're there.
* **Geography 2:** Switzerland is a tiny tiny country. When a Swiss person goes to university, he or she usually ends up living somewhere like 30 minutes from where they grew up and actually doesn't even switch their group of friends at all. See how a lot of Swiss people at university have their university colleagues; and then there's the real friends back home which they see each weekend. It is extremely **hard** for someone to move from that one group of colleagues to the way more exclusive group of friends. And that doesn't even include the additional language barrier for immigrants which makes it doubly hard.
* **Individualism:** As much as certain groups like to deny it; Switzerland and it's people are a boring boring bunch of conformists. Any form of individualism that goes beyond a different color of your shirt is frowned upon. Just have a look at a real city in any other country and you'll know what I'm talking about. As a foreigner, you're different. That alone is a hindering factor (This is **not** a point about racism, but a point for conformism).

&gt; Maybe not in the folkloristic and frankly reactionary utopia the right wants to sell us, but in lived reality.

Wut?! Yes, let's just blame the right...

I'd say we're a Central European country and there is still a substantial difference in comparison with our peers in Belgium, France, Germany, and the UK. Only the Netherlands now fare worse (Sweden would be interesting to know).

I don't disagree with your analysis. It accounts for a lot of the experience foreigners have in Switzerland. What I argue for is that we try to overcome  some of the obstacles that are even for many Swiss themselves a nuissance, such as f.e. said conformism. Second, it would already help a lot, if we patched up our rocky relationship with 'Hochdeutsch' and you don't even need to ask foreigners, you can ask any Romand any he will tell you it's diffcult to come by with his 'Hochdeutsch' in the 'Düütschschwiiz' because everyone simply speaks 'Mundart'. That's simply a lack of respect even if it's out of ignorance.

And don't simply brush away that the right has its part of the blame in this. Ask any German living in Switzerland whether they have experienced maltreatement because of their heritage. There are people out there and it may be just a marginal number, who feel legitimized by the public discours about Ausländer and Massenimmigration to make these people feel unwelcome here. They poison the pond for all of us.
