In 1997, there were for the first time more foreigners than Swiss among the convicts under criminal law (out of a fraction of 20.6% of the total population at the time).

true,Motzlord,tg,Thurgau,"I really have to say; I'm very sorry about how you've been treated and it's certainly absolutely not OK. I do think however, that since you're asian (?), people either assume that you're a tourist (who wouldn't know any German) or some ""weird Mongolian barbarian immigrant"". And I mean that not in a negative way, but when they assume that you're a foreigner (or immigrant), they immediately think you don't know anything about our very peculiar Swiss way of life. 

Telling you to go back home is very extreme though and I really hope that doesn't happen on a daily basis. I just think it's those people's way of dealing with it - and while certainly despicable - they wouldn't know how to otherwise deal with it, because in their narrowmindedness they're having a hard time with immigrants.

And here is why it's not racism: It's not because you're black, asian, eastern european or whatever, it's just because you're 'a foreigner' and they for some reason assume you're a threat. Not because they think you're ugly, lazy, or whatever - no, just because they don't understand the concept of migration and have never left Switzerland for longer than a two week holiday. Their simple mind cannot comprehend that you might actually belong here.

Please don't take the following as rightist propaganda, but even though a huge amount of immigrants here does not become criminal, amongst the people who get convicted for crimes, there is a major foreigner percentage. ([Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Switzerland#Immigrant_criminality)) This is a problem, but exactly those people who are telling you to go ""where you cam from"" are making it worse by making it worse than it is. Sure, the crime rare of Angolan Immigrants is 6.3 times higehr than that of the Swiss, but how many are there? Certainly not several millions. ;)

Sorry, I got a little carried away. Am I right to assume that those incidents where you've been told to go home have been seldom? Have a nice day. :)",0,1376476515,null,0,false,0,cbngqy5,t3_1k9hpm,t1_cbngqy5,t1_cbngczo,null,1429834496,0,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,0

true,Motzlord,tg,Thurgau,"I'm sorry, but it's still not racism, there is a very clear definition of what racism is. I'm not saying that talking to an asian person as if she was a kid is OK, but I don't instantly assume a racist pretext. I'd assume that they thought you wouldn't speak German well and tried to adjust. Of course that's judgemental, but the person was just trying to be nice. So no, not racist. Also, I'm not trying to convince anybody of anything, I just refuse to label misunderstandings as racist .(e.g. Oprah's hand bag)


I do very well comprehend the division that you speak of, but I was not aware that it was still such an issue. At universities, seriously?! You'd think that by now people got used to having fellow citizens from all around the world who have grown up here. I just can't understand those people, because I don't work that way. I mean if I randomly met you on the street, I wouldn't have thought to speak anything else but Swiss German to you unless you would be in the middle of a group of asians pointing their cameras at sights.

There is an us/them division, but it's not because of race, it's between ""Swiss"" people and ""foreigners"". It's very bad that it is this way and it sucks that if you look Swiss enough, no one bats an eye, but it's still not based on racist ideologies, say that all Asians are work whores and are only good in factories and that all black people are stupid and should be governed by the white man. Generally, Swiss people are rather open-minded (especially in the cities), but they don't know how to deal with the situation so instead they rather stumble into things and people get offended.
