I tend to trust that given how slow and huge the system is (there's a lot of people implicated in everything), there's enough ways for a shitty law to be stopped during the process.

I just wanted to add another thing, in Switzerland we get called to vote quite often a few times a year, each time for several things. In quite a few cases I read the documentation enclosed several times, I ask for friend's opinions and all, but in the end I can't seem to make a choice. It can be because I don't understand the issues, its implications and/or both choices seem equal (equally bad or equally good).

Aside of conscription still being a thing there is also a law mandating you build a nuclear fallout shelter in your house or buy yourself a space in a shared nuclear fallout shelter. Those shelters have to be able to withstand a 12 megatons nuclear detonation occurring 700m away. This law was recently slightly softened (You no longer have to build your own shelter if you build a house, but you'll have to buy yourself a place in a shared shelter).
