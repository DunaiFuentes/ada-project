I'm very uninformed about Swiss issues, compared to international ones and when talking to other Swiss people about their experiences during their childhood I cannot identify it with mine at all. I like Switzerland though and I think we do a lot of things right, but I'm not really Swiss in the ""Eidgenosse"" sense.

The effort to separate the ""real"" Swiss from the naturalized ones also reminds of the term ""Papierli Schwiizer"", meaning somebody who is only Swiss on paper, but not at heart.

true,Pretty_Little_Shit,null,null,"It's in social psychology, and essentially the researchers noticed that sales in American products went up after 9/11, but foreign-made sales decreased. The hypothesis they formed was that a fear of death makes people want to buy products from their home country. They tested this in 2 different experiments. So far the first experiment is about having people take a personality test, and then having them write a short essay either over dental pain (control group) or death (experimental group). They would then be given both Dr. Pepper and Rivella to drink however much they wanted to, and both groups would then rate what they thought of the sodas. Those who were imagined what it would be like to die reported Dr. Pepper as worse and drank less of it compared to the control group. They also ended up drinking more Rivella than the control group.

Since it was set in Switzerland, constant better Rivella reviews in the group would generally suggest that the hypothesis that sales of stuff made from your own country was bought more. However, it seems that Rivella doesn't taste anything like Dr. Pepper. What's more, they used name-brand products, making product loyalty a confounding variable. They should have just claimed that there are 2 new off-brand sodas of similar taste, and then ask them to taste if the ""foreign-made"" one or the ""homeland-made"" one was better. The kicker being that they're both the same soda. This would remove brand-loyalty and the fact that there might be a taste difference.

The second experiment involves chocolate. I haven't read that far into it yet, as it seems to add more variables involving justification, but so far it still seems to suggest that they offered people 2 different types of chocolate to see which they would like more.
