true,okko7,null,null,"Hm. One can argue that SOME news that is not completely independent is better than NO local news. 

By the way: All radio and TV stations in Switzerland receive money from the government (through their concession; BAKOM/OFCOM is managing that). To limit governmental control, these rules focus A LOT on the editorial independence. 

Another thing to add: If there is no governmental subsidies, the media will have to get more and more money from advertisers, where I'm not sure about the independence (from advertisers) either. Then we'd end up with only media like 20 minutes.",0,1374695374,null,0,false,0,cb9h5yx,t3_1iyfp8,t1_cb9h5yx,t1_cb9gy0z,null,1430350095,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
