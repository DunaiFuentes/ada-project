Definitely check out the Emmental region it's not that far from Basel or Bern. In the Emmental go to trubschachen to the kambly Swiss chocolate store, ahhhh it was awesome! Don't eat lunch trust me, you will fill up on free samples fast! 

Side note** Trub, the town just up the road, is where my mothers side of the family originates, last name ""Troyer""

Switzerland is all beautiful? but interlaken and that region is something else entirely, BEAUTIFUL, 
we took a car up to Beadenburg on the north side of Interlaken, for a totally awesome view of the valley and alps, we watched as para gliders launched just above us and floated down into the valley...

There is a whole lot more to do and we were only focused on maybe half of Switzerland.

A couple tips, If you drive instead if train, be sure to have a good GPS with and A hard copy Map with details, the roads and the map and physically are no very well marked, and if you ask a local they are defiantly nice, but vague I'm directions. 

It seems that every small town has an inn and restaurant, it's worth the time for a unique experience of eating there, also try the Rosti, ahh  I'm salivating thinking about it.. 

Holy cow this is getting long

If you eat out or even buying any water, restaurant or coop be sure you clarify if you want sparkling carbonated water, they drink it a lot.  

Yes it's expensive for us, but it's worth it and I would go agin in a heartbeat! Have fun!

true,123sb,be,Bern,"I have a similar problem when I go to Switzerland. I was born there but moved to Canada at a young age however, I can still speak Swiss German very well with an almost perfect Bern accent. The only problem I have is that my vocabulary is far from excellent and I often struggle to find the right word for what I'm trying to communicate. When I talk to Swiss strangers one of three things often happens:

1) upon learning that I'm from Canada they immediately switch to English, this doesn't bother me too much because a lot of the family I usually stay with are older and don't speak much English so it can be refreshing to speak in my preferred language. 

2) They hear that I'm not from Switzerland and immediately start speaking hochdeutsch to me. I HATE this. I am ten times better at Berndeutsch than hochdeutsch and I never learned hochdeutsch in school. I understand that it's a natural instinct for Swiss people to switch to the standardized language whenever they speak with an Ausländer but sometimes no matter how many times you remind them that you prefer dialect they still keep speaking hochdeutsch to you. Luckily I can understand Swiss people speaking Hochdeutsch much better than actual Germans because they usually speak quite slowly (well, if they're from Bern) and don't even bother trying to hide their Swiss accent which makes it seem a lot more familiar to me.

3) The absolute worst thing that can happen, and it unfortunately happens to me a lot, is when I start out speaking perfect Berndeutsch, sounding perfectly normal and fitting in perfectly with the locals until I get to a point where I completely forget what word I'm supposed to use. When I stumble over my words or if I have a hard time getting my point across because I can't think of the correct phrase I immediately start to worry that people think I'm mentally retarded. I don't know if people actually think I'm some weirdo who can't communicate like a normal person or if I'm just imagining this. Sometimes I just give up and explain my situation, that I was born in Switzerland but English is my number one language. However, I try to avoid this at all costs because it makes me feel like I'm admitting defeat. Besides, if I do this people will either start talking to me in hochdeutsch or English or might get even more confused and ask, ""oh, but then how come you can speak such good Berndeutsch?""

To me it's something that just happens. Politeness might be part of it, but i think in my case it's more about not standing out too much as it even goes beyond of the Swiss German/Standard German switch discussed in here. I regularly catch myself slightly adjusting my Swiss German depending on what part of the country i am in or who i'm talking to.

Slightly adjusting meaning stuff like switching between ""drüü"" and ""drei"" (""three"") or ""füfi"", ""füüf"" and ""foifi"" (""five"").",0,1372372791,null,0,false,0,carldsr,t3_1h6jyz,t1_carldsr,t3_1h6jyz,null,1430659814,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
