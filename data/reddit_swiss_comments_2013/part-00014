Did you ever tried to do business in Europe? Taxes and how many burocracy you have to deal with are very objective metrics. In Switzerland you simply start working. No registration is required, no VAT number, no impressum on your website, nothing. Once a year you fill a tax form and that's all (there is just a little thing with social security, to do once). In Europe you need all those things, plus in some cases you have to fill 4 hyper complex tax forms a year. (And in some places you will be automatically labelled as tax evader, just because you're not an employee)

Taxes are obviously lower in Switzerland, but we are talking about full taxes. When your business is small your taxes are 0.- in Switzrland. How much VAT do you pay? 0.- until your income is less than 75'000.- (and if you earn more  you pay the low Swiss VAT with a lot of simplified options)

One can argue that you pay less taxes but you also have less social ""features"", like no universal healthcare. False! Until your net income is lower then 60'000.- the state pay part of your medical insurance, this part is up to 100% for lower incomes. The state also builds and maintains all kind of beautiful infrastructure which is objectively better then in many other countries.
