Around 80-90% of the accused are foreigners. 20% of those cases end with a conviction. Odds are pretty high that this guy was just drunk and wanted to chat, but there's no reason to take any risks.

I'm pretty sure, yes. That's pretty much standard. If for whatever reason this doesn't work, call again or go with 112 (the international number, works too). But always go with 117 first, I'm sure they'll figure it out.

&gt;Also, if I had called them that night would they have driven me home or something?

Yes, probably. I had quite a few interactions with the police (10-20) due to a summer job and they're overly nice here.

A year ago, my car broke down and they were doing speed controls 500m upfront. I walked up to them and asked if they could give me a lift (5min drive) because I would be late to work otherwise and didn't have enough for a taxi on me. They did, because they ''were leaving anyway''.

Other story: two years ago I had a little car accident (car + ice + low speed = car stuck on small roundabout in a very low traffic area). I called them and the towing service. They were here in 5min, but the towing service was 30-40min away. It was 06am in the morning and my workplace (summer job) was just next to the roundabout. I told them that I had to go to work (they previously asked what I was doing there) and they offered to wait for the towing service for me. I checked 30min later and they were still there. Pretty amazing if you ask me.
