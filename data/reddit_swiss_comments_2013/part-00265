true,ughthat,ar,Appenzell Ausserrhoden,"I think it's a good start, and Switzerland needs a site like this that doesn't feel like it is stuck in 1995. To me there are several issues with the UX and information architecture to make this truly usable tho. So these comments are intended as constructive criticism =)

* If I visit your site I am looking for something. This means that from an information architecture standpoint search is the most important feature on your landing page, but its completely buried. Even the main cities you have listed above the map are de-prioritized. It took me over a minute to read through the site and figure out how to search for a specific location. If this was a random site that I just came across while looking for an apartment I would have bounced after the first 10 seconds. Search should be front and center on your landing page.

* The stats you list (number of apartments in the search and the average price per sqft) are really interesting, but they should not be the main priority from an information architecture standpoint since they don't really help me make a decision in any way. Chances are that I am looking at a specific town or region because I already have a pretty good idea that that is where I want to move (because of a job, family or whatever else). On the listings page I would recommend prioritizing the actual listings and having regional statistics lower on the page. You might also think about adding an ""explore"" page to the site that shows a table of cantons/towns with a sortable table that lists the average prices, number of listings,etc.

* As is the map is fairly useless (I know what Bern looks like =) But it would be awesome if you had pins for all of the actual listings on the map and let me browse them that way. This would allow me to get a sense of the locations of apartments/houses relative to things like the train station, schools, etc. It would also give me a better sense of how cheap/expensive places are relative to their proximity to the center of the town/city.

You may already know this site, but I would take a look at http://www.zillow.com/ for inspiration. They are US only, but may give you some ideas/inspiration. Like I said, I think meter-square.com is a good start, and with a bit of iteration it could become fantastic =)",0,1386539222,null,0,false,0,cdwvd0k,t3_1se1fd,t1_cdwvd0k,t1_cdwnlq2,null,1428336803,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
