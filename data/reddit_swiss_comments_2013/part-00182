Because IPTV works differently, you need another box (5 CHF/month I believe) per TV you want to attach. Unless your telephone line is really old and therefore does not support the necessary bandwidth, Swisscom TV would support up to three TVs.

Swisscom has its flaws but from what I can tell they are minor compared to UPC's. From time to time the box requires a good cold restart, otherwise it will either not show a picture anymore. A bit of ""turn off, turn on"" is involved especially after software updates, but other than that it's working quite well.
