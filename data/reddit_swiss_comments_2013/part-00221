Regarding VAT (MWST) and fees:
You need to pay VAT for everything you order from a foreign country. But if the VAT ist less than CHF 5, they (Post, customs) will not charge it. In the moment, VAT is 8% (2.5% on books and food/drinks). 
So the calculation is as follows:
(Value of the purchase in CHF + postage and handling in CHF)*8%=VAT

Switzerland's biggest and most beautiful glacier is Aletsch Glacier. Here is [a tour I found](http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/exploring-the-aletsch-glacier-by-mountain-bike.html) for you. And [this one](http://www.mountainbikeland.ch/en/routes/route-0673.html) is not really next to glaciers but it is a very beautiful scenery and you will see some glaciers and lots of mountains from a distance.

For kayaking: Visit [this site](http://www.kanuland.ch/en/canoeing-in-switzerland.html). There you'll find some routes and general tips. As far as I know the rhine canyon is very beautiful and popular, but also not very challenging. [More infos](http://www.ruinaulta.ch/en/offer-RuinaultaGR-KanuRaftingRuin-88725.html).
