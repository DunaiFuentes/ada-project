true,sethzenz,cern,CMS,"In general, the way we would detect a dark matter candidate particle at the LHC is by the ""missing energy.""  That is, we look for collisions with high-energy Standard Model particles going toward one side of the detector, and with nothing on the other side.  Conservation of Energy tells us there has to be something there, and that something doesn't interact with our detector.  Non-interaction is exactly what makes it possible dark matter, so if we can't explain the amount of missing energy with any Standard Model process or detector uncertainty, then we'd start to think we were on the right track.

What all that means is that our searches aren't particular to any specific model of dark matter like the ones you listed.  We're always looking for the key feature - that the particles don't interact.

true,sethzenz,cern,CMS,"Marco, our theorist from the last episode, provided these points to add here:

The model of anapole DM is a recent interesting idea. Basically, it postulates that DM interacts very very weakly (even more weakly that commonly assumed) with ordinary matter, by exchanging a very ""suppressed"" photon. In this respect, it shares common features with other models, which are also a bit outside of the mainstream WIMP paradigm. The nice aspect is that it is expected to be tested rather soon by the Xenon experiment. So we will soon know!

One can search for DM in other ways too: by looking at excesses in cosmic rays which could be produced by self-distructions of Dark Matter particles in space (as AMS does, as we discussed in the hangout) or by witnessing a collision of one DM particle with a nucleus in a super-screened experiment located deep underground (an extremely rare occurrence!). This second technique seems most promising for the anapole DM model, and the Xenon experiment is luckily going to present its latest findings soon.
