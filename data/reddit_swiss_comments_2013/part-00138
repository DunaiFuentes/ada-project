However, I'm not very confident about the council-debate because it seems that they do not have much (technical) knowledge about the subject and may decide stuff which is either simply not realistic or wouldn't make any sense.

In this regard, see this section from the [link](http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/ejpd/de/home/dokumentation/mi/2013/2013-02-271.html) you've posted. Emphasis is from me.
