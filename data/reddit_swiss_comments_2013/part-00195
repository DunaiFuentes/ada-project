That makes sense about the session exams. I just had no idea why they were so late. In America all final exams are held in the two weeks following the end of lectures. 

One of my hopes for studying abroad was to be able to travel to other parts of Europe while I'm there, but the session exams end just as my semesters at home start. Would those months in between lectures and exams be an okay time to travel or do I really need all that time to study? 

About the yearly courses, there is someone below who said that the yearly courses are just offered yearly, and only take a semester to complete. You said the opposite, where did you get that info? I'm not saying you're wrong it's just that he claimed he was a student there and the answers were inconsistent. Unless I totally misunderstood what he said.

true,korky1318,vs,Valais,"I worked in that area for a year or two before changing and it is vital to have good connections. You usually start off with one client or one company blabla and then he/they recommend you further and so on. If you have skills in one particular domain, let's say Joomla or one of its extensions, a company might hire you for a short-term job. But then again, that often goes from ear to ear since they already have connections and is rarely posted on online job websites or the likes. 

Where I worked briefly they gave their designs jobs to guys in Thailand because it was much cheaper that way! 

The competition is pretty strong aswell. There's loads of little businesses (1-4 guys max) around now that do this kinda thing. Or try to. So again connections and something that sets you apart. 

If you have a particular skill you might try to get in contact with some companies to see if they need you. I heard the guys who made nespresso.ch started out small and are now a pretty big deal.

As for the wage. It's pretty damn good. You can get paid over 100chf/hour. Where I worked they charged from 2000-3000chf on for even the simplest of websites (talking menu buttons, couple of pages, slick design and no animations). From there on it can get to 15,000 - 20,000 chf and even above.

Sorry, I hate to admit that, but sometimes, they are really imperialistic in their views: Their way or none at all, no discussion allowed*.

Hey, guess what, *you* came here, nobody forced you, as *you* left the most free country in the world - according to your tales (except young leftist/liberal minded backpackers, as one can imagine). Why are you complaining that there is too much freedom in Switzerland? wtfseriously

They are probably more harmful to the development of our state than other certain groups that are on display all the time by a certain party in Berne. :)
