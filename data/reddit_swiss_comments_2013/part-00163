So it was a little bit hard for her to find something fitting in that time span.


But she got a new job and will inquire more about her schedule and maybe she can include something else in her day. She enjoys music, movies and eating healthy so if you know of any group that includes those things, I would really appreciate it if you could tell me about it.

I'll try to answer your questions in order, but I should mention that my field of study (computer graphics) is quite far away from yours, so please keep that in mind.

* The whole software development industry is huge. You will definitely find major outlets for all the top 10 development houses. Accenture, IBM, Google, etc. all have their EMEA centers here, and the close ties to academia coupled with excellent education system are a big plus for software engineering companies.

* Assuming you mean academic research purely on the university level (and not in industry - I can't tell you much about that), at least ETH (my uni) is extremely research-focussed, to such a degree that graduates rarely go to actual researchless Software Engineering positions, and more R&amp;D positions.

* I would say that 60% of my undergrad and 95% of my graduate level lectures, projects etc. were held in English. This is largely coupled with the fact that English is just the lingua franca in the institutes - the percentage of German-speaking professors and postdocs is tiny.

* I don't think I can contribute much to the question of competition. There isn't really any resource you would need to compete for - courses are small enough that there is plenty of attention, study and research opportunity for interested parties. Couple that with the fact that there is in fact a surplus of jobs to be filled after graduation, I never felt any level of competition.

* None. No seriously. You do have to jump through hoops to get a visa etc., but that is unavoidable.

While the Bachelor curriculum is more or less ""fixed"", during the Master one can quite freely choose what courses to take. There are main ""paths"", i.e. Security, Info. Systems, Computational Science, Distributed Systems.. but you are only forced take certain curses of your specific path. For instance, I am doing Information Systems but half my courses where from Security (apart from crypto I loved security courses.. hah).

I believe you should consider taking your Master at ETHZ. From there, it is very easy to get to know the research group that better fits your interests... and if you have good grades, it is most likely they'll easily accept you for Doctorate.. 

The software industry in Switzerland is still growing (lots of startups and job opportunities). Academic research is strong, definitely. Big money is in Computational Science. 

Not sure what you mean by competitive, but from what I saw during the Master.. students have to compete against each other in some sense. The points required to pass an exam depend on the average score.. you are most likely to pass an exam if others suck. This said, there various students associations that collect summaries, old exams and so on. That helps. No idea how things work at Doctorate level, but it seems chill enough.
