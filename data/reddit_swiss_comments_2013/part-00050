true,JabJabSplash,null,null,"&gt;I have to disagree with you on almost every point. Whenever I read something on /r/worldnews that has a cop story in it I always think ""Man I sure am glad that our cops exercise restraint"". 

I too like our generally peaceful police, but that's not a reason to let a guy with a sword dictate the action. What would have happened if this guy had a gun inside and killed a couple cops through his window? Or the other person inside? Or himself?

&gt;Why would you call a SWAT-Team, break into his house with full force and risk injury of cops and that guy?

Well, it ended like this. The main difference is that they had an opportunity to stop him, outside, without risking any injuries. By letting him get back inside, you risk a multitude of different things: he takes the other person hostage, he can arm himself with actual guns, he can kill himself, etc. Possibilites are endless.

&gt;Just negotiate, time is on your side and it doesn't cost too much extra money (unlike a SWAT-raid) because those cops would be on duty anyway, they're just not doing patrols / writing tickets. The few extra-shifts don't cost that much by comparison.

I think you're wrong here. Those aren't just cops that ''would have been giving tickets otherwise'' and that's without taking into account that the special intervention unit had to deploy anyways. We're talking about ten thousands franks without a doubt.

&gt;I agree on the Taser-statement. Then again we base our information solely on that article, so we don't know what happened; when he was out of range of pepperspray he was most likely out of range of a taser too, and that does not factor in possible obstacles such as a fence (or the debate on tasers in general).

There are pics were you can see them being only a few meters appart, him being blocked in a open field in front of a closed door. Pepperspray, in small containers like cops usually cary, are very ineffective on mid/long range. It's useful in a fistfight, but ineffective if the counterpart is armed with anything biffer than a pocketknife. Tasers, on the other side, have a range between 3-10m usually. They would have been the *perfect* tool in that situation. 

&gt;Why wouldn't he be allowed to walk around freely? Innocent until proven guilty. There are people who are in jail during their trial, yes, but those were caught in the act or otherwise dangerous (burglary, murder, threat of leaving the country etc)

We're talking about a guy that supposedly infected *16!* people on purpose, against their will, with AIDS. We're talking about somebody that supposedly is batshit crazy, not just a random idiot. Like we just could witness, he did represent a threat to others.

This said, I don't blame our cops - at all. They do a great job and I'm sure they acted like they were told to do. ",0,1363359303,null,0,1363359525,0,c8w4s8y,t3_1aarun,t1_c8w4s8y,t1_c8w0zt6,null,1431594052,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

The point is that he didn't have a gun, he had a sword. But again, I'm not certain that it would have gone down differently - cops cannot shoot first! He would have waived his gun, everyone would have shouted a lot but they couldn't have actually prevented him from running back inside.

Yup, you were right (and look what happened - people got hospitalized. Guess we were both right). As a firefighter I can tell you that all those ""what if""-thoughts are pointless right now. You have a code of conduct for such situations, and the officers most likely stuck to it, and now the people in charge will analyze the situation and see if the CoC could be improved.  And I really advise you that you shouldn't take media reports (not even pictures. *Especially* not pictures) as reliable and 100% accurate sources, I've heard (and witnessed) enough stories to know that most reporters just use second-hand info and even edit that little. 
&gt; I think you're wrong here. Those aren't just cops that ''would have been giving tickets otherwise'' and that's without taking into account that the special intervention unit had to deploy anyways. We're talking about ten thousands franks without a doubt.

The keyword here is ""supposedly"". Again, you can't jail someone based on accusations alone. Imagine if you go to the police and say ""X infected me with aids"" and they're just like ""okay, one second we're throwing him into prison right away"". No, first you have to make sure that those accusations are actually true - which is what they're doing during the trial. 

By the way I'm sorry that people are downvoting you. Disagreeing or not (which must never be a reason to downvote someone), I think you're raising some valid points that are worth discussing (that's why I replied in the first place).

Actually, someone (or he himself) said that he had a gun inside (according to media report, so whatever). Either way, I'm not saying that they should have shot him outside wild west style, but they should have intervened and not just stand there and let him go back inside. Do your best to overtake him and obviously, make use of your gun only if he attacks you. Look at what happened: he was able to go back inside to another person, which could have become a victim. Cops do have to enforce the orders they give and can't tolerate that a crazy guy walks around with a sword.

&gt;As a firefighter I can tell you that all those ""what if""-thoughts are pointless right now. You have a code of conduct for such situations, and the officers most likely stuck to it, and now the people in charge will analyze the situation and see if the CoC could be improved.

Like I said, I'm sure they did what they were told to do. Bottom line remains: you have a crazy armed guy and you let him go away, more precisely back in his home where he has a potential victim waiting for him and probably also a gun (we're in Switzerland, it's highly likely). This could have turned out *so much* worse. 

&gt;And I really advise you that you shouldn't take media reports (not even pictures. Especially not pictures) as reliable and 100% accurate sources, I've heard (and witnessed) enough stories to know that most reporters just use second-hand info and even edit that little.

No doubt about that, but I think the major points are well enough documented: he had a sword, he stood in front of a locked door, police was a few meters away from him, there was a woman in his appartement

&gt;Maybe. You can be sure that he has to pay for a lot of it though.

Yeah, in theory, but we all know in practice that this guy won't have to pay for the whole thing. This literally never happens. Best case scenario is that they force him to pay a good amount of it and usually, this ends up with the guy serving it via jour-amendes. On top of this, we all know that he won't serve 100% of them if he behaves somewhat ''normally'' and society will also have to pay for his stay in prison too. 

&gt;The keyword here is ""supposedly"". Again, you can't jail someone based on accusations alone. 

Wrong, you can. It's called ''Untersuchungshaft''. The requirements are pretty strict though. Also, we're way past the point where they only had random accusations against him.",0,1363364420,null,0,1363364629,0,c8w6gty,t3_1aarun,t1_c8w6gty,t1_c8w62ga,null,1431594843,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
