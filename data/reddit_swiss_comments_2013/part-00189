You can also try to convince or just ask members of parliament to put forward a [parliamentary motion or initiative.](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlamentarische_Initiative) It usually helps if you organise yourself with other like-minded people and/or organizations/parties first, obviously. There are several members of parliament that really make an effort to get in contact with the people in order to adress (usually, but not necessarily, minor) issues that otherwise would not be on anyones agenda. You can see who put what motion forward, how it was handled, discusses, voted upon etc. all on the website of the parliament. 

There is a great deal of accountability, just look at all the information they provide on their website. And as the constituencies are quite small (compared to germany or the US, for example), members of parliament feel the backlash quite fast if they fuck up.

Incidentally, there was some debate in the last years (and still going on) about transparency, as the votings of members of the Ständerat (senate) were not public. That is, the end result was known, obviously, but not the particular vote of any one candidate. After some motions by members of the SVP (right wing party) and voting scandals in the Ständerat [this issue has been partially adressed now.](http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/schweiz/elektronische-abstimmung-im-staenderat-vor-durchbruch-1.18042296)

Another interesting fact is that members of parliament have to declare their [Interessenbindungen](http://www.parlament.ch/d/wissen/parlamentswoerterbuch/seiten/interessenbindung.aspx) after they get elected. So they have to state their profession, what company boards they are on, other political or governmental activities and other such things and keep them up to date. This information is publicly available

So all in all, the Swiss have good contact to their representatives when they want and the politicians are mostly held acountable for their actions. That being said, there will always be those that feel they are not represented at all, that the classe politique (political elite) are just doing what they want/manipulated by big business etc and basically just fuck the system.

The problem I have with the ""WIFI near"" in particular is, that I'm not necessary near the position I want to set the profile for. You can scan for MAC addresses, but that doesn't help much if you're far far away from there.

So I thought it would be neat if I could just say: show me the MAC addresses active near Position X/Y (lat/long) so I can use it in tasker.

Or, even better, let me generate a tasker profile on a website that I then can import into tasker.

true,xeribulos,sg,St. Gallen,"Interesting question, had to look up the specifics myself.

The market for electricity is in the process of being liberalized and there are many smallish electricity suppliers with differing ownership structures (partly public owned, vertical integration, etc.) This leads to different approaches in different regions. 

That being said, the differences are quite high indeed, up to 70%. Some of our politicians noticed this too and asked the federal council to explain these high differences (among other interesting things happening during this liberalization). [Here](http://www.parlament.ch/d/suche/seiten/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20113580) you will find the questions and the answers (in German).

The 2nd question and the answers are most relevant here. I will not translate the whole thing but to sum it up, there are several key factors leading to the high price discrepancies:

a) general factors:
- business strategy of the electricity suppliers
- efficiency of the suppliers
- public use/infrastructure demand (e.g. street lamps) and how much of these costs are payed via a direct electricity fee (which increases the price) and how much are payed out of the general budget (income tax revenue of the municipality)

for the b) and c) it is important to understand that the typical electricity bill in Switzerland always has 2 main position: a fixed cost and variable costs. The first is the bace price you pay for your network acess, the second you pay per unit (kWh) consumed

b) energy factors (affecting the price per unit consumed)
- procurement costs: if the suppliers owns its own plant, they can sell cheaper. if they have to shop around the (getting slowly liberalized) market it is more expensive

c) network acess factors (affecting the base price)
- topography (hilss&amp;mountains = more expensive)
- settlement pattern (urban = cheaper, rural = scattered = more exensive)
- consumption pattern: the network has to be able to sustain peak consumption. if these peaks are only reached during one season (e.g. in winter in places with high winter tourism) it gets more expensive because you will need a lot of infrastructure which gets amortized very slowly. If the consumption is more stable, it gets cheaper (usually urban areas)

It may also be important to point out that the typical household does not have an option to chose another supplier than the one in their region. The market is only liberalized for major customers (consumption of over 100 MWh/year, typically industrial companies). This is about half of the total consumption.",0,1378887649,null,0,1378888058,0,cc62n9d,t3_1m4mpf,t1_cc62n9d,t1_cc5vpue,null,1429503330,6,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,6
