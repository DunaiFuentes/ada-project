true,SamSample0815,sz,Schwyz,"Hey there, 
I am studying at the HSG and my girlfriend at the ZHAW. I'll try to share some of my thoughts:

* As Doemeltier has pointed out, the biggest difference is the kind of educational institution (Applied Sciences vs. University).

* As many have pointed out, HSG has a good reputation not only in Switzerland but intetnationally, especially for Finance. (s. [Financial Times Ranking](http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/masters-in-management-2012) -&gt;the ranking is only including the SIM-Master, but still gives an idea)

* I think ZHAW has a lot of part time students who mainly work and go to school in the evenings or on one weekday, while the HSG is only for full-time students.

* I can't tell you about the ZHAW but I know there is a fairly big international community at the HSG with a lot of travel-willing and adventure-seeking ppl.

* Citywhise, Zurich has more to offer for sure. But for an American, everything feels like next door anyway. It only takes you a little more than an hour to go to Zurich from St. Gallen. Additionally, as has been pointed out by esec_666 ZHAW buildings are not in the city of Zurich but in Winterthur/Wädenswil.

* The rumors about all HSG-students being arrogant and from wealthy families is wide-spread. However, I can tell you from experience that there are just as many down-to-earth people. It's just the others that get noticed since they match the image in peoples minds (s. [cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance#Belief_disconfirmation_paradigm)).

The vague one can be made to sound harmless enough that a majority of the population will support it yet potent enough to put yourself in a serious negotiation position vis a vis the city.

The specific one is very limited geographically so as to get the support of the rest of the city who doesn't really care if that particular street becomes noisy at night.

Seriously this is all direct democracy 101, it shouldn't be that hard in a city like Bern to get something through. There is enormous support in this town for culture and youth organisations (for all the whining, there is naught city in this country who does more in those fields if you ask me) and it's only a matter of finding the right strategy and phrasing to win.

At least it was last year after the first big TdF, now all that goodwill probably evaporated with the black block's vandalism.

As for nothing getting done yet, this is Switzerland, we are a slow moving people. If you want results you better be ready to commit to more than one year. You need to raise your issue's awareness (and last year's TdF brilliantly achieved that) and then you need to keep hammering at it over a few years, probably a decade.

At the end of it though, never forget, just because you want something and you feel you deserve that something doesn't mean the people will agree with you. There are very good reasons why the Bernese laws are the way they are and there also is a big part of the population who has a stake in protecting their quality of life.
It's not an abstract state ""oppressing the youth"", it's the interests of one subset of the population against the interests of another subset of the population and quite frankly when one listens to the arguments of the pro-night-life proponents one does not feel much sympathy for their complete dismissal of the other side's quality of life.",0,1369772902,null,0,false,0,ca7nzqc,t3_1f2obr,t1_ca7nzqc,t1_ca7mmfr,null,1431004274,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

As mentioned in the other reply, you could also take the Simplon pass. No big difference there.
Then once you're in Switzerland you could drive along the valley, through Montreux and Bern, or take another pass through the mountains but I'm not quite sure of the details. (Furka?)",0,1369777174,null,0,false,0,ca7pl5m,t3_1f78pr,t1_ca7pl5m,t3_1f78pr,null,1431003524,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
