Well, thank you for insulting my country... I see, maybe I have to start arguing with Switzerland living only of fiscal evasion...
Actually, in Sardinia, few km from one of the military bases incriminated, people have very long and healthy lives, they have the highest rate in Europe of people more than 100 years old and the average life duration is significantly higher than in Switzerland. Moreover, not all soldiers with leukemia were exposed to uranium, but all did the same vaccinations. Of course, it's not a proof, but it's a lead to be investigated. The fact that to  prove something like that takes a lot of time, doesn't imply that it can't be true and everybody should now accept those injections without objections.

People should be able to decide for themselves which one they want and which one they don't and when to do them, not governments with economical interests.
