true,b4silio,vd,Vaud,"It depends on what the compensation is for. If you think in terms of ""hours put in"" then indeed, the work is never 200x *longer*. If you think in terms of the concrete activity being performed, a guy/gal on the phone or in meetings the whole day is not working 200x *harder*. However if you think in terms of the value that is brought to the company, one single person can indeed bring 200x *more value* to the company than another. 

Imagine a salesperson that is able to bring in a client for a 2 years contract for 3 million CHF with some company. She/he is bringing a lot of money to the company. Granted, you need the IT guys, and the archive staff, the secretaries and all the others to make the company actually function, but in terms of amount of money that has been brought into the company, the phone calls and business lunches of that one guy/gal may very well be worth more (to the company) than 200x what the lowest paid person brings in. A private company could want to remunerate him/her proportionally to that value, as another salesperson might only be able to get half those contracts.

In the end it boils down to the role that society should have. You should

* Vote for the 1:12 if you believe that society should be able to regulate how a private company decides to structure its compensations: effort-based, value-based, etc.

* Vote against it if you don't think that the role of society is to regulate how a private company decides to evaluate the merits and value of its employees. 

The fact that (as *hubraum* points out) the consequences would potentially be bad for the swiss economy is in a sense secondary to the moral issue.

From a *social inequality* point of view, it may come down to the question of fairness: fairness is not ""everyone should have the same"" but rather, ""no one should have less than they need"" (both these definition are arguable).

I agree with most posts that predict a separation of high and low income departments. This will inflict company culture greatly in some cases, in my opinion. The gap between regular employees and their bosses would become larger and cooperation more difficult.

So I ask myself the question: Is this initiative really improving the situation of the little man (which I'm all for)?
