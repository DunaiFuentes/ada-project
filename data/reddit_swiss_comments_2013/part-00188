true,wb2498,null,null,"Wow, thank you all for the great comments. There are a few points I'd like to specifically make mention of:

1) I think it's common sense that not one post on a forum will completely and accurately describe how every single person in Switzerland feels about every single person in America. There are many subcultures inside both of these very diverse countries. Peoples’ attitudes surely vary depending on location and people themselves are always changing. Regardless, I do think there are definitely trends in any group of people that could be used to understand the social norms and ""unwritten rules"" when engaging in conversation between two different groups. Indeed, some possibly more creative posters did a good job of highlighting some general rules of thumb and I greatly appreciate that.

2) I'm glad to hear that some Swiss residents are willing to admit that there are indeed stereotypes towards Americans like there are in any other part of the world. I'm also glad to hear that the individual characteristics can easily overshadow any broad portrayal in Switzerland (and presumably other countries as well). 

3) I know that in America there is almost a sense of pride with only knowing how to speak one language and to the rest of the world this is seen as ignorant. I'd love to learn a bit of German before I got to Switzerland and I'm happy to have learned that there is a specific Swiss German. Finding a teacher who is aware of these differences will come in handy.

4) It's true that we stress customer service, tips, and commission have something to do with this in certain sectors. Servers get paid a good deal in America just not by their employer. I found this difference interesting since Switzerland supposedly has a small central government. I would presume that this means better service all around since businesses can afford to pay their employees more and residents have more money to tip for good service. I know that there is a cultural difference, however, since many European countries force businesses to pay servers at least minimum wage and so tipping generally isn't as high.

5) Although I work out and eat a balanced diet, I ordered a salad today for lunch having felt some social pressure from the Swiss. I'm not saying that this one small behavior will make me void of any stereotype (they will always exist) but I do think it's a step in a better direction.
