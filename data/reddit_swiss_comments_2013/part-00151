Also you have to remember that you always get what you pay for. Newspapers employ a lot of people and they all need to get paid. If you are not willing to pay a lot of money for your daily news then you don't have to be surprised that newspapers aren't willing to pay journalists that only bring a few articles every month and spend the rest of their time researching. 

This is also why we're seeing a trend towards weekly papers like Sonntagszeitung, because while they are more expensive they also provide a lot more insight and better reaserched articles. They do not come out on a daily basis though, but that means they do not have the added pressure of filling all their pages on a daily basis and cuts printing cost.

Exactly.  But the subsidy model assumes it's legitimate to force independently economically viable business, or the majority of taxpayers / consumers, to pay for something that a minority of people feel they have a right to, and a smaller minority of people feel they have the right to be paid to do.

The Oberhinterstinkenburgertageszeitung is not, no matter how many subsidies you throw at it, going to put together any sort of world-class investigative journalism.  

The argument that mass media is all corrupt trash is invalid - with the Internet, I have access to reddit, BBC, Deutsche Welle, Pravda, CNN, Rodong Sinmum, Al Jazeera, France 1, etc.  That is going to give me a far broader choice of international news than what a local newspaper feels appropriate to filter down to me.  If I am really interested in doing so and willing to put in the time, then I can use the same medium to put together a Oberhinterstinkenburgertageszeitung online for far lower cost than a 1900-era newspaper.  We really shouldn't be allocating mandatory subsidies for nostalgia.

People _have_ access to quality journalism, maybe just not the very local stuff, and not in the specific format that they insist on.  Part of this is also rooted in a highly erroneous kind of nostalgia that ""official"" news sources are somehow better than drawing your own conclusions from the broad selection of news available via the Internet.  People are just not necessarily willing to do the legwork to go out and find it, and it may also mean that you do not have access to the kind of very specific local news that you want in a convenient format.

I remember growing up in CH in the 1970s.  The news was much more serious than anything the Americans have today (although let's be honest and also consider the Walter Cronkites and Edward R. Murrows) but still highly biased and selective.

However, where I grew up (Denmark) the media is heavily subsidised. Besides the two state-owned television networks (which have 5-8 channels between them), all the major newspapers are owned by one of two large companies, which both are heavily subsidised.

On top of that, almost all Danish journalists are educated on the same (state-run) school.

It all adds up to a very politician-focused style of reporting. Politicians get treated like movie stars, and almost all coverage of anything else is shallow and uninformed. Gossip on the front page of all the newspapers.

It's easy to tell that news is produced like a sausage factory. No one cares very much for the ingredients or quality assurance. It's very rare to see in-depth analysis, and what goes on in EU barely gets covered at all.
