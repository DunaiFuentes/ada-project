The problem with Switzerland is that there is nearly nothing abandoned, terrain is too expensive I suppose, and society is more stable as a whole compared to other countries.

According to the [official schedule](http://www.glacierexpress.ch/de/fahrplan_ticket/fahrplan/winter/Pages/default.aspx) it doesn't.
