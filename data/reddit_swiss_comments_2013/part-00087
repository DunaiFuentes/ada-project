 However, it's always interesting to hypothesise what the Federal Council would look like if it were elected by the people. There'd be no hurr-durr-Schneider-Ammann for sure (probably replaced by Keller-Suter), and I think Maillard would have been elected in stead of Berset. I'm also not sure Sommaruga would have been elected, and Burkhalter would have faced some stiff opposition for the second Welsch seat. Leuthard and Widmer-Schlumpf would stay right where they are, but the really interesting part would be what happens to the SVP. Obviously Maurer hasn't got a chance (Gripen anyone?), but I really don't see many SVPers who could replace him at a majoritarian election. Amstutz and Freysinger are the two ones who come to mind.

So this is my prediction for the directly elected Federal Council :
Maillard (SP/PS)
An alemanic socialist woman, perhaps Sommaruga
Leuthard (CVP/PDC)
Keller-Suter (FDP/PLR)
Widmer-Schlumpf (BPD/PBD)
Freysinger (SVP/UDC)
And the seventh seat could fall to absolutely anyone (FDP, SVP, CVP or even the greens), and from anywhere since Freysinger is perfectly capable of getting elected as an alemanic (he probably should since the SVP is a lot less popular in Welschland)",0,1367599325,null,0,false,0,c9rqtqy,t3_1dklsb,t1_c9rqtqy,t3_1dklsb,null,1431336696,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

http://www.interrail.eu/

1 month continuous (&lt;26 years old) for 533 CHF. With this ticket you can go on every train in whole Europe. 

There are additional costs for:

- Sleep trains (with a bed) require a reservation, usually 11CHF. 
- Most trains in Italy require reservation, usually 15-20CHF
- To use the tunnel from Brussel to London, you are required to pay an additional fee of about 100CHF for one way. Easyjet is cheaper.

Tips to save money:

- Don't buy things on the first place you see it. You are thirsty? Don't pay 2€ for a bottle of water. Go to a small shop where it is 30cent refill the last bottle. 
- Avoid restaurants
- Avoid hotels / hostels. Couchsurfing is a good thing. Also, with the ticket you can sleep in the train. Getting tired in Paris? Take a train to Budapest. You can also recharge your phone in almost every train. Avoid the fee for a bed. I personally sleep better on a seat anyway. Having a stranger on top and a stranger under me makes me feel uncomfortable. 
- Take a pillow with you so you can rest your head on the window. Inside the box of a Boxed Wine is a plastic bag that is inflatable. They work great as travel pillows when cleaned.

My advice to you is to really hang about the Vieille Ville (old city) of Geneva.  Walk through the streets.  Drink it in.  So charming and interesting you just might die.  Bring a water bottle with you, the potable water that you get from the fountains anywhere in CH is tastier and cleaner than what you can drink anywhere from the tap in the US.  Be a tourist.  Find out what new clubs are happening prior to your visit and just drop in... dress well though, in Europe first impressions do mean a lot, and the bouncer will chuck you just like any US city if you don't dress to impress.  

At night, if you are in the area of the Gare Cornavin (which is just about the place every visitor lands at), just stroll around, and drop into any random bar you can find.  If anybody puts *anything* in your hand, no matter where it is, politely decline.

The local Swiss might view this as a ""high crime"" area, but to an American at night, you are perfectly safe.  Just avoid bullshit drug dealers, or anybody trying to ""offer"" you something and you're alright.  As in many other European destinations where tourists congregate, armed robbery is almost unheard of, but ""opportunity"" pickpocketing is rife... but don't worry about it.  If you keep your wits about you, you'll be fine.

Keep your wallet in your front pocket, get drunk, stroll around the lakeside... it is magic.  Geneva gets a bad rep for being ""boring"" when it is really quite an interesting and fun city if you're willing to wander off the beaten path, stroll where your feet take you, and try to strike up a conversation with whatever poor French you may have.  There are a load of English speaking expats, so striking up a conversation with a new friend won't be a problem.
