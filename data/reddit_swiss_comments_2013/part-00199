I'll even go as far as saying that being prohibited from working in an army is all-around better than being forced to.

As a Swiss man, I would very much like to import the German model for parental leave. 

But honestly I think the bigger problems in that area are low social acceptance for men who do not work full-time (and this is also something women need to change!) and also the fact that the child care and education systems makes it incredibly hard for both partners to work full time.
