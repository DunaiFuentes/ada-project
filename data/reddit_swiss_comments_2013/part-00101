* Not wanting to do military service is not a good enough reason to get asylum. If you have to expect an unusually cruel punishment for not doing your military service however, then you **will still** get asylum.

* People who are under threat can get a humanitarian visa to enter Switzerland and make their application for asylum in Switzerland.

* The federal government can use its properties for asylum purposes without consulting the cantons. That's ok too in my opinion because it stops those media wars about when and where asylum seekers are accommodated.

* Asylum seekers that interfere with the normal process can be brought to different centers with higher security.

true,canteloupy,vd,Vaud,"Why do you oppose the tightening of asylum law?

The problems of incivility, and petty crime, which are real, will not be solved with the law on asylum. This is the tenth revision we do. Each time we are told that this is to make Switzerland less attractive. Christoph Blocher gave us the same arguments in 2007 and we see that nothing has changed. It is not by tightening rules and violating the principles of human rights for those who are genuine refugees that we progress.

Is Switzerland not too attractive?

People do not come to us according to our laws, but according to the situation in their home: civil wars, threats, or simply because of economic distress. A man who is put up against a wall in Syria does not care about Swiss law. He wants to leave as soon as possible.

What do you propose to fight against delinquency of some asylum seekers?

It is in the criminal law enforcement that we have to act. The dealers who are arrested are released an hour later because the judge must comply with the current Code of Criminal Procedure and the absurd system of daily fines.

According to you we should not reform the law on asylum?

Yes, I agree with the solutions advocated by Simonetta Sommaruga. It takes readmission agreements, like the one she has signed in Tunisia. We should also accelerate procedures with faster legal process, but only if we provide assistance to applicants. The Netherlands cut procedures short but granted a court-appointed lawyer to everyone. The third solution is to increase the number of available spots. What shocks me are the unacceptable proposals like wanting to put all applicants from emergency help, intern them or deny requests via embassies.

Why is it unacceptable?

Denying welfare to people, cutting them off, putting them in distress, this means making criminals is a downright encouragement to crime. In addition, it punishes at the same time the really persecuted asylum seekers, and that is putting everyone in jail under the pretext that there are thieves. Regardless of the ethical issues, there are the practical aspects, I am not convinced that by removing applications at embassies, we will not encourage smuggling.

But your party, the FDP-Liberals, is the one that requires the most hardening after UDC!

This is unacceptable, and especially this monstrous proposal by Philipp Müller (note, the Swiss president of FDP-Liberals) who wants to prevent family reunification for refugees already recognized by statute. In FDP, I was part of a minority, with Martine Brunschwig Graf and Dick Marty in particular, which strongly opposed to these ideas. I think the group has been had, by herd mind or lack of information. In this case, there are cowards, opportunists and those who do not understand anything. I am sorry to say that. Reread ""The Story of a German"" by Sebastian Haffner, which shows how Hitler came to power in 30 years, without ever having the majority, but thanks to the sacrifices and the cowardice of everyone. We are in that situation.

Are not you too idealistic about this topic?

No, because I do not deny the problems. They exist, but you have to take the right steps to combat them. Oskar Freysinger treated me angelica.

However, after a long consideration I decided that I will vote yes on the asylum change. Here is why:
The current system does no longer work properly. The problem aren't the amount of people that come here but the duration of the trial, the lack of space, the way justice deals with offending asylum seekers and the ""not us"" attitude of the cantons. 

This solution is far from perfect but it adresses some issues. First, it gives the federal council room to experiment. We never know what works and how good it works unless we try it out, but having a 1 year discussion followed by a ballot for every experiment (like we've had until now) is too slow. This makes it easier to search for better solutions, which is an improvement. 
It also allows the feds to change their buildings into homes for asylum seekers without the permission of the cantons, and they get to decide what kind of ""home"". I.e. special centers for people who came in conflict with the law. I don't think anybody would particularly like to live next to an asylum center, but someone has to, and the special centers allow our justice system some more options. 

I dislike that people can no longer ask for asylum in embassies and the military service thing (because it's usually much more complicated than that) but in my opinion the benefits outweigh the downsides, even if not by much.

I do agree with many of his points, but I don't really see the immediate connection between the changes to the law and a lot of what he is saying.

Principal points of contention are :

&gt;Ne sont pas des réfugiés les personnes qui, au motif qu’elles ont refusé de servir ou déserté, sont exposées à de sérieux préjudices ou craignent à juste titre de l’être. Les dispositions de la Convention du 28 juillet 1951 relative au statut des réfugiés sont réservées.

Being exposed to harm following not serving in the army is not a motive of asylum.

&gt;Quiconque dépose une demande d’asile doit être présent à la frontière suisse ou sur le territoire suisse.

Being physically present on Swiss territory is a requirement to ask for help.

&gt;Durant les phases de test, le Conseil fédéral peut raccourcir le délai de recours de 30 jours prévu à l’art. 108, al. 1, à 10 jours lorsque des mesures appropriées garantissent une protection juridique efficace des requérants d’asile concernés.

Making the procedure shorter (as short as 10 days) at the Fed. Council's discretion is possible.

true,buyacasha,zh,Zürich,"&gt; According to the UNHCR there are currently around 15 mio refugees in the world. 80% of these refugees are absorbed by third world / developping countries and not by western countries.

So the hell what? That is perfectly normal and is also what's supposed to happen. If there's a civil war in Germany I guarantee you that we would take considerably more German refugees than Kenia. That people flee to a culturally similar and geographically close country is not an indicator of who's compassionate and who's not.

&gt; Asylum seekers make up only about 0.6% of the Swiss population.

So what's the number supposed to be in your opinion? I don't get your point here.  

&gt; We seem to be fine to piss away 7 bio CHF on a Corporate tax reform we were tricked into by a former Federal Council while we were busy following the populists to go after refugees.

You do realize that this comparison is pure populism too, just from the other side? Since low taxes have been such a bad thing for our country in the past?

&gt; Switzerland did sign the Universal Declaration of Human Rights where the right of asylum is stipulated. However, in the last decades we have slowly but steady chipped away from said institution and that is why I consider our asylum legislation a cruel joke compared to what it was supposed to be.

I really do not agree there. You make it sound like we're becoming some sort of inhuman place of hell for asylum seekers, when the numbers tell a different story:  [Link to swissinfo.ch](http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/Asylum_by_the_numbers.html?cid=35231302)
