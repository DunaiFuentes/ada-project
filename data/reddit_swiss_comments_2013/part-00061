true,koebidekuehn,zg,Zug,"Not sure if this might help you, but IMO finding a job or an internship, with the opportunity of inproving your German while you're working... might be pretty damn hard, especially if you plan on working here for only 6 months. In this case I'd try different kinds of schools, either a Fachhochschule, which is kinda like college or at a Kantonsschule. I can imagine they'd need experienced people like you, from what I've read, but I'm not sure about that one.

If you plan on staying for longer than 6 months, I'd go for the high rollers, such as Abbott, Biogen Idec or Johnson&amp;Johnson. I live in Zug, and the big companies around here are always in need of new and experienced people from all over the world.

true,oelsen,bs,Basel-Stadt,"yeah, first, there is this expats bubble that we natives and non-rich immigrants hate*. second: we have &gt;1/3 of families as working poors, meaning they cant or dont know how to accumulate reserves. third, yes, the square meter living room per person has gone up, but most new condos are built for rich earning foreigners. There is no meaningful space left to use, as now the growth eats up the gains e.g. by burdening infrastructure efficiency. fourth, related to the third: urban sprawl. We even invented a word for that, the Agglomeration. Fifth: No right to self determination in Europe. What happened to Cyprus certainly would have happened to Switzerland four years ago were we in the EU, but so Switzerland could solve ITS problems in its OWN way. Now look how that went for Cyprus and Greece (same for Iceland, where the EU wanted them to pay for FOREIGN  debt). Sixth: High tech society and low tech immigrants, as well as rich, very rich immigrants into a de facto impoverishing country, within a very egality oriented society. That just does not work. 
Switzerland is not conservative. It just has a very slow system to figure out long lasting solutions. That is not compatible with those BRICS/EU/US blocks we have today. But SOMEHOW, every technical or commercial treaty finds its way here, because those with a mandate and expertise can pretty much do as they need to. Otoh, everything broader is discussed to death. This is because we trust in our gov. to fuck up; and we think everyone should do the same. Most Swiss feel that democracy is being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency.

Biggest issues are immigration (for poor and badly educated as well as rich and well educated foreigners), the watering down of the banking secret (it's gotten a bad reputation in the last few years), which will probably have an impact on our financial industries.

An evergreen is also our health care system, which is the most expensive one world wide, behind the US.

But all these issues are almost trivial compared to other countries. Economy wise we only have a slight problem with young people getting jobs. The crisis from 2008 left us almost unscathed.
