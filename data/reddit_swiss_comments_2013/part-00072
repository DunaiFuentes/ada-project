I was more than pleasantly surprised. I was laughing my ass off at it and the ending left me slack-jawed, I will definitely want to see it again. I guess there's a lot you could criticise about it, but I loved it nonetheless.

* At some point, Swiss director Samir (of no last name) made a social drama of sorts starring Zoe Miku called ""Snow White"". It was about drugs and pretty good.
* Then there was another sorta-kinda good movie called ""Jeune Homme"". It was sort of ""eh"" but good for a few chuckles.

Possibly, but that is contingent on who your employer is.

If you live in the German region, sure. 

&gt;I own guns.

Not like you are likely hoping. American gun culture is very unique in the world, and most Swiss come to their guns through their mandatory military service, as opposed to ""liking guns."" 

&gt;Enjoying living in a social society (IE, it doesn't feel weird talking to strangers)

Nope.

&gt; And it needs to be cold (I have a husky).

Make sure you like at a higher altitude then. I might suggest in the southeast.

&gt;I don't know a lot about Swiss law (IE gun control, I know Europe is pretty tight on firearms)

Best get to learning this. The Swiss are very, very serious about enforcing their laws, and the system here generally provides enormous latitude when it comes to their enforcement. There are loads of stories about five-figure traffic tickets, for instance. (in fairness, these all involve very egregious offences)
