true,korky1318,vs,Valais,"So I got this summed up from some radio talk today.

First off even if the law passes each Canton will be able to decide whether or not they apply it. And there will be only 30 gas stations or so affected by this. 

The right wing is for it as there's just a change in the range of products offered. You can buy a cervelas but not a bratwurst? wtf. They say employees won't have to work longer shifts. And it creates more job opportunities for people willing to take on night shifts. 


The left wing see it as an attempt from the right wing to slowly move toward 24/7 shops. They say it affects people. They see it as a conspiracy from the right wing to use the 'bratwurst' argument as a way of altering the opening hours of such shops completely. They say it WILL have an impact on people's shift and shit.

I seriously lean toward the right wing but don't know who to believe in the end. First I'm actually in favor of 24/7 shops. It's actually a thing that bothers me here when I come back from abroad trips. Even so, imo, gas stations should not force workers to put in more hours (if necessary, which some deny), but hire people who need a job to do it.

&gt;Vor zwei Jahren dann verletzt Carlos mit dem Messer einen Jugendlichen so schwer, dass dieser «nur dank grossem Glück überlebte».

(...)

&gt;Im «Reporter»-Film hatte ein Sozialarbeiter während eines Gruppengesprächs den Messerstecher verständnisvoll gefragt: «Willst du nicht eine Ausbildung zum Fitnesslehrer machen?»


&gt;Carlos antwortete: «Nein, schaffen kann ich nicht, sonst kann ich nicht mehr trainieren.» Die grosszügige Runde der Sozialarbeiter nickte unisono und mit sorgenvollen Mienen.

(...)

&gt;Und wie lautete die «Strafe» für den Vergehenskatalog? Carlos wurde freigelassen. «Offene Unterbringung», wie es im Jargon heisst. Konkret: 4½-Zimmer-Wohnung ((Miete: 1940 Franken)) inklusive Wasch-, Koch- und Putzdienst durch eine Ersatzmutter, Thaibox-Kurse und ein zehnköpfiges Betreuerteam mit Privatlehrer und Anwalt.

(...)
&gt;Jeden Monat fallen zu den bisherigen Kosten von einer knappen Million also weitere 29 000 Franken an. Bis spätestens 2018. Dann wird Carlos mit 22 Jahren gemäss Jugendstrafrecht automatisch aus seinem «Setting» entlassen – ohne weitere Kontrolle.
