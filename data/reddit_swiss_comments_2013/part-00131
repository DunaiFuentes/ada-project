They record everything you do, but 'anonymize' it by only attaching it to your IP address, as well as your triangulated geolocation. Then, they share it with foreign (probably US based, therefore NSA sees everything) firms to 'analyze' the data. 

Aside from the obvious privacy violations, it's utterly expensive - unless you have the Natel infinity, you pay 15 chf a month if you have a contract (only for calls *within* Switzerland), and 20 chf if you're a foreigner or don't have a contract. If you want free calls to Europe and North America, you have to either have the Natel infinity XL (170 chf/month), or pay another 25 chf. Utter bullshit. 

Even apps that are notorious for having privacy issues aren't as bad. As of summer last year, over a million people used Whatsapp in Switzerland, which is either free or you pay a one time 1 chf fee. VOIP services can be used to call to Swiss phone numbers for almost nothing - from [0.04 CHF a minute](http://progx.ch/home-voip-prixbetamax-3-1-1.html) or a couple of CHF a month for unlimited calls.
