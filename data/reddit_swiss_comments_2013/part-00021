The problem is not that those sentences could be too harsh. The real issue it that physical and sexual integrity aren't protected enough and that a rapist, for example, can get away with 1 year. And this is only for male on female rape, the other way around (what actually isn't even classified as rape) has even more ridiculously low sentences.

One year is the basic sentence. With good behavior and full prisons you'll bet out in a fraction of this. Also, I wouldn't be surprise if a lot of those sentences get converted in those 'work outside and come to prison only to sleep'-arrangements, but that's an I unfounded take. I don't think that one year is too much. If you are exceeding those high limits, you purposely risk the life of other drivers. There's no reason to tolerate that, at all.

Can the experienced 100km/h going driver predict that there will be someone who's driving way too fast: **No**

The problem is that on german roads, the drivers know, that there might be someone who goes really fast (200km/h). On swiss roads, no one expects that someone will go that fast, that's the real problem here.
