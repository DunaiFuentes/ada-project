* There are direct trains from Geneva airport to Vevey, it takes slightly more than one hour to get there. The last one leaves at 23:14, arrives at 00:31. To check train schedules, just go on [cff.ch](http://www.cff.ch) and put your departure / destination.
* The ticket will cost you 30.- (one way, so count 60.- return), you easily can buy it at ticket machines at the train station (they take cash and cards). 
* You should have plenty of time to catch your train, I never saw anyone being stopped at the custom, you just walk through and it takes about 10 seconds. The whole duty thing is if you willingly declare you have stuff not allowed (alcohol, tobacco or whatever), or if you're out of luck and get picked for inspection, which is not likely to happen at 10pm.
* Don't worry, Vevey is super nice, there you can see Lavaux vineyards and Chillon castle (google it) that are nearby, plus with your return train ticket to Geneva you can stop in any town along the way and catch another train later.
* Alternatively, if you can't afford the 60.- return ticket to Vevey, I suggest you post a request in the [last minute couchsurfing group for Geneva](http://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=28185) explaining your situation, and hopefully someone will reply and host you. Actually, I'm likely to reply to help a fellow redditor.
