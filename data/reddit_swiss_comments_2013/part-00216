Noone has the power to shut everything down and because they have to work together everyday, they also talk to each other and see points and problems from different angles. 

Another point is that the opinion of the people is more present in the government. In the United States, it is theoretically possible to become president with less than 50 percent of the votes and many people might just have voted for the smaller evil. That way, the actions of the government might not at all be accepted by the people.

true,P1r4nha,zh,Zürich,"To expand and correct that: Currently the Senate is held by the Democrats as well, the House is held by the Republicans (so the difference between Ständerat and Nationalrat in Switzerland). The blocking of government in the US is partly due to different party affiliations, but if that were the only reason, the US government would be shutdown much more often. What also plays a role is the extremist tea party which is backed by big business, lobbying and the excessive (ab)use of the [filibuster rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate) by the Republican minority in the Senate.

What you describe is the electoral college. It's controversial even in the US. It's comparable to when a president would win with the Ständemehr in Switzerland (if we would vote for a president on the national level). They don't really need that and could just vote for a president on number on votes alone. Doesn't really change a thing.

Also the two-party system you touch on is problematic, but I don't see it as the reason why we can't have one person as the head of the executive branch rather than 7. We avoid this problem through [**Consociationalism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consociationalism).

What is favorable, and probably comes with the spirit of Consociationalism, is that the head of the executive branch has **no clear party affiliation**, since it's 7 people from different parties. That is a great way of creating a **""neutral""** head of state.

true,unicornsworshipme,zh,Zürich,"Switzerland is different. In other countries democracy replaced an old kingdom or an ethnic group became independent and formed a government. Not so here: when Switzerland became a nation in 1848 it was a federation of about 25 autonomous states that were completely different: different cultures, different languages, different economies. Many of those states had been independent for over 500 years. On top of that the year before we had a small civil war because a catholic minority was afraid of a protestant-run government. So who could run such a country? What single person could become head of state and represent the Swiss? While lots of young nations need a charismatic and strong leader this is exactly what Switzerland couldn't afford. 

So they ""invented"" the Federal Council: a government of seven ministers who act together as the Head of State. Now you had representatives of different cantons, cultures and languages in the government. (Later also politicians of other religions (namely Catholics), ideologies (Conservatives and Socialists) and sexes (first women finally in 1984) got elected into the Federal Council.)

This system is pretty unique but it makes sense in Switzerland. Civil societies and cooperations have been a long tradition so the idea of having a head of state that has to cooperate makes completely sense to us. Also Swiss people don't like to get bossed around, we don't like leaders and we are suspicious of power.

Of course there are. we may not have crazy dangerous ghettos like in many other countries, but most cities have poor parts and most have rich parts. Especially zurich. It has already been mentioned tha the ""gold coast"" in zurich is where a lot of rich people, also internationally known ones, have houses/apartements.

And if you look at the bigger picture there are also different regions. Switzerland has the so called ""cantons"" which are kind of comparable to the different states in america. They are way smaller but opperate on a similar level, looking at the whole government build up. 
So there are more rural cantons like Appenzell and most of the cantons in the mountains, and there are cantons like zurich, where most people work desk jobs (a lot of banking).

Depending on the professor (I don't know how they assign them for this class), it can be really entertaining, or incredibly boring.

There's one thing you should be wary of: the coefficient. Global Studies is 4, higher than some other classes*; SHS used to be a rounding error in your final grade, now you actually have to pay attention.

*depending on your section, it might be more important than quite a few classes; the coefficient of the programming classes in Physics is 3, for instance.
