- the campaigning on the lines of ""if we don't please rich people they're all going to leave and if we don't please the banks our economy will tank""; this has been particularly efficient in Switzerland and the USA at switching the tax burden to a captive middle class who consider that they're acting reasonably and pragmatically to avoid an economic and fiscal melt-down. I don't know whether they are right or wrong in believing this but the end result is the same.

France is an interesting counter-example where the people are not afraid of pressuring their government to enact fiscal reform to raise taxes on the very rich. However, there are claims that this hurts their economy and fiscal wealth.

It's hard to tell where the truth lies in all of this, but I strongly believe that if more OECD countries had agreements to reduce the level of escaping one another's taxes, it would only make the global situation fairer for everyone.

The Bernese police explicitely said that they only published pictures of people when they could directly link said person to a crime.
They are not casting a fishing net to troll for people, they have evidence linking those persons to crimes and they are publishing those pictures to identify said persons. I have very little issue with that.
