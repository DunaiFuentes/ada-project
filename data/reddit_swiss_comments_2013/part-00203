I can comment on ETH and Basel as I've had some experience with both. ETH is tough, lots of math at the beginning and hard to pass the first year. More than half I know who attended ETH didn't pass the bachelor degree (which they want, they only want the ""best""), It's really a tough education, more school than actual studying but the degree is worth a lot.

University of Basel is smaller, not more than 20-30 new computer science students per year (compared to over 150 at ETH). They finally reached a point where the lectures are well structured and deep. You can learn the same things there as at ETH. there are 4 main directions you can choose in your bachelor degree. Although the degree is ""less valuable"" but even there I've known people who get a really high paying starting job at 8k CHF/month so I wouldn't worry about that. I'd pick what you find appealing, some might hate me for it but it's easier, you get a lot of help from the professors if you need it because the department is smaller and not so many students. Getting good grades is ""easier"".

Zurich is large, more expensive (not just living but also insurance wise, and you have to get health insurance in Switzerland it's the law). Basel is a lot smaller and I'd say cheaper but don't quote me on that.

The first semester is almost exclusively math (apart from an introduction to programming), but that gets better in the second semester already.

As others mentioned, you can't really learn Swiss German, because it's not a real language, it's just our weird way of talking German. That said, you'll be fine if you speak High German decently. You don't actually have to speak Swiss German to talk to people, although understanding it would be good, but you'll learn that quickly. There are quite a few Germans who already (after like 3 weeks in Switzerland) understand us pretty well if we don't talk too fast. All the lectures are in High German, at least in the first year. From the second year on there are also more and more English ones.

I hope that helped, if you've got any other questions I might be able to answer feel free to ask :)
