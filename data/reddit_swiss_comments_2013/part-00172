I don't see how that isn't insulting to the general population of Switzerland. This isn't a rational opinion, nor is it constructive. There is no consideration, no disposition of the different kinds of values that are held by the Swiss people. You are grossly generalizing everyone as some kind of UDC/SVP twat despite a majority of the population disliking that particular party (and I mean a majority, not the 26.6% SVP voter bullshit that you seem to acknowledge as a majority).

true,ALTSuzzxingcoh,be,73% sexist - 100% swiss (Bern),"Natürlich geht das beidseits; und im Gegensatz dazu, wie sehr ich mich immer bei Pro-WP-Argumenten aufrege, verflüchtigt sich das auch schnell, wenn der Argumentierende signalisiert, dass er nichts gegen eine wirklich ""allgemeine"" Wehrpflicht einzuwenden hätte. Nur ist für manche Leute, wie mich, die Gleichberechtigung eben häufig Kriterium Nummer eins, und es ist einfach erstaunlich, wie viele Argumente am eigentlichen Punkt vorbeizielen. Da gibt es gesetzlich vorgeschriebene Zwangsarbeit für die Hälfte der Bevölkerung und 19/20 Politikern fällt nichts besseres ein, als mit Finanzargumenten oder ideologischer Weltanschauung anzukommen. Was wäre, wenn es eine Kinderhüt- oder Gebärpflicht für Frauen gäbe?

Ausserdem finde ich so oder so, dass es falsch ist, Menschen zu Zwangsarbeit zu zwingen, die eigentlich dazu bestimmt ist, im Ernstfall Territorium ohne Rücksicht auf den eigenen Leib zu verteidigen.
