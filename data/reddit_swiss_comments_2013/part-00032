true,[deleted],null,null,"Couple of points:

- I would call it ""cantonal"" as opposed to ""state"" government, just for precision's sake
- each cantonal block has its own power breakdown (executive, legislative, judicial).  The exact name of these depends on the canton, but it's usually some form of Kantonsrat, and it's generally (always?) unicameral
- in the Bundesgericht, there's the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (administrative court, civil cases) and the Bundesstrafgericht (criminal court) as its two components.  So for example the former would hear all constitutional cases.
- I would also mention communal politics as a third high-level pillar - to simplify, national, cantonal, and communal politics deals with issues on those respective levels.  At smaller cantonal levels, there's the concept of communal democracy (Versammlungsdemokratie, I think) as opposed to electoral democracy - basically everybody gets together and votes on stuff.
- important concept:  the subsidiarity principle, meaning the federal government only takes on stuff that exceeds the abilities of the individual cantons, or which require a uniform set of rules on a national level.  Contrast this with the US Xth amendment (i.e. ""stuff not explicitly reserved for the federal government is granted to the states"" - so exactly the opposite approach).
- the executive on the national level also has the ""chancellor"" (Bundeskanzler), with equivalents on the cantonal level (e.g. ""Kantonsschreiber"") - basically chief of staff.
- the president of the Nationalrat is often referred to as the ""highest Swiss person"", even though in terms of diplomatic protocol he/she is below the president of the executive council.

_Edit:_ I'd consider drawing it something like this:

I must ask a few questions to clarify, as I had to look up a bunch of definitions of the words you said. I love your feedback and I hate asking for a lot but for myself I'm not going to half-ass this. Switzerland deserves more. So

* you said the former would see all constitutional cases as in the Bundesgericht correct? 
* The local level is first in line for law changes, using its own branches, then canton, then finally national level. Just to make sure im getting that correct.
* The chancellor is the '8th member' of the federal council correct? 
* The chancellor has equal power to his equivalent at the cantonal level? 
* I'm sorry for not understanding the German (i think no stereotyping) names, What is the Bundesrat? I'm assuming the rest when comparing them to mine. 

I cant thank you enough for piecing this together. I love Switzerland from what i know, and I admire the government structure, makes a lot more sense to secure freedoms and whatnot than most countries. I'm not asking all these questions just for a good grade but rather because I want to know more and possibly visit there with my friend's family.",0,1361231485,null,0,1361241857,0,c8hhorj,t3_18rkez,t1_c8hhorj,t1_c8hh5zx,null,1435582618,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
