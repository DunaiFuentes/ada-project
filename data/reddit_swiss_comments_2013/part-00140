The best evidence for rape is the woman's body. Bruises around ankles/arms/neck where she was forcibly held, small telltale wounds in the vaginal region and obviously DNA-traces inside her. 

What makes it so difficult to distinguish between rape and consensual sex is that sometimes the man applies huge pressure on the woman without getting violent and she doesn't struggle during intercourse. Some sings like the vaginal injuries just aren't there in those cases, and the few bruises (if any) can be challenged with ""she likes it rough"".

Huh? Giving birth is absolutely not an extraordinary circumstance. It's ridiculously common. There aren't billions of us on this planet just by ""extraordinary circumstance"".

Yes we do, I've spend enough days in those shelters to say that.
