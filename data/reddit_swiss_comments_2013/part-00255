Getting rid of the welfare system by replacing it with a basic income you would also get rid of a large part of the ""nanny state"" that is so often decried by libertarians because the basic income is unconditional. Some might use it to kill themselves with too much alcohol and others might just be able to use it to get themselves out of a tough spot and reintegrate into a productive society again.

I can't speak for the other natives but I _vastly_ prefer it when people try to learn proper German pronunciation.  It sounds goofy and grates on my ears when I hear non-native speakers massacre any dialect of Swiss, and frankly, while I think it's kind of cool and quaint to have something traditional, I don't understand the value in trying to ""learn"" it.  

You'll almost certainly never be accent-free, which is fine, but we all spend all/most of our education speaking high German, so your ""integration"" is not going to be hampered in any way by not speaking dialect, maybe except for a few random closed-minded idiots.  When someone goes to the trouble of learning proper German, I think it's generally appreciated.

That said, it's cool when immigrants can understand it spoken, and know a few key words and idioms.
