* Don't wait for a year. Make sure you visit the Alps before the end of October if you want to hike and bike. Later it will be too cold, in November there can be snow. (If you want to see cows in the Alps don't visit later than September).
* Of course, there are many beautiful hikes. But don't just climb mountains. I advise you to hike at least one pass. E.g. you can start in the morning in a country/region where people speak Italien and end up somewhere where people speak German in the evening. Blows my mind everytime!

true,unicornsworshipme,zh,Zürich,"In general the Alps are pretty good covered by trains. So I just point out some highlights. You can easily connect the dots. In two weeks you can do lots of stuff. Of course you won't be able to see all the Alps (you'd have to visit eight countries), but here are some highlights:

* Since I am Swiss, let's start in Switzerland. Interlaken in Bernese Oberland is very popular among tourists. Great views, beautiful mountains and lots of services for doing sports.

* Lucerne is a beautiful city. If you visit, do a boat trip on Lake Lucerne.

* You probably want to see the Matterhorn. Go to Zermatt. There take the beautiful Glacier Express to St. Moritz, a posh resort (but also a nice region for hiking). There the Rhätische Bahn brings you to Tirano (Italy). Another breathtaking journey.

* When in Italy: Take a boat trip on Lake Como. It's just south of the Alps and has great views. Visit Bellagio and the 
Villa del Balbianello (easy to do in one day).

* Speaking of a day trip: If you are in Switzerland and/or Austria don't miss tiny Liechtenstein. It's a principality not a lot of people visit, so you can show off ;-) Take the Bus to (relatively) remote Malbun and do the Princess Gina Trail.

* Speaking of Austria: I've never been hiking in Salzburg, but the city is worth a visit. You know, the Sound of Music...

* From Salzburg take a local bus. 45 Minutes later you are in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, Germany! If you are a history buff, you should visit Obersalzberg and the Kehlsteinhaus. The Watzmann in the National Park is very popular hike. A boat trip on the Königsee is also a must!

* Unfortunately I don't know what to visit in the French Alps. Just remember: there the Alps reach the Mediterranean. So technically a city trip to Monte Carlo is also a trip in the Alps...

* You also want to look up South Tyrol. It's an interesting region: the people are from an Austrian heritage but the region is part of Italy. So you have the best of two worlds. They have also beautiful mountains and a great infrastructure. And don't forget Slovenia. Never been there, but places like Bled look so beautiful.

The best way to travel in the Alps is by train and bus. You'll find timetables and prices for example at [SBB](http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html) (Switzerland) and [ÖBB](http://www.oebb.at/en/index.jsp) (Austria). If you travel a lot or long distances, you may want to buy an [Eurail Pass](http://www.eurail.com).

While not every local speaks English, most resorts provide information in English on their Websites.

* I don't like maps covered with pins. Though I will more likely make the pin appear when hovering over the ad.

Again, thank you so much for the time you took to comment. That was super useful, and I am going to implement your recommendations pretty quickly. Well first I am going to add a new feature that uses OpenStreetMap to show all amenities in a given area. As another user mentioned it, http://meter-square.com is still not very different from other websites, it focuses too much on prices, not on guiding users to areas they may like.

The main concern is that pieces of latex can be a choking hazard for wild life. But the second website says there is now studies that would confirm that fishes or animal are choking on pieces of ballons.

I think cars kill way more toads and hedgehog than a few ballons.

&gt; 
&gt; *Last thursday Sunrise let fly 30'000 balloons in Zürich. It was a publicity stunt, which turned out as a flop.*
&gt; 
&gt; Last thursday the telecom company Sunrise let fly 30'000 balloons on Stadthausquai in Zürich. It looked colourful, but the whole publicity stunt, which was intended as a thank you because of the positively rated service, had bad consequences for the environment.
&gt; 
&gt; For what rises in the air beautifully in Zürich comes down again somewhere else - namely in the mountain areas south-east of Zürich, 'mountain wilderness' writes in a press notice.
&gt; 
&gt; **Threat for animals**
&gt; 
&gt; According to several tour reports a lot of balloon rests in the questionable colours from yellow over orange to purple and cords were found around lake Wägi in the snow. Until these plastic rests are degraded, years can pass according to 'mountain wilderness'.
&gt; 
&gt; They present a threat for wildlife and pollute summering meadows. 'All in all Sunrise's marketing department did not think their publicity stunt through to the end and is now polluting - probably unwillingly - meadows and forests. This is scandalous for a company this big', says Katharina Conradin, manager of 'mountain wilderness' Switzerland.
&gt; 
&gt; **Balloons all right, cords not so much**
&gt; 
&gt; As the press notice by Sunrise over 'Blick' said, The company takes the environmental matter very seriously. One has therefore 'thoroughly clarified the aspects of littering and environment before the balloon-stunt. The balloons consist of purely natural rubber and are therefore non-toxic and biodegradable and environmentally sustainable.'
&gt; 
&gt; It looks differently with the cords. 'Unfortunately no biodegradable materials were used for the cords and clasps, which we regret', the media spokesman says to 'Blick'. ",0,1386620695,null,0,false,0,cdxmy70,t3_1sgux3,t1_cdxmy70,t1_cdxhgx0,null,1428323601,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4

With the cold weather, they won't go away soon. Moreover, the cord and the plastic lock aren't (and Sunrise even confirmed that on FB - [screenshot here](http://i.imgur.com/leaR7P7.jpg)).
If some animals eat those, they surely risk health problems.

So, IMO, the problem stays together with the littering one.

By the way, a lot of things are biodegradable by nature, still dispersing them is forbidden (poo for example is very biodegradable).

As of animals, young cows will try to eat everything they find (that's among other things is why farmers are so angry about litter in fields). You don't need any special study to find it out, suffice to go in the fields in the spring. I suppose mountain farmers near Zurich are angry now. I don't know about deer, but we can assume hunger plus curiosity may force them to try too. They give birth in spring too.

And, as you said, litter is a major problem. 30000 balloons is huge, people here are fined for much less. I hope they will not just walk away like that with it.

They are clearly in a bad situation now. Big pr nightmare hihi.

without a cord and plasic thing, do you think it has a real impact on wild life? It's easy to see how glass bottle and cans are trap for small animals, I've seen a few bottle that fill up with water and when a mouse or lezard get in it can't come out and drown.

true,unicornsworshipme,zh,Zürich,"&gt; Is it common for people to camp along the way while they travel the alps?

Of course you'll find many camping sites. But apart from that it's a bit tricky. I think in Austria it's forbidden. In Germany and Switzerland it depends on the Bundesland/Kanton/state. And even if you are allowed to camp in general it still is forbidden in wildlife sanctuaries. Or you stay somewhere away from the civilization, only to find out that you are on private property. 

I don't say it's not possible. And some people do it. Just make sure you ask locals before you do something like that. 

More popular (at least here in Switzerland) is staying in huts. The Swiss Alpine Club has huts all over Switzerland. There you find basic accommodation (mostly in dormitories, but sometimes they have also double rooms), shelter, food and a shower. It's cheap and basic, maybe a bit too basic for many tastes but you should try it. A list of huts in Switzerland is [here](http://www.sac-cas.ch/en/huts/search-a-hut.html?noMobile=1). Just make sure you have a reservation before you go.
