It's mainly that I've moved countries _a lot_, and also have a lot of foreign-born friends in Switzerland (not to mention generally knowing a pretty international crowd in the countries I move to).

It comes with the territory that many people don't plan their moves, and even when you think you are pretty inured to the downsides of moving to a new country, you can be surprised by how you fail to ""click"" with the culture or various logistical aspects.  It sucks, because it seriously fucks up what would otherwise be a great experience.  I just spent an hour last week listening to and comforting an expat friend who's been utterly lonely and miserable in Switzerland, and he's by far not the first.  Even when you're perfectly OK dealing with all the obvious differences (you know, how things are done differently), there can still be intangible stuff like homesickness, loneliness, feeling adrift, that are part of moving around.

As for the fast track for the Swiss passport, be sure that you will be able to show strong ties with Switzerland, since the condition is very restrictive (case-law says it is reserved to ""exceptional cases"", when it would be ""shocking"" for the spouse not to get the passport in the particular case).

So I'm afraid, you'll have to wait 4 more years, but you can still try to ""get"" the ties in the mid-time -- have a cuckoo-clock in your living room of instance ^just ^kidding .

Still a bummer. I have heard too many stories of phones just taking ages to get repaired, or even getting returned after weeks on end with the same problem still there. 

Luckily I haven't had too much trouble myself with phones, welp I've owned 3 so far but when I broke the screen of my S3 I sceptically brought it to some arabic dude who had a small ""mobile"" shop and he repaired it within a day for 150chf. Fair enough right.

Its all a massive fucking fraud. And one thing is clear: Mobilezone lost a pretty good customer with me.

I remember a few years ago buying an insured phone through Sprint in the US. The phone they sent me wouldn't turn on. The contractor that handles the returns required I pay for the full phone and get refunded by Sprint. The new phone I got also wouldn't turn on, same problem. Had to go through the same process again. The second time around they fucked up and charged me twice. The refund process ultimately took three months and over 24 hours in customer service phone calls, leaving me with the interest on over $2000 in charges and about $100 charges on phone calls to the contractor. Also, I didn't have a working phone for a month. Needless to say, I never buy insurance any more and I try to buy phones off contract.
