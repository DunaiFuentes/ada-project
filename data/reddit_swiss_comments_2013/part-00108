It's hard to be more precise than that because anything I'd say would be based on stereotypes and those usually don't fare with individuals.

For example, I could say Swiss girls are probably more reserved and less direct than Scottish girls. They probably are also going to drink less alcohol than Scottish girls.

Edit: I dug a bit more and to apply fully to any university in Switzerland you need to meet  [these criterias](http://www.crus.ch/information-programme/recognition-swiss-enic/zulassung/zulassung-in-der-schweiz/individual-countries/usa.html?l=1&amp;L=2).

true,notanotherclairebear,null,null,"It also depends what you want to do and where you want to go. Really, it is difficult, and most difficult to get into the job market here if you do not have EU citizenship. Even job offers for the most part have to be offered first to a Swiss person, then to the EU, before being offered to someone from outside. Also, unless you speak French or Switzerdeutsch you will also find it quite difficult job-wise, as English is not an official language here.

That said, again it depends... For eg, I work at CERN near Geneva, but live across the border in France where it is much cheaper. Not much of a night life though (well neither is Geneva really) but much better cost-wise.
