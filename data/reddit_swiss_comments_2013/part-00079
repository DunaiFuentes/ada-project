Furka sometimes opens in early May and sometimes end of the first week in July - it really depends on the weather. Others might open earlier - some are already open, the ones you listed are the highest up and therefore the ones with the coolest weather and usually the most snow.

If the ones you list don't work out, try to find ones that aren't as high up, so you can still enjoy those.

true,hubraum,world,Absurdistan,"On twisty roads, such as passes, motorcycle are inherently faster than cars. Motorcycles accelerate faster than cars anyway, so it's better to just let them pass when possible (by driving slower and indicating right or giving a hand signal). 

They'll overtake you sooner or later anyway, so if you let them pass where it's safe, they'll be thankful for that. The only other option they have is to wait until they can outrun you (on a straight) or stay behind you and be annoyed they can't drive. It feels like waiting behind a tractor.

I don't mean every car now has to give priority to motorcycles, it's just something you can do which doesn't cost you a lot but makes someone happy and is possibly safer for both of you.

Btw, some bikers let their right leg hang out after they pass you, which   means ""thank you"".

true,hubraum,world,Absurdistan,"You're welcome, and if you don't mind - since we're talking about motorcycles and cars:

Always always use your indicators. If you're slowing down with the intent to turn left but are not using your blinkers, many motorcyclists will overtake you (again, the acceleration is just there). Use your indicators before you turn left, use them to indicate (doh!) to the guys behind AND in front of you (for example for the other motorcycle you might have overseen).

If you're driving too close to a motorcycle you will scare them. Cars take a dent if you cannot brake fast enough, motorcyclists might lose a limb. Honestly, if I have someone to close behind me (on my bike), I'll overtake the next guy until I have someone behind me who keeps his distance, I'm that scared.
