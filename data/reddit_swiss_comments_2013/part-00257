I assume you're pretty young. Research papers, especially once you hit university, require sources. Reddit generally would not count as one, nor would Wikipedia, but Wikipedia has citations which are great to work off of. I suggest you take a look around the Internet then come back here for clarification on what you find.

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Switzerland) is your Wikipedia to start.
