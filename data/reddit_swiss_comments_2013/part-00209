Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.

&gt;If more people have more money

Only those receiving benefits would have more money but those paying taxes (if you keep a balanced budget) or those lending to the state (if you deficit spend) would have less money so inflation would be unaffected.

true,barlavon,null,null,"I agree. Even today if you work from home you make huge economies:

* you can choose where to live, both better quality and cheaper;
* you don't have to commute, don't need GA or car (incl. car insurance, tax, technical control, tires and gas);
* eating at home makes huge difference, again both for quality and price (like 20.- x 20 workdays = 400.- and  you still need to eat in the evening/weekends);
* you control your time better, so you can buy things where/when they are cheaper.

Now, let's say your income is 2500.- and you pay 1000.- for housing, 250.- for food and 250.- for insurances, you will still have 1000 for the rest. (NB: In today's system health insurance will be refunded by state.)

If you not living alone savings are even bigger.

true,P1r4nha,zh,Zürich,"ETHZ is one of the top universities worldwide. They're just bad at PR that's why nobody really seems to know it.

I don't think your college diplomas are compatible with our Matura, which means that you need to do an entrance exam. For the Bachelor you also need to know German, since most courses in the Bachelor years are in German.

In Switzerland everybody who finished secondary-school and got a Matura can go to ETH Zürich without a entrance exam. That's why the first year is usually a bit crowded. After the first semester around 40% of students drop out. That depends however on which course you take. Unlike other universities the courses are fixed for the first two years with very few possibilities for individual choices, it gets better in the third year before your Bachelor. I did Electrical Engineering, which has another 40% drop out rate in the second year. After that it's much more chill. EE counts (or counted) as the hardest field at ETHZ, but the other courses aren't to be taken lightly either.

The Master is much more open and you can choose courses individually.

Overall the school provides very theoretical courses on most fields of engineering. Very new fields fall a bit short usually. I know of people with a very special academic career that was only possible in their year and got changed up later on. That's not too bad however if you do a rather conventional course.

Living in Zurich is expensive. You might be able to get some student housing for 450 to 600CHF/month ($500 - $650). If not you have to fight for a room in a shared apartment. Dormitories are almost non-existent and all rooms are for one person only. I don't know anybody who had to share their room with somebody else. The apartment however, sure, that's a common thing.

Food is also expensive. You won't be eating out a lot, so some cooking skills are important. You can also eat at the cafeteria on campus. A week of groceries cost me about 80CHF ($90), but I'm sure you can get cheaper.

Standard of living in Zurich however is awesome. It's small, easy to get around (great public transportation) and there's a lot of nature. It's normal to swim in the lake or the river of Zurich in the middle in the city. The water is very clear.

There is almost no crime. You won't get into trouble and even being out at night in sleazy areas is usually safe. Theft is common, but not robbery, so take care of your things.",0,1381141799,null,0,false,0,ccmoibg,t3_1nvan2,t1_ccmoibg,t3_1nvan2,null,1429217269,8,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,8
