true,buyacasha,zh,Zürich,"Well, I'm not exactly a mountain buff so my perspective is quite limited. But here are two options that I can suggest. Go to [Lucerne](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=luzern&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=59.379225,62.841797&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Lucerne,+Canton+of+Lucerne,+Switzerland&amp;z=13) (That's about a one hour train ride from Basel / the German border). There you'll find numerous hotels and what not. From there, take the train to [Alpnachstad](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Alpnachstad,+Alpnach,+Switzerland&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=46.95388,8.276417&amp;spn=0.012699,0.015342&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=59.379225,62.841797&amp;oq=alpnachs&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Alpnachstad,+Alpnach,+Obwalden,+Switzerland&amp;z=16) (doen't take long) and hop onto the Pilatus cable car train. Get off at the middle station Ämsigen and walk up to the top of the mountain from there. Then drive down with the cable car (since walking up is generally more enjoyable. But this can be reversed of course). Pilatus is not part of the alps though, but still pretty beautiful with an [awesome view](https://www.google.com/search?q=pilatus+aussicht&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=wxoaUbN1xsmzBsuUgbAE&amp;biw=1096&amp;bih=967&amp;sei=xBoaUaXNG4XFtAbImYCYBw#um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=d&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=pilatus+view&amp;oq=pilatus+view&amp;gs_l=img.3...5851.6231.0.6331.4.4.0.0.0.0.85.308.4.4.0...0.0...1c.1.2.img.TUaF95sqlZI&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.42261806,d.Yms&amp;fp=a5677f8b83f93fe3&amp;biw=1096&amp;bih=967).

An other option I like is going to [Brienz](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=brienz&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=46.751623,8.040276&amp;spn=0.101973,0.122738&amp;sll=46.980077,8.258371&amp;sspn=0.05077,0.061369&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Brienz,+Canton+of+Bern,+Switzerland&amp;z=13) (Which is much cooler than the Pilatus one, but the Pilatus route is closer to Lucerne, which is worth a visit all by itself too) and then walk up to the Brienzer Rothorn or alternatively take the [awesome cable car](https://www.google.com/search?q=brienzer+rothorn+view&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=1RsaUb3JGMvHswbRm4HoCg&amp;biw=1096&amp;bih=967&amp;sei=2BsaUZ2_GIrXswa9yICYBw).
