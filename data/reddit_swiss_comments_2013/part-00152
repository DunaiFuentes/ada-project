I am the product of (mostly) state-run schools in both Switzerland and the US, and my education was generally excellent - but both were in a cultural context of independence from the state.  My experience living in the Netherlands, Germany, and France, and dealing with people in Scandinavian countries, leads me to believe that there is a much much greater acceptance than even in Switzerland that ""the government is a good thing and works and can be trusted"".  

I like the fact that there are things that are publicly funded, which allow me to live a safe and comfortable life, knowing that most of my fellow citizens are taken care of at least at a basic level - education, healthcare, housing, food, transportation, safety are all wonderful areas to have good public support for, and I believe that my government is both fairly accountable to the public (rather than technocratic and paternalistic) and spends my money responsibly.  That is why I happily pay my taxes.

But once you start getting into areas that (a) undercut competition, (b) are founded on obsolete business models, (c) disregard available alternatives, and (d) have the potential for, frankly, producing the kind of shit that you describe, I get annoyed.

Our main way to influence the political field are through Initiatives and Referenden (singular: Referendum). This is a process where people go out on the street and collect a set amount of signatures from people who are allowed to vote, and then there is a national vote on the issue where every citizen can say Yea or Nay to an issue. 

For example the next national vote is on the 22nd of September. There we have an initiative (that means people signed something and said ""we want this to happen"") about the abolishment of the compulsory military service (it will not stand a chance but it's nice that we get to vote on it again). We also have a Referendum (that means something passed the vote in parliament but enough people signed a paper and said ""We do not want this"" so it's now put to national vote to see if the law passes or not) about animal epidemies (which I dearly hope does not pass). We also have a vote about how long gas stations can keep their shops open - that's an automatic national vote because it changes the constitution.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Thanks - familiar with the referendum et al, but was mainly wondering about the direct parliamentary process and our interactions with them.  

Many politicians tend to be a bit ""abgehoben"", particularly on issues that they're not very well informed about - we vote for them based on some fairly general stances and party lines, but when it comes down to specific issues that might not attract broad enough interest for a referendum, I get the impression that the minority of people affected by such topics don't really have a voice.

A great example is the panicky debate about laser pointers that were used by some rioting idiots (in Basel, sorry :D) to try and blind police.  Rather than treating this as common hooliganism and assault, as you would deal with someone hitting you with a pointy stick, a bunch of politicians now want to ban powerful laser pointers and collimators.  I am a hobby astronomer who uses these; powerful 100+mw green lasers are the best way to sight telescopes visually.  But try getting something that niche across...

Or the ""Killerspiele"" silliness - you often get a few politicians with their views, investing a lot of time and energy into pushing their ideas, while the rest either don't care or understand enough and thus allow themselves to be swayed by how the debate is framed.  There's no way it's big enough to justify a referendum or running for office, so the only way a citizen can try to contribute is by providing facts and studies to their politicians.

In any case, it is always a good idea to remind career politicians that they ultimately answer to voters, and to remind voters that they are responsible for keeping their politicians honest.

I don't have many people in my environment that are politically interested and active.

The idea was that you need a system where you discuss in a way that avoids grandstanding and insults in favor of actual, factual discussion. If you look at the [media discussion in /r/Switzerland](http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1iyfp8/should_local_media_in_switzerland_be_subsidized/) at the moment you can see a good example of that.

If I look at Politnetz, it has a very blog-like structure and for me it doesn't seem to emphasize discourse and discussion, but it's a Blog. The actual post seems to be most important. That way the politicians (or everybody, actually) can have their own online soapbox to promote an issue, which is good, but the comments should be the actual interesting part, like here on Reddit.

For instance I've not seen a good method on *any* site except for Reddit that creates such a nice and neat way of hierarchy for comment threats. And the comment section in blogs (like newspaper websites and also politnetz) is usually messy and not so easy to navigate. Often people rather make the same point in their own individual comment, than commenting on an already existing comment to add to it. Also if there is finally some kind of discourse, it's kind of hard to understand who is responding to whom and it's not easy to way in into a discussion because of that. Reddit solves this really nicely.

Not sure if I'm for a voting system like the one on Reddit, but a function like that might not be so bad. Some kind of order, or hierarchy for comments would be great.",0,1374844721,null,0,false,0,cbaor3f,t3_1j30jk,t1_cbaor3f,t1_cbaoa2z,null,1430329132,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

The practice of corresponding with politicians is simply not as established as in other countries because a.) we have other options to influence politics (initiatives/referendums) and b.) our Milizparlament, which means they just don't have a lot of time for such things.

As for your second paragraph, I agree with your sentiment, but again I think your expectations aren't really fair ;-) It's quite a big step from learning the basics (which I'm sure they all know), to really grokking online interactions and how to use social media effectively. And politicians simply cannot be experts about all the topics they vote on, that's why they have to work together and consult people that actually *are* experts in a given field.

As for social media - don't get me wrong, I am not expecting my Nationalräte to turn into Twitter fiends - but I do believe it's fair to expect someone to at least take notice of emails that appear to have had some thought put into them.

The reason for this is precisely because I find elections and initiatives / referendums to be insufficient for topics which may be important to a small minority on either side of the issue, but where the minority on one side has vastly more time and motivation to push their point across than the other.  

The laser pointer example is actually quite a good one here - there are a very few politicians who make a very strong push for banning these - because making such a push is what they are paid for.
