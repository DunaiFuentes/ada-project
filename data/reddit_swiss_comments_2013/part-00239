It scares me that the Initiative doesn't get enough attention because 1:12 is so controversial. It seems so logical and just at first glance. At second sight it seems to be traditionalism against modern family. In the end, it is only about shifting huge piles of money to those who can already afford to raise their children at home.

When it comes to family-planning, many people face the decision children vs. career. With daycare, people can have both. Note that the initiative only targets the conflict children vs. money, and does not help to productively integrate capable mothers (and fathers) into our work society.

true,Winkelried,be,Bern,"To 2): some things you will probably find bad and miss horribly. Customer service is just nowhere near US standards. Product variety is significantly lower. Especially food. People are not as communicative. It's hard to make friends (there was just a study done recently).

Other things I think are as good/better: cleanliness, food quality, general safety, no car centered cities, cellphone reception everywhere,  good public transportation, you can drink a beer on a public place or in the train, I think that the political system is working for the people, Even though we have a state religion the population is secular, internet is fast. The internet is also the solution to low product or service variety (keep you american credit card!)
