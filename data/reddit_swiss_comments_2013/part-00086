Zurich: expensive, but has a lot to offer. I personally love to go in bars in the ""Niederdörfli"". It's a street near the river / beginning of the lake with old houses and littles bars etc. You can also go grab a beer at the Langstrasse, which is on the other side of the lake, near the main station. 
Bern: You can just find many bars in the small streets around the main station. The bar I like the most is called Turnhalle and is maybe 5-10 min from the station. Bern is not that expensive as Zurich!
Lausanne: Here I would take the metro for 2 stations and then there is a street with bars nearby.
