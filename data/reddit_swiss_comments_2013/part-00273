true,bernerTman,null,null,"They are fabulous but definitely have their downsides.  They need to be socialized a LOT as puppies as they can otherwise develop fear reactions.  They were breed as watch dogs but are not ""guard"" dogs per se.  Totally echo the comments about the health issues.  Oh, and the shedding is epic with this breed - year around. Don't believe anyone who tells you otherwise.  We say you know the food is homemade if there is dog hair in it.  So if your folks are particular about having a tidy house then this is probably not the breed for them.  Would highly recommend going to BMDCA.org for more info as well as breeder referrals and club listings.  Contact your regional BMD club - the people are usually really friendly and eager to help you understand the pros and cons of the breed.  You can go to club events to meet the dogs and talk to their people.  ",0,1387250331,null,0,false,0,ce3kguf,t3_1obzrd,t1_ce3kguf,t3_1obzrd,null,1428100730,1,false,SwissMountainDogs,t5_2vu9g,1

true,DeepBlueNemesis,bs,Beide Basel,"Man, I never saw a picture that managed to capture as little of the Münster as this one. I'm not trying to diss the photographer by any means, but trying to fit three seperate elements (the Münster, the tree and the moon) into one vertical picture really hurt the overall appeal. Some constructive critisism: Always think about focal points. There is none in this picture, which makes the house in the background kinda awkward because it's stronger than the tree to the right. I like the lighting of this, with the exception of the moon (those kind of smudge effects are associated with stars or streetlights, when portraying the moon most people try to avoid any sort of effect except maybe a glow around its edges). 

Too bad we didn't see any of the colored roof tiles, but this picture made me get up from the couch and go christmas shopping.
