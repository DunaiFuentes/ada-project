By the way, I did a bit of searching out of curiosity.  There are a couple of issues regarding one of your other attempts to pre-emptively address objections.

- air pollution:  the issue isn't so much that there's only pollution once a week (plus trainings/tests).  It's that it's extremely intense in terms of particulate matter (Feinstaub).  There's also the issue of pollution caused by traffic around the event - to be fair, this is no more than you'd get at, say, a big football match, except that a race track would have to be built in the middle of nowhere for a variety of reasons, and unless you're willing to spend a _lot_ of money to run a train line there, you're not going to get nearly the same use of public transportation.

- noise pollution:  you mention noise baffles and 100dB limits.  The closest I could find was the Nürburgring - which clocks at around 150-160dB for DTM races.  Standing right next to a busy highway, you get approx. 80dB.   Don't forget that the noise also comes in bursts - who wants their Sundays punctuated by VROOM VROOM?  It's enough having to listen to the fucking church bells and shooting ranges already...and because of space issues, it's unavoidable that you'll have one or more built-up areas nearby.

- ground pollution:  you mention special sand and tarmac.  You'll never get it all, just (hopefully) most of it.  There's going to be all kinds of run-off - dirty water, oil, petrol.  I don't imagine it would be enough to cause serious ground water pollution, but still, it is not a pleasant mix.  Anytime you get a lot of people + cars together, there's going to be a bit of a mess - it's inevitable.  

- space:  there really _isn't_ that much open space in Switzerland that's free for construction.  A race track, let's face it, isn't a particularly pretty thing.  The areas where you could build such a beast would be limited due to terrain - most likely somewhere around the Mittelland.  This means that, even if you do find a big enough area that's uninhabited (Nürburgring is about 65 km^2, Silverstone about the same, even a small track would still be huge) you'll end up wiping out a lot of forest or farmland.  Again, you also need all the peripheral infrastructure - mainly parking and access roads.  It's not just a question of building a big-ass long track.

...so there you have it.  That's the kind of thing you'll be confronted with, in addition to the (IMHO very Swiss and shitty) attitude of ""it's not necessary!""  There are some serious practical concerns that would make me personally, as someone who has an occasional, casual enjoyment of motor racing, not want a race track in the country.",0,1365618135,null,0,false,0,c9cgnqg,t3_1c1ui9,t1_c9cgnqg,t1_c9cf7g2,null,1431604974,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5

true,lurw,zh,Zürich,"Those are some valid points. Let me adress them:

- You may be right here, nothing really to argue about, although I think we are way too pretentious when it comes to pollution in our country. A little bit of racing won't hurt the earth, driving our huge SUVs to work and back does. Also, there is a growing scene of purely electric racing trophies. They don't make any noise and don't emit any gasses or fluids to the environment.

- When I said 100 dB I meant during trackdays. Obviously DTM, F1 and MotoGP are much louder. But races like this wouldn't take place every weekend, maybe a few times a year.

- It is inevitable, but every street, every parking lot and pretty much every inhabited area suffers from this. I wouldn't consider this a valid reason against a race track as it's too minor, but that's just me.

- You are right again, although the Nürburgring is one huge track. The Nordschleife itself is huge, while the GP part of it is fairly small. If you look at the newly built [Circuit of the Americas in Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_of_the_Americas) then it only takes up a bit less than 4 km^2 - really not that much! When talking about race tracks I mean GP-size, not Nordschleife-size.

Yes, electric racing would address this to a huge degree - all the pollution I mentioned.  It would be pretty awesome, actually.

I loathe SUVs - but unless you're driving the biggest Cayenne/X5/whatever petrol fuckyoumobile, the emissions are only marginally higher than many regular passenger cars.  I've got a 12-year-old Audi TT 1.8, which gets worse gas mileage than many SUVs.  I just hate them because they block my view and the drivers tend to be douches (and a douche driving an SUV is worse for traffic than a douche in a small car).

The comparison with other built-up areas isn't that good - because remember that you've got a huge amount of traffic and build-up, and unless you're _right_ on a highway, even a busy road isn't going to be nearly as loud.  It might not bother you, but if I owned property next to where a track was to be built, I'd be pretty pissed.

And agreed about the size - but again, 4km^2 is 2x2km - that is still a _big_ patch of turf.  

Your idea about building something to handle track days as a ""steam valve"" is something I find pretty sensible.  My main objection would be to something used for commercial races.

true,Dw0,bs,Basel-Stadt,"As far as I understand, the 5 rappen still exists only because the B-post stamp costs .85 and post can't change that. They're still in use, but it's quite seldom for a price to be rounded to it. I just checked with random supermarket sales and from 16 articles only 3 are priced something .95, the rest is 10 rappen based.

Until recently the only non-personal (read embarrassment-free) way to get rid of the .05 was post stamp selling machines, but they quietly got rid of them.

true,pyr,vd,Vaud,"Enjoy some sight-seeing and wine tasting by lake geneva in the lavaux area near Lausanne (there are english-speaking wine tasting tours that are worth it).

Drive to interlaken through grimsel pass from there (a detour but well worth it) and then take the train up to grindelwald then to jungfraujoch (which takes you to approx 13k feet)

Throw in a visit to zermatt, then enjoy lucerne and zurich.
The national park in grison is also well worth it.

Additional ideas:

* ticino is beautiful as well
* the gruyeres castle and surroundings are worth a visit
* if you like active things there's a bunch of via-ferratas (easy aid climbing) to look into. day hikes all over the country as well

all-in-all, lots to do :)
