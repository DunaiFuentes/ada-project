Uhm... I wish I could use photoshop on a decent level, but there are two different problems out here:

1. The school itself: bad reputation, for sure. You can get discriminated for going to this school (plenty of people told me about that, I just realized it too late). I could technically delete it from the CV, but I would need a backup for it. With my low experience, it is impossible to do so.

2. It is illegal: These things can backfire pretty hard. And if I would get punished for it... then it's totally lost.

I think my main problem is, that my CV has no credibility whatsoever. No one would believe me, if I said I did this apprenticeship by myself because:

a) I have (sadly) a pretty famous albanian last name, which seems to be not that bad at first. I know we have a lot of football players from the ""Balkan"" and they are very respected, but hear me out. I have never accomplished something great to be remembered. Some of them still think I am rude and shouldn't be in Switzerland.

b) In combination with my origin, I actually paid for my apprenticeship and I wouldn't have survived a normal one. and More than 60% of the students (at least on my school) are foreigners. Also this particular school had some serious problems with the police (I've heard that a year after my graduation) so...
