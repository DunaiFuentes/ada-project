For this topic, the climate is liberal. I have seen a lot of gays around, and there is very little random violence in general. 

&gt;Another thing is that I'm gluten intolerant. Is it going to be hard to manage this dietary requirement, or will there be things in Switzerland for me? I don't use most of the gluten free ""products"", but I do need to buy assortments of gluten free/specialty flour like almond flour, garbanzo bean flour, etc. And for reference, what is the product selection like? Sometimes it's nice to buy a pack of gluten free Oreo-like cookies, or something else that's difficult to make at home. 

I can't speak specifically about gluten free, but almost none of the products in the supermarkets are labelled in English. Generally they will be labelled in German, French, and Italian. So if you don't already speak one of these languages, you should learn the important words for things you would like to buy. 

&gt;Does anyone know if there are any government programs for people looking to get into the agriculture industry? In America the government awards grants and stuff for meeting X requirements (I don't know what they are, my girlfriend would.. She wants to start a farm). Would my girlfriend be able to make any money off of agriculture? In America most of the market is dominated by giant mega-farms that cost billions of dollars. I have some money, but obviously not that much.. Additionally, she would be looking mostly at doing dairy and wool. Cows, goats, sheep. She's also looking at keeping bees and selling the honey, and growing however many produce she can manage. 

You face two problems there, depending on your citizenship. The first is the work visa. It's not possible, as a citizen of a ""3rd country"" (i.e. non-EU) to move to Switzerland to become self-employed without a serious about of money invested. The second problem, is that there are restrictions on the sale of property to foreigners. You cannot buy more than 3000sqm (a bit more than half an acre) unless you have a C permit, which you will only receive after living and working 7 years in Switzerland. Land is extremely expensive in Switzerland, due to the extremely crowded nature of the country (high population and small size). The government does subsidise farmers, but for a foreigner to actually get the right permits to own (or rent) and work on a farm is virtually impossible. At the very least, it would involve a lot of time, money, and jumping through a lot of hoops. 

&gt;Lastly, marijuana. I know it's not legal, but how strictly is it enforced? Is it easy, or hard to get a hold of? Will I be okay as long as I'm not walking around outside with a huge bong (not my thing, I really just like to stay in my house)?

Most people live in apartments, and I'm guessing you will as a student too. So it depends how much of the smell wafts into your neighbours open windows, and whether they are annoyed or not.
