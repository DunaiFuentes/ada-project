You can take a look at the old botanical gardens and the canals in Zürich. Just bring an umbrella if it rains, I think it's rather interesting because I'm not used to canals but you may have different views. It's also close to Hallenbad so you can swim inside if it's raining instead of in the lake.

If you want a more touristy swimming experience you can go to the thermal baths. It's afaik an old brewery transformed into what the name says, thermal baths. There are some nice jacuzzis in the basement and you can also take an elevator to the rooftop which has a nice relatively warm pool/jacuzzi all over it with a nice view. I think it's nice to experience it once but I thought the price was a bit too high for what I experienced (but I'm used to better/cheaper pools where I come from).

You can go to the Zoo, it's rather decent and there are also quite a lot of nice trails on the small mountain the zoo is located on.

You can go see the wildlife park, I think train S2 goes there if I'm correct.

If you're interested you can also take a look at the universities, some of the buildings can be interesting but I wouldn't do this unless it was a last resort since I'd favor the other options strongly over this.",0,1371985632,null,0,false,0,caoivbq,t3_1gwi2k,t1_caoivbq,t3_1gwi2k,null,1430712841,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4
