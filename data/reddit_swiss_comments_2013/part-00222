true,ughthat,ar,Appenzell Ausserrhoden,"For me personally the biggest factor are working conditions. First, you can't make a decent living in most vocational jobs that are very common in Switzerland. Depending on which part of the country you live in you will have a very hard time making ends meet if you are a butcher, baker, carpenter, etc. If you look at the other end of the spectrum, engineering jobs, etc may pay well, but those fields are extremely competitive. Combine that with the fact that the laws generally afford many more protections to employers and very little to employees and you'll see where this is headed. Labor in the US is largely an expendible resource and 60-80 hour weeks are now the now largely the norm rather than the exception. Refuse to work on weekends? Too bad, we'll get the next guy in line. So while you may be able to afford that car or that house you better not plan on having too much of a life. Oh, and you best not be getting sick either because one broken arm may very well push you into financial ruin (even if you have insurance). This is obviously a generalization, and there certainly are exceptions to this.

I think living in the US is great when you are in your 20s (certainly was for me) trying to get experience and leave your mark.

It's 2004, and the Iraq foobar is in full effect. I'm on what was actually my first trip to the US - a few days in San Francisco, then rent a car and head out into the yonder. As part of the trip I decide to drive across northern Nevada on US50. One of the most isolated corners of the continental US, with nothing for a couple of hundred miles or more between Fallon and Eureka.

Being dumb, I fail to fill the car with gas in Fallon, but instead decide to press on to Eureka, where I'm spending the night. About 100 miles in I get nervous at the idea of running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere and start looking out for somewhere to fill up.

There is somewhere - a tiny bar/motel/gas station beside the road, with one pump and the gas tank on the ground next to it. I pull up and stick my head round the door of the bar. 

Everything goes suddenly quiet, like in a Western when John Wayne walks into the saloon. A row of men in cowboy hats seated along the bar turn to stare at me. ""Um, hi. Should I just pump my own gas?""

Sure, says the barman, so I head out and fill up before heading back in to pay. When I head back in everyone is looking at me again, still in stony silence and with an air of faint aggression in the air.

I pay for the gas, and the guy at the bar nearest me fixes me with a look. ""Say.. you're not by any chance French, are you?""

Er, no..

""We was just thinkin' that your ac-cent sounded kinda French.""

Um, no, old chap, certainly not. I'm British, ha-ha, what?
