true,rocknrollbreakfast,bs,Basel-Stadt,"As a very frequent DURO driver (I've just completed my army-time), I would strongly advise against that. The principle idea of the car is very good - it was supposed to be very sturdy, the back part was supposed to be easily exchangeable, the gearbox is very versatile and fit for almost anything.

In reality, things are a bit different: first of all, as already said, the engine is just terrible. It looses motor oil like crazy, the cooling water circuit breaks often (although you can drive quite a while with no cooling water :-)). And the mileage... oh god the mileage. It's a 150 HP engine (which is just not enough of an almost 5-ton-vehicle) and it uses more gasoline than a 500HP sportscar. I used to drive up and down the simplon road quite a lot (sure, that's not normal usage, but still) and easily used 30-40l of diesel per 100km (and that's on an empty car). Even on a straight highway, you'll easily break 15-20l.

It's also quite unreliable. I've had, in my 260 days of army, 5 DUROs that broke down and could not be fixed on the road.

They are loud. Logically, since you sit on top of the engine and the tiny window in your back doesn't hold back much noise. 

Ok, enough rant... If you plan to drive through africa, you need something very reliable, like a [Toyota Hilux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Hilux#Reputation), which seems to be indestructible. 

I don't know about the newer models of the DURO (the 6-wheeled, armored ones look incredibly [badass](http://i.imgur.com/u5USS.jpg)), but I would still be very careful. 

Also, I think they are expensive, If I remember it right they are listed with 90K CHF (new).",0,1358096655,null,0,false,0,c7w6gud,t3_16g61d,t1_c7w6gud,t1_c7vrxzz,null,1430947220,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

I'm not sure if it's a good idea to look for ex-army-vehicles. They are usually not treated very nicely (at least in CH), and I guess they're faded out when they don't meet the standards anymore.
