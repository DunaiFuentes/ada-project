However: the constitution does not forbid extraditing Swiss nationals. It forbids extraditing them without their consent.

The treaty specifies that the state can not refuse to extradite somebody merely because they are Swiss. But can it still refuse to extradite them because they do not consent to extradition?

* Seealpsee / Ebenalp in Canton Appenzell. Very beautiful!
* Walenpfad (Engelberg)
* Creux du Van
* 5 Lake hike at Pizol mountain
* also a nice 5 lake hike in Engelberg
* more like a stroll than a real hike (but especially nice in not-so-great weather): the surroundings of Etang de la Gruère in Jura

Note: nothing on this list is ""off the beaten"" track, most of these suggestions are pretty classy, popular hikes. But I think they introduce you well to Switzerland.
