true,dareos,null,null,"Wow, I was under the impression that this basic income proposal will file a law that forces companies to pay at least that fixed amount of money as salaries to their employees and not less. But getting money simply because I live, I will take that! I would quit my job, play gta5 all day and get my money from the government instead of my employer. Why did I go through two master degrees again? And abolishing all social welfare programs... Sounds like a good plan! As of now, retired people get a very basic AHV every month. With that system they could live like kings. 

But well, I'm only Swiss, Fox is clearly closer to the action and must therefore be better informed!

C'mon people... This is Switzerland, not France... Our wellfare is good, but not crazy!

How could this system even be financed? Sure we could save some bucks by shutting down the welfare programs, but some of them will still be needed! So, only viable solution would be to increase taxes, right? So, me making 6k per month with a tax rate of 25%, I'd get about 4.5k income for me to pay for housing and all the rest. But I habe to work my 42 hours every week. Now, this system comes along and the basic incoming is around 4k. If the taxes don't increase, I'd get 500 bucks more for working 42 hours more then anyone else.

This system that Fox drew a picture on is highly flawed. Lucky the real proposal is something different. Yet, I'm still against it!",0,1384645692,null,0,false,0,cdfzf7v,t3_1qrkdc,t1_cdfzf7v,t3_1qrkdc,null,1428631494,-1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,-1
