true,[deleted],null,null,"You could perhaps be right.  Of course, I'm only speaking from a ""bird's eye view"" currently away from the country, so my characterizations may be off the mark.

I guess the biggest difference in Swiss vs. US politics in my mind is that although the SVP is the biggest party, it is only because they are the really truly right-wing party that isn't relegated to the fringe.  The total right wing vote in CH is less than 27% -- they are surrounded by all the other left and center parties.  The right in CH is unified, and the left is splintered into many factions.  And it shows.  Things like euthanasia clinics and legalized brothels are *not* even up for discussion in the US.  The US is 50 years behind the progressive thinking of mainstream Swiss political parties, of course excepting the SVP.

Compare that to the US, where 47%! of the people voted for Romney, even though a truly loathsome candidate.  The true percentage of people with conservative views here exceeds 50% -- according to the latest Gallup poll, 42% Americans even view their official political orientation as ""deeply"" conservative.

I guess the point I'm making is that although you're right - the SVP does have many things in common with Republicans, they are much more marginalized in CH where there isn't a ""winner takes all"" system like here in the US.

If you're more interested in games like Starcraft, I don't think you'll have troubles finding someone to compete in a match (through ingame channels e.g.). For more team-oriented games, I'd suggest you'll start asking around through whatever means you can find (steam groups, gaming forums, reddit etc.) in your neighbourhood / canton, attend the occasional lans. Focus on students, since they are (I think) one of the bigger groups having gaming as a hobby. The gaming community is there of course but it's shy and quiet. That's why you can't rely on a well-organized portal, which introduces you to every other gamer in Switzerland.

Unter die Gebühren- und Meldepflicht für den Empfang von Radio- oder Fernsehprogrammen fallen:

a.
    Geräte, die zum Programmempfang bestimmt sind oder ausschliesslich zum Empfang bestimmte Bestandteile enthalten;
b.
    multifunktionale Geräte, falls sie hinsichtlich Vielfalt des empfangbaren Programmangebots und Empfangsqualität den Geräten nach Buchstabe a gleichwertig sind.
