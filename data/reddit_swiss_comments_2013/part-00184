true,P1r4nha,zh,Zürich,"At the moment we have too many men going to the army, so if less will go, we can cope with it. Then numbers show that in some cantons there are more people going to the military than others. That's clearly because they want to, not that they're too stupid to avoid it or that the other cantons only have sick men. The freedom to go or not to go is also almost a reality already.

Also you fail to argue the issue here. Let's compare it with taxes and our social security system. Almost nobody on the right would say we shouldn't help poor or sick people in distress, yet many are against having to force everybody to chip into a government run system. Many right wingers do voluntary charity work *additionally* to the taxes they already pay.

Likewise a 'no' to the military draft doesn't mean that there shouldn't be an army or that Switzerland doesn't need protection. It just means that men shouldn't be forced to go to the military.

The comparison with the second world war is not really good. Hitler never avoided Switzerland because he was afraid of us. Come on, he took on several big European countries at the same time and even went after the Russians. Granted he failed at that last one, but Switzerland would have been peanuts, with or without army.

Now it's likely that an army without military draft will be smaller, more efficient and more flexible.

Also we would have better gender equality and it would support the Swiss economy. Those are problems we are facing right now. It's reality and not a what-if scenario.

In conclusion I fail to see how you can't be *for* it. It's a wet dream for the left *and* the right.
