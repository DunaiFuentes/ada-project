Also, she said:

and:

&gt;that evening

So, she called emergency response places, called in French ""permanence"", because she though it was an emergency and she had an appointment the same evening.
To be clear, she didn't take and appointment by normal slow doctors, she went for an urgent problem, ok?


&gt;Nobody here is criticising the decision of the doctor as such, but the way she interacted with the patient

I would like to hear also the story told by the other side. A ""disgusted face"" is very subjective. Also her message is not very coherent: first, she says

and few lines further

Yeah, this is not Canada, the system works completely differently. 

&gt;So I thought I was just going to a walk-in doctor.

So did you know that you wasn't going to a gynecologist, but a practitioner? or in Canada do you have walk-in gynecologists? We don't have them here. 
The practitioner, here (and also in my home country) usually doesn't examine your genitals, they are unable, they listen to the description of the problem and give you something to stop the problem if the description gives them a hint of what it is. (Once I had some symptoms, I described them to my doctor and he gave me a medicament and sent me to the gynecologist in the hospital, I got the appointment a week later for a further and accurate check; in the meantime the medicament given by the doctor has solved the problem.)
That's why, I suppose, in the beginning the doctor didn't want to visit you; then, always I suppose, it started a series of misunderstandings between you and the doctor due to high cultural difference. But, I think, her intentions were good and, at the end, she was shocked just like you or even more.

Concerning the 200CHF bill: that's cheap in Geneva, also without STD check. In other parts of Switzerland it can be a little less expensive, but not much. As I've mentioned in one of my comments, health care in Switzerland is expensive and we absolutely can't afford to make it still more expensive for satisfying a minority of people who wants separate sets of doctors and nurses.
