true,dunderburg,null,null,"I was in the same situation as you. There is no law preventing you from opening a bank account in Switzerland. But the Swiss banks are extremely reluctant to let you open an account if they know you live in the US. So here is my advice...

* Stay away from the large banks like UBS, etc. I think you will be better off with a KB (I would also avoid Zürich KB) or the PostBank.
* Walk in with your Swiss passport and don't tell that you don't live in Switzerland. Use the address of a relative for the documents. If they ask why you don't have your own address just tell them you travel a lot for work. I doubt they will ask you since you just turned 18, but they did ask me since I am 30 and used my mom's address :)
* Getting a credit card may also be tricky since they generally want to know how much income/employment status. Since you are still young you may be able to get a guaranteed card with a deposit or something. 

On the US side it is pretty straight forward. If you have a foreign accounts with a balance over $50,000 you need to declare it under FACTA using IRS form 8938 (see here: http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Corporations/Foreign-Account-Tax-Compliance-Act-(FATCA)). I wouldn't recommend skipping this part since the penalties are pretty severe.

EDIT: You also need to file FinCEN form 114 if your total foreign assets are over $10,000.
