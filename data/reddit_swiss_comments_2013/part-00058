true,lakmaran,zh,Zürich,"As long as you don't live in Switzerland you don't have to do any service.

If you want to do service anyways, you have to talk to the swiss embassy in Canada.

There is no accomodation for english speaking recruits, even though there might be enough english speaking people in the army. Used languages are German, French and Italian in their respective regions.

You can wish for some specific jobs, but it's not guaranteed that you'll get what you wish for.

You could do the whole service in one piece which takes at least 10 months. Could be more if you want to be anything more than a private.
