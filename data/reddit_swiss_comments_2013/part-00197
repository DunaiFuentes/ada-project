true,botulizard,bs,Basel-Stadt,"I'm an American, and I visited Switzerland and got to experience the healthcare system in a way. Story time:

In spring 2010 I was an exchange student at Gymnasium Leonhard in Basel. The house I was staying in had two cats in it. I'm very allergic to cats. I knew I was allergic, but not *this* allergic. A few days in, I realized that I couldn't breathe in the house. I needed an inhaler, but mine had run out. I figured ""ok it's a long shot, but maybe if I go to the pharmacy, they'll sell me one because it's an emergency"".

I run around looking for a pharmacy, and finally find one after learning that a ""drugstore"" is something very different from a pharmacy and doesn't carry medication. I try to explain my problem to the pharmacist in broken German, and that didn't work. Then I tried making an inhaler shape with my thumb and finger, holding it up to my mouth and breathing in and saying ""to breathe"" in english, hoping she'd understand, because I felt like I was dying and I needed relief. Thankfully she understood and told me that she spoke English. I told her my situation, that I was a foreigner staying in a house with cats and that I could not breathe. I had no prescription and no Swiss insurance, but I needed an inhaler badly.

She told me she could help me. All I needed to do was write my doctor's name in a notebook that she then handed to me across the counter. I did that and she went back to get an inhaler. My relief was short-lived, as it turned to worry when I remembered that this would cost money. Being used to American drug prices, even with insurance, I braced for the worst. I needed to breathe though, so all in all the cost didn't matter, I told myself. I was ready to pay over 100 CHF if I had to. I'd never been so desperate. 

The pharmacist came back with the inhaler and a receipt for me to sign. I looked at the bottom line, holding my breath (figuratively of course, as any air I could get at the time was precious). Imagine my joy and relief at seeing that I was only being charged 14 CHF! (The Dollar and Franc were at par at the time, and maybe they still are. I don't know) I thanked the pharmacist as if she'd just saved my life because she kind of had, and I left in disbelief of the price I'd just paid as an un-insured, non-citizen. 

At home, the same inhaler costs me $30, and that's with insurance. For the price of my one American inhaler, I could buy two Swiss inhalers and have 2 CHF left over.

You have understand the Switzerland is a stupidly expensive country to live in. Real estate is off the wall (Manhattan-like prices everywhere), food is insane, and fuel is crazy. As examples, my two-bed apartment in Aargau (the sticks) was just under 2000 USD/month, meat is 30-50 USD/kg, and diesel is roughly 5 USD/gal. 

With that in mind, medications are vastly cheaper, and medical care is cheaper. My wife gets 3 months of birth control pills for less than our co-pay for one month in the US. I had laser surgery on some moles for 200CHF, including all medication and ointments. A co-worker spent a week in the hospital for a leg injury at about 3k, roughly a tenth of it out of pocket. When I spent a week in a hospital in the states, it was 30k. (And insurance covered 26)

Insurance costs roughly 200/mo here. Everyone has to buy it, and has to buy their own. Employers do not figure in, except for accident coverage.

Really? I don't know, but it seems Swiss system is much more simple.

For example, companies with 50+ employees don't have to pay insurance for them (this is what they are voting now in US). Health insurance is personal, employers are not involved. 


Also, there is no medicaid, medicare, just state refunds of insurance fees: i.e. you pay the insurance, then fill in the forms and next year have all or part of money back.

edit: Also, in CH there is a mandatory set of services and drugs that are covered (Lamal). You don't need to discuss with your doctor which is covered and which is not. This set is large enough so you only need extra insurances for foreign travel, or more comfort. Dental care is also not included in Lamal but you can have dental insurance for extra CHF 15/month.

Also I might add the the US is currently spending more money on health care than several single payer countries combined.. per capita.
