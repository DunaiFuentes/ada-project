* Zürich

* Argovia

""nämänä"" is rarely used nowadays, and I really don't remember where it is still common. I googeled it, but the only results were Azerbaijani. 

If we eliminate the regions I mentioned above it boils down to the region around Solothurn, which would make sense since Swatch is located in Grenchen. Perhaps my guess is biased because of that.
