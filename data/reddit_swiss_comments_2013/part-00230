true,GoEKniGhtofNi,lu,Luzern,"I did my army time in Fribourg. Before that I didn't know much about it but I became to love that town.

Go to an Ice Hockey Game of the local club [""HC Fribourg Gottéron""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HC_Fribourg-Gott%C3%A9ron). They play in the highest hockey league of Switzerland and have great fans. Everyone in Fribourg talks about the games and knows the players.  [Website in French](http://www.gotteron.ch/accueil.html)

Enjoy the old town and go have a cider at the [Brasserie Belvedere](https://plus.google.com/106917227160595762894/about?rfmt=s&amp;hl=en). Gives you the nicest view over the Gottéron valley.

Have a fondue in the [""café du midi""] (http://www.lemidi.ch/). Call them up to book a table, since it is quite popular. 

Fribourg is a university town, with lods of young people. It is also bilingual (French / German). 

You should also visit Bern, and Luzern by train. There is a driect train line from Fribourg to Bern / Luzern. 

Enjoy your stay there and ""I'ci c'est Fribourg!"" (chant they use for the hockey match)

The old city is absolutely magical, and like someone already mentioned, go to the Belvedere for an excellent view. The cathedral is very nice too, it's a [open-top](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fribourg_Cathedral) construction, so you can climb to the top and enjoy the view.

true,theamazingdesigner,fr,Fribourg,"You shouldn't have a hard time socializing if you are in the university, plenty of parties.

If you want to hang around expats, there is an irish pub in the ""Grand-Places"", they serve decent beer there. The nightlife in general is not too exciting in Fribourg, but they have pretty good concerts in [Fri-Son](http://www.fri-son.ch/). One place I like to hang out too is the ""[Ancienne Gare](http://www.cafeanciennegare.ch/index.php)"".

If you want a glimpse of local culture, don't miss the Carnaval. Parties in the old town's caves. Think of it as a Halloween where people get more drunk. The cathedral and many of the churches are worth a visit, don't forget to take a walk to the ""[Caves de la Madeleine](http://www.fribourgregion.ch/en/madeleine_hermitage.html)"".

In the countryside, you should check out Gruyère ([castle](http://www.chateau-gruyeres.ch/), [Giger Museum](http://www.hrgigermuseum.com/)), Charmey ([hot bath](http://www.bainsdelagruyere.ch/), hiking, ski), Schwarzsee (ice lake, ski), Estavayer-le-Lac (beach in summer), Morat (awesome [cream cakes](http://www.murtentourismus.ch/fr/vully-pie-murten.html)), Avenches ([capital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenches) of Switzerland in the Roman era, go to the [rock festival](http://2013.rockozarenes.com/en/welcome#.UnLGaScwe0Q) in the Roman arena it's worth it),...

The downsides of living in Fribourg: shitty weather, it's a small town, people will remember you if you pass out drunk in the street, the local beer sucks, the nightlife is quite bad, you have to pay taxes (but I've heard it's the case elsewhere too).

The upsides of living in Fribourg: it's a city with a catholic cultural background, so people are friendlier here ([proof](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=266_1193536860) that catholics are friendlier than protestants), there is still a majority of french-speaking people, you won't hear too much Swiss-German (and we are also friendlier than them), it's easy to get out of Fribourg and go to bigger cities,...
