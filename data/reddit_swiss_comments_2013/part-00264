I don't see why. If he doesn't plan on using his accounts to do anything borderline illegal in the US, a Credit Suisse or UBS account is the best thing you can get if you plan on using it outside of Switzerland. Have fun trying to deposit/withdraw money with your KB cards overseas. 

&gt;Getting a credit card may also be tricky since they generally want to know how much income/employment status. Since you are still young you may be able to get a guaranteed card with a deposit or something.

Prepaid credit card could be the solution here. You can get one for free as soon as you have an account (UBS/CS), without any questions asked. Sure, you can't get below 0, but otherwise you can use it just like a regular credit card (online, in shops, whatever).

Btw, what you're saying in your comment above isn't at all flattering for Swiss people.

Concerning business, for it it's better to learn some language spoken by several millions/billions of people and not by a few. So, following that way of thinking, it's better to learn some Chinese, English, Russian, etc.

If you live in Zurich and proximity, otherwise it's French, Italian or even Romanish, you know... 

And actually, what we're speaking here is that a lot of Swiss German speaking people prefer to switch to English instead to help the other to learn their language; so, yes, they know English. 
Finally,  as life is short and there is a lot one can do and learn, if I someone ask me an advise, I suggest to not waste time with Swiss German. Personally, I've learned some Romanish and some Russian, improved French and English. Romanish is pretty useless for business, but you know, there is not only business in life.
