No. That's not true. There is no law like that in Switzerland and no such cases. Try to prove I'm wrong.

The website can be prosecuted if it refuses to remove the comment or if it refuses to collaborate with the police, that's all. When someone posted a libel comment about someone else on Facebook, it was the author of the comment who was fined, not facebook.

Btw, Le Matin and Tages Anzeiger deletes critical comments that are not libel at all.

Seems to me you're answering your own question? You think anyone got time or money for that?



Also, yeah, it's possible that comments are heavily moderated (I don't know for the example you mention). So what? It's a news site, not reddit, not a US free speech advocacy place. They might have certain standards, and enforce them, and it's their right to do so.",0,1388071407,null,0,false,0,ceahmfb,t3_1tly6g,t1_ceahmfb,t1_ceaeka1,null,1427980798,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

&gt; You think anyone got time or money for that?

It's also easier and cheaper to moderate few comments later, only if someone complains, than moderate them all. And those sites have no that much comments.

So, I repeat my point: there is no practical or legal need for pre-moderation in Switzerland (except for spam, but I don't remember any spam on Tamedia websites). 

Of course, they are a private company and not obliged to please anyone but their investors. And they are not ""US free speech advocacy place"". They also could remove all comments, like soon-to-be-closed ""Le Temps"" did, that would be ok too. Opinion articles only. But leaving only those comments that agree with you, it's simulated popular support, like Pravda. This is PR and propaganda, not journalism and not free speech.

Also Tamedia has quasi monopoly in Switzerland, at least in french speaking part.  Mr. Pascal Couchepin found that it's ""practical"", I think it sucks.
