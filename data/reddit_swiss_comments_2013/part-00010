Just some quick estimates:
Sandwich, snack and a drink from a Migros or Coop would set you back around 10-15 CHF, for 15 CHF you can probably get quite a good quality quick lunch at a Migros or Coop restaurant, too. Dinner at a sit-down restaurant, think drink and a meal probably 25 CHF at the least. Dinner at a fast-food place or takeaway 15-20 CHF.

The winter tires aren't actually mandatory, a work colleague told me this. They are necessary to keep you covered with insurance though should anything happen - so to be on the safe side, it wouldn't hurt to have these fitted. 

Apart from that driving on the continent is actually a pleasurable experience compared to some news reports/opinions. French motorways are top notch but heavily tolled. Swiss roads are very well maintained also - i.e. good surface, speed, congestion and signage.
