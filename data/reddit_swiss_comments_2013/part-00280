I believe newspapers like Tagi have an agenda, political, commercial or others, so they censor critical comments and leave those who agree with them. And if you dare to disagree somewhere else, like on your blog, [then you risk this](http://www.bedeutungslos.ch/tags/natascha-knecht/). I know of other examples like this one.

As we're speaking about a guy from Russia, Russian online publications usually are not deleting anything except hate speech. So you can say Chodorkowski is a killer, Putin is a dictator, Ueli Maurer is an idiot, nothing happens. Probably the fact that they have many different publishers and not just a couple like here helps too.
