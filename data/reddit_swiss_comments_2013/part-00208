true,Zuerill,sg,St. Gallen,"As a student I think this initiative to be complete bullshit. Bit of a wall of text, but let me explain.

I am working a bit on the side, which results in about 8000.- CHF a year. I still live with my parents rent-free (that includes meals at home, electricity, internet, water etc.). They even pay for semester fees; the cost of transport is split by my parents and I. My payment goes to everything else, clothes, eating out (also in the mensa), going out on weekends, shopping etc. The money I currently earn is just about enough to cover my expenses. That way, my studies are basically paid by my parents, and if I want any luxury I have to work for it.

Now with this initiative, I'd get 2500.- CHF every month. I'd of course never have picked up a job. Since I plan on studying 4 and a half years total since turning 18, I'd get roughly 135000.- CHF. Deducting 8000.- CHF every year, I'd have 99'000.- CHF left on my bank account. Of course, my parents then wouldn't want to pay for anything. Transportation, semester fees and rent would result in probably about 5000.- CHF a year. 76500.- CHF left, and then University-degree paygrade. For not working aside my studies.

How in the hell is that fair to people who come out of their apprenticeship at 18? Even worse, they'd have to start funding *me* through my studies because they earn money (I mean, these 2500.- CHF would have to come from somewhere, no?).
