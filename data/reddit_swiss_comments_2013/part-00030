true,rayo2nd,tg,Thurgau,"I would pick the education system. I've talked to a guy from us and i was so surprised that if you don't go to university, you just get a job and get a few month of training. My first thought was: how can you do a job properly without any serious training. And when i told him that you have to do 3 or 4 years training with school (the apprenticeship) he couldn't believe it.

I'll try to find a graph of what paths you can do here at home

*edit* thanks raskalnikow for the link, the text is also available in english [Wiki in english](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Switzerland)

&gt; But traditionally an apprenticeship is highly valued

as far as i remember, there was a shift towards uni, also a discussion if they want to keep the apprenticeship. I truly hope they will keep it and maybe do something that it's more valued again. I mean doing an apprenticeship still gives you the opportunity to do higher education (i did an apprenticeship with ""Berufsmatura"", then went to a university of applied science (Fachhochschule), did a bachelor of applied science and switched then to university to do a master of science). 

I think university alone isn't a good education for doing a job, way too less pratice. An apprenticeship is a good foundation, you know how to work and still have theoretical background. If you want to do more, you're free to go.

Oh one more difference to the US: we don't have to pay a fortune to go to university, no matter which one. The state pays the most of it. They all cost a simillar amount.
