true,fancy_slap,null,null,"The best way to save money is still to drink before you go out or get a drink outside from a store. You will see that lots of people do this and it is not considered a thing only poor people do.

If you just go to a bar the prices don't vary too much. However if you want to go to a club you usually have to pay more for a drink.

The good thing about going out in St.Gallen is that you can reach everything by foot. So you can easily just walk to the next bar if you don't like the current one.

* If you like more rock music [Birreria](http://www.birreria.ch/) is a nice place to go.
* There is also a street which is called ""Bermudadreieck"" (Bermuda Triangle) where there are some cool bars. Just ask the locals. They know the place. It is not a official name so don't try to find it on a map.

I don't think that you should avoid any bar because it isn't really dangerous in St.Gallen. If it's too expensive just walk out.

I hope this helps.",0,1359445344,null,0,false,0,c85is5w,t3_17h2yg,t1_c85is5w,t3_17h2yg,null,1431116249,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

We have a students bar in campus (ad hoc) and on wednesdays a bigger one in town (meeting point) where you'll probably find the best prices... They even have rock paper scissors specials against the barkeeper where you can get the drink for free if you're lucky.

Also, i hope you signed up for the buddy prog. Your buddy will be able to give you some starting tips and after a few weeks, the exchangers ususally know more about St. Gallens Nightlife than us local students.

true,Xyrqurqualym,null,null,"Here we go, I know the SG-Area fairly well as I've lived there for a number of years. So here's the basic moneysaving guide for the Eastern Part of Switzerland. I'll add handy pronounciation guides wherever necessary. This comes in handy when on public transport or when you have to ask for directions.

However, if you're looking for specific bars, let me know what sort of music and drinks you like. Also, if you want to dance. Because there's something for everyone and I could give better advice if I knew what you're into. But I'll give you some general advice for surviving in SG for cheap.

**General Survival Tips**

* Never insult the local football team. They're the FC St. Gallen (aka. the FCSG, pronounced ""Eff-Tseh Ess-Geh""), and they're the best. If they lose every game, they're still the best.
* If you eat a Bratwurst, do not under any circumstance ask for ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise. This is social suicide. If you want to try a Bratwurst with any of those things, do it outside of SG.
* Learn how to pronounce names and places. This will make life a lot easier and even if you're a foreigner, you'll be better-received by the locals since you're making an effort.
* If people greet you on the street, greet them back. The most common greeting among strangers (I assume you have heard of the ""Polite You"", yes?) is Grüezi (""Grew-eh-tsi""). Among friends, it is Hoi (""Hoy"", occasionally more like a ""Ho-eh""). Learn to pull off these greetings as flawlessly as humanly possible.
* Most people have at least a very basic understanding of English. If you talk slowly and don't mumble, you should get away with basic questions as long as you know how to pronounce the thing you're looking for. If you want, I can give you a handy guide on asking basic questions in German.

**Food and drink**

* Drink tap water or mineral water. Get the M-Budget Mineral water, which is really dirt cheap. It's 0.25 CHF per bottle. You won't get it for cheaper. Do not buy Evian or anything else resembling a brand.
* Generally, M-Budget (Migros) and Prix Garantie (Coop) are your friends. They're the low-budget food lines of the two major supermarket chains we have. The glorious thing: It is exactly the same stuff as the brand-stuff they sell. It's just packaged differently.
* Shop at Aldi. There are two on the outskirts of the city. Both are accessible by bus. Take either the #11-bus from the Marktplatz to Mörschwil (""Mehr-shweel"") and get off at Obere Waid (""Oh-bear-eh Wah-eed"") or the #7 Bus that goes to Abtwil (""Ahbt-Weel"") and get off at Moos (""Mohs"").
* Some bakeries give bread away for half price right before they close for the night. Trial and error is the key here.
* If you're after cheap food to prepare at home, you might want to check out the Asian Supermarket in the Heiligkreuz (""High-lig-Krewts""). Take the Number 3 Bus to the Stop Langgasse (""Lann-Gahss"") and while you're driving there, look out the left side of the bus. You are looking for a red sliding door that says ""Asiaway"" on it.
* Cook at home. Eating out is usually quite expensive.
* If you're eating out, there's a good Thai buffet just by the Cinema Storchen. There is no place in SG where you would get a decent Swiss meal at a decent price. At least not in the city centre or in any of the potentially touristy spots.
* You might want to look into getting a job.

**Transportation**

* Get yourself an Ostwind-ticket. That's a sort of global bus pass for certain areas. www.ostwind.ch
* If you intend to travel, invest in a thing called a Halbtax-Abo. It's valid on all the trains and buses in the entire country and it halves every price you pay. This way, you can get to Zurich for 25 instead of 50 CHF.
* Avoid taxi cabs like the plague. They are ridiculously expensive.
* Try not to use trains after 1am. They charge extra then, even if you have a Gleis 7.
* Do not rent or buy a car.

**Electronics**

* If you already have a TV and/or a radio, bad luck. If you have the option to either get one or not, don't. Everything is available online and you won't have to pay the mandatory broadcasing fee called Billag.
* Do not get a fixnet phone. Settle for a mobile phone. If you don't need one, settle for Skype.

**Nightlife**

* There is precious little in the way of nightlife. And what little there is usually shuts down at around midnight. Some places stay open until 3am, but that's more an exception than a rule.
* Avoid clubs you have to pay an entry fee for. Unless you're a hot female, there's no way to bullshit your way past the bouncers.
* Drink beer. Never pay more than ~6.50 for a Kübel (a big beer, pronounced something along the lines of ""Kew-bl"") and ~4.50 for a Stange (""Stahn-geh"").
* If there's a festival in town. Keep the plastic mug they give you and the chip you get with it. Return it to any outdoor bar you like and you get some money back.",0,1359447690,null,0,false,0,c85j5v3,t3_17h2yg,t1_c85j5v3,t3_17h2yg,null,1431116431,19,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,19

Guinness: There's two places that has the stuff on tap. The O-Five Pub at the Poststrasse (""Pohsht-shtrahss""). In that club, there is no dancing. Also, you will be considered to be old. Legally, the age of being allowed in is 18, but if you look into the crowd, you will notice that the age-average is way below that. They also have cider on tap. The music is obscenely loud and not especially awesome. But it's a nice place, one of the few where you can play darts in a non-smoking area and if the people there know you, you won't ever pay any entry.

Here are a few tipps:


Movies and games from amazon.de are often censored. Use .co.uk instead
There's no shipping fee if your over 20€ when ordering only the things above from .de
 
Amazon.co.uk is often cheaper than amazon.de
 

And for the most important part: Try to stay UNDER 62.- CHF ( books: 200.- CHF) total costs, to avoid the Swiss Posts outrageous import fees. 

When ordering from Amazon Marketplace, make sure the seller mentions international shipping.

Things I found Amazon especially useful/cheap: Expensive Science Text Books (I'm a student, so I need these. Often ~10-20 CHF cheaper on Amazon), Books in English, uncensored Films (our shops tend to offer only censored german versions)

Times changed with the advancement of the internet and the music and film industry clearly has to adapt to these new ways instead of insisting prosecution for unlawfully distribution of their property. 

Fortunately, in Switzerland it's still legal to download music for personal use. The Nationalrat (House of representative) recently figured out that the damage that is done by free downloaders to the music industry is marginally at most and repression would cost too much and unnecessary criminalize people. Common sense. Unfortunately it's not in the EU and overseas. And therefore I see the need for interest groups or parties that oppose ancient and repressive laws.

But, what I really dislike about the movement is, that they romanticize the term 'Pirate' like that's some noble cause or something. It's not. Pirates are lawless thieves. Criminals, often violent. Not more not less.
