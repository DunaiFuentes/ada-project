true,Vlip,be,Bern,"&gt;The party is in the centre of the city, not only do very few people actually live there

Actually that's is completely incorrect. The old town is mixed use and IIRC pretty much everything that is above the second floor has to be residential (ie flats). Most of the buildings have at least 4 floors, usually more so the old town is mainly used as a residential area so yes, there are quite a lot of people actually living there. Me being one of them so I should know ;). IIRC this was done because the old town was dead after business hours so the city changed that law to put back some life in it.

Honestly I don't mind TdF and the other occasional spontaneous outbursts of outrage that sometimes go under my windows. As you said, it's part of living in the center of the country's capital, you get to witness people bang on the drums of their pet political issue and it's perfectly fine (Please though, no need to break things, tag things and certainly a civilized man does not throw his garbage on the ground, thank you very much).

The only thing that irks me with the TdF this year is the complete and utter refusal to talk with the authorities. I get it, I get their pet peeve (not that I completely agree with it, but I get it, they are cute), I even get why they want to be anonymous. But nothing in that prevents them from giving the authorities an anonymous email address where the authorities can at least talk with them.

Certainly we are not arguing that expecting people to talk to each other is already being an oppressive regime intolerant of youthful exuberance?

No, instead we get the arrogance of a couple of anonymous persons who have the gal of pretending THEY get to decide what goes on in our streets without even talking to anyone.

If you are more of a nature person and want to have a real experience, I suggest hiking to the Rotstockhuette. Also see there website with hiking suggestions: http://www.rotstockhuette.ch/. A suggestion could be: visit Lauterbrunnen, in the afternoon hike to the hut (arrive around 5pm), sleep in the hut, the next day hike up the Schilthorn and take the cable cart down.",0,1369507627,null,0,false,0,ca5v493,t3_1ev0z5,t1_ca5v493,t1_ca4k4em,null,1431035497,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

If you want to go deeper into Switzerland, there's of course the obvious choices Zuerich and Bern, but Luzern is also really nice. If you want to travel a bit farther, you might check out the Ticino area, that's Lugano et al. If you only have two days I'd suggest not travelling farther west than Bern though.

true,Vlip,be,Bern,"As I live in the old town of Bern I took a walk along the TdF's path this morning and made a few pictures.


I used to find TdF a harmless and fun way the youth found to pump a bit of life in the sometime too reserved and introverted Swiss people but now I fear the event has been subverted by a minority of anarchist/communist vandals and thugs.


The motto was reclaiming THEIR streets which brings two things to my mind:

1: It's also MY streets, it's also the streets of the older generations, it's everyone's streets, not only YOURS, thank you very much

2: All they seem to be able to do when they ""reclaim"" the streets is destroy them. 
Really? Did the flower pots oppress them by being pretty? And why did the Embassy of Sweden deserve to be smashed and tagged? (Sorry Sweden, as if you didn't have already enough on your hands at home).

The Bernese old town is one of the prettiest town in Switzerland and I find abhorrent what those vandals did to some of those respectable, old, UNESCO protected buildings. It deserves to be protected and I think the police did what needed to be done, probably with more restraint than in any other town.


Now, to be fair, as usual, these are the acts of a tiny small minortiy. The ""Black block"" that walked in front of the masses who just came to have fun. 
From what I can gather the black block organised this event under the pretence of it being a harmless ""let's dance in the street"" event and one day before it started they started dumping their brainless anarcho-communist propaganda and tried to claim that the masses dancing behind them agreed with their bullshit.",0,1369557926,null,0,false,0,ca67nxi,t3_1f2obr,t1_ca67nxi,t3_1f2obr,null,1431029439,51,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,51
