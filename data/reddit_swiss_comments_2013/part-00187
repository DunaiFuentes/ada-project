You should look into the [Swiss Pass](http://www.swiss-pass.ch/) - You can buy a pass depending on how long you'll be there, but it gets you unlimited travel on the national rail/bus/ferry network as well as on the public transport within the cities. It's well worth the money as individual tickets add up quickly and renting a car just is NOT worth it. The Swiss public transit network pretty much covers every nook and cranny of the country.

- budget?

If you based in Speiz like /u/swiller suggested then you'd be in prime position to visit the Matterhorn (snow/mountain), Montreux (nice city, famous castle), Grindelwald (paragliding, waterfalls, hiking), Gruyere (cheese and Geiger Museum), Berne (important historic city)...

Interlaken and the lauterbrunnen valley are tremendous. And the Aareschlucht, if you are there in not-winter is really neat, and cheap, and close to reichenbach. 

Then you have Lucerne and Pilatus....

Okay, you get the idea.
