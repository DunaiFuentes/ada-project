While file sharing is how it started, the pirate parties are long ways past of it being their defining subject.

Furthermore, the term pirate was given filesharers by the marketing apparatus of the music and film industry; for exactly the reasons you described: they are violent robbers at sea who rape, plunder, kill and burn. Which is of course totally the same thing as downloading music.
In turn, the then evolving community that became the pirate parties and their sister movements, started to use the term themselves to humoristically counteract the goals of the marketing firms.

true,MyMotherWasAWitch,null,null,"Great choice! Zermatt is among my favorite places! 

If you have a whole day, you should check out the skiing region Klein Matterhorn (go up with the small gondolas on the south side of the village) and ski down into Italy, then come back. 

If you want to stay in Switzerland: 
What I like to do if I have time is going up to Klein Matterhorn:
1. check out the amazing view
2. see the ice cave
3. ski down the glacier
(Good restaurant: Gandegg-Hütte, you may have to make a reservation). 
Then go back up to Schwarzsee and ski down there to Furi, avoiding the mostly icy slope Furgg - Furi, and skiing through a more forest-y region. A good stop here is restaurant Furri on the terrace. From Furi you can take the new gondolas to Riffelberg and ski the fantastic slopes in the Gornergrat region. Be sure to go up to the top (Gornergrat - you might have to take the train). 
From that region you can also ski through to the Sunnegga region. Go from Riffelalp via Grünsee to Gant and take the Gondola to Blauherd. You can go up even further to Rothorn, have your picture taken with a St Bernard, and ski down. If you do this you *must* check out restaurant Fluhalp! Be careful though: after about 800m, instead of going back to Blauherd, take a left, there should be a big orange arrow.
From Fluhalp, the slope &amp; gondola go back to Blauherd and from there you can basically ski down to Zermatt. This way you cover all skiable regions. I suggested starting at Klein Matterhorn because of the sun. It will shine longest onto the Sunnegga region while the Klein Matterhorn region &amp; glacier are in the shadow after noon. 
(Personally I like to start at Sunnegga and do the opposite, as the place I normally stay is on the other side of the village)

For après-ski: favorites are Cervo (if you come down Sunnegga-side), a quite crowded but cool place, Hennustall (live music) if you ski Furi-Zermat, which is located about 300m before the slope ends (be careful to take the *slope*, not the road), and of course Papperla Pub down in the village (Steinmattstrasse) with live music as well. 

For dinner: depends on your taste, Zermatt has a lot to offer. One of my favorites is restaurant Rua Thai at Hotel Albana Real, the food is great and the ambience is really nice. If you feel like a pizza, go to the North Wall (Hotel Rhodania), choose your toppings and enjoy the cool skiing videos on the big screen. If you're very hungry, order the nachos (yum). The prices are completely reasonable for Zermatt. Other than that there are Japanese, Chinese, Swiss, French, Italian, English restaurants -- whatever your stomach may want! There is also a fusion food restaurant but i haven't been there yet... (THE PIPE, Hofmattstrasse) in the same street there are: the only movie theatre in town and cool club Vernissage (by local artist Heinz Julen) and a crêperie (if you go there, say hi to Kitti).

For going out I recommend The Brown Cow (Hotel Post) for just a few drinks, Papperla Pub, Vernissage, The Pink (live music). If you're more into the clubbing style you will be happy at Schneewittchen. If you want to get shit-faced with the locals and are not claustrophobic: Little Bar. 

Other things to do: toboggan from Furi to Zermatt (on the *road* this time), or from Riffelalp to Riffelberg (daytime only), winter hiking trails, or just walk around, it's stunning there whatever you do.
