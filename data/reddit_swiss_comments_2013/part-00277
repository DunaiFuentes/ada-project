Depends on your budget, inner city (1 minute from center) is more expensive. Near hardbrücke/technopark (12minute from center) is relatively cheap.. Since you're on reddit and actually asking for tips here instead of booking the baur au lac I assume you're looking for the most bang for buck. Ibis, Novotel, 25hours are all rather cheap. (in the 25hours: make sure to explicitly ask for a non-bunk bed room.. )",0,1387575121,null,0,false,0,ce6lymc,t3_1t9r8q,t1_ce6lymc,t3_1t9r8q,null,1428048980,0,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,0

true,angurvaki,null,null,"There's currently a Nigerian refugee in Swiss that was deported to Swiss under the Dublin regulation. 

The matter was extremely shady: the ministry of immigration leaked sensitive personal information to the press where he's accused of crimes without any plausible explanation, he's expecting a child with an another refugee that wasn't deported, who was harassed daily by the police after he went into hiding. He was deported overnight without his lawyer knowing, who couldn't deliver a care package of money and necessities to him (And apparently he was told he'd be charged for the flight and upkeep of the two policemen that escorted him to Switzerland).

Last we heard of him, he's without money or shelter squatting in a train station. 

This is all just from the top of my head from what I recall from the news, and I might be getting the facts wrong, but the whole situation is not at all humane and we can't really understand why it's so urgent to export someone that's been in the system for two years with such haste and subterfuge.

I'm sure you've cottoned on to several of the good aspects already (clean, lots of very pretty bits, stuff works, good public transport, low crime, etc.)  So I'll bring a few of the negative ones.  Note:  I'm Swiss, I like the country, but there are some things you should at least be aware of so you can do your own research.

- it's expensive.  Taxes are low, everything else is not.  Like ""whoa"".
- we can come off as cold, superficial, and anal retentive.  Note, ""can"".  
- it gets cold in winter.  Really cold.
- and grey.  
- many foreigners I know struggle with loneliness and feel highly unwelcome.  Others are as happy as a pig in shit.  YMMV.
- you may experience a decline in convenience in a lot of things (e.g. retail opening hours) depending on the country you're coming from.
- did I mention it's really expensive?
- there's a strong ""this is how it is, this is how it's done, deal"" mentality sometimes.  In some ways, Switzerland is really pragmatic and open, and in other ways it can be a bureaucratic (or just generally hidebound) nightmare.
- nice housing can be tough to find.
- it's not a very spontaneous country. 

Since you've spent time already, you'll have gotten at least a bit of a feel for the place (you really can't generalize with some things, as culture varies from city to city) so for the visa stuff, I'd contact the local consulate and flat-out ask.  That's one good thing - you can always call up some office or another and they're there to give you information.

If you have teaching credentials and experience, you can also check with some of the international schools - a quick search should turn up a great number of them.",0,1387664914,null,0,false,0,ce7b177,t3_1tf5oz,t1_ce7b177,t3_1tf5oz,null,1428037092,9,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,9
