For more, check out Sustenpass, Grimselpass, Furkapass, Gotthardpass, Nufenenpass, etc. on Google Maps.

I don't really know about the paperwork for a foreign person, normall you'll have to sign a contract and then provide the Strassenverkehrsamt (administration for vehicles in Switzerland) with an insurance proof, and then you'll get the number plate written over to you.

Forget about renting a bike, that would be way too expensive. Leasing could be difficult, I have never heard of someone leasing a bike here.

To be honest, its difficult to find a job in Switzerland without specific skills that can't be found locally.

I'm English and found my (IT) job on www.jobserve.com a few years ago. There is also www.jobs.ch.
