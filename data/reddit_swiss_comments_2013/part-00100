true,[deleted],null,null,"I feel like I touched a delicate issue here. Sorry I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. My choice of words were not good either. But English is not my mother tongue. So it was easier to use the word ""standardization"". 

But I did not mean it as a bad word. I know for sure that French had a complete and very harsh standardization process. IIRC the french we hear and read mostly today originated from some dialects in the Nord of France. The Nord imposed its language to the rest. 

I was talking about my experience. I wasn't talking about foreigners but real Swiss, many of whom can still retrace many of their ancestors in Switzerland. I've noticed that the grand-parents don't talk like the parents. And those don't talk like their children who are at my age. A few of my friends have children, who do not talk like their parents too. But what I noticed is the newer/younger they are the more they ressemble in their language use.

Those people are physician, scientists, a few cheese makers, farmers (I live in a Canton of farmers), pastors, teachers. I wouldn't say they are poor or uneducated or influenced by foreigners. Except maybe from me. But then I'm a rare bird to them.

I think it has something more to do with a wider access to Swiss-German in TV, radio, internet and a shift to a sense of a national identity at the expense of a regional identity. There is also a tendancy to a more economical and political centralization (think Bern, Zürich and Bâle where young people from different Cantons hang together) ",0,1369126289,null,0,false,0,ca2xcl6,t3_1dz3vl,t1_ca2xcl6,t1_ca2as0v,null,1431086342,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
