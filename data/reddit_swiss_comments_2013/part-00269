true,DantesDame,bs,Basel-Stadt,"I can see two main options: get a RailPass and hop around from place to place, or find somewhere central and stay close and just enjoy what is in the immediate area. Personally, I would go with the first option, as you'll be able to see so much more.

We had friends visit last summer and took some time to show them around. Check out [this page on my website](http://dantesdame.com/temp/2013-switzerland-by-rail/) to give you an idea of what there is to see and how easy (and quick) it is to get from place to place.

We did not book anything ahead of time and never had any problems finding a room (granted, this was June and not July - you might run into some booked places). But by not booking ahead you're free to either stay there because it is amazing (ie, Zermatt) and you want to explore more, or just get back on the next train because you don't like it at all (ie, Martigny).
