I would look into going to Lauterbrunnen. It's a really small village in a gorge. There are tons of places to go hiking here, and you can take a train to the top of the Jungfrau - it's really cool even if the weather is bad (bring sunglasses anyway!). 

The public transport system in Switzerland is the best in the world as far as I am concerned. It's expensive - but you can go almost anywhere. If you have any questions feel free to ask!
