true,Motzlord,tg,Thurgau,"Okay... First of all, there are several different kinds of huts. The most common kind would be summer huts that farmers use. They take their cattle (or sheep or whatever) up in spring and then they stay up there over summer and go back down in autumn. Obviously, the ""fields"" are not very useful for farming in winter when there's snow. (If their land is part of a ski resort, they will probably work at a ski lift or something like that in winter.)
The Next thing I can think of are mountain huts that work like a cheap hotel. They're usually situated quite far up on mountains and passes and offer shelter and food to hikers and climbers (you stay there over night so you can get an extra early start in the morning) Most of these are only open in summer. [Example](http://www.sac-altels.ch/huetten/fruendenhuette.php)

Private cabins might exist, but not in the locations you provided, they are usually accessible by car.
As for the names: The one in the green arrow is called ""Undri Rotlaui"", which I cannot correctly translate. ""Undri"" is ""Untere"" - ""lower"" in English, maybe there's another one higher up somewhere. ""Rot"" is red, maybe it has something to do with the forest around there (certain kinds of pines are called red pines in German and I think ""laui"" is a dialect word for mountain pasture which is just called ""Alp"" in Swiss German so it's pretty much a description of where it's situated. Obviously only useful if you're from around. The ones in the picture are definitely for farming.

As for the building: Definitely not. first of all, you'd have to own the land. A farmer who owns the land can probably build a new hut if he wants to. He'll probably have to go through a complicated bureaucratic process to make sure the new building doesn't violate any nature laws, is not in an avalanche zone and that no one has any major problems with it.


/Edit: There is in fact a ""Obri Rotlaui"", so the names are to differentiate between the two. Still not sure about the ""red"" part, it's probably also some kind of messed up local geographical designation.
/Edit2: Also, keep in mind that Switzerland is still pretty damn small. Middle of nowhere yes, but still accessible by foot within 1-2h from the nearest road.
/Edit3: There's another kind, the one in the middle of mountain slopes for climbers if they are suddenly suprised by weather and can't make it down. They provide shelter to survive the night.

Another Edit: I think most mountain huts are passed down through generations, as at least one kid usually takes over the parent's farm, thus also needing the hut to keep the business going up there. Some of them are actually pretty old and date back like 200 years.


**TL;DR** Almost all of the huts are for farming, essentially a summer home for farmers because their land up there is only useful in summer.",0,1364884471,null,0,1364894015,0,c96twu3,t3_1bhzcy,t1_c96twu3,t3_1bhzcy,null,1431702328,21,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,21

I don't know who told you that but I'd go for a prepay... It's very simple and not that costy. For exemple if you go for the operator 'Orange' you can get 300MB/Month for CHF 10.- or 1GB/Month for CHF 20.-!

What I was trying to say is that Swiss Buildings are notoriously well-done.
