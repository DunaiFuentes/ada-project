Imagine if you grew up and were aware of both tomatoes and potatoes, but have never met either in a supermarket.  You associate them together because they have vaguely similar sounds and you know they both originated in the Americas.  If you were taking a written exam, you could definitely identify each one correctly.  However, they sound vaguely similar and you've never needed to distinguish one from the other, so you've never developed the habit of being careful to select the right one in conversation.

For something a bit further away I always like to recommed Candria. It's a small medieval town on Lake Lugano. There is pretty amazing food, and if you are into that sort of thing there is a smugglers museum across the lake.

**Lauterbrunnen / Valley of 72 Waterfalls**: (http://bit.ly/12Ew52S). Just about one of the most beautyful places in Switzerland in my opinion. The valley was also the inspiration for Rivendell in Lord of The Rings.

**Jungfrau**: One of the tallest and most scenic mountains in Switzerland (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungfrau). You'll want check ticket pricing since the ride is only partially covered by the GA.

**Glacier Express** This is a must if you are into trains, but I think there will also be an additional fee for the tickets and you'll want to reserve ahead of time. (http://www.glacierexpress.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx)

**Bernina Express** Nice alternative to the Glacier Express, and generally easier to get reservations from what I know: (http://www.rhb.ch/Bernina-Express.1676.0.html?&amp;L=4)

**Lugano / Locarno / Melide** There is a lot of shopping and great food in Lugano. Highly recommend taking the 10 minute boat ride to Candria for a coffee of ice creme. And if you are into that sort of thing you may want to check out Swiss Miniature in Melide (http://www.myswitzerland.com/en/swissminiatur-melide.html)

There is also the **Technorama / Swiss Science Center** in Winterturn (http://www.technorama.ch/en/) and the **Verkershaus** in Luzern (http://www.verkehrshaus.ch/en/)

If you are into hiking and are looking for something close to you I'd recommend the **Kronberg to Schwägalp trail** (http://www.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?id=3521305). Pro tip: Don't reverse the route or you will be doing a lot of walking uphill :)

That's just off the top of my head. If you are looking for more specific ideas let me know :)
