true,CHGE,ge,Genève,"How different the different ""Cantons"" (roughly equivalent to states) are and how strangely not united we are (though this second part might just be my impression).

For example, in terms of differences, you could compare Geneve and Valais, Geneve is fairly progressive and Valais quite conservative. Religion in Valais is still fairly important for example. (a friend from over there told me baptism is actually done in school and there are obligatory religion lessons, this is second hand info though)

As for unity, the rostigraben is quite interesting, it's the gap between the French speaking part of Switzerland and the German speaking part.

1 Look in regions where you can actually find a job. You say you know German, so obviously target German area first.

2 You are taxed where you live. Living in Germany will have lower costs but taxes are higher. Also, a G permit (cross border) is not easy to come by. Honestly, don't even bother looking into this.

&gt;EU/EFTA nationals may enter Switzerland for job-searching purposes. No permit is required for stays of up to three months. If no job can be found within this time, the appropriate local or cantonal authorities will grant a short-term residence permit (type L permit) valid for another three months' job search.

&gt;Family members of EU/EFTA nationals are granted an EU/EFTA permit even if they are third-state nationals. They may take up gainful employment; however they have to inform the appropriate cantonal migration authorities before doing so. 

So in summary, you can come here to search for a job, and your wife can also work here.

0) Job first. Makes finding a flat easier too, because you know where to search for a flat and you can prove that you will have a sufficient income to pay the rent. Skype and co seem more probable if you're looking for an IT job than let's say working as cashier. If you have several interviews, schedule them during the same week and try a hotel.

1) Approx. 60% of Switzerland speaks german, 30% french and 10% italian. As you're both good in german, you may better start in Basel, Zürich, Luzern, Bern, etc first. Wiki will give you all the infos you need.

2) I recommend living where you work. Being polish, living in Germany and working in Switzerland seems like a big pain in the ass. You can still move out and across the boarder to a later point. 

3) No. The minimum though is usually 6-12months. As long as you pay your rent and don't cause much trouble, there's no reason why any owner would kick you out (other for let's say personal use, if you're renting only one piece of the owner's house). It's also impossible to get kicked out from one day to another, he would have to warn you several months before. For your second question, it depends on what kind of place you want to rent. If you're going for an apartment it's usually a real estate agency. This really doesn't matter though, you shouldn't worry about it. 

4) I have no clue. Try englishforum.ch or even better, go to your ''local'' swiss embassy. Make a call, take an appointment and I'm sure they will be able to help you out.
