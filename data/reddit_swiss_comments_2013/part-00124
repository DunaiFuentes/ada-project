And more in depth, but in German:
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drei-S%C3%A4ulen-System_(Schweiz)

Pillar 3 is divided into Pillar 3a and Pillar 3b. With Pillar 3a, you can freely pay money into a special pension fund of your choosing, most banks will consult you here. You can deduct the amount you paid into this fund from your taxes (up to a certain amount, usually around 6500 CHF a year if you already pay into a Pillar 2 pension fund, more if you are NOT part of a Pillar 2 pension fund, for instance if you are self-employed). Since it's tax deductible, there are certain limitations on how you can use the money in your Pillar 3a.

You can withdraw your money from Pillar 3a if you decide to leave Switzerland. 

In principal, within limits, these are the reasons to withdraw money from your 3a Pillar (from Wikipedia). I'm no lawyer and my English skills suck, so beware :)

* Finanzierung von selbstbewohntem Wohneigentum oder Rückzahlung von bestehenden Hypotheken - You can use it if you want to buy a house for yourself or pay back existing mortgages.

* Einkauf in eine Pensionskasse - If you want to buy into a pension fund (Pillar 2)

* Aufnahme einer selbständigen Erwerbstätigkeit oder Wechsel der bisherigen selbständigen Erwerbstätigkeit - If you decide to become self-employed.

* Verlassen der Schweiz (Auswanderung) - If you want to leave Switzerland

* Bezug einer Invalidenrente und das Invaliditätsrisiko ist nicht mit einer Zusatzversicherung abgesichert - If you receive IV (disability insurance) and your risk was was covered by a additional insurance

Yes &amp; no. The employer has to pay for accident insurance on the job (for every job. no matter how many hours per week.). If you work more than 8 hours, that same insurance also insures you against accidents **while not working**. These additional costs are to be paid by you (Though there are employers who simply pay that as well).

Edit: Here are all deductions (All percent numbers rule of thumb):

* AHV/IV/EO (Pillar I): Usually 5% 
* ALV: 1% (Insurance against going out of work)
* Unfallversicherung: 2% or so (The accident insurance as I wrote above)
* Pensionskasse (Pillar II): A few percent, half paid by you, half by the employer. Differs greatly from place to place, age, etc.
* Kranktaggeld: Peanuts. (Insurance against getting sick)
* Pillar III: Can be paid by you if you wish to.

Here are some surprising things I noticed while there,

-ketchup is not a free condiment at say, a McDonalds or COOP Restaurant. You pay for it.

-A big mac costs over $13 American dollars, not that you come here for...big macs. But it lets you gauge the cost of food. Raman noodles are $1.80 at the COOP, per package. In the states we are used to paying $2.50 a BigMac and 10 to 20 cents for a package of raman noodles.

-This also means that if you decide to eat out for lunch, you may pay $20 or more, and for dinner, $30 or more.

-You pay to use toilets at places like train stations. Not urinals, but toilets.

-Free refills on drinks are kind of unheard of, also no Pepsi products.

-Swiss beer is nothing to write home about, Italy really has some good things going on with beer though. Germany as well.

Don't see this as bitching, just to help you prepare for the costs really. I spent over $28 American for 10 wings, an order of fries, and a small drink with no refill. It just...is what it is. I was in awe over how things could just cost...so much here? It makes everything in the states seem dirt cheap.

The ""no refills"" thing is definitely true, but we do have Pepsi.

&gt; Swiss beer is nothing to write home about, Italy really has some good things going on with beer though. Germany as well.

You're doing us a bit of an injustice there, I think - Switzerland has a fairly respectable number of very good mini-/micro-breweries. In the Basel region, I can recommend ""Unser Bier"" or ""Ueli Bier"", both of which can be found in many varieties at many cornershops and larger supermarkets.

Additional tip: There is a shop called ""Drinks of the world"" at Basel's main railway station, which has a very good selection of imported beer from - you guessed it - all over the world.

Assuming that it's possible for you (since I'm not sure where you're from I don't know what the visa/travel document situation is like for you), it might be worthwhile giving those a try as well - for example, Freiburg in Germany is quite lovely for a daytrip, and can be reached quite easily from Basel by train. Lovely old town, and - yes - nice beer. Added benefit: You can expect things to be a bit more affordable than in Switzerland...

Then again, the rest of Switzerland is also just a railway journey away - it's a small country with excellent transport infrastructure, so essentially, you can get more or less anywhere within a few hours.

The Götheanum, I think it's in Dornach, is also pretty cool. They had a Tourmaline exhibit there when I went last.

In Zürich, the Museum für Gestalt is very interesting. It's the only place I went to twice when I was there for a month 7 years ago.

Nature is pretty easy to get. Just pick a direction and start walking, it's impossible not to run into it.

If you cook for yourself, food isn't that much more expensive. At least compared to Vancouver I found groceries to be cheaper (I buy ~70% organic), that may have contributed to the prices being roughly the same.

I'm in Basel and there is some really nice (non-Alpine) hiking within a 20 minute train ride of Basel.

France has the Volgas Mountains within a 30 minute drive with oodles of tiny villages seemingly dedicated to the art of wine making/tasting. And then of course there's Germany. A 1 (?) hour train ride will get you to the very historic and beautiful town of Freiburg.
