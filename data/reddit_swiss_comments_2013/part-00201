true,Pshan2121,world,Other,"You bring up a good choice about freedom and women's rights. I think women like the mother's and grandmother's you mention fought a battle, and rightly so, to ensure women have a choice and would be respected and supported for whatever they may do in life. Back in those days, the ""respectable"" choice was to be a stay at home wife, so support and encouraging respect of women was more focused in the professional arena because that is where the societal support was lacking. However, today I feel this has reversed. Now, it seems if you make the choice to stay at home, and make your husband and family's happiness your priority you are disrespected, labeled as backwards, and pressure by society to have some sort of career or ""independent life"". It is almost as if the same oppression exists, but is imparted on the exact opposite group. I think each and every women should make the choice that feels right in her heart, wither that is going the army, becoming a ceo, doing charity work, or working in the home. No one way is better than another, you have to do what feels authentic to yourself and your soul. To me I get joy, satisfaction, and a sense of accomplishment/self worth to see my husband happy, run a house smoothly and properly (which is a lot of work mind you), and to aid and support my husband in any way I can. Consequentially, he can come home to relaxation and calmness so he can better tackle the problems facing him in his day and in the world. Plus, I feel like these are where my talents really shine, it just flows easily. I can only assume these feelings will continue to grow when I have children. I think it is a perfectly respectable choice in life to focus on your families' happiness over a career. My husband respects me for it as well, it is not like he is some oppressive monster. I can't tell you the times my skills have helped him in his business too. Knowing what to say to who, how to guide a conversation, and the cultural taboos of many different cultures has helped many a dinner party, business dinner, or gift exchange go smoothly. Am I in a supporting role? Sure. However, playing a more supporting role is no reason to labeled me a relic of an age gone by. What would a team be without all types of players? I doubt it would function smoothly at all. To me, what is a nation but made up of people's husbands, wives, and children? By staying at home, and doing my part to give my husband and children the best upbringing and home life I can, I am empowering them to have a solid and stable ground, so my future son OR Daughter can go out into the world and accomplish her goals, regardless if that is being the first women president or a stay at home mom. I feel like if I can do all I can, god willing, to ensure my children have a rich, stable, and healthy upbringing so they can become responsible and caring members of society, then I am doing my part to make the world a better place.

I didn't wanted to contest your choice of the school, but your way to present yourself as a wife. Before to be the wife of someone, you're a person with your own dignity and personality. That's my point and the point of all past women battles. It's not that a woman or a man (I don't understand why men shouldn't) should no more learn the etiquette and the protocol, if they want to (I personally don't), but about to have respect of yourself as a human being not someone property or servant or support role. I know a lot of women who did the choice of staying home and taking care of children or work only part time, I know also some men who did the same and take care of family and children, but each of these people did this not to obey to the desire of their partner, but to their own desires and necessity. None of these women  would accept to not speak to other men than their husband, get a tattoo, they don't want, to obey their husband, do a certain school to be a better wife as you mention in this post or in the other post cited above.

I sometimes struggle with the same thing, but in regards to western culture. For example, when I see a girl dress very revealingly or be sexually adventurous to me I feel bad for the girl, feel like she has no self-respect. I always want to say to her ""have more character"". However, then I take a step back and realize to her these actions do not carry the same connotation or meaning of self- disrespect or lack of character to her as it does to me. She was raised in an entirely different cultural context. Just as different hand gestures can have different, and at times opposite, meanings based on country and culture, so too can these behaviors we are discussing. While, you might think the way I act and the relationship with my husband might denote oppression and lack of respect I don't feel the same way. Just as when you look at a flirty girl in a short skirt, you don't feel like she is lacking in character, where if I forget to suspend my judgment, I might.

But does he not talk to other women and does he listen to what you say? 

&gt;For example, when I see a girl dress very revealingly or be sexually adventurous to me I feel bad for the girl, feel like she has no self-respect.

Well, for me, if someone obliges her to dress in a certain way against her will, she has no respect of herself, but if nobody or any traditions or similar obliges her, then she has respect of herself, IMO. Also, for  western people the dress is not always related to wanting to reveal something or be sexually attractive for someone. For example, I dress almost all the summer with short pants and this isn't to be sexually attractive to someone, but because it's very hot and I feel more comfortable and free in the movement that way; moreover my body absorbs the vitamin D thanks to the sun after long winter months. In the same way, in winter I dress completely differently covering my head (and if it's really cold, even leaving only the eyes free) not for modesty or to avoid to be sexually attractive , but because it's more appropriate to the season. 

&gt;I think it is hard, but we have to try to place ourselves in the other person's life and situation before we can make a judgment. In general, I think judgment is best left up to God. 

For me it's a little different. As long as people don't violate the law, it's ok. But, if someone tries to force someone else against their will, then I think we should oppose it.

No, it's not. Social pressure is not a law. You are free to work or to stay at home, if you stay at home the law and the state will not punish you. But in the past (and in some countries and cultures in the present) you had no choice, you was obliged by law, religion and state to stay at home. It's exactly what those grand-mothers fought.

true,Pshan2121,world,Other,"Just to be clear, you are saying the only type of oppression or restriction is if there is a law preventing it? There are no laws separating races in the USA anymore, however there are still social stereotypes and pressure that leads to the mistreatment/unequal treatment of minorities. Should this totally be dismissed be cause it is a de facto instead of de jure treatment? While this issue is perhaps not on the same level, the underlying principle holds.

While I will concede that the legality of it has not reversed, the social pressure, societal perception, and mean/judgmental/rude things people have said to me still undermine and belittle my choice as a woman. All I am saying is I would like to be treated with respect and dignity by western society, for making a choice that causes no harm (and in my opinion is beneficial). I am not advocating other people have to take the same route, I would just like to be validated in society for putting my heart and best intention into something, just as the women who puts her heart into her work would like validation from society. 

I don't see how being a good wife, taking care of your family, prioritizing your role at home is an ill of society that needs to be fought off or purged.

edit: well even if you don't agree at least Switzerland does cause they have a whole school for it. We also had many ex and current Swiss Ambassadors to various countries as well as top CEO's come talk to us, and explain the expectations, specific challenges, pressure, and roles for the wife of some one in the public eye or with responsibility (political figure, diplomatic figure, CEO,  ect ect). Many of their wives have attended similar programs, if not the same program. They always told us how special, unique, and valuable we were as young women and how a good wife can make all the difference in a man.

Finally,

my husband shows me respect and respects our union in more ways than that. The difference is guys make the move. For example, a random girl is not going to try to kiss him or something. Even if that happened, she would not force or pressure it if he said no. In contrast, if I was in the same situation, guys make the move so it would be more likely to happen. Second, if he pressed I would have a harder time actually stopping the situation. Do you see the difference?  Respect can be mutual, even if it is not shown in the exact same manner. In addition, if there are going to be women present he always invites me to come along, always.

No, it isn't. As I've mention before, I don't think about sex all the time (I have thousand of other interests) and I don't dress with a sexual idea behind. I have a husband and I didn't dress anyway special to find him, neither did him (we actually met and fall in love during a ski excursion). A lot of women don't even want to have a husband or a boyfriend and are happy of their situation.

&gt; In contrast, if I was in the same situation, guys make the move so it would be more likely to happen.

There is no law here that doesn't allow girls to make the move. As well the law imposes the respect of the other person. So, if someone force you to kiss him or more, it would be considered a rape and pursued. Also there is not only sexual relationships between men and women: you know, people work together, have interests, amusements, etc. etc. In the world you imagine, people don't think anything else than sex and men rape women as soon as they can or as soon they see some skin; this isn't normal or actually, if it would be true, in the western world we would have only people doing sex everywhere and all the time.

While you personally may not dress a certain way to gain attention or appeal to me, surely you must concede this happens in general, or with somewhat of a frequent occurrence in society? One look through a magazine or on a T.V. show would support this. Of course girls can go to clubs for fun to dance with their friends, but they can also go to attract a potential partner, and how is this done? Acting and looking a certain way. 

Of course there is no law here that does not allow girls to make the move, but I think, even here, it is still more common for a guy to make the first move. I guess on this point, the bottom line is that my husband and I have decided that hanging out with members of the opposite is to be avoided and not healthy for our relationship. I think we have a right to define our relationship in a way that minimizes conflict and maximizes happiness.

true,Pshan2121,world,Other,"My husband and I, currently support homo-sexual relationships. Honestly, we have talked about this and ultimately we have decided on three things.  

1)We can not lie, probably we will be shocked at little confused/worried at first. We would probably experience a wide variety of emotions, one of which might be disappointment or fear. 

2) However, if two people really love each other then ultimately it is okay. God is love, so if two people are really in love, how is that not a sign God is present and giving his blessing? Who are we to go against the will of God? So you see, there is no right choice but to accept and support our son or daughter if this were to be the case. 

3). We do not support per-marital relations in any regards, this would be no different. Even if legal marriage is not an option, a commitment of the same emotional level would be needed to allow my daughter or son to live with this person or engage in sexual behaviors. 

Regarding your first question, women deciding not get married is actually fairly common and even an important aspect of our pr-existing culture.

true,berguina,null,null,"&gt; Are you judging the behavior or the person?

I'm not questioning the choice to follow a certain school or the choice to stay at home. I'm questioning the way you describe yourself (here and in the other post), as a, in my eyes, a tool for your husband. You never speak of yourself as a person, but as a woman or a wife. For me, men and women are equal (not complementary, but equal)

&gt;but they can also go to attract a potential partner, and how is this done? Acting and looking a certain way. 

And what's wrong attracting a partner? 
I'm just pointing out that dressing isn't only to attract partners and that a person should be respected independently of how s/he dresses. 
Also some women dresses in what you would call a very attractive way and they are interested in other women, you know?

&gt;Of course there is no law here that does not allow girls to make the move, but I think, even here, it is still more common for a guy to make the first move.

It's maybe still more common, but not always the case. Also, if a guy speaks to you in the 99,999999999% of the cases isn't to have a sexual relationship with you, but for other reasons. It's not that you see a person and have automatically sex with him/her. 
Or do you think that western girls don't do anything else than betray their husbands/boyfriends because they can speak to other men and even have a friendship with a man?
