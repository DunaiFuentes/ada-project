true,AlexTree,gr,Graubünden,"I actually have never been to Flumserberg so it might be the case that it is less crowded as it probably gets a lot of day visitors and those might not want to travel on the 24th. 4-5min sounds very low though, I remember days at Lenzerheide where I had to wait for 20-30min of course that is when it is completely packed.

Yeah I know what you mean and I think you wont have much problems to do that as I doubt that many ski schools already have fully booked classes and therefor those will fall away from the easier slopes. Another tip I can give you is to go early, I am not a morning person either but I will stand at the lift at 8 am and go up as you get 2-3 hours where there is hardly anyone.

I'm sure you can find one in Lauterbrunnen.  We stayed in Wilderswil for less than 100$ per day

* You have to weigh your vegetables immediately at the store, then get a tag.  That's how they do it, otherwise they think you are planning to steal them or something.

* restaurant meals are not worth the price mostly.  Try to eat at home.

* Frites (Fries) are excellent.

Other suggestions:

Zermatt - at the bases of the Matterhorn. Take the train gornergrat as well. 

Aareschlucht - the Aar gorge, near reichenbach falls, if you are also a Sherlock Holmes fan.  

Pilatus - the mountain that overlooks the lake of Lucerne. 

Davos/Klosters - just another nice mountain village. 

Rhein falls near Schaffhausen

Locarno - go to the dam nearby where the GoldenEye bungee jump was done, repeat for yourself. 

Bellinzona - lots of old castles

Customs - Sunday is a day of rest. Except in tourists spots and gas stations, nearly everything is closed Sunday. Just plan for it, and respect that people expect you to be quiet, not hang out laundry, etc. 

Although credit cards are becoming pretty widespread, it's a very cash-driven country. American credit cards (i.e. Not chip-and-PIN) can be hit or miss, but cash always works. Try to keep at least 200 CHF on you at all times. Also, there is no faux pas associated with using a big note to pay a small bill. 

Restaurant service will seem comparatively glacial. Once you order your meal, servers only come if summoned. Tips are included in the price of the meal, but if you wish to leave more they will of course take it. 5% is considered very generous. 

In general, the Swiss are not a warm or conversational people with strangers, particularly not the Swiss Germans. But the Swiss Germans do tend to verbally acknowledge all passers-by when not in a city. 

Learning how to say please, hello, goodbye, sorry, and ""can we use English"" in whatever the local language is goes a long way. The linguistic divisions in Switzerland are often very stark, and English is usually the best bet if you don't speak the local language. (For example, if you can't speak French in Neuchâtel, English will usually work better that German) also, if you speak German, understand that Swiss German is really a different language, and if you ask people to switch to Hochdeutsch, it will help.
