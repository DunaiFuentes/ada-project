Swiss banks also allowed themselves some pretty shady dealings under the banner of Swiss exceptionalism, including dealing with dictators, stealing deposited funds, and going into other countries to help their citizens violate tax law.  Note:  I do _not_ consider allowing someone to come into Switzerland to deposit money and keep it secret, whether they've paid tax or not, ""shady"".  

But the serial fuckups that our banks (and other companies) committed, while no worse than what other countries have done, tend to get people pissed at the easy target.

On top of that, it is natural to try and drum up political support by pushing an ""us-vs-them"" agenda.

Lastly, let's face it, the Swiss have always been shit at competing internationally - we're good at being reliable and high-quality, not at playing with the big boys in international business and politics.

true,DeepBlueNemesis,bs,Beide Basel,"In recent years Switzerland had to change some laws as a result of international agreements or pressure and some people think that is the same as being exploited. 

Examples would be the death of the bank secret, the data theft of Germany or things like Schengen which surrenders some of our border control. With things such as the automatic acceptance of EU law or the ""foreign judges"" affair further down the pipeline people think that Switzerland's sovereignty is being attacked and we are just giving up privileges  (and with it, identity) without actually getting anything in return. 

I wouldn't call it fear mongering, but a lot of attention is being brought to this issue (mostly by the right-wing nationalistic parties) and there is a lot of drama going on. On the other hand it cannot be denied that Switzerland has been forced to change some of its laws as a result of international pressure.

While I personally think that we're far from being exploited by other countries we are currently experiencing some consequences that come with globalization that are not in our favour - global standards that are different with our own for example (mostly regarding banking laws, exchange of data and how to tax people (for example did nobody else differ between ""Steuerhinterziehung"" and ""Steuerbetrug"", and as a result Switzerland had to abolish that)). Some other issues (such as Schengen) come with upsides that some people just do not recognize, but that falls under the ""You can't please everyone"" category. Employers and frequent travelers are incredibly happy about this change, people that have no connection with either of those categories (such as self-employers in regions far from the border) do not recognize this as an advantage. 

In conclusion, the wind of change is blowing. People don't necessarily like that, and when you combine that with the ""We are a strong nation on our own and don't need anybody else!""-spirit that accompanied us through WW2 and the cold war and is still echoing today you have a lot of sceptics.

true,Vlip,be,Bern,"You have to put it in context.

After the no to the EEE votation, for years Switzerland coasted on an easy ride foreign policy wide. The EU was over eager to be nice to us (hey maybe if we are nice they'll change their minds and join us) and our neighbours were nice too. Our bilateral treaties were pretty much everything Switzerland wanted them to be.
Somehow the Swiss think that this was normal and not the result of a freak set of circumstances (the EU being unwilling/unable to throw its weight around for example amongst other things).


Fast forward to today where, for another freak set of circumstance (global crisis, swiss banks being utter morons,...) it seems everyone is dog piling us:

The EU wants our blood on taxation

The EU flatly tells us they don't have the time to entertain our needs and negotiate with us. So we should just agree to take over EU law directly and be done with it.

Germany wants our blood on taxation.

Germany has no interest in giving half an inch on the Zurich airport situation, why would they?

The US is on a ruthless hunt for the head of our banks while they give a blank check to do whatever they want to their own banks.

The US wants our blood on taxation.

Add the Lybian affair on top of it and you should see why some Swiss feel like the world it out to get us.


To be honest, they aren't wrong. The world is a bloody sea filled with huge fishes that only care for their interests. It has always been so but it's only getting worse.
When Switzerland decided to snub the EU we told the world we were going to fight in that fish pond alone and now we are starting to see what that arrogant assumption really means. Any country bigger than us can bully us and we are pretty much helpless to stop them.

Basically it boils down to Sovereignty. Who is more sovereign?

The nation alone who gets bullied by everyone?

Or

The nation in a bigger group who has to share decision making with the others in the group but can resist bullies as a group?

true,CaptainDread,lu,Luzern,"This is largely fear-mongering and cheap populism. The sentiment of isolationism in its current form arguably harks back to the EWR referendum in 1992 where the dichotomy of us vs. them basically became the defining issue of modern Switzerland - at least in a certain (then up and coming) party's rhetoric. Consequently, this led to the outsized paranoia and fears concerning immigrants and many things foreign. The EWR vote, even if it was fairly close, practically hard-wired politicians to stress ""Swissness"" and to be wary of statements suggesting Switzerland should conform or even approach foreign interests.

Think about Ueli Maurer's speech from 1 August: he described Switzerland as ""David"" fighting the foreign ""Goliath"". Forget for a moment the ridiculous scope of that analogy; the sentiment Maurer obviously thinks addresses many Swiss people's concerns is, as you say, that ""we"" are being threatened (I don't know about exploited but that probably comes with it by implication) by ""the others"" when the reality is nowhere near that. There is some international pressure on Switzerland, yes, but largely caused by our financial policies and the now outdated notion of neutrality.

The reason why this seems to have entered the national consciousness might be the ""inward escape"" reflex many people seem to feel. The global weakening of defined national traits could explain to some extent why many things un-Swiss, including foreign countries, are seen as threatening, taking advantage of, or even exploit good old Helvetia.

And another reason, which is far less abstract, is that the country's strongest party has elevated this narrative to official party lore (and thus, in many party members' views, national lore, since they like to see themselves as the only ""real"" Swiss party). I think this has a considerable effect on the other parties as well because if they flat-out reject these notions, they will be termed ""EU slaves"" or something like that fairly quickly.

To summarise: the 1992 EWR referendum set the course, isolationism trumped openness, the SVP gained members and importance and succeeded in convincing at least a quarter of Swiss people now believe that Switzerland is constantly being harrassed and exploited by foreign powers and their interests.",0,1375612342,null,0,false,0,cbgnggx,t3_1jo8so,t1_cbgnggx,t3_1jo8so,null,1429950794,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

At the same time the EU wants to be more competitive with the US and the Chinese market, and to do that they need to remove most intrinistic boundaries and trade barriers. That puts a lot of pressure on its member states and on Switzerland too, mostly due to its geographical presence in the heart of Europe, sitting on the very important North-South axis between Germany/Rotterdam and Italy (the 4th biggest economy in the EU).
