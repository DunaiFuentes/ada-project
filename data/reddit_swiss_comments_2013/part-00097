Most big cinema-lines (Pathé, Kitag) are in for the mass appeal - that means German dubbed movies for all those who don't understand (or don't want to understand) the spoken English in the movies (which is the majority of Switzerland) or those who want the original language - but with a failsafe in case it gets complicated. Subtitles are really not that bothersome if you chose to ignore them, and they're a great help to everyone who wants it. 

Some smaller cinemas may want to appeal to the very fringe population that wants neither dubs nor subs, but that's not really an option for larger ones.
