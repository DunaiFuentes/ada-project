There are two different kind of raclette 'devices', if you have the cheap regular one it comes sometimes in combo with 'tischgrill'(table grill). It has a plate on it, where you can put veggies or raw meat (bacon, small cut steaks, small sausages and whatnot) and grill them (start with the bacon, it greases the plate for the rest)... you usually serve it with different sauces. Both together make a for a delicious feast, if you have the opportunity I strongly recommend it.

About traditions it really depends on you and your friends.

true,canteloupy,vd,Vaud,"Let's get something straight : the traditional raclette like my grandpa makes and like you get in alpine restaurants is a half round of cheese on a rotating heater, scraped onto plates one after the other as each waits his turn, with pickles and onions and small baked potatoes. You get a platter of dried meats as a starter and drink white wine like Johannisberg or Petite Arvine or any other from Valais. Liberal use of black pepper is encouraged and if you don't drink wine you can take sweet black tea.

Now, some people don't like this. Most people don't have a big rotating raclette apparatus and don't finish half a round of cheese, so eat slices in an electric heater, which has the advantage of not making you wait. And some find that boring so they add in pickled mushrooms, vegetables and bacon and spices, I've even had that in a tourist trap in Zürich and didn't really like it. But there is a middle ground so if you are not a purist like me and want more fun you can add more cold cuts, look into the meat from Grisons and some bacon with herbs for instance.

How to make raclette (my way) (oh god why am I posting this on this subreddit, I'll get kicked out of the country)
You'll need:

* Raclette cheese. You can use some other similar cheeses but come on. The proper way is to take a half of a whole Raclette and something like this: http://www.cuisinstore.com/media/imageCMS/appareil-a-raclette-breziere-411-350x350.jpg to melt it from one side, but cutting the cheese in small slices and using this: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kjg8K4zG5Ro/T10RxNHkiZI/AAAAAAAAMPk/I307yu3KQMs/s1600/raclette3.jpg also works
* Meat: ham, speck, ""viande des grisons"", basically thin slices of tasty meat. If you use the second type of raclette grill above, you can usually cook meat on top too.
* Potatoes. Smaller potatoes are better in my opinion. I boil them in salty water and I don't peel them. It keeps them more firm.
* Pickles, pickled onions, and a friend of mine introduced me to the goodness of having thick slices of fresh mushrooms too - incrediby good.
* Spices. I'm not sure what are the spices in raclette but you can buy a raclette spice mix at any coop.
* White wine to serve on the side. I prefer Riesling, but your choice - sweet and savory wines work best. (Wikipedia says: ""Local tradition cautions that other drinks – water for example – will cause the cheese to harden in the stomach, leading to indigestion."" and I concur)

But some Swiss people here are saying they eat meat too. Maybe it's a Zürich thing to have meet-free raclette, then?

true,startwearinggreen,france,french in Zürich,"MWST is what you'd call ""VAT"". If you buy inside of Switzerland you pay it anyway with the goods you buy. But you won't pay the foreign VAT in that case.

I'm not sure how it works when ordering from the US, but when you order from Europe, you shouldn't be charged VAT in the country you buy from. That can actually be VERY interesting: if you buy something online on a French store, for instance, the normal VAT would be 19.6%. But since you're buying from Switzerland, you don't pay that. Customs will bill you (through your carrier, usually) the swiss MWST, and possibly some customs duty (if you buy more than some amount of CHF worth of goods, or if you buy specially taxed goods like tobacco, alcohol, etc. no idea if that applies to e-cigs). So for most goods, bought in small quantities, you end up paying the French price (instead of the Swiss price) with a Swiss MWST (8% instead of 19.6%). Of course you also pay more in shipping and you might have some customs duty to pay. It's said it's even more interesting to buy from Germany.

Caveat: the seller might not automatically deduct their local VAT, you have to check before you pay and you may need to tell them to lift the VAT from your order. Bigger sites like Amazon already do it automatically though.

It also works if you buy abroad in a physical store, but it's more complicated: you pay the VAT in the foreign store, get a tax refund form from them, drive to the border, pay the Swiss MWST, get the form stamped or something, go home, mail them the form and they refund the VAT after a while. Depending on the seller they may take long and be not quite cooperative, e.g. they may not have the forms at hand or not know what you're talking about (though if you're buying from a city near the border, like Konstanz, they are very much used to it).

So, short answer, if I were you I'd double check whether e-cigs are subject to special taxes like tobacco, and if not, I'd look at the prices in Germany.
