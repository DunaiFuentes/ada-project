For CERN, your visit will be mostly organised by the CERN Visits folk, so I can't tell you what to see and where to go. You'll probably get to see all the places I have in mind, anyway.

However, keep two things in mind:

1. Keep your camera ready. You might not be able to stop for long at some places so it'll help to have your camera / phone ready to take pictures.
2. Ask questions! Your guides and the other people you meet will be happy to answer any and all questions you may have. Take down their e-mail addresses if you wish to stay in touch and, who knows, come over to CERN for internships in the future.

Hope this helps! Have a great trip to Geneva and CERN. The weather's mostly decent this week, although we're expecting some rain tomorrow.

On Happiness: Low depression numbers might have something to do that it isn't reported.

As the stress level indicates we're hard working and it's in our culture that you always have to be working and never tell anybody how great your life is, since you don't have to work very hard at the moment. ""How are you?"" ""Well, I'm busy working."" That's a typical Swiss conversation.

Also our high suicide rate (highest in Europe IIRC, *EDIT: I didn't*) indicates that it's not all great. I heard however it's going down since the military allows the military rifle to be stored on site rather than at home. But that might also just be gun related suicides.

Now, I can also recommend you something more ""social"", i.e. casual: try Meetup, for a start.

There's this ""Language Exchange Group"" (http://www.meetup.com/Zurichs-Language-Exchange/), which is basically a nice group of people who gather every Tuesday evening on central Starbucks to practice German between them. It is mostly attended by expats but many native German speakers go as well to help us out. What does this has to do with Spanish? Well, every now and then, they organize an Experimental Meetup with other languages precisely for people to practice French/Spanish/Portuguese etc. Several Spanish speakers usually come by. Don't know when the next one is, but I think it is either monthly or bi-monthly.
Also on Meetup, try these groups - http://www.meetup.com/Espanoles-expratiados-en-Zurich/ and http://www.meetup.com/Zurich-hispanohablante/. They seem to be really towards social activities, but who knows if they can help you with that. Maybe you will find a qualified instructor there, or someone related. Give it a try.
