About the cable train: it does seem like it's been closed, perhaps [permanently] (http://www.srf.ch/player/radio/rendez-vous/audio/seilbahn-lungern-schoenbueel-muss-den-betrieb-einstellen?id=a8c74181-262c-4841-a703-5e96ac073dd3).

The only alternative I can think of is the [Papiliorama] (http://www.papiliorama.ch/default.asp?OrgID=5&amp;Language=EN) in Kerzers. Not much of a hike but plenty of butterflies, I hear. However, it seems like the kind of place you might have already been to.
