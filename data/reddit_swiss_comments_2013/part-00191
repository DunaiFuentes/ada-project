You could lower your costs if you share a flat with other students. The cheapest you will find for your own little 20m2 apartment is around 800 (with a lot of luck and months spent searching for it). If you rent an apartment with other people, you should be able to lower that to 600 if you're lucky. Phone/Internet/TV easily costs 100-150, but I guess you could also get it a lot cheaper if you're willing to have only basic TV, a pre paid phone and slow internet (imo you should at least go for a good internet connection). Health insurance usually costs 200-250, but I know that there are special offers for foreign students. Food is also such a thing: it really depends on what cuts you're willing to make. You can survive eating only 500gr of spaghetti a day, this would cost you 47 cents a day. If you want to have a somewhat normal, but still cheap diet, it's around 15-20 a day.

IMO you can survive with 1200/month (rent: 600, communications: 50, health care: 200, food: 300, other: 50), but that's not easy. If you want an idea about food prices, take a look here: http://www.leshop.ch/leshop/Main.do?currentMenu=SHOP_SUPERMARKET. You can get most of it a little bit cheaper if you buy it in big discounters like ALDI/LIDL, but it won't be huge difference.

As far as I know, internet is always unlimited. I'm downloading several hundred GBs of data every month on my computer (on top of HD TV that goes over the internet too for me) and I never heard of any limitation. They offer only 20'000 kbit/s as max speed for the moment (you can find up to 150 from another company), but they will up those speeds in the next years (up to 1000Mbit/s at the end of 2013 for some people, http://bit.ly/13VDpaG).

Health insurance is mandatory, but like I said, contact the EPFL administration and ask them for special offers for foreign students. They should be able to tell you if it still exists and if yes, where.

Baseless asumption and speculation

&gt; to got ride some horses in liberty during his goddamn sentence

The article never states that he went to ride horses; it is far more likely that he was working there. Liberty is the wrong word again (see above) especially since there would be several people at the ranch. 

Furthermore this was part of his rehabilitation program *which is part of any goddamn sentence*. He was sentenced to 15 years in jail, over a decade ago. You have no idea at which point he started his rehabilitation and was moved to a special facility, thus you have no idea how long he spent in ""actual jail"".

You do not know that, you are simply guessing based on the result. This summer a handcuffed man who was escored by 4 (four) police officers managed to tackle one of them, get that policeman's gun and shoot himself. How do you know that man was not restrained? You don't. You just assume. 

&gt;  If we had to rank the dagerousity of people in this country, he would probably be in the top 0.005% - even before yesterday.

&gt; So please, don't try arguing that anyone with a brain should say ''yeah, that guy surely isn't that dangerous anymore, let's just throw a woman at him, give him the power to decide and look how it works out''.

At some point any man and any woman will be dismissed from jail and walk free among us. There are *very* few exceptions but since those are all you ever hear about you think it's common. For that man it may have been too early, but even so he would have been free again in 2018 just like he was in 2001 when he raped those women. Every year dozens of criminals that spent longer in jail than that man are released onto Swiss streets again - and let me tell you something: I want them to have the best therapy they can get so they don't ever go back to jail again - because that means they're not hurting anyone ever again. 

Of course it's a lot more convenient to just lock them up and forget about them, but that's not how Justice works, that's not how reason works and that's a lot more expensive than paying therapy for those people and releasing them a mere 6 months earlier (usually they are released on parole a lot earlier though). 

&gt; An unarmed woman driving a car with a non restrained man probably sitting right next to her.

Again, you are just guessing to support your argument.

What I would like to know is what the Air Force plans to do when then the Hornets reach the end of their lifespan. The Gripen sure is a legit replacement for the Tiger, but it doesn't have much room for further improvement unlike the Rafale and the Eurofighter. Ever since WWII Switzerland had a fleet consisting of high performance fighters and supporting cheaper aircraft(Vampire/Mustang, Mirage/Hunter, Hornet/Tiger). Some of Maurer's statements indicate that the plans are to abandon this model and switch to a single type of fighter in the future, which offers some advantages(less complicated supply chain, reduction of infrastructure etc.) but making the airforce dependent on one single type also grounds the whole air force if this one type gets grounded for any reason(technical difficulties or political huff with the nation that delivers the plane). 

For me the question if we should buy the Gripen remains open as long as we don't know what the plans for the future are, if there are any.",0,1379090844,null,0,false,0,cc7n959,t3_1mblz1,t1_cc7n959,t3_1mblz1,null,1429476455,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5
true,chromopila,zh,ZÃ¼rich,"&gt;  We have nearly 0.8 jets per 1,000 square kilometers

Denmark has 1.1, Belgium has 1.6 and the Netherlands have 1.8. 

&gt; Austria with a similar topography has four times fewer aircraft.

Austria has one of the most sophisticated radar systems in all of Europe and more sophisticated airplanes. But the Austrian Air Force isn't really a good measure for anything because they are heavily limited by treaties made during the occupation after WWII",0,1379091448,null,0,false,0,cc7nh2u,t3_1mblz1,t1_cc7nh2u,t1_cc7n3lc,null,1429476352,8,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,8

And I agree with you that there are structural changes to the Air Force that should be discussed more, but I really can't imagine a majority of people supporting buying another batch of fighters to complement the ones we are buying now.

true,ALTSuzzxingcoh,be,73% sexist - 100% swiss (Bern),"To be honest, while I'm not educated in any way in this area, I really don't feel they contribute much to general security. There are two uses fighter jets can be put to; either in a war or as a police patrol slash interceptor. Let's be honest here, brutally honest: The only powers that could ever think of starting a war in modern europe are extraeuropean, meaning we don't stand a chance against them. Or more to the point, they'll overcome our air force through technological and numerical superiority. Russia, China, the US. The thought of armies standing against each other and maintaining a strategical balance is absurd in a region like ours. We ain't got nothing. The only thing we could hope for is personal survival.

The other use as a police service, I'm not very positive on, either. As far as I know, we haven't yet had to intercept any aircraft by use of force, so we wouldn't know the outcome. Never mind the incredible speed at which terrorists could hijack a starting plane in Kloten and ram it into Leibstadt/GÃ¶sgen. I really don't count on the few jets that might be in the air at any given time - more than likely not - to protect me from any realistic catastrophical event. There was a discussion about having 33 F/A-18s, a third of which only ever being in service at a time. I wouldn't count on them to be armed, other than maybe their onboard cannon.
