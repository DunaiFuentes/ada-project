true,hubert41,null,null,"Long time dating websites user here. Most websites are utter shit, full of really boring people who can't handle a discussion or reply more than a few words. Here's a little review:

* **[Okcupid](http://okcupid.com)**, even if there aren't many people on it, is from far the most interesting one.
* **[Anibis](http://anibis.ch/)** aka the Swiss craigslist, you'll find hundreds of classified ads for the most perverted shit human mind can come up with. Have fun.
* **[adopteunmec](http://adopteunmec.com)** (french): free, funny concept, there are a lot of people, but overall it's very superficial
* **[swissfriends](http://swissfriends.ch)**: shitty, ugly website with lots of profile of really boring and dull people. Same kind of people you see at the mall on Saturday.
* **[Badoo](http://badoo.ch)**: The absolute worst. I believe most people there don't actually know how to write. But I met two pretty cool girls from there, so give it a try.
* **[POF](http://www.pof.com/)**: ugly and terrible usability, and apparently they think it's a good idea to redirect you to the German website no matter what language you speak, but there are some profiles
* **[Reddit r4r Europe](/r/euro4euro)**: never tried it, but I suppose people there will be more interesting.
* **[Facebook](http://facebook.com)**: A friend of a friend looks cute? Add her! She's likely to accept if she knows the common friend and you have a decent picture of yourself up. Also, check who else is going to the events you join (concerts, etc...), if someone seems interesting chat them up a bit and suggest you have a drink there.

Overall, after years of experience, my advice would be to not bother with anything else than Okcupid and Facebook, the rest is just a waste of time and will consume your faith in humanity pretty quick (unless you have very low standards). Most girls get dozens of aggressive messages per day and they barely reply anything. Also, if you just want to socialize with people, I highly recommend couchsurfing, you'll find a lot of mostly educated, curious, social and adventurous people there.
