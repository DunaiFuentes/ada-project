You're here for a couple of years at least. Try to be a part of it! You will ALWAYS be the foreigner as long as you don't speak the language. I know Germans that are here for 30+years and still just speak High German and I will never ever treat them as Swiss. 


So please, try to learn it :) Naturally, learning German is the base for for Swiss German. But as soon as you managed that, you can start understanding/speaking Swiss German. Practice is as usual the key here, find a Swiss person to practice and don't be afraid to make mistakes, that's inevitable. But you can learn from those and gradually you'll get better and better.

And then Swiss people switch to High German. But why, God, why! I have done it too in the past, but I've come to stop. If the person speaks High German to me and obviously doesn't understand Swiss German -fine. But if they actually try to speak Swiss German, then they're also going to understand. So by switching to High German, you're telling them ""you suck, let's speak this other language instead"". That might be true, but how about you respect their wish to speak said language?
