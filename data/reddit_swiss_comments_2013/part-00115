Edit:

The convo translated:

Richi (son): ""Oh, I want to leave the dredge."" [in a really whiny voice]

Dad: ""You wanna leave?""

R: ""Yeah..."" [still really whiny]

D: ""Let's see if we can open the door here... poorly... but look, I can lift you out of it! Hold on to my fingers really tight and I lift you out [the dager]. Okay... hold on... with the other hand as well Hold on tight!""

**RICHI FALLS**

D: ""Godda... RICHI! I TOLD YOU TO HOLD TIGHT!""

R: *bwah*

D: (talking to his wife) ""First off he cries because some gear hits him again, although I told him it's going to happen all over again. Then he asks me to leave, and I tell him to hold on tight [on the fingers] and then he lets himself drop mid-air...!!""
