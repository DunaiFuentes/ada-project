true,ElucTheG33K,vd,Vaud,"Thanks for these informations. From my view, living in California good points are: more interesting job for engineers, free to innovate without too much barrier, very nice weather (today's weather is particularity depressing around Leman Lake), cheaper electronics, cheaper (and bigger) houses, cheaper and better entertainment (lot of theme parks), cheaper and more choice of restaurants (with free refill on Coke, it's heaven for me), cheaper shopping, cheaper cars (electric cars heaven!), faster internet (not sure about that) and maybe more. 
The bad points seams to be: long working hours (but if the job passionate me, it should not be a big problem), bad health care (but good job with good salary could solve that, no?), internet is over watched (VPN could solve that), houses are not made of concrete (better not living in a hurricane area), some people have guns on them (and they are not cops).

true,mikekn,zh,Zürich,"OP here. Why on earth do you think these are reasons why Switzerland sucks?

Let me make one thing totally clear: I love Switzerland. I like the people, I like my working environment, I like the consensus politics (and I like the common resentment against people who threaten that consensus), I like the fact that stuff just works, I like the fact that people generally give a damn about their environment, I like the fact that despite having the lowest rate of incarceration for violent offenderse on the planet it still has one of the planet's lowest rates of violent crime. I like the fact that when it snows the snowploughs will probably have been through and cleared not only the road but the sidewalks within the hour. I like the fact that it's a healthy enough society that people don't insist on driving their kids the 500 metres to school through fear of imaginary child molesters. I even appreciate the fact that meat is expensive, because it means that standards in animal welfare and meat production are high rather than prices being driven artifically down by factory farming.

All that said, I also know that there are people who move to Switzerland and end up not liking it and going home because it wasn't what they expected, or simply because they find it too different, and I think the culture shock for Americans coming from the USA is often greater than that for Europeans (even the British, of which I am one). Europe simply doesn't have the 24-hour, ""customer is king"", drive-down-prices-at-all-costs-screw-the-workers attitude that dominates so much in the US, and because this is even less the case in Switzerland than it is in most of the rest of Europe some people are going to have a nasty shock if they don't do their homework and their research and concentrate only on picture postcard impressions.",0,1382518488,null,0,false,0,ccxqzi6,t3_1oxjoq,t1_ccxqzi6,t1_ccxqta9,null,1429016229,9,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,9

Obviously there are different ways to assume that mission.

1: Do it yourself

I can live with both. What I very much dislike is that neither/or mode we have right now. There is no political will to take option 1 seriously and hence we have our current weak situation. There is also no way in hell we are going to have a majority of this country accept the notion of letting foreign airforces take over our airspace so option 2 is not possible either.

IMO, it would be much more feasible to dump other army duties and build up the airforce so that it can truly do its job than to try to get a majority of people to go for option 2. Especially since option 2 is probably not going to be as cheap as you think.

Admittedly, all such scenarios are quite unlikely for Switzerland. Any hostile airborne force would need to go through Swiss friendly airspace first, where they are likely to be dealt with. A situation such as a hijacking that happens within Swiss airspace would probably reach its target before fighters can be scrambled. So I can see the argument that a Swiss airforce is useless.

true,Vlip,be,Bern,"Because fighter jets are hangar queens and pilots need constant training.
So basically you'll always have a significant amount of your fighters in maintenance (which is why one of the most important criteria in fighter jet procurement program nowadays is ease of maintenance and how many flight hours you get between said maintenance) and a significant amount of your fighters being used to train pilots. That leaves you with not so much for actual engagement when your fleet is in the low fifties.

Do a few days of 24/24 coverage like with the WEF and you end up having pretty much your whole fleet in maintenance.


The ""obvious"" idea is to find something else than a fighter jet to handle that mission to save money but the problem is, you need something that can go faster than commercial jets, climb to commercial jet altitude extremly fast, operate and find their target during all weather. That pretty much leaves only fighter jets as of today. The Grippen being a cheap fighter jet with supposedly low maintenance is actually not a bad choice if your main mission is to do air police.

The Hunters we have left are museum pieces (IE, in actual museums) or one or two owned by a few enthusiasts as tourist attractions. 
The Tigers we have are reaching their end of life in the sense that they will break apart if we keep using them.


If it were up to me I'd buy twice as many Grippen today and fase off the F18s in one decade in exchange for as many Grippens. That way it might be possible to offer real 7/7 24/24 coverage.
