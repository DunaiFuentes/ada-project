true,DeepBlueNemesis,bs,Beide Basel,"I'm not entirely sure what this (slightly biased) article is about. Is it a response to the headlines that were in the papers? Tagged walls, looted shops, broken windows and demolished construction sites are things the general public (those who the Schoch family apparently want to appeal to) don't want to see, and eventually care about the most. 

Is it an attempt at explaining why it happened? The article has a very ""It happened, deal with it"" vibe - no remorse can be felt, no attempts at clearing up how it could escalate were made (apart from ""Fuck the Police"") and no explanation was given. 

Did the author want to bring attention to the police raid the following day? If so, it's a rather unfortunate choice to describe the community (repeatedly) as ""free of all laws"" and ""fighting against the authority"" after describing (very nonchalantly and without mentioning any of those pesky details) just how much damage a single party of that community caused. And the closing statement is ""We'll keep fighting""? Oh man, you're certainly not going to get a lot of sympathies out of that article. 

All that aside I'm sad that they're slowly getting rid of all the alternative areas (they tore down the Villa Rosenau in Basel after a fire a couple of weeks back) and while I support having a replacement area the Schoch family really needs to get their shit together and do whatever they can to prevent something like this.

I see that they are calling their place a ""self-made haven.""  No, it is not ""self-made"", you took over the property that was built for someone else with their own money, and they now need to repurpose it.  Now please GTFO.

This article makes ""The Schoch Family"" sound like a bunch of entitled teens and absolute idiots.  They seem to be a nuisance to the community around them - leaving noise, garbage, mayhem and general destruction in their wake.  I'd hate to be a resident living near them -- must be impossible to sleep at night.

I've known teenagers like this growing up -- they think they're entitled to have unlimited fun while the residents around them suffer.  These are the types that believe they are ""artists"" and special little snowflakes and have zero regard for the person standing next to them, unless it is a fellow ""artist.""  Usually police presence is needed, and a good ass-kicking also in order for them to grow up.
