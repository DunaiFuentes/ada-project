true,rockenrohl,null,null,"I'm going out on a limb here, some will surely disagree (which is already a typical Swiss quality - a wide-spread respect for different opinions, and an ability to work out compromises): We ""feel united"" (it's maybe too strong a term) because, with four different language zones and many different cultures (already in the middle ages/early modern age, cultures between West and East, between peasants and cities, then of course between catholics and protestants, were often deeply divided), we have for quite some time, surely since 1848, and we are still always trying to work something out that works for everyone (something everyone can at least live with). 


From this, imho, follows (and this therefore unites us), that we have respect for authority and the rule of law. Although voices against politicians, against Bern etc. have gotten louder in the last twenty or so years, the average Swiss likes to live here, likes the institutions, and likes to follow the laws (or at least: it's ""selbstverständlich"", nothing you have to think about - and you automatically also expect your compatriots to follow the rules). There's a part in the Baselbieter Lied (very patriotic, of course, from the Canton of Basel Land), and it goes like this:

Me sait vom Baselbieter
und red’ ihm öppe no
er säg nu: «Mir wei luege…»,
er chönn nit säge «Jo».
Doch tuesch ihn öppe froge,
«Wit du fürs Rächt ystoh?»,
do heisst’s nit, dass me luege well,
do säge alli «Jo».

Rough translation: They say about those from Baselland they only say ""we'll see"", they can't say ""yes, sure"". But if you ask him: Will you hold up the rule of law, then they don't say they'll see, then everyone says ""yes"".

I think this still to this day is valid for all of Switzerland, in a way. It's seldom stated explicitly, at least I don't think it is. But in the things that are self-evident is maybe what answers your question - that what connects/unites us.
