true,elFlexor,lu,Luzern,"In late december there's usually a lot of christmas markets (""christchindlimärt"") everywhere, those are really nice. Just grab some mulled wine and stroll around the market stands.

Also, in Lucerne there's at least two outdoor ice skating thingies at the lake before christmas, which are illuminated nicely in the evenings. I live in Lucerne, so I can't tell you about Zurich but I know they have something like that, too.

Apart from that, you can pretty much do all the other things that you would normally do (check out other posts on this sub). Depending on when you are in Lucerne, sometimes there is a christmas market atop Mt. Pilatus, so you could combine the mountains with the christmas thing.

I can't think of anything else at the moment.

PS: Lucerne is a 45min train ride away from Zurich and other places are reached easily as well, so if you find something that interests you it's not a big deal if you're not staying in that particular town.",0,1372949057,null,0,false,0,cavudps,t3_1hmsuz,t1_cavudps,t3_1hmsuz,null,1430585703,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
