true,[deleted],null,null,"No sweat.  It's a nice place, I really like it, it also has its downsides (can be very parochial, very expensive, the direct democracy can be a bit frustrating at times).

So in response to your questions:

\1. Yes, it's the highest constitutional instance in the land.  The Bundesgericht is actually broken down into several components - [the German wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesgericht_\(Schweiz\)) (run it through Google) has a decent explanation.  

Swiss law is fundamentally split into two parts - civil and criminal law.  The civil law has two main components - the ""zivilgesetzbuch (ZGB), civil law book, and the ""obligationenrecht"" (OR), or contract law.  They're both online if you're curious, very understandable and accessible at admin.ch, and both derived from the constitution.  The Bundesgericht civil instance would hear all cases deriving from these.  

What I do not know is who in the Bundesgericht (both the civil and criminal portions are part of the BG, look at that wikipedia link) would hear constitutional cases related to criminal law.  I guess the division isn't _quite_ that clear.  I am also not a lawyer.  For structural purposes, though, both the civil and criminal bits are considered part of the Bundesgericht overall, though.

\2. Not quite.  There are certain things which may escalate up through the courts.  However, with legislative and executive things, it's important to understand that concept of ""subsidiarity"" that I mentioned.  

National laws will override cantonal will override local in certain circumstances.  Generally the split federal/cantonal is more pronounced since most of the administration is on a cantonal level (schools, roads, health, etc.) but the federal level only has precedence in issues where the cantons are not capable of handling something on their own.  Or, in the case of the constitutional court, if someone challenges a law's constitutionality.  This leads to what in Swiss German is called the ""Kantönligeist"", meaning the ""little canton spirit"" - everyone only giving a shit about what happens locally.  It can lead to inefficiency, such as having large hospitals in out-of-the-way places, but also ensures a large degree of local/regional sovereignty.  

There's historically generally a distrust in certain matters of central authority.  Sometimes the local/cantonal/federal functions are complementary, such as police - all cantons have a cantonal police, which performs most of the ""heavy lifting"" work.  Larger cities and towns have local police which will handle local issues, and generally work with the cantonal police.  The federal police handles crimes on a national level, such as inter-cantonal issues, cooperation with Interpol, etc.

Occasionally there are sovereignty conflicts.  A good example is the current shitfight in Zurich between the canton and city;  the city government is very left/green and desperately wants to close one lane of a busy road to make a bike path (they actively obstruct car traffic as a matter of policy.)  This road is the responsibility of the city, but it's of cantonal interest as it's a major thoroughfare.  The canton's said, no, fuck off, you can't close it.  The city then went ahead and closed it ""for maintenance purposes"".  This is typical of the kind of seemingly banal thing they will have a go at each other about.

\3. No.  The chancellor usually hangs around with them, i.e. joins them at meetings and outings.  He/she also has a lot of ceremonial functions.  But that post is pretty much administrative in nature.  While the chancellor is elected, the federal councillors are the ones who make the decisions.  

Remember also that historically the federal council works on the ""collegiality"" principle - this means that they're supposed to (a) not be dicks to each other and (b) present decisions taken in chambers as a unified body, without talking smack outside, even if they disagree in private.  This has suffered quite a bit in recent years, primarily due to the increased viciousness of party politics.

The second thing to know is the ""magic formula"" - it's an unwritten dictum that the major parties (from left to right, SP, CVP, FDP, SVP) should contribute 2, 2, 2, and 1 Bundesrat respectively - the voting usually just ended up this way.  Due to the SVP gaining a lot of votes at the CVP's expense (a lot of people felt that Swiss taxes and the size of the state were becoming too much, and the country was going too far in the direction of Europe, so they tended to vote for the increasingly right-wing SVP) the formula became 2, 1, 2, 2.  Then the SVP split because some people felt they were _too_ knee-jerk, so now it's 2 SP, 1 CVP, 2 FDP, 1 SVP, 1 BDP.  I think.  Point being, there is an unwritten rule about who is represented.

\4. Most (all?) cantons have an equivalent body to the federal council.  It's executive in function at the cantonal level, so the answer would be ""sort of"".

\5. Sorry:  Bundesrat = federal council, conseil fédéral.  Bundeskanzler = federal chancellor.  Bundesgericht = federal court.  Generally, the terms ""Bund"" or ""Eidgenossenschaft"" (literally ""oath community"", the traditional term for Switzerland based on the legendary bunch of farmers from three original cantons getting together and swearing mutual defense in 1291 on the Rütli - this is part of the whole William Tell thing) are re used to refer to the federal government.  Nobody ever uses the term ""national"" except in reference to certain institutions - such as the National Fund (a scientific and social research budget organization), national library, etc.",0,1361257660,null,0,1361258200,0,c8hpio9,t3_18rkez,t1_c8hpio9,t1_c8hhorj,null,1431337573,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4
true,DeepDuh,zh,Zürich,"I forgot to explain the other 80%. Here's the deal: In Germany as well as Switzerland, most people go the route of professional education. That means taking a 50-80% apprenticeship at age 16, passing the 'pro' Matura at age 19, then going to a technical university ('fachhochschule') either part time or full time (ideally). At least in Switzerland that career route is built well enough such that people can do that and still arrive at very well payed jobs later on. That being said, I often experience a bit of a divide between 'academics' and 'pros' if you want. The academics just tend to be generalists while pros tend to be specialized in a specific field.

Also it would make sense to establish within this new federal police a department that focuses on cyber attacks/crime. In this way the cantonal police forces could hand over this task to such a body - this would increase efficiency.

true,buyacasha,zh,Zürich,"It has been somewhat explained already, but not completely. So here goes:
The Swiss middle school system is actually divided into three tiers that go from Realschule over Sekundarschule to Gymnasium. The first two take three years and are then followed by a professional apprenticeship (Which again is divided into work for an employer and school. Also, such an employer actually needs to be approved before being able to take apprentices). The third tier, the gymnasium which is concluded with the Matura test, usually then leads to university. Now what you need to understand is that there are generally no bad gymnasiums as there might be bad high schools in the US (So comparing a gymnasium to a high school is not that easy. Someone who would do bad at some US high school might not even be in high school in Switzerland, but in a more fitting Sekundarschule or Realschule. That's where that 20% number comes from). Since Switzerland pays for all costs for a student at university (minus some more or less symbolic student fee), it is only natural that it can dictate that everyone who passes the federal Matura is allowed to enter (not succeed though! ;)) any Swiss university. US top universities have that whole admission process that weeds out tons of unsuited candidates. ETH can not do that. So that's where some of those failure rates come from.

The second thing you should be aware is that Swiss universities usually require more self discipline than the US counterparts. For example, at ETH there is one single test that covers the first two semesters. During the year, you are encouraged, but usually in no way forced to turn in any assignments. No midterms, no nothing. One test per course at the end of Summer and that's it. If you have the discipline to constantly work during the year, you will be absolutely fine!

Edit:

&gt; I am looking at the social sciences and not technology

ETH is for technology related studies (Maths, CS, Physics, etc.) or more generally for a Bachelor / Master of Science degree. I don't think ETH has any Master of Arts degrees? For social science, you need to look at universities of Zurich, Bern, Lucerne, Lausanne, etc.

The Swiss constitution states that Switzerland needs to maintain a standing MILITA army. The only authority who can change that are the voters. The question wether to have an army or not was put to the voters several times in the last 25 years. The people not only wanted to keep the army but they also approved of it with greater majority each time. This is very unlikely to change in the near future.

.

Milita / Professional forces

Since the end of the Cold War almost all european armies switched from a milita model with a professional core to much smaller professionals-only forces. 

These armies are not designed to defend the nation against an invading force but with foreign theaters outside Europe in mind. This can be a ""classical"" intervention like France did recently in Mali or a long term peacekeeping/policing mission like Operation Atalanta against piracy in the Indian ocean or a messy mix of both like in Afghanistan. 
 
What possible role can Switzerland play? Not much, really. Even in the KFOR mission in Kosovo Switzerland play a very minor role. Switzerland does not lack the money or the manpower but the political will. 

For the SVP/UDC even the KFOR participation goes too far, the moderate parties don't want to be the ones who send young men into war zones and the left, favor humanitarian aid workers to men with guns anyway.


.

Conclusion

Unless the voters change the constitution (unlikely) Switzerland has to keep an army, running some sort of outdated militia system. It will be of no practical use because for political reasons this army will not be present on the international stage in significant numbers.

In essence, Switzerland has an army because it wants one but this army does not do anything useful because Switzerland does not want it to. Direct democracy wins again!

Is it more of a collective law, or where does it say power is granted to the states before the bund? (Excuse me if i am not properly using that term correct)

true,DeepDuh,zh,Zürich,"See, I'm not even sure whether the things that usually occur in Switzerland can be called 'Racism'. The ones who're openly racist is a group called the 'Neo Nazis', consisting of a few hundred members in all of Switzerland - I've honestly never even met one in person. The 'usual' conservatives here that you'd meet often on the countryside are rather 'xenophobic' than racist, as others here have described it. The difference is, they don't really see people of other cultures as less human than themselves, they would just like to keep them being a minority, rather than becoming the minority themselves. So they often can't accept other cultures as being the 'same' as them, yet they don't see them as being worth less. You understand what I mean? It's very similar to the situation in most other countries with a somewhat homogenic culture that has formed over several centuries - which is true for most European regions. 

To make an example: Let's say you happen to get lost in the most isolated village somewhere in the mountains. People there will most probably be nice to you (usually a bit quirky though), but they treat you about the same as any other of those 'foreigners from Zurich' - including actual Swiss citizens from Zurich. Heck, people from Valais even call Swiss from outside of Valais 'outer-Swiss', which means about the same as 'foreigner'.
