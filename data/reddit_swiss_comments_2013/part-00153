Source:  did an MBA in France, did a lot of research before, Swiss national, worked internationally, lots of experience with the topic.

St. Gallen has an OK reputation - but in Switzerland.  It is barely known outside.  There are 3 reasons to get an MBA: some stuff you learn (which any halfway bright person could pick up on their own), the network (which you won't get that much of, especially if you want to work outside of Switzerland at some point) and the Big Important Name (tm) - the most important factor, IMHO.

If you can't get into a school with a Big, Important Name (tm), which usually costs a lot of money, do not bother with an MBA.  Seriously, take my advice on this.  There are plenty of forums where you can figure out the material they teach on your own, and plenty of online collaboration with others in a similar situation as yours.  Especially with your consulting background, you will be a massive step ahead of the game as you'll already have mastered all the banal tools; most of the McKinsey and BCG guys in my program considered it as a holiday.

Seriously - to work in Switzerland, rather focus your efforts on professional qualifications or something directly relevant to the field you want to work in.  German helps but is not strictly vital - but be aware that as a non-EU citizen without language skills you are at a huge disadvantage, no matter your experience.  Especially given that, you _really_ want to consider a degree that has serious international recognition, and yes, this means going down some of the top-10 lists (Business Weekly, Economist, Fortune, FT) and drawing your own conclusions.  

...If indeed you want to do it at all.  I just checked the FT rankings, and HSG is puttering around at #82 - their cost of living estimates are wildly hilarious.  Do you really want to pay 63k CHF for this in tuition alone?

Happy to answer any more specific questions.

_Edit:_ purely personal, anecdotal evidence, but I have not made very good experiences with HSG undergraduates - where I'm from, the program has a (at least partially) justified reputation as being a dumping ground for kids from rich families who couldn't hack a real academic program elsewhere - but that says little about the business school.",0,1375032202,null,0,1375032736,0,cbc1848,t3_1j65mp,t1_cbc1848,t3_1j65mp,null,1430263583,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
