For the duration of your time in the service (including your long period in the equivelant of the active reserves), you keep your Sig550 rifle or sig handgun (if you're an officer) at home.  It is a fully automatic rifle.  When you time in the military is done, you have a choice.  You can give you rifle back, or have it converted to semi-auto only and sold back to you at extremely minimal cost.  

It is important to note that these rifles are kept in the home for national defense.  Not home defense, not personal defense.  These are essentially foreign concepts in Switzerland.  You are required to keep all firearms in a locked safe seperate from their ammunition.  So the idea of using it in a B&amp;E situation is pretty impractical.  

Furthermore, despite the perception that Switzerland is some kind of firearms utopia, I should note that it is unlawful to have your guns anywhere other than your safe, unless you are on your way directly to or from the barracks or a shooting range.  Furthermore, while shooting ranges are sprinkled all over the country with a very high density, many will not allow any weapons except those used (presently or historically) by the Swiss military.  Finding a shooting range where you can take whatever hardware you like is a real challenge.

true,DeepBlueNemesis,bs,Beide Basel,"I can clear this up, but the answer is ""It depends on the case"".

If you legally bought the ammunition in a store (which you can) you won't get into trouble for owning ammunition. However if you illegally owned that ammo (say, you took it with you from a shooting range or from your military service) you will get a hefty fine and a suspended sentence (probably an even heftier fine, a jail sentence is unlikely).

Switzerland's law is pretty much the opposite of ""stand your ground"". If you can move away to prevent the situation from escalating you **absolutely have to**. Of course if the criminal is threatening your life or the life of someone else you can take action as a part of self defence, but you always have to keep it in perspective. For example, when a guy is holding a knife and you shoot him you will go to jail because your retaliation was out of proportion. If he's throwing his knife at you you still can't shoot him because unless you're battling in a knife factory he's unarmed now - you absolutely cannot shoot an unarmed man. Even if he's running away now you can't shoot him in the leg - again, you can't just shoot robbers (their crime isn't remotely seroius enough to justify the use of firearms that could potentially kill them). 

So when can you actually shoot them? If he's using firearms himself (against you or others) or he's rushing at you to slice you up. So basically unless he's really threatening your life (not just verbally!) or the life of someone else and you have no way to resolve the situation otherwise (i.e. retreat to a different place) you can shoot, but whenever possible you have to avoid killing him.

Since I don't go the army in Switzerland and wanted to shoot for fun I decided to apply for a gun permit, it was pretty easy to get it and you can easily buy most semi-automatic rifles and handguns.

* First you must have a clean criminal record.
* You must have a permit to live in Switzerland.
* You have to go to the local police station in order to request the papers in order to apply for the gun permit (you can buy a max of 3 guns per permit and you can apply for as many permits as you want).
* After filling those papers and having a background check you receive your weapons permit.
* Go to a store and buy the 3 guns you want and all the ammo you want.
* Secure those guns at home inside a gun cabinet or safe.

To be honest it's pretty easy to buy a bolt action rifle in Switzerland or a hunting shotgun, these are considered ""Free Weapons"" since you can buy them with just a copy of your ID and criminal records background check.

You can shoot all kinds of weapons at private gun ranges that exist across Switzerland but they only allow the standard army rifles and pistols **(K31, K11, SIG510, SIG550, Glock 19/17, P226, P210, P220)** at the shooting clubs that are endorsed by the state in Switzerland, you can even buy cheaper ammo over there.

In terms of home defence, you are allowed to use guns in determined situations when your life is at risk. Just remember that if you kill someone that wasn't really a threat to your life you will be in a pretty bad situation.

Concealed carry is allowed in some situations, you have to apply for a permit to CCW and they only give it when you have a very, very good reason for it.
