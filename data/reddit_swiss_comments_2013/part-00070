It's really easy: Get your whole wedding group together, go to a very steep hill, then have everyone gather at the top of the hill. The groom needs to be dressed in only underpants (as can be seen in the picture). Then you, the bride, will let go of the Emmental cheese so it rolls down the hill. Everybody will have to try as hard as they can to catch the cheese. Usually - as the hills in Switzerland are pretty steep - nobody manages to catch the Emmental, which means that the groom gets to kiss the bride.

If anyone else manages to catch the Emmental, they may then kiss the bride (french kiss). All of this is documented [here](http://imgur.com/R6DUmp7).

* The best tradition we have is the interaction between the groom and the mother of the bride. When you walk up the altar it is expected that you say the old Swiss proverb ""Du hüre verdammte Schaffseckle"" and kiss the mother on the lips. This is a symbolic kiss that seals the marriage and will bring a good harvest.

* If someone introduces themself to you with a ""Gruezi"" and a hand shake, stare but make sure to smile, then turn 180 degrees. DO NO say anything, it is rude and considered too ambitious.

* Start eating as soon as your food gets to you. In Swiss culture it is rude to let your food get cold, begin eating even before the plate hits the table.

* Drink as soon as someone pours you wine, no hesitation. This tradition was due to back in medieval times, when a famished cow might drink your wine before you had the luxury.

* If someone at your tables attempts to ""proscht"" or cheers you, it is polite to stare and say ""Hau ab!"" loudly, which means good luck.

*Figg di!* is also a very popular reply.

Not part of the wedding itself, but also a Swiss tradition is the *Wegglidieb* where the groom and his best friends hijack the bride from the bachelorette night, and give her back to her parents. Back in the days it was some macho ritual to show the bride who's boss, and until today a man is looked at as a weakling if he doesn't steal the bride. It's great fun actually, the most important part is that the brides friends mustn't know where the bride is, and she can't be returned to the parents until dawn.

Also, Swiss people looking for long term lease will always have the priority on some intern. You're probably better off looking for a room (about CHF 700.- to CHF 1000.- / month).

true,mangecoeur,null,null,"Best bet is finding a room in a flat share, you almost certainly will not find a whole flat unless you have a lot of money. wgzimmer.ch and students.ch have some things (though probably those are better for german part). You can also look in neighboring france (Ferney and Annemasse) though whether you're allowed to live in france while working in switzerland depends on your residence and migration status.

Having a personal contact with a room is by far the best way to get a place. Ask anyone you might know, ask the people you are doing your internship for, ask anyone you might meet - getting a room through someone you know is about 1000% easier than flat hunting.
