You know, there are some private schools like Benedict and HSO, which you can visit if you can't find a appreniceship or if you want to learn something else. Sadly, I picked one of the smaller ones, which was considered to be a bad school. Some people told me, that this particular school does everything, so that no one fails the finals (not educational-wise of course). But yeah.... I acually had no other choice to begin this apprenticeship.

Sadly, many young people don't know what to do or to learn. Most of them will start the apprenticeship in the office, because it's the easiest job for them.

true,SamSample0815,sz,Schwyz,"Alright, in that case my advice is the following (also I have no specific experience doing that):
Since you get rejected once they see your CV, you could try to turn the process around.

1. Shower, Shave (assuming you're male), Dress Up, Smile (very important!!)
2. Go check out some places in person. You don't wanna walk into huge firms, try ""KMU""s near where you live.
3. Ask them for a job (probably internships work best here), maybe even check whether they have some open jobs beforehand. 
4. Be friendly at all time! You want something from them, not the other way round!
If you make a good first impression, chances are higher that they will look at your CV from another perspective.

Since it seems that you don't have many options left, I think it's worth giving it a shot.

Alright, first things first: Check you CV! Have it polished, it needs to be bloody professional. Many companies, like Kelly Services and the like offer a CV check. There are many ways to write a good CV and cover letter, but have it checked by someone who looks at these regularly.

My advice regarding that school - I did something similar years back, I had to explain similar things.. - make sure your CV says ""Successfully finished apprenticeship"" and ""Eidg. Fachausweis"" or whatever you have  and then names ""Ortega Bildungszentrum"" (but only secondary, not bold etc.). I had to explain that I took exactly the same damn final tests just like everyone else who didn't go to my school. You'll always meet people who question the validity of your certificate - either you convince them or move on to someone less ignorant.
