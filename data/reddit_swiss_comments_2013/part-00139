Many (most, from what I can tell) native German speakers that come here don't pick up the Swiss German even after years (their kids do, though). I think this has two main reasons:

1. Swiss German doesn't have set rules and the dialect is different even when you just go 30km in one direction. This makes it a pretty hard language to systematically learn. The only way to know if you say something correctly is to ask someone who speaks it (and even then, it might not be entirely clear).

2. German speaking people are shy to speak (and hence train) Swiss German. Either because they know it will come out wrong (it's bound to in the beginning) or because they fear that Swiss German speaking people are going to judge them for them trying to 'fit in'. While I would have no problems with that, I feel like there are enough people who make this fear justified.

Most people do agree that the judges are actually implementing the law. However, when the public often does not feel that justice has been served, then either the judges systematically make too much use of the leeway the law gives them or the law itself is too soft. The law is here to represent the will of a society, not the other way around. It seems to me that this simple truth gets forgotten too often.

An action like this is aimed at destroying a person's family and social life as well as his career. Something like this may under no circumstances go unpunished. 400.- is not a punishment but practically renders the action legal. There needs to be *some* resemblance between the severity of the offence and the sentence.
