Swisscom has the best coverage but is the most expensive. Their plans have unlimited talk, SMS and data, but you pay for faster speeds.

Prices range from 59.-/month for 0.2Mbit down and 0.1Mbit up, to 169.-/month for 100Mbit down and 10Mbit up. The more expensive plans also include roaming.

There doesn't seem to be a way to share your data, but roaming isn't restricted.

**Orange**

Orange is known to have less good coverage but better prices. What is interesting, is that you can create a plan based on your needs, such as how many SMSs, how much data and how many minutes. Plans go from 10.-/month without included SMSs, data or minutes, to 140.-/month with unlimited calling and SMSs and 5GB data which you can share with your tablet.

Every extra SIM card is 20.- + 10.-/month.

Consider the annual pass for transport, its about 17% cheaper in Basel to buy annually instead of monthly.  SBB will exchange the unused months on your pass and apply it to a GA if you decide to get one.  If you do start making any trips to Zurich, etc get a Halbtax.  It pays for itself very quickly.  You can get a cheaper halbtax with an attached credit card, but that depends on which permit you get. (L permits aren't usually extended any credit, as far as I can tell.) 

http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/half-fare-travelcard.html

Include the monthly cost of your bank account.  PostFinance costs CHF 5/mo unless you hold over CHF 7500.  Get E-Finance so you can do everything online.

https://www.postfinance.ch/en/priv/prod/acc/chf/offer.html

You can save substantially on your mobile phone with a prepaid card, especially if you already have an unlocked GSM phone or don't mind pay for a phone up front.  Orange has a prepaid plan that is CHF 20/mo for data, and reasonable rates for international calling.

http://shop.orange.ch/en/prepay/icat/orange-world-prepay

Budget the costs for registration in the first month for your residence permit.  I paid CHF 284 for Ausweisgebühren and CHF 20 for Meldebstätigung ausl. Person.

Budget the deposit for your apartment.  It can be up to 3x rent here, no idea what the situation is in Basel.

Budget the cost of a wardrobe if you don't bring one.

If you can afford to move your furniture and its cheaper than repurchasing it (ie: it isn't Ikea) strongly consider doing so.

If your flat has a connection to UPC Cablecom a CHF ~30 connection fee is in your rent even if you don't use it (unless you ask for it to be disconnected).

You can get a free 2mbps cable modem connection and ~50 digital channels.

Swiss Rent	2000	Grossbasel is more expensive to live than Kleinbasel where I have my two rooms 56m^2 flat for 960.- a month

Food	1000	 Depends on what and how much you eat, if you go to restaurants or cook for yourself which is much cheaper, but sounds about right, shouldn't be much more.

Cable Internet + TV package	110	I pay 59.- at upc cablecom, also the basic tv stations are free if you have a digital decoder built into your tv, only buy the TV package if you feel like you need the additional stations.

Health Insurance	250	That's a pretty cheap insurance, but it should cover all basics. I pay 500.- for mine, maybe I should switch my Krankenkasse, I know it's the most expensive one there is.

Transport Pass	70  Is cheaper if bought for a whole year.
