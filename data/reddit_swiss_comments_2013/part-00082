Or the guy in Florida who shot up a car of people at a gas station because they got verbally violent.


Or the dude in Arizona who shot a guy walking his dog because the guy got upset the dude almost ran him over. The guy slammed his hands down on the hood and dude got out of the car and killed him.

You might be surprised to know, the stand your ground laws have a lot in common with Switzerland. If your experience with stand your ground is from nothing but sensationalist headlines upvoted on reddit, I can see why you might think they are opposite.

They still have to show that a reasonable person would be in fear for their life, which means the ability to show that the attacker had means, motivation, and opportunity. Brandishing a knife does not meet the criteria, rushing at you with one does.

&gt; you absolutely cannot shoot an unarmed man.

Pretty much the same, unless there are extenuating circumstances. If you are a 5'6"" 75 year old man and somebody who looks like the rock is threatening to kill you and rushes you, you can shoot them even though they were armed with nothing more than their fists, because they still had the means to kill you.

Just because he was plotting pre-meditated murder, does not mean that the law itself is at fault.
