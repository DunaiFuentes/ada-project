Not to say that the current army is sufficient to go toe to toe with any serious aggressor:  the goal of the swiss army has always been to make switzerland as unattractive a target as possible hoping that any war blows over before anyone gets interested in us.

* The army servies as a cultural mixing bowl that is fairly critical to the functioning of our democracy as it stands.

Can you explain why not? Almost every western country has switched back to a militia (i.e. conscription, draft) at least twice within the last one hundred years. Some more than that. 

&gt;In the quite likely event that a volunteer army is insufficient to protect switzerland

The fact is that conscript armies have been becoming less and less effective over the last 50 years. One hundred years ago, professional soldiers weren't really much better than conscripts given a couple of months of training. But today there is a world of difference, and a highly trained professional army will walk over a conscript army, just like the Americans walked over the Iraqis in 2003. 

I know a lot of Swiss guys who have come out of the army and now do their annual 3 weeks or whatever. And I also know a lot of guys who serve in volunteer armies in other countries. And there is a huge difference between them. Most of the Swiss guys treat it as a joke, while soldiers from other countries are absolute professionals who take their jobs very seriously. Many of them have survived ambushes in Afghanistan, while my Swiss colleagues treat their service like a holiday.

Professional armies are indeed more effective in modern combat conditions, but the army in Switzerland is not designed to be the dominant force in an asymetric scenario, as is the case in most engagements from the point of view of most western countries.  In a real war, Switzerland would be the weaker force and would need to use pseudo-guerrilla tactics.  Small professional teams are not as valuable in such scenarios as a large reserve of adequately trained militiamen.

And this sidesteps the social risks of a professional army: the further removed the army is from the populace, the greater the risk of political takeover.
