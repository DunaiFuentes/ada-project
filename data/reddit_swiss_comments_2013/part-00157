The HSG released a paper on the financing, and came - given the political background: not surprisingly - to the conclusion that neither, the IK's proposal nor other possible solutions would work out.

If they are not too far away from Basel, you probably have a good chance to find an internship or practicum in your field as most pharma companies are residing around Basel. I think asking the companies directly would be the most promising way to go about it. You can find some of them [here](http://www.baselarea.ch/en/working-in-the-basel-area/leading-companies/pharmaceuticals-biotechnology-and-life-sciences.html).

If you want to browse some jobs online, you could try [jobscout24](http://www.jobscout24.ch), [jobs.ch](http://www.jobs.ch) or maybe even [Xing](http://www.xing.com), which is more of a a business oriented socialmedia site, but I've found that it works well for industry specific job offers.
