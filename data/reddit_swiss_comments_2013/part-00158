Then a digressive tax via VAT isn't probably even legal or fair. I sometimes wonder what would happen if initiatives had to be a bit better thought out in financing the ideas and their legality. Goes for both, left and right submissions and ideas that I like or dislike. Sometimes I just facepalm when I see how little the proposal has been thought out. How should I have an opinion of something vague like that?

true,tangerinelion,null,null,"I wouldn't go so far as to say this is direct evidence.  The abstract summarizes it fairly well, 0.84 background and 2.2 signal events are expected.  Observed were two events.

The minimum for evidence of a process is 3 sigma, which with 0 background this would be 3 data events, just from Poisson statistics.  From that alone we know that 2 data events cannot be evidence of anything.

That all said, the process involved isn't forbidden by the SM but instead predicted by it.  It wouldn't at all be surprising to see it, but with 5/fb there's no shot.  We should wait for the next iteration with 20/fb as one would naively expect about 9 data events [x4 for data, x sqrt(8/7) for beam energy].  With 9 events and a background of around 4, there would be enough separation to make a meaningful statement about having direct evidence or not.
