The E version which is the version that Switzerland selected is under development with the first test aircraft under construction. Key technologies for Gripen E have been tested on the Gripen NG demonstrator, this include the new engine (GE F414) for increased thrust allowing super cruise, relocated landing gear allowing 40% more internal fuel, a new electronically scanned array radar with +-100 degrees field of view, infra red search and track, partitioned avionics separating tactical systems from flight critical ones, etc.

true,birra_80,null,null,"It might be the cheapest of the competition but that does not mean that it's crap, in the evaluation where the Gripen got the lowest score of the competing aircraft had the Gripens performance figures lowered to allow for risks as it is still under development.

All combat aircraft are the products of design choices and compromises.
Because of its size Gripen has a smaller combat radius that the F/A18 and Rafale. Also because of its smaller size it can not carry as much weapons.

In terms of kinematics Gripen has an edge on the F/A18 with a significantly higher top speed, maximum g-load and slightly better thrust to weight ration. Compared to Rafale the figures are similar, but Gripen has a lower wing loading than the other two.

All three use Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars, interestingly despite its smaller size Gripens radar has a slightly larger diameter than Rafals 0.6m versus 0.55 i think, this should translate to slightly better detection ranges but this is something we can not know for sure as other factors come into play as well.

Both Gripen E and Rafale have integrated infrared search and track allowing passive detection of air and ground targets.

There simply is no ""best"" aircraft only aircraft best suited and for Switzerland Gripens lower acquisition and operating costs (allowing for more aircraft and more flying time for the pilots) were most likely more important than the better range and payload of the Rafale.",0,1379361182,null,0,false,0,cc9mfvi,t3_1mblz1,t1_cc9mfvi,t1_cc7wruq,null,1429441798,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
