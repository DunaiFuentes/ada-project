true,itsme101,null,null,"The notion is that a universal income will simply take the place of current bureaucratically controlled welfare systems. Basically, you provide the financial aid that low (or no) income are already receiving, but you do so in a free market manner. 

In terms of losing incentive to work, I don't think a universal income would change the way society currently responds to capitalistic incentives. The same people that live off of public welfare (drug addicts, convicts, single parents with kids, etc.) that either can't or won't work will remain in that state, the only difference being that they'll receive funds on a lump sum basis. If they choose to invest said funds, they may get healthy returns and slowly accumulate wealth. If they choose to spend quickly on vices, they will remain poor and dependent on the state-provided income source. 

I personally think it is the most efficient form of public welfare. Just give the people the funds and let them do what they will. The market will dictate the rest. ",0,1384630697,null,0,false,0,cdftswr,t3_1qrkdc,t1_cdftswr,t1_cdfqig7,null,1428634360,10,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,10
