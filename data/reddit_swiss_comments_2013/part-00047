What I really like about them is that you get your results very quickly and that they are really professional. I just know the process with HIV testing, but I think that applies also to other things as well. Not sure about the price, though. A HIV test costs around 70.- there, depending on how long you want to wait for the results.

Maybe this helps, too?
