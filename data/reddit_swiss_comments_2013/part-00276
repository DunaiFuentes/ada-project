Of course I wouldn't stay at a hotel near the airport since it's in the suburbs. If I would stay in a hotel in Zurich, I would choose one in Kreis 1. That's the most central part of Zurich where also the old town is located. Just make sure you don't stay at Niederdorfstrasse – people party there on weekends, it can get noisy.

Lucerne is not a big town and most of its sights are close together (almost as soon as you exit the train station you are in front of famous Kappellbrücke, you cross the river, you are already in the old town, another 10 minute's walk brings you to the Lion Monument). So one day should be enough. If you are an efficient sightseer, get up early, don't mind coming back to Zurich late, you may even be able to squeeze in a short trip to Mt. Rigi or Mt. Pilatus!

It will cost you some money, but it is worth the trip as you get a nice panoramic view of central Switzerland and the alps. In case it is a foggy day, tage the ""mountain rail"" from Vitznau to Mount Rigi. Chances are high you get above the fog and enjoy the sun and mountain view. :-)
