Since you are interested in design I would advise you to make sure you travel to different parts of the country. You probably know that we have four different languages. Visit those regions – they have a different architecture, different visual styles, a different culture. This will be very rewarding.

There are two exhibitions you shouldn't miss: [Excellent Swiss Design](http://www.designnet.ch/index.php?pageID=360&amp;lng=en) in Langenthal and [The Best of 2013 in Architecture, Landscape and Design](http://www.museum-gestaltung.ch/en/exhibitions/coming-soon/) in Zurich. The later is quite small, there will be just a few but exceptional objects. But visit it before January 5 and you can also enjoy the excellent Martin Parr exhibition at the same place!

[Vitra Design Museum](http://www.design-museum.de/en/information.html) is a must! It's located in Germany, but right at the Swiss border. In Basel you can take a local bus and be there in 20 minutes. Another important Museum for you would be the [Textile Museum](http://www.textilmuseum.ch) in St. Gallen. 

If you are into photography check out the [Musée de l'Elisée](http://www.elysee.ch/en/homepage/) in Lausanne (they have a Sebastião Salgado exhibition!) and the [Photomuseum Winterthur](http://www.fotomuseum.ch/index.php?id=501&amp;L=1). 

Living in Zurich I find the urban development interesting. If you're into that stuff, then [check this out ](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/hbd/de/index/entwicklungsgebiete/zuerich_west.secure.html)(in the left menu: ""Zürich-West"" and ""Neu-Oerlikon"". Sorry, only in German).
But this might be the better site for you: [Kreislauf 4+5](http://www.kreislauf4und5.ch/en/index.html). It presents some of the coolest shops around the notorious Langstrasse in Zürich.  One of my favorite places (and a must see) is the [Freitag Store](http://www.freitag.ch/media/stores/zurich).

WHAT? NO. What are you talking about? The far right HATES immigrants. 

As for egalitarian vs authoritarian, I don't tend to believe that either. After the collapse of the soviet union, there was a brief period where there was almost no such thing as socialism. It's making its way back though, socialist parties have emerged as primary parties in elections and have won a large amount of leadership positions. Even in the US, the left is starting to appear more socialist.
I don't agree with socialist policies, but this is beyond the whole socialism =  evil thing, which was part of the cold war.
And I especially don't think what the Republican viewpoint represents is egalitarianism. I think that's a misunderstanding of the party and what it represents as whole. I won't even try to explain this.

Why does it matter what I affiliate myself as. 
I don't think saying I am a republican or democrat matters here.

Learn your English words, man. It's hard to have a conversation with someone who thinks key words mean the opposite of what they mean. I don't really buy in to your definitions of any of these other words now either, especially the contentious political ones. Goodbye.

This sentence: CNN victimized immigrants.
This sentence means CNN made immigrants into the victim: i.e. the subject of abuse, a sympathetic figure, not the abuser. It's associated with innocence.
This does not mean CNN took a shovel and hit the immigrant on the head.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You're having trouble with word association, which is common in people who speak English as a second language. Every language has them.

While you are correct, it would be clear to a native English speaker.

The correct usage of the first definition you gave would be the following:

1) Sally slept with Jenny's Girlfriend. Jenny is angry and states she was victimized by Sally. She is the subject of abuse, and is the VICTIM. 

This has a subconscious association that Jenny is innocent. She has done nothing wrong. She does not deserve what was done to her. Whether or not Jenny is innocent, has done nothing wrong, or doesn't deserve this is unknown the the listener. This is the meaning you were confused with. If I wanted to say CNN treats immigrants as if they are the plague, I would say ""CNN attacks immigrants"" -- it is in the active voice, and is clear.

2) If Sally slept with Jenny's boyfriend, and Jenny is talking to one of Sally's friends who is defending Sally by saying it is not her fault.
Jenny can say ""Stop victimizing Sally""
This means that Sally's friend is intending the make Sally look like the victim: someone innocent, etc.

Lastly, you're not making any sense: just stop. I was NOT discussing anything about politics last post, I was commenting on the use of the English Language.
