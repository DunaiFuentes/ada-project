true,Motzlord,tg,Thurgau,"As with any language, if you're actually trying, Swiss German is not that hard. (Trust me, I'm learning Finnish at the moment). For example, you only have one past tense etc. And nobody expects you to understand the weirdest of dialects.
Of course, if you already know a Germanic language, it's going to be much easier, but it's not undoable.
There are also language courses for it, so if you're not getting enough practice or feel like you're off to a bad start, try it. The city of Zurich for example offers Züridütsch courses. Migros Klubschule might have them as well. Or get a friend to teach you. Just make sure you immerse in the language and don't have everybody switch to English or whatever when you're around. *Immersion is key.*

As for most Germans in Switzerland: The reason why a large percentage of them never really learn Swiss German is because 1) they don't need to and b) some of them think it's a farmer's language and not worth learning.

Generally, I'd advise learning it if you are looking for work in ""low-level"" jobs, e.g. jobs with a lot of customer interaction or you just want to fit in more. Swiss people appreciate you trying to learn/speak Swiss German. If you speak High German, that's good enough but *you need to be able to understand Swiss German*. Not everybody will switch to High German and personally, I think it's a bit rude if you live here and don't understand it (I mean of course it takes some time). Now don't get me wrong, I switch languages immediately when I realize somebody doesn't get me (And I'm fluent in 4 languages) but sometimes you have to force people a little as well. ;)",0,1385724655,null,0,false,0,cdpiqj9,t3_1rniq0,t1_cdpiqj9,t3_1rniq0,null,1428465145,8,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,8

Since Switzerland is so multi cultural anyway (hell even our chocolate bars have 3-4 languages on it), just be yourself and talk what ever suits you best. With younger people, English would be no problem, as for any official conversation, just try to learn German / French or Italian, depending on what reagion you are lifing. 

I noticed that about 8 years ago, if someone would start talking with me in ""high"" German, I would imedatly switch to ""high"" German too.

true,ElucTheG33K,vd,Vaud,"Hi !
I was at Lausanne when I was at University, I also know a few about Zurich.

For your car, you should be able to drive it with Norway plate and insurance. I know some expat driving English cars (with UK plate) in Switzerland for years now.

For skiing I would recommend Lausanne, you can go to Valais within 60-90min by car and there is a lot of huge ski resort:
Verbier, Diableret (with Glacier open very early in the winter), Portes du soleil (connection between France and Switzerland !), Gsaad, Cran Montana, ....
There should be ski resorts not so far from Zurich too but I don't know them, there are less famous (doesn't mean there are not good).

School: UNIL (HEC is part of UNIL, University of Lausanne): it's located outside the city center, however it's like 10-15min by metro (not a real metro, it's not underground but we call it so). The campus groups UNIL and EPFL (Swiss Technological Institute, a Federal University too for technical studies and research) so you have a lot of students gather in a same place. That means student associations of all kind and parties of courses !

About Nightlife: both have a lot of nice venues to go out but Zurich has a point with to free closing time (some club close at 11am !), in opposition Lausanne has a strict policy, bars close at 2am, clubs at 5am. If you like underground electronic music maybe there is more in Zurich but you have some in Lausanne too. Zurich has the biggest outdoor party every summer, the Street Parade, right in the street of Zurich on the lake side, but anyway you can take a train from Lausanne and go to Zurich in 2h for this special event.

About the city: Lausanne is hard to find a flat or a student room but Zurich could be even harder. And prices are like crazy on both side. Check for the accommodation service of the university to get links and sign up as early as possible for a student room around the campus. Other wise both city are great place to live and hang around, there is a lot of shops, cinemas (with sometimes the original version) and both have a nice lake. Zurich is much bigger however Lausanne has maybe nicer area arround the lake to walk, run, do roller blade, do BBQ with friend, ... (you can walk to the lake within 10 minutes from the UNIL).
Anyway Switzerland is not so big, by train you can ride from Lausanne to Zurich in 2h and in the middle you have Bern. Geneva is 35min from Lausanne with the non-stop train. It's slightly longer by car but cheaper (not counting parkings). By the way, if you live to close from the campus you'll not get the right to buy a parking card, be sure you can park your car next to your student accommodation.
Ask me if you have more question about Lausanne. Maybe wait for someone from Zurich to give its point of view.",0,1385728401,null,0,false,0,cdpj7dx,t3_1rp4a1,t1_cdpj7dx,t3_1rp4a1,null,1428464926,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

In the morning we usually take a train back to the main station (~10 CHF)

Be careful a taxi will cost you a lot of money. I think ~7 CHF for sitting in the taxi and every KM is about 5 CHF.
A 5 minute taxidrive costs about 20 CHF. I usually don't take the taxi.
