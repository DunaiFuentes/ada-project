true,Skinnj,zg,Zug,"&gt;Do you think Lucerne is big enough that I could just wander all day and find a few things to do? (if that makes sense)

In the first few days (or maybe weeks), yes.

But it's not that big a city after all, if you get bored (which probably wont be the case) there are several other cities or villages nearby that offer activities and are easily reachable by public transportation. 
The public transportation is quite expensive, if you plan on travel throught the country by train I'd recommend you to purchase a ['Halbtax'](http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/half-fare-travelcard.html)

The hiking trails are marked everywhere and there are some great apps you can use to navigate, like http://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/free-switzerlandmobility-app.html . Then, of course, skiing (March is still pretty much in the skiing season); all the famous ski resorts: Zermatt, Gstaad, Engelberg, Saas Fee, Grindelwald, Laax, Davos, etc. are all just really close. For the must-see things in Switzerland, you can get a pretty good idea from the website of Switzerland Tourism. I'm not trying to offend you by calling you a tourist, but why not look at a compilation of all sights that there are to see. Myswitzerland.com

My favourite places for going out in Lucerne:

Bar 59

Schüür

ROK

Parterre

Capitol Bar

Bourbaki(MUST SEE the bar is a revolving platform)

Jazzkantine

Sedel



My favourite places for going out in Zurich:

Lucy's Bar in the Niederdorf

Gonzo

Zukunft (Langstrasse in general)

Plaza

Café Schnaps

2.

See the Löwengraben, the glacier museum, the museum of transport, the church of the jesuits, the Nature museum and just wander through the old town... nothing can happen there.

3. Keep your belongings very close to you especially at the train stations in Switzerland since there are alot of pickpockets. Also Stay clear of any shady people which are easily distinguishable from the usual population.

4. You'll probably get some from your host family. If not, go to the Ikea or the Globus to get some sheets.
