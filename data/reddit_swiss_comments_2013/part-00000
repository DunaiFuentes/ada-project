true,rioso,null,null,"I live in Switzerland and it appears very strange to me that we are called Gun-loving Swiss. This article is just not well investigated.
1. The authorities give the permission to carry a gun in public only, when you can explain, why you need to carry a gun. I don't know any person that has a permit nor a person that has a private gun (except hunters).
2. You can transport a gun (Hunters on their way to the woods or going to the shooting range).
3. As the article says, it is not allowed to take ammunition from the army or the shooting range, when you go for your mandatory exercise. So when somebody carries an army gun, it is never loaded.
4. Leibacher (who shot 14 people from the parliament) didn't use his army gun in the shooting, he was never in the army.
5. If you don't want to keep your army gun at home, you can leave it at the arsenals.

It upsets me that Switzerland is used as an good example that gun owning works. It's true, we have a different approach to guns, nobody cares about guns except a few people doing it as a sport or hunters. Nobody uses guns to defend himself or his property.

* Chocolate factory: Maison Cailler in Broc
* Mountains: in addition to Eiger (and Mönch and Jungfrau - these 3 are next to each other), Matterhorn, you should consider Moleson, Pilatus, Rigi, and Schilthorn (where a 007 was filmed)
* Swim: I can only personally recommend floating in the river Aare (as I live here). On a very nice day you can have thousands of people float down the river. The baths in the city are, best of all, FREE! Here's a cool video from the BBC: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10893835 For actual swimming, I heard ones around Lakes Luzern, Zürich, and Geneva are very nice.
* Mürren/Lauterbrunnen: Both amazingly beautiful. I go to the two at least twice a year. Honestly, every mountain range is beautiful. It depends where you are and what your schedule is like. If you are more in the French region, you can check out Gstaad or the Wallis valley. In the central region, there is the Bernese Oberland (where Mürren/Lauterbrunnen is, but also Grindelwald, Löschberg and Gurnigel [I was actually there this morning for snowboarding and it is magnificently gorgeous]. In the east, you have the canton of Graubrunden where it's mostly mountainous nature.
