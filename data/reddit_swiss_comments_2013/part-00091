Schools are a matter of the cantons, but the political opinion is that you should learn another Swiss national language in school besides just English.

The native language (in my case German) is usually taught from grade 1 to grade 9. The Swiss dialect was often used orally, but standard German is used to write/read.
French was studied in 5th grade-9th grade.

After the 6th grade the students were separated into 2 different tiers.
French and German were taught in both, but English was mandatory in the higher tier and optional in the lower tier.

The higher tier had Italian and Latin as optional languages (I chose Italian), not sure whether the lower tier had any other options beside English though.

After 9th grade mandatory school ends. The students in the higher tier are allowed to apply for high school and will be either accepted based on their grades or after an entrance exam. I had to study German/French/English throughout high school for 3 years.

 There's an option to choose Russian, Spanish, Greek or Latin as a core subject, or Latin/Spanish/Japanese/Italian as optional subjects, the variety probably depends on the teachers that are employed. 
There also was an option to drop English as a mandatory subject for Latin or Italian.


The people that didn't get into high school either choose to learn a trade with or without additional education, where French, English and German are mandatory. There's also the possibility to go for further education with a 10th grade education or a business school.

(2) yes, i grew up in the canton of Zurich.

(3). German (grade 1-12), French (grade 5-12), English (grade 8-12), Latin (grade 7-12), Spanish and Italian for 1 year each (both as mandatory courses).

(4)  Like others have mentioned, education is up to the cantons. But it also depends on the kind of secondary school you attend (Sekundarschule A/B/C or Gymnasium). In Gymnasium you can choose to focus on modern or ancient languages (or on other things), and some schools even offer a bilingual path (English/German or French/German). I'd say these days it's definitely expected of young people to speak English, and you're at an advantage if you can speak an additional language. I feel like the national languages are becoming less important though - at least in the German part of Switzerland.
