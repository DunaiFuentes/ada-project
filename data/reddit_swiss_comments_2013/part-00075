In short: She can apply online (http://www.phbern.ch/studium/zulassung-und-anmeldung/anmeldung/onlineanmeldung.html) and will also have to send in some documents (high school diploma, bachelor diploma...). 
The university will then decide if she meets the conditions for admission. Depending on her educational background she might have to take an entrance exam. 
More info on that here: http://www.phbern.ch/studium/zulassung-und-anmeldung/aufnahmepruefung.html

Edit: That said, proficiency in German is rather important for any kind of teaching position.

Possibly.  I don't know enough about international law and the extradition process.  Is there a minimum BAC level in Switzerland to determine if someone is driving under the influence?

Absolutely not!!!  Always stop in the event of an accident here.  I haven't heard of any scams here the way they happen in Russia (I'm sure they happen, few and far between), but leaving the scene of an accident is a felony (very serious crime) depending on the state, in Arizona:

&gt;*If the accident involved serious physical injury or death, and the defendant caused the accident, then this can be charged as a class two (2) felony. In addition to having your license revoked for five (5) years, you can be sentenced to the following punishment: probation with zero (0) days in jail up to one (1) year in jail, or prison range of three (3) years to 12 and one half (12.5) years of incarceration.*

That's for a first time offender, which I assume she is. ",0,1366324930,null,0,false,0,c9i1iuv,t3_1cl6yx,t1_c9i1iuv,t1_c9i14sa,null,1431508461,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
