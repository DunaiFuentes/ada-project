Obviously it usually doesn't work that way, so many take up illegal activity, since it's the only thing they can do here.

I ran into some of these individuals myself and they began to surround me before someone who lived there came and pulled me away.  (Note:  they were drunk at 7 pm, so it seems like it is a general problem).  

I was at the camp with a friend of mine and he needed to use the bathroom, so he goes to take a look and came back immediately.  He said that it was by far the worst bathroom he had ever seen - piss everywhere, soaking wet, toilets were glorified holes in the ground, toilets had no seats - it was a very jarring sight for someone to see in the richest country (Keep in mind: the institution has two wings and there is one bathroom for each wing, so about 25 rooms per wing = 40 people (Couples and families are put in single rooms) on each wing share one bathroom.

true,DeepDuh,zh,Zürich,"- I didn't really talk about the asylum centers but the whole system.

- To extend on my point: To do this consequently you'd have to make the conditions in those centers stricter - no going in and out, since the inhabitants don't have a permit to be in the country yet. This way it would become much easier to deny illegal activities in there.

- At the same time, obviously, the process for approval / denial should become more efficient, since it isn't tolerable to imprison asylum seekers, including their children, for long.

So what I'd advocate for is to fully integrate asylum holders while at the same time stopping this laisser faire attitude we have towards asylum centers. These centers are not only damaging for the people in there, but also for the Swiss people's opinion on asylum seekers - it spawns anger or even racism.
