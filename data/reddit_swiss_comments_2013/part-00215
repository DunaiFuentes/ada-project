There are none of those in the States, so why not?
Also, since those are often on a hill, the view is great.
My favourites:
Schloss Lenzburg, Lenzburg, (Aargau)
Habsburg in Habsburg, Aargau (There's a restaurant in the castle, sadly closed until spring 2014)
Wildegg AG
The three castles in Bellinzona, Ticino

With this temperatures, I suggest going to a hot spring or water park with some friends.
Water slides: Alpamare, Pfäffikon SZ (Bonus: It's located close to a beautiful lake)
Hot springs: 
Aquarena, Schinznach AG
Aqua Basilea (never went, but it's in Basel)
Sole Uno, Rheinfelden BS

Taking boat on lakes is also nice. Especially in Lucerne. You can first take the boat from across the train station, then go up the Rigi mountain.

Well, here are some of my favorite awesome places in my lovely country.

- melchseefrutt, 2500m high surrounded by mountains, go during the night and a clear sky, you have never seen so many stars.

- walk from the stanserhorn to the wirtzweli, takes about 4 hours, you'll see most of the mountains, you can pet the cows on the way and enjoy some mountain milk.

- Check out the old city of lucerne, really worth having a look 

- The Rheinfalls in Schaffhausen are very impressive, you might wanna check that out

- The nicest bigger city on west-switzerland is probably lausanne, simply beatiful place, but it's quite steep 

- grab yo skies bro and drive to GR (laax/celerina)",0,1381708354,null,0,false,0,ccr3r2i,t3_1ocmk1,t1_ccr3r2i,t3_1ocmk1,null,1429141665,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4

true,Progale1,vd,Vaud,"I highly recommend going to Gruyères. It's a small town in Fribourg (in the french speaking part of switzerland), there you could visit the cheese and chocolate factory, i know its very touristic, but it's actually quite fun. And while you're there, you should go and have lunch in one of the restaurents in the actual town. Go for something traditional, I promise you the food will be excellent. There also happens to be  a castle there that you can visit. But one of the lesser known things , is that there is an Alien museum there, because the guy who invented and drew the aliens from the movies was swiss, and he came from gruyères. Although do keep in mind that the museum is extremely disturbing, so I wouldn't recommend visiting it if you don't like being grossed-out. On the other side of the museum there is a sort of pub, and the interior design is purposfully reminiscent of the aliens. For example, the seats look like they are made of spines and ribs. I would recommend having a drink there after having gone to the museum, just for the fun of it. If I were you, I would just go spend a day or two in gruyères, and maybe, if you have the time, go to geneva lake, plenty of stuff to do there.
