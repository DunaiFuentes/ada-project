Not really. Nothing is free, even in your Belgium. Don't forget that in Belgium you have to pay up to 50% taxes. Now let's imagine you have a family of two with CHF 50k yearly income (not very rich). You will pay about CHF 1500 of taxes + about CHF 5000 of insurance - about CHF 3000 state subsides = CHF 3500. If you spend more than your CHF 1500 co-pay (i.e. chf 3000 both) you will pay a grand total of CHF 6500 for your familly in both taxes, insurance and medical fees.

Now in Belgium you will pay 45% of taxes, i.e. CHF 22500. Even if you have some deductions from that it will still be much more expensive.

I don't like the military to be compulsory and I'm sure many people who didn't vote yes, also don't like it.

Now since nothing will change because Maurer thinks he's supported, you can only undermine the military one on one. Try to get off early, do civil service (even if you started the military you can always switch) etc.

true,airaqua,zg,Zug,"Well, why should all women be threatened to do that anyway? It's not even the case for all men these days. Therefore, not really an argument. I'm for an equal treatment of military and civil duty where one can freely choose from. Moreover, O know some women who have done their military duty and they didn't get treated differently (except for the hair). I would say that they had it sometimes even more difficult than others to prove themselves in front of their male colleagues. 
I don't think that there is much room to complain, especially when so man men become ""untauglich"". As I said, I'm in favour of a general service for all people which should be of equal worth. 
But it should be clear that men and women can't be equally treated in all issues since it's a fact that they work differently.
PS: pfff, and waht about salaries? Women do not have any advantages there either. We still get less paid since companies fear losses because of ""Mutterschaftsurlaub"" and ""Teilzeitarbeit"". There hasn't much changed either. Men don't fight for their equal rights and women are the one that loose and have to stay at home and/or work for a shitty salary. I would like to see men handle that. Military service is nothing in comparison ;)",0,1379914387,null,0,false,0,ccdnex9,t3_1mw9kr,t1_ccdnex9,t1_ccdhc3r,null,1429372945,-4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,-4
true,airaqua,zg,Zug,"Yeah, we ALWAYS get special treatments, right. I'm someone that hates such things. 
But still I see especially one area where this is not the case: namely in many companies. Women get treated differently for doing the same things as men but in a rather negative way. They don't have the same salary and since there is not much talk about money in Switzerland, it's not very obvious.

Why do men not fight there for equal treatment? Why don't you fight for ""Vaterschaftsurlaub"" and ""Teilzeitarbeit""? Why not? If everyone would have the same possibilities in this area, it wouldn't automatically be clear who stays at home or who will get the smaller wage. Yes, men would maybe get a little bit less, but women would be finally on the same level as men and really share the responabilities with men.

What is talked about instead: endless sayings about military service. I really wonder how many men really had the hard core military service... I see the issue and I gave my opinion on it. However, there are other areas where we have to fight our battle. Special treatment.... Yeah right.

true,ALTSuzzxingcoh,be,73% sexist - 100% swiss (Bern),"Look, I'm sorry this post has to have this angry tone, but yours' second half is exactly what I mean. Where exactly do you get the audacity from to downplay mens' discrimination with ""arguments"" like women salaries? Do you realize that while probably often difficult to follow through with, your *right* to an equal salary is written in the law, anchored by the equality article in the constitution, while a few sentences above or beneath it, my *obligation* to serve is laid down, a few seconds after ""Discrimination based on sex, age, religion (...) is forbidden""?
Where does anybody get the nerve to compare legal obligation, in spite of supposed constitutional equality, to legal right, based on the same constitutional article?

It's also noteworthy that you wrote that the sexes couldn't be treated equally everywhere ""because they work differently"". Ok, let's be honest here, the only case where this would be applicable would - again - be military service, where faux feminists would argue, as you did, that due to motherhood and general body strength and past discrimination, women couldn't be hold to the same obligation. So, in essence, everyone who says this has made their own argument factproof and circular.

You started by saying that the whole thing isn't really the law any more, anyway. Yes? Would you please tell that to incarcerated men whose only crime was having a penis and not serving, to those disabled men that have to pay +3% in taxes, and to those thousands currently being recruited? You've basically said that the entire point of argument, the discrimination I've brought up, conscription, is ""not really an argument"". Well, what's this thread for then?

By the way, I like having my hair long. I'm not really into the state getting to dictate my hairstyle for what would be, in actuality, more than 10 years of my life. I'm sure it was nice when people were all the same back in the 50's, when wearing jeans was a thing for kids and they hit kids in schools, but I'd expect my right to bodily integrity to be respected, if nothing else. Imagine all the 19-yr-old women to have their hair cut short; now ask yourself why it's ok to ignore young men's own decisions about their appearance.

**edit**: In response to your other comment, how would you know that I'm not for a change in men's work models? I'd love for men to have elective or even compulsory paternal leave and for women to work while continually more and more fathers could spend time with their children. I know I enjoyed it when I was a kid, as much as I did when my mother was around. Why would you think, seeing how I think of this all as discrimination, that I wouldn't be in favor of that?",0,1379916396,null,0,1379916983,0,ccdnuq3,t3_1mw9kr,t1_ccdnuq3,t1_ccdnex9,null,1429372740,9,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,9
