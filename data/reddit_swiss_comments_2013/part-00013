A couple of suggestions: 

Don't use images for text. If you really want use images for text, don't save them as a JPGs, use PNGs instead, the quality degradation with JPG is horrible, also don't forget to add an ALT attribute to your images, because it will help search bots with indexing your content. But seriously, you don't want to use images for text. From accessibility to search engine ranking to optimizing for various displays / mobile there are numerous reasons why this is a thoroughly bad idea.

As an example, there's virtually no reason to use an image at the right side (""Our Nappies"") except fortime constraints / laziness. Use a styled un-ordered list for that.

The same can be said for your pricing plans inside your slider, and many other elements.

About the slider, I have a feeling that the fade timing is too slow once you click a bullet point, especially since the slider cycles through the content itself, it's rather confusing.

The site is also slow at my end, I recommend using Google PageSpeed to optimize it.

In short: I find that you could really optimize the user experience with your site. Since this seems to be mainly an online company, there's really no excuse to be complacent in this regard.",0,1358693565,null,0,1358693816,0,c809ekm,t3_16m3gh,t1_c809ekm,t3_16m3gh,null,1431021446,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

I can't really help you with the academic aspect, but first off, the faculty of architecture of Lugano is not in Lugano, but in Mendrisio actually. If you knew that coming to Switzerland meant adapting to ""everything in smaller scale"", Lugano is not a rather eventful city. It sure has some interesting events during the summer, but aside from that, even by swiss standards, it's pretty slow. And Mendrisio is but a large village if compared to the average size of Swiss cities. However, the scenery and weather are within the best in the country.
My cousin did her Masters in Lugano, those classes were in english, but it was in Communication &amp; Media, her housemates did a Master in tourism, also in english. I believe most/all masters are in englis, some/most BAs are also in english. The language might take you almost everywhere in everyday's matters, but don't expect everyone to speak properly or understand you. It is also one of the most expensive cities in Switzerland.
Also, the university scene is not very big, compared to the city's size, it's a rather small university, and most students are locals (typical ticinesi, going home for meals, having mom do their laundry and coming back for the week with tupperware ready meals, and not being overly friendly with newcomers) or living at commuting distances in the rest of the Canton or nearby Italy, so, as told by my cousin, there's not much going on.",0,1358694528,null,0,false,0,c809kuo,t3_16t664,t1_c809kuo,t3_16t664,null,1431021530,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

It may be right in some cases but you can't say it's only based on fiscal evasion. For example, there's a lot of people who want to have their money in a stable country, as opposed as Russia in the 90s. Another point is the profesionnalism of the swiss bankers, the secrecy, etc. 

These moves from different countries (Like France, Germany, etc) are common, in Europe and elsewhere as the crisis from the subprimes (which, by the way, had been brought by the US bankers) turned out to be the worst economic crisis since 1929.

1) The manufacturing of diapers has evolved to a point where most diapers are equally as good. In fact, more people than ever are turning to lesser know brand names that in most cases of equal or better quality than pampers for significantly cheaper. Examples of this include the incredibly successful low budget lines at Coop and Migros. In our case, Nappy.ch provides a entirely Swiss made nappy that is eco friendly and carbon neutral. Something than Pampers does not provide. 

2) The price at Denner is part of a ""special action"" for the last 6 months, many swiss retailers have been liquidating / slashing prices on Pampers due to poor sales performance. Pampers's regular price is more expensive than ours.
