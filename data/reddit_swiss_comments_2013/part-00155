true,Euksel,null,null,"I have a theory that this might be a vicious circle of some sort. Because they need new drivers (I think they need to replace 1000 of their 2500 passenger drivers in the next decade), it puts more stress on the existing ones. More trains require more drivers, which means that if you don't get any new ones, you'll have to get your existing ones to spend more time.

Therefore, they would have the problems they are facing now. Less breaks, harder shifts. That makes the job unattractive for youths, especially with the wages that cannot compare to an academical degree.

However, I have absolutely no idea if they are actually lacking drivers *right now*.

true,Euksel,null,null,"I'm not really surprised, as I've said. Your best bet would be a young doctor, someone in their 20s, perhaps early 30s. But that's not a guarantee either.

If you feel comfortable with involving someone else, you could ask about any young Swiss you know. As I've said, the educational system changed in the last few decades and English has slowly become a necessity. Although they're still arguing whether or not a second language (i.e. French, German) is more important than English and how many languages you should learn in kindergarten, they should be able to do English.

If you have absolutely no idea what is going on, she has likely made a file on you anyway. You could ask her assistant (I'll assume she has one) if you could get a copy of what's wrong with you, perhaps even in English.


**Edit:** In the worst case, you could play a game of gestures and pointing. That usually works in Switzerland, as we're somewhat adopted to not speaking somebody else's language.

All doctors that grew up when highschools introduced English are likely either still studying or ""earning"" their doctorate by being an assistant doctor whatsoever. It takes a lot of time and if I remember correctly, having a doctor's office is very unattractive compared to working in a hospital, wage-wise.
