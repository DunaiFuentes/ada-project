&gt;Under a new law that took effect three weeks ago with the strong backing of Gov. Rick Perry, she first must typically endure an ultrasound probe inserted into her vagina. Then she listens to the audio thumping of the fetal heartbeat and watches the fetus on an ultrasound screen.

&gt;She must listen to a doctor explain the body parts and internal organs of the fetus as they’re shown on the monitor.
