EPFL (Lausanne) and ETH (Zurich) are 2 universities that have a lot of start ups come out of them. I would consider those two place ""hubs"" but many people also live in smaller towns and places, so I would not be surprised to see starts ups based out of anywhere.

Not sure, sorry.

&gt;Would tech companies consider hiring an American? If so, what are some hurdles I should be aware of relating to interviewing, employment, and work permits?

Work permits are a big issue, yes. Companies would sooner hire someone with an existing B or C permit, or Swiss citizenship than hire someone who has yet to obtain this. Although if the interest from the company is real, it's not a deal breaker.

Languages will be another issue, start ups tend to operate in local languages of course, so unless you speak French or Swiss-German you might have some issues. I'm not in development, but I had a couple of jobs turn me down because I don't speak Swiss-German, only high German.
