As far as I understand (and please correct me if this is inaccurate): PRISM extracts data from commercial data gatherers like Google, Apple, Microsoft etc. which are all American companies.

Switzerland's privacy law can't protect your data when you give it to an American company and they store this data on servers in the US. In fact Switzerland officially calls for caution when user data is stored abroad in the US, since the privacy laws are very lax there. If PRISM is legal in the US and has only gathered data stored in the US, there has been no crime and there is nothing illegal.

Now that is probably true for the data you freely provide under Terms of Services which you had to accept when you created your Google or Facebook account. I'm not so sure what happens with data gathered from third party tracking of your internet surfing. As you might know companies like Google track you beyond the Google site using many tricks, so Google knows what you're doing even if you're not technically using Google (you only need to be logged into your Google account).

true,SwissCanuck,ge,Genève,"CH C or Schengen C? I'm somewhat baffled if you're attending school and got awarded a C - a C is a permanent resident permit. Usually only awarded to people after 5 years on a B, or family reunification reasons. 

You will end up with two papers when you come in. First a Schengen visa. This will be useful for about a week. I had a Schengen D, for instance. This allows you to land at an EU airport and enter the EU as a resident, not a tourist which is the automatic assumption. You then take your Schengen visa, head to a Swiss Population / Immigration office at which you will get a ""Permis de séjour"" which is your residency permit. I have a B for instance - my third. 

Double check which one your talking about - If you're really getting a CH C to study, I need to know who you've been buying Rolexs and Bentleys for and do the same. A C for a student is incredibly unusual. I suspect you're getting a Schengen C to land here and eventually get a CH L, or at most B.

EDIT: Regardless, if the permit you're on allows you to bring a spouse, a same-sex spouse counts. From what I've read however I don't think she could work.

When you get here you'll go to the office and get an L or a B. If its not written on any documentation you've been delivered (It should be on the ""official response"" from either the canton of Bern or the Confederation - my employer sent me this) then you won't find out until you go to the migration office here. Short story long, if you're on an L your spouse may work depending upon the mood of the Canton that day. She will have to apply and wait. If you're on a B, apparently its automatic now.

You're right in saying the info is hard to find - get used to that. Especially if you don't speak French, Swiss-German, or Italian. Keep in mind CH is the ultimate version of ""states rights"" where most decisions are made at the cantonal level. So check there first and then go federal.

Also, as someone else mentioned, englishforum.ch is an excellent resource for this sort of thing. Those folk kept me sane during the application process.
