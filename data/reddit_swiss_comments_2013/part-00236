&gt;Liebe Professorinnen und Professoren,
 liebe Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter,
 liebe Studentinnen und Studenten

&gt; Ich habe mich entschlossen, meinen auf Ende Juli 2014 angekündigten Rücktritt vorzeitig, das heisst per sofort, zu vollziehen. Ich bedaure die jetzt entstandene Situation, für die ich als Rektor letztlich die Verantwortung trage, und bin zum Schluss gekommen, dass mein Rücktritt im Interesse der Universität Zürich richtig ist. In den vergangenen knapp siebeneinhalb Jahren, während denen ich Prorektor und dann Rektor war, ist viel erreicht worden. Ich bin überzeugt, dass die Universität für die Zukunft gut gerüstet ist. Von Herzen danke ich der Universitätsleitung, dem Generalsekretariat und Rektorat sowie allen Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern für ihren Einsatz und für ihre Unterstützung.


&gt; Andreas Fischer

They're all [cylinder locks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_lock), but normal cylinder locks have pins on only one side of the key (see the illustrations in the german [Schliesszylinder wikipedia article](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlie%C3%9Fzylinder)). Kaba 8 cylinders have 3 pin rows ([top, left, right](http://www.kaba.ch/media/532414/v5/resized650x-1/cross-section-kaba-8-cylinder.png) of the key) with 12 positions each, Kaba 20 has 4 pin rows at [bottom-left, left, bottom-right and right](http://www.kaba.ch/media/532412/v5/resized650x-1/cross-section-cylinder-kaba-20.png) with 20 positions, and Kaba star has 8 pin rows with 26 positions.

This makes it possible to validate only part of the key in the building entry, and then validate the whole key for the apartment door. Like this, a janitor can have a building-access key which only fits to the building but to no apartment. And if you lose your apartment key, the cylinders to your apartment has to be changed. Typically, the building access will remain the same, so someone who finds your key might get access to the building, but not the apartment.

If you have an electronic lock such as the Kaba Elostar, then you can specifically lock out one key. If you lose your key, the building administration can simply reprogram the doors.

You can find more details about Kaba Star, 20 and 8 here: http://www.kaba.ch/en/Solutions/Mechanical-locks/8122/lock-cylinders-with-reversible-keys.html

They like routine and hardly try new things or new ideas. They are often naive but also nice and maybe a bit reserved especially towards people who don't fit into their own world.

The other kind usually has a favorite kind of music that they prefer and they'll be rather vocal about it. Electro, hiphop, rock, there are many budding scenes and they all have their own clubs and dresscode. The modern kids are often broke as they spend most of their money on nightlife, travel or new gadgets such as smartphones.
