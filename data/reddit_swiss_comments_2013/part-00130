true,NotRogerFederer,zh,Zürich,"I think just tell them that you’d prefer if they spoke Swiss-German with you BUT give them a valid reason. As suggested «I want to improve my Swiss-German» or «I want to learn the local language». Because then they know your intentions (even though they can be different) and don’t feel as they have to serve you the best by speaking your native tongue to accommodate you the most. Especially in professional scenarios they don’t want you to feel embarrassed or else. But if you tell them you want it because you’re trying to learn Swiss-German, they don’t worry anymore that you might feel uncomfortable because some understanding issues might occur.

In other words: If you just tell them that you can speak German with them, they think you do it in their interest and they’ll be like: «Oh no, don’t worry, we can speak English, no problem» and do this to make you, the customer/friend/whatever comfortable. If you tell them they should please speak German with you because you want to lean in, you relieve them of their thinking to have to «serve» you to their best and they know you want this and if they now speak English with you, they don’t serve you to your preference anymore.
