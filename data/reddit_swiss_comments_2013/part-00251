true,FreeTheTitties,null,null,"Montreux is quite low and a city. That would be a coin flip, but even if it snows, it's nowhere as cool as in higher altitudes. City snow sucks.

This said, Switzerland is small, very small. I checked, 186 times smaller than Australia, a little more than 3x the Sydney area. You don't have to settle for one region and then stay there. Rent a car or use public transportation (we have probably the world's best train network) and you can go to any place in a couple hours. With a car, I don't think you're ever more than 10min away from a small villages where you can take a walk in the fields/forrest/snow. You may want to take a look at the satellite view on GoogleMaps.

Caution though: while renting a car is your best option, drive very carefully if you never had before on iced/snowy roads. ",0,1385196521,null,0,false,0,cdl36h3,t3_1r9pxf,t1_cdl36h3,t1_cdl1map,null,1428541374,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
