true,CalibratedChaos,ag,Aargau,"As an American in Switzerland (a bit north in Aargau):

With business colleagues, there is plenty of small talk between each other, especially on coffee breaks. 

In other casual business, I.e. transacting business at a store, there is none. Conversation is efficient and pertinent. 

If you are walking around outside a city, pedestrians ""salute"" each verbally as they go by. Not an invitation for a conversation. 

Meetings between business partners (i.e. A company and their customer) are very formal. Wear a suit. Coffee must be provided. 

On the telephone, you will exchange many goodbyes at the end of a conversation: Tschüss! Atee! Auf Wiederhören! Often right in a row. They just do that. 

---

In general, the Swiss are unfailingly polite and friendly when the situation requires, but it rarely requires. They are extremely slow to make friends, as Swiss society doesn't feature nearly as many long-distance relocations as American, so there is never a need to make new friends after you've been in school. Don't interpret this as coldness or disinterest - it's just a cultural difference.

The why there is a draft for everyone is easy: Traditionally, the Swiss army is a militia army: Every male citizen must serve, it's part of every citizen's duty. You also must understand that although Switzerland has been surrounded by wars, we haven't been fighting wars for about two centuries, always, luckily, spared wars on our territory. Because of this and because of our neutrality, the chance of people serving actually having to go to war is about zero. Which probably helps not making big changes to it.

There are, of course, discussions going on about the future of the Swiss army. Some want everyone to serve. Others want a much smaller force, only professionals. Others want to keep the current system (one argument: it's difficult to use a milita army against your own people, because everyone's in it). And of course, quite a lot of people don't want an army. I don't know if you're aware of it (not knowing how old you are / how long, if at all, you've been to Switzerland), but in 1989 we had a vote on abolishing the army altogether.

So obviously, doubling the obligatory recruitement pool would conflict with the goal to have less soldiers.

Switzerland is divided into 4 language regions, German in the North and centre, Italian in the South (Ticino), French in the west to the south-west and Romansh in small parts of Graubunden (only about 30'000 speakers). Some regions are bilingual or even trilingual. 

The population size just jumped over 8'000'000 this year. With about 22% being foreigners, not counting foreigners which have received the Swiss pass by now. Large immigration from the ex-yugoslavian states and Turkey. 

Most popular sports are Football, Ice Hockey and Skiing. The traditional national sports, called Schwingen (Swiss wrestling) and Hornussen have a large followship in central Switzerland, especially Schwingen. 

The 5 largest cities of Switzerland are, Zurich, Geneva, Basel, Lausanne, Berne, in that order. With agglomeration Basel would probably be at 2nd behind Zurich. The capitol is Berne. 

Switzerland is one of the few countries in central Europe to still have military conscription, even though it has been neutral for over 150 years. The Swiss army also has the job to protect it's neighbour, Liechtenstein.

Talking about neighbours, Switzerland boarders 5 countries, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, Italy and France. 

Biggest export products of Switzerland are food goods (chocolate, cheese, etc), specialised machinery, pharmaceuticals (Novartis, Roche) and banking services. Switzerland is also building the longest train tunnel in the world right now, after already having the 3rd longest road tunnel (Gotthard Road Tunnel), with a length of 57km (Gotthard Base tunnel)!! 

A little more Geography facts, Switzerland is split up into 26 cantons (comparable to states in the US), 20 of them being full cantons, 6 being half cantons. The Rhine has it's spring in Switzerland, then flowing through the Bodensee, through Basel and then heads into Germany. Switzerland is also not all mountain! Though being famous for it's Alps, a large proportion of the country and it's population is located at the midlands.
