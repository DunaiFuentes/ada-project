true,rockenrohl,null,null,"Again (and for the last time, since you don't seem to believe me anyway): You wouldn't believe some of the fucked up shit that ends up on the comment moderation sections of the big sites on a daily basis (I'm talking hardcore sexist, racist, offensive, stupid, violent stuff). You don't want your average reader to see that shit (it turns you off, it makes the level of discussion even worse, etc.), and then there's the problem that you, as the publisher, will eventually have to delete it anyway, because you will be asked by rightfully angry readers/advocacy groups/relatives/neighbours/churches/whatever depending on the fucking topic of the article to take the offensive stuff down, or else you'll get calls from their lawyers. And you do. And as I said: Nobody got time for that. Nobody got the personnel for that.

last edit: Also, since you're claiming that none such laws exist in Switzerland, and that I should prove they do: Well, I'm no lawyer, and I have other things to do atm than do research on this particular topic, but YOUR claim would basically mean that it would be legal in Switzerland to publish racist/xenophobic literature by someone else. Which thankfully isnt the case (there are many cases of publishers being prosecuted). So arguably (again, I'm no lawyer), I'd say that an owner of a site is responsible for its content, no matter who the content is from. At least that's how it's handled: What's on your page is, in the end, your responsibility, no matter if it is from a reader who unfortunately happens to be crazy in the head and tells his compatriots to kill politician x because of y. I'm sure that if a case ever ended in front of a judge, there'd be a big difference between a text by your own journo and one by a reader - but I'm also quite sure you couldn't just make the case: ""Well, they just write whatever the fuck they want, we have no control over it"". I'm a 100% convinced this would never fly in court (not with the stuff you see on a daily basis).",0,1388114391,null,0,1388115747,0,ceawixu,t3_1tly6g,t1_ceawixu,t1_ceaiho2,null,1427973760,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
true,FreeTheTitties,null,null,"1. Definitely learn some french. At least get a dozen or so sentences together and learn a few hundred words. Not trying at all gives a bad first impression. Also, if talking to random people who may not speak english very well, you have much higher odds to get a response/help if they can at least grasp a few words.

2. Looks like you just need some basic diplomas.

3. A good one - I guess. I've never heard anything negative about Asians from people here. There are approximatively 120k people coming from Asia who live in Switzerland, so that's not much. 

4. Sure. This said, crime exists everywhere and we have quite a big share of foreign criminals here (French, Romanians (/Roma), etc.). Swiss people are usually pretty 'distant', 'polite' and 'cold', so if someone starts getting a bit too close to you for your taste, you should have an eye on them. If you need help, you can call the police at no costs at 117. 

5. It's expensive, everyone will tell you that. We can give you some prices if you want.

6. Meh. People generally dislike dealers, so you may not start talking about your business/consumption to everyone. Is pot illegal? Yes. Are we going full 'war on drugs'? No, not at all.

&gt; but YOUR claim would basically mean that it would be legal in Switzerland to publish racist/xenophobic literature by someone else

No. My claim means exactly what I said before: if someone publishes a libel or similar thing, you, as a website owner, is not liable. The one who writes it is liable. Yes, of course, it's your duty, as a publisher, to remove such comments after and if you don't have time for that, maybe you should go work somewhere else. Or remove comments altogether.

If such a case ends up in the police, they will order you to provide them with information about comment poster, ip address, other comments, everything you have. This is what really happens in real cases. 

Now, I even can understand your point about lots of bad comments or even spam comments that need to be premoderated. There is a tradoff.

true,spicyasfuck,lu,Luzern,"Hi! that is so exciting! I am from lucerne but in an exchange year in Florida atm. 

1. Since it's winter now you should go skiing or sledging (I think that's the wordin english). We have some pretty nice ski resorts around Lucerne. You should totally visit mount Pilatus.
If you wanna come around in Europe I can recommend [InterRail](http://www.sbb.ch/en/leisure-holidays/europe-worldwide/europe-by-train/interrail.html). If you like animals we have some Zoo's, if you like hitch hiking we have a lot of mountains around us, for shopping Zurich or Genf are probably the best places to go to. Or to Milano on a weekend. If you like water and slides, you should go to the [Alpamare](http://www.alpamare.ch/). There's a lot to do in Switzerland and because of the good public transportations you're very fast on different places :)

2. Clubbing. Since you've been 18 almost every club should leave you in. I think the best ones are [Rok](http://www.rokklub.ch/start/) [Pravda](http://www.pravdaclub.ch/) or [Vegas](http://www.vegasclub.ch/). If you don't want to stay in Lucerne, [Kaufleuten in Zürich](http://www.kaufleuten.ch/events/klub/) is also very good. But you should just find it out by your own. If you don't like clubbing and prefer good food, there are also a lot of good places in Lucerne. For ""fast Food"" I really love [Soul Chicken](http://www.soulchicken.ch/de/) and [Twiny Station](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Twiny-Station-Luzern-The-King-of-Baquette-Sandwich/236402790335). For ""real"" Restaurants there is [Pacifico](http://www.pacifico-luzern.ch/) for Mexican Food, [Mama Leone](https://plus.google.com/110524866001233088371/about?gl=ch&amp;hl=de) for italian food, the 3 different [Shanghai's](http://tel.search.ch/luzern/haldenstrasse-23/shanghai-nr-3) and the [Fondue House](http://fondue-house.ch.tertia.sui-inter.net/index.php?langId=1) for original swiss Fondue. If you just want to drink something somewhere, I really like the [Parterre](http://parterre.ch/), the [Seebar](http://www.kkl-luzern.ch/navigation/top_nav_items/cuisine/Restaurant/seebar/default.htm) or the [Sopranos](http://www.sopranos.ch/sopranos/welcome.html). The Sopranos is a smoking bar though. So If you don't smoke you probably won't like the smell in there..  
For Wellness or swimming there's our pretty new [Allmend](http://www.hallenbadluzern.ch/home/page.aspx?page_id=3579). You can also go to the gym there but I think you have to sign a contract. I'm not sure though. If the weather is nice I really like just going for a walk on the lake or in the [Konsipark](http://www.luzern.com/de/dreilindenpark). But I think that's where you are going to school anyways. It's really pretty up there! While you're there you should also visit the [Museggmauer](http://www.museggmauer.ch/), it's a part of the old citywalls from Lucerne. 
In summer for swimming in the lake I really like [Seebadi](http://www.seebadluzern.ch/html/dasbad.htm) or [""Schötti""](http://www.badi-info.ch/lu/strandbad-aufschuette.html), which is free. 

3. If you're female, don't be alone around the train station in the night. Unfortunately a lot of homeless people hang around there..  Just don't be rude and you should have a nice stay. I think most of the people in Lucerne are pretty nice :-)

4. It depends where you're staying. If you live in a host family I don't think you have to bring stuff like this. If you have your own appartment or room or idk, you should probably bring some towels and bedsheets. One thing is really true, everything in switzerland is so much more expensive.
