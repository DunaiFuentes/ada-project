The victim's family should reach out to the media to make this as public as possible and they should try to get a conviction going - before then nothing is going to happen. 

Also I'm afraid people who expect a fast extradition and/or monetary compensation will be dissapointed. The law that people mention in the xposted thread only applies to felonies that would be prosecuted by the state (as opposed to civil law enforcement which monetary compensations would fall under), and even then an extradition is impossible unless the woman would agree (no state extradites their own citizens). 

She may spend some time in prison here (also unlikely, even with a conviction - see Polanski, and he wasn't even a Swiss citizen) and probably couldn't travel to the US anymore, effectively destroying her career, but unless **a court tried and convicted her** we're all just following an internet rumour and nothing will ever happen. 

I'm sorry if I come off as an ass, but this is a quiet reality check.

Welcome to the club.

Talking to strangers randomly, except for wishing a good day or offering to help with something, is uncommon and might even be perceived negatively. This is particularly true in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. The French and Italian sides are more open (based on my observations).

False. Military fireams can freely, and without the need for **any** justification, be deposited in arsenals. In fact, keeping your firearm after your military service requires a firearms acquisition permit.
