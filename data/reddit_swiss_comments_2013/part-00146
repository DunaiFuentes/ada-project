Also, the policy changes targeting foreigners tend to target precisely those who come to work honestly and don't do shit for those who simply come hear to commit felonies... these guys are hard to catch, not like they establish themselves here.

The other things are going down because in general society is becoming less violent and we have it better than ever. The economy has a huge impact on crime stat, and since our economy is OK while our neighbors have a harder time, we suffer from their increase in crime while having a decrease in crime ourselves.
