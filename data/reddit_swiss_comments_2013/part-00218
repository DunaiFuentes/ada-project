I now only buy organic milk products, and again, the prices for organic milk are crazy, and the taste is just not as good as the one at home).
* Kirschstängeli (yes, there's alcohol in chocolate here, too, but nothing comes even close)
* Feldschlösschen (don't judge me, I grew up on this stuff, it's totally the best lager in the world for my taste buds)
* Elmex, and other everyday hygiene products (seriously, Americans are kinda crazy when it comes to this stuff. Everything is hyper-bleaching whitening anti-bacterial... I just want a great normal toothpaste and normal soapy stuff without too much chemical waste on my body).
* Migros Ice Tea &amp; Coop Bio Alp Tea
* Cheap, good, sparkling (non treated/non strange-tasting) mineral water (like Aproz etc.).

* Bagels. Seriously, all varieties, huge selection in every supermarket, this is the best breakfast stuff ever, I just don't get tired of eating these
* All things Mexican. Have developed a serious Mexican food addiction here. ALL the fresh stuff, the hot stuff, all the beans, all the tortillas/flautas/burritos, all the cheeses/quesadillas - it's just great, and there's only one kind of a rather boring fast-food-variety in Migros and Coop.
