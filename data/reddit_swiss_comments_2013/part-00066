There are some very well-respected researchers who are at the SwissTPH.  The vibe I get from American public health faculty is that the SwissTPH is that it's still a growing institution. In Switzerland, if you plan to work in public health, this is the premier institution. Internationally, Swiss universities get a bit of a leg up because of its proximity to international organizations - WHO, ICRC, HQs of lots of NGOs.  
I think the most important thing to consider is if what you plan to do after your MSc. If it is public health work in the US, I would strongly suggest staying stateside for your degree. If it is a doctorate degree, SwissTPH would not hurt, especially if you work with some of their more well-known researchers.

As far as i know, if you already have a job in Switzerland it shouldn't be a big problem to get a permit to work for more than 90 days.

http://www.bfm.admin.ch/content/bfm/en/home/themen/arbeit/eu_efta-angehoerige.html

&gt;L: Short-term

&gt;The length of the employment contract determines how long this permit is valid but it typically ranges from three to 12 months and is given to people who will work in the country for less than one year. EU/Efta nationals looking for a job also receive this permit after being in the country for three months. You are allowed to change where you live (cantons) and jobs.
 
&gt;If you plan to work in Switzerland for less than three months per calendar year, you may not need a permit at all. Under certain conditions, EU/Efta citizens with a job in Switzerland, those who are providing services in the country, and workers of other nationalities posted briefly to Switzerland by EU/Efta companies can take advantage of an online registration procedure. It only applies to employment in Switzerland lasting up to three months per calendar year and must be done before a person actually starts to work for the Swiss employer.
 
&gt;The exact preconditions for this procedure depend upon the nationality of the worker and/or the location of the company dispatching the worker. The Federal Migration Office has specific information on this.

&gt;B: Initial residence permit
This residence permit is granted to persons who have an unlimited employment relationship or one lasting for at least 12 months. It has a period of validity of five years and will be automatically extended for five years as long as the employment relationship continues. That said, the extension may be limited to one year if the person is unemployed for longer than 12 consecutive months. Persons who settle in the country without gainful employment (provided they have enough financial backing) also receive a B permit.
 
&gt;Persons wishing to be self-employed can get a B permit valid for five years provided they can prove they can make ends meet being self-employed.


So if you work less than a year but more than 90days, get a L permit, more than a year B permit.
