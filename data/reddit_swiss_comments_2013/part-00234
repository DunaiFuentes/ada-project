Move to Lausanne, and it all looks quite different!  
Another point is linked to conformism and can be exploited to actually have a semblance of a ""normal"" (i.e. like probably everywhere else around the world) social life. The Swiss like their lives well organised. Join a club (or similarly *sturctured* organisation) and regularly participate in its activities and you'll have your social life (e.g. Thursday's from 18:30 to 20.00 sharp, and every first Saturday afternoon of the month) and a bunch of Swiss people (real and naturalised) who now feel like it is officially appropriate and allowed to interact with you (and each other). Don't expect too much spontaneity or activities that diverge from the club's purpose and its regulatory framework, though (unless you get them drunk - a drunk Swiss loses his or her ""bâton dans le cul"" (their stick up their ass) and is everyone's best friend and suddenly behaves like some sort of Italian or so).
