I don't mind helping people out that come here and have a question or two about Switzerland, happens on other subreddits as well and is more or less acceptable there. We are indeed few engough as it is without wanting to alienate people further I believe that splitting this wee subreddit into an even smaller reddit is just going to make things worse.

As for solution #1, seriously, what's with all the rules? I can understand and appreciate that things need to be regulated, but give it some leeway. It's not like people are doing shameless self promotion on here, which for me is an absolute no-go.

Here's an example of a [Redditors Guide to Edinburgh](http://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/pptc1/the_redditors_guide_to_edinburgh/) - it's by no means very extensive and doesn't even come close to covering everything that is available in the city but it helps a lot of people as a starting point when the come to visit the city. Apart from that, I don't think anyone on the /r/Edinburgh reddit minds people asking some questions. Besides if they are really bothered by it, and as someone mentioned this in an earlier post, there's the upvote downvote system.

Starting a sticky or an FAQ with suggestions about Switzerland have already been talked about and I think it's about time /r/Switzerland has a chance to create such a sticky as a community - there are plenty of older threads on this forum already with plenty of good suggestions and links and its about putting it all in one place and in a presentable for format. So chop, chop, off we go!

Lastly, I can't help myself, but feel that in this day and age Reddit acts as a first place for people to go to to get some information on a place or country they'd like to visit. So I guess we have to ask ourselves if we want to provide those tourists with a friendly impression that makes them look forward to coming to visit our beautiful country or not.
