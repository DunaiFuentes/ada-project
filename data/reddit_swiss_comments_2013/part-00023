true,schreckgestalt,zh,Zürich,"Quite an accurate description of what's happening.

Me and my girlfriend went to from Zurich to Lausanne recently, and the ticket machine at Zurich Station (Sihlpost) was broken, so I said ""no problem, I'll buy one on my smartphone"", which I then did. When the SBB-person arrived to check our tickets, I presented my GA as well as my smartphone-ticket for my girlfriend. She said ""this is not valid, as the tickets are not transferable"" and proceeded to fine us the 100-something amount of CHF (even though it was clear that I was buying for her, since I have a GA).

This has become one large money-making scheme, and I hate that a ""service public"" company like SBB is doing this.

As far as I know, people will understand you if you speak German, but you may not understand them :) In my experience, in the German part of Switzerland most of the people speak English.

And finally.... I've lost you at the ""not-too-expensive"" :) Unfortunately, trains are quite expensive (but really good and comfortable). You can easily check the fares from Switzerland to Germany on the [SBB website](http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html) (consider that the first price you'll see is for the owners of the half-fare card, you'll have to double it!).

I think SBB really *really* needs to implement a system like in Japan with prepaid RFID value cards that you scan on entering and exiting the station. You wouldn't have to interact in any other way with the machine, so these kind of machines can be made much more durable than those flimsy touchscreen vending machines. 

This could be made to work even without having barriers at station entrances - simply fine someone a standard fee who hasn't scanned on exiting after, say, 12 hours. And it would only require a slight change in the billing system by not having fees depending on the exact route (which is IMO unnecessary anyway).
