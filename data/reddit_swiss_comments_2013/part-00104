However, the people who started flipping shit last night are the worst fucking kind there are in our city. Using an event like this to fight with the police, destroy other's properties, vandalize stuff. It makes me sick to my stomach.

After the TdF last year, the reaction from the city's politicians was mostly positive, they saw our concerns with night life and vouched to change something - and they really had a great amount of discussions over the last year.

Now with the latest episode of TdF it is pretty clear what nearly every older non-participating Bernese's view of ""the youth of Bern"" is: We are a bunch of party-making, vandalizing, drunk idiots.

There you find some enlightening statements such as 
&gt;Nicht zulassen will der Bundesrat hingegen die Online-Durchsuchung des Computers sowie die Überwachung eines Raums mit der Kamera oder dem Mikrofon des Computers. Zudem will der Bundesrat, dass GovWare nur zur Aufklärung von besonders schweren Straftaten eingesetzt wird, bei denen auch eine verdeckte Ermittlung zulässig wäre. 

or

&gt;Überwachungen dürfen die Behörden nicht präventiv durchführen, sondern nur im Rahmen eines Strafverfahrens. Sie müssen von der Staatsanwaltschaft beantragt und vom zuständigen Zwangsmassnahmengericht genehmigt werden.

In essence they're just updating the law to the internet age. They're already doing everything mentioned with your written correspondence (letters and other old-fashioned things that keep your mailman employed) if the conditions I mentioned above are met. 

I'm not saying it's a good thing, but calm your hyperbole and let the councils debate about this first. Then, *if* it passes, you can take the Referendum because you have something substantial on your hands and you need less signatures.

I'm only slightly more familiar with it. The problem that I have with the data collection is how vast it is. It's ""Randdaten"" - which (as far as I know) does not include the actual payload, as in the actual image on a webserver for example, but the time, URL, IP (which obviously is connected to the owner of said IP). 

This includes your browsing from your phone, therefore it would be easy to create a profile of where you are (very inaccurate, only down to the cell tower) - but still. It also includes queries to search engines (and other pages where you put in data which is passed by URL) that to not use SSL (google with SSL is safe - default for me, don't know if it is for everyone). (so what is this thing good for if in the end everyone switches to SSL?)

Even without going in the technicalities, such systems which collect data just screams to be of abused - by the state or by private citizens. It happened in Germany - and Switzerland has a history of creating files on innocent civilians. I'm not the tinfoil hat kind of guy, but I must acknowledge what has happened already.
