true,GizmoC,null,null,"&gt;Statistically spoken, something like this has to happen once in a blue moon. There could be years of almost nothing and then a series of accidents.

Good point. Which is why rare events (much like a train crash) follow a Poisson distribution. 

Spoken simply, rare events can happen in quick succession and yet still be considered random. But people often conflate 'randomness' with 'uniformity'... and counterintuitively think that ""something is fishy""",0,1375251572,null,0,false,0,cbdwakx,t3_1jahoz,t1_cbdwakx,t1_cbcuays,null,1429998178,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

I personally love the fireworks display which is typically quite good but I cannot stand all the annoying atmosphere of hundreds of barbecues making the air unbreathable and disrespect of many people who throw trash around. Plus there's always some drunk ass who ends up almost injuring people with his fireworks and firecrackers in the middle of the crowd so I get nervous.
