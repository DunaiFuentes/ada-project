For an American it's not easy - any company has to first of all prove they absolutely can't find anyone from Switzerland or the EU-25 (old European states) before they're allowed to offer the job to anyone in the ""rest of the world"". I've known a friend who was stung by this before, as one director objected to her hiring on such grounds and she was forced out of the country (temporarily).

So yeah, typically you need to be a specialist at something if you're not European. Fluent German/French is often a requirement of jobs as well, except for those in multinationals like the biotech giants in Basel, physicists in Geneva or finance in Zurich or Bern.

I might suggest you consider relocating here as a student for a while and conducting a masters or doctorate, if language skills and funds permit.
