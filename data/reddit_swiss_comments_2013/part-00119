true,andres_delannoy,cern,CMS,"Hi!

I think it's easiest, and perhaps more productive, to setup a ROOT environment on your afs area (i.e. on lxplus). If you a registered CMS user, you can [accomplish this](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookSetComputerNode#WorkArea) relatively easily. If not, it's still easy enough to do. Open up your OSX terminal, ssh into lxplus, and run these commands:

    $ ssh -X username@lxplus5.cern.ch
    [lxplus] $ mkdir 5.30.00/
    [lxplus] $ cd 5.30.00/
    [lxplus] $ cp -r /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.30.00/x86_64-slc5-gcc43-opt/root/ .
    [lxplus] $ . /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.3.2/x86_64-slc5/setup.sh
    [lxplus] $ . root/bin/thisroot.sh
    [lxplus] $ root -l
    root [0]

This should get you a running ROOT 5.30.00 environment, albeit some ""missing library"" complaints. 

If you really need to install ROOT locally on your MAC, I can be of less help (meaning I can't guarantee this will work)... But, try downloading and extracting the appropriate OSX binary for your system (find 'OSX' under 'Binaries' [here](http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/production-version-534)). As an example, let's assume you're running OS X 10.6. Fire up your OSX terminal and run these (more info/details in the [README](http://root.cern.ch/lxr/data/root/README/README)):
    
    $ mkdir 5.3.4/
    $ cd 5.3.4/
    $ wget ftp://root.cern.ch/root/root_v5.34.08.macosx106-x86_64-gcc-4.2.tar.gz
    $ gunzip root_v5.34.08.macosx106-x86_64-gcc-4.2.tar.gz
    $ tar xvf root_v5.34.08.macosx106-x86_64-gcc-4.2.tar

I'm assuming your OSX terminal shell is bash (which is the default, [more info](http://support.apple.com/kb/ta27005)). To check, make sure

    $ echo $SHELL

returns '/bin/bash'. If so, do:

    $ . root/bin/thisroot.sh
    $ root
    root [0]

&gt; Over recent weeks, members of the TE-VSC group have been removing seven components of the beam pipe located at the heart of the CMS detector. The delicate operations involved have been performed in several stages as the detector opening work has progressed.

&gt; Of the seven components concerned, only the central vacuum pipe will be replaced. The other six will be stored in a special radiation-shielded area on the surface and subsequently reinstalled ready for the resumption of machine operation.

&gt; The video below [sic], which was filmed on 15 May, shows one of the seven components of the vacuum pipe – the HFCT2, located to the right of the interaction point – being brought up from the CMS cavern to the surface by the transport team at Point 5.",0,1371231068,null,0,false,0,caiwkql,t3_1gcluy,t1_caiwkql,t3_1gcluy,null,1430809806,1,false,CERN,t5_2r692,1

true,buyacasha,zh,Zürich,"&gt; I was wondering what you guys think I should know about your country before making a decision.

It's a good decision. An internship abroad always looks good on a resume. And you'll enjoy Switzerland.

&gt; I would be going in the summer time for 8-10 week

You mean 2014, right?

&gt; would love to be anywhere in the Alps as that, in my eyes, is the most beautiful part of the world. 

As an American you might not realize how small Switzerland is. If you're somewhere central, say for example Lucerne, you can make day trips to some beautiful mountain regions. No problem at all. If you truly enjoy hiking you can also make weekend trips and stay at [SAC huts](http://www.sac-cas.ch/en/huts.html) over night.

&gt; Are there companies that do this sort of thing for ME majors in that area?

Companies that need MEs? Plenty. Companies that do summer internships? No idea (This concept is not as widespread as it is in the US). Try ABB, Komax, Siemens, etc. There are tons.

&gt; How many people speak English?

The younger generation will often speak English well.

&gt; How easy is it to travel to other countries on the weekend?

No problem via train. 

&gt; Is there any reason I shouldn't do this?

No reason at all. Again, getting some experience in a foreign country and culture is never bad. Also, Switzerland is definitely not the worst choice.

&gt; Is there anything major that I should consider?

Check the Visa requirements. Also, remember that in Switzerland it is usual to have a photo &amp; birthdate on your application.


Hope that helps! Any more specific questions, just ask.
