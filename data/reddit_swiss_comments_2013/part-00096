This means that you have to pay as soon as the computer is connected to the interwebs.
But even if you should not have internet at home via fixed network: Having a smartphone with internet access obliges you to pay the fee.

If you cancel Billag without complying to the requirements, you render yourself liable to prosecution with a fine of up to 5k CHF!

Checklist:
- Screen with built in tuner in the house (even if not connected) --&gt; Billag
- Some sort of external receiver in the house --&gt; Billag
- Smartphone (also if used as AP for your computer) --&gt; Billag
- Broadband internet and a device to access it --&gt; Billag

The only way not to pay Billag is:
- Surfing with an 56k modem
- Using a mobilephone that is NOT ABLE to access internet.
- Do not possess a TV (a screen and BR/DVD is ok)
- Live in a nursing home

When I sold my last TV 15 years ago I also cancelled Billag. Then they sent someone to check if I really don't have it. That was enough, I didn't pay anything since.
