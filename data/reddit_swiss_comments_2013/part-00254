The minimum salary initiative wants to enforce a minimum wage of 22 CHF per hour of work, which corresponds to about 4000 CHF per month for a normal work week of 42h. Note that right now only about 10% of employees would be affected by this (the others having a higher salary already). On average those affected would receive something like a 15% raise. You can check some details at the [initiative homepage](http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/schweiz/xxx-1.18193406).

The citizenship salary goes further and in a different direction to this. It basically wants to introduce a fundamental salary for every citizen that takes care of the basic costs of living. I read somewhere a number of 2500 CHF per month per adult, with a bit less for children. It's a very interesting idea that is being discussed in many contexts.
