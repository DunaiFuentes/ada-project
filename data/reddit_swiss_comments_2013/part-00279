you should try to get customer service, like over mail at info@mobilezone.ch or call the customer hotline explaining your problem. Most companies in CH do help you. Going apeshit on something like that is not a solutioin.

And seriously dude, every court will laugh at everything for sueing below 10'000 CHF.
Unless you have legal insurance (and they will not go to court, not even advise it), the lawyer will cost you more then the phone anyways.
