Despite that, I'm still not sure if it is wrong to write something like that.

If I try to think rationally about your scenario, I come to the following result:

* How I would feel: Of course, angry and sad
* Also, it would cause me to lose hope.
* You say that it is a bad thing to lose hope. I agree it is in most situations bad. But I think, in that situation it could be good/better.


Because I can't think of a case that relatives found the missing person themselves. Usually they're found by accident, I think. Therefore it doesn't change much, if they lose hope, exept that they are even happier, when they get the message that the missing person is alive. Also, if they find a body, they would be less sad since they already adapted to that thought.


Also I saw parents of a missing person be happy after they found out that the body was found after a decade or so. They were happy because they could finally stop searching and worrying.


PS: I'm sorry if my thoughts are upsetting. But I think that saying what you think is usually not a bad thing. Although I wouldn't say my first comment to a relative or friend of a missing person.

-A petition is a request to the authorities, an initiative is a proposition/offer from the sovereign citizens (this sounds weird, I couldn't translate it well.

-A petition does not have any rules (no limits on who signs it, how many sign it, etc...), an initiative can only be signed by swiss citizens who can vote, must be signed by a certain number of citizens, must be delivered in a certain way after a certain time, etc...

-An initiative is related to law, it asks for a law to be created, changed or suppressed, a petition treats of whatever it wants.

-A petition can be ignored by the government, an initiative can not.

Put simply an initiative does not have much weight.

First the flat. There are cooperatives that are half of the usual rate. Yes, the flat is maybe 20 years old, but who cares, you save the amount of your **stupid American tax** in rent every month, so this problem is solved by investing some time until you found one. The demographics works for you, daily.

Second: going out. Well, if you drink wine when going out, your problem. The wine in restaurants is most of the time a ripoff, and if you want to dine with a first-rate wine, then you go eating in high class hotels/restaurants like the fourth king or something. And no wonder it is expensive there. Almost every family I know eats in restaurants once quarterly.

Hand-me down furniture? Hm, you expats are so posh, there are *businesses* thriving on reselling last years furniture. And because you expats are always eating in restaurants or on the road (like most are used from home), the furniture isn't even used. We took the extreme path and furnished our flat for 3k. Delivery incl. Kitchen and cookware for 600. Everything. 

Flat in the city. Well, I live in walking distance to the center. My brother rented an attic apartment right in the city for 1500. Be creative, save a ton of money. If you can throw a party and can organize interesting guests, not one of them will shun you because your apartment is not built according to international taste.

Also: car. Stupidest ""investment"" in Switzerland, if you live as a Yuppie. Seriously, I doubt anyones intelligence if they compare the 5800 - for the first class GA no less - to the cost of gas. Yes, maybe you use only 5800.-/year for gas. But what about insurance, repairs and *the fucking costs of the car itself*? Most do not buy a Skoda, but it just *has* to be a Mercedes, BMW or something even more costlier. Which weigh more. And use more gas. W.T.F.
