You don't have to explain me what you did, in contrast to you I'm able to understand what others write even it it's not explained in every small detail to me.

&gt; and I think it's funny how the leftist/liberals think their option is modern and moderart and someone who doesn't agrees with them is from the dark ages.

Just because I listen to other opinions does not mean I'm stupid and don't see when people try to ridicule points I made. It's especially evident because you ignore **every single** argument I made and don't even try to rebuke. I was and am able to have serious decent discussions with a lot of people who I don't agree with some and even most of their view points (even right wing *gasp*). And we were able to do this because they and I listened to each other and brought up coherent arguments with well thought out reasons, something you in this whole thread were not once able to do. And even with you if you read my comments I always let you the benefit of a doubt and did not make absolute statements about your person. But hey let's even go into your ""argument"":

The reason why your argument is stupid beyond believe is that we know that complex opinion as yours are not something you're born with. And we know that because children which grow up separated from their parents don't show any opinions unique to their parents. I mean that's basic biology, if you even have problem believing this, then you should really go back to school.

&gt; do you think pedophiles are ok because they are born with that too?

Actually yes. I have no problems with pedophiles as long they don't rape children or consume child porn. And I even think they should receive free (OMG what a dirty communist!!!!) help to deal with their problem and should not be shunned in public since this only drives them underground where they won't receive help and are more likely to be involved or actually hurt children.

But I understand that you will most likely not be able to empathize with them. Empathy is sadly not your strong point, which explains a lot. ",0,1372272839,null,0,1372274770,0,caqr784,t3_1gyo7b,t1_caqr784,t1_caqmfw6,null,1430674328,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
