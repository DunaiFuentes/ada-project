Now, to the beers. I just started listing all kinds of beer labels, but thought I'd rather give you a list of what I would buy (12-years experience of being a happy beer drinker). Most smaller breweries will offer 4-5 kinds of beers: Lager, unfiltered, wheat, amber and a dark one. I added the ones that I like, but tried to cover all of Switzerland, although I'm from Bern and therefore I'm a little biased.

    
**Standard beers**

*To try our standard Lager from more independent sources than Feldschlösschen (which is our largest brewery), I would suggest*

- Quöllfrisch
- Öufi Bier
- Schützengarten


**Well-known specialty beers**

*There are some labels producing slightly different beer, which is well-known and liked in Switzerland. For example, we like unfiltered beer, and a kind of Bock during holidays - and the styles listed above.*

- Felsenau Bärni (dark beer)
- Calvinus (unfiltered)
- Turbinenbräu Rekord (amber, I think it's watery and would go for a Burgdorfer or an Aare here, but hey, it's from Zürich and you should cover Switzerland's largest city, too.)
- Ittinger (amber, well-liked by everyone - I can only think of Tramdepot Märzen which is more popular, even among non-beer drinkers)

**Really special stuff**

*Now, some breweries produce interesting things. BFM for example sells their creations in NYC and is quite proud of that*

- Appenzeller Castégna (Chestnut was added to the brew before fermentation. Very subtle in taste. Was originally produced for the market in Ticino. Can be hard to find.)
- BFM beer. Now, there are plenty different ones. If you're up for an experiment, go with the Meule (contains sage). I like the Salamandre a lot myself. If you want a strong one, go for the Alex Le Rouge (10.276%)
- Swiss honey beer


Hope that helps. If you have more questions or are quite fond of a special kind of beer, please feel free to ask. Switzerland will offer most types of beer, but not ones in the style of Belgian (trappist) beers, unfortunately. Apart from that, some brewery will make it. Also, my most favourite one will not be available in Zürich, being the Tramdepot.
