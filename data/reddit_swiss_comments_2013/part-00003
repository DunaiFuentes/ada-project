I went into a store the other day and their customer service was simply rude - so I've decided to shop around a bit and change carrier again.

Sunrise to me now seems friendly again, their prices are similair to those of Orange, so it's just a question of which of the two you personally prefer.

Swisscom, well, apart from having to wait for way to long to get served they weren't friendly at all as well as tried to sell me for stupid (I simply don't tolarate that) and were ridicously overpriced for me.

I've you already got a phone, have a look at something like the M-Budget Mobile Scheme - they seem pretty reasonable.

I also looked at the payg offers, but thought otherwise - there a bit of a joke really - then again I'm used to the offers in the UK.

Please note, that these are my personal preferences and things may be very different for you (for example, I looked at young peoples offers and for personal use and not for work related things, etc). It really depends what you want to do with and what you need your mobile for. I'd suggest you shop around yourself before you make a decision.
