true,efox,null,null,"I know this doesn't exactly fit with the subreddit, but I figured you guys probably know the most about this sort of thing. I'm going with my girlfriend to Interlaken, and we'll be there for about a week. We don't have too many ideas or things planned, besides going up the Jungfrou, which we've heard is amazing.

We're both fairly outdoorsy, so any cool hikes, trails, glaciers, or stuff like that would be awesome. Also, we're both skiers, so I would be in debt to you forever if you knew of any places to go skiing in June near Interlaken. Thanks in advance for your help. 

Edit: Downvoting all my comments is pretty cool, whoever did that.",0,1243346159,null,0,true,0,c09tq2a,t3_8nbgv,t1_c09tq2a,t3_8nbgv,null,1425976595,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
true,sepukku,zh,Zürich,"If it's warm then (you can never trust the swiss weather. It was a whopping 33°C this morning and now we got rainstorms at about 16°C..) you can go hiking and enjoy the great sights.
Skiing is definitely impossible at the moment. But a glacier-hike should be possible. From what I know you pay about CHF 150.- for a day. Just call the nice people at the tourist-info.

Oh, and for a nice Dinner, you can go to the Restaurant Goldener Anker (The Golden Anchor). It's quite a famous restaurant, lots of swiss rock bands ""grew"" up there.

true,allhands,null,null,I've been to Interlaken and I'd recommend the hiking as well. There is a nice trail that starts in Iseltwald along the lake (Brienzer See) that leads up to a hotel in Giessbach. You can alternatively take a funicular up to the hotel in Giessbach if you don't want to hike and there you can have something to eat. The view is absolutely amazing there and there's a waterfall nearby as well.,0,1243376778,null,0,false,0,c09u6uf,t3_8nbgv,t1_c09u6uf,t3_8nbgv,null,1425976814,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
