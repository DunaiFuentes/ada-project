They buy up houses pushing up prices. This means more people have to rent. So rents go up. Their 'investment' is pretty much paid for by the renter, i.e. they are exploiting someone else's hard work.

For those stuck renting there is less stability and freedom with regard to their home. You have to ask permission to do many things and once your contract is up you can be thrown out and forced to move elsewhere within a month or two. Now for some, renting is a better option but buy-to-letters are removing the choice by helping to inflate property and rent prices, both of which make it harder to get on the property ladder.

Dear Mr Wiggin,

The Labour Keith Vaz has proposed an early day motion to discuss video game violence, stating that there is 'increasing evidence' of a link between violent video game players and violent criminals.

If you also think this way I'd love to have a sane, rational discussion with you and perhaps convince you that this is not the case. I suspect that Mr. Vaz's mind has already been made up and I hope to at least provide some context, if not change your opinion of gaming.

If you'd like to meet for a coffee I can assure you that I'll keep the discussion brief so as not to waste your time.

You can find more information on the motion at http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/2427

He's also said before that it's painful, but that hasn't usually affected him and I don't think it was a factor here.  This is my rationale for his being upset about it (just rambling off the top of my head):

By this point in the series, after everything that's happened to him and everything he's gone through (losing his companions in various ways, Rose's somewhat traitorous immediate acceptance of someone who isn't him [watching her kiss someone else, even if it was his clone, clearly hurt him], having to deal with the Master and the Time Lords trying to come back, still ending up as the last of his kind, etc etc etc) all just resulted in some serious angst that seems understandable, since Ten has always seemed more deeply emotional (in regards to his love of humanity, how the Time War affected him, etc) than the others.  He's not oblivious- he knows by ""Waters of Mars"" that he's cracking under the stress, what with his Time Lord Victorious spiel and declaring that the rules of time are at his whim.  And he knows that's wrong.  

That's what I think is brilliant about how they did his ending- I'm a die-hard Ten-lover, I absolutely adore Nine and Eleven, but Ten is my Doctor- and in making him crack like that, they gave his fans a way to accept that, much as they love Ten, he really just has to go, because he truly just can't handle the pressure anymore.  So I was sad when it happened, but part of me accepted that it had all been too much for his incarnation, and it really was just his time.  Made it easier to transition to Eleven.

But that didn't mean that he wanted to go- for the most part he liked himself as Ten, and like he said, he's aware of what happens- he knows that someone else with a different personality is going to walk away from the regeneration, and it won't be him at all except his memories, and that has to be upsetting after going so far and doing so much in a certain incarnation, and it had to be immensely frustrating that, while everyone, including the Doctor, loves Wilf, an entire regeneration was being essentially wasted on saving the life of one human who made a careless decision.  And that's what the Doctor is all about- the value of that one human life, and that's why he would never be able to turn Wilf down.  But can you imagine how upsetting that would be?  To have done all that, to have stopped the Master and the Time Lords and everything is back to normal and better because of you, but you know you won't be around to see it?  That's why I think he went off on that rant, which was actually really upsetting for me to watch because it wasn't like Wilf did it maliciously and it just seemed really immature and un-Doctor-like, but I understood at the same time, that no matter how powerful you are, sometimes things *just aren't fair* and I think that was what was going on.  Just a moment for Ten to rant about how absolutely infuriating things get sometimes, because he never really does that.  And it was never going to change his mind, he was always going to save Wilf, but after all that, everything was just a bit too much, and his insurmountable patience finally, finally snapped.  And I think that all of that was why he had to go, no matter how much he didn't want to go (and we didn't want to see him leave).

Sir,
Please don't sign this petition, it means nothing to the younger generations of today. Stupid psychologists believe that 'violent' video games are a leading cause for the effects on crime and social disruption. I believe that all of them are false. As an adolescent that is frequently playing these games I have no issue with the violence. I have been playing these games since I was 12 and have never committed a violent crime. These people that believe that video games are violent are people who have never really experienced the games. There are far larger problems than this in the country as well, having to deal with a petty issue such as this is also diminishing to the countries development. So to assume that the games are a leading cause of recent rioting and other violent crimes is rather ridiculous. there is no definite linking between the two trends in data.

Once again, please focus your efforts in building a worthwhile community and focus on social aspects rather than psychological aspects of the north Wiltshire community.

1) They need a coach that can help the defence. Neither AVB or Di Matteo are strong on the defensive aspect of the game, that much has become clear. Bring someone in that can help. Someone like Desailly to give some occasional help or advice would be my choice. Old Chelsea boy, knows his defending, can help get things organised.

2) Communication appears poor at the moment. No one is taking responsibility. They need to work out what they're doing, where they are and inform each other of attacking play.

3) AVB needs to make more sensible substitutions. Taking Meireles off for Mikel was strange. Keeping a 33yr old Drogba, who hasn't played a massive amount this year, on the pitch for two games in a row was bizarre. I know Torres hasn't been great but if you have him, use him. I felt he was within touching distance of getting back to it against United (that glaring miss aside) so put faith in him.

4) There are clearly a number of players in the squad that know they'll be surplus to requirements come the end of the season (even January). That isn't good for the team or morale. Unfortunately not a lot can be done about that but they aren't giving their all for the club. Be ruthless with selection, even if it means leaving out some good players and blooding some unproven players (where the fuck has McEachran been this year?). I'm sure the make up of the squad will alter drastically in the next 3 years and they'll be a good team but this transition is painful to watch.

edit: 5) Get Courtois out of Atletico and into the Chelsea 1st team. Cech has been dreadful this year, only making some of the saves you'd expect from him. The monster keeper of 5 years ago has gone and has been replaced by a shadow of his former self. It's sad to see but clearly true. He's a step behind the play all the time. Good on crosses, poor on shot stopping. (double edit): maybe the mask he's continuing to evolve is symptomatic of his mentality. Is he hiding from the game?

I'll be generous and assume the author of this article isn't a blithering idiot, which only leaves one alternative, which is that he's being completely disingenuous.

The chart shows what's caused increase in debt, compared presumably to planned spending, **from 2007 to 2011**. No one is arguing that there's been some massive collapse in public sector efficiency in this time-frame, so he's attacking a total straw man.

The criticism of the former Labour government's fiscal policy has always been that during the economic boom they ran a significant deficit.

true,skeptichectic,welsh2,South Wales but,"I hope you  don't mind Redditors, but I am stealing some of your quotes and figures in my email to my Local MP - Martin Caton, who has already signed the EDM. Will post message in later edit.

EDIT 

Dear Mr Caton,

I am writing to you regarding your recent signing of Early Day Motion 2427 - Call of Duty 3. There are many points made in the EDM that are 'gratuitously' wrong or in need of clarification.

As Amendment 2427A1 - CALL OF DUTY 3 shows 'the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) gave the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 an 18 classification, noting that `the game neither draws upon nor resembles real terrorist attacks on the underground'. 

I believe that calling on the BBFC for 'further precautions when allowing a game to be sold' is an unnecessary measure as shops which sell these games are already bound by law to restrict access; only selling to those above the age of classification. In this case, as suggested in the amendment, 'adults should be free to choose their own entertainment in the absence of legal issues or material which raises a risk or harm.'.

Being an avid gamer, with friends working in the game industry in the UK (worth around £3billion, with 48 of the world’s most profitable games studios based here) I suspect that the Labour Keith Vaz's proposed early day motion is based on a personal opinion and his mind is already made up. 

If you also have already formed such an opinion I'd love to have a rational discussion with you, to at least provide some context, if not change your outlook on gaming as a positive influence.

To state that there is 'increasing evidence' of a link between violent video game players and violent criminals is wholly incorrect and I could point out several major studies by groups such as The Harvard Medical School Center for Mental Health, The Journal of Adolescent Health, and The British Medical Journal which have all shown no conclusive link between video game usage and violent activity.

I implore you to reconsider your signing of this EDM to that of the already amended version.

Yours sincerely,

Skeptichectic.

&gt; The right to free speech, as I understand it, is the right of each human being to speak and be listened to. Denying free speech entails the systematic silencing of an individual; their ideas, their identity - and it is a gravely serious process happening all over the world. To say that the free speech of David Willetts was silenced tonight is to make a mockery of the use of the term. David Willetts is still speaking. Have you noticed? His ideas, his identity, are set to shape the future of the UK, and I'm not optimistic that anything 'we' have to say or argue will have any power - in the form of direct action, 'civilised' debate or any of the forms of 'empowerment' handed to us in controlled, boundaried forms. If you disagree and think that an 'open' debate in which questions are controlled and a man who has had the platform all his life gets it yet again - would actually have the power to change things, then I only admire your idealism and hope that it doesn't get crushed over the next few years of Willetts' government. - Lucy McMahon

I still disagree with them. Free speech is not just the lack of ""systematic silencing"". They completely ruined the opportunity to challenge his views in a constructive way and to enter into discourse. Sure, he probably wouldn't have listened, but it's worth a try.

true,Ouro,null,null,"Thanks for bringing this up. Here's what I emailed my MP:

Dear Mark Williams MP,

I'm emailing you to ask you to consider signing the amendment by Tom Watson MP (Amendment 2427A1 - CALL OF DUTY 3) to the Rt Hon Keith Vaz's early day motion ""Call of Duty 3""  (Early day motion 2427 http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/2427).

The early day motion is about the ""First Person Shooter"" computer game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and expresses concern about the content - notably decrying the claimed similarities to the Tube bombings - makes claims as to a link between computer games and violence and calls upon the BBFC to take action.

The amendment by Tom Watson MP points out:

""*leave out from `House' to end and add `notes that the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) gave the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 an 18 classification, noting that `the game neither draws upon nor resembles real terrorist attacks on the underground'; further believes that the game has an excellent user interface and challenges the gamers' dexterity as well as collaborative skills in an outline setting; and encourages the BBFC to uphold the opinion of the public that whilst the content of video games may be unsettling or upsetting to some, adults should be free to choose their own entertainment in the absence of legal issues or material which raises a risk or harm.*'""

Furthermore I am rather concerned about two additional  points:

- The Early Day Motion claims a link between video games and violence without citing any evidence for such a claim. The research in the field is unfortunately contradictory and is often rather poor. In 2010 there was a large scale analysis of earlier research that found such a link, however that study itself has been criticised as being statistically poor (http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Much%20Ado.pdf ). Moreover while there may be aggressive/violent elements to such games, such criticisms tend to ignore the more positive counter balancing aspects e.g. team work. Indeed while this particular game does feature a single player ""campaign"", the major draw to the game is the multiplayer element requiring and developing such collaborative social skills.

- The video game industry in the UK its an element of the knowledge economy that we should be championing and doing everything we can to promote as we try to draw back from the financial crisis brink and hopefully diversify away from banking sector being the be all and end all of the modern British Economy. UK sales alone in 2008 where £4 billion (http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2009/jan/07/nintendo-games) and that doesnt even factor the money brought in from world wide sales from UK based games studios/developers. This is significant as the UK is major player in the world wide video games industry, yet this early success story is begining to loose it's momentum to better supported territories (http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmscotaf/memo/video/vid09.htm and http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12326688).

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"1) Mikel should have started in place of Meireles. Meireles had a very pedestrian match, and his turnovers in the defensive half/terrible attempts at tackling certainly did not help us in the midfield battle. Meireles needs to stick to replacing Ramires/Lampard and stay away from the CDM position because he is not as good a defender as I hoped he would be. Ballack just absolutely bossed us in midfield, and Mikel at CDM would have helped to balance out the game in midfield.

(On that note, people are really over-exaggerating Mikel's mistake on the weekend against Liverpool. Yes, it was a big mistake at a very inopportune time, but when you look at the season on the whole, Mikel has been one of our few players who has regularly performed well in his position.)

2) Either Torres or Kalou should have been substituted for Drogba after Leverkusen scored their first goal. You could feel the tides shifting at that point, and despite the fact that Drogba was our goal-scorer, he had a pretty poor game overall. We were craving some pace up front, which Sturridge offered, but he had nobody to link up with coming from the wing because Drogs was walking all over the pitch. I am very concerned with Drogba's form lately. He looks like he is running in quicksand, and he isn't great at holding the ball when we send it long either. It leads me to ask the question: if he isn't pacy, and he can't hold the ball, exactly what is Drogba contributing to the squad (aside from his prowess at set-pieces)?

3) One thing I think AVB has done well is to keep starting David Luiz in place of Alex. Yes, Luiz makes some major mistakes from time to time. His major asset is that he is extremely quick at the back, which allows him to make up ground and defend when he gets beat by an attacker. Alex may be a better pure defender than Luiz, but he is slower than Terry (which is very, very slow). If there is one thing we don't need right now, it is to be slower at the back than we already are.

I don't think the issue at the back is a matter of personnel: I blame it on tactics. I think the main issue is the fact that Terry/Luiz play so far apart from each other on the field that it allows forwards to split them very, very easily. They need to quit knocking it around at the back, get the ball up field, and narrow up the defense. No more defensive nonsense.",0,1322101761,null,0,false,0,c32bew8,t3_mn6t4,t1_c32bew8,t3_mn6t4,1427921980,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"Here's some controversy, and perhaps an elephant in the room. From experience people of Indian sub-continent origin are far more likely to try to mislead during an application, apply for credit they have no means of supporting, and complain about the results.

Out of a list of 160 customers where there was an issue, more than 100 had names which would suggest an Indian sub-continent origin. I know that this does not represent the population at large. No other ethnic group shows up in this manner.

It's worth pointing out that this may be a result of a misconception rather than a reality. For example it may be that people from the sub-continent are discriminated against to the extent that they literally have to complain continuously to get the level of service other people enjoy. It may be that they feel that way without a great deal of evidence. It may be that the particular cases that come through my way have a higher propensity to be from people of Indian sub-continental origins.

I want to steer away from drawing any conclusions. Party because I realise the danger of bad statistical analysis, but also because I simply don't want to feel that I'm being racist.

However I'm faced with evidence every day that there could be a cultural difference between ethnic groups. I don't want it to be there, but it's there.

If I was to say anything at all, I'd say that in the 50 years towards the end of the last century Britain was horrifically and unforgivably racist towards ethnic minorities moving to the UK. As a result I think some people still feel they have to respond to this.

This is a very emotive thing, and something I'm particularly uncomfortable about - I'm trying to be as honest as possible, and I am not advocating any kind of racial profiling or anything like that.

Plus, I don't see how this would create an unstable time loop.  A bootstrap paradox is only unstable if an object sent back and forth in time is affected by age.  For instance, if in the future I send a key back to myself so I can open a door, then later I send the same key back, that key would eventually deteriorate to the point where it would no longer be usable.  However, if instead of sending back the same key, I have a new key cut for the same lock each time, then it that doesn't become an issue, and the loop is stable.

The Doctor seems to be familiar enough with this concept to intentionally create stable time loops.  See the Big Bang: When he asked how young Amelia knew to come to the museum, she gave him the note he had written.  Had he taken that same note and dropped it back in time, that loop would have been unstable, since the flyer would age each time.  Instead, he grabbed the less-aged version of the same flyer and wrote the note again before going to the past to drop it in her mailslot.",0,1322115322,null,0,true,0,c32d0h3,t3_mn6ft,t1_c32d0h3,t1_c329alv,1427922807,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,[deleted],null,null,"Is all this really AVB's fault though?

The United match we made a bold decision to come out and attack and we definitely played well enough to win and despite the loss everyone was rather pleased with our performance. Some bad luck cost us the match. 

The QPR loss clearly had nothing to do with him.

In the Arsenal match we were sloppy sloppy sloppy on both ends of the pitch. We can blame poor tactics, poor finishing, poor positioning, poor defending, terrible backpasses...basically the works for this one. This was a terrible game starting from AVB and right down to just about everyone wearing blue that day.

Then there is the blackburn game. AVB responded by fielding a much more defensive lineup despite playing a team like blackburn. All his critics were calling for a clean sheet and for Luiz to get out of the back line and he did just that. He started a defensive midfield with Mikel, and once the goal was secured he brought on Meireles and Romeu to see the game out

Then we have the liverpool game. AVB fielded a defensive minded squad. He had mikel and malouda and we also did not play the high line in the first half. We got bossed in the first half. In the second half we dominated with a higher line, sturridge on and the 4231 in place. Sloppy defensive positioning cost us the game. 

Against leverkusen he brought on experienced players with solid defensive capabilities to secure the win. They failed. Complacency once again cost us the points.

Others have argued that we don't have the personnel to play AVB's system. This might be true, but let's remember the reason AVB was hired in the first place. This was to take Chelsea to a new level and play more attractive football. He actually did a pretty good job at that. Chelsea have begun learning a whole new way to play the game. He was not hired to adapt to Chelsea's players and play Mourinho football and everyone knows that.

Now let's look at the squad. We obviously have a core group of older players who are no longer at their prime. Terry and Drogba are not even close to the world beaters they once were  and although this is difficult to say it is true. When we won the title under Ancelotti malouda was one of the best wingers in the prem, and Anelka was on form as a great support player. Last season Cole, Ivanovic, and Cech were our most solid and consistent performers. This year all three have had their fair share of major mistakes, and sub-par performances according to their standards. 

In the second half against leverkusen he brought on Mikel, Alex, and Malouda. These players are experienced.They should be able to lock down a game and see out the win for the team.

IMO we are going through a bad period. For whatever reason this is happening. Perhaps there is a motivation issue, AVB is not getting the most out of his players, or he is not getting his players to focus. But to me the management vs. personnel thing is at least 50/50. Without hindsight, I honestly can't think of a manager who would have made that many better decisions.

People renting have more freedom in regards to their home than someone who buys. If you want to move as a renter you just give notice. If you want to move as a home owner, you have to sell it. My neighbours, the husband who is disabled after a stroke, desperately need to move to a bungalow but can't because their house won't sell. Yesterday my toilet stopped flushing.

Firstly market confidence in government debt is high because of a commitment to cutting the deficit - which has led to us having lower yields on debt than even Germany, so debt repayments don't look set to spiral out of control. Also Debt refinancing of Gilts is not needed for many years unlike countries like Spain or Italy.

The UK financial center is the reason for the majority of that distortion, that debt isn't necessarily worrying - it is very long term debt, it just looks like a lot on the balance sheet.

Not exactly.  These figures are for legal immigration and are based on long term trends for people who are staying for more than a year.  It won't include people who come for short periods of time or illegal immigrants (of course on the flip side it also doesn't include those that leave for a short period of time or those who leave illegally).  

210k of the net migration are coming for 'formal education', although it isn't immediately obvious how those students are accounted for it they subsequently leave (or not).

Also the figures for Net migration of those with jobs don't state what the jobs are (or if they are in a different table, I didn't see them).  It might be that we're sending out thousands of people who are in jobs where there is a shortage in this country and those incoming are in jobs that already are overcrowded, thus pushing wages down.  Of course it could be the other way around (illegal immigration, for example, is something that all political parties is needed as there is a shortage in workers who want to do menial tasks).",0,1322148825,null,0,false,0,c32f7h3,t3_mnts9,t1_c32f7h3,t1_c32f3u9,1427923835,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You say 'a significant amount of the debt on their books is European sovereign debt', but as I understand it, a bank's debt is money they have *borrowed* from somewhere else (or which has been deposited, invested in the bank etc) is. it's money they theoretically should have, and someone else could ask for back.
But surely sovereign debt is when countries sell bonds, ie *they* borrow money from somewhere else (ie. banks) so if a bank buys foreign government bonds, those are investments (ie. assets) not debts, and would not appear in a reckoning of the debt on their books.

Have I got that the wrong way round?

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Well, propaganda of the deed is an important facet of anarchism, as is the freedom for each to choose the tactics they employ.  Personally speaking, my preferred tactics are less showy and (I believe) counter-productive, and thus I propagandise using different deeds.  Having said that, to the extent those involved are genuine anarchists and not just nihilists, agents provocateur and people either angry at their situation or having a 'good' time, they presumably believe it serves some useful object.

As to anarchism leading to feudalism, I'm not sure I'm with you on that one.  Are you thinking of the hierarchical and authoritarian aspects of feudalism or do you simply mean a regression to a middle-ages style standard of living?

Anarcho-capitalism (which anarchists refer to as anarcho-Statism), to the extent that it could exist at all, would almost certainly lead to feudalism of the first sort - because each capitalist landowner would essentially become the king of his or her domain.  Anarchism proper is the antithesis of this though, because anarchists oppose all hierarchies and all forms of authoritarianism.  There are some anarchists ([anarcho-primitivists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-primitivism)) who wish to return to a feral or wild state, so they would wish to deindustrialise.

For the most part though, anarchism would not intentionally establish a society anything like that of feudalism, quite the contrary, and it seems to me extremely unlikely that it would drift towards such  society unintentionally either unless something is very wrong with the various theories.  [Anarcho-syndicalism](http://anarchosyndicalism.net/index.php) would cope perfectly well with a post-industrial world, as would [mutualism](http://mutualist.blogspot.com/), and [transhumanist anarchism](http://anarchotranshumanism.com/) is even more future and technology focussed - one might argue far too future focussed for the present!",0,1322161059,null,0,false,0,c32gkb0,t3_mntiy,t1_c32gkb0,t1_c32fz1f,1427924477,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I presume that those involved in the violence are just looking for an excuse to lash out, whether they're genuine anarchists or not. Some people are just assholes, regardless of their political views. 

It's true that some people are just looking to lash out (and some people are simply engaging out of catharsis), and also true that some people in every group will be arseholes, but the genuine anarchists damaging property are likely to be targeting corporate capitalist or State property, and doing so for specific anarchist reasons.  They would view all the property as stolen, illegitimate and oppressive (and therefore fair game).  The would also consider it an act (however small and futile) against an oppressive system and a propagandist deed for the edification of the underclass.  As I say, it's not my preferred tactic, but I know why they do it.

&gt;I think that if there's no modern-style collective overarching government with all the checks and balances that go along with it, a person or group will eventually get powerful enough to coercively proclaim themselves some sort of ruler, forcing everybody else to be subservient to them. I don't think that anarchists would want that to happen, but I think it's a likely eventuality. 

Those kind of issues have been fairly comprehensively addressed by anarchists.  For example, from the Anarchist FAQ: [here](http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionI5#seci513), [here](http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionI5#seci56) and [here](http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionI4#seci412).",0,1322165682,null,0,false,0,c32h3c0,t3_mntiy,t1_c32h3c0,t1_c32gq0b,1427924724,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'd also disagree that the debt is not worrying due to the distribution of the maturity. Here is a [post on ftalphaville](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2009/12/11/88586/the-sovereign-northern-rock-funding-model/) showing the UK as more long-term than Germany or the US. The other country held up as having a better distribution is Greece.

If you think UK household debt looks sustainable when house prices are dropping fast then you may be in for a surprise.

Keep your chin up - you'll need it when gas bills hit the mats in January, assuming we don't have any sovereign defaults between now and then.

**edit:** An interesting survey shows that most White Brits tend to label themselves as English, Scottish or Welsh. Where as Non-White Brits tend to label themselves as British.

&gt; Only one-third (34 per cent) of people from the White British group described themselves as British. White British were much more likely to describe themselves as English, Welsh or Scottish. Non-White groups were more likely than White groups to identify themselves as British. Only around 7 per cent of people in the Indian group and 6 per cent of people in the Bangladeshi and the Black African groups described themselves as English, Scottish or Welsh.

As I mentioned, I've been a Rush fan for a very long time.  I had vaguely heard of Doctor Who as a kid but the show wasn't on any TV channels available to me.  I saw the 1996 movie and it didn't do much for me.  

During the last few years I saw bits of some episodes from the last 3 Doctors.  I watched all of season 6, and subscribed to this subreddit.  I realized I was missing out on a lot of background, ongoing story elements, inside jokes, etc.  I decided to catch up so I signed up for Netflix. As of last week I finished all the episodes since 2005.  I'll probably check out some shows from previous decades and of course I'm waiting for the Christmas Special.

it was inevitable that we had to move on from him being the centre of the team and the leader. I think we have a good enough range of talent in the midfield now that we could cope if he never played again, and we don't need him as inspiration so much now.

having said that i desperately want him to be a regular starter and watch the others sit on the bench and see how it can be done. There is no doubt that when he is on the pitch he brings another dimension to the team, but the problem is that the team has to function perfectly without him and the current 'functional' team doesn't really accommodate him, nor can they spend weeks training and playing without him getting their own groove on without them consequences to how well he adapts going back in. In that sense it is hard to see him coming straight back into the team without some of that excellent work being undone.

strangely and sadly i can see him leaving at some point. That is football - Henderson and Shelvey are both potential replacements for the long term. Adam is fine for the next couple of seasons.

But it's interesting to see they're jumping on the ""Teaching sex education is like paedophilia"" bandwagon - Considering that some parents never keep their children ignorant of what sex is actually all about, you wonder why the BNP *et al* have never campaigned to make it law that parents can't explain the birds and the bees when *they* choose. Of course: All such parents are paedos, particularly farmers who probably never shelter their children around the time their animals start breeding. Paedo-farmer scum the lot of them.

 I imagine someone told the BNP about [this recent happening](http://www.humanism.org.uk/news/view/920). I say ""told"" because I doubt they'd have had much like deciphering anything coming out of either House. Too many long words.

If he gave you a 10 day course of antibiotics (standard), you may not feel any relief after 4 days.  But if it's your second course of treatment, you are rightfully concerned that it may not be working.

Also, call the hospital in which you had the surgery and speak to their patient liaison.  There should be an office in every NHS hospital.  Explain exactly what you've said here, how often you've called, how long it took them to return the call, and how you feel he is not interested, and how concerned/worried you are about this.  These people are (typically) not healthcare providers, but they know the system, and they know how to make things happen.

When I dealt with the NHS (as an American organizing care for US service members on the NHS) the patient liaisons were often my best friends.  If they're sympathetic (and not a jobs worth) they can make things happen, quickly.

It's annoying because you can't sit on College Green for your lunch occasionally? From what I see down there, the benches nearer the Marriot are still free. Were you going to be sitting on the grass in November?

Also, why is someone who served in the army automatically a hero and how do you know that there are no veterans in the protest camp itself? Is anyone who attends a protest automatically not-a-hero-and-is-actually-pathetic?

What would you want the protesters to do rather than protest? And given that you are here talking about the protest, is it not in some way successful? I don't know, I haven't spoken to them so I can't be sure of their aims. Have you?

The thing that *is* important is (or rather, the question that *has* been posed before is) _who_ is the Doctor? It was suggested in some episodes with the Fifth and Seventh Doctors (along with some extensive Extended Universe literature) that the Doctor is also the Other, who is one of the three Time Lords who founded Time Lord society. 

Although, the recent series has established that his name burns in the Medusa Cascade, which we know is somehow pivotal to the end of the Time War. This kind of implies that there's some power inherent to his name. I think no one is supposed to know it - a kind of forbidden word of power, if you will. I mean, the Doctor kind of freaked when River whispered his name into his year.

true,greengl0ves,1986,null,"It will be a sad day if AVB is sacked this season. We are creating, scoring and often times leading in matches which is a far cry from the slump last season when goals were hard to come by. The problem is the defence, give the man time to sort it out and build a team around his defensive philosophy. The last thing I want is a new manager to come on board with all these new players we have and then change the entire philosophy yet again.


As much as I love all of the Chelsea legends like Drogsy, Lamps and Terry, at some point we have to move on, and maybe right now AVB is feeling pressured into playing them. Sure, Lamps has got some form back, but I still don't think he should be in there every single week, I'd really like to see more of Meireles to be honest, maybe alongside Ramires. 


It may just be me, but I'd also like to see some faith put into Torres. Allow him to play successively in 3, 4, 5 premier league matches. I thought it was insane playing Drogs in two massive matches after a lengthy ban and a poor start to the season. The front three has been constantly changing and I think it needs some stability with the current players we have, unless we can get them all playing a similar style of football... When you replace Mata with Malouda, the entire dynamic changes, when you replace Torres with Drogs, the entire dynamic changes, etc. I'm confident AVB is trying to get everyone to play the same way, but perhaps its a matter of signing some new guys who fit the mould. 


Finally, I don't think the issues with the defence can be patched with a simple ""play Luiz! no, play Ivanovic! blah blah blah"", it'll be patched once the players learn the system and have trust in eachother and gain confidence, time time time. Whether that be with our captain John Terry or a younger face at CB, I honestly don't know.


Anyway, I'm still pumped for this weekend's match against Wolves! Chelsea 2-1... It wouldn't be a Chelsea 2011-12 match without a goal conceded, right? :)

The main problem with tower blocks historically is that the rent income went to the council who were disinclined to spend it on maintenance. So the buildings became run-down, and a ghetto mentality built up.

Buildings need money spent on them to stay clean and safe, and it was that neglect that made tower blocks seem generically unpleasant. However, most private blocks have security, concierge, cleaners etc - and they are a delight to live in.

They also tend to have rules, so anti-social behaviour is discouraged, which helps to make them a more pleasant place to live..

true,lightsaberon,null,null,"For people too lazy to click (the general article is about neo-liberalism):

&gt;Coming to power in 1979, Margaret Thatcher's political and economic philosophy emphasised reduced state intervention, freer markets, and more entrepreneurialism. She once slammed a copy of Friedrich Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty down on a table during a Shadow Cabinet meeting, saying, ""This is what we believe."" Thinkers closely associated with Thatcherism include Keith Joseph, Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman.

&gt;Thatcher's political and economic philosophy emphasised reduced state intervention as well as free markets and ""entrepreneurialism"". She vowed to end excessive government interference in the economy and attempted to do this through privatizing nationally-owned enterprises. After the James Callaghan government had concluded that the Keynesian approach to demand-side management failed, Thatcher felt that the economy was not self-righting and that new fiscal judgements had to be made to concentrate on inflation. She began her economic reforms by increasing interest rates to slow the growth of the money supply and thus lower inflation. In accordance with her ""less government intervention"" views she introduced public spending cuts particularly on housing and industry subsidies. She also placed limits on the printing of money and legal restrictions on trade unions.

&gt;By January 1982 the inflation rate had fallen to 8.6% from earlier peaks of 18%. By 1983 overall economic growth was stronger, while inflation and mortgage rates were at their lowest levels since 1970. The term ""Thatcherism"" came to refer to her policies as well as aspects of her ethical outlook and personal style, including moral absolutism, nationalism, focus on individuals rather than society as a whole and an uncompromising approach to achieving political goals.

&gt;After the 1983 election, the Conservative majority expanded, Thatcher continued to enact her economic policies. The UK government sold most of the state's large utilities. The policy of privatisation was a main component of Thatcherism. When Thatcher was forced to resign as British Prime Minister in 1990 British economic growth was on average higher than the other large EU economies (Germany, France and Italy). However this was accompanied by poor social conditions compared with the rest of the EU.

&gt;The price of these economic policies was a temporary and dramatic increase in unemployment that embarrassed the Thatcher government so much that the definition of unemployment was changed 31 times in order to come up with lower figures. Despite this, the official rate of unemployment in the United Kingdom increased to 9.1% in the years 1979-89 after it had been 3.4% between 1973–79 and 1.9% between 1960-73.

&gt;In 2001 Peter Mandelson, a Member of Parliament belonging to the British Labour Party and closely associated with Tony Blair, declared that ""we are all Thatcherites now."" In reference to contemporary British political culture it could be said that a ""post-Thatcherite consensus"" exists with regard to economic policy. In the 1980s the now defunct Social Democratic Party adhered to a ""tough and tender"" approach in which Thatcherite reforms were coupled with extra welfare provision. Neil Kinnock, leader of the Labour Party from 1983–1992, initiated Labour's rightward shift across the political spectrum by concurring largely with the economic policies of the Thatcher governments. The New Labour government of Tony Blair has been described as ""neo-Thatcherite"" by some since many of their economic policies mimicked those of Thatcher.

&gt;The coalition government of Cameron and Clegg, that came into office in 2010 has been described as Neoliberal, with neoliberal 'Orange Book' Liberal Democrats playing key ministerial roles.

tl;dr: Thatcher's neo-liberal economics policies are thought to have led to soaring unemployment, whilst enriching a small percentage.  It also led to important national utilities being sold off, arguably, without much benefit to society.  Her legacy has continued, neo-liberalism was significant within the labour party and still is within the conservative and even parts of the liberal democrat parties.",0,1322224949,null,0,false,0,c32mnpz,t3_mou7x,t1_c32mnpz,t3_mou7x,1427927428,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I made that point in another comment you might have seen, but not in the one you replied to. In that one I tried to talk to you. But wouldn't you say it's a tad moronic to assume that being a fan of education means you're a paedo?

As I said elsewhere: By the same reasoning, parents who teach their child *anything* about sex under a set age are therefore perverts or paedophiles. Plus it means that anyone teaching any child under the age of 16 anything about sex should get the same label... Or is there suddenly some magical age where it's *not* paedophilia. 14? 15?

Which were then leveraged and reinvested, directly then indirectly stimulating GDP figures. Labour followed this example in the second wave of privatisation that began in 1997, chasing the money like dogs after the smell of fresh pork. Lazy, greedy fuckers. Although quite an innovative way to mint money at the time. 

And the result, after 30 years of cyclical asset flipping by the revolving door politicians and 'business' people we've let take Britain for an extended joy-ride? I can't really put it better than this: ""Look at our household names: take out retail, banks and commodities and the things you're left with bear names such as Wessex Water or Centrica or Arriva. In other words, they do things the public sector used to do – pump water or pipe gas or lay on public transport. Alternatively, they're outfits such as Serco, or Capita and they're bidding for contracts from the government; or they're engineers bidding for PFI projects. Now look at the big names in America or Germany: there are firms such as Google or Siemens.

Over here much of the private sector isn't adding anything or innovating – indeed, it's tricky to do that when you're running an administrative office or supplying water. They're simply taking contracts and cutting staffing costs.

This is a picture of lazy British business, either seeking business from the state or the protection of sheltered industries. And yet if you listen to the Conservatives, the problem with the economy is that the labour markets are too heavily regulated. No 10 lets it be known that it's taking seriously ideas to scrap laws around unfair dismissal, so that employees can be sacked without explanation.""

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"Tax avoidance does *not* cost the UK economy anything. And are you sure you meant 'economy' and not 'Treasury'?

Tax avoidance is the perfectly legal use of tax legislation to pay no more tax than you are legally obliged to.

The legal definition is:

&gt;Tax Avoidance: The process whereby an individual or organisation plans his, her or its finances so as to apply all exemptions and deductions provided by tax laws to reduce taxable income.

Failing to pay tax that you are legally obliged to pay is called *Tax Evasion*.

Working out how much *Tax Avoidance* 'costs' the State is purely arbitrary. Which tax 'loopholes' do you close, which do you leave open, and which do you alter?

A self-employed plumber who buys a van for his business will deduct the cost of that van from his tax obligation. Will you stop this particular 'loophole' or not?

A business that donates a very substantial percentage of its profits to charities, in return for a tax reduction, which costs the tax payer far less than it would to support the work of that charity through state funding... do you stop that?

My point is, there are literally thousands of ways an individual or company can use the tax system to reduce their tax burden. Many of them in a very beneficial way to society and the economy.

For example, if I invested a certain amount of my earnings in the British film industry, the government will give me a tax reduction on that money. This helps the British film industry survive using private rather than state money, costing the tax payer far less (a tax break rather than using state money to prop-up the industry. It also actually *contributes* to the economy). What I am not doing is 'cheating' the system. I'm doing exactly what the fucking government wanted me to do.

So there really is no actual figure as to how much Tax Avoidance costs, because none of the money saved through tax avoidance was rightfully the government's anyway.",0,1322234795,null,0,true,0,c32nbk8,t3_motbv,t1_c32nbk8,t3_motbv,1427927734,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

If you can't be bothered then what's the point of even telling us, except to make us all aware that you're a world weary misunderstood but necessarily correct individual? Hence the martyr poke: You want us to know that you know better but are too pained to let us know how.

Too much assuming on your part, which I'm sure I can understand, but why don't you ignore the backslappers and speak to **me** as I'm the one here asking you questions?

It's imperative that we play with the same 'closing down' mentality we had against Chelsea except we need Suarez to be more clinical when he has the chance to create a chance or convert one. Bellamy, Maxi, Johnson and Enrique should cause the city full backs so many problems.

Adam should be good enough to carry and move play into the City final third, it's important he doesn't get caught in possession or leave to too much space in behind himself otherwise Silva will get too much time. As for Lucas, he's the big game man, I expect to see him extinguish a few attacks. We've got a strong defense we just need to be more clinical upfront and not allow any mistakes at the back.

true,formerly_LTRLLTRL,1953,"#25","Atmosphere at Leverkusen was fantastic.  We sang our hearts out for 90', and from speaking with some of the German fans after the match, we impressed them, especially as they were fucking LOUD.  Every one of us stayed and clapped the few players who came over.

Sunday vs. Liverpool was standard atmosphere at the Bridge.  The noise came from the ends, as per usual.  Liverpool fans made the most noise, but I challenge you to find me a ground in the top flight where the away fans DON'T make more noise.  It's simple, your more passionate fans will make the trip, and every club has their ""tourist supporters.""  Given the price of a ticket in the West or the East, you're not going to attract the passionate fans that would sit in either end.  

The supporters are not the problem.  We've turned up and made ourselves heard.  We made the trips across Europe to have our hearts broken late.  We'll be there tomorrow, singing before, during, and after, because that's what we do.

As an aside, those of you (and I include myself in this category) who live abroad and are lucky enough to be able to make 1 or 2 trips (or none) a year, are a bit out of touch.  We'll pay the £50-£80 ticket prices because it's a holiday for us.  That much for your average supporter going week-in week-out is asking a LOT.  As a consequence, it's tough to get consistency.  The East and West stands are filled with people who can afford those tickets.

I was a regular commenter on r/soccer and r/chelseafc up until a month or so ago, when I had had enough with the overall quality of the reddit ""community"" (and that phrase, which is totally bogus.  Reddit is no more a community than YouTube.  It is a collection of people on the internet, with some who share common interests in an anonymous world).  I made this account to comment on this post specifically, because I think it is a misplaced sentiment.  With everything going on at Chelsea right now, the one aspect that does not deserve to be criticized is the support, evidenced by those 1500 of us who took a flight and 2 trains to turn up and sing our hearts out for our men in blue in Leverkusen, only to have our hearts broken and still applaud the team and turn around and sing during the trip home.",0,1322242258,null,0,false,0,c32o4jy,t3_mnyh3,t1_c32o4jy,t3_mnyh3,1427928110,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

No drugs directly cause the use of another drug, but they are allegedly gateways.

There is no real evidence about causation and correlation for any of the gateway argument, but if you're going to look at the concept I would suggest those three are likely to be taken before weed.

And from the wikipedia page for the English equivalent:

&gt; In the absence of such a rule it might be difficult for an unpopular person to obtain legal representation, and barristers who act for such people might be criticised for doing so.

&gt; In 1999, Lord Irvine, the then Lord Chancellor, said: ""The ""cab rank"" rule is one of the glories of the Bar. It underscores that every member of the Bar is obliged, without fear or favour, to represent clients who offer themselves, regardless of how unpopular they may be in the community or elsewhere.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cab_rank_rule

In other words, I imagine her conscience said to her (all those years ago when she became an advocate) something like, ""I believe that in a good justice system everyone has the right to competent representation, and I am thus prepared to join this system, and do my duty by it, even if it means I sometimes have to make ridiculous arguments on the behalf of some right shits.""

She should thus play every card she's professionally able to. If she didn't she would be failing the justice system.

A woman has told a court how a male police officer handcuffed her to a window in a ""crucifix position"" - then wrapped sticky tape around her head.

Arlene Pattie said she was ""humiliated"" by the actions of Tayside Police officer George Stewart.

The incident is said to have taken place in the office of East Port House bail hostel in Dundee, where she works.

PC Stewart, 35, and fellow officer Shirley Tindal, 39, deny assaulting Mrs Pattie on 20 July 2010.

Dundee Sheriff Court heard Mrs Pattie had been on duty at the hostel, in Dundee's King Street, when she was told police were coming to arrest a resident.

Mrs Pattie said PCs Stewart and Tindal - whose addresses were both given as care of Tayside Police HQ in Dundee - arrived earlier than expected and she told them which resident they were to arrest.

She said she then told PC Stewart the resident had been complimentary of him after the woman had made an allegation of a sexual assault that was dealt with by him.

Mrs Pattie said Stewart then replied: ""Are you checking up on me?""


'Absolutely petrified'

Seconds later she said he grabbed her by the wrist and handcuffed her - before attaching that handcuff to a window overlooking the busy street below.

She said PC Steward then asked PC Tindal: ""Let me see your cuffs.""

Mrs Pattie said PC Stewart returned and grabbed her other arm - and claimed he twisted it up her back before cuffing it to the other side of the window.

End Quote Arlene Pattie

She said she had been placed in a ""crucifix"" position with her hands above her head. Mrs Pattie told the court she was ""absolutely petrified"" by the officer's actions.

""He was sitting on the desk playing with the roll of tape. He then started rolling it round my head,"" she said.

""It was down over my nose - that was what frightened me the most. The tape came to the top of my lip. I was completely humiliated.""

Advocate Susan Duff, defending PC Stewart, asked Mrs Pattie if she had been ""flirting"" with Stewart.

She asked: ""Isn't it the case that what took place in that office was just a carry-on between two consenting adults?""

Mrs Pattie replied: ""That is so untrue. I vomited and became hysterical when they left.

Wrist 'indentations'

""When the tape was around my face I made it very obvious that I was distressed.""

Mrs Duff asked if it was the case that her glasses had been falling off while she was handcuffed - and that Stewart had simply offered to ""Sellotape them back on"".

Mrs Pattie answered: ""That's absolute nonsense.""

Mrs Duff asked if Mrs Pattie had been ""consenting"" to Stewart handcuffing her and taping her.

She replied: ""I would never allow myself to be handcuffed and taped up in such a way at my place of work.""

The court was shown pictures of Mrs Pattie's wrists following the alleged attack - which appeared to show deep indentations in her wrists, apparently caused by the handcuffs.

Her initial economic plan was monetarism, the core beliefs of which are that:

a) you can control the money supply

b) the money supply is directly linked to inflation (i.e. an increase in the money supply will inevitably lead to an increase in inflation)

What actually happened:

a) She failed to control the money supply

b) There wasn't an accompanying rise in inflation

c) There was an overvalued pound, an extremely deep recession with reduced investment and a massive increase in unemployment (hence b)

She therefore completely undermined the whole basis for her financial policy, clearly demonstrated its key axioms to be wrong, while causing huge social deprivation; whole communities with generations of unemployment, crime and drug problems, which ended up adding to the cost of the state.

BT doesn't own any mobile phone licences (they haven't since they sold what became O2 in 2001) - can't blame them for not doing anything that would require one.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; We all know how to solve the gang problem, legalise drugs and you get ride of a giant black market that fosters and funds the majority of gangs. 

A legalized, tax and regulated drugs trade would do the country some good, but not as much as you would think. While it would work for pot, it's a relatively high volume, low margin business compared to the trade in powders and pills. And I don't think we're going to solve any problems by legalizing the trade in the more destructive drugs such as crack, heroin, crystal meth or cocaine. If anything I would simply regulate the sale of weed in the same manner as booze is regulated, decriminalize the harder stuff and target the police on dealing with unlicensed dealers and the associated slave trade (endemic in weed production). Then harder drugs could be treated as a purely medical/social issue rather than criminalizing sick people. 

But then drugs aren't the only cause of gang violence. Things like London's post code gangs, which quite honestly I cannot fathom, or sectarian football violence in Scotland for instance. They are decidedly more complex issues.

&gt; The vast majority, particularly those who actually vote, still get their information from the mainstream. I don't have a candidate in the country that you wouldn't likely rubbish, UKIP for example, but I expect you know about Ron Paul in the states. There is nothing particularly revolutionary about his ideas at all, but he is often refused a platform, asked less questions in debates when he is there and generally marginalised by the established press. Occupy had some reasonable ideas but most people have never heard them.

The vast majority don't vote. And this is a far bigger problem. TBH, I would simply make election day into the entire weekend or make it a public holiday where people are allowed to take time off work to vote by law and the pubs cannot open. 

As for UKIP, I don't like them. As someone who is a British European, not English they really have no appeal to me. And I'm a liberal, not a conservative so I'm not buying what they're selling. 

Ron Paul has some interesting ideas (in a good and bad way), but I honestly don't think he would make a good leader. His role, and the position he is good at, is being an opposing voice. You might not think it's important, but it really is. He is one of the few people in power who can say what he thinks and get away with it, he knows he'll never be in office so he doesn't have to worry about being all things to all people, and that is a powerful role (although maybe he doesn't realize this). As for how he is treated in the press, and during the debates, that is a shame. But then this isn't America. We have a far more vibrant political dialog compared to them, and minority parties (and factions within the bigger parties) do get a lot more air time than they would in the US.

As for Occupy, they have some reasonable ideas, but they also have idiots in masks and some stupid ideas. And they don't seem to realize when they have good ideas, and when they should dump the people playing dress up in the Thames.",0,1322254767,null,0,false,0,c32pr5p,t3_mom10,t1_c32pr5p,t1_c32o7uo,1427928875,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In their effort to prevent workers from being laid off, the unions as a side effect cling to lower quality services that use outdated technology. In that sense, yes, unions have a negative impact on the services consumers use, but they have a duty to protect their workforce, who need their jobs *to live*. As far as unions are concerned that is the most important thing, and I think as humane individuals that should be the most important thing to us too. It'd be nice to have cake and eat it - for upgrades to occur, and for all workers to be kept on at the same wage but for hours reduced proportional to the time saved by the upgrades.

How was the Amy who left in the TARDIS any different than before the episode? What did we learn about her that we didn't know previously?

Nothing. As I said it wasn't terrible, I agree that old Amy was somewhat interesting, but there was really nothing but cliche Amy really loves Rory moments.

Not exactly. There are plenty of aspects of new Amy that are completely irrelevant to the character. Her bitterness and anger and having been abandoned and spending her entire life in isolation? Got a lot of screen time but not really a revelation or a surprise - nor is it at all relevant going forward. The only big ""revealing"" emotional moments were new Amy's moments with Rory which, while cute, did little to advance the character. Yes shes a badass who loves Rory. And Rorys a total badass who loves Amy. We see this every week. 
If so much was revealed about her character, why not just say what it was?

If you still believe any are wrong then please point out some citations to back up what you are saying. Bullet Points 3 and 4 are covered in points 20 and 13-thru-16 respectively in [this document](http://www.acas.org.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=1041). The rest are covered there also but I have better things to do than cross-reference everything for you. 

As for folk with less than one years service, I never said anything about them. But the safe and common thing to do is to follow the standard process because it's actually pretty sensible and fair for all involved. Where the law does differ is in the employees ability to bring the company to a tribunal; the list of allowed topics is much shorter for someone with less than 12 months service. If their performance was adequate then they can easily bring up their dismissal as a matter of personal discrimination. If the company had followed the standard process their ass would be completely covered. Which is why almost all of them do follow it.

The big question is if you should start at the 2005 relaunch or jump to the most recent Doctor in 2010 which also feels like a relaunch.

Neither require any foreknowledge. The latter is shinier with better special effects and more consistent writing. But if you do that you'll miss out on the awesome that is the 2005-2009 series. You won't get to see the show or Doctors develop.

It depends on how forgiving you are of tv shows. 2005 was the show's first year so it was still finding it's feet.

I'd say try and start at 2005. If you're wavering a bit, jump forward and watch an episode called Blink (pre-2010) to help. And if it still isn't working, just jump to 2010.",0,1322279247,null,0,false,0,c32sqtg,t3_mpiu4,t1_c32sqtg,t3_mpiu4,1427930366,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5
true,[deleted],null,null,"I'll give you a quick very simple run down of how to buy something, sell it for £200 more than you paid from it, make a real profit of over £60 but an actual accounting loss on paper...

Used amateur radio transceivers. The adverts for them on the various forums all pretty much state collection only due to their size and supposed fragility and the fact most hams are in their 60's and probably not able to or don't want the hassle of parcelling up so you can't even arrange a courier collection. 

So a typical deal from start to finish would go like this:

Purchase price £800. 200 mile round trip to collect it. Sell it on Ebay for £1000. Profit excluding expenses is £200. A 20% profit margin which is quite reasonable. OK so far?

Expenses:

* Ebay and Paypal fees approx 10% so £100

* Mileage at HMRC rates of 45p per mile so £90.

* Packaging and postage is £13.


So on paper, we've actually made a net LOSS of £3. However because we have a car that does 50MPG and we claim fuel at HMRC rates, its only cost us around £25 to collect it, not £90 so the real actual paid out in cash expenses are £138, not £203. So the physical profit you can put in your bank is £65. But HMRC aren't interested in that for tax, its the amount after claimable expenses at HMRC rates. And on the above, there's a net loss of £3.

Also that he is secretly good friends with the current head writer, and guides the story lines. Maybe the Doctor saw where the series was going to go, and then convinced them to use a terrible script, and bad actors, only to get a good actor to play himself, as he didn't want something worse than Colin Baker on his reputation.

My second language I'm learning is German. The TARDIS would translate English for me because if it did German I would be wondering *Why German??* So English it is.

As for the Doctor, English or Gallifreyan. He knows lots of languages, he doesn't need a translator. But seeing as he talks to Madame Du Pompadour in French (from her POV) and he's speaking english from our POV, he's probably going Gallifreyan. But it doesn't matter because the TARDIS would probably translate multiple different languages for all the people in a conversation anyways. So really, there's no way of knowing.

I think the thing with Pompeii was a bit of writing discontinuity. Maybe what Donna said was grammatically incorrect or what she said differed from her intended meaning so it came out funny. After all, if the TARDIS translates anything, it probably translates based on a person's intended meaning versus literally- since all translation is just interpretation anyways. It also explains the Doctor's usage of British vernacular.

I'm not sure about sign language. I bet if it was written in, the character wouldn't understand each other, but logic dictates that the meaning would be inserted into one's mind telepathically. As for the Hath, I don't know why. Perhaps their brainwaves or their understanding of concepts is too alien to translate.

What if Time Lords inherently have the same 'programming,' if you will, as the TARDIS? Perhaps the Doctor can speak every language as part of his Time-Lordy-ness, but speaks the language that his companions are most comfortable with?

You're fluent in both? Oh I'm envious! Which one do you naturally think in? Sometimes when people become very angry, they'll start shouting in their ""natural"" language no matter how good they are at whichever one they commonly use. Have you ever flipped out and started shouting in a particular language? It's probably that one.

Well, seeing as the entire conversation was all in English from our point of view (whether it was actually French or Gallifreyan) we don't really know what combinations of languages it was in. It could've been all in French, or Gallifreyan-French, or English-French, or heck any other language the Doctor knows plus French.

I don't know of any hints toward Time Lords automatically knowing all languages. Based off the book Lungbarrow (which seems to be the only piece of media that tells one a *lot* about Gallifrey- questionable canonicity or not), Time Lords are a bit xenophobic.

true,SilentStarryNight,tardis,TARDIS,"Sometimes the best way to figure out how something works is by observing it when it does not work, or at least working very poorly. I'd like to see a ""Darmok"" type episode, in which it does but does not work, and the characters have to learn how to translate for themselves.  I understand in the UK, Ireland, and throughout Europe it is very common to be able to at least understand more than one language, even to be able to communicate (nearly) interchangeably in two or maybe more languages.  This is something most of us yanks are still learning, as the only experience with language learning most obtain comes from school classes and promptly forgotten, or restaurant menus. Such an episode could illustrate just how important it is to at least be able to think in a completely different form, which is the goal of learning a new language.

I would like to think, if the TARDIS could pick up on the fact that one of its entrants knows 2 languages fluently, it would use both in translation of other languages to theirs, as any human multilingual translator or interpreter could do. I know someone who grew up speaking and reading Mandarin Chinese with his family,  yet thanks to his growing up in the USA, speaks English fluently, and majored in Spanish at university.  I myself speak both English and Spanish fluently. If I visited his family, he could translate his family's ideas to me using both English and Spanish, whichever has the closest words to the idea. 

I would hope the Doctor in all his years and travels had taken the time to really learn the languages he frequently encounters.  As we know, his particular TARDIS is not exactly ""top of the line"", so if that little circuit were to malfunction at a very inopportune time, he would be in a lot of trouble.  I know from living in a nation and culture not my own that even just a ""meet you halfway"" gesture with language can be very useful and necessary in making friends.

I think it would make for a very amusing (and poignant) sketch to have the TARDIS translate sign language, as it requires the full movement of the arms, hands, head and face.  Those not fluent would fund themselves being used as marionette and ventriloquist puppets in order to convey themselves properly, and the person signing would be given a voice that the TARDIS itself made up.  In the US, if a character on TV (and movies too, i believe) is Deaf, then the actor playing that character also must be Deaf, and i hope that would be the case in the UK too, so that it would not be demeaning to the Deaf people watching.

Their flippancy and sheer disregard for the death and destruction occuring around them was more than a little irritating, and really didn't help me 'warm' to Tennant's Doctor. *The Girl in the Fireplace* would help bring Rose and the Doctor back on form, but *Rise of the Cybermen/The Age of Steel* and its horrifying opening sequence would see them driven to new lows.

Rose's bitchy and possessive behaviour around Sarah Jane in *School Reunion* did the character no favours, either. Her reaction if she ever meets Eleven/River will be entertaining to say the least.

Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anhthing so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see as a final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.

""Oh that was easy"" says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.

I should probably note before I get too far into my Martha rant that it's been awhile since I've seen Season Three - I wasn't a big fan of it the first time I saw it, and I haven't cared enough to see it as a whole since.

So, pretty much from the start, Martha was set up as the ""New Rose"" - as the second lead companion it was essentially her job description. One of the major parallels between the two characters is their romantic attraction to the Doctor. But rather than warming to his new travelling companion fairly quickly - as with Rose - he agrees to take her on two trips: one to the past and one to the future. And so, right from the start we get a taste of the slight disregard the Doctor shows to Martha which ultimately comes to a head in Human Nature/The Family of Blood. 

There's a sense throughout that Martha's just not quite good enough to replace Rose, and it's this glorification of Rose that first started to get to me - Martha never really got a chance to be a truly great companion because only Rose can be special.

I should state that - even though I really like to rant about Rose - I actually did like her in Series 1 and 2.

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"No, I disagree that it's a good measure on average.

BMI uses the square of the height, and compares this to mass, and argues that there aught to be a correlation there, therefore people with more mass are overweight.

We're all aware that, because it doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat, more muscled people are incorrectly labeled as overweight.

The problem is that the square of a linear quantity is an _area_, not a _volume_, and it's not difficult to see that a measure that was more directly sensitive to volume would be a better approximation to mass than a area.

In short: it aught to use height cubed, not height squared, for the base approximation. Because it does not, it becomes poorer the further one is in height away from the initial conditioning data.

That's why it doesn't work so well for people who are taller than averag e (or smaller). 

I would note, however, that the BMI was developed in 1830 to 1850; and it's not hard to show that people are taller now than they were.  This is one reason that BMI is not a good measure - it fails to account for this general change in height.

None of this detracts from it's utility in comparing populations, provided that the populations are of the 'same' height (i.e. same average, and same distribution).  Unfortunately, it's also not difficult to show that this doesn't hold (e.g. the Dutch are the tallest nation in Europe etc).

Frankly, there's enough (unnessecary) uncertainty in the measurement technique that it taints any research that relies on it.

 - Vehicle safety questions (25x questions) 
 - Your general driving ability (mandatory Emergency Stop)

 - Independent driving (""Drive me to X,"" follow road signs, or they will ask you to follow a series of directions which require the use of road signs - 10 minute duration)

If you want to compare the number of overweight people in the Netherlands with those in Japan, the survey methodology will find that the Dutch are much more obese than the Japanese.

This does not reflect reality; due to the very different heights of the two populations.

Do note that this survey relies on the binning of people into groups by BMI bands, and then comparing relative occupation of the bands.  That's fundementally flawed for comparing populations, given the weaknessed of the BMI.

If you were going to use BMI, without binning, and then show the _distributions_ of BMI were distinct, then you could maybe show something.  However, the 'true' binning points between different populations aught to be in slightly different places, due to the height related differences.

That being said, I am actually buying more kit from smaller stores online, which means that the profit is staying local, just not local to me. So in reality the small business you want to see more of are doing OK, but they aren't staying local to me.

From my experience of cyclists as a pedestrian and not a driver is that on the whole they seem to have an inflated sense of importance where their right of way is concerned.

My original point is still valid as far as I see..if a cyclist is riding on the pavement he does NOT have a right of way and should not be asking me to move out of the way. This has happened to me on several occasions, and when I have said I will not move or wait til he passes then the abuse starts.

Likewise, when they approach a redlight, they should not mount the pavement and weave through pedestrians. I agree completely with treating them as a give way sign... I do not agree with cyclists causing a hazard to those on the footpath and/or pavement in order to shave a minute off their journey and wait until the road is clear.

There will be some cyclists, such as yourself, who respect drivers and pedestrians and the road and are not rude to other people.

Last summer I was in Cyprus. Cyprus is a popular tourist destination, so it's cool to use places like this for studying the difference between cultures. One thing I noticed is that the english people I met really don't exercise. Sorry, I'll correct myself, english *adults* really don't exercise. And I don't mean finding the hotel gym and staying in there all week. I mean just having physical activity as a normal part of their life. It was always germans I was playing volleyball with. And a couple of young girls from Surrey or something. Swimming and diving into the sea, it was again, Germans, plenty of french adults, couple of russians I hung out with, seeing how far back we could jump to still reach the water (fucking mental).

Yet whenever I ran in to a british couple or british family, the parents would be the ones out early at breakfast (one guy the living embodiment of a british stereotype; union jack swimming shorts, lager for breakfast and a gut) and sunbathing the majority of the day. Physical activity just never seemed to be something any of the brits I met would do for *fun*. 


Now, I'm FULLY aware that this is not the case for likely millions of british adults (note: I'm 22), myself included. But there was a definite trend.

So how do we get the british interested in fun physical activity? Is it that our secondary education PE requirement drives the fun out of it? Is there not enough funding in sports initiatives?

true,nonpareilpearl,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt;First of all, if someone speaks more than one language, how does the TARDIS know which to translate it to? Their first language? Their second? The most predominately used? I speak two languages, and it always makes me wonder what the TARDIS would translate things into for me.

Probably the most comfortable. Depending on the individual's level of familiarity with language, there may be some [code switching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching) going on - especially if a concept is more directly expressed in one language over the others.

&gt;In the episode where he and Donna went to Pompeii, she tried speaking Latin, and apparently it came up as some indecipherable Gaelic. 

I think I saw someone else on here make a mention of that and I saw a pretty good answer: she didn't actually know what she was saying, so the TARDIS translated it so the other person didn't know what she was saying either. Assuming the TARDIS did actually choose Celtic, as the vendor indicated, it may very well be that the TARDIS translated vendi, vidi, vici into that language correctly.

&gt;What about non-auditory languages like sign language? Do you think the TARDIS can translate that as well?

I don't know how she'd handle those, although I think someone else's answer about just sending the concepts straight through was a good explanation. Or maybe the TARDIS is so advanced that you wouldn't see them moving their hands and you'd just hear your native tongue (or see it, as the case may be). I would see this as being similar to hearing everyone speak English *and* seeing their mouths move to form English words. (As opposed to just hearing English and seeing their mouths form the words from their own language.)

&gt;...he's been speaking Gallifreyan his entire life...

He may choose to speak Gallifreyan sometimes, but I don't think that he is supposed to be speaking Gallifreyan when we see him. I seem to recall there being a reference to Gallifreyan not translating (the Doctor's cot, the writing River Song uses to get his attention on the ""black box"" for the Angels two parter from S5). This, to me, would make sense for security purposes. You wouldn't want your native language necessarily translated for everyone to understand, especially if there could be potential enemies in hiding nearby. (This, of course, doesn't mean he's necessarily speaking English either - just something translatable.)

&gt;...the ""Hath""...

It's possible that their language can't be translated into English properly, so if the individual being translated for can only speak English then that would be a limitation I guess. This reminds me of the ""impossibly old"" writing from the Impossible Planet two parter from S2 - that didn't translate either (although perhaps for a different reason).",0,1322320906,null,0,true,0,c32vu3a,t3_mpmub,t1_c32vu3a,t3_mpmub,1427931824,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

However, once they hit that point, it's rapidly downhill from there. We all hit the peak of our lives in our 30s, but for athletes, being physically exceptional is all they know.

The only controversy should be between Defoe and VDV, and I still prefer the Dutchman. 

Defoe doesn't create anything, doesn't hold the ball up that well, doesn't have the touch of Adebayor, etc. He is not a #9. He was invisible for the entire game until his goal. He's the type of player who can just come out of no where and score a brilliant goal which is why I think starting on the bench isn't such a bad thing for him. He'll get his starts for sure when VDV is hurt or rested. 

Say what you want about Ade but he bagged two goals and an assist today which puts the # of goals he's either assisted or scored up to 13, much higher than any other player on our team.

The [interview in yesterday's Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/nov/25/david-cameron-answers-questions) just illustrated to me how out of touch he is.

He started that by saying how his parents ""sacrificed a lot to give [him] a great education"", so I went off to learn more about his family, and they seem (at least) quite wealthy. I could understand a lorry driver sending his kid to private school being described as ""sacrificing a lot"", but Cameron's dad was a senior partner in a firm of stockbrokers which has been in the family for generations; he had another directorship and was himself born in the family stately home. On his mother's side, Cameron's grandfather was a baronet.

When Cameron is asked in that interview ""what would you do if you had a majority?"", he talks about welfare reform - cutting the support to those more needy and less privileged than himself.

Paul Weller was ""incredulous"" that Cameron said he enjoyed The Jam's *The Eton Rifles* and said that he couldn't have understood the lyrics. If I'm understanding the song correctly it's about class-warfare, and the impotence of the working-class against the power of the established rich - yet Cameron says it's just ""taking the piss"" out of the posh Etonians.

Some of his answers in that interview are just smarmy politicking, some are blatant lies (cannabis criminalisation), some just made me angry, but I suspect that he genuinely has no idea what it's like not to be able to depend on family wealth, no empathy for those who haven't benefitted from the kind of leg-ups that he's spent his life receiving. How can you separate that out, when his actions as PM, and the bills he supports through parliament, will surely reflect his life experiences?

I don't give a toss what kind of ""leader"" he is whilst he promulgates wealth inequality, and that just seems to be his agenda. He probably believes that ""they're all sponging off us"", but in his case ""us"" is people with generations of wealth and blue-blood.",0,1322330324,null,0,false,0,c32wtzg,t3_mpw3t,t1_c32wtzg,t3_mpw3t,1427932292,42,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,42

You've totally missed the whole point. They are the best in the world at what they do. If you aren't the best, then you don't take part. Almost every profession in the world has awards for people who excel in their fields. Why should sports be any different? They want to be the best of the best, and this is the stage on which they can prove it.

Perhaps your rage is to do with the fact that people can't perform at this level to the same age that you can in other professions. Everyone has a shelf-life, which changes depending on the job you do. That's life, and there is nothing anyone can do to change it.

&gt; However, you listed fencing, rowing, hockey, cycling, as well. This aren't really included in my rant because they all have real life applications.

WTF are you talking about? What are the real life applications of hockey, cycling, rowing, or fencing that set them apart from running? I certainly spend more time running than I've ever done playing hockey, rowing or dueling with rapiers.

I understand that the Olympics don't represent anything to do with progress. But neither does art, fictional literature, music or film.

true,happyblanchy,yorkshire,A Dubliner in Donny,"&gt;Cameron at worst will be looked on by history as bland.

Though I'm not left wing and don't normally consider my remarks as ""sensationalist"", I'm interested in your thinking behind this.

  He's been overseeing some of the sharpest cuts to the income of the poorest and least able of this country since Margaret Thatcher.  His management of the economy is a shambles - Stagflation, the worst possible scenario has become a reality under his leadership.   Alongside that, he seems almost certain to be the man who finally deals a death blow to one of the finest institutions of this country; the NHS.  

I suppose the ultimate test of his tenure will be does he leave this country in a better or worse place for the majority of people.  I'm not confident that people will look back on the early years of this decade and think ""Thank God we had David Cameron at the helm.""

Labour seem to be completely away with the fairies with some of their ideas, and it was their ridiculous, and arbitrary ""50% in higher education"" goal that got Britain where it is today with regards to Uni.

Pushing a load of non-academics through university to study arts and media at massive cost to the tax payer is ridiculous and wasteful. Labour essentially resented that wealthier people went to university, and so made it so the lower classes could too. and good for them. However 50% is FAR too high.

What Labour should have done is opened up equally respectable, but more easily accessable routes into employment. I.e Apprenticeships. which are fantastic alternatives to higher education, and give the student skills they can work with, and also be proud of.

As for cuts to the NHS, I happen to come from a medical family and the true scale of the NHS disaster is hidden from the public for obvious reasons.

First off. I love the NHS. I will never say people should have to pay for healthcare. NEVER. However, the bureaucracy of the NHS needs RADICAL reform. specifically with the whole PCT arrangement. There are too many fat cats in the NHS who do very little and cause a lot of problems, many of these fat cats are in the royal college of nurses (which is why the RCN is lobbying against cuts).

People talk about privatisation of hospitals as a bad thing. But they should keep in mind that in general practice, the vast majority of surgery's are privately owned, and are much more efficient than state ones. All that will be changed are the economists within the hospitals, and the same standards will be kept.

Finally, as to job losses. That can be simply explained. People who will lose their jobs in the NHS (which is relatively few) are people who should have never been given those jobs in the first place.

I don't watch BBC to see Americans acting, or American writers, or American producers or directors.  I watch it because it's not American. I get enough of the plastic made-in-china fakeness that we've built our society on (not saying England is doing any better, I don't know really, but it seems a world away from Los Angeles). 

It was sad to watch the ""Americanized"" version of Torchwood go this route, it was horrifyingly gruesome and violent, far beyond anything the show had done before. I sensed the American influence quite a bit in this last season and it was a disappointment. The story was interesting but they went too far with the gore and gratuitous violence and sex. Fine, it wasn't my cup of tea, but did anyone think ""Americanizing"" Torchwood was a good thing?

I notice the BBC trying to expand more and more into America these days, and it worries me that they would sell out Doctor Who and ""Americanize"" it to make a few dollars/euros. Thankfully though, this Tom Hanks scare was in the mid 90's and not recent, but with all the trips to America lately, and the sell-out of Torchwood, the direction the BBC is taking is starting to worry me a little.

Nobody is being forced to participate in or celebrate Christmas, after all. There's no law dictating that all immigrants must adopt British traditional holidays. They are free to practice their own customs (short of anything that may break our laws) and they have come to this country because of that reason in many cases.

So that they can “safely” rent with exposure to inflation ? Their real mortgage debt liability is getting lower by 5 % per year and the bigger the house the better! You know that. Everybody knows that. As long as people can afford the interest payments (which are historically low so that is not so difficult) they stay. You get a chance on a 20 % drop only when people are forced out. That last situation means a severe slash in the UK economy – and then most likely the banks won’t have the stomach to give you a loan.

**Aaron fucking Lennon**

He's crossing has been so much better than usual.  He has so much pace, and I've heard from other Spurs players he is by far the fastest player on the team (over Bale).  He drew the first penalty and was an absolute menace the entire time.

/bracesforevenmoredownvotes

I love (read: LOVE) when Bale and Lennon switch positions.  They are both so deadly when they switch on to their dominate foot and give themselves such a great position to get off a good shot.  It hurts in moving the ball up, as Bale in particular has trouble moving down that left side, but I think the 4-5 chances we get out of it are enough to merit doing it a few times a game.

I'm not going to change my mind on this. I'm old and stubborn now, and Doctor Who should always be played by a Brit.  

This argument also isn't solely about actors.  Torchwood selling out to Starz opened the door for American actors, but also writers, directors, and money - and money changes things, and it changed Torchwood. The trend I notice with the BBC lately is that they are in Los Angeles in a big way, and trying to court movie deals and TV deals and trying to break into America as much as they possibly can. I've never before seen huge billboards around Los Angeles advertising Doctor Who. It's a new trend.  So is selling out Torchwood to Starz. So is the story about a new Doctor Who movie being made and David Yates is quoted saying ""We want a British sensibility, but having said that, Steve Knowles wrote the Potter films and captured that British sensibility perfectly, so we are looking at American writers too"" [www.dailymail.co.uk article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2061496/Doctor-Who-movie-Harry-Potters-David-Yates-direct-Tardis-big-sceen.html).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; As for cuts to the NHS, I happen to come from a medical family and the true scale of the NHS disaster is hidden from the public for obvious reasons.

I'm not going to defend everything about the NHS, but if you look at the oecd stats it gets good outcomes for relatively little money. That it is a disaster is a strong claim that's going to need a lot of support, and not just 'trust me I know'.

&gt; First off. I love the NHS. I will never say people should have to pay for healthcare. NEVER. However, the bureaucracy of the NHS needs RADICAL reform. specifically with the whole PCT arrangement. There are too many fat cats in the NHS who do very little and cause a lot of problems, many of these fat cats are in the royal college of nurses (which is why the RCN is lobbying against cuts).

I'm not opposed to some reforms, but why *these* reforms. I don't think just slamming everyone who is against these forms as self-interested and greedy (which is what Lansley's dept of health seemed to be doing before the true scale of the opposition became evident) is fair or honest. Lots of people, and not just nurses, have real worries about these reforms.

&gt; People talk about privatisation of hospitals as a bad thing. But they should keep in mind that in general practice, the vast majority of surgery's are privately owned, and are much more efficient than state ones. All that will be changed are the economists within the hospitals, and the same standards will be kept.

&gt;Finally, as to job losses. That can be simply explained. People who will lose their jobs in the NHS (which is relatively few) are people who should have never been given those jobs in the first place. I.e pretty much all PCTs.

The trouble is that there is no evidence that the reforms will actually reduce bureaucracy. I'd wager a good amount that they will actually increase it. You can already see this a bit with the quasi-capitalist ""internal market"" in the NHS - hospitals and GP surgeries will be competing for business, so we'll now have billing departments, and marketing departments (even if they won't be called that), and all the rest that comes with the private sector. Hospitals might have to employ salespeople to convince gp consortia (or whatever they are now to be called) to hire them, and probably lots of lawyers will be required as private companies begin to sue whenever services are commissioned to public hospitals.

And as we are learning, most consortia will have to outsource management to private companies. Those companies are going to need to get paid - is there any evidence whatsoever they'll be cheaper and less bureaucratic?",0,1322343901,null,0,true,0,c32yix0,t3_mpw3t,t1_c32yix0,t1_c32x88a,1427933094,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

6. Scott Parker is a tackleholic

7. ~~BAE~~ (thanks thafman, typing too fast) **Adebayor** makes our attack so 'busy'. He's all over the place, creating space and irritating the shit out of defenders. If only we can figure out how to pay the man.

8. Bale, ah, how lovely to see you back in form. And, playing on the right no less. Your last 3 runs today made me giddy.

9. Defoe's finishing is improving dramatically, and needs just a tiny bit of polish. If he had that, he'd be at 7 goals this year. 

10. As it stands today, Spurs have 4 scorers in the Prem's top 20. No other squad can claim as diverse of an attack as ours. Not United (2 players), not City (3), not Aston Villa (2), and not Arsenal (1).

11. We're in third place, with a *game in hand*. With the right run, and a little luck, second can be reached.

12. Arsenal, the Toon, and Man Utd dropped points today.

13. That's all I can say for now.

I think because people are shorter it is easier to put on weight particularly as you approach middle age.  

when you walk into the Greek supermarkets you do not see much processed foods as you do here in the UK.   I dont think Iceland would survive over there,  not yet.   However a retailer like Lidle  is doing well.   So they are defiantly changing from the balanced Mediterranean diet and adopting more unhealthier options.  More meat, more cheese, more fat, more tin food  - and they fry everything.

They have a fast food store called Goodys.   McDonald is not so popular with  the Greeks.   After trying  Goodys and I would also not bother with McDonald.

Also, whilst cycling in the city I find that I usually get slowed down by cars at some points of my journey. I don't get into a state about this, I just accept it. There will always be other users of the road and it is more than likely that at some point they will slow you down. You could argue that there would be less congestion if more of those who are driving took up cycling.

I also find that many car drivers will take great risks to overtake me, only for me to overtake them further up to road when they get stuck in traffic. People, including cyclists, need to realise that shaving a couple of second off their journey is no excuse to put themselves or others in danger.

This means it will come down to the [tie-breaking criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_UEFA_Champions_League_group_stage#Tie-breaking_criteria).  

1. **Points** *only in the matches between the tied teams*  
We both have 1 point from the first tie, so another tie would keep us level at 2 points each.  

2. **Goal difference** *only in the matches between the tied teams*  
We will still be level on goal difference (0) after two ties.  

3. **Goals scored** *only in the matches between the tied teams*  
Again, we'll have the same amount of total goals scored after two ties.  

4. **Away goals** *only in the matches between the tied teams*  
This is what matters.  

* We have 1 away goal in Valencia, so keeping a 0-0 draw means we have 1 away goal vs their 0, so we'll go through.  
* A 2-2 draw means they have 2 away goals vs our 1, so they'll go through.  

If it's another 1-1 draw, they win because of the next criteria:  

5. **Goal difference** *in all group matches*  
They have +8 compared to our +6.  

Of course, this 0-0 draw scenario assumes Bayer Leverkusen don't lose to Genk.

None of these characters just happen to be American - they were all written that way intentionally, it works as an essential part of all three characters just as the Doctor's background does for him.

 Specifically, there have been hundreds of essays and even books written about the importance of Superman's link to Americana, and his representation of America as a country of immigrants. Spider-Man is as tightly tied to New York City as any character I know of, and Batman is a take-off of the American noir style. 

It's true that they are popular globally, but isn't the whole point of this post that, even though there was a huge market to sell Doctor Who specifically to Americans, it would be wrong to cast an American actor because of the character's essentially British qualities?

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales," I once literally got PAID to take away items at a Waitrose. So here was how it went down:   

 - Fanta, buy two for £1.50 (general offer) (£1.15 each normally) 
 - Two individually discounted Fanta at 35p each (sell-by date issue, last day, double-red tagged).  

For some unknown reason the way the buy two for £1.50 had been done on the till was that it was just a fixed discount of -80p. So you purchased two bottles you got 80p off of your shopping.     

So the receipe looked like this:   

 - Fanta: 35p 
 - Fanta: 35p 
 - Offer - Buy Two: -80p 

Total: -10p.    

The girl working on the checkout literally wanted to give me money and the two bottles. This was all I purchased. I queried it so she called over a manager, who looked over the till log and insisted that I take the 10p. I declined and left with my two bottles.   

PS - I'm fudging the exact figures since it was a few years ago, the actual amount they wanted to give me was around 15p and it might have been three bottles. Waitrose STILL do discounting this way on their tills even to this day. If you look at the receipe you will see they price items then add discounts are two seperate transaction points.

&gt;*They can't just visit Vincient, he needs to fall in love with Amy.* 

Something similar happened with Martha and Shakespeare.

&gt;*With Amy, it's about Amy doing shit with the Doctor tagging along.*

I honestly don't see this in Moffat's Who at all, but I also don't see anything particular wrong with the idea. Let's not forget that the original intention of the show way back in 1963 was to have Ian and Barbara as the main characters, with the Doctor being a grumpy old plot device to get help them from 'Adventure A' to 'Adventure B'.

&gt;*The Doctor isn't the hero any more, he's Amy's imaginary friend.*

I'm struggling to see how this is at all relevant to episodes like *The Impossible Astronaut*, *The Doctor's Wife*, *Closing Time*, or indeed any episode that doesn't reference this piece of dialogue either directly or indirectly. In fact, apart from *The Beast Below*, *The Big Bang* and possibly *The Wedding of River Song*, I can't remember any other episode that revolves around the Doctor being Amy's 'imaginary friend' to the point that it intrudes on the Doctor's 'hero' position within the series.

Amy is really the third 'most important women in all creation' that we've had so far, and even Martha was elevated to ridiculous levels of importance in the Series 3 finale.

Many of these were actually running at a profit. Because of the short timescales involved and the fact she didn't give a shit, nothing was put in place to assist these areas such as retraining. They just paid out redundancy cheques and told people to sign on.

To give you an idea of the impact, in South Yorkshire in 1984 there were 51 collieries. There are only two left. And out of the 49 that closed, 48 of them were under the Conservatives, 34 of them closed under Maggies watch.
14 of them were closed in just over a 12 month period from 1985 to 1986. It is reckoned the closures put over 1/4 of a million people out of work in South Yorkshire.

true,[deleted],null,null,"About 18 months ago, at the Sainsburys in Whitechapel, I had quite a distressing experience.

I was queuing as one does to use the machines when a young girl (guess from looks 14) kicked off and started attacking people. I stepped back with my basket, then her parents appeared and tried to subdue her, but in quite an aggressive manner (she didn't seem capable of verbal communication). By this point I was still waiting in line, but others had fled and staff came to shut the aisle of self serve machines down, so I went to a staffed aisle and queued there. A further 10 mins of waiting and admittedly rubbernecking, the police had turned up because the young girl had defecated and urinated all over herself and was attacking anybody who came close to her. And I mean literally, smearing her own shit all over the floor, the terminals, and attacking all those who came close to her with shit-smeared hands and a banshee wail. I feel awfully sorry for her parents because they appeared very genuine, and must have very hard work caring for somebody I can only assume is heavily autistic or has severe learning difficulties.

On a lighter hearted note, I was in the same place shopping for booze and snacks for a party, scanned through my cheap vodka, crate of beer and cocktail sausages, and after about three minutes, lost patience with trying to flag down staff to authorise the booze purchase, so I set the stopwatch on my phone going and when it hit 10 minutes, just fucked off with the forty quid of items I'd scanned. Really, I'm nearly 30 (and easily look that age), I had my ID out anyway, and my stopwatch had run to 10 minutes despite me beckoning for the attention of every passing staff member, and with an equally impatient queue building behind me tutting at why I'd been standing there for such a long time.

I agree here. They probably did steer away from aliens and try to appeal to Americans. Pretty sure they fudged that one up, though. Should have stuck with what worked. Not sure who's to blame here, maybe it was Starz, maybe it was RTD, maybe it was both.

I think the public in the UK and other countries are sick to death of American re-hashes of their own countries TV shows (why your TV producers think americans can't handle other cultures I don't know) and would not take kindly at all to one of the biggest roles in Britain being exported out to an American (playing the Dr with an American accent)
