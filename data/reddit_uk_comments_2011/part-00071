true,lightsaberon,null,null,"&gt;The problem wasn’t the repeal of Glass-Stegals, the rest of the world always managed without such an act, 

I don't think you know much at all about ""the rest of the world"".  Many countries have or had regulations like the Glass-Stegals act in place to prevent such problems arising.  It was made during the Banking Act of 1933, after the Great Depression to prevent large portions of the banking system collapsing.  Guess what started happening during the credit crunch, oh that's right, collapse of large sectors of the banking system.  

&gt;why would less than a decade of America lacking one be pivotal in the sub-prime mortgage market?

Because that's the time frame in which sub prime mortgages caused the issues which led to the credit crunch.  It's like asking why did the man die several hours after he was shot.

&gt;The point I was making was that there is no one or even small combination of regulations that were repealed that clearly and directly caused the financial crisis, which could equally be blamed on regulations that do exist.

Then why didn't this problem happen sooner?  Why did this problem only happen in America and banks trading in the American market and banks buying investments in the American housing market?  **Where exactly are the non-American sub prime crises?**  The regulations were created to prevent the problems that occurred.  It's like saying repealing a small combination of laws against theft won't lead to theft.  That you further claim such laws would actually cause more theft is idiotic.

**Which regulations caused the credit crunch?**

&gt;Merely deregulating has nothing to do with free market capitalism per se. 

Yes it does.

&gt;Yes, a lack of regulation is essential for free market capitalism but the mere act of deregulating a bit doesn’t mean that the approach taken is a free market capitalist one.

Free market capitalists promote no regulation of the market, ie. deregulation.  They specifically demanded the deregulation of Glass-Stegalls in line with their free market principles.
The banking sector was therefore deregulated in accordance with free market principles.  It wasn't done for fun.  It was done because of pressure from banks and free market economists.  Why would banks demand that they become entrenched in regulations?

&gt;That's all regulations do, especially if we look at it from the perspective of your definition.
&gt;Take for example patents, copyrights and trademarks; these are all regulations, laws that apply to business, and all they do is build up and protect giant institutions (Admittedly they occasionally allow a new player) while raising the barrier for entry, all regulations have this effect, that is why they exist.

This only happened because corporations managed to convince America that they had the same rights as a person.  Look up corporate personhood.  Patents were created to help inventors profit from their inventions and so to encourage invention.  Regulations would be required to prevent corporations from buying patents.

And I really can't believe you think that all regulations are protective.  Does a government regulation on mergers and aquisitions protect giant institutions?  How about an anti-monopoly regulation?

&gt;Because it's vastly more complicated than that hypothetical situation and isn't something that has happened for one year, it's been happening for many, many years. Let us not forget that the West has been artificially raising and supporting its living standards on debt for decades. So while it may appear they have not caught up just yet, the tide has certainly turned towards them and it did so a fair while ago.

Where exactly are you talking about?  Is it China?

And by ""the West"" do you actually mean America?  Or has Sweden and Germany also been living on debt for decades?

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","I'm after someone explaining just why all that you describe is actually a problem within the context of a laissez-faire free-market capitalist economic model. I'm aware that people who believe that laissez-faire free-market capitalism is a failed model for an economy state that it's a problem; however, the people running banks and government appear to think that laissez-fair is a good model.

You are, after all, describing how laissez-faire free-market capitalism copes with the failure of a large business; virtually by definition, people who think this is a Bad Thing are disagreeing with laissez-faire free-market economics, at least as it applies to their interests.

Now, I happen to be in the camp who thinks that laissez-faire free markets only work in the small scale; in particular, they only work in situations where no player has coercive power (financial or otherwise) over the others. Regulation is therefore needed to prevent any market player obtaining that level of power. 

Too big to fail is one form of coercive power; put differently, it states that other players in the market will be forced to pay for any mistake you make that is sufficiently large.",0,1320360735,null,0,false,0,c2wuu7c,t3_lxxmu,t1_c2wuu7c,t1_c2wtshc,1427826634,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If this is so, I would say this over looks the very role law is meant to play in society (I say meant because so often it does bow down to societal norms).  

I would argue that the law is meant to allow for the development of agreed societal aims. Thus, regardless of what society does in practice the law should be attempting to allow for societal goals to be developed, i.e shaping society into what the people would want. Thus I would argue that the overall goal being initiated here is equality and  I would state that this goal is more important than then legislating around a mothers feelings (something that could be dealt with elsewhere maybe via counselling etc). 

Therefore I think that the failure to initiate policy that  ensures a “meaningful relationship with both parents” is contrary to the goal of equality and the procedural burden it may create should be dealt with via regulations and rules not used as an excuse to drop the matter altogether.

&gt;Then why didn't this problem happen sooner?

Because housing debt doesn't explode over night?

&gt;Where exactly are the non-American sub prime crises?

Where exactly are the non-American regulations that force or encourage entry into the sub-prime market?

**All the regulations caused the credit crunch**.  That isn't to say a credit crunch cannot occur sans regulation but it's a bigger problem when you have a system that wears a blind fold and has its hands tied.

&gt;Free market capitalists promote no regulation of the market

Correct, but what actually happened was 'free market capitalists' (In reality they were just pro-corporations, which is different) demanded the deregulation of *one specific regulation* that benefitted the banks.

The banking sector was deregulated in accordance with what the big banks wanted and was about the banks getting a better deal for themselves.

&gt;Why would banks demand that they become entrenched in regulations?

A much better question would be: Why would banks demand a system where their strong profits and market position is constantly threatened by others?

It's important to note that some regulations are not wanted by industries and have *wholly* good intentions, nevertheless they still help to raise the barrier for entry into the market, build up and protect big business.

&gt;This only happened because corporations managed to convince America that they had the same rights as a person. Look up corporate personhood.

This statement is *insane*; all the worlds ills cannot be blamed on America.

&gt;Patents were created to help inventors profit from their inventions *and so to encourage invention*. 

This is a bit of a myth actually, they were created to give inventors a monopoly on their invention nothing more, nothing less.  But because the whole concept is so abhorrent people have tried to reason the idea that it 'encourages innovation and invention'.

&gt;Regulations would be required to prevent corporations from buying patents.

Case in point, if a regulation prevented corporations from buying patents the 'encourage invention' aspect is destroyed as time and resources need to be spent turning the invention into a commercial product, reducing time spent on inventing.

&gt;And I really can't believe you think that all regulations are protective. Does a government regulation on mergers and aquisitions protect giant institutions? How about an anti-monopoly regulation?

What I mean is, they all contribute to building up or protecting or raising the barrier to enter the market (or all of them).  Regulations on mergers and acquisitions, for example, can prevent challengers to the big institutions from existing, even though the idea is to prevent a big business gobbling up all the competition while it is small.

&gt;Where exactly are you talking about? Is it China?

China is one country, yes.  They've moved towards a more free market capitalist system (As well as some other important factors) and they've reaped the rewards.  South Korea and Brazil are also examples.

Or if we want to look at another nation that, while it hasn't caught up by any means, has been transformed through the adoption of more free market capitalist policies we have Chile.

&gt;And by ""the West"" do you actually mean America? Or has Sweden and Germany also been living on debt for decades?

I mean pretty much *all* the non-Soviet European nations, which includes Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the USA et cetera.

I don't have the answers to any relationship problems, but this is a moral crime which for me is akin to rape. I'm using the word very carefully and deliberately here (I'm not intending to sound like someone from r/mensrights) but I feel consent applies to the use of one's sperm for pregnancy just as much as it applies to sexual intercourse. The circumstances differ, of course, but I can't think of any reason to think that it's a more trivial crime.

It sounds like I'm ""godwin""ing the conversation when I say this, but I feel like Liz Jones just admitted herself to have attempted ""rape"", told her readers all about it (because she was **entitled**, dammit!), told her readers that '42% of women would attempt this ""rape""' under similar circumstances, and believes men should be 'wary' lest they be ""raped"" (blaming the victim, anyone?)

true,fatpads,null,null,"My point is I see motive as a major factor in whether I personally consider someone good or evil (obviously it's never so black and white). Hitler's motives were varied, some egotistical - but as far as I understand it he held the genuine belief that what he was doing was the right thing for the world. That to me is a crucial point. To Hitler he was clearing away people that were a detriment to society (as he saw it) and uniting the world under the one great rule (as he saw it). His world view was twisted and demonstrably wrong, but relative to that he was not doing anything evil. He wasn't subverting his morality.

If these people are 'just like anyone' then I'm making the assumption that their world view is largely the same as me and people I've met (limited experience of course). In that world view lying, inciting hatred and fear would seem to be a bad thing to do, yet they do it because it's beneficial to them. That to be seems to be subverting their own morality.

As morality is a largely relative term (things in other cultures/times would seem evil to us here and now but not to those people) I believe you can largely judge a person's 'goodness' by how they act with the morality they have. There's also the question of ""is there an absolute morality?"" which complicates things. If we decide there is then you have to use that too to judge things.

An example. Someone is brainwashed into thinking their neighbour is living a sinful life and should be killed for their own good, to cleanse their spirit. In that person's mind they're doing a good thing by killing their neighbour. To them it's the same as a 'normal' person, say, helping their neighbour fight a drug addiction. We might see nothing morally wrong with making someone go through horrific withdrawal symptoms, maybe even against their will perhaps. However, from a different perspective that might be seen as grossly immoral and no better than torture. So, the act of killing the neighbour might be evil by an absolute morality (if we can define one), but by that person's personal morality - the only thing they have to make judgements - it's a good thing. So how do we judge that person? Evil? Misguided? Good? He was willing to put himself at risk of jail to save his neighbour from sin. Should we take that into account?

Now, I'm not trying to say Hitler was a good man, not at all. I'm just trying to explain where I'm coming from with my previous comment.

true,lightsaberon,null,null,"&gt;Many countries, with highly successful financial markets, did not have a Glass-Stegals Act. Frankly anyone wanting to blame the crisis on the Glass-Stegals Act is having to resort to pure conjecture.

What conjecture?  Glass-stegalls prevented banks from buying other companies.  That's what it was fucking designed to do you imbecile!  How would a commercial bank have merged with investment banks or insurance companies otherwise?  You don't seem to understand what happened at all.

&gt;Because housing debt doesn't explode over night?

Over night?  Are you trolling or just incredibly bad at maths?  1933 - 1990s is hardly overnight!

&gt;All the regulations caused the credit crunch.

So, the regulation to prevent dumping toxic waste in people's water supply is to blame?  Are you a complete troll?

&gt;Correct, but what actually happened was 'free market capitalists' (In reality they were just pro-corporations, which is different) demanded the deregulation of one specific regulation that benefited the banks.

And it was act which allowed the credit crunch to occur.  You seemed to have changed your tone, earlier you claimed moving a little towards free market capitalism is beneficial, but now all of a sudden you're a purist.

&gt;The banking sector was deregulated in accordance with what the big banks wanted and was about the banks getting a better deal for themselves.

Yes, the deregulation was a bad thing.  We agree.

&gt;A much better question would be: Why would banks demand a system where their strong profits and market position is constantly threatened by others?

Why would they be constantly threatened?  Surely you're not completely ignorant about economics?  Yet you argue so adamantly.  Look up game theory.  Why wouldn't banks collude with each other?  How do you think cartels work?

&gt;It's important to note that some regulations are not wanted by industries and have wholly good intentions, 

So, you admit you were wrong.

&gt;nevertheless they still help to raise the barrier for entry into the market, build up and protect big business.

Really, so explain exactly **how does an anti-monopoly regulation ""build up and protect big business""?**

&gt;This statement is insane; all the worlds ills cannot be blamed on America.

What the hell are you talking about?  Where did corporate personhood start?  Again, you reveal your utter and complete ignorance.

&gt;Patents were created to help inventors profit from their inventions and so to encourage invention.

&gt;This is a bit of a myth actually, they were created to give inventors a monopoly on their invention nothing more, nothing less. But because the whole concept is so abhorrent people have tried to reason the idea that it 'encourages innovation and invention'.

Patents originally gave inventors a fixed time period in which to sell their inventions without fear of others simply stealing them.  Why would it have had a fixed time limit otherwise?  If an inventor can't profit from their inventions why bother?  Do you think the rampant piracy in China helps inventors there?

&gt;Case in point, if a regulation prevented corporations from buying patents the 'encourage invention' aspect is destroyed as time and resources need to be spent turning the invention into a commercial product, reducing time spent on inventing.

Spending zero time on inventions is obviously worse than spending some time on them.  Also, what is there to prevent an inventor from hiring/partnering with a businessman to promote and sell the product?  People hire services all the time.  Do you think a businessman programs his own software, maintains his own transportation, etc?

&gt;What I mean is, they all contribute to building up or protecting or raising the barrier to enter the market (or all of them). 

**Explain carefully how an anti-monopoly regulation contributes to ""building up or protecting or raising the barrier to enter the market"".**

&gt;Regulations on mergers and acquisitions, for example, can prevent challengers to the big institutions from existing, even though the idea is to prevent a big business gobbling up all the competition while it is small.

**How?**

&gt;China is one country, yes. They've moved towards a more free market capitalist system (As well as some other important factors) and they've reaped the rewards. South Korea and Brazil are also examples.

China?  Do you have any fucking idea, even a clue?  You are absolutely bullshitting if you think China has caught up with the West.  Go there or search for information on the poverty there.  Actually read something about their economic system so you don't look like a completely moron.  Wow, Brazil too.  I guess the favelas just magically transformed over night, huh?

&gt;Sure, Germany and Sweden, weren't gun-ho like the British, constantly running at deficits since time immemorial but they are no angels themselves.

What the fuck does that mean?  Face it when someone calls you out on your bullshit, you just spew some more vague bullshit don't you?  You were fucking wrong arsehole!

thanks 

that is the most valuable feedback i could have hoped for. 

I will need to fix a lot of these impressions . 

  *  the website is out of my control but i will fix the wording
  *  though the company has advertizing experts too (who are surprizingly pleasant and nice ,and not at all in line with the possible TV personas associated with the job ) my team works on the tech numerical side of marketting strategies and statistical analysis, half the team has a PhD in Statistics, and we have all worked in other tech companies as developers. 
so I don't know what the juniors in other departments are making, but we are competing for Highly-Skilled talent. 
  * let me give a loose example (to make sure i don't need to sign you all on NDAs and or kill you). you are given a dataset of N*10^7 mobile subscribers , please designa and analyse an experiment involving 2 million of them , at the end of which you will recomment which users should be offered a different data plan, and what would be the best approach (highest response rate) to offer it to them . (you also have data of previous campaigns to analyse on other users) (extra credit for discovering anything the operator did not know about his own customers, this is really open ended) {also design and develop meta tools for such analyses}
  * I believe you put the quotation marks on the wrong word :-)  ; point taken,  but the interns were not in our department.
  * I will make this more clear. i will have to think about it, but does the above example help  ?
  * i will change this, but as i had dropped out of my PhD for jobs such as this I feel a bit hypocritical asking anyone else for a degree. I thought i had covered this with ""demonstrable ability"".
  * when did data miner come to mean this ? no not at all, there is a salary and a yearly bonus. 

your gut feeling is wrong, it is not closer to the former. (I will get a reply from HR about the exact amount.)

your feedback is greatly appreciated.

No, of course not, funnily enough, it's the people in charge who run the newspaper, not the people who are just working there.

I would also argue that equality here doesn't necessarily serve society well and isn't the ultimate goal. The child's welfare is the ultimate goal. A lot of parents sort this out between themselves but if they all go to court to decide who gets the kids, how does the court decide which parent to go with? ""Dad only earns £20K a year and mum earns £30K a year. Mum gets custody."" ""Well they've both got good jobs and nice houses. They both live near their kid's school. Well, she's ginger so, yeah, Dad gets the kids."" What parameters do you use? How much discretion do you give a judge to a) decide what's best for the child and b) make sure they're consistent between all families.

As for having a meaningful relationship with both parents, well what does that even mean? How do you legally define a meaningful relationship? If they've dropped it from legislation then maybe they simply don't know how.

Furthermore given that the average life expectancy for a male is 77.2 years that means most taxpayers would never receive a pension?

If your 'solution' is that life expectancy is increasing then I suggest you analyse the figures more carefully - the large increase in life expectancy over the last several decades is mostly due to decreases in infant mortality which is now thankfully very low and has begun to plateau. 

Older people have been living longer, it is true, but this is not as widespread as one would expect from a naive look at the figures and they certainly haven't been living with the physical health required to work and at a time of high unemployment why employ frail elderly workers when you can employ healthy young ones for a lower wage (the minimum wage is reduced for young people)?",0,1320404084,null,0,false,0,c2wzmj0,t3_lzeii,t1_c2wzmj0,t1_c2wz2n9,1427828934,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

And.. we have to adjust what gates we have on all of our cattle fields, we can't leave the heavy industrial gates there, because they will take the gates right off the hinges! we have to use the weaker lighter material gates instead, which cows bend and thus make you unable to open the gate and leave the gate pretty banged up and useless.  Even if you weld the gate onto the hinges they will cut right through the hinge it's sat on. 
Then yesterday we find out one of our diggers, which was left a good couple hundred yards away from any road side had all the diesel stolen from it.  They had brought their own fecking bridges to get over the dykes, I mean come on! Luckily the digger actually held little diesel so it wasn't a huge hit, but my god it is getting ridiculous. /rant",0,1320406999,null,0,true,0,c2wzrzi,t3_m0472,t1_c2wzrzi,t3_m0472,1427829006,31,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,31

true,mappp,uk,Solihull,"I used equality as the overall goal as you were referring the parents reactions, obviously the child's welfare would come first. 

But in  cases where the child could live with either than the law needs to push equality, thus ensuring that both parents would have got the same access regardless of gender. Consistency isn't a major issue as the cases will most likely be based on their facts. So although a group of broad rules would most likely be established through case law the judge would be ultimately deciding upon the facts and this isn't uncommon in law.  

As for the definition of the right to a meaningful relationship this too would be found within case law and I would predict it would follow that the child and parent have a family connection of trust and reliance (reliance being emotional not just finical) [But noting I'm not a judge and I don't have any experience on this issue so this is just speculation to show an example of a possible interpretation.] 

Law is full of 'woolly' terms  such ""in good faith"" or the continued use of word ""reasonable"" to describe force, suspicion. Hence why the courts have proven that they are more than happy to interpret these ambiguous meanings, interpretation obviously being a key job of theirs. So I see this as a rather poor reason to drop the Act if you ask me.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I honestly didn´t know you´d say that, and I don´t know much about libertarian socialism.

OK, my apologies.  I'm a fecund poster here and I (perhaps wrongly) assume most regular posters know where I'm coming from.

&gt;Glancing at the wikipedia page, it seems to be about limiting the concentration of political or economic power, which is almost the definition of capitalism.

In a sense you're correct.  Libertarian socialism is a synonym for anarchism, which comes in many flavours, but which can be (and in my case is) also a synonym for a free(d) market.  There are collectivist anarchists too (anarcho-syndicalists, anarcho-communists mostly), whom I share a great deal with in many ways, but they are opponents of markets (which they believe are inherently oppressive), whereas I revel in them.

You and I might not be so far apart, it depends, but there's always that dubious definition of capitalism - are you for the free market or are you for currently existing capitalism and its massive State intervention?  They're opposites...  Anarchists believe capitalism and a free market are antitheses.

&gt;I neither think such a system would be stable (it would lead quickly to ad-hoc points of power)

I understand the fears, I can address them in depth if you wish, but they're mostly a reflection of where we're coming from and how power works in current capitalist society.

&gt;(which requires organizations which can invest large amounts of resources long-term, and support themselves in the meantime while they wait to reap the benefits)

The irony is of course that the very same people are doing the very same thing, only for less share and with less commitment and so on.

I think the main reason is that the factories, etc. are privately owned, and so when machines are implemented they just lay off workers to poverty, rather than sharing the benefits amongst all. Similarly, when given a choice between increasing productivity and increasing benefits, the bosses will always choose the former as they don't rely on the latter, so we'll work people to 85 if it makes a bit more money, because those who make the decisions aren't those who do the work.

true,PhoBWanKenobi,mcgann,McGann,"""Fanfic ending"" is exactly how I think of the end of Rose's story (particularly Davies' version where she and her Doctor get a TARDIS). Thing is, I don't think all the self-indulgent traits of fanfic make for great television. I like a little bitter with my sweet, I guess--it's more satisfying. Moffat's not a perfect writer, but he seems to understand that; [spoiler](/s ""the bittersweet moment in the The Wedding of River Song when 11 is *trying* to outrun his death but still manages to miss the Brigadier due to the inescapable nature of mortality was so much more genuinely stirring than the idea of Ten magically having time to visit everyone he has ever traveled with""). And sure, fun, campy sci-fi is great, but DW is capable of some great writing with real depth amidst the low production values--eps like ""Human Nature,"" ""Midnight"" and ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" and so many from the current audio dramas or season show that fun, over the top sci-fi can still be well-written, too.",0,1320431214,null,0,false,0,c2x2vp7,t3_m0eyu,t1_c2x2vp7,t1_c2x2pum,1427830469,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

true,curious_mormon,troughton,Troughton,"I think I have the opposite view.  I saw the ending as ""one last gift"" the doctor could give to each of his companions.  Jack - a (presumably) great one-night stand, Donna - enough money to get the life she wants, Martha and Mickey - their lives (together), Jane Smith - her son's life.  Rose, who had already received her gift, was something he took for himself.    I would also assume that he did this all in a matter of minutes, which works with his super radiation absorption power he demonstrated earlier. 

That said, I completely agree with you on the master portion.  I get that his ""resurrection"" (wierd btw?) seemed unuusal.  And if he did create a ""master race"" as copies of himself then why wouldn't they all try to kill him for authority.  Being so subservant to the original's authority doesn't fit the character.  

All in all, the time lord history, tennet's character, and the final moments was what made the film for me.

And there are plenty of chippies / burger vans around the ground. 

If you want to splash the cash a Scouse pie in Anfield is £4, but well worth it.

You won't be able to do it on the day but try and do a stadium tour and visit the Anfield museum. Ole Big Ears is on display, as are all of the medals Carra has won - he donated them all! I think all of King Kenny's medals are their too. There's loads of stuff on the origins of the club too, the early days and the stuff before the glorious empire that Shanks and co built. Plus loads on the golden era of the club as expected.

Visit the Shanks statue behind the Kop and get a photo taken with him. Stand under his gates and pay respects to the Hillsborough memorial. 

I'd advise arriving a few hours early like others have said and watch the players arrive. Enter the turnstiles around an hour before kick off, watch the players warm up, the stadium start to fill up and soak in the atmosphere.

As for Liverpool City Centre it's self, it all depends on what you're into. Food wise my favourite has to be egg cafe, on Newisham St (maybe) just off Bold Street. Amazing vegetarian food at cheap cheap prices, and it's BYO booze. Great even if you're not a vegetarian. 

For cheap-ish indian food, I'd go passage to india on Bold Street. Again it's BYOB, food is spectacular, not too expensive and the place is really nice for romantic meals too. Booking a table is a must on busy nights though.

""...primetime series cannot afford to allow their leading characters to develop, since the shows are made with the intention of running indefinitely. In a miniseries on the other hand, there is a clearly defined beginning, middle, and end, (as in a conventional play or novel) enabling characters to change, mature, or die as the serial proceeds.""

Roots, probably the most famous mini-series of all time, was 12 hours long.  After 3 ""seasons"" and a special DA will probably end up around the same.

The one thing I did learn reading that article is that there is no real definition of a ""mini-series"", it's all really subjective.  The defining element seems to be character development and that time passes.

I guess what it comes down to is how a show is marketed.  There are tons of other shows out there that could be defined as ""mini-series'"" and vice versa...

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I was only able to watch the first half and I thought we were pretty underwhelming across the board with the exception of Cudicini and Gallas.

Carroll didn't do a ton wrong but didn't really do anything good either...seems a bit afraid of fucking up so only really plays safe passes. Then again, he wasn't getting much help from our sulking front men. There was no link play at all really, and other than one good bit of play from Defoe the forwards were invisible.

I thought Livemore had one of his worst games...constantly gave the ball away and misplaced simple passes. I don't really like the Livemore / Carroll pairing at all, unless someone like Giovani is more fluid and links up with the forwards, or unless the forwards can be bothered to get off their lazy asses and pick the ball up once in a while instead of just backpedaling and showing for it. To be fair they did do this a few times but overall I was very disappointed with them since they were senior players. 

The young fullbacks struggled but I'm not going to crucify them because they were up against some tricky players and were under a lot of pressure.

I thought if I had to say one of the youngsters did well it was actually Falque, so not even one of ours :P. He worked really hard in the first half, had some good passing and tracked back to win possession several times. Nothing brilliant but I liked what I saw from him.

The booth used a dead bolt, you need someone in the other chamber to open the other door.  And I think you are suggesting that he traveled back and then used Eclestone's regeneration as fodder for the booth?  If you are you are basically at a smewhat modified version of the grandfather paradox.

Grandfather Paradox explained - say you find out your grandfather was the person who invented dynamite, or the atomic bomb or was a dictator, and you decided the world would be better without him and you had the luxary of time travel.  You go back and either kill him or turn him from his path, if you sucesed in either of these when you are born you never find out your grandfather did something terrible for humanity and thus would never go back.  Pardox begins, and the Tardis can not paradox without modification.

For the doctor this means he would take himself just before regeneration to free Wilf, Voice of the Wombles, Noble then regenerate into Tennant [or perhaps a whole new 10th Doctor as the people around him affect his new personality.  9 being filled with rage, but ten being so much kinder thanks to Rose, and 11 being childish because he met the young Amelia Pond].  Because he regenerates to 10 in the booth you then have the events leading up to the booth erased and instead different events happen in a different order.

true,Tokei,tardis,TARDIS,"I don't mind most of 'The End of Time', it was corny, over the top, and very cheesy writing, but Doctor Who is fairly infamous for that (every alien planet in the universe looks like a quarry in Whales!), and I accept that.  It's fun to watch cheesy science fiction.

The main issue I have with 'The End of Time' is what they turn the Time Lords into (meaning that ever bringing them back will have to rewrite or ignore the entire two parter), and 10's death.  When 9 left and became 10 they were very specific to write that he wasn't dying, he was merely changing, and becoming something new, but still the same man at heart.  But, when 10 left he made it look like it was a giant wake, and that we were never going to see the Doctor again, and that this was it, this was the end of the road for him.  It was classic bad RTD writing to a t: he tried to infuse a deep emotion into a scene and instead packed a load of C4 to the thing and watched it explode everywhere.  It was a horrible, horrible scene, especially when Tennant gives his 'I don't want to go' line.  I don't feel sorry for him for having to leave, I felt glad by that point after getting dragged over half an hour of his wake.

I like the movie in general, but there are very specific details that leave me hating it.  Moffat has handled much more emotion much better (when 11 is dying in 'Let's Kill Hitler' I genuinely love it, and when he is running away from his death in 'The Wedding of River Song' it is in such a way that I can believe it and emphasize, I understand what he is running from, and I understand his conflict), and now if he ever plans on bringing back the Time Lords he has to wiggle out of the mess RTD left when he left the series.  

That's why I hate 'The End of Time'.",0,1320457686,null,0,false,0,c2x6osi,t3_m0eyu,t1_c2x6osi,t3_m0eyu,1427832295,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,TabascoQuesadilla,mcgann,McGann,"The first half of Series 1 is ... well ... pretty shitty, with the notable exception of *The Unquiet Dead*, which is quite awesome.  But yeah, it's pretty crappy until you get past the first Slitheen episodes (*Aliens of London*/*World War Three*).

Bear in mind, the show was underoging a huge change in format - what was once a serialized show where each story lasted for ~4 half-hour episodes suddenly became an hourlong with only occasional two-parters and a subtle arc running through the whole season (though the arcs become much less subtle as the series goes on).

Basically what I'm saying is, they didn't really *get* the new format until midway through the first series.

So my suggestion to you is this:

Stick it out in Series 1 as long as you can.  If it proves too frustrating, say ""fuck it"" and skip ahead to Series 5 (first episode *The Eleventh Hour*).  New Doctor, new companions, new TARDIS, new sonic, new head writer, higher production values - it's a good starting point, and it's very strong from the get-go.  Then, once you finish Series 5 and 6, you can go back and start from Series 1 again - once you're already into the show, those early episodes won't seem nearly as bad to you.

Also, to be pedantic - you didn't watch the first episode of *Doctor Who*, you watched the first episode of the *revival*, which is, what, the 700-something-th episode, I think?

Also, they have a lot more rubber on the road = much better grip. Unless you drive a supercar with ceramic brakes, they'd probably outclass you and me when it came to it.

I do totally agree with you on stopping distance though - as I was saying about the M4 last night, everyone hit a deep flood of water at about 40mph, so of course braking only makes it worse at that point. Suddenly everyone in the fast lane tries to screech to a halt - and when you can't brake because of aquaplaning, you really need the distance. I think the rain must have caused flooding on the M5 too for an accident on this scale, it's just horrific.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"It's big gov't controlling the means of production and distribution, and interfering with the free-market on behalf of the chosen few. It's not the strictest form of socialism per se, but I enjoy pointing out how big business is in no way supportive of the free-market. Yet us proletarians get the wonders of free-market capitalism as a means to pull ourselves up by the boot-straps, shoved down our throats every five minutes, by people who actively spend lots of cash preventing a free-market from ever materialising.

Does that massive massive contradiction not annoy you? I don't particularly care for either capitalism or socialism, I'm not a genius, I do not claim to know how to fix the world. The only system I really care for is Evolution. But watching the poor of this country get pissed on by the establishment, to be told that welfare/handouts/gov't help are rotten socialism and that the level playing field of free-market capitalism that we have in this country gives every body a good chance to make something of their lives, all it takes is hard work, and that the poor are only poor because they are lazy, well that's insulting enough. So when the same fuckers peddling this myth are rigging the system, getting the gov't to spend money fighting their battles for them, stifling the free-market &amp; competition through big gov't, relying on this old boys network instead of hard work, receiving bail outs &amp; lobbying for tax payers money to be spent to artificially bolster their profits through wars/military industrial complex/privatising the NHS*, (which is basically just welfare for the wealthy), I reserve the right to call them out as socialists by their own definition.

Call me a sado-capitalist. If we have to put up with this cut-throat system, those who supposedly champion it should at least have to face it from time-to-time.

You just need to remove enough so that you can get incredibly drunk before you're poisoned, keep in mind that beer has methanol in it too and the cure for methanol poisoning is ethanol (!)

We're talking about using two buckets, a bin bag and a kettle filament to distil hooch in a prison cell. You don't get to control the choice of yeast, the temperature or the ph of the mash during fermentation, so you've got no real control of the methanol content.

When heating your liquid to 80 degrees it has to go up through 50 degrees, which will evaporate the methanol first. Moonshiners just throw away the first shot glass full (foreshot) and smell and compare the second; methanol smells fishy compared to ethanol. Also this is often done during the second distillation when everything's purer and easier to separate. Not that I run an illegal still or anything!

true,JustJoshingLiek,null,null,"It's great to support people/celebs, but have you witnessed what fangirls/fanboys are like? They are highly obsessive and actually extremely creepy. People aren't dissing MTV EMA, or to some extent the celebs, it's more the fans.

I like RHCP for example, but I won't engrave their name into my wrist with a knife, just like a teenager did for Justin Bieber. We may all be able to enjoy these celebs if they didn't have a creepy fan base. Justin Bieber (as an example) may actually be a genuine dead on 17 year old, but because of his fanbase we ""hate"" him, and then all the ""jokes"" come in. His music is not my cup of tea, so I don't listen to it, but now that we've all seen the fans and what they do, people then take out their disgust on the actual artist.

There's not a black and white area were people are either stalking celebs or at home on reddit making snarky comments, some people are just doing what they do every week, such as going out and having a good time, they then might also have extra time to come onto reddit and voice their opinion. I see where you are coming from, but you need to take both sides into account. 

Some great things have come from MTV like Jackass and Beavis &amp; Butthead, but honestly rose tinted spectacles need to be taken of if you aren't seeing the type of people it attracts. ""Audition to be part of the Audience"" says it all really, it's great to be enthusiastic, but people are being denied tickets due to failing an audition? Usually you can be fairly enthusiastic if there is a great atmosphere to get you going on a spur of the moment thing. Look at sport, you may go to a match thinking, ""ack, this is gonna be shite, they lost their previous two matches"" then with the crowd cheering, chanting, singing, getting along, you feel picked up and join in. You don't need to audition to be part of that crowd.

true,rasori,null,null,"As an American studying at the University of Liverpool, let me share first-hand experience with you on the funding:

You'll get nothing other than NHS healthcare from the UK government. On the flip side, they expect nothing from you in terms of taxes, as a student, unless you choose to take on a part-time job (which will be difficult to find, but under typical visas is allowed without special further applications, up to 20 hours per week during term and as much as you want outside of term).

Funding will need to come from the states. The loan scheme recently introduced by the Obama administration is actually pretty nice in handling this, the University knows what to do. Expect (at UoL) to get your loan payment around the end of October. You won't be hassled for tuition in that time, but you'll want money saved to cover you at least through then.

Fees for international students have not raised much, as international students NEVER got money from the UK government and basically were always expected to pay what the government already did for local students. The most expensive programme at UoL next year is medicine at 22,550 GBP. Engineering and similar sciences are around 14,850. Cheapest seem to be humanities and social sciences, at 11,550. Look [here](http://www.liv.ac.uk/study/international/money-and-scholarships/undergraduate-fees.htm) for information on your specific course.

At the UoL, except in Medicine and Dentistry, you'll be given a fixed fee guarantee. Even though the prices increase year-by-year, you will pay the same amount until graduation under this guarantee.

UoL guarantees availability of halls of residence for first-years if requested by the end of August or some such. The cost varies from 89-130 GBP per week, bills included (I believe the disparity is with regards to catered or self-catered but I could be wrong, as I didn't stay in halls). Halls can be found with private companies, I'd recommend looking up UNITE who have a lot of choices in Liverpool. Flats can vary greatly and are hard to judge without being here. I moved in with my girlfriend who was already here and had the option of checking flats for the both of us, but really I'd definitely recommend making sure you can visit any flat you're interested in renting, which means it's probably not a good choice for your first year. (That said, if any of the people you know is interested in a flat, it may open up the option for you).

Because the loans are through the US system, you won't be eligible for Pell Grants or Perkins loans. There's basically Stafford (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and PLUS loans, which are for parents to take on your behalf unless you're no longer considered a dependent. Of course as an American Indian you may well (read: almost definitely) have other funding options available to you.

true,strolls,null,null,"I'm not sure how I feel about this. My mother has solar panels on the roof of her bungalow, and consequently makes considerable savings on her electricity bills. 

She gets paid on a per-unit basis for the electricity she puts into the grid, not only from her electricity supplier, but from the government, too.

The property is double-glazed, and she got cavity insulation foam put in for free a few years ago (another subsidy) because she's a pensioner. I think her panels are set to repay their cost after about a dozen years - the electricity company pays her money in the summer, and the panels obviously increase the value of her property.

So I kinda feel she's being rewarded being well-off enough to make the investment in the first place. Considering the returns, anyone who had the money would choose solar panels, but it requires you own your own place and don't plan on moving for a few years. If you can only afford to rent, then tough luck - this seems like a subsidy at the expense of renters and property-buyers who can't afford the up-front costs.

The solar industry seems to have been booming the last few years, and there are now even companies which will install solar panels for free, presumably profiting on the returns these subsidies provide. 

Since the cost of installing panels has fallen by 30% in the last 2 years, this cut seems only to return the cost-effectiveness of solar to (approximately) where it was when the scheme started.

true,ivaat,null,null,"Yup. It's not the formation, it's the personnel. 4-4-2 worked well for us last season, with Kuyt and Suarez up front and the types of Mereiles and Maxi in the midfield - intelligent footballers who can alternate positions and keep the play fluid. But in fairness, a lot of people have been saying this for a long, long time now. 

With Carroll, I'm really not sure what formation we'd have to play to get him in the game at all. 4-5-1 with two good wingers and two attacking midfielders maybe. But what's clear is that the 4-4-2 with him up front is just so incredibly easy to defend against. When we launch a long ball to him, don't even bother challenging Carroll for the header, let him win it, just keep one man covering Suarez and one man between Carroll and our midfielders, and they always have the second ball.

I realize that with Gerrard injured, our plan B is to bring Carroll back in. But I'd much, much rather see either Bellamy or Kuyt starting instead of him. Carroll just offers nearly nothing and hinders our game so much. It's gotten to the point where people praise him for his ""good"" game when he's won a couple of headers, managed to string a few passes or scored an easy goal. That's not enough. That'd be expected of any decent footballer. If we want to get to top 4, we must get more from a striker.

Under Kenny we have improved vastly and, although we might not be winning games at the moment, we are creating chances, playing some good looking football at times and I can honestly say we have a chance at beating every 'Top 4/5/6' team.

Tennant was lucky because RTD actually knew how to subtly plant hints and clues for the story before revealing the entire truth. Moffat gives everything away right from the get-go. And when you think he's throwing you a red herring? It ends up being the same thing anyway in the end.

Moffat has been the problem since The Eleventh Hour. Not Matt Smith. Without the quality writing to back it, how do you expect an actor to look good with crap all around him making him look bad?

With Amy/Rory and a whole lot of River, I don't think we've gotten enough focus on this Doctor. It seems like all the stories revolve around the companions now.

In 28 league appearances last season, Maxi averaged 0.4 goals per game. Doesn't sound like much, but against other midfielders was equal with Kuyt (and a few others) and bested only by a ratio of 0.5 by Van der Vart.

This season Adam has averaged only 0.2 goals per match, Downing has the same ration of 0.2 gpm, and Henderson has only averaged 0.1 gpm. **Statistically, Maxi Rodriguez scores with twice the frequency of those players.**

Now fair enough, he took more shots. 1.7 per game vs 1.2 for Adam, 1.5 per game for Downing and only 0.9 for Henderson, **but he also had a higher percentage of shots on target.** Not by a significant margin, but  even a narrow margin proves my point.

Additionally, none of these statistics include today's match, **so Adam, Downing and Henderson's numbers will suffer even more.** Given that he has played in all three of their positions before, I chose them as the basis for comparison. I would be happy to entertain any other data if you don't find this to be enough.

true,Squirrel_Army,troughton,Troughton,"First of all, the pace is often slower in classic Who considering each story typically had to last two hours or so. It's often sort of like many of the two-parters of the new series (Age of Steel/Rise of the Cybermen, The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit) in that they tend to spend the extra time fleshing out characters, providing exposition and so on, to the point where the story kind of feels like it drags a bit.

Also, considering the budget they were given to produce each story, the special effects and set/prop design can be pretty ridiculous (Episode 4 of The Keys of Marinus particularly comes to mind with regards to set design; the early CSO effects in many Pertwee stories are some of the special effect low-points).

The last couple of problems with classic Who involve the characters; the companions rarely have very much development throughout the series, while the many of the actors brought in for each individual story give incredibly ""hammy"" performances.

It's definitely not all bad though. The sense of playful fun and creativity that sets the series apart from other Sci-Fi series like Star Trek is apparent throughout most of the classic series, though it kind of fluctuates depending on, among other things, the production era (also, Troughton's doctor seemed to establish that side of the character much more that Hartnell tended to).

Plus, it's great fun seeing how the series has changed over the years, including the many times the Doctor has faced off against his greatest foes.

However, what I think he fails to do is react to how the game is going and make intelligent, incisive substitutions at the right time. We were crying out for a right footed player on our left flank today so Enrique could overlap more efficiently, and we needed a player with vision for a short pass or through ball in the middle of the park. Preferably, around the 60 min mark, I would've thought that we needed to bring on maxi and/or bellamy. Both could give versatility on the left flank, maxi has the ability to play as an ACM or Bellamy could've played upfront, allowing Suarez to drop deeper and be more creative. We need a midfield spark. Lucas has been shaped to be an excellent destroyer, Adam is all about the excellent long range ball when he has time and space and Henderson is more about energy and dynamism and instinct than any actual composure or incisiveness.

It's always more expensive on fixed over the long term. In the short term it's cheaper when the bank gets it wrong - assuming the bank gets it too cheap not too expensive. However people fix for 2 or 5 years and that offers very little protection. A 2 year fix means that if there's a spike in rates you're going to get hit anyway, unless you fix right before it and by the end of 2 years it's gone. Slim chance of that. A 5 year means that while you may have certainty for 5 years at the end of it if things have changed significantly then it's a great big dirty jump.

A 25 year fixed rate would be more expensive than a tracker, because it'd have a bit of insurance built in, because the bank has to account for risk. I don't want the poorer people to have to pay that. I'd rather everybody was on a BoE tracker for the life of the mortgage, with a larger margin for a higher LTV which could be stripped away over time as equity improved.

You're right about the whole property thing, it's something that has happened in the past 10 years. The smug baby boomers with their massive equity thanks to a shortage of supply, using their savings to snap up as many properties as they can saying that people always need somewhere to live and it's as safe as houses.

I can totally agree with that entire thing. I'm in the same position. I find the constant stream of reposts so frustrating. I've been practically reporting every single repost (although I'm getting slightly worried at the lack of reposts I am reporting being deleted and wondering if I am wasting my time) and counting them. We've had more than 11 reposts of the same thing in the past. 3 of them in less than an hour than the original. Is is that hard to check? This is still going on despite the recent mod post even to the point where I have started doing images because it annoys me such as [this](http://i.imgur.com/IuubH.jpg), [this](http://i.imgur.com/3qYuv.jpg) and when people seem to ask..AGAIN where to start watching DW...I wonder if they can see it with some aided assistance like [this](http://i.imgur.com/igUmv.jpg). Despite this annoying me I have never once insulted a user or even spoken directly to a user in a bad way. 


Also what are frustrating is that regular postings of nothing special. What exactly makes your post stand out against the rest? Like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/m18qh/i_was_watching_malcolm_in_the_middle_when_suddenly/). I mean..*WOW OMG A BOW TIE. I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN ONE OF THOSE BEFORE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.* 


My recent post of a (fairly) silly but actually fairly picture is a good example of the type of thing that you should post IF you want to post something that is a bit silly. It's unique. How many times do you see Neil Gaiman, Craigy and a TARDIS with a vegetarian haggis shoved into it. It's also suitable as a wallpaper for 1080p (and similar ""aspected"" screens). But if you want something a bit more serious then the posts in the self post above are perfectly suitable.


Also pics made using http://memegenerator.net and similar things...IMHO should be decent, funny and unique. Be aware there is also tumblr for that sort of thing as well.


Can't think of anything else to add.

I have a tad bit more personality than that and would like to use it before my brain decides to blow up.

Concerning the deleting...I'm not saying they should suddenly start deleting them, but maybe put it to a vote. If something is put to a vote and gets a majority voted ban then people can't be too upset when it is deleted. After all, many other subreddits do infact have rules for this type of thing.

Nope. Didn't know that. I thought I've read almost every single post to this subreddit for the past few weeks +. Must have had a really long delayed posting. But either way, I feel that I at least went to further lengths than the normal stuff. Got any links?

As for the ""new people"" I find that if I am new to a subreddit and plan on doing more than just stalking then I always read the rules/faq or whatever even if it is just skim reading it. I see no reason why other people can't do the same to be frank. OK sure maybe it should be made a bit more obvious like popping a ""New to /r/DoctorWho"" in a corner somewhere or something but I'm not entirely sure I would want people who neither read the FAQ first, OR read the bold text when actually posting the thing. It would hardly be the best first impressions. Sure it may be nice getting a human response but 99% of that human response will just be downvoting, copy and pasting or linking to it anyway especially when the OP doesn't actually elaborate beyond ""I'm new, where do I start?""

The advanced technology is typical of spy movies like that. And sometimes the most advanced stuff isn't even in the possession of Bond or MI6 (Moonraker). 

The alias and the British blood are just silly arguments. 

I see no similarity because the character doesn't change. Different actors portray him, but Bond is a character from novels. It is there that we discover that he does not change in appearance,  or regenerate if you must. 

His long life is just a ploy to keep the character relevant throughout a multitude of political climates. Like in my other reply, I'll bring up Moneypenny and M. They change actors as well.

I think the idea of a voted deleting is a good idea.

You've got a point about the new people, but that's under the assumption that most people who come to r/doctorwho already know about reddit. I never knew reddit existed until I stumbled upon r/doctorwho during a google search result. I had no idea of the rules, specific individual characteristics of subreddits, or what subreddits even were.

It would be sad if most people downvoted someone who wanted to get into the show. If people ask where to start, I do actually copy and paste a large response I've written out.

What I had written that first time around was probably the best I could do in explaining, so I keep it around if necessary.

Conversely, there's only so many times that a 'DAE feel this guy is underrated?' Eccleston-related topic can be reposted. I mean seriously, the guy was the Doctor for 1 year out of *50*, of *course* he's going to be passed over when viewing the series as a whole.

There's also those topics with questions like 'DAE cry at the end of The End of Time/The Girl in the Fireplace/Doomsday/Journey's End?' that really only have one 'correct' answer. Most of the time I don't bother responding to those topics, as they largely comprise of variations upon the answer 'yes'.

I love Doctor Who, everything about the show, and I love David Tennant as my Doctor. But I love 9 and 11 too (I just began watching 1, so I can't expand more on how amazing other Doctors are; I'm fairly sure I'll love them all though).     

However, I do agree that there is a big tendency to downvote when people disagree with you; hence why I usually keep my mouth shut, especially in regards to disliking of any particular Doctor or his companions. I don't think I should have to voice my opinion in other subreddits to avoid being downvoted here; we're a great community and we should act like it. Not everyone will like the same things, not every Doctor behaves the same way.   
I've been fairly good, I think, with the downvoting. When someone is insulting, I downvote; I was pretty surprised the first time I did, I wasn't expecting the red waterfall. When it is an opinion I disagree with, *I move along*. If I don't know enough about Doctor Who to say something, I simply move along. Hell, if anything, I upvote the lot of you, because I'm just glad someone has seen the same show as me.

The concept of traveling alone might work for some Time Lords and Ladies, but I think it would be so neat to have a married couple travel together, sharing the same adventures and working as a perfectly united team.  I'm not sure what we would wear, but it would be entirely obvious by our interactions that we think the other, not our TARDIS, is the most beautiful thing in the universe. I like the idea of the chameleon circuit being stuck on something that would not take a big footprint of land on the outside, but speaking for me, i think it would be nice to have it always stuck on a natural object (tree, boulder, et c.) that is just a bit off  from that location. For instance, in the UK it might show up as an enormous Saguaro cactus but in Arizona it could show up as a blackcurrant bush.

He's quite capable of going from giving the sense of an energetic twelve to that of a tired ninety in the span of a moment.

As for my own experience, Tennant was my first.  At first I was turned off by the faces he made, then of course I grew to treasure them.  When Smith came along with his much less animate features I found him ugly and dull and unlikeable, but I fought to give him a chance because I knew most of my dislike was because he wasn't Tennant.

The episode that turned it all around for me was The Lodger.  He was charming, he could cook, and he looked *dead* sexy in football kit.  That those of us with DVR and quick pausing fingers got to see his tonker was just icing on the incredibly lustable cake.  I've loved him ever since and, while Tennant will always be *my* Doctor, I'll happily salute Smith as one of the worthier individuals to be known as *the* Doctor.

To me Ecclestein is cheeky and off the cuff. To people who started with Tennant, Ecclestein just appears to be a jerk in comparison to Tennants very cool and sly demeanor. Case in point:

The Doctor: Ten thousand years in the future. Step outside, it's the year 12,005. The New Roman Empire.

Rose: You think you're so impressive.

The Doctor: I **am** so impressive.

IMO The different doctors are exactly that. Different. One is not inherently better than the other. They all work together to portray who The Doctor REALLY is by their unifying traits. He's a lover, and a fighter. He's a wise man, and a know it all. He's timeless, and lives in the moment. He's The Doctor, and that's why we love him.

true,XSy0,null,null,"This season is almost written off.  We arent going to win the league, we may get 4th but its probably not going to happen.  I still think Arsenal are favourites for it, even if they have had a bad season.  Spurs are also in the mix. 

My point being; we are still in the rebuilding phase.  Kenny has invested 20+million into each of these players, they are players for the future, not just for a quick fix.  As such he is trying to find a system and way to get them playing how he wants them to play.  Playing Maxi might bring a quick fix.  Bellamy is the same, he's 30, he was bought as cover for injuries and maybe to help rest players.  Playing him is a quick fix.  

Whats the point in playing them, winning some games, maybe getting 4th this season then next season when theyre maybe too old or too slow, with a schedule involving more games (qualifiers and europe) youre forced to play other players.  You're then forced to play Downing and Henderson again, we have this conversation again, only this time its another year, another year that we've not developed as a team and a force, another year of not being able to attract top names, another year risking losing suarez? reina? Gerrard being a year older and finding someone to fill his boots.  I appreciate there comes a point where you accept Downing isnt going to achieve what you wanted him to, or expected him to, but i dont think thats the case yet.

I havnt been a fan of Downing ever, i wasnt happy about him signing, i think he's one dimensional and doesnt get involved enough in build up play, that being said he was bought because of the past 3 seasons he's crossed the ball more than anyone.  That in theory meant chances for Carroll.  Carroll hasnt played every game, this hasnt helped downings cause (im not for one minute suggesting its the sole reason, i completely accept he should be doing far more).  Theres also the Enrique factor, he somewhat takes Downing job away from him, he gets so foreward and stays out wide - somewhat forcing downing into a position he'd rather not be in - and one where he's not at his most effective.

I really think the main problem is Adam.  He doesnt have the pace to get involved with Suarez in the middle of the park like Stevie used to do with Torres.  This forced Henderson / Downing to come infield somewhat to do so.  This often results in Carroll running out wide because thats where the space is and all of a sudden we have our wingers in the middle of the park, our target man is out wide and its a mess.  All stemming from Adam's poor pace and mobility. If he wants to play Adam he needs to either drop Lucas, which is a bad idea because Adam cant do his job, and pair Adam with an attacking midfielder - Stevie G.  The alternative is to change formation.  Play almost 4-3-1-2.  Play Adam + Lucas + Henderson across the centre of midfield, put some1 ahead of them, maybe Stevie G to link up with the strikers, and then rely on full backs - Enrique and Johnson to provide width.  This is far from ideal and probably results in Downing being dropped.

Henderson i think started the season well, i think a few misses and other things have somewhat knocked his confidence.  He has the ability but maybe just needs that little bit more maturity.


Im not for one second suggesting he couldnt start a stronger team, but the guy is looking 4years down the line, when certain players boots are hanging up somewhere.

10 was also more like a '1 warning or I'll show you my fury' kind of guy, whereas 11 seems to skip warnings more often (demon's run, Silence in day of the moon, Cybermen in closing time, the doctor's wife (orders the TARDIS to kill House) and probably some more I can't think of.

10's 'humanness' is also typically portrayed by him saying 'Sorry, I'm so sorry' and for example in the fires of Pompeii he goes back to save that family at pleading request of Donna. I guess the best way to explain the difference between 10 and 11 in this area is that 10 was more focused on saving everyone whereas 11 is more focused on stopping the evil.

My mother has solar panels on the roof of her bungalow, and consequently makes considerable savings on her electricity bills.

She gets paid on a per-unit basis for the electricity she puts into the grid, not only from her electricity supplier, but from the government, too.

The property is double-glazed, and she got cavity insulation foam put in for free a few years ago (another subsidy) because she's a pensioner. I think her panels are set to repay their cost after about a dozen years - the electricity company pays her money in the summer, and the panels obviously increase the value of her house.

So I kinda feel she's being rewarded being well-off enough to make the investment in the first place. Considering the returns, anyone who had the money would choose solar panels, but it requires you own your own place and don't plan on moving for a few years. If you can only afford to rent, then tough luck - this seems like a subsidy at the expense of renters and property-buyers who can't afford the up-front costs.

The solar industry seems to have been booming the last few years, and there are now even companies which will install solar panels for free, presumably profiting on the returns these subsidies provide.

Since the cost of installing panels has fallen by 30% in the last 2 years, this cut seems only to return the cost-effectiveness of solar to (approximately) where it was when the scheme started.",0,1320552106,null,0,false,0,c2xfsri,t3_m1j8r,t1_c2xfsri,t1_c2xblkt,1427836795,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

First of all, my TARDIS's chameleon circuit would be stuck on... Well, frankly I think I'd manage to get it stuck on ""invisible"" and have it be that way for so long I don't remember what the last thing she looked like was. I think it probably happened during a failed attempt at inventing a new sort of coffee.
As for what I'd wear I think a series of variations on shirt, skirt, and boots would be good- in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and colors. Maybe now and then if it were cold I could whip out a really impressive looking coat. 
Each of my adventures would begin with an assortment of swearing, because my TARDIS still hasn't forgiven me for breaking the circuit and won't let me figure out where I am without doing it the hard way. So everywhere I'd go, I'd walk up to the first person to be spotted and go ""Hello, I'm lost."" It would all build from there, with me just sort of meddling a bit in whatever I happen across.
Now and then I might grab a companion, and I think they'd come up with their own names for me, based on however I picked them up.
Also, based on who I am in real life, I think it's safe to say I'd constantly be reaching down the front of my shirt and pulling out strange things.

So, destroying or modifying their form should weaken the angel.

However, the angel's form doesn't seem to be harmed by most things. Even when observed, they don't seem to be harmed by anything: guns don't harm them, they'd absorb the power of nukes (I think) ...but their stone form can be degraded by lack of energy! Tellingly, the angels deprived of energy suffer diminished form and power. My guess is that even the stone (that the angel's aren't) cannot be harmed by anything but lack of energy input.

true,TX1138,pertwee,Pertwee,"&gt;The Silence is a bit of a weird enemy. I understand their purpose but at the same time I don't. I feel like they could've given a bit more background on them.

I think the Silence present themselves as very different class of enemy for the Doctor; one that have founded their very existence entirely around the myths and legends of the character himself.  In the past, we've had enemies that have had random encounters with the Doctor, but even the ever-present Daleks have other ambitions besides trying to exterminate him.  We had a brief period with Torchwood attempting to track down the Doctor, but there was never any real sense of looming menace or threat. By the end of Series 2, the Doctor-centric aspect of the organisation was forgotten entirely.

Throughout the New Series, we've always had a sense of safety and security around the Doctor and the TARDIS crew. If any danger presented itself, there was always the option to run back into the TARDIS and fly off into the vortex for safety. The Silence, however, have successfully breached this sense of security. They've so far managed to compromise the safety of the TARDIS, fool the Doctor on a number of occasions through the use of Flesh Avatars, and manipulate events to force the Doctor to abandon his companions and go into hiding.

I think the most fascinating aspect of the Silence is how Dorium referred to them as the 'Sentinels of History'. Throughout the Moffat era, we've seen how the Doctor has been willing to use his time-travelling abilities to manipulate events to achieve his desired outcome; *A Christmas Carol* demonstrated how he'd even be willing to deliberately alter a person's timeline to transform them into a more malleable individual. In the Silence, we have an enemy that has proven itself more than capable of using similar tactics. Now, not even time travel is solely the Doctor's domain. 

The Silence are an enemy that have forced the Doctor far beyond his comfort zone. Despite the fact that they think he's dead, the Doctor is still in a position of weakness. More than any other enemy of the New Series, the Silence have proven that they are more than a match for our hero.

As much sight seeing as the Doctor with none of the trouble.

Sure, I'd be a coward, but ultimately I'd be a good person who couldn't leave people in danger.

I'd wear something akin to Doctor Ten, and slightly informed by Five, with a bit of the nerdy/professor stuff from 11 occasionally. Sort of yuppie/geek chic. a blazer and trousers(not a suit, however. They would be mismatched. Blue blazer with brown trousers, for example) with a pair of trainers, alternating light jumpers and ties, and changing the coat style as an alternate--swapping the blazer for a gilligan jacket, for example. The hair of an idiot goes without saying--somewhere between Ten and Eleven.

Good call on Skrtel and Agger though, I think Carra has got to the time in his career where he shouldn't be starting, his pace is none existant, which has lead to a few mistakes this season, Bolton's goal being a glaringly obvious example.

Also, right sided midfield are you suggesting playing Bellamy or Downing, as both end up cutting in as there left sided players out of position, at the minute I think we are better playing Kuyt there, but only as he is the best of a bad bunch on the right side, maybe even play Johnson right wing, as it would suit the aspects of the game he is strong at. 

January I would definately be in the market for a right winger and a striker, but I wouldn't give King Kenny the decision on who to buy, rather leave it to Comolli, even if it does mean getting some player I have never heard of, from some distant land.

The biggest problem is that once a post gets caught it loses any traction it would otherwise have had - spam filtered posts never do as well as those that get through.

On the plus side with a small subreddit like this we can at least keep on top of the new queue and actually approve things ourselves. On large subreddits unless you notice and PM the mods with a link to the post you have no chance!

I actually mentioned this to one of the admins the other day - I suggested that we be able to disable it on small subreddits like this that don't really attract much actual spam. Didn't get a response to that part of my message but they did at least read it. They've been going on about fixing the spam filter for about 2 years now though so I don't hold out much hope.

What I need to do is set up an RSS feed for the mod queue onto my phone with something that polls it every 15 minutes or so and beeps at me when something is caught.

I dare say it'd be difficult to make a real wage out of it but definitely a supplementary income until you work out more or get yourself in a better position: ebay.  You only really need to have, or be able to borrow, a half decent digital camera and a couple hundred quid of float for stock.  Shops are going out of business because its easier to build a virtual shop window these days with none of the killer overheads.

I have an uncle that ended up later in life running a pet food shop, his son, my cousin worked with them in the shop.  They actually said despite everything my uncle had done in the past, some really well paid work, once they knew the tax circuit  the small business of all things was the thing that reaped them the most for least.  They went into selling their products on e-Bay too with my cousin holding that helm.  Apparently it is much more time consuming than people think but if you can be disciplined enough to put the hours in it does build.  Selling the same stock from the shop they began having to double their stock.  As much stock was going out through the e-window as it was the shop door...but with none of those overhead costs that come with a shop.

Being an internet DelBoy might not sound all that attractive but if you go into it with the right attitude and determination it can build with the real advantage of none of the real initial outlay that usually comes with setting up a business.  Find an interest, even if its something you're more of a spectator at rather than a participant and commit yourself to doing 30-40 hours a week as a second line of income.  Big commitment but even if you only start off making a £50-100 a week, which hour wise seems a wasted venture, but 50 to a £100 surplus is worth more in quality of life than £300 if you know the £300 is accounted for in bills and living costs before you wake on Monday morning.  If you're selling  something you're interested in it will grow and open up more doors.

But I wonder if what we're seeing is just a difference in the depths of . . . well, nerdyness. 

I'm a huge nerd (I own multiple editions of *The Star Trek Encyclopedia*), and a writer, and a former academic, so I'm likely to be long-winded and nerdy and pedantic, and that's that type of discussion I enjoy, too. Essays and anaylses and comments that are really long-winded works of feminist criticism are all right up my alley, and I always upvote them.

Other people, not so much. This is a fandom with broadening mainstream appeal, and other people like this stuff because it's nifty, because bowties are cool, not because they want to discuss the role of religion in 70s DW, or whatever. And that's cool. I mostly ignore them, personally. I got my panties into enough of a knot complaining about the Star Trek reboot's dumb use of dumb science back in 2009. I realize now that it's not worth it. People like shows for different reasons, and another Whovian's love of fezzes doesn't invalidate the work you'd put into developing a conlang for Gallifreyan.

I get it, though. It's frustrating to see your fandom and your space be co-opted. But I think it's healthier just to roll with the punches with this kind of thing--and this subreddit really *is* just about the best place to find Whovian discussion on the internet.

10 to my limited perspective was very much about how the Doctor **wanted** to be more moved on than he actually was. If the 9th Doctor was all about hitting the moments of insight and epiphanies that lead us out of the darkness, 10 was about coming to grips with the fact that just because you're out of the tunnel doesn't mean you're free from the darkness. 

While it may seem heretical, I think of 9 as ""The PTSD Doctor"" and 10 as ""The Depressed"" Doctor. 11 is what happened when he finally accepted defeat and let his limitations run through him and beyond him. Thus 11 is more 'well-adjusted', and part of that has been reclaiming the fact that for all his time spent around humans he *isn't* a human. The fact that he has extremely great examples of humanity in Rory and Amy helps highlight this growth.

I found her presence so refreshing after Rose. I didn't *hate* Rose, but, like you, I didn't love her either. But I thought that Martha was a great match for him. She was very capable and very independent, and the conflict between her crush on the Doctor and his romantic disinterest in her made for really interesting viewing. I think it was tragic the way he treated her--but good for her for getting fed up, leaving, and going to do her own thing.

I guess I really don't mind a lack of romance for the Doctor. I *am* a fan of his relationship with River Song, and now that I've watched some of the older series, I liked the hints of romance between Romana II and the 4th Doctor. I have this very strong sense of wanting to know that the women he pairs with are his equals. The power dynamic between Rose and the Doctor was so skewed that there's no way that relationship could have ever been anything but unhealthy--likewise, if Moffat had gone there with Amy and the Doctor.

Yeah, I don't expect to finish the classic seasons before Christmas but I do at least want to get started. From what I keep hearing I will probably end up enjoying the 4th Doctor, he seems pretty good too from the few scenes I've seen. I've already seen a bit of the 1st Doctor as well when I watched the first episode that had the Daleks.

I do kind of agree that the Master might've gotten a bit carried away. Especially when I remember ""The End of Time"" special. Just that whole time when he became every human on earth, it was a bit too comical for my taste, but he made up for it later. I really liked his scene when he was speaking to the doctor about how the drums never stop. You can tell then that he's not necessarily evil, he just has this part of him that drives him to madness. That in turn is probably what causes the Doctor to show so much mercy for him, he knows he's not wrong at heart.

I have not seen ""Time Crash"" but after you talked about it, it seems interesting. I just looked it up in the reference guide and found out where it was. When I was watching series 1-5 I was on netflix so I would just follow the episode pattern then. Problem was that any specials were on separate videos so I missed a few by accident. At least I managed to get ""Waters of Mars"" in, that was a great episode to see the Doctor change so much.

I do agree with you that Smith definitely improved with series 6. I feel like he solidified his character more and got some of his quirks down better. Still a bit too eccentric for my taste at times, but I can tell he's trying his best at it. At the same time, I can't even imagine what kind of pressure must be on him with this. When you're role is preceded by 10 different actors and personalities, it must be extremely difficult to find your niche and still speak to the fans.

And the Silence, I do agree that they're a very interesting foe. I loved the idea of how you would forget about them once you turned away. The little recorded messages, the black number marks on your body. Every time they showed up, I knew sh*t just got real. But I do also feel like they played them off a bit too quick. You see them for the 1st 2 episodes and then they don't really show up much at all until the end. Truth be told, I almost thought they were completely dead after the whole moon transmission, but then again, when are any of the Doctor's enemies truly dead and gone?

true,thedoctorzoe,null,null,"I found her needy in the sense that she wanted so desperately for the Doctor to love her back.  To me it is most clear in the episodes ""Human Nature"" and ""The Family of Blood"" when Martha gets so jealous.  To me, this came across as needy in the sense that she just couldn't deal with the Doctor being with anyone else.  My main problem with Martha was the way that she left the Doctor, in my opinion, she seemed a little ungrateful as she basically told him that it was his fault that she was leaving because he didn't love her the way that she loved him.  I will recognize that one of the reasons that I disliked Martha could have been that I just didn't form any attachment to her in the series because I knew that she would not be in the next series.  I wasn't a fan of hers in the first episode and things only went down hill from there.  I was not a fan of hers as a character, even when she made an appearance in Torchwood, I just disliked her.  I will admit though that some of the absolute best episodes were ones in which she appeared, like ""Blink,"" ""Family of Blood,"" and the Master trilogy.  To me, even though Martha had some of the greatest episodes, she was over shadowed by Donna who wasn't as meek when it came to telling the Doctor he was wrong.  This is just one person's opinion though, I know plenty of people who really like Martha, but for me, she just didn't impress me.  I have a question or you though, do you prefer the writing in the more recent episodes with Smith or the writing of Davies with Eccleson and Tennant?

So the problem is manifold:

* Schools don't use heating or hot water much during the summer as they are closed and don't need to be heated. So you throw away the part of the year when solar hot water is most effective. 
* You need an alternative capable of providing 100% of the demand to account for low solar energy days and breakdowns. You can't just turn down the room temperature or water temperature in a school, or you have to start sending children home. So you need a full boiler system. 
* When you are consuming this much electricity and gas, you are rewarded for knowing how much you will consume. If it varies from this, you are penalised. So your tariff needs to account for the worst (no solar energy at all) and the best (50%? of the needs met throughout the year). You end up paying more for gas and electricity per unit as a result, possibly even countering any savings.
* You need a system that can heat water up to 70degC+ to deal with legionella. Solar will need boosting with boilers for most of the year.

It boggles the mind that you don't understand this, since they focused on highlighting this point when Tennant was dying. 

2. If you'd watched any other Doctor, you'd be calling to see the still living actors from those series to reappear, instead of Tennant.

The Doctor kissed a companion for the first time, he claimed to be half-human (by him and the Master with DNA stuff), and he said he could regenerate into different species. There are lots of non-tv explanations like the comic The Forgotten- I posted a link to it once.

Of course I said that changing stuff up like that was too drastic. You can't spring something like ""I'm half human!"" onto the fans- it'll flip them out.

If you were to also buy a cheap VHS player, and pack the whole collection (including the player) into a box for say... 20 years. You will suddenly find that the collection is a lot more valuable.

It was soul destroying to spend a whole day packaging stuff up, then another day hauling it to the post office in multiple trips, only to see 1/3rd of it go on scammers. I know people can, and do make it work, and I loved the spare money I got from it, but it's too easy to get scammed. Ive seen quite a few good sellers from my action figure collecting days go out of business for that very reason. One guy was the subject of a hate campaign from somebody who would repeatedly buy small cheap items on different accounts, then leave negative feedback until the seller had enough negative feedback to get their account closed.

I did once start up a business as a reasonably priced technician for older people who need their TVs and whatnot configured/minor PC faults fixed. That went kinda well until they start hounding you at all hours and refuse to pay because ""it's only a small thing.""

Since I can't turn back time and say 'I wish I'd left my job 30 years ago' the employers\government will naturally expect a little reticence from those who get asked to give up stuff they have been working towards ;)

""I see the pension as an optional extra, not a benefit. I have not opted into one, can't afford it at present. This is like staff at McDonalds walking out over a reduction in their food allowance.""

A pension is currently a necessity, not an optional extra; something Unions have banged on about for over 30 years.  With the state pension's viability being limited by the number of people who are surviving to a ripe old age, it's more important than ever to have a decent pension, and Unions have been at the forefront of making sure that pensions provided in several sectors are useful.  

They've had particular success in the public sector, because there are many places where union membership is so very high, so rather than one lone voice asking, there's a group.  That's how pensions in that area have got high - and good for them.  

Have a look into stakeholder pensions that your bank\building society provides.  It's well worth putting a little away - and check again with your company if they provide a pension.  There's no such thing as starting too late, or with too little.  After all, you have to *live* on the money you'll save in your pension for (hopefully) a long time.

I'm afraid it's nothing like staff walking out over a reduction in their food allowance; that IS a perk, and more to the point, it's transitory.  Your food allowance is only going to feed you *now*.

As for your question: I actually prefer the writing of Davies over Moffat. I mean, Moffat's great and his stories and characters are fun, but Davies' stories had a certain *feel* to them. I can't quite explain it, but I'll try. Davies' seemed more like the classic style of Who, and has that PBS sort of feel. I love to watch PBS' murder mystery shows, they've got a certain style, like they aren't making the shows for ratings, they make them for the sake of making a good show, and Davies seems to capture that feel, maybe trying to be reminiscent of the classics. Moffat's series seem more like primetime American television, which isn't a bad thing, I mean he has the budget and the skill to make the show something bigger and different. I just like one more than the other. 

And the more classic Who I watch the more I realize the writing in this show has always been changing, but it's always been good. ",0,1320613629,null,0,false,0,c2xlf7r,t3_m212d,t1_c2xlf7r,t1_c2xjyjq,1427839459,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,32bottlesofblargedy,null,null,"I'm new to the doctor as well, catching series 5/6 and going back for the rest (on blink now). Holy crap it's addictive  - so, so glad I finally watched an episode!

I feel strange in that I honestly and truly love all the doctors and companions equally so far. I guess I chose to let myself fall in to whatever the story was selling, even though I was FULLY prepared to loathe Rose because having a love interest for the doctor seems...wrong, unless there is an amazing explanation for it or circumstances. Even with that preconception, I chose to believe in it, which is why I actually didn't like Girl in the Fireplace. If the whole of RTD's era (whether Rose is there or not) centers around that love, it seemed so cheap to me to devalue it with him instantly falling for another person. Regardless of whether or not you like the rose/doctor angle, it undoubtedly cheapened what the show was pushing. Love the episode, hate the seeming fickleness of the doctor. 

However, you know, maybe he just is fickle. Look at Sarah Jane - while School Reunion wasn't a great episode, Sarah Jane's scenes truly showed how easily he casts off people. It's a side of the doctor I REALLY don't want to believe in, and probably why I fully buy in to the love angle. 

With that in mind, I like River as she lives up to ""amazing explanation/circumstances"" imo, although my issue here is that their relationship would've worked better if it was Tennant. Smith's alien characterization and veering away from the humanity that marked 10s reign makes him seem waaaaay too 'awkward little boy' to imagine a deep romantic intimacy. I don't doubt that Smith could act the part, but his characterization so far has not led me to really gel with the river/doctor relationship.

I like the Silence, think they're brilliant, but agree in that we need to see some back story. I also don't understand how they are a religious cult. Did...did they mean they're a religious cult and aliens? Because wth are those scary things doing then if they're not aliens? Very confusing to me, that whole notion. Was Kevorkian a Silence then?

Given those two scenarios, I identified with the angry Doctor more than the learning to live Doctor. 

Now, lets put acting back in it. I believe Tennant did a fantastic job of portraying how that Doctor was feeling. I could connect to it, I've felt emotions like he has. Simply, I could identify with him. Now we have Smiths Doctor. Again, in my opinion, is way to many smiles and prances and everyone's happy! When tragedies happen, I can't even see this Doctor expressing any real sorrow. Maybe that's this Doctor, maybe that is Smith's acting. I don't know. 

But what I do know, is that the writers must have changed. Tennant's Doctor was terrified of just one Dalek. Just one! Yet Smith's Doctor makes then all spin and dance just by using his screwdriver? That, and examples like it, killed that Doctor for me. If he has always been even remotely that powerful, the Daleks, the Cybermen, all of it, was just Tennants character running through a haunted house.

Unstoppable? He didn't come out victorious at the end of series 5 because he defeated all his enemies - they didn't win because they didn't know everything that was happening.

All of his enemies still managed to trap the Doctor and imprison him. A plan that would have worked if River Song hadn't been piloting the TARDIS.

He managed to escape the assassination attempt at the end of series 6, but his enemies have forced him to go underground. That doesn't strike me as unstoppable. :/

Yes? I imagine he has a great deal more to concern himself with than what his companions do behind closed doors.

&gt;*The flesh. With all the scanners, all the weird shit they get into, how could Amy be the flesh for that long?*

This is partially addressed in *A Good Man Goes to War*, where Rory and the Doctor make a point of noticing that the Silence were able to maintain a flesh signal link 'wherever we were in time and space... they must be incredibly powerful.'

&gt;*The Silence. With all his travelings, of all those years, this is the first time this group has ever formed? I understand not everything is a fixed point, but with his death being a fixed point, wouldn't he have come across this a long, long, long time ago?*

I think there is more to the 'universe reboot' story at the end of last year than meets the eye. If the Silence did blow up the TARDIS, they must have known what the consequences would be. It's entirely possible that the events of Series 6 are a direct result of manipulation by the Silence, and that they were able to prevent the Doctor from finding out about his death until (what they assumed would be) too late.

&gt;*Fourth: River Song. IMO this story is getting a bit outlandish. What am I supposed to be getting out of this?*

The River Song arc more or less seems demonstrative of how travelling with the Doctor can be amazing for those he holds close, yet also extremely dangerous. The 11th Doctor era is very much focussed on the inherent problems of being a 1103-year old Time Lord who continuously fights evil through time and space; at some point your exploits may come back to bite you.

River Song is more or less the result of conflicting viewpoints regarding the Doctor's travels. For some, he's a dark warrior steeped in the blood of the innocent, who one day will fall out of the sky, tear down your world and disappear without a moments hesitation. For others, he's a hero; a man who fights against injustice whenever and wherever it may be, always with the greater good in mind. 

River was born and raised in an environment where she was indoctrinated with the ideas of the former, in order to one day be the person who brings about his eventual death. However, as she becomes further exposed to the alternative viewpoint through her time living alongside Doctor-worshipping Amelia Pond and her eventual studies at the Luna University, she comes to understand how important and well-intentioned of a person he really is. Her falling in love with him was an unintentional result of being brought up with the express intention of being obsessed with the Doctor.",0,1320618813,null,0,true,0,c2xm69e,t3_m2n1b,t1_c2xm69e,t1_c2xlvc9,1427839935,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

&gt; Yes? I imagine he has a great deal more to concern himself with than what his companions do behind closed doors.

Ok, I'll accept that he has a lot on his mind. But! Did he just not know the outcome of two humans that have time-traveled making a baby while in flight? Or did he just forget? I mean, he picked them up on their wedding night. He isn't that ignorant to human customs. I would be more inclined to believe that was his plan for making new time-lords than he just forgot or didn't know. Speaking of making new time lords, what ever happened to Tennants daughter? Anyways...

The flesh: I acknowledge your reference, but a minimal dialogue about it seems... cheap? I feel like with more dialogue, and more clarification, and more scenes showing how they pulled it off would change my mind of the story. 

The Silence: I will take that point into consideration. As more of the Silence unfolds, I hope we see how they managed to do what they do. If it is just blown over, I will be very disappointed. 

River Song:
Your explanation of that story makes me want to see that story unfold. I agree with the synopsis, but to me the execution of the story was lacking.  I can remember specific examples from all of this. But let's take one in particular. Where River Song explains to the Doctor who she is, and the speech about how Doctor means healer or Destroyer. 

Those 5-10 minutes. Did the acting, the build up, and everything surrounding it. Did all of that really build you up for what she was about to say? And when she was done, did your mind go boom? Did you laugh, cry, *have* to talk to other who fans? To me it was so, anti-climatic. It almost felt like a filler episode than anything. 

Maybe I just missed it? What specifically draws you into Smith's Doctor? Can you point a specific episode that did it for you? I would be interested in re-watching it with some of your points of view in mind.

true,joystickgenie,null,null,"Alright I am a Tennant diehard myself. I did start watching Tennant. but only watched one episode before starting the new series over (Smith and Jones). Then I watched all of the new series before exploring the old. I know there is a lot of him being the first doctor I saw and her being the first companion I saw that made me like the two of them the best. 

Since then I have gone back and watched old Doctor Who as well. I watched what people were telling me were the best episodes. Genesis of the Daleks, Pyramids of Mars, Inferno, City of Death, An Unearthy Child, Attack of the Cybermen. 

When going back I did notice there is a definite change in the way the doctor acted now from then. Back in the classic Who it seemed that the doctor treated his companions like a mild annoyance. ""sighs, I guess I have to go save Sara Jane again"". The doctor also seemed to treat his enemies with a same sense of mild annoyance rather then actually taking them seriously. ""No please don't create the daleks... ehh... I tried..."". Like the Doctor was above such a thing and he was lowering himself to help them or defeat them.

It is a very different feeling than the modern Doctors. I would say all three of the modern doctors are much more emotionally involved in their companions and the enemies they face than the old doctors were. I would have a hard time seeing a companion describe the classic doctors the way Amy described the doctor in The Beast Below.

By that I mean, he couldn't control the scene by himself. He needed Piper, Agyeman and Tate there in order to maintain my attention. Every other Doctor I've seen could easily have been by themselves and been just as watchable (not that I'm saying the other companions are unnecessary, of course, they all provide important parts to the programme as well).

true,TX1138,pertwee,Pertwee,"&gt;What specifically draws you into Smith's Doctor?

For the most part, what I've enjoyed about Matt Smith's Doctor is the level of moral ambiguity surrounding his character. Since the revival, there has always been a fairly clear distinction between 'good' and 'evil'. The Doctor, in both his 9th and 10th incarnations is undoubtedly the good guy. His pacifist speeches, such as DocNine's 'coward... any day' and DocTen's 'A man who never would!' go a long way to paint the Doctor as a man who understands the importance of maintaining an inherently 'good' moral standpoint.

With DocEleven, however, we're seeing a number of pre-revival traits resurfacing. Specifically, the degree to which the Doctor is willing to manipulate events to achieve a specific outcome, even at the expense of his post-Time War pacifism. We see the beginnings of it way back in *The Big Bang*, with the Doctor being utterly defeated at the hands of the Pandorica Alliance. It is from here on that the Doctor starts to influence events 'behind the scenes', beginning with his implanting of the story of the TARDIS in little Amelia's mind so as to bring him back from the void.

Episodes like *A Christmas Carol*, *Day of the Moon*, *The Doctor's Wife*, *The Rebel Flesh/The Almost People*, *A Good Man Goes to War*, *The Girl Who Waited* and *The Wedding of River Song* have continuously pushed the boundaries in how much we can really 'trust' this man, even if he has the best of intentions. We've seen him rewrite a man's timeline to suit his own agenda, order the unwitting genocide of an entire species, force his companions out of harms way (ironically, into more), manipulate the beginnings of the flesh, cause an entire army to surrender in under 3 minutes without a drop of blood spilled, kill an older version of Amy, and convince the whole universe that he dies on a specific point.

Smith is very much of a very different mould of Doctor than Tennant was. Whereas Tennant drew his inspiration from the likes of Pertwee and Davison, Smith has moulded his Doctor on the likes of Troughton and McCoy. The former is a fairly traditional 'hero'-type character who fights evil wherever he encounters it (whether it suits him or not), whereas the latter is almost always working behind the scenes, often bringing the fight to the enemy and manipulating events beyond the capacity of those he fights against.

And I think a lot of people don't quite grasp the extent to which that's true of someone coming of age right now. Grow up in the 90s, and you've got a million different repeats. Along with an environment which pushes one very heavily to watching tv. Gaming is a slow release, video is harder to come by, and the internet is a primitive beast to say the least. People who grew up before....2000 or so had the advantage of learning to watch old tv. One gets in the habit of not bringing assumptions about pacing, video quality, overused plot devices, or the like to older shows. It becomes so natural you don't even realize you're doing it. 

Today though? People aren't growing up with that anymore. Or at least not to nearly the same extent.

I work on displays as a pyrotechnician, and I just don't find it very feasible that a £3k 15 minute display could produce enough smoke to significantly obscure visibility 10 minutes after the show finished.  That said, the company I work for (based in Somerset) refused to take on that site a few years ago, as it's too close to the motorway.  That decision I believe was made over fall out (bits of the shells dropping onto the road) and the distraction fireworks cause, rather than smoke.

Quite a few articles reference black smoke now, whether they're all copying each other or not I have no idea.  My money is still either on a bonfire (there have been some accusations levelled at a small holder who was having a fire at the time), or just the standard fog that we get in Somerset that appears out of nowhere.

If you prefer Tennant to Smith, no one is justified in telling you that you're wrong in holding that opinion. But claiming that Tennant possesses a specific 'Doctorish' trait that Smith lacks, without having any sense of perspective gained from understanding how other actors have played the part, is not really valid.

***EDIT***: You know what? I'm going to remedy my statement. I don't know if impactful is a word or not. Because what constitutes as a word is totally arbitrary. It's just based off of a ton of different dictionaries and one will tell you one thing, the other will say the opposite. Language is never black and white, clearly translated (heck German prepositions!). It's all essentially about communication and if you understand the meaning of ""ain't"" or ""heck"" then it's all good right?

Then what the heck is my problem with *impactful*? It's like swearing. It's a ""word"" people use for lack of better description. It's what they say rather than pointing specific reasons as to why something is ""impactful"". Instead of saying something is ""crap"" a person could just state what's getting their knickers in a twist.

The person above us who originally used ""impactful"" has this problem. I don't see the support or what they mean by a lack of ""impactful story decisions revolving around male companions"".

""The only reason to say ""impactful"" is if you are unaware of its standardized equivalents.

""Impactful"" is a wonderful case-study for how words succede of fail in becoming standardized. In this case we witness a noun being adjectivalized by adding the suffix ""-ful."" Accepted transformations of this kind include: ""meaningful,"" ""successful,"" ""fearful,"" and ""beautiful."" All of these words evolved from their nominal counterparts, and became standardized due to their wide range of use. Conclusion: people say ""impactful"" because its formation, and therefore its meaning, is logical. 

Okay, then why not put ""impactful"" in the dictionary and be done with it? 

There are a few things to consider. First, we must understand that the stated purpose of a dictionary is to standardize a language. Whether or not you see the merit in this, it is what dictionaries were intended to do from the beginning. Thus, merely describing a language would not fulfill the dictionary's intended purpose.

With this in mind, we should wonder why ""impactful"" is not currently in the dictionary. This is most likely because the word evolved more recently than others of its kind. I'd hypothesize that the word's usage spread more slowly because it has limited utility due to its quality competitors. In short, its standardization would add little to the language: there are plenty of already standardized words that mean the same thing or are more precise (pivotal, consequential, influential, significant). Since there are older, more firmly established ways of communicating the same idea, the only reason someone would say ""impactful"" is if they were ignorant of the alternatives. 

Someone might argue that there are tons of words in the dictionary with redundant meanings. True, but is this a good thing? Should we feed this fire? I say no—its inefficient. I believe that the dictionary will always be expanding, but at an ever-decreasing rate. It makes no sense to standardize a word that adds nothing to the language just because people use it (that's what urbandictionary.com is for).

To Fogarty's point: there is room in the dictionary for words like ""bromance"" and ""staycation."" These words, like ""impactful,"" are commonly understood, but they also provide more by implying a distinct meaning. You may have noticed my use of the non-word ""adjectivalized."" If there is a standardized alternative that means the same thing, I will be wrong in using it. As I am aware of none, I decided to use it.""

Plus there's more moral ambiguity than ever. The Doctor was most definitely the hero before, but now you wonder. People keep saying the Doctor lies, and they're right. Can you trust this guy? I'm not so sure now.

However, Smith may not seem dark like Tennant, because Tennant's dark is a different kind. He spends his run with internal guilt and baggage that is tearing him apart.

By dark Time Lord power, I mean that during the seventh Doctor's reign you got the feeling that while the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of *something*. This something is alien, it's terrifying, and it's dangerous.

However, it's different from the godlike awe I get from the tenth Doctor. This is where it gets hard to explain. The tenth Doctor's godlike-ness, in my opinion, relates to his vanity. Both are very unique to the tenth Doctor unlike the shallow narcissism of the sixth or fourth.

Where as the tenth Doctor makes you think that he is some kind of lonely god high above us who lives in another plane, the seventh Doctor feels more like a pervasive sense of *otherness*. Dark otherness.

He's another one of my favorite Doctors, because yes, Eccleston's face is awesomely expressive like the second and fourth Doctor's.

What's interesting is that I tell you these things about the seventh Doctor but I don't know how I reached this feeling. Probably because of the story Remembrance of the Daleks. It was my first seventh Doctor story. Strangely enough, no Doctor has ever caught my heart as fast as the seventh has. I don't know why, but there's something compelling about his personality. It's a blend of dignity and humility, comedy and darkness.

But again, how did I get to this conclusion? I'm unsure because unlike the kinds of things you see in The End of Time, the indicators are much more subtle. I think that speaks more about the different styles in television over the decades than it does to Doctors.

If you want to try your hand, know the names of all the Doctor's companion's from the fourth and seventh. Know that Ace McShane is Dorothee McShane. Know what happens to Leela, know Romanadvoratrelundar. Watch the Invasion of Time and the Deadly Assassin. Watch the seventh Doctor. Know LOTS of Time Lord stuff like the Panopticon.

Another good book is Human Nature by Paul Cornell. Originally about the seventh Doctor, this book was adapted for the tenth Doctor story Human Nature-Family of Blood. They're both very different and I like both equally for different reasons. No background knowledge needed :)

--------

Something I want to point out though is, that if you are unused to old tv (I am the worst at dealing with it), there's a good chance you won't catch what I'm saying. I don't mean that to be an insult, but if you start out with an opinion about old tv that was anything like mine, it will take you a long time to realize the differences in style and subtleties.

For example, I started watching classic Who back in June where I generally thought any tv made before 1990 was useless. Besides the odd Star Trek TOS or TNG. I watched the story Edge of Destruction with the first Doctor in which the Doctor and his companions are all trapped inside the TARDIS and are having moments of delirium and fits of violence.

Generally boring and strange, there is an end speech Hartnell makes that I thought was the only redeeming quality. Two days ago I rewatched it, laughed at the speech, and totally melted when the Doctor and his companion Barbara made up. I don't know how I could've missed the emotions and feelings of these characters plain on their face. Those months ago I had once described old Who as looking through a sheet of thick glass and a gray film (or my video quality). Now it's a lot clearer to me.

But the third Doctor is great. He rocks a fantastic dandy outfit, knows Venusian aikido (karate, really) and shares a nice paternal relationship with his companions. The third is one with a strong moral compass and a no nonsense attitude.

Whenever the third talks about the Time Lords and Gallifrey, I sometimes go the feel that the Doctor felt very old. He felt like he came from an ancient civilization. Maybe not in a scary sense but a sense of, this man came from somewhere else and has garnered all kinds of experience and wisdom.

There are episodes in which the third Doctor claims he's thousands of years old. There's a brief scene in the Curse of Peladon (iirc) in which he talks of his childhood.

One of my favorite scenes is in The Mind of Evil (which is unfortunately only in black and white) in which a man questions the Doctor's scientific credibility, saying ""If [the Doctor] were a scientist-""

and the Doctor: ""*If* I were a scientist?! May I tell you, sir, that I *am* a scientist! And I have been for several thousand-""

at which point the Doctor stops himself, takes a breath and storms out.

What's unique about the third is that he's very much an establishment character. Or at least more than any other incarnation. He like to criticize government bureaucracy and calls ""military intelligence"" a contradiction in terms, but due to the nature of his era, he's very much the gentlemen who will only consider those of his calibre to be ""players"".

Basically those two reasons are the same reason, but it's such a good reason it deserves to be two.

The tv movie was a horrible abomination of Fox made-for-tv awful horribleness. Mcgann redeemed himself in the audios, and if he hadn't, I would be ashamed for him to be officially counted as a Doctor.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I liked it in my youth(obviously, it got me into Doctor Who), then couldn't figure out why I liked it as an adult, but have since warmed back up to it.

I think the problem with the movie is it's really the sore thumb of Doctor Who. First of all, it doesn't fit in with either series(Although an often neglected fact is it's technically part of NeWho).  Where you have old Who that was very 60s/70s British television style, and NeWho that is very '2000s scifi/drama' style. Meanwhile you have the movie that is very 90s, and very American.

I think if you can get passed that, the movie isn't half bad(especially with Paul McGann as The Doctor).  The only problem was that it was more of a pilot episode than an actual movie. Which makes sense considering it was meant to spark of NeWho as we know it today. So you ended up with a lot of loose plot threats, and an underdeveloped Doctor. Which, mind you, most of the 'negative' plot threads(like Doctor being half human)have been cleverly retconned in alternate media. So it's kind of hard to even say if it wouldn't have been retconned had the series continued.

Think of it this way. Go back and watch the Eccleston pilot 'Rose'. Now, imagine that was ALL you had to base not only Eccleston off of, but NeWho as well. And, as one last condolence, it was at least better than the Doctor Who reboot that was planned before the movie(Which involved The Doctor and The Master being brothers).",0,1320649309,null,0,false,0,c2xqdlk,t3_m2n1b,t1_c2xqdlk,t1_c2xpir0,1427841928,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

If you have UK citizenship then it should present little problem once you've got registered for National Insurance (an NI number is the UK equivalent of the US Social Security Number.) It's properly referred to as ""Job Seeker's Allowance"", because you only get it as a support while looking for a job. As long as you can prove that you're looking (apply for positions, attend interviews) then you should be set.

&gt; Is healthcare really free?

Yes and no. Compared to the US, there are basically no healthcare costs. There are small costs for some things (prescriptions, dental fees) but if you're on the dole you don't have to pay.

true,JTFirefly,mccoy,McCoy,"I liked Eccleston from the start, and so did everybody else I watched Doctor Who with. Then came Tennant, and the complaining started (""He's just not the Doctor"", etc.). I defended Tennant as best as I could (because he was great), and slowly but steadily the complaints died. Then came Smith, and not only did the complaining start again, it proofed to be more  persistent, probably because Tennant's run was longer than Eccleston's.

I'm the only one in that group who knows any of the old Doctors, and I'm the only one not complaining about actor changes. They've all been great, for very different reasons. Why dwell in the past when you could be enjoying the episodes which are on TV *right now*? It's not like I'm telling people that Eccleston/Tennant/Smith are fine, but they're not Tom Baker or McCoy (""my"" Doctor - don't judge me). Yes, they aren't, but I don't mind - I'm just glad that there are new episodes, which are generally pretty great.

It's not like this wouldn't be tiresome with any other actor (and it happens with Eccleston and Smith too, and every now and then one of the old actors), it's just that more often than not it's Tennant.

He was great, sure, and even we old fans get that (well, most of us, anyway). But he is not *the* Doctor (well, he was, but not anymore ... ah, you know what I mean).
