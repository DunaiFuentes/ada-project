The scene tells one of two things: the Doctor hasn't been to the gamma forests yet or he is so old as to forget events from his own life. Both seem equally likely (the latter gaining validity from the fact that he flat out lies by saying he knows who the girl is b/c/ ""I remember everyone"" and then ten seconds later asking who she even was, proving the Doc  doesn't remember everybody. Then again, he could have been just aware that it was a nice thing to say to someone dying he hadn't *actually* met yet).

Also, the soldier girl's stroy is straight up and down teh definition of ""vague."" All we know is that the Doctor shows up at some point in the gamma forest where he tells a little girl to run. Knowing as the gamma forest people consider ""Doctor"" to be a term for combat, we can extrapolate that they probably didn't start this convention in a ten year span (how old could soldier girl be?), so the Doctor is a legendary figure by the time the kid/future soldier meets him in the forest. My guestimation is that she meets the Doctor as a child, thinking he's a monsterous guy, but he quickly dispells the notion, giving a little girl a reason to switch sides when she eventually becomes a soldier.

I don't think it's self directed study at all, perhaps for the arts, but not for the sciences. (I know you know how the system works, so the next bits are for the benefit of others) 

I have 12 hours of lectures a week, along with 12 hours of practical work and 3 hours of 2 to 1 supervisions. For each of these supervisions I have work to do every week which must be handed in the night before. This work can take anywhere from 1 to 5 hours to complete (leaning towards the longer hours). 

The supervisions are the key, they force me to do work, which otherwise I would never do as I am such a lazy shite. If I have a problem understanding something the supervisors can generally clear it up fairly quickly, I don't need to spend ages looking through various textbooks or online looking for a place which explains the concept better, just wait for my supervision. Admittedly, this really does depend on the quality of the supervisor, but mine this year have been excellent. 

I also don't agree with Cambridge not caring about its students. If I've been getting behind on my work my supervisors will mention it, or may get in touch with my director of studies. The grants and bursaries available are fantastic and there are a lot of support for extra curricular clubs.

I never really wanted to go here, I thought it would be just full of toffs and swots. I'm Irish as well, so the prospect of a load of upperclass English people studying away 24/7 did not appeal.

It's not like that at all, people probably do study a bit more, and you might get more people from private schools than other places but it is still a university full of students. Students who want to get drunk and high and fuck about. 

I think the best thing to know about it is the extra-curricular stuff. If you're into sport, music, drama, stand-up, writing, anything really, Cambridge is fantastic. There's so much stuff to get involved with. The collegiate system means most colleges have their own sports teams and drama societies and magazine etc. so if you're not good enough, or don't have the time commitment to get involved with university team or club you can still get involved at a college level. It's a great way to get involved and meet people.

As it is I've done about 10 plays since I've came here (going up to the Edinburgh fringe with a group over the summer), performed stand up for the first time, become vice president of the University Ireland society, got on my college's university challenge team, became president of my college drama society, played Gaelic football for the university and still had time do get drunk and squeeze in some work around it. If I had stayed at home for uni, I'd likely just be doing my course and that would be it. There is so much to get involved in at Cambridge it's fantastic.

Also, the bursary systems are great.

true,Variant_Peck,null,null,"   This is very well done, but it is missing a few parts to it I think. Mostly a few orbital intrusions in the orbital characters, which probably was missed because they are hard to see in a screen cap.

   As well, the center of the main orbit character doesn't have a tangent line through the center orbit, rather, there are two orbits on either side ‚Äì one dark, one light. And in the same central character, there is a missing interpunct between the second and third orbits. Similar to the one in the center left character. That doesn't seem unimportant because that is one of the few orthographically similar features between Gallifreyan and Old High Gallifreyan, as seen on River's home box inscription.

   Also, although in the Confidential episode Alex Kingston confirmed that it was the Doctor's cot she says the actual question is whether it was only *his* cot. So, this might not be his name. The inscription on the side and foot of the cot do differ, but as mentioned by [denidzo](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/hs8u2/check_it_out_the_doctors_real_name_from_agmgtw/c1xyo2f), they share at least two characters. In fact, these characters have the same position (left-right orientation) relative to each other in both. So, assuming the intrusions, orbits and size vary to give the inscription different semantic values, this is significant. Just a guess, but if the language is actually constructed, then this would probably hint at a similar declension between the two, possibly identifying each inscription as a name, a time lord name or even just a noun.

I cannot speak for politics -- although as I understand it, it's essentially a 'mickey mouse' subject at some universities -- but numerous universities in the UK house academic departments that rival those of Oxbridge.  While no university can match the prestige of Oxford or Cambridge, quite a few certainly can offer similar quality of course and teaching in some of their subjects; several departments also surpass Oxbridge in terms of research quality.  Admittedly, Oxbridge-style tutorials remain the most excellent form of teaching, (unfortunately) exclusive to Oxford and Cambridge.

true,brotherbear,null,null,"Also, when River timewarps onto Demons Run, she turns to Amy at some point (Rory craddling Amy in his arms at the time) and says, ""I know it may not seem it, but you're going to be just fine soon, **Amy**."" It seems odd to leave out Rory's obvious childless grief, especially considering five minutes later she's calling Amy and Rory mom and pops. Perhaps overreaching, but River leaves out Rory because how do you tell someone you've killed (nevermind it being your moffucking dad), ""You're going to be just fine.""

Also, River says she learns how to drive the TARDIS from the best, which falls in line with the idea that River considers Rory a great man and is supported by the various assistance Rory seems to be taking in the maintaining of the TARDIS (minimal as it is).

Rory is a pretty amazing Whovian character: 'purer' than the Doctor, older, lack of arrogance/overconfidence--and it all has been happening in degrees to undo the TIME LORD VICTORIOUS status that Davies left the series at. It used to be that I thought no human could rival the Doctor in amazingness, so how could he settle down with one? Well, River is the daughter of the lady that restarted the universe by remembering it and the most humanistic human (digression: the most human human turned into a robot=Moffat metaphor of Rory's unparalled humanity/love) ever to travel with the Doctor.

If we're going into how Rory can be seen as great, consider the one quality that he has exemplified time and again that the Doctor does not: humility (to a fault at times). Rory the nurse versus Doctor, the *self-proclaimed* doctor. He has zero strive for wowwing people or curiosity to get involved simply to figure out what's going on--something the Doctor does and calls Tuesday. Instead, he doesn't assume he can solve everything, inevitably--save everyone, inevitably. He feels small and mortal (the humility to a fault thing, resulting in the past occurences of 'Amy really loves the Doctor, not me' Rory), and yet has proven to always be there in equal measure as the Doctor. Hell, before River gave the Doctor a talking to this last episode, what other companion has ever criticized the Doctor' choice of actions--Rory! (excerpt: ""You know what's dangerous about you? It's not that you make people take risks, it's that you make them want to impress you. You make it so they don't want to let you down. You have no idea how dangerous you make people to themselves when you're around."") Their equal status stretches to the humorus extent that their mutual wives consider the other man handsome (Amy and the Doctor vs. Rory and the TARDIS)

In essence, it all boils down to the fact that Rory has been building up as unimpeachably morally good. Amy is saucy good, Doctor is sketchy good, but Rory is just pure good. Does rory's character ever have a moral qualm? Amy in Beast Below, Rebel Flesh, Amy's Choice, etc.--they all showcase Amy trying to figure out what the right ethical/personal choice is, but wherever a Rory story is concerned, it's, ""What's in Rory's way of doing what's right?"" He's unquestionable.

Literally my last thought on the Rory being a 'good man' and River's father: how icky would it have been if Rory wasn't older than the Doctor? B/c otherwise, it would just be the Doctor romantically tied to the kid of his best friends, which is creepy.

Good point!

And The Doctor in the first episode was killed by being shot. As an exact copy of The Doctor, FleshDoc *would* have the ability to regenerate, hence the being-shot-during-regeneration thing. Seriously, who knows how a Flesh Time Lord 'Ganger would expire? Sonic, puddle, sure. Shot? Looks like. Shot during regeneration? Looks like. 

Flesh wasn't introduced in this series then forgotten about after a single story, either. It's been used to copy the Doctor, Amy, her baby (didn't name to baby to avoid possible Spoilers for those who don't yet know.) It's been introduced for a reason. 

Random thoughts:

Maybe the figure hiding behind the cabin when The Doctor was killed was a regeneration of someone we recently learned was part Time Lord? AFAIK, there's no law that states they can't change sex, is there?

Remember the little girl in the alley? That was definitely a regeneration, indicating she was dying beforehand. Was the suit she escaped from a life-support system, or something? Why break out of it, then? Did being shot by Amy cause a mortal wound? In which case, *when* did she get out of the suit (as shown by the empty suit) and why get back in it again to kill The Doctor hundreds of years later? 

Why was a Silence watching?

Why did The Silence go to all that trouble to engineer the moon landings so the suit would be *made?* I think they're 'working' for someone, myself. 

Same thing with the Headless Monks, too. 

Not sure who, though (no pun intended.)

true,Variant_Peck,null,null,"Well, I don't ""know"" all of this, it's just a lot of inference from the canon material provided. The original series provided a lot of language examples, often combinations of greek letters and nonsense symbols. These were often treated as modern, or colloquial, Gallifreyan I think. Although Old High Gallifreyan, something not known by many Time Lords, came up in ""The Five Doctors"". As well, the books and comics features the occasional word or phrases, such as using Gallifreyan to number the chapters.

The big thing is most of this speculation comes from a few bits mentioned in canon material. Given the nature of the series, and cost constraints, when the language was initially implemented as a plot element, there was, and possibly still isn't, an actual constructed language in mind. This is evident in the transition from arabic looking script with the fourth doctor, to greek symbols, to hieroglyphs and eventually the circular notation of the cot, also seen on the 10th doctor's TARDIS console.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Yes, definitely. ""Silents(/Silence) will fall"" was a warning not a pat on the back.

That's what gets me. Were they actually *warning* the Doctor, like it was a bad thing to happen?

&gt;""You will tell the Doctor.""

&gt;""Tell him what?""

&gt;""What he must know... and what he must never know.""

This can only really refer to two possible things, and I think it refers to both of them. One thing he must know (Amy's pregnancy), *and* one thing he must never know (his own death): With Amy's pregnancy, they seem to have been warning the Doctor that Amy was a ganger, by prompting him to scan her for pregnancy. 

I suspect the Silents/Silence are actually trying to help. I think they saved Melody from the orphanage, and built an incubating space-suit to keep her alive (she was dying when we next saw her, six months later *{genetic defect?}*).

Yet another race needlessly destroyed by The Coming Storm. I believe the Doctor has so much further still to fall.

*(Edited to add:)*

By letting the Doctor know about his own death, they are playing with him. We know that some things are fixed in time, and have to stay that way. Surely a Time Lord's death is one of these occasions? If not in general, then the Doctor's surely must be. He is The Last of His Kind, after all. By giving him the power to avoid his own death, they are giving him the power and opportunity to break the boundaries of the most basic laws of his kind, and possibly of the universe.

The Coming Storm, indeed.

On a side note, there's also that episode back in Martha Jones' time with the witches and Shakespeare, the one that talks about the power of one's name. I would imagine that for a Time Lord's name to be known could be pretty dangerous in some circumstances.",0,1307324922,null,0,false,0,c1xzrxl,t3_hsfwr,t1_c1xzrxl,t1_c1xzonk,1427216035,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,silentdragoon,blue,gamer,":) I took a masters in computer science; I'm graduating in July.

I really love my department; where other universities I went for open days were stuffy and old, Bristol was fresh and filled with young lecturers passionate about what they taught. My department is the kind of place where there are XKCD comics drawn on the dry-erase walls and image macros are hung up in the computer lab. The atmosphere is just brilliant.

There are also a lot of university societies; I was in the games (e.g. D&amp;D) society and president of the computer gaming (e.g. StarCraft) society; there are tons of others from ballooning to charity, all of which have a lot of members and tons of events.

The city itself is really nice; as others have mentioned Bristol has the amenities of a large city (nice movie theatres, parks, monuments, travel connections) but the atmosphere is one of a smaller city (I came from a city in the US of population 70k, so it was good for me).

Finally, unlike many cities in the UK (particularly up north where I was raised) there are many attractive girls (like my gf &lt;3) who have the added bonus of being fiendishly clever and passionate about their subjects too.

All in all, a fine city and I'd be happy to show you around if you want to see the sights! Probably the places I'd suggest would be Brunel's marvels (Temple Meads train station, Clifton Suspension Bridge, S.S. Great Britain), the Downs (a massive series of fields), the shopping districts (Cabot Circus and Broadmead) and the University precinct (Wills' memorial, various awesome departments).",0,1307325037,null,0,true,0,c1xzscg,t3_hrr21,t1_c1xzscg,t1_c1xyh2h,1427216039,3,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"I love Moffat's run, but a few things are really beginning to irritate me:

1) All of the sexual innuendo. ""I'm a screamer"", the tongue bit, two Doctors for one of River's birthdays, handcuffs. I find it a bit forced and out of place on something that's traditionally been a family show. 

2) Very similar plot resolutions in multiple episodes. Doctor Dances/Black spot are both a medical AI that makes a mistake while attempting to repair humans and nearly causes a disaster. Blink/Time Crash/Big Bang/Space and Time all fall back on ""I know how to solve this problem because someone already saw me do it"".

3) Unnatural dialog in an attempt to be cute. Amy's speeches in Day of the Moon (""I love you stupid head"") and A Good Man Goes to War (""Someone coming...last of his kind...very very old"") both describe Rory in a very obscure way to make us think Amy is talking about the Doctor.

In my opinion, these tropes are starting to be overused to the point of exhaustion. I hope he finds some new tricks or the show will become very stale. 

Edit: One more I thought of. This isn't something I dislike yet but I can picture it being heavily abused in the future. Moffat has mentioned a couple times that every answer should lead to more questions than it solves. So far it has kept show interesting and made for a good story arc. But, when I imagine 5+ seasons of every bit of  resolution making the picture less and less clear, it just seems wearying. Tying up every loose end and starting fresh on occasion isn't a bad thing.

I'm doing a masters next year and expect it'll be a pretty big change coming from an American state school, but there are some things I've not been able to find much about. During my undergrad I did a year at St Andrews, but it doesn't seem like it had a similar culture at all.

* First, I'm assuming (hoping) that there will be a similar tutorial system for the masters courses. It does seem really appealing, but like a lot of other things it sort of seems as though everyone born in Britain has some sort of innate sense of how things work that don't need to be explained. Am I right?

* Second, I'm hoping that I'll actually have some free time to go out and enjoy my time abroad. It seems like I might be quite busy during the week but still probably have time to get involved with some clubs/go out, but I don't know if that will still hold true for grad students. Do you get any sense of the grad students being total lab rats or do they manage to maintain some semblance of a (CS) social life?

* Third, I'm a bit concerned about the time between terms. Does Oxford totally empty out between terms with people going home or will people generally still be hanging around? It seems like a huge break and if I'm sort of stuck by myself or couchsurfing with friends and relatives it'd be nice to know what to expect in advance.

* Finally, I'm curious how much career support there is available. I'm sure there will be career fairs and such, but do you know if companies generally do a lot of recruiting on campus and whether students usually end up finding jobs fairly easily? I'd like to stay in the UK for a few years at least afterwards and I'd like to have some institutional support as far as finding jobs and navigating the work visa laws and such. I'm guessing it's not hard to find a job afterwards, but finding one that would satisfy the income requirement to retain my visa seems a bit harder from the minimal browsing I've done of career websites.

I realize it's a bunch of questions, but if you could answer any (or all!) of them I'd be super appreciative.

I hated the River reveal because it immediately made the writing before that moment stupid (shortsided?). They spent all that time with River and the Doctor flirting (not to mention the overused ""spoilers"" catchphrase) that there were never any real moments [between her and her parents](/spoiler). Imagine if we had known from the beginning? If we knew and could watch River's pain being unable to say anything. [FFS, she appears on the day of her birth. Her mother has been kidnapped and in a moment of horror watchs her child turn to goo. River shows up and flirts with the Doctor and then instead of being straightforward does that whole annoying scene with the crib and the leaf - all for our benefit.](/spoiler) I want to see the characters act realistically.

Your questions 4-7 are all based on the idea that River is the child in the spacesuit. She might be but I think the child in the suit is her and the Doctor's child. Crossing timelines and all that.

I don't think she's actually afraid of the Doctor finding out who she is. It's not the knowledge itself that scares her but the day, because that's the last time she sees him in her personal timeline.

I assume the Ponds will go back to the 21st century if they go back. That's where they ended up after the honeymoon at any rate.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Virgin have always been overselling - even on their new DOCSIS3 capable network, get about four 50Mbit customers in an area and you're up to capacity (the ""area"" is arbitrary but it is probably a few streets or more - maybe an entire part of town). Any more is overselling.

That's a fact of life of residential broadband in general, but the ADSL based ISPs don't have the same issue because the connection between you and their equipment is dedicated (the ADSL part of the connection) and there is often a decently sized connection from their equipment in the exchange to their network.

Virgin likes to tout its ""fibre optic"" network and keep increasing speeds when their network just can't take it. That's why they introduced STM (where you get speed capped for uploading/downloading too much). As for ""fibre optic"", what a crock - it's fibre optic up until a street cabinet but not necessarily the one in your street. From there it's coax to your house - not much better than the cable used to connect to a satellite dish. 

By that logic dialup is fibre optic as the telephone switches in the exchange are connected to each other using fibre optic cabling.

BT might be taking ages to get there, but at least their new FTTC (or FTTP in some areas) network is more capable of handling higher speeds - and it's more than likely fibre optic to your street cabinet - not one in the general area. The technology can go much further than the 40Mbit/10Mbit BT currently has it capped to.

You have to hand to Virgin - their advertising is good, shame the service often doesn't live up to it. A lot of people believe Virgin have some sort of modern network and that Richard Branson is personally responsible for it - and that's what they want you to believe.

Virgin's network barely meets the definition of fibre optic (in the sense of ""fibre optic broadband"", where you expect high speeds and fibre to your home or a cabinet). It is fibre optic to a cabinet somewhere near you, but not necessarily your street. There isn't much capacity for data traffic because of the standards used (it is a standard that allows Virgin to shoehorn data onto a network primarily used and designed for TV transmission). So, as Virgin keeps increasing speeds, it only gets worse. At 50Mbit, roughly 4 to 5 customers downloading at full speed is enough to use up the available capacity.

If their ""fibre optic"" network was so good, they wouldn't have to introduce a system where you get speed capped for downloading or uploading too much.

They use the term ""fibre optic network"" to give their network an aura of quality and pizazz it does not deserve - and people think it is better because BT doesn't yet have their own fibre to the cabinet or fibre to the premises network in many areas and so doesn't try to bend the definition of ""fibre optic network"" to achieve an advertising goal.

My dialup connection was fibre optic - because BT's telephone network uses fibre to connect exchanges together.

Having popped to the states last year on business its clear how driving to eeeeverything is part of the culture. The locals thought it was odd that I walked the mile or two to get some supplies when any normal local would of hopped into their car. This appears mainly down to the fact that the US is massive so everything is spread out as there is room to do so and fuel has always been cheaper than the UK so driving is generally cheaper.

For my own part I used to commute from Portsmouth to Southampton each day which is only about 30 miles each way but could take over an hour each way. This never bothered me but like many other Brits driving any distance is pricey, I love driving to North Wales as its beautiful and is a nice change from the south coast however driving there an back will cost me about ¬£80 (petrol not diesel) which is a lot to someone who is getting buy on less than 16k per year.

My two current theories

1.) She thinks she killed someone, but that person actually lived. I'm thinking fake deaths like Amy and Rory from The Impossible Astronaut.

2.) Killed is used as a metaphor.

I don't think that the girl in the spacesuit and whoever killed the Doctor in TIA is the same person. The girl in the spacesuit broke out of her prison in 1969, right before the ganger Amy was kidnapped by the Silents. Why would she be back in the space suit in 2011?

I suppose it's possible that the Silents possess time travel. They knew where the Doctor would be in 2011 because of the envelopes, so they traveled there with the girl in the suit to kill him (explaining the Silent that Amy viewed on the ridge). Now I'm making this next bit up as I'm typing, but maybe that's why the old Doctor had to invite the young Doctor along. He needed the Silents to think that they had killed him. Kind of like the fake deaths of Rory and Amy so that they could all get to a place where the Silents weren't.

I don't watch the show to see **if** the Doctor will save the day in the end, I watch it to see **how** the Doctor will do it, and I want that to be something smart. I feel like he also overuses ""the Doctor brags about himself/his reputation, causing his enemies to give up even when they have an enormous advantage"". It seems as though he spends more time bragging about himself than actually doing things to deserve it.

Also, there's no point in putting in little ""clues"" about the overarching plot, because the huge plot point in the end is always completely, ridiculously disconnected from anything that could have been predicted. Who correctly guessed ""Amy is a doppelganger made of semen, replaced offscreen!"" from the oscillating pregnancy scanner? Or ""the Pandorica is a giant box made by the Doctor's nemeses that can hold anything, raise the dead, fly into the sun, and recreate history!"" from the ""cracks"" plot?

To be honest, this may be (and hopefully is) the reason Moffat wrote in a bit of Timelord DNA.  It wasn't the meta-crisis that kept Donna Noble from traveling with the Doctor forever, it was contract and actor issues. No actor wants to play the Doctor forever, much less a companion, so if Alex Kingston decides it's time for her to leave the show, there is a way to continue River's story with the Doctor, possibly across multiple incarnations of both.

I hope Moffat is planning big things for the character. I find her interesting, but was afraid her adventures with future Doctors would have to happen off screen, or even worse, that Moffat would retcon the story so that her first meeting is shown with 11 and that be it.  I hope she gets a lot of character development, as the Doctor has grown a lot in nearly 47 years and 11 (official) incarnations.

That plus access to a university library or a budget of a few thousand pounds in textbooks will, hypothetically, get you an Oxford education at home, if only you have the motivation and the intelligence. Your main failing will be somebody to explain things to you when you are stuck.

(Cambridge is of course, not a *typical* top-30 university.) If you went to one of those places, you wouldn't be able to get an Oxford education simply because it's always difficult to make yourself learn more than your exam requires with essentially no payoff. Besides which, exams can actually cause you to forget the examined information. (There was a study done, I can write up a description but I don't have the source.)

If the Tardis indiscriminately translates *everything*, then, as the creators of the machine, you'd probably want that to serve as a detriment to your enemies but still give yourself some advantage.

This is just obviously not true. The top comment when I read it was this: 

&gt; Their chief delusion is that they think they have the power to determine whether or not they are inviting rape. I'm sorry, love, but the rapist has that power. So when a police chief mentions that important fact then you'd be well advised to listen to him. Instead of endangering the lives of good women, women who haven't yet been trained to hate men indiscriminately, by sending the immature message that it's fine to dress anyway, anywhere

This is a pretty common sentiment - dress modestly or expect to get raped. In fact, he says it himself:

&gt; When women wear revealing gear in a pub or a nightclub, they are definitely issuing a sexual invitation

I don't think he actually thinks they're asking to get raped, but he does seem to imply that it's alright to cop a feel or comment on someone else's body if they're dressed in ""revealing gear"". Ask any woman who goes clubbing how many times a night someone grabs her bum.

I don't think he's implying it's ok to cop a feel either, but that making yourself look attractive is a basic human instinct. Everyone, male or female, does it to a greater or lesser degree. It should never been seen as an invitation for molestation, but then if you go out looking attractive and sexy you shouldn't be surprised if you attract the attention of the opposite sex, and most people on a night out would welcome this I'd have thought.

If I'm seriously hurt in a car crash of somebody else's negligence, because I decided I didn't want to wear my seatbelt, I'm must accept that my own actions could have prevented such injury. Nobody absolves the fault from the other driver, but if I had done that one thing, I might have avoided being hurt.

It might be ideal that a woman can wear exactly what she wants without fear of sexual assault, but we do not live in an ideal world. A woman is taking risks by dressing in a provocative way, just as she does if she walks home alone. And they need to be aware that they are taking a gamble.

true,Cadi-T,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"No worries, I'm happy to try answer. I'll just point out now, though, that I am a first year undergrad, so I don't know much about the masters course or jobhunting.

* I would have thought that the tutorials still happen for masters - it is one of the 'things' about Oxford. I'm not quite sure what you mean about an ""innate sense of how things work""... If you mean that you're struggling to find details about tutorials on the website, that's probably more Oxford being ""well it's obvious"" than Britain as a whole. 

* I don't see much of the grad students, because they tend to live out of college. But I'm fairly sure they still have time to have fun - there's one guy doing a postgrad who I've talked to a couple of times, and he still seems to be having a good time. I wouldn't worry too much - it's probably just a matter of organising your time well.

* The vac is very long, I'll agree with that. Most of the undergrads will empty out, because they're probably living in college accommodation, which has to be totally emptied over the holidays.

The Doctor becoming a warrior has had demonstrably negative effects on individuals and societies throughout space and time. The Doctor isn't just a warrior: he's an arrogant and reckless one, a hero only to the extent that he can show off how clever he is while saving the day.

In contrast, Rory is measured and thoughtful, humble and humane. Maybe no less reckless (look at how he ran after Jennifer in the ganger episodes), but he's motivated by his compassion, not his ego. Remember his first conversation with River: the Centurion armour was the Doctor's idea, not Rory's. I think that says a lot about what kind of ""warrior"" each man is.

If I'm feeling lazy there's usually very little traffic so  it takes five minutes.  Since then I've had to start working on different sites which I don't like though I do get to claim for my fuel.

As for non-commuting driving, I'll happily drive four or five hours to see friends or go for a weekend away but not particularly often as the cost is prohibitive.

No, of course I don't. But trying to be one way at odds with your environment is ridiculous. To get dressed up as a self-confessed slut and go into a nightclub full of drunken people and to expect that, of all the women there, *you* are not to be touched is ludicrous. Do I think this because I think it's a good thing to grope women in clubs? No, and I have never done it. But do I think this because I know it will happen whether she wants it to or not? Yes.

A (very) short skirt, a crop top, high heels ... these are all worn by women to make themselves attractive. If they are worn with style and in a civilised place (a restaurant, say, or some similar environ) then all well and good. I'm sure a few men will be attracted and may steal a glance, but nobody will put their hands on anyone. She may be offered a drink, or someone may start talking to her in a flirtatious way. I daresay that a single women who dressed in such a way does so for the benefit of others, or rather, so attract the attention of others. 

But to dress the same way and to wander the streets at night amongst the drunken and the stoned; to go into darkened clubs and late bars; to walk home alone in the dead of night on (almost) deserted streets; even to accept a lift in a stranger's car (which is something a depressingly large number of young women do after a few shots or glasses of wine) ... well, that's just stupidity. It is 100% the rapist's fault and responsibility to choose to rape. But it is 100% the responsibility of the individual to think sensibly and rationally about the situations they place themselves in. 

It is not the girl's **fault** they she was raped. That is still 100% with the rapist. But to taunt the bear and expect the bear to not respond by its nature is utterly ridiculous.

It's really depressing that these self-evident truths cannot be shared. I full expect to be downvoted, ridiculed, called a potential rapist and misogynist. Because I have been called these things before. But it does not change the fact that just because it's a woman's **right** to do something does **not**, in **any way** make it automatically a good idea.

If your intrested in helpdesk roles i would get on the job sites (fish4jobs, reed ect. The main thing i have found with these is to put in as many tecnical keywords as you can. Often recruiters just search based on these, and locate people they want. I have had quite a few emails about jobs that i have not seen advertised.

I found i had to increase the search area as there are few long term roles within brighton. I now commute up to burgess hill, which is only 20-30 mins on the train (door to door) or by car.

Where I work would have to be accessible by public transport though, ideally by train. The fact that my current job is based in a town that's on my local railway line was a factor in my choosing the job.

The train service is [generally good](http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/Performance/), although the service is only one train in each direction per hour, as I'm out in the sticks in North Wales. To do it by bus would require two or three separate journeys and would probably take three times as long...

There's a ~10 minute walk at each end of the journey too, which is good in the spring and summer with light evenings and warm weather. In winter when it's dark by 4pm and cold, not so good.

A threat, no matter how slight, will disturb that calm. As a Zanshin-shi might put it, ""As someone thinks to attack me, that person's Ki comes toward me. I have only to follow the Ki, and I will know the source of the attack.""

This ability is one of readiness and awareness. Training involves being constantly on the alert, even while sleeping or in the bathroom!

The martial artist will INSTANTLY sense anybody who enters his/her Zanshin circle, including animals and even those with intangibility and/or invisibility (although he/she still can not see the invisible).

BONUSES: +6 to initiative, +2 to parry, +4 to dodge, and can not be suprised from attacks from behind. When fighting an invisible foe (or a character with superhuman speed) these Zanshin bonuses do not apply, but his/her other combat skills remained unimpaired due to his mystic awareness (this character does NOT suffer the usual penalties from fighting an invisible or superhumanly fast foe).

Characters with this ability also have a reduced form of Ki Awareness that allows them to evaluate the Ki of anyone they can see who is inside their Zanshin circle.

Rape wasn't exactly what I was getting at, as rapists can be beyond all logic and understanding. 

But in the case of lewd comments, the odd feel, wolf whistles etc.

&gt;Its also not ""doing what they want"" its about feeling comfortable. 

No. Not in the slightest. Feeling comfortable is ""doing what they want"", as is dressing to impress your friends, or dressing to attract some attention from the opposite sex. You cannot say that girls dress to feel comfortable because girls go out for many different reasons.

&gt;Why are they so bad for attempting to demand a better society? Why such hostility to their movement? Its not like civil rights in the 1950s or anything big like that but I do feel that they have a valid point and enough of them want to make it that maybe we should stop and reconsider our default positions.

What are they protesting? Is it that women should not accept any responisblility for rape? Is it that women want to reclaim the word ""slut""? Is it that women should be allowed to wear whatever they like? Is it that men shouldn't even look at women in a sexual way? Is it that women shouldn't be objectified (in the way that they do it for men)?

The original protest has now become, as the article author put it,

Chelsea is currently a team made up of superstars (at least among the first 11). I may be wrong, but I just can't see any of these three becoming superstars in the future. Mancienne couldn't cut it at Wolves, and Tore/Sala never wowed me at Chelsea either.

I think that the Chelsea youth system as it exists right now is meant to sift through a pool of young, exceptional talent and figure out what few players are of enough quality to contribute to the future of Chelsea's first team. Mancienne/Sala/Tore will probably end up being good, first-team talent at a club somewhere in Europe. That being said, I don't think they will have near the future that players like McEachran and Kakuta will have. So as unfortunate as it is to say goodbye to some quality products from the Chelsea Academy, I have to say that I agree with the youth policy as it has been implemented so far. Ideally there would be more youth products that make it into the first team, but if they are not good enough, there is no reason to force the matter.

I did misread the title as ""guys"" rather than ""gays"".

So perhaps he's not so much homophobic as just has some sort of weird issue.

&gt;  I'm by no means against having gay characters, I'm just against forging any character traits that seem disconnected to the plot. 

If you think that Amy's short skirts were ""connected to the plot"" then please explain that to me, because as far as I could tell, it was purely there to excite male viewers.

Honestly, the fat one and the thin one were just people, they had a relationship - if they had been a male and female couple, their relationship could have been their 15 seconds of screen time.

Or maybe they could have talked about how they enjoy kite flying.

They were the ""we're just some people who are here"" characters, they happened to be gay.

Who the fuck cares?

&gt; I was more distracted by the ""interspecies erotica"" of the lizard woman and the human woman than the fact that they're both women.

What the fuck is so ""distracting"", aside from the fact that inter-species isn't really something you're personally into?

true,Atman00,null,null,"Copy/pasted from a couple other responses I gave, my take on Lorna and the people of the Gamma Forest.

&gt;The emotional arc of this episode is the Doctor struggling with everyone in the cosmos viewing him as a weapon, and a warrior, and all of these things that he hates. That the word doctor means great warrior to them is incredibly hard for him.. The Doctor is realizing that he is his own ideological opposite, that his legacy is not one of healing and helping, but of war and fear and death.

&gt;Lorna came in search of the Doctor, she was the one who showed empathy to Amy, who realized what the Clerics were doing was wrong. This goodness couldn't have come from her one word encounter with the Doctor, it came from her people.

&gt;We aren't told a lot about the Gamma Forests, but what we do learn paints a great picture. Gamma Forests are neutral in the war. She calls Gamma Forest a boring place, where 30 seconds of the Doctor is the only interesting thing to ever happen. Basically, a peaceful place. Even the name conjures up a rather idyllic setting. Basically, Lorna and her people are the only grounding of peace in this episode, of ideals the Doctor strives for. Every other character, every conversation, every scene in the entire episode revolves around violence. And those are the people whose word for warrior is doctor. That's so much more effective than any reference they could make.

&gt;There was also another way this episode built the theme of the Doctor's legacy of violence, and that was through his companions. Most of the people we saw were indebted to him; This was their penance and redemption. Lorna is important because she was the companion he didn't recruit. She sought him out. The Doctor crashed on her world and said one word to her. His encounter was as fleeting as it gets. Probably a fairly boring day for the Doctor, not even worth telling to us; and from this, he inadvertently turned her into a weapon and got her killed. I can't think of a more effective way to build this theme than that.

So many people dismiss her as just a cheap plot device to introduce the prayer leaf, or they assume she must be really important later.

The astronaut killed the doctor, the suit was apparently a life support for the child, the child seemed to have escaped, and then the child regenerated. Following from the original goal, we can probably be safe in saying the child was River, who regenerated.

true,Booze-And,null,null,"&gt; Amy's short skirts were ""connected to the plot"" then please explain that to me.

Aside from they way a person dresses can reflect their personality, her outfit choices specifically came into play when she first met the Doctor as an adult, having the cop uniform as a costume when he thinks she's really a cop. Also, in the Time minisode when Rory gets distracted looking up his wife's skirt thru the glass floor, the TARDIS ends up inside itself. Sure it was only like 10 minutes combined, but her short skirts were the cause of the whole thing. Most of the time I don't really notice Amy's outfits (aside from people saying she didn't change clothes at all this season, when she did).

&gt;Honestly, the fat one and the thin one were just people, they had a relationship - if they had been a male and female couple, their relationship could have been their 15 seconds of screen time.

The **really** distracting thing was the whole speech about not needing *actual names*. If they would've cut that, gave them names, and had the one say to the other ""see you back in the bunk sweetie,"" and kiss goodbye, it wouldn't come across as ""forced diversity."" The distraction is saying ""we're the fat/thin gay married anglican cleric marines."" Without that, you would figure that out on your own, making it seem more like a natural part of the character than shoving it in your face. Also, in general having two soldiers (of either sex) in a relationship with another soldier is unusual. I know a fair number of soldiers and I don't know any who are married to, or dating other soldiers. Hell, having a married couple where both of them work in the same job/office regardless of what it is pretty unusual.

&gt; What the fuck is so ""distracting"", aside from the fact that inter-species isn't really something you're personally into?

Well I've had reptiles as pets so I know about their biology. Silurians were already noted as being cold blooded in the 2-parter last season, so indicators of arousal like blushing, fixing your hair, etc. wouldn't be present in the same way. Reptiles have very different sex organs, most obviously a lack of mammary glands in females, and females have a cloaca which is essentially a urethra, colon, and vagina combined into one. Plus, Silurians have toxins delivered by the tongue, last season a tongue delivered toxin killed Tony Mack. Other Silurians could probably be immune to it, but not humans, so can they kiss? etc. etc. etc.

&gt;Clearly you've missed the many discussions around here complaining about the amount of homosexuality in Torchwood, and all the people bitching about Davies ""gay agenda"".

Well we aren't talking about Torchwood. But if you want to go there, I think Torchwood has bigger problems than characters sexuality.

In the other he was trying to explain (in an unfortunately patronising and naive-sounding American accent) why the monarchy was good for Britain, completely disregarding and ignoring any contrary arguments and without any citation of opinions.

A quick check of the youtube account also shows a woefully basic and unnecessary breakdown of the Union Jack and couple of videos about British voting systems and their pros and cons.

I'll admit that it's probably more annoying because he's American and talks like an excited but uninformed child.

""Kissogram"" is the *only* profession where someone might dress up as a cop? I'm not convinced.

In any case, it's not the fact that she's a girl that bothers me - it's the fact that any ""I find amy atractive"" post is instant karma, just like any ""I'm sick of all the gay characters"" posts.

I don't care if the show has gratuitous mini skirts, or gratuitous gay people, or even gratuitous kite flying. Either both are acceptable, or neither are acceptable.

&gt;  Also, in the Time minisode when Rory gets distracted looking up his wife's skirt thru the glass floor

Yes, ""look, a girl, she's in a skirt"" was quite definately gratuitous.

Pointing out that they use heterosexuality in the show is hardly refuting the ideas that they use heterosexuality in the show.

If Rory was in love with a gay scotsman wearing a kilt, the kilt would have suited the character and there would be an outcry over the ""gay agenda"".

&gt; Well I've had reptiles as pets so I know about their biology.

Seriously? You actually had time to think in detail about the biology and figure out how it's far more ridiculous than a box that's bigger on the inside?

I must have seen a seriously cut-down version.

&gt; Well we aren't talking about Torchwood

You did bring up Davies. He was somewhat involved in Torchwood.

Also, you said ""I find it odd that Moffat seems to throw characters who aren't heterosexual somewhat bluntly"" and people make that complaint about Davies much more often, yet there have been *two* references to homosexuality and suddenly we're having a huge debate.

Moffat may not be the best writer of gay characters ever - but the fact that it's such a huge concern says more about the people complaining than it does about Moffat.",0,1307409352,null,0,false,0,c1y70k7,t3_ht71j,t1_c1y70k7,t1_c1y6lo1,1427219510,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

It's not so much about being insular or terrible about other cultures and countries, and more about delivery and the challenges of portraying witty rapid-fire dialog and obscure technobabble and cultural references with regional dialects over dramatic music. 

In my own case, I just have real trouble with languages and understanding heavy accents. This is despite the fact that I was born in Germany, and raised across Europe and the US (my dad was US Army). I went to an international school in Belgium, where I had friends who ~~were~~ are Spanish, German, Greek, Italian, French, *and* British. I have a good Dutch friend who I play online games with over voice chat. I often can't understand him, but he knows it and we have a great time. And I happen to *read* several other languages to some degree just fine. Hope I'm not just dropping credentials here, but I hope it shows where I'm coming from, and why I think you're so far off.

It's a bit of a cultural issue with the show, but not a big one. Judging by the responses here apparently I'm not the only one who has a slight issue with it. It's more a potential area of improvement in the audio quality of the show. Maybe they can pace the dialog just a little bit, or boost the mic audio.

&gt; The bootstrap paradox is a paradox of time travel in which information or objects can exist without having been created. After information or an object is sent back in time, it is recovered in the present and becomes the very object/information that was initially brought back in time in the first place. Numerous science fiction stories are based on this paradox, which has also been the subject of serious physics articles.


They also mention Doctor Who in the wiki:

&gt; In the 2010 season finale The Big Bang, the Doctor jumps through time all throughout the episode in order to ultimately restore the universe. In each instance, someone shows up in the right time and place because of a message left by the Doctor, who proceeds to go back in time to leave the message that summoned them to the right place and time. Interestingly, the Doctor specifically avoids a physical item bootstrap paradox twice, once when leaving his sonic screwdriver with Rory 2,000 years in the past, and the next when leaving a note for Amelia on a museum brochure the night before.

My only criticism about Moffat's use of gay characters is **he isn't very good at writing them,** so they seem forced in, not a natural part of the story. Also, I've seen no ""I'm sick of the gay characters"" threads. If this is one, I didn't read that subtext, but maybe I'm being too literal.
 
&gt; ""Kissogram"" is the only profession where someone might dress up as a cop? I'm not convinced.

Aside from cop and stripper (which I do NOT think would fly for a character on saturday nights at 6:40pm), I can't think of any job that would reasonably involve a cop outfit. Can you? I think making her a ""kissogram,"" especially in a tiny town where everyone knows everyone else, says something. The Doctor first met her when she was this brave, smart, kid with the whole world ahead of her, and after the Doctor didn't come back, she didn't do anything with her life. She got some crappy, degrading job that doesn't require her to be brave, or smart, or anything other than pretty. I think in that aspect we're really supposed to pity Amy.

&gt; Pointing out that they use heterosexuality in the show is hardly refuting the ideas that they use heterosexuality in the show.

I wasn't refuting that point, I was only noting 2 instances where her outfits drove the plot forward. You had asked me to point out where Amy's short skirts were connected to the plot. It happened exactly twice (or 1 and a half times) in 1 and a half seasons. Your hypothetical about a scotsman in a kilt is just that, hypothetical. All I can say is that *I* would not think that was forcing an agenda, I'd think it made sense for that character (unless it was the first time he ever wore a kilt after seeing him for a whole season, and he never mentioned being proud/enthusiastic about his Scottish roots)

&gt; You actually had time to think in detail about the biology and figure out how it's far more ridiculous than a box that's bigger on the inside? 

Well yes; the first bit kinda popped into my head in about half a second, after realizing they were an item, and the bit about the toxin occurred to me the instant the Silurian knocked out the guard. It's a matter of suspension of disbelief. After repeated viewings over 6 years, I've accepted a box that's bigger on the inside. This was something new, that I haven't seen brought up on the show, so yes it is more ridiculous for the time being. I had similar concerns about the half pig-man and his showgirl girlfriend in Daleks in Manhattan, which was only *slightly* less confusing because they're both mammals.

&gt; You did bring up Davies. He was somewhat involved in Torchwood.

I brought up Davies because the assumption is that the homosexual RTD would have more of an incentive to include gay characters than the heterosexual Moffat, showing that it's a bit out there to accuse Moffat of ""forcing an agenda"" that doesn't affect him directly (other than, you know, basic equality in human rights). 

&gt;the fact that it's such a huge concern says more about the people complaining than it does about Moffat.

I don't think it's a very big concern at all. The lesson to take away is that Moffat needs to get a script consultant or ghostwriter to write his gay characters, otherwise it seems to be doing more harm than good, writing them as stereotypes. And I think the way to do that is to have more subtlety, and show gays on earth in the past when people were just as gay but nobody talked about it.",0,1307414896,null,0,true,0,c1y7mp8,t3_ht71j,t1_c1y7mp8,t1_c1y70k7,1427219800,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

i could be wrong, but that's my feeling on the matter at the moment.

if they *are* in fact hooded figures, then the silence would seem most likely (except for the fact that they are always shown as wearing suit and tie, rather than cloaks).  that they could be headless monks seems like a retarded theory - every other race except for those living on earth at the time of the explosion was wiped out instantly until after the reboot; this would include the headless monks.


one thing that *did* stand out to me during this watch-through, though, was this (MAJOR SPOILERS for anyone who isn't caught up to the current episode): [how the hell did river get to amy's wedding?  think about it for a minute - river said that they would all wake up exactly where they should be, except that the doctor would never have existed.  if the doctor had never existed, then melody would never have been conceived on the tardis and wouldn't have a time head.  consequently, there would be no reason for eyepatch lady to steal melody and take her to (ultimately) the 51st century, where she would start her own time-travelling saga.  because of this, by my reasoning, until amy brought the doctor back, river as we know her could not have existed - she hadn't even been conceived.](/spoiler)

my point is this... if the doctor had never existed, why was river who she was?  she couldn't possibly have been.  she couldn't have been conceived on the tardis, as it didn't exist.  she couldn't exist at all, she would only exist as what i can only imagine is a particularly painful set of blueballs on rory as he waits for the wedding party to be over.

what i mean by all this is that unless the doctor exists, she isn't a time traveler, and thus wouldn't have the diary that she gave to amy (i'm fairly certain the diary was given to river by the doctor on one of their first meetings, completely filled out in his hand).  because amy wouldn't have been able to receive the diary, the doctor wouldn't have been remembered.

My hunch is that because everything is unique, there won't be a way to properly scale this so it doesn't look like crap on widescreen and/or normal screens. 

I've looking at something like [r/starcraft](www.reddit.com/r/starcraft). Notice how well it scales, even when you maximize/shrink the window? I think the reason is because the right end of the banner just loops so it doesn't matter if part of it gets cut off or not. The actual image itself is [here](http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2qpp6_38.png?v=4tkzoehxvi62m6mw2uxbn759j6qtsvm69ul6).

So, ideally if we can the Bridge in our header, we should have the picture of the Bridge somewhere in the middle, with a plain section on the left (for the header/reddit alien - I've requested an updated one) and repeating background to the right that makes the image very wide. Again, I think that 80-90 pixel height is the magic number, so the Bridge must fit within that constraint.

I'm shit at photoshop but I'll see if I can get a friend to help me out here. Might be a good idea to have a blue sky as the background then the Bridge in the middle.

Similar to the time with Donna, it's nice that he just has a best buddy, rather than some will-they-or-won't-they sexual tension trope between the Doctor and his hot companion every episode.

However, I don't really think Omega fits the bill for being behind all of the events that have taken place so far. I've seen The Three Doctors but not the episode(s) where he goes up against the fifth doctor. From what I saw in The Three Doctors he had an insanely huge ego and would rather go up against the Doctor himself than ever use an army or go around manipulating and tricking other people into acting for him. An attack on the Doctor by Omega seems like it would come in the form of a highly advanced and dangerous weapon or Omega's own force of amazingly powerful will. In The Three Doctors, Omega had disabled all of Gallifrey and was up against three incarnations of the Doctor at once. He fought them without his own body which had faded away and was using his willpower alone across Universes. Omega just doesn't seem the type to be recruiting lowly humans to fight battles for him.

That said, there is the fact that Amy's daughter appears to have [dna similar to a time lord's](/spoiler).

true,jgroome,english,"So I typed back ""lol ok""","Not useful.

For future reference, if anybody says ""as useful as a..."" they're probably trying to tell you that the item in question is NOT useful.

This saying can be emphasised by pointing out a task that requires certain attributes (in this case, holding boiling hot liquid) would not be well performed by the item in question; in this case, a marzipan teapot.

As you can imagine, a marzipan teapot would just melt and leak tea everywhere. This is an unacceptable outcome. I strongly discourage you or anybody else from attempting to make a teapot out of marzipan with the goal being functional use.

Having said that, a marzipan teapot made for ornamental purposes would be different, although I personally subscribe to the old Wilde philosophy, i.e. ""All art is quite useless"". Making such a teapot would be quite a bold artistic statement, especially if you were able to treat the marzipan to the extent that it could hold boiling water. But then you have to ask yourself whether it's truly a marzipan teapot at this point.

Other examples: 

""As useful as a tennis racket with no strings""

You'd use a tennis racket to hit a tennis wall during a game of tennis. This is only possible if the tennis racket itself has strong strings to form a barrier against which the ball can bounce. A tennis racket without strings is therefore not at all useful. You could, however, still use the racket as a regular blunt instrument - as a hammer, for instance, or, by setting fire to the inside of the loop, a tiny ring of fire for your all-chihuahua stunt team. But since you would be unable to use it for its intended purpose (playing tennis), a tennis racket with no strings is an example of something that is useless.

""As useful as a chocolate fireguard""

You'd use a fireguard as a measure of protection next to a fire. Fire is inherently hot and dangerous, but it keeps us warm, so some people like to keep fires in their home. A fireguard acts as a kind of protection both from things going into the fire and from fire escaping the designated fire area and affecting the user. A fireguard therefore needs to be heat resistant. However, a chocolate fireguard would just melt almost immediately after exposure to a fire. This renders the chocolate fireguard useless. However, a chocolate fireguard would still be usable as a piece of chocolate. So while the chocolate fireguard may have its uses as a (rather generous) tasty treat, as a fireguard it would fail in its basic function.

She asks, ""Can't you read?"", refering to the Doctor's cot. His name is on the side, which he looks at. 

**Point two**

When the Doctor is gone she tells Amy and Rory that she [River] is their daughter.

**Why I find it ambiguous**

To me it seemed like she was telling the Doctor that she was a future incarnation of *him*. It is feasible that could regenerate as a girl. At this point the Doctor doesn't read the leaf, he has read his name on the side. It's almost like she is telling him, ""I'm you"", wink, wink.

However, she is really Amy and Rory's daughter. Maybe River telling the Doctor this lie has future consequences, maybe to help the Doctor, or maybe to steer him to death. The Cardinal in Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone told him not to trust her.

Ofcourse the Doctor's reaction is ambiguous too. Replay that scene but with the consideration that River IS a future incarnation. Where one might see him acting awkward that he's just kissed Amy and Rory's, someone else might see him as acting awkward at the revelation that he has kissed himself.

true,namesaremptynoise,mccoy,McCoy,"I'm just going to offer an opinion here, keep in mind it probably has little basis in fact, it's just my analysis of it.  There are, I believe, two major contributing things to the way Moffat writes.

* 1 He got his start in soap operas.  You can still see it sometimes(The whole constant Rory/Amy/Doctor triangle that kept getting dragged back into the story was a real annoyance to me most of the time) in the way he writes.  I don't mean this so much critically as just a note, the way you get your first real acclaim in writing tends to influence you forever after(just look at what it did to Frank Miller and realize how much worse it could be).

* 2 Moffat's a self-admitted life-long Doctor Who fan...  I think the other part of why he writes the way he writes is that he misses the old days when each 4-8 part arc of the show was like its own miniature movie.  Even in the RTD era, two of the four projects he directly wrote were two-parters, and if you really take a step back and look at it, both 'The Girl in the Fireplace' and 'Blink' may very easily have started out as much longer scripts that got pared down to run in one episode(I have no knowledge one way or the other on this, just wildly speculating).  It may be that he's not good at writing shorter stories... Or it may be that he wants to slowly shift the show back to its old format of being more like a proper serial than a contemporary episodic television show.  ...In fact, if you take out 'The Black Spot(which I thought held up rather well on its own)' and 'The Doctor's Wife(which also felt a little cut-down to me... and rather like Amy and Rory's part of the story got shoe-horned in[though the glimpse of what losing Amy again would do to Rory was *fascinating*] and it should've just been about the Doctor and Sexy)'  You actually have something close to part of a serial in the classic formula.  [The Doctor gets killed, which leads into the fight against the Silence, they're seemingly defeated...  Except something's still terribly wrong with Amy, so the Doctor drags everyone off to somewhere random because he needs to study the Flesh, which leads to the big reveal about goo-Amy, then everybody has to go out into space to get her back but zomg the baby is River, IT'S A GOO BABY!  Time to go get little-girl River back!  Which will be the next arc.](/spoiler)

Also, just ignore fanboys of any stripe, imo.  I thought series 5 was a little rough and I had a lot of trouble getting interested, but I never tried to say ""zomg THIS SHOW IS SO TERRIBLE WITHOUT RTD I WILL NEVER WATCH AGAIN! /wrist""  Everyone's tastes are different.  Just tell them to watch the damn show, enjoy the parts they enjoy, and remember that YMMV always applies.

Also, strong rumours regarding Stewart Downing. Infact, we're firm favourites to sign him. I wouldn't mind him as a backup, he seems to have a pretty good cross on him, but once again the same rumours are suggesting fees upwards of 15m - because he's English.

Regarding Juan Mata, the rounds on Twitter certainly haven't gone dead. His name seems to be circulating the most along with Henderson, Adam and Downing as it seems we're missing out on Young and Mata is the next target.

This isn't how I did it, but it is what I would do if I were to make another one. I used the [sonic screwdriver flashlight](http://www.geekalerts.com/u/Doctor-Who-Eleventh-Doctor-Sonic-Screwdriver-Flashlight.jpg), and a green laser pointer. It's important that your laser pointer takes only 1 AAA battery, and is very thin.

1) Take the screwdriver apart. remove all screws, and rip out the LED and battery pack.

3) you will need to remove some of the interior plastic, unless you found a really thin laser pointer. I used a kitchen knife heated over a candle.

4) Widen the screw hole to make a hole for the button to pop through.

5) If needed glue modeling clay/paper/whatever ontop of the laser pointer button in order to make it high enough to press easily. 

6) Slide the laser pointer into the top half, align the button, and glue securely. Wait until dry.

7) Slide the bottom half of the screw driver onto the laser pointer, align and glue. 

8) You will probably need to re-paint the bronze colour at least around the break, and the button. I used modeling paint.

9) Let the paint dry, and you're done.",0,1307457961,null,0,false,0,c1yak2b,t3_htkkc,t1_c1yak2b,t3_htkkc,1427221180,27,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,27

Don't watch episodes with more than 4 parts? I guess I'll skip the second serial that introduces the Daleks, then. Oh, and fuck Pertwee's whole first season. 

Stay away from the black and white episodes until you're well and truly indoctrinated? Why? Is this written for people who have never seen a tv show or movie that was filmed before 1965? For fuck's sake, if I can watch I Love Lucy or The Honeymooners, I can watch Troughton.

Everything about this article is retarded. There are about 700 hours of the show. There are also a shitload of missing episodes. If you start from the beginning, you'll be up to Tom Baker before you know it. You'll also have a better understanding and appreciation for the development of the characters, the villains, the writing, the cultural changes over time, and the quality of the effects.

What meaning will losing a Doctor really have if you start off with the 8th and bounce your way around the show? When Troughton's Doctor was forced into becoming Pertwee, I was really bummed, because I loved the way his Doctor had developed. When Pertwee's Doctor was regenerated, I was also really sad, because I had not only built up a respect for his portrayal of the Doctor, but I had a respect for the actor and his treatment of the fans in his life. 

When Sara Jane Smith was dropped off, I felt a genuine loss and knew what Elizabeth Sladen had done for the role of the companion. Sladen's life and death had more of an impact on me because I was able to see and understand what foundation she was building on, which was my whole point of watching the classic episodes.

If you really love 2005-present Doctor Who and want to know where all the great classic characters and storylines started, there's really no better place to start than the beginning. 

I am dumbfounded by the fact that so many people in here pick their favorite episode or the start of their favorite Doctor or companion as a great place to pick up the show. 

We have the technology to start from the beginning. If you want to *really* appreciate Tom Baker, don't fucking start with him. You'll understand him so much better if you know where he came from. If I started with Baker, I don't know if I'd have been able to love Pertwee as much as I do. If  I started with Pertwee, Hartnell would have been unbearable.

You can leave the Union but you can't claim the Union, even in part, and take it with you.  No one country owns the Union or owns shares in it.  That's the precedent.  The Union very much is a separate entity in its own right as is the Union Treasury.  It's not a marriage, it's more like a corporate group with an umbrella company.  A subsidiary can't lay claim to the group conglomerate.

The Treasury is in no position to divvy up its assets and to give them away anyway.  If Scotland drops out of the Union the Treasury has no right to give anything away to those outside the Union, unless its acted on in Parliament.  You'd need a new Act and there's not a single reason why the majority of English MPs, the majority of all MPs, should play fair for the detriment of England and the Union and at best the Welsh and Northern Irish MPs would be split.

Even if hypothetically we did go down the specious 'divorce settlement' argument, Scotland would still get a fraction of the RBS to the Union's majority share anyway we look at it, the banks would still leave, but Scotland would also inherit their share of their debt too.  So now they have no financial district, a massive debt burden.  It's sad to say but I think when Scots talk about breaking from the Union they expect the 'Divorce' analogy and all the oil fields, and the financial services, and the level of spending.  It simply won't be the case.

I didn't have a winter coat for several years because of the cost of school uniforms and blazers. In my early teens I got packed off to my grandparents during summer holidays - it was a welcome relief.

I had a friend at school whose single mum was struggling to pay a mortgage, so they lived on beans most of the time. They *did* get to go to (participate in) dance competitions though, so I guess that was where their little spare cash went. In some ways people who're trying to be independent of welfare end up worse off. We certainly were when my mother went that route.

In the end, if you're at the bottom of the pile you lack choice and autonomy over your life. You can't easily take yourself out of the damp housing if you're there, you can't choose better quality food and your stuck with poor quality and old hand-me-down clothing etc.

That stuff attracts health problems and bullies, which makes it harder to do well at school, along with the lack of resources and study space at home. Three of my cousins dropped out of school without GCSEs due to bullying.

That said my childhood shaped who I am. The hatred of that helplessness is ingrained into me. I just wish more people had the same reaction as I did- to fight against it. I was lucky enough to still manage decent exam results and to get in my school teacher's good books. I guess that encouraged that fire whereas most have it put it out by their experiences.

true,Robotochan,cnty-england,Ashby-de-la-Zouch,"&gt;Which leads me to believe that a significant amount of anti-immigration sentiment is purely based on xenophobia.

It's not xenophobia, although that may well be a part of it. It is more that another culture is affecting our own society, rather than an irrational hatred of foreigners. (I'm sure there's a term for it, but I've not a clue)

As we have both said, one way or another, the attitudes to certain nationalities/ethnic groups differs wildly, with certain groups being accepted whilst others face problems integrating. 

Overall, I'd say that their should be restrictions on immigration based on the potential growth that it can bring to the country. However, having an ""open door"" policy is a one-way ticket to anger those who already live here, and allow yourself to be taken advantage of. 

Whether or not the current restrictions are good enough is almost impossible to calculate, due to the Home Office not even being sure on how many immigrants there are, and the immeasurable task of weighing up a persons cost on the society.

Let's everyone run around screaming in panic!

How about some rational explanations

The actual quote from Matt Smith about ""Looking for work""

&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm going over to Los Angeles this week to dip my head in the pond,‚Äù Matt reveals. ‚ÄúI am going to be having loads of meetings with film people and that sort of stuff.

‚ÄúI have a lot of ambitions. I would like one day to direct and I just want to keep doing quality work. LA is kinda groovy ‚Äì I really like it out there.‚Äù

Yeah, that very much screams that he's not coming back next year doesn't it? I mean it couldn't possibly mean that he's making contact with various studio heads to line up projects for when he's done with Doctor Who could it? No, why think that? 

Karen and Arthur are auditioning for new roles!! Well we knew that (or strongly suspected that) since the beginning of this season. What the article fails to mention is that James Cordon is supposed to be in episode 12 of this series, i.e. just in time to be the new companion.


On to the rest of their ""evidence""

&gt;Show being split due to budget

This makes absolutely no sense. How does splitting a show in the middle of the year actually save money? The far more likely explanation for splitting the show is to reduce fan waiting time from the end of Series 6 to the beginning of Series 7 and to focus on promoting Torchwood: Miracle Day which just happens to be running during the break between the two. 

&gt;Poor scheduling

See above answer

&gt;Second set of shows not available for Christmas DVD release

Why does this impact the start of Series 7? It just gives the BBC another chance to ask for more money from it's fans. It doesn't indicate that there will be a delay in the next series. 

&gt;Former producers refused to return to the show after being dismissed.

Well there's a shocker. Someone is fired and then asked back and they don't want to come back? 

Basically it's a bunch of scraped together rumors, twisted 180 degrees, folded into a pretzel and then made into a cake. 

Moffat just tweeted that Matt Smith is contracted for 14 more episodes for sure. Now it's possible that the show could be delayed a full season but why pay him to sit and do nothing. I think the more likely explanation is a Christmas episode regular 12 episode season 7 (split again), and episode 1 of Series 8, which would happen to be the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who.

Also, the point is putting a gay character in a show when it isn't even necessary for the plot or if the show doesn't even deal with issues such as this, hence my refrence to Doctor Who not being Sex In The City where SITC you would not even blink an eye if they brought in a gay character. My other point was that when they do bring in a gay character it seems like they go way out in left field to let it be known that the person is gay and pretty soon it seems like the focus is not on the show at all, but seeing how far we can take the gay, lesbian, bi issue. It just seems a little stupid. Also the reason i even started this conversation is because the link had people talking about The Doctor being Bi-sexual and  Adric and Turlough being Gay or Bi, then you have Jack Harkness whom they have made a big deal about him being gay, then Canton, the pointless pointing out that the fat guy and skinny guy from AGMGTW were gay (which had no freaking reason to be in there) and the lizard lady and her ""friend"" which was pointless as well. OK and with Doctor Who, from classic to new Who, we don't watch it because we want to see gay lovers or lesbian lovers, heck we don't even watch it because it is some great love story like i said it isn't sex in the city or any show that is like that. We know what it's about and why we watch it and i will stick by my opinion in saying that sticking gay characters in a show and over exaggerating the fact that they are gay is stupid and doesn't do anything to enhance a show like this or make gays more acceptable to culture. People need to get to know one another for who they really are inside, not what they are shown to be on TV.

That's the reality of Doctor Who sometimes, that not everybody gets to live happily ever after, not everybody in the TARDIS gets safely home after their travels are done.  That's possibly the one real complaint I have with the new series, there hasn't been a real companion death yet(you never really got a chance to get attached to Rory the first time around, and Rose just got sealed into another dimension).  A few companions have died over the years, and it was always when you saw the Doctor at his best... and at the same time, at his worst, at his most vulnerable and broken as he tried to cover it up and pushed onward again.  Running from the pain like he runs from everything else.  

And I'm saying this as a **huge** Rory fan, btw.  It's not because I want the character to die, I don't, but I think it would be good for the show to bring that element of unsafeness back onto the TARDIS.  Once you know that any companion truly can die at any time, the adventures get more thrilling again, all those threats a little more real.  I still remember my first companion death.

You could say its a akin to computer game censorship in Australia, they don't have an 18 certificate for computer games, so anything that would be classified as an 18 is effectively banned, its not really banned, because you can import it legally, but the ratings they have don't go up to the level of gore/disturbingness of a gory game, so the producers either cut out the gore, or don't release it.

Well we're kind of the same, even an 18 certificate film has upper limits, and the human centipede 2 is above those (i.e. we don't have a 'this is really fucked up, only watch it if you want to be really really shocked certificate') the human centipede 1 had parts cut out to make it fit into the 18 category, its not hugely uncommon, but the BBFC don't think that its possible in this film, as almost the entire thing is overtly disturbing.

Now of course in order to show any movie in a cinema or in public or to sell it at a normal movie outlet it has to have a certificate (otherwise kids could by it). This one doesn't so it can't be sold in the UK or shown in public.

So either the BBFC introduces a NSFL certificate, or you just have to import films like this, its not really a bad thing, it hasn't been 'banned' its just been deemed not suitable for a commercial release.",0,1307468770,null,0,false,0,c1ybpu1,t3_ht2py,t1_c1ybpu1,t1_c1ybfjw,1427221726,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

personally, i find it quite enjoyable to ""guess"" what the writer is going to do.  i did it with harry potter, discussing the possibilities for the last book with my sister for hours after we had both finished the 6th book.  i do it in nearly every movie i watch - often figuring out the upcoming ""twists"" long before they're revealed (i have been told off occasionally for talking about what i think is coming during movies &gt;_&gt; )

true,LucienReeve,null,null,"For what it's worth, my feelings towards her are pretty mixed. But what really stands out to me about her is that she seems to me to exemplify the slightly wobbly way that Moffat writes women. 

I'll try to explain, because I'm not saying that Moffat is a misogynist or writes bad female characters. There is a famous (quite old) [interview](http://living.scotsman.com/features/Time-Lad-scores-with-sex.2535185.jp) where he says, off-the-cuff, that he thinks that women are more ""needy"" than men, which seems a pretty unpleasant thing to say. I don't really want to comment on that one way or the other, though. 

What I have noticed is that he has a bit of a tendency to write female characters as *constantly commenting on their own femaleness*. There were two lesbian characters in *Jekyll*, another (pretty good) series that he wrote, who seem to be saying, almost every other line, ""my goodness! we are women! and gay! how about that!?"" He rather seemed to be recycling those characters in the Silurian and her sidekick in episode 07. 

River Song sometimes slightly irritates me for that reason. She can come across less as a person than as a self-aware character in a story, who knows that she is the femme fatale and ""bad girl"" and her dialogue can play to that in a slightly annoying way. I also think that she is often written as using dialogue that echoes stereotypically ""wifely"" phrases - e.g. ""hello sweetie"". I know that she is supposed to be doing that in an empowered, knowing, amused way - but I have always been very suspicious of men writing women as ironically aping older, sexist tropes - in this case, about shrewish wives and ""her indoors"". 

This is a difficult topic to raise, as it usually derails things into ""is Stephen Moffat sexist?"", which is not a question that any of us are well placed to resolve and which I have no interest in investigating. What I think one can say is that he likes writing about happily married life, probably because he really loves his own wife - but I also find his female characters a bit two-dimensional by comparison with his male characters (e.g. Amy is a bit 'manic pixie dream girl'), for all that they are given plenty to do. That carries over to River Song, who is probably his most powerful and independent female character.

He did piss them off quite a bit and they want to maintain their hold on humanity, which they know the Doctor will not allow.

I also think that the Silence are more than they seem. It's possible that they were the ones who convinced Eye Patch Lady et al. to start a war with the Doctor since, as you remember, they don't get their hands dirty themselves. They could be running the whole show all along, making sure that every piece to their puzzle falls into place. Many things are possible, but I highly doubt that they are good or even good-ish. They have their own motives that don't fit with the Doctor's overall goals; ""You should kill us all on sight.""

One last thought about how we could all still be wrong about the timing of Amy's abduction. In 6.7 the Doctor says it probably happened just before America, but at the end of 6.1 Amy is certain that she is pregnant, and near the beginning of 6.2 we know she is already a ganger. The three-month gap between episodes could have been used to capture Amy and make sure she doesn't remember it, making the 'they know something's amiss' theory not work.

""The Silence Will Fall"" was their way of telling the Doctor that everything was going according to plan.  The Flesh have overtaken the Earth, and the Doctor brought the Silence to Earth to keep the Flesh from knowing they are Flesh.

He brings some other alien race there to build Tardis-like devices for the Silence, because they can kidnap someone and stabilize them into humanity without anyone ever being the wiser.

Thus, ""The Silence Will Fall.""  Everything is going according to plan.  The Flesh are almost defeated, and the Doctor already knew that he would destroy the Silence and how he should learn about them in the first place.

""The Doctor in the Tardis doesn't know!""

Yes he does.  Just not yet.  He made the perfect response plan, one that no opposing race would believe.  He installed a controlling alien race on planet Earth and left them there for millenia.

Who would have ever guessed this would be his response?

Then he realizes he's genocided two species and has to stop running from who he has become... only to be saved by the Flesh Doctor, the only creature alive in the universe who can both sympathize and forgive him.  And take his place in death.

(Main reason I doubt this theory is that I don't think the sinister voice saying Silence Will Fall during the Pandorica episodes was the doctor.  I have no idea who else could or would try to take control of the Tardis, and it's a key part of the story.)

This gives the 'Scottish' fields a couple of decades of life left, if research and exploration remains profitable, a bare few at most. 

But again, putting aside that peak oil in the North Sea was reached in the 80s and 90s, let's give Scotland for argument's sake a billion or so surplus.  It still loses RBS and much of the financial district in Edinburgh.  It loses its jobs.  It loses its house prices.  Scotland is very well represented in the Armed Forces and the good news is their overseas lads will be coming home.  The bad news is they're out of a job, as are all the communities based around RAF and naval bases as the Union jets fly to the Union...but then maybe that's not a bad thing.  Savings all round both for the Union and Scotland.  Not a single Union army community need suffer though.  Scotland's would however, the Union forces and equipment would all move South.

Expect rates to get a lot more expensive though.  It won't be Centrica anymore piping gas, or the BG Group, but Scotland will have a private company to buy out and a distribution cost to accommodate over a wider much less dense population.  Same goes for roads and everything else which would have had its costs spread by a wider union.  Roads, telecoms...  Transco won't be running the Scottish Power owned grid anymore either.  So whatever price hikes Scottish Power have just announced consider the tiniest of aperitifs for what is to come.  It's a lot cheaper when you have high population densities to lower and spread the costs.  Scotland wouldn't have that anymore, because British companies have up to now been doing it.

Arguably Scotland also would be on its own in Europe and could well become a net receiver, but I wouldn't count on it if England pulls out.  They'd actually be left to pick up some of the slack.    

So hypothetically, even if we take the 1997 article and recognise the full Scottish claim to the oil field, ignoring all the changes that have happened since, a 1997 ¬£1.5billion surplus would be wiped out and spent and accounted for by day 4. There'd still be no banks, no jobs, rising costs forcing front line cuts...and the oil is running out.  What's day 5?

Doctor who is quite well off when its peers are stuff like Eureka, and Stargate, fun shows that come on once a week and then go away. 

But if you compare it to a successful non-monster of the weekish show it comes up woefully short. Its not particularly well acted, its characters dont seem that well thought out, and its plot resolution more often than not just sort of happens.

I'd rule your first example out entirely just because that line was so forced.

That's ok, because its not taking place in the context of the show. Obvious red herrings and forced comparisons between Rory and the doctor belong in this category, IMHO.

true,Atman00,null,null,"People are so obsessed over the unanswered questions and the reveal that they ignore all of the depth contained in the individual episodes.

For instance, the emotional core of A Good Man Goes to War had *nothing to do* with River Song.  (What follows is all copy/pasted from several other posts I've made, so it may be a bit disjointed.)

&gt;The emotional arc of this episode is the Doctor struggling with everyone in the cosmos viewing him as a weapon, and a warrior, and all of these things that he hates. That the word doctor means great warrior to them is incredibly hard for him.. The Doctor is realizing that he is his own ideological opposite, that his legacy is not one of healing and helping, but of war and fear and death.

&gt;Lorna came in search of the Doctor, she was the one who showed empathy to Amy, who realized what the Clerics were doing was wrong. This goodness couldn't have come from her one word encounter with the Doctor, it came from her people.

&gt;We aren't told a lot about the Gamma Forests, but what we do learn paints a great picture. Gamma Forests are neutral in the war. She calls Gamma Forest a boring place, where 30 seconds of the Doctor is the only interesting thing to ever happen. Basically, a peaceful place. Even the name conjures up a rather idyllic setting. Basically, Lorna and her people are the only grounding of peace in this episode, of ideals the Doctor strives for. Every other character, every conversation, every scene in the entire episode revolves around violence. And those are the people whose word for warrior is doctor. That's so much more effective than any reference they could make.

&gt;There was also another way this episode built the theme of the Doctor's legacy of violence, and that was through his companions. Most of the people we saw were indebted to him; This was their penance and redemption. Lorna is important because she was the companion he didn't recruit. She sought him out. The Doctor crashed on her world and said one word to her. His encounter was as fleeting as it gets. Probably a fairly boring day for the Doctor, not even worth telling to us; and from this, he inadvertently turned her into a weapon and got her killed. I can't think of a more effective way to build this theme than that.

&gt;So many people dismiss her as just a cheap plot device to introduce the prayer leaf, or they assume she must be really important later. I think she works perfectly fine as a one off, and shows the depth of Moffat's writing.

All of that is a single episode arc.  It's also a theme that's been really prevalent for the rest of Moffat's run, and will continue to be, but as presented in this episode, it's an emotionally driven, compelling, and contained story of the Doctor being crushed by his legacy.  

My roommate's first episode of Doctor Who ever was Day of the Moon, and he *loved* it.  It was fine that he didn't know all that came before, and it was fine that the loose ends weren't tied up, because the story as presented was compelling.  The important bits were mostly wrapped up, (The Silence were driven off of Earth and they rescued Amy) and what wasn't wrapped up didn't need to be in order to enjoy the rest.

People that let the unanswered questions ruin the show for them are just impatient.  Let it go, the answers will show up eventually.  The episodes he writes now are just as strong as the ones he used to write.  They still have the standard 3 acts,  they still have their own plots and resolutions.  They still work on their own.

I actually adored Tom Baker (2nd favorite Doctor), and while I can see the comparison now that you mention it, Matt Smith just doesn't cut it for me.  Can you imagine him asking someone if they want a Jelly-Baby?  Tom Baker had an excellent sense of humor about himself, and this wonderful self-effacing quality, which is an excellent trait that Matt Smith seems to lack.  I get the sense he thinks he's ""too cool"" or something like that.

Edited to add: I think what bothers me about Matt Smith's portrayal of The Doctor is that he doesn't seem to grasp the gravity of the role the way other Doctors have.  The Doctor has always been acutely aware of the importance of his role in history, and of the burden he bears because of it.  Matt Smith seems like he doesn't get that at all, and it makes his portrayal so two-dimensional.  He comes off as a bit smug and cocky, which The Doctor, as a character, never has been.  The Doctor is always the wisest of the bunch, and Matt Smith's portrayal has turned this wisdom into what appears to be a sense of superiority over others.  I don't believe The Doctor, as a character, would ever behave the way Matt Smith portrays him.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; General opposition to private education, with many of the points that are raised against that (which I'm sure you get, even if you don't agree).

I don't have a huge problem with private education as long as it's regulated and we can steal any good ideas they have for the public system. So far I've not really heard a really good argument for banning private education.

&gt; Instead of fighting for universities (that educated them) under pressure, prestigious academics look to make themselves some money.

Nothing surprising here. How many lecturers put books they've written on reading lists? But I'm not sure if this is a money grab or an attempt to try something new in education. It's already been pointed out that many of the big names already work for other universities and won't be giving these jobs up. 

&gt; If it turns out to be crap, then it's crap and shouldn't exist. If it turns out to be good then the fact that ""at $18K a year the choice to attend is moot for most people"" becomes unfair.

Life isn't fair I'm afraid. I can see why people might want this quality of education to be universal (if it turns out to be worth every penny), but I don't see why we should prevent people from offering services at cost to those who can afford them. 

&gt; Particular details of this venture, e,g. plagiarism of syllabus, lack of science, small number of teaching hours actually offered by celebrity lecturers, etc.

All decent reasons not to pay the exorbitant fee's. From what I've seen I don't think it's worth it myself.

&gt; I'm sure you could have thought of these and other reasons for ""the hate"" yourself, if you'd really racked your brain.

In the first episode set sometime in the late 22nd century, an on-board radiation leak of cadmium II kills everyone except for low-ranking technician Dave Lister, who is in suspended animation at the time, and his pregnant cat, Frankenstein, who is safely sealed in the cargo hold. Following the accident, the ship's computer Holly keeps Lister in stasis until the background radiation dies down ‚Äì a process that takes three million years. Lister therefore emerges as the last human being in the universe ‚Äì but not alone on-board the ship.

Yes, they drove carniverous fish-monsters from their homeworld because they were the ""goodish"" guys and thought that what Venice really needed was some decent blood suckers.

I appreicate that since Davies, the Doctor has been the greatest villian, doing monsterous things like ""not letting every human on earth get eaten"" and ""begging Davros to accept rescue, even though the Daleks didn't actually get to kill everyone in every universe"" and even war-crimes like ""not letting every human on earth be turned into a brain-dead zombie with a gas mask stuck to the face"".

But, despite those unforgivable atrocities committed by the greatest villian in the multiverse, I'm a little fuzzy on exactly what the Silence have done that's so admirable.

&gt; Who's side were they actually on?

The sole good thing the Silence allegedly did was get humanity to make a spacesuit for a child.

Some guys who are actually just misunderstood freedom fighters trying to resist the worst war criminal in the history of the universe happen to have gotten hold of a child with some time-lord attributes and by an amazing coincidence, a girl with some time-lord attributes was wandering around at the end of ""Day of the Moon"".

I imagine there may be some connection between the great leaders of humanity (and friends to noble vegetarian fish-monsters everywhere) and the church of freedom and beating war criminals.

Interesting theory, I'm not convinced.

&gt; He installed a controlling alien race on planet Earth and left them there for millenia.

A theory that relies on ignoring all the other planets in the universe occupied entirely by Silence.

I suppose if you assume the season-5 finale reboot of the universe undid *everything* from every previous season, then the Silence from this season are completely different to the Silence from the season that didn't happen and we might as well asssume that they're on a mission to fill the universe with unicorns.

&gt; Then he realizes he's genocided two species and has to stop running from who he has become

We're talking about a guy who consistently refused to exterminate the Daleks, and even at the end of season 4 (of the new series) begged Davros to accept a lift on the TARDIS despite his efforts to kill everything in every universe.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Henderson is at stage where a bit of performance increase will make his english caps regular. If you don't take him now, he is gone, and you will have to wait around for another player to potentially replace gerrard when he can no longer play a full season as he will be 34 in 3 years. For now, lucas and gerrard are concrete, but you need backup. Currently meireles, spearing and jonjo are doing the job. I can see either jonjo or spearing being loaned out to get a full season, as it will be hard to force gerrard on bench. Whereas Adam would have no problem with this due to him having already developed. Henderson comes in because he is already developed version of Spearing and Jonjo that will be useful and at the same time cement his place in the first team. Henderson has had a full season of PL, neither jonjo nor spearing are close to that.

Just look at what happened to Wilshere when he got back from his loan spell. That IMO is the difference between getting 3-5 games and full season. Spearings performance is PL IMO and should have the ability to force starting position for over half the teams in PL. Jonjo on the other hand I think we will most likely keep him around for more experience with the first team and develop him the way we want, before allowing him to gain season long experience with another team.

So for 2 positions in the midfield for potentially 60 matches, you will have Lucas, Gerrard, Meireles, Adam, Henderson and Jonjo. If Lucas and Gerrard start 35-40 matches (very optimistic as this mean in form for the most part of the season and no injuries) with subs and possible injuries cutting it down to 30-35, we can easily field these players.

On top of that, who says we can't play with more than 2 CM? Henderson is also RM player if needed for those matches and I can easily see us shifting the squad to maximize the fitness when some matches are close to one another.

If LFC is going to win PL, we can't have the famous arsenal exhaustion at second half, nor a bad start. If a player is playing bad, we need to play those in form. If we are going to field second team, that team better be better than the teams we are facing.

The shriller and shriller criticisms of her from DC and much of the print media (and too a lesser extent the tv), and the kind of Democrats who have been in a tiz about this Wiener guy. particularly, the personal shit absolutely makes your bog standard flag saluting American a bit pissed-off.

Yeah you can be pissed off at her 'pro-life' stance but there are many, many democrats who believe in that also so it is a non-starter as a criticism in US politics. Half of the more extreme criticisms ('I can see Russia from my house', making rape victims pay for rape examinations, one of her kids is actually her daughter's etc etc) are simply untrue (to say nothing of the degree of misogyny) and really I can see that kind of crap garnering her sympathy.

Now, a rational person who hears a claim like that will at least consider the possibility that I am just a nut.

Merely claiming to have enslaved you doesn't mean I have actually enslaved you.  To have actually enslaved you, I have to be making you do things that are not in your best interest, and removing your ability to do otherwise.  To illustrate, somebody working a McJob for minimum wage is not enslaved, because they can walk away.  Compare that to a [coal miner in 1910](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westmoreland_County_Coal_Strike_of_1910%E2%80%931911) who has some real grief.  Those companies enslaved people, ruined lives for the bottom line, and used violence to maintain order, and we still don't sentence them to death.  What crimes have the Silence committed during their enslavement of humanity?

&gt;What did they want the doctor to do about it? Why warn him? Who's side were they actually on? Is it that they were actually the good(ish) guys all along?

Gnovos wasn't trying to cast the Doctor as the villain;  he was suggesting that we might not understand the Silence.  I think that's actually a pretty solid assumption to make, given it is their nature to be unknowable.

You decided to suggest a false dichotomy, that either the Silence or the Doctor must be monsters.  Based on that, Gnovos' doubts about the Silence become an attack on the Doctor.  However, I'm sure you will agree that it is not an either-or proposition; the morality of the Silence doesn't change the morality of the Doctor.

By using that false dichotomy, you are trying to make Gnovos look foolish.  You took this false premise (that Gnovos thinks the Doctor is evil) and extended it into a sarcastic parody of his supposed position, where Gnovos is a weeping monster sympathizer who hates the Doctor. This attack, remember, is based on the logical fallacy we talked about above;  it is, in other words, a lie.

true,LincolnshireSausage,k9,K-9,I have to ask out of curiosity and to better understand why people downvote. I have RES installed and I can see that my comment has one downvote at this time. Many of my comments have downvotes but I'm picking on this one because it's recent and because anything is possible in the world of Doctor Who. My question is why did my comment get a downvote? Is it because whoever downvoted it does not agree with my speculations? If that is the case then why not post a reply offering a different opinion? Isn't Reddit supposed to be a discussion where everyone offers up their point of view from which we can all draw our own conclusions? Just because someone doesn't agree with a comment does not mean that it is not worthy of being part of the discussion; discussions often involve two opposing points of view. I thought the downvote button was for the posts with horribly erroneous information in them. An example of that would be if I claimed cigarettes can cure cancer. That would deserve to be downvoted into oblivion so Redditors do not get terrible advice when they want the truth. This is another reason I picked on this particular comment of mine because as I mentioned when we are speculating on what could happen almost anything could be the truth in the world of Doctor Who. I made valid arguments based upon what happened in the shows and if you don't agree with them I would like to know why rather than just receiving a random downvote for no apparent reason. So the next time you want to hit the downvote button why don't you actually be a part of Reddit and post a reply explaining why you downvoted? How am I ever supposed to understand what is disagreeable about my comment unless you tell me?,0,1307517837,null,0,false,0,c1ygo8u,t3_htucu,t1_c1ygo8u,t1_c1yg1yz,1427224129,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

As more and more people vote, the rating of episodes should approach the general consensus. My votes will remain public, but yours will be private.

To vote, here are the steps:

1 ) Register at the above link. Read the text above. **I don't need your e-mail**, just leave the field blank unless you are scared of forgetting your password: I won't be able to retrieve it, since it's encodes in SHA1.

2 ) Once you click submit with a username and a password entered, the list of all of the Doctor Who episodes will show up, with a drop down from 0 to 7, defaulting on - (no vote).

3 ) Vote on as many or as little episodes as you want and click save at the bottom.

4 ) Once the page refreshes, your vote is recorded and the new rating for the episodes you voted for are calculated. Right now, the rating is my vote, but as users vote, it should change.

5 ) You can see the average rating for each season, the average of your own votes and the average of my own votes. Only episodes which are rated are counted in the average.

6 ) You can change your vote ANYTIME but at this moment, it is not possible to go from a vote back to no vote. I can do it if there is sufficient request, but I fail to see why it would be needed.

7 ) Once you voted and seen it works, come share here! Tell me if you saw a bug or if you have an idea to improve it.",0,1307519417,null,0,false,0,c1ygraj,t3_hugim,t1_c1ygraj,t3_hugim,1427224170,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

And **especially** not with how popular the series currently is)

Relax dude.  That deus ex machina is coming, and I'm thinking it's probably going to be brilliant and awesome with the way things have been picking up this series.  

Hell, Moffat himself must realize that if he fucking kills Doctor Who he's going to have to move away from any country where the show has ever been aired...  Because otherwise the fans **will** find him and they **will** exact revenge.

Right now the show is popular again, and it'll keep running as long as people keep watching...  Then, some day, people will stop watching, and it'll get cancelled again...  But I expect even if it does, it'll end with the Doctor(whoever he or she may be by then) leaving the scene of his latest triumph in Sexy....

When the Tories announced they were keeping the NHS budget the same, they severely underestimated the extent to which NHS trusts around the country were indebted to PFI contracts. In my eyes, Private Finance Initiatives are awful, and pretty much the main reason I wanted Labour out of power.

PFI is used if a government wants to get extra revenue on top of taxes and borrowing money. They basically get private businesses to pay for a project (as opposed to paying for it with taxpayer money, or borrowed money) and then either allow that private business to have free use of part of the final product, or the government leases whatever was funded so that the private business gets its money back, or the government just agrees to pay the business back at some point.

The trouble is that it tends to end up costing more than just borrowing money, but because it doesn't show up on statute books, it looks like the money that the government owes to people is lower than it in fact is.

Generally, NHS PFI contracts are worse than most. For example, a new hospital being built in London was partially funded by a PFI contract that contributed ¬£256million to the project. By 2015, the government (and hence, the taxpayer) will have paid ¬£1.5billion in return for the original investment.",0,1307525094,null,0,false,0,c1yh07h,t3_huh2s,t1_c1yh07h,t3_huh2s,1427224296,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Anyway, what I mean is that the clearest sign that Eleven was in danger of succumbing to his dark side was in the ritual humiliation of 'Colonel Runaway'.  While not entirely undeserved given the actions of the Eyepatch Gang, this was driven by fury and vengance, and was a sign that the Doc was being led by his negative emotions instead of being the 'good' man.

It sounds as if the idea of the PFI was good: you involve small, local businesses in Government projects that would allow them to have benefit as well as the Government.  However they would be curtailed by the Government agency/department who gave out the PFIs to their mates or large Government agencies (I'm looking at you Capita, Serco et al).  They give it to the organisation that can give them the best deal (or pitch it to make it seem like the best deal), negating the point of the system in the first place.

Only in the most basic sense. If you can't provide for a child, then isn't it immoral to bring one into the world? 

If someone decides to have a child then that's their business. If someone decides to buy a car, then that's also their business. But you wouldn't buy a car with no foresight as to how you're going to afford to put fuel in it, and you certainly wouldn't expect the government to provide you with a garage in which to keep it.

Most rational people will wait until they have the means before they choose to engage in the decidedly selfish act of procreation, but unfortunately others dive right in.

&gt;There is no moral relationship between fostering children and giving birth.

Why are you bringing morality into this? If you're going to do that then there's an obvious relationship between fostering and giving birth - in both cases the welfare of a child is at stake, and society has decided that it has a moral responsibility for the welfare of all children.

Where is the difference, from the point of view of a child's welfare, between adoption and procreation?

The first episode of the next story aired the very next week after the last episode of the previous story. And each of those 25 minute episodes? yeah you'd have to wait a week between each. There were, like now, breaks for a few months between seasons. So, yeah, huge difference from it being ""specials"" that only aired once every few months.

No-one suggested that a uniform was about cost. We're just weighing up the difference between using clothes you already own over clothes for a specific purpose.

With no uniform, the clothes you buy can cost however much you like. Buying specific clothes may be a more expensive option, than using the clothes they already own.

Kids find their own groups as they try to find/create their own identity within their school years, and the uniform does nothing for it. How can you be an individual and express yourself if you are forced to follow a particular path? 

I realise that it's only clothes but it they can be a major part of your identity, and I believe that forcing them to take up an identity that they might not care for is a waste of time. Speaking from my own experience, I didn't give a shit about my school and neither did most people, not because it was a poor school, but because simply because it meant nothing to us as an establishment.

If the kids want to have that identity, then they can get those college/university style jumpers with the name on it. At least then they will still have something to use for goal posts.

&gt;And I certainly wouldn't say uniforms are a thing of the past

A majority of schools using them doesn't necessarily mean it's right. Uniforms have been around for so long, they are automatically assumed to be part of school life.

But going back to the original discussion (which we've veered off a little), can a school really place that sense of identity over the education of the children who attend?

The reason for the downvote was because my initial comment was downvoted. It was a childish retaliation, though you might not have been the person to downvote me in the first place. 

As for the ""Go fuck yourself"" thought, I honestly see the potential for the specials to be similar to how the show was run during the classic series, though with full stories in what averaged out to about 4-part serials. That said, my ""Go fuck yourself"" was over what I considered at the time to have been a comment over semantics.

Obviously we've gotten off on the wrong foot. 

Although I already was aware of the range in duration of the serials, I simply stated 4 episodes for expedience. Clearly we're past expedience in our communication, however.

My initial point was that I would not be opposed to, for example, 12 total episodes in 2012 wherein the episodes came out in 4-part bursts of complete storylines. I additionally would have liked it even more if those 4-part bursts came out quarterly, though that is something that has never happened before. 

My idea for quarterly releases would be beneficial for keeping the fans excited about the show without a long hiatus, which seems like it might be what we get instead. I simply like the idea of having the show come out in January for approximately 4 weeks, then April for approximately 4 weeks, then July, the October, with a one-off Christmas special in December.

I thought it was, as you stated:

&gt;but shirts, trousers, shoes, blazer or jumper etc must add up to fair bit alone.

Implying that uniforms cost money. But I think it's fair to say that whatever you wear to school, it's going to cost something!

I appreciate that children will and do segregate into their own groups, part of growing up is about discovering and expressing yourself as an individual as you point out.

Our society however is, by and large, about conformity. We have a government to facilitate over various areas, which make laws that apply universally and which all must obey. When we join the work environment we might have a uniform (I accept not all jobs require uniforms, but most do have some form of dress code) that we are required to wear in order to retain our employment, and are expected to follow the requests of our superiors.

I agree uniforms don't always work, but the underlying idea and values they teach are relevant I feel in preparing children for the required conformity they will have to adapt to when older.

I see your point about children not valueing the establishment of education, I knew many fellow pupils who felt similarly when I was at school. I think that's a problem more with the pressure placed on schools to simply teach kids the basics and churn them out as often as possible. They lack the funds and motivation needed to instill a sense of pride and belonging with which the uniform would act in conjunction with. Alas, simply a sign of the times I suppose.

In this particular instance, I would have made the children remove their shoes and then let them take the exam. If they called my bluff and refused, I'd probably still let them take the exam. I think it's interesting to note that had they been allowed to take the exam, their education would have (hopefully) benefitted, but what lesson would it have taught them about authority? Be stubborn enough for long enough and you get your own way? Tis a bit of a conundrum.

Yeah, I think we just got a little crossed there, sorry if I didn't explain it as well as I thought. I was just saying that the school that decides to have a uniform don't use cost as a reason for having (or not having) a uniform, but parents do have to factor it into their budgets.

As we've said, a school uniform is about trying to create a sense of uniformity, pride and togetherness. Although authority figures at school wear shirt and tie affairs. There is nothing to tie (no pun intended) them into that same feeling of unity at a school.

A work uniform is all about identity and professionalism, so that there is a clear understanding and a message is conveyed to those who aren't part of your company of your connection to the work place. I don't believe that a child who has not worn a school uniform before would be at any disadvantage to one who had if the time comes to wear a work uniform. 

It's only companies that deal with customers/public face-to-face that are require staff to wear a particular uniform including managers who work shop floor, even though they are the stores authority figure (unless it is required for a reason like high visibility jackets). Other than that, they use guidelines to maintain a manner of professionalism within the work place. 

&gt;In this particular instance, I would have made the children remove their shoes and then let them take the exam. If they called my bluff and refused, I'd probably still let them take the exam. 

I'd have done the exact same. Of course rules need to be followed but you need to decide whether the rule is more important than the exam.
Let them do it either way, but make it extremely clear to them and their parents that any similar infringement would be costly. That way, there can be no argument later on.",0,1307544232,null,0,false,0,c1yi3wd,t3_huh00,t1_c1yi3wd,t1_c1yhwad,1427224805,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

But, you know.. I like it now. A classic Who story is normally 4 episodes. Sometimes 6, sometimes 2 or 10 or 12. I suppose it is a bit more expensive compared to other shows, but consider this:

- All the episodes are restored to great quality by the Doctor Who Restoration Team (which I think grew from a pure fan-based operation to the primary force in archiving and publishing classic Who).

- Hilarious and insightful commentary tracks featuring everyone from the late Verity Lambert to Tom Baker.

- Documentaries, clips from contemporary shows, PDF files of contemporary comics and DW Annuals.

And all of that for every story. IMO, it's probably one of the best efforts in bringing an old TV show to DVD. 

I personally started by buying sets of 7/8 stories, often 1 of each Doctor. Such a set is about the price of a regular TV DVD box, I reckon.

One thing to notice is that they are very close to completion, ie releasing all available classic Who on DVD. I think somewhere in late 2012 or early 2013 they'll be done.

I tried to start with the first episode of the first doctor i.e. literally the first episode.  I'm too OCD to start a show in the middle even if its more episodic instead of a running story. I have to find an intuitive starting point (like the series resurrection in 2005).  However I'm not so OCD that I can't make an exception.  Having floated around the communities I've found, Baker does seem to be a good starting point.
  
As for what's bothering me, I haven't quite pinpointed it.  I'm sure that some of it is production values/capabilities of the time period.  I'm too used to current stuff since I'm only in my early 20's.  Perhaps now I'm hooked enough to give it a better chance...

Yes, like any oil producer there is an article about this every six months, always followed by another one [stating the opposite](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/8530228.stm) six months after that. Linked one points to 60% increased estimated yields. 

To be honest the oil industry cannot ever be trusted on figures either way, they always have an angle to push when they publish. Particularly OPEC, their quota system practically guarantees lies. 


&gt; the second time I've seen a Scottish person on Reddit claim that England were the sole reason we went to war

They were. The only Scottish MPs that voted ""yay"" were those that did so on the order of the party leadership (as it also is with the West-Lothian issue). I actually spoke with them about this during the election a few years back, some of the lackies were pretty angry about it. Scotland was far more against the war than England. The SNP, the party with the current mandate, was very vocally against it. 

PS Tony Blair is about as Scottish as Morris Dancing. And Brown was the chancellor, he had little influence in this matter.

But don't get me wrong, I love the show. I think Moffatt makes *great* individual shows. But the series as a whole, I don't know. I can't say I like his character development or the way the arcs go. I don't feel any closeness to Rory or Amy, at least not in the way I did with Tennant's companions. Last seasons finale was a HUGE letdown for me, and I can't say I'm very pleased with who River is either. 

Maybe I'm spoiled because I come in here with you chaps and hear fantastic theories that you people have thought over everyday for a year straight, but I dunno. Rory just doesn't do anything for me. I wanted to laugh out loud at his attempt of bad assery this last episode, but held my breath out of respect of others in the room. In theory, sure, Rory waiting for 2000 years is amazing. It's romantic and shows great strength. But I didn't feel like he did it, probably because they glossed over it to quickly. 

And isn't that what a story is really about? Not the act of telling the story, but showing the story instead. It's the same reason why none of us takes Rory's death seriously anymore. It just happens too comically, too quickly, and too often, and I wouldn't be surprised at the end if he actually does die, and we're all so desensitized to it that it takes a few days or weeks to process.

This might actually be an explanation for why the Doctor has gotten younger and younger - the first regeneration ages to a very old age, and each regeneration rebuilds the body more fit than it was before it regenerated (more often than not, although not always, yielding a younger looking body).",0,1307566368,null,0,false,0,c1ykmby,t3_hunbb,t1_c1ykmby,t1_c1ykkw2,1427225988,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I saw Germany make a decision based on political reasons that will leave them in a very dangerous position unless they have a plan. 

Those are lots of very interesting links but the majority of them are the same old talk that Greenpeace and others keep give. Let's use more wind, solar and tidal energy. Except they don't provide nearly enough power for an effective cost, if we had unlimited funds and space I'm sure we could but as it is we are lots of people on a small island with money problems. Nuclear is a safe, proven and more cost effective way of providing an independant energy source. Note I said independant as many of those proposals suggest huge solar farms in North Africa. Now call me crazy but aren't we having a touch of trouble with a rather large country in North Africa and there is no way I would risk investing huge amounts of money in such an unstable area.

If you want to see an angry time lord, watch ""Family of Blood"" again. Getting someone stuck with a stupid nickname - after they kidnap someone just to steal her daughter - is pretty mild by comparison.

&gt; I don't see what 11 has done that's all that vicious or evil.

The Atraxi threaned to murder billions of people just to get one prisoner, the Doctor gave them a scolding and told them not to do it again.

He tried to negotiate peace with the Silurians, but a *human* couldn't keep her hands off the damned trigger - so he suggested they have along nap before trying again.

I suppose he wasn't a big fan of the Daleks - and there's only so many times he can offer to help them before he gets to say ""fuck it, maybe I should have committed genocide back on Skaro after all, then at least people could stop bitching about me being the oncoming storm.""

His biggest failure was being prepared to lobotomise a space whale - and he considered that to be such a failing that he couldn't be called ""Doctor"" any more if he did it.

People are bitching non-stop about how the doctor scares his enemies - but the moment they're threatened they want someone to scare their enemies and are more than happy for the Doctor to look after them.

&gt; That's pretty mild compared to say, Waters of Mars.

There comes a point where ""assuming that you can save people even though the laws of time and physics say no"" as your worst crime is actually not all that bad.

Seriously, what was his crime there? He tried to save people even though the history books said they had to die?

Hell, the fires of pompeii was even worse - it weasn't ""they had to die in a volcanic eruption"" but, rather, they had to die, but the Doctor had to choose whether it was one city or the entire species.

To answer your question honestly. Most of the renegade Time Lords were very evil (the Master, Omega, the Rani) or very old (K'ampo/Cho Je, Chronotis, Edgeworth). The other Time Lords didn't ""travel around"" as you put it. Only the Doctor does that. Renegades were very rare and most of them were *very* old when they left (usually without a TARDIS) and the rest were evil so the Doctor probably doesn't want to visit them, if it's possible at all since an effect of the timelock could be to make interaction with the previous timelines of those locked in it to be impossible or very improbable (and if the Master was a soldier in the Time War, then I bet even the few other renegades were as well) Time travel to Gallifrey's past is impossible due to the transduction barrier which may not be there ""now"" but is still there in the ""past"", so you can't go there in a TARDIS.

We live in a country in which people can do whatever they want with their organs and bodies. Yes, objectively it's true that it's a waste, people who could have saved their loved ones etc. but frankly, I would rather not live in a country that takes my body by force, where the government owns my bones; it has been shown time and time again in debates on this matter that it would likely lead to all sorts of abuse. My body is my own, it's the only thing that doesn't belong to a corporation, a government... While I am signed up, the people who do not wish to be aren't all doing it for religious reasons. 

I'm a vegetarian and your approach reminds me of those of 'us' who go around screaming 'MEAT IS MURDER!', really not the right way to convert people...

I think if your days were numbered you'd feel differently about the 'I would refuse to receive a donation'. Also, think about your mother, your girlfriend/boyfriend whoever it is that means the world to you, think about them needing an organ, their days being put into question because another person like you somewhere felt 'queasy' about it. 

Do you even know what your liver looks like? Your heart? Unless you've had some serious health problem, chances are you've never seen them; you assume they're there because people tell you so and that's it, they bare no bigger importance in your everyday relationships, in your personality, in who you are as a person. So let me tell you they'll make even less of a difference when you're dead ;) I'm sure you're a wonderful person so don't reduce yourself to a bag of cells, which is in a way what you do when you place so much importance on the value of your organs once you won't need them anymore-it's trivial. If something happens to you, it's the memories you leave behind that count, that make you live on, not the flesh you take to the grave.

Lastly, I'd say donating is making the absolute BEST of the absolute, worst situation. Isn't it amazing that we can now turn something so tragic into something so positive? That saying 'death is always in vain'? Being able to save someone's life is a pretty good way to make it not so.

Early news reports, before the episode was broadcast, suggested he would say there is no limit to the number of regenerations. Writer Russell T Davies explained in an interview with SFX that the line was not intended to be taken seriously and is instead a commentary. He insisted that the ""thirteen lives"" rule was too deeply entrenched in the viewer consciousness for his throwaway line to affect it

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"An FMJ (full metal jacket) round is far more likely to over penetrate and exit the target intact. Which if your shooting at someone in a crowded chaotic environment is more likely to kill or wound people some distance behind your target even if they are behind light cover (like plasterboard walls or a train seat). It's even worse if you happen to miss your target.

An JHP (jacketed hollow point) round is designed to deform on impact in such a way that pretty much all the energy is dumped into the target as friction slows it down. This will produce more soft tissue cavitation, resulting in a more serious wound to the person you are actually shooting at (which is likely to kill the target faster). There is a chance that the round could fragment inside the body and that some of those fragments could exit, but they would have far less energy and mass than the original round meaning any wounds a non-combatant got would be unlikely to be life threatening. JHP rounds are also far less likely to ricochet that FMJ's, which is good for the situations the police firearms teams are likely to be deployed in.

For people who don't know much about guns JHP rounds sound terrible, but you have to remember that if a firearms officer is shooting at you they are not trying to wound you, they are trying to kill you. JHP's are ""safer"" for the police to use in the environments they are likely to use guns. It's also worth noting that for the most part the British police use MP5 variants chambered in 9mm, and are limited to semi-automatic fire, so it's not even close to a machine gun (think M240B's, M2's etc). But it still has an effective range of around 100m, which is another reason why moving to JHPs is a good idea.

Now if having armed police on the tube is a good idea or not is another question entirely, but if we do have to have them, I would far rather they had JHP's loaded than FMJ's.

Not to remove content but shift focus to good scientific thinking and less so exam passing technique (I do realise that exams do need to be passed but that should come as a result of ability not selective learning etc.)

And tbh, I can't see the UK and China going to war without the US getting involved, and they have 11 super-carrier fleets in service with another 3 being built.

true,mijj,null,null,"Watching the old Dr Who and expecting realistic special effects and sets and high production quality is like watching South Park with an expectation of Disney style animation.

i first watched Dr Who when i was 9 yrs old in 1963 - the very first episode of Dr Who.  There was no context for Dr Who, it was fresh territory.  The intro music was unbelievably stunning and set the mood for the program.

The first Doctor was always THE doctor.  I watched fairly regularly till Hartnell was switched for the second Doc.  I wasn't so pleased with the second doc.  The first one was the real deal.  The second one had his character's edges smoothed.  I watched a few of those every now and then.  Some were ok, but the essential character was gone.  It was like going from punk to pop.

And then there was the third one. Pertwee. That was the turning point. When i checked this version of Dr Who I happened to see one where he has a yellow joke car with ""who"" on the number plate. 

The next time i checked, there was a new doc, and he was talking to a toy robot dog!!

jeez!!

but .. i always loved that music.

recently i had the bright idea of checking YouTube for the music.  And that brought up some clips of the first episode.

I wondered if the first doc had edge and the later ones became more like cartoons because i was 9 yrs old and grew up.  So, hey! - it occurred to me there will be torrents!

So, i dloaded the first doc's seasons - and watched em.  The first doc was as sharp as i thought.  I dloaded all the seasons for the second doc. Some were hard going.  His character didn't have the edge of the first doc. But they were better than i remember.

Then i dloaded the 3rd doc seasons - They (generally) weren't as bad as i thought.  There were negatives, of course. The worst being the yellow clown car and the pretend karate.

then comes the 4th doc.  This was pretty good.  (Until the Leela partner left)

The 5th doc is a decline.  6th doc was bad .. 7th doc = total collapse with a dead cat bounce at the end.  If they hadn't pulled the plug when they did, the next incarnation of the doc would have been Timmy Mallet in Teletubbyland.

*anyway*

so - that's after going through all those Dr Who's after an absence of ... !! 40 years ??!!

I checked out opinions of what i saw - and i saw a lot of bollox talk about the crap sets and effects for Dr Who.  But that all misses the point.

Lets compare it to Star Trek.  Star Trek is an attempt to attract the viewer with dignified and well produced sci-fi.  Dr Who is sci-fi equivalent of porn.

Reprise: Watching the old Dr Who and expecting realistic special effects and sets and high production quality is like watching South Park and expecting Disney style animation.

You don't watch South Park for the animation quality.  You don't watch the orig Dr Who for the production and special effects quality.

The problem with haveing decent special effects is: that becomes the focus.  If the special effects are good, it takes the weight off the plot.  The plot becomes a device to connect together a series of special effects.

.. so .. anyway .. i guess i've indulged in completely random muttering - my point is .. the old Dr Who is a different animal to what you might expect.  It's South Park, not Disney.  If you have Disney expectations when checking old Doc, then you'll be badly disappointed.",0,1307594659,null,0,false,0,c1yndo7,t3_huong,t1_c1yndo7,t3_huong,1427227360,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Lets say John (fake name) creates a device that allows humanity to spread out among the stars. People start using it, and for 50yrs humanity spreads. After 50yrs these cracks appear. John travels somewhere right next to one and is immediately erased from existance. John is too major a player in the universe to simply have had no effect. There are now literally millions of people throughout the universe that know his name, and only exist due to him having created the device (They wouldn't have been born on an overpopulated earth).  
  
The erasure begins, but theres millions of other beings that are reliant on his existence to continue to exist. The universe begins patching itself up best it can, no one can remember John any more, but his creation exists.

true,dunkelzahn,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I understand that she's of human parentage.  I understand that the Doctor isn't daddy.  That would be a wee bit gross.  What I'm thinking is that she is in fact a Time Lord now, of a different type than the Doctor and the late population of Gallifrey.  One of human origin, and a living example of the potential that exists in humanity that the Doctor is drawn to.  I read somewhere that the Seventh Doctor played around with the idea of training Ace to become a Time Lord, so the Doctor's pursued the idea before...

What I read today was that the Doctor (or Time Lords in general) don't have their second heart until they regenerate, and age at a similar speed to humans in their first incarnation.  That's what prompted me to ask this question about the adult-age River Song.

The general theory I have cooking in my mind is that Gallifrey produced Time Lords due to the presence of an anomaly on their world (the Untempered Schism) that exposed the Gallifreyan race over a long period of time to the effects of the Time Vortex.  This turned many of the Gallifreyans into time-sensitive individuals who would eventually become the Time Lords when Rassilon and his contemporaries were putting together the first TARDISes and experimenting with growth of time-sensitive life forms.

With River Song, she was conceived in the middle of the rushing energies of the Time Vortex while the TARDIS was in motion, imprinting on her DNA the very same characteristics that make a Gallifreyan a time-sensitive.  Beyond that, becoming an actual Time Lord would take training, and judging from River's TARDIS piloting skills, she's got that down. Upon the first regeneration, perhaps she could have two hearts as Gallifreyan time-sensitives.  This would explain her unnatural strength as a child.

true,mijj,null,null,"&gt; you can have excellent special effects and still have an excellent story.

good point.  Right now i'm dloading the *new* (relatively) Dr Who.  Eccleston.  I've seen the first three.  Yes .. they've got a balance.  But, while we're on the subject, cramming a story into one episode really crushes out a lot of depth. It all just rushes past.  I like to soak up the atmosphere over a few episodes, rather than have it all go past me all at once.

Anyhoo  .. re quality: i think another parallel is in order.

The old Dr Who is like a live concert.  Polished production and good quality special effects stuff  is like a studio album.

So .. the old Dr Who is like seeing a recorded play - it has that live sense to it.  I think of the special effects as being *hints* for the imagination rather than attempts to be explicit reality.  I think, it's a matter of reorienting one's head.  Those old Dr Who effects weren't realistic, they were surrealistic.  Now i think of it: i think the modern trend of tv is to produce stuff where the viewer expect what he sees to be like seeing a movie.  But for the old stuff, it was like being in a theatre watching a play.  (A stunning play i saw was Equus.  Compared to the movie, the reality-discriminating person would say the sets were attrocious - practically non-existent, whereas the movie filmed reality.  But the effectiveness of the play was profound.  The movie was drab.)

I remember one episode where there's a concorde on the surface of the prehistoric earth.  It had a surreal effect.  But i read opinions that the effect was crap because it wasn't realistic.  On examination, it looked like the effect was produced by sticking an image of the plane on a background (terry gilliam style).  And that (to me, anyway) produced the surrealistic effect (because i was soaking it up, rather than examining the quality).  If it was done realisticly, it wouldn't have been surrealistic and (to me) wouldn't have been as effective.

- oh! .. i've thought of a way to psych oneself round the ""alien is a man in a rubber suit"" syndrome. (Thanks to a cue from an Eccleston Dr Who)

You know how, no matter where in the universe the Doc goes, everyone speaks english.  (We don't complain about that, tho we may occasionally wonder) And the doc explains this as the Tardis modifying minds to perceive the alien language in understandable terms ..

well .. anyway .. this could extend to the perception of form too.

The parallel is the tardis modifies minds so: everyone in the universe appears to speak english (but with a funny sound effect) : everyone in the universe appears humanoid (but looks like wearing a rubber suit).

ie. the Tardis also enters the mind so it perceives alien forms in familiar terms .. we see aliens as humans in rubber suits.  8-)",0,1307599135,null,0,true,0,c1ynqj5,t3_huong,t1_c1ynqj5,t1_c1ynfqq,1427227530,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Not sure how you can say that from the wiki article:

&gt;There are two main systems for voluntary systems: ""opt in"" (anyone who has not given consent is not a donor) and ""opt out"" (anyone who has not refused is a donor). In some systems, family members may be required to give consent or refusal, or may veto a potential recovery even if the donor has consented. Opt-out legislative systems dramatically increase effective rates of consent for donation[2]. However, because of cultural and infrastructural factors, public policies and other factors, this does not translate directly into increased rates of donation.
&gt;
&gt;Some countries with an opt-out system like Spain (34 donors per million inhabitants) or Austria (21 donors/million) have high donor rates and some countries with opt-in systems like Germany (16 donors/million) or Greece (six donors/million) have lower rates. However Sweden, which has an opt-out system, has a low rate as well (15 donors/million). The president of the Spanish National Transplant Organisation, has acknowledged Spain's legislative approach is likely not the primary reason for the country's success in increasing the donor rates, starting in the 1990s.[3]

Doubtless some of the arguments put forward in there will annoy the highly rational redditors but I think they are perfectly reasonable and I certainly would not care to have an opt-out system and religion has naff all to do with it.

Take for example the issue of child donations - surely at the death of a child simply pushing the parents away and harvesting the organs would be a shocking thing? Far better to have the parents actively involved in the decision, and the parents would have some small part of their grief assuaged at the thought that the loss of their child is helping someone else.

The NHS document is an interesting read - it addresses other social norms also such as the idea that in the UK it is not the norm to demand choices (such as compulsory voting) and we have the right to not make choices.

But the project as a whole will probably not be canceled as it has reached the flight testing stage already and despite cost overruns. 

TBH, it would have been cheaper to just provide USAF with F22's and build the F35B variant alone for naval and marine customers.

I also said that I didn't think most of River's criticisms were justified at all, especially given *her* way of dealing with bad guys fully is the way of the warrior - that's just outright hyprocrisy on her part.

However, I do think that the show was trying to make a case that the Doctor was/is in danger of falling, of becoming so much less than he is capable of, due partly to the vengeful way he acted over Colonel Runaway, and also to him generally becoming more violent and unforgiving in his retribution. 

I think it was more of a ""once you follow the dark side, forever will it consume your destiny"" warning of what he could become, rather than an actual telling-off for the things he had done.

true,lensassaman,null,null,"You're on the same track I am. I've been thinking, given Moffat's tendency to inject hard sci-fi concepts into this show, that he's probably playing with the idea of quantum immortality here. (Go and look up the quantum suicide thought experiment if you aren't familiar with it.) This works fine as long as you remain somewhat solipsistic, but as soon as you have two people whose timelines are disjointed, things start to fall apart. Rory, obviously, simply cannot die no matter how many times he's killed, so long as he needs to be alive to father River, since The Doctor wouldn't be where he is today if River didn't live until her death. Likewise, the universe *had* to reboot; the baby had to be stolen.

""Two parts of space and time that never should have touched,"" is the Doctor's comment upon seeing the crack in Amelia's wall for the first time. Rewatching that scene, I wonder if it's not a reference to River and The Doctor's timelines. Their meeting in the Library is becoming more and more implausible, yet it must be this way.

(For a really good serious hard-scifi look at quantum immortality, check out the Greg Egan book Permutation City. 

I've been thinking about it a lot this and last season of Doctor Who; rewatching Trial of a Timelord, I wonder if the world of Doctor Who was a collective dream of the Timelords, with The Matrix ensuring consistency. The Matrix is gone now, of course; locked away with the rest of The Last Great Time War; the last contributors to The Matrix are The Doctor and his TARDIS. So, they still need to balance the sums, but don't have the collective power or experience of the Time Lords to pull it off.

There's a line in Vampires of Venice that jumped out at me, too. ""Dream of us."" Originally I took it to simply mean ""remember us"", but perhaps it's more than that. Amy's Choice, too: the conclusion was that the Dream Lord was offering a choice between two dreams; perhaps it was really a choice between two realities, with The Doctor simply picking a third choice.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Duh. The reason Moffatt is revisiting that theme is to twist it. The companions are not *in* danger, they *are* the danger.  The Doctor *knows* this. He should have run away from Amy on day one and he knows it. But what happens to a trap that doesn't work? It gets destroyed. A trap in the form of a scared litttle girl who will be destroyed if he doesn't walk into it. Pure Doctor bait and now that he's *in* the trap which began the day he met Amy and ends with his final death.  So yeah, like Batman if Robin's whole existence was engineered by the Joker to force Batman to destroy himself from day one. Not sure that one's been done before.  We're not talking evil clones here but the actual characters themselves, innocent though they are, are the net he is ensnared in. I personally love it. 

Now, to your second point.  Didn't you and I talk classic Who yesterday?  This is relevant because the Doctor is traditionally the underdog, the wandering bohemian, running from the Time Lords, the Daleks, the Black Guardian, all of whom more powerful than him wanting to manipulate or destroy him. Nothing is more boring than an all powerful hero. Ten was, rightly so, an aberration, a themee that can only be used once to show that the Doctor is *not* all powerful, all knowing or immune to manipulation. Wanna know why it's more interesting this way?  After you're convinced the Doctor is a pawn on a chessboard, he will change the game to poker, but you don't see the master strategist that Eleven is because you think he's going to let you in on everything like Ten did, so if he's not doing that and just bumbles around acting funny then you think he's just being goofy.  Let me clue you in: Ten telegraphed his moves to you through his companions because he trusted them completely.  Eleven doesn't trust his companions, even when they *aren't* clones, because he can't risk letting his enemies know that he knows he's in a trap, and since he isn't telling them, he isn't telling you so you have to look for the subtleties which is why Smith's Doctor is so badly *misunderstood* by fans of a specific Doctor but loved by fans of The Doctor as a whole because he brings mystery hack to the character after his last incarnation being an open book.

Also why should Sarah-Jane not have returned by Watercups logic? Davies ressurected the series, wrote some new characters and brought back some old ones, not dead ones though. I do not understand your grasp of logic. Sorry but I don't.

The government has never cared, they're just concerned with staying in power long enough to secure themselves fat sallaries (linking in with the greed again).

I don't think anyone really thinks the Queen is better than anyone else, she's just sort of always been there. I don't really consider myself to be pro-monarchist but at the same time I realise that the expenses required to maintain a head of state would be exactly the same if we had an elected head of state, those costs wouldn't just disappear if we kicked out the royal family. 

I could also make some points about how the Crown Estate actually benefits the country more than it costs us, but I can't be bothered rooting out all the sources. Essentially the only money the Queen actually gets given is from the Civil List, which is skimmed off  of the profits from the Crown Estate (basically all the land in the UK run by the government on the Crowns behalf). The government keeps the rest. Yes various royals have private estates which they make money off of as well, but that's no different than any other rich tosser. (e.g. bankers paid fucking ridiculous bonus' with our money for no reason.)

The Civil List works out to about ¬£6-10 million, most of which is spent on the wages of staff and palatial maintenance. We didn't spend billions on the royal wedding. Pretty sure the only public funds used during the ceremony were for security, which also benefitted the public as there were so many people gathered.

Season 1 I like The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances and that finale of Badwolf/The Parting of the Ways.

Season 2 probably New Earth, The Girl in the Fireplace, and that finale Army of Ghosts/Doomsday.

Season 3, Smith and Jones, 42, and of course Blink.

Season 4..probably my favorite season, I liked The Doctor's Daughter, Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead, Midnight and the finale The Stolen Earth/Journey's End.

Season 5, The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone, and The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang and A Christmas Carol (probably my favorite Christmas special).

Season 6, so far I liked The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon. I think I liked The Rebel Flesh/The Almost People more.. and I liked A Good Man Goes to War (even though I ruined the surprise for myself early).

1. The economies are all generally shit at the moment, UK may have it worse than some, but there are worse off too. Everything costs more in Europe than the UK right now (well obviously not everything, wine is cheaper here). I import pretty much everything (white goods, clothing, electronics) over 100euro from the UK, paying delivery costs, and I can still save 20% on the price in some cases. 

    Toiletries etc. are SO much cheaper in the UK I import in bulk every visit. I took 20 bars of Imperial Leather for a couple of quid as the cheapest soap here costs 3 or 4 times the price.

    Food costs me twice as much in Belgium than in Sainsbury's.

    Not to mention, I have to pay OVER HALF my wage to the state, and I'm not considered a high earner (here, or in the UK).

2. The political systems are worse in many northern European countries... take a look at Belgium! Almost a full year since they've even had a government. The people involved in that debarcle must want the country to fall apart (in fact I'm sure they do as they are regional separatists).

3. I don't agree with the monarchy, but look at the rest of Europe. Some have monarchies, some don't. I'd get rid of them in an ideal world, but this one has baggage.

4. Again... it's more or less the same everywhere in northern Europe.

The tone of your writing gave the impression that bias wasn't what you'd expect to see in an article, and that you consider an article that has heavy bias to be of poorer quality to one which tries to stay central.

If someone has said something that pisses me off, which the Prevent article clearly has done to the author, I generally make it quite clear within my first few words.

And as for quality, one paragraph is a very short amount of words to really be able to make a fair and valid judgement on the whole article. I know you only said as an indicator, but that in itself is already putting you at a bias against the author.

&gt;Matters of opinion or fact are irrelevant

Only if you have judged something unworthy without taking the time to see/hear it at all. If you read it, you could at least have a constructive counter-view to demonstrate that you have issues with the piece, or you might even agree with it yourself.

We've had many more newcomers to the midfield and strikers, but if you look at our defense, Cech, Terry and Carvalho as the basis of our defense since 2004, and ever since then we've consistently had one of the strongest backlines in the league/world even. Ashley Cole has come in and settled beautifully, and while Carvalho has moved on, we've managed to introduce Ivanovic and Alex into the side pretty seamlessly.

Sticking with a 4-3-3 will make it much easier on our new coach as we will understand the formation and tactics already, so we can play better from the start, so I'm in favor of staying with it for now, as hard as that will be to manage Drogba/Torres. I don't think letting Lampard go now is a good move at all. He had a poor, injury filled season and so did Drogba, but both have been playing lots of football non-stop for the past couple of years. Given their age, I think a summer off to relax and recharge will ensure great seasons from both. After that, when they're 33/34, may be the time to sell. But for the upcoming season we should hold on to both.

4-3-1-2 also leaves us pretty narrow, which is why the diamond never worked. 4-3-1-2, with the midfield shape that we usually stick with, is actually pretty much the diamond (holding midfield drops deep, two central mids).",0,1307641287,null,0,false,0,c1yqmvd,t3_hvi25,t1_c1yqmvd,t1_c1yqke6,1427228889,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,mrdanny,uk,Edinburgh,"It's known as 'intruding r'.  From the [wikipedia article on rhotic and non-rhotic accents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents):

""Many non-rhotic speakers also insert an epenthetic /r/ between vowels when the first vowel is one that can occur before syllable-final r (drawring for drawing). This so-called ""intrusive R"" has been stigmatized, but even speakers of so-called Received Pronunciation frequently ""intrude"" an epenthetic /r/ at word boundaries, especially where one or both vowels is schwa; for example the idea of it becomes the idea-r-of it, Australia and New Zealand becomes Australia-r-and New Zealand, the formerly well-known India-r-Office. The typical alternative used by RP speakers is to insert a glottal stop where an intrusive R would otherwise be placed.""

I think it happens commonly in non-rhotic accents because of over generalisation.  In ""idea about"" from your example, the schwa I would pronounce at the end of 'idea' is the same as I would pronounce at the end of 'dear'.  Since Rs are pronounced before a vowel, meaning that the schwa in 'dear' gets an R added in 'dear Alfred', I suppose over time words ending with the same vowel sounds became treated the same way, creating greater regularity in the accent: if a word ending in one of these vowel sounds precedes a vowel add an R.

Non-rhotic accents such as general American never had the sound change of pronouncing Rs only between vowels to over-generalise.

¬£35 for a private checkup is about right, if they're scaling as well that's cheap for private, as is ¬£5 per x ray.

If they're seeing you on the NHS they should clearly tell you what is private, and what is NHS. A lot of the recent press about dentists has concerned people being told certain things weren't available on the NHS when they perhaps should have been. A pretty reliable way of looking at it is if it is *necessary*, ie a tooth is broken or has decay, infection etc, they should be able to treat it. That's not to say that every filling should be replaced with a white one, every gap with an implant etc. It's there to provide dental health. If it's purely by choice or aesthetics, like wanting a scaling when your teeth are clean and you don't actually need one, you pay private. You don't like your (otherwise sound) amalgam fillings and want them taken out and replaced with white ones, you pay private.

¬£17 on NHS covers a checkup, scaling *if necessary*, x rays *if necessary*. Next band up, ¬£47, covers any fillings, root canals, extractions (whether it's one or ten, makes no difference...or sense). Next band up, ¬£204, covers all of the above plus any dentures, crowns or bridges.

So if you go into your dentist and need a small chip on a front tooth repaired, and nothing else, you're in the chair for about 10 minutes and pay ¬£47. You need 6 teeth out, 2 root canals, 8 fillings and a clean? You're in the chair for over 3 hours...¬£47. Daft. But, it's the system.

true,Nomolos,null,null,"The only way that I could ever rationalize finishing Doctor who is in one way, by facing him with all of the darkness inside of him and somehow finding a resolution to it. With the examples of the Dream Lord and the Valeyard we have two examples of the Doctor openly acting against himself.  In my opinion his struggle with himself is almost always what makes most of his other struggles most powerful. Think Eccleston and the Daleks or Tennant and the Master, there is so much bottled rage in their performances, alongside self indecisiveness and pity, that these  performances were pretty amazing. Compare this to recent Dalek episodes where they simply get thrown into a historical period and despite the Doctors attempt to reason with the Daleks they all die of an indirect cause but save enough to keep their species going. The Doctor is no longer a being with an emotional core dangerously swaying between caring and vengeful, he is just responding to a threat. 

This is why I prefer the Master to many of the other Classic villains, he knows the Doctor better and acts accordingly. His actions often cause the Doctor to question his own nature and bring him to emotional extremes. Because of this he may not be as scary as some others, but he certainly has a more palpable effect on the Doctor. 

So what exactly would this sort of a finale thing entail? I don't exactly know, prior to a final episode there would have to be final episodes for classic villains and overall a theme of  ""look, shit it ending"". Probably similar in tone to Dalek from Season when the Doctor looks at the Cyberman head. The notion that he is an old being who is only growing older, and nearing his end. But not drawn out for ridicules effect like EOT part 2, something more subtle.

For an exact final episode? Gosh, it would depend on the actor, his version of the Doctor. It might be nice to see a final Master episode, maybe something in which the Doctor traps them both in some sort of Tardis induced time lock for the rest of eternity so that neither can ever effect the universe again after some drawn out themes about how they both effect the universe in bad ways. Only themselves and endless regenerations to burn off and no means of escape...

Or it could be something for simple, a monster of the week story with only the Doctor, a companion, and a threat. Simple, maybe underwhelming, but if done well it could wrap things up without being too dramatic. In the end to solve the problem he must give his life. His companion begs him to not because there is so much more to do, but he is beyond the egoism, so he gives in. After that maybe a monologue from the companion, who knows... 

Other than that IDK, but I would defiantly hate it if it was a ""kitchen sink"" episode that these past finales have been. It should be dramatic, but the focus should be on the Doctor, not a recurring villain, not a stream of companions, it is his end and it would only be fitting for him to take center.

true,Robotochan,cnty-england,Ashby-de-la-Zouch,"You make it seem as if there is just one single reason for the current attacks by terrorist groups, that the west has attacked the middle east.

Whilst it is true, that our steps in Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel and other places have played major parts, it by no means the only reason for their attacks. One of their strategies is to cause US to suffer an economic collapse, which in turn would ruin the countries who are supported by the US, in particular Israel. This would allow for them to establish their own ""pure"" state by taking control of the middle east. And assuming Israel and Pakistan don't use all their nukes before collapsing, that leaves Al-qaeda in a pretty strong position.

This would indicate that they have motivations other than simply killing foreign invaders, which is to spread their own version of Islam, which is the major difference between the IRA and Al-Qaeda. The IRA never used their religion as part of their reasoning for attacking, it was a political aim which allows for peace treaties to be made. An extreme religious group doesn't work that way, as it would be considered to be going against God to make concessions to none-believers. It's the difference between extremists and revolutionaries.

And as for the attacks on freedom, because of 9/11 and 6/6, we face ever growing restrictions and the rights of people have been rescinded in direct response to their actions. Because of their attacks, my 'freedoms' are less than they were before. At the moment, it doesn't affect me in any real noticeable way. But they do affect others and that is unacceptable.

true,mijj,null,null,"so far i've got upto the 10th Eccleston episodes in the new ones.

so .. differences between new ones and old ones i've noticed (beyond production quality):

1. SILENCE!
I've noticed the one real big difference between the new ones and the old ones (so far - 10 new one's isn't much, but i can see the trend) .. in the new ones, noone has shouted ""SILENCE!"" at the doc yet.

In the old ones, just about every episode has some insane meglomaniac or cruel guard barking ""SILENCE!"".

2. meal v. snack.
The old ones are set up like a multi-course meal. The new ones are like a bag of chips - very tasty but not designed for major nutrition.  With the old multi-course ones you may not like every course. A story set over a number of episodes gives a much better sense of being immersed in the world.  And a story over a number of episodes allows for changes of pace.

3. the cliff hanger! .. the old show was famous for it's horribly contrived cliff hangers 8-)  With one episode shows you don't get them.

PS. way back before i quit watching the show (before the doc had a past or a planet and nothing was known) i had the feeling that the doc himself didn't exist.  It was the tardis that was the being, and the doc was an emanation or appendage of the tardis.  Having a history for the doc knocks that on the head, i guess. .. wait! .. i have a story in mind! .. i'll have to take up writing.  The tardis is the mouth of a multi-dimensional being.  It creates the ""doctor"" as a lure to bring in unsuspecting adventuring companions.  These unsuspecting companions of the illusiory doctor are the staple diet of the tardis being. 8-)",0,1307662501,null,0,false,0,c1yszqe,t3_huong,t1_c1yszqe,t1_c1ypvrj,1427230065,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

However there's two things you should look out for if you want to spend more money.

1) 3KW element. This means it'll boil faster, some kettles have roughly half the power.

2) Concealed element. A concealed element requires less water in it to use, so you don't need to waste electricity boiling water you won't use. It's also easier to clean if you live in a hard water area. 

However if you do live in a hard water area, then you may just go for the cheapest kettle you can and chuck it when it gets manky.

&gt;As Defined by the National Weather Service;
&gt;
&gt;Waterspout: A violently rotating column of air, usually a pendant to a cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud, over a body of water with its circulation reaching the water. In the summer and spring, these phenomena are usually ""tornadoes over water"" that have been generated by thunderstorms. In the fall months, these most often begin as cold air funnels, being generated by a cold air mass passing over much warmer waters. Such waterspouts are generally much less intense than tornadoes and usually dissipate upon approaching shore.
&gt;
&gt;Tornado:
&gt;A violently rotating column of air in contact with the ground and extending from the base of a thunderstorm. A condensation funnel does not need to reach to the ground for a tornado to be present; a debris cloud beneath a thunderstorm is all that is needed to confirm the presence of a tornado, even in the total absence of a condensation funnel. It nearly always starts as a funnel cloud and may be accompanied by a loud roaring noise. Tornadoes are classified by the amount of damage that they cause.
