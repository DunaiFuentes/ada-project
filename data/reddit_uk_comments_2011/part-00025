They have less than 60 MPs. Despite this they have secured tax cuts for the poorest in society, pre-university education reforms that are more generous than anything labour have done and stopped conservative cuts on a catalogue of minority programs that could have been axed without any real labour opposition (think fuel allowance schemes).

For such a small group, they have done outstandingly well in terms of manifesto compliance. The university fees fuckup was horrible, but I have yet to speak to anyone who isn't a liberal democrat who can identify any more 'broken promises'.

&gt; EU would probably demand more of a contribution from British tax payers.

They do this almost every year. It's due to inflation and since we joined the EU in the 1970s, every government, Tory or labour, has obliged. I don't see what your point here is.

&gt; Also won't update our trident systems.

The tories have forestalled an update to trident too. To be fair this is because Labour acted with absolutely astounding hubris in their last days in power, spending almost all of the money that was supposed to be spent *after* the defence review before the election in contracts that prevented renegotation or cancellation. This is, amongst other things, why we are buying aircraft carriers but won't have anything to fly off them for almost a decade.

&gt; Should any western

No.

&gt;(or developed) country want to invade us

NO!
This is stupid. First, [NATO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO). Second [NATO, seriously](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO).

Third, excluding [NATO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO). The only countries which can attack us with nuclear weapons are Israel (who won't), India (who won't), Pakistan (who probably won't) and China (who probably won't). North Korea and Iran, even if they do have viable weapons, don't have anything that can reach us.

So given that its either Pakistan or China, what do you think will happen when they attack us and we *""only""* have trident, or even have nothing?. [NATO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) for one, France assisting because a nuke aimed at Britain is about as bad as one aimed at themselves (incidentally, France are also part of [NATO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO).

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've actually done briefings for a number of GP surgeries on these reforms, albeit it a year ago.

The NHS reforms could actually be a fantastic set of changes. They are not at all a first-step to privatisation of the NHS. Don't worry.

The national english NHS budget currently allocates funds to Primary Care Trusts (PCTs). They arrange all provisioning (i.e. paying for) of services.  Your GP on the other hand makes the requests for services. The hospitals are in the middle, getting money from the PCT and instructions from the GPs.

So the chain goes  

GP ----- payment for treatment request ---&gt; PCT ---- treatment / policy check ----&gt; Hospital 



The reforms will effectively give GPs most of the control over payment. If a GP feels that their particular surgery would benefit from a policy of treating certain healthcare issues (e.g. teenage pregnancies) in one way that's more effective for its community, then high-level planning from the PCT will no longer bar them (in actuality it's slightly more complicated than this, for a number of legal and instititional reasons the PCTs will remain in various reduced forms by region, but you can treat it as if they're gone for purposes of discussion) .

The two risks are that 

1) Individual **surgeries won't want to take on these management roles**, particularly as over the past decade a very (relative to other government bureaucracies) efficient and specialised workforce has developed amongst PCTs to do all this work

2) Surgeries will be working at a **level that is too small** for some of the long-term strategic planning and economies of scale benefits that PCTs provide.


Neither of these are insurmountable however. Based on the white paper and other bits and pieces I read from a year ago (some of the regulation might have changed):

1) Surgeries are free to either hire the staff from the PCTs to work on the localised system they have, or to arrange for provisioning across a [cluster](http://www.gponline.com/News/article/1029471/big-GP-consortia-be/). These federations of GP surgeries were already becoming very profitable pre-reform (remember, GPs are self-employed) and the new powers that the reforms envisage look like they'd drop perfectly into the cluster system.

2) This is really an area that shows how the reforms both have the potential to be radical, but are almost certain to have little short term changes. Based on the paper I read, it may well be **possible** for a rogue surgery to break off and do everything differently and on an ad-hoc basis, ensuring flexibiltiy for its GPs but pissing away money in the process.

I seriously doubt that will happen however. More likely, surgeries (and clusters, remember) will retain the best practices of the PCT system, including standardisation and general policies, but will retain a powerful ability to use discretion. If a particular patient or class of patients ought to have a new treatment regime available to them, it no longer requires going up the chain to PCT and negotiating. Though this will eventually enable surgeries to do all sorts of interesting and innovative stuff in the future, I think the majority of surgeries will stick as much as possible with their existing practices, changing only what they see as practices completely unsuited to their particular conditions.",0,1305618808,null,0,false,0,c1uho6e,t3_hcv88,t1_c1uho6e,t3_hcv88,1427154808,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Always good advice.

&gt; Regarding the breach of contract, you can be damn sure that rackspace have checked the terms of agreement to make sure they aren't in breach before doing this.

I would imagine so.  I host a couple of servers with Rackspace and although pricey, they are very professional.  However, I've also worked with lesser ISPs of the slicehost variety and wouldn't put it past them to try and sweep as much under the carpet of excessive terms and conditions as possible.

The key thing here (and remember, I'm just a layman so take it with a pinch of salt) is that companies will often state ""no refunds, ever"" in their T&amp;Cs even though the law is quite clear about when refunds can and should be made.  Even if you agree to the T&amp;C's, you can still retrospectively challenge them if you can show that they give rise to a situation where the consumer's rights have been suppressed.  If slicehost/rackspace are discontinuing an existing service and they are not able to provide an equivalent or better one for the same money then it could be argued that they are effectively seeking to terminate the contract early. In which case, they must refund all monies that you have paid for the service.  Of course, they would argue otherwise, if they were in the mood for arguing...

For the sake of £40, a company like Rackspace won't even bother their lawyers (who would charge them more than that to answer the phone).  If they won't respond in a friendly manner (and I bet they do) then the threat of a claim against them should be enough.  If it ever did go to the SCC they wouldn't contest the claim.

Tarriffs are not the solution. They are the complete opposite of consensual decision making. 

All of what you're saying is very difficult. To give the EU power to negotiate counter-measure tarriffs, as well as to give it general power to set taxes across Europe, would require huge changes to the foundational treaties. Ironically this is because euroskeptics wanted the EU's powers clearly delineated and restricted from unauthorised expansion.

What that basically boils down to is convincing Italy, France, Germany, Britain and all the other EU member states to cede taxation power, and in a great many countries that require referendums (probably all of them for something as big as taxation power), asking the public too.


Which gets to the general point; you need to stop hoping for the EU to solve this, because it can't.

The events of the Time War are already pretty clear at this point anyway.  It started was back in Genesis of the Daleks when the Time Lords started messing with the Daleks' timestream by sending the Doctor to their beginning to interfere with their development. The Daleks developed time travel pretty much to go after the Doctor and tried to destroy him before he could become such a huge threat to them and failed (The Chase). The Daleks' homeworld is destroyed by the Doctor (Rememberance) and then the Last Great Time War really gets going and that's when all the stuff we haven't seen onscreen happens which is that the Time Lords and Daleks essentially start to shred up the web of time along with each other. The 8th Doctor sees that either the war has to stop or time itself will cease so he sets up a huge time loop and throws everything to do with the war into it and seals it off from the normal universe. Either the energy released causes him to regenerate or some attempt is made to stop him and his 8th body is damaged enough to regenerate. We know what broadly happened and showing it onscreen would mainly just disappoint people and piss all over their pet theories as to the finer details. 
So I say keep Mcgann doing audios, which he is good at, and keep him away from the screen (I know the turdness of the TVM isn't entirely his fault, but he was in it so I still don't trust him to make good onscreen Who).

Nice, you open with an insult. Anyone who suggests Scotland might have a stable economy is a ""lunatic"". 

This report has been about for a few years and formed Tory/Labor policy on Scotland. If you have some *economic* evidence that it is incorrect them I'm sure hundreds of journalists would love to hear from you. 

&gt; Is this really the best Nationalist propaganda Scotland has? 

Right, so we get a hold of a ""top secret"" document that, describing a situation *that has not changed since then* that not only shows that we'd do extremely well but shows that this was deliberately hidden from us.

And given this, they best *you* have is to say it's ""old""? I don't even think there is an officially recognised logical fallacy for that one...

&gt; Apparently Scotland has just had a bail out for £470billion from the UK

No, two banks with ""Scotland"" in their name got bailed out. They are not ""Scotland"". Suggesting this is extremely dishonest and misleading. They are commercial entities with historic roots in Scotland, nothing more. The reason RBoS faltered was because of failed international enterprises. 

&gt; an independent Scotland would have faced financial “doomsday” if it had been forced to find funds of this magnitude

Would an independent Scotland have changed their laws in the same way as England, deregulating banking to the point of allowing this mess? That's quite an assumption. 

&gt; Look at Greece, do you think they have the same level of university education that provides such world class economists that Cambridge or Oxford could provide?

Does Greece have a large oil industry and massive investment from multinational technology companies? Does Greece have anything comparable to the 4th largest financial centre in Europe (Edinburgh)? Does Greece have anything other than tourism?

See, this is why we are getting upset. You don't realise that you are putting us down here, do you?

&gt; Who owns BP, by the way? 

Irrelevant, we're not talking about nationalising the industry. We just want the tax revenues that are currently being spent bombing brown people so that, ironically, BP can make even more money abroad in places like Libya. 

&gt; such world class economists that Cambridge or Oxford could provide?

Scotland already has many world class universities, some with extensively accoladed histories. Again with the put-downs. And don't get me started on Scotland's ""economist"" history. 

&gt; united we are stronger

United we get terrorists trying to slaughter us in the first ever Islamic attack on Scottish soil. United we get internationally embarrassed at being from the UK and waging war upon war. Between us and our US allies we have four significant conflicts waging at present. The ""British"" brand is tarnished. You won't find many Scottish companies proclaiming ""Britishness"" abroad these days. 

United we are apologetic. At least we can get to say ""I know, England-eh, wtf?"". 

&gt; What happens if companies that are primarily English clamp down on Scotland, and operate at much lower rates?

Given the economy we'd apparently have I think that would be more of England's concern, assuming we offer a better tax rate. 

But, if I'm wrong it would be a disaster. Us Scots are completely unable to look after ourselves. Without English firms clothing and feeding us we'd be feral within a few months. Right?",0,1305628347,null,0,true,0,c1ui0iw,t3_hbox6,t1_c1ui0iw,t1_c1ufudh,1427154978,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Now let's look at the US. They have two strong houses, and they manage to get almost nothing done at all. They just fight like a bunch of little five year olds and mud throw legislation. They have no intention of passing most legislation, but just pass it back and forth like a stupid game of chicken, who will blink first?    

In theory the HoL shouldn't work at all. It is a horrible idea. But yet it does work, and it works very well. Is it fair? No. It is rational? No. Does it work? Absolutely.    

Honestly, if the HoL got turned into another political house it would become exactly like the US. Either the Con controls both and does whatever they want, or they control one and have tons of their legislation bounced pointlessly just to score political points.    

How about this for an idea - the HoL is elected but political parties are banned. 100% independents. No whips allowed. Everyone votes on their morals and the big two get no additional power. Let's not pretend this ""reform"" is about what is best for Joe Average in the street, this is a power grab, nothing more nothing less.

""Forced competition"" for healthcare costs is really by design. One of the goals of the current PCT system was the create an artificial 'free market' inside the NHS to bring down costs and find efficiencies.

I don't see how forcing GPs to consider but not use all other solutions will result in anything less than best care either. There is nothing in these reforms that obliges GPs to take a certain treatment choice in those situations, is there?

To your last point, I do appreciate that some GPs have no interest whatsoever in provisioning (though you should know that, as many GPs take a keen interest in the business side of their surgeries, some are). The point is it's not really an individual GP who does this but their surgery. In the same way a surgery will have various clerical staff, IT, etc, money will be made available to them to hire staff competent enough to do this. 

These people will almost inevitably be ex-PCT staff, who do understand the requirements that hostpial staff is. The only difference is that whereas a surgery could come up against an inflexible PCT policy limit, they can now adjust or adapt the policy as they see fit.

I expect this will go down like a sack of bricks, but... There's a smell of carping about this post, perhaps I misread your tone unfairly, but it reads like you're miffed London gets an unfairly good deal compared to the rest of the country, and AFAICS that's somewhere between unsubstantiated and outright untrue.

&gt; Funding for olympics? London.

Not sure what you mean by funding for Olympics, I was under the impression this was coming out of London council tax payers' bills, at least partly, and zero on the council tax bill of someone elsewhere.  (If people in Exeter or Hull _are_ paying extra tax toward the Olympics, I will gladly agree that's bullshit.)  Also, people in Exeter and Hull won't have to deal with their shit getting fucked up by billions of people buggering their commute.  And overall, I'm a little mystified why you would resent funding for an event going to... the place hosting that event.  Where on earth _else_ is it supposed to go?

If some other city wants to bid for a major sporting event, and claim the funding for it accordingly, I don't think anyone's stopping them.  I don't know, maybe Manchester could host the Commonwealth Games or something.

&gt; Transportation infrastructure? London. 

Similarly, although I have failed to find a clear statement of such before my patience runs out, I am pretty sure TfL is at least majority funded by local taxes and fares paid by... Londoners.  

Crossrail, I might kind of give you that one (not really that simple, ref: GDP, below, but whatever.)

&gt; New government office? London.

London is the seat of UK government.  Why on earth would we build a new dept/office in, say, Liverpool and then have a tax and environmental burden shuttling MPs and civil servants between the two all the time?

Should we ever get a whole new form of govt (English Assembly) I would be willing to bet they (rightly) go out of their way to build that outside London.

&gt; Being second city means nothing when discussions about where to spend tax money or to create jobs are all about which bit of london to go for.

London generates 20% of UK GDP, with ~11% of the population.  I rather suspect actual figures about where tax money is spent would show proportionally more of it spent outside London, effectively subsidised by London.

I realise I'm not substantiating that claim properly, bcause I don't honestly feel like trawling through spreadsheets on *.gov.uk.  But then again, you didn't substantiate anything either.

Let's look at Time Crash, first as two fourth-dimensional timelines, then as a fifth-dimensional timesquare. If I were to spoiler-tag this, it would give everyone a headache. If you haven't seen it, go watch it on YouTube and come back when you're done. 

So, let's say there are two possible timelines for Time Crash. In one, the Doctor doesn't know what to do, he fumbles around at the TARDIS console for a few seconds, and there's a wibbly wobbly explosion. In the other, he remembers witnessing himself rectify the situation, and is thus able to emulate himself. This, you will well note, is the timeline we see. 

So, we've learned that all of fourth-dimensional spacetime exists ""simultaneously""; otherwise, how would the Doctor travel through it? The mind-blowing bit is that all of fifth-dimensional spacetime, that is, every possible timeline, exists simultaneously, as well. In Time Crash, Five's interaction with Ten moves our slice of the fifth-dimensional multiverse from the former fourth-dimensional sliver, in which the Doctor doesn't know what to do and there's a wibbly wobbly explosion, to the latter, in which he knows what to do.

It is nearly 40yrs old, that to me is old.. it's nearly twice as old as I am.

You don't actually have any points to make when addressing my previous points, other than 'herp a derp I'm Scottish'.

 I've just explained that the UK has bailed you out for over 400billion, to prop up your banks. Saying 'they only started in Scotland', lol and not actually thinking about the consequences if we hadn't of bailed you out, is idiotic. How many Scottish people have mortgages with these banks? They would be out of homes. How many Scottish people owe money to these banks? They would have assets seized. 

Who is your mortgage with, by the way? If you have one? It would be funny if you voted for this National party, and in the referendum Scotland does leave the UK.. and because of that, you lose your house. 

Don't think that, for one minute the rest of the UK wouldn't demand the debts that Scotland owes us. Deals BP has already done will have rigs up taking your oil, too. I'm not quite sure how that works out, has BP paid for a license to operate in Scotland? If BP has rights to that oil, Scotland won't get rich off it. 

If you sell this oil abroad, good luck when it runs out, because England, Northern Ireland, and Wales won't have your back after that now, will it?

To me it seems as though your herping and derping over points you've made, without anything really to back them up. The only link you have produced that says Scotland economy will thrive without England is one that is based on a document nearly 40years old, and has Scottish Nationalist quotes.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I had a bit of a story idea for it. Basically, it would involve the Master, sent back to the end of the Time War with the rest of the Time Lords, seizing the Moment (some generic device of Absolute Power) from the Eighth Doctor just as he's about to use it to destroy the Daleks and Time Lords, and in that instant, completely re-writes history from the end of the War. Basically, the Daleks win and the Master is now the Master of the Daleks, an all-powerful Time God. So, the future (everything since the new series began) is now altered and his powers start to ripple into the past. This is how you can pull together the random Doctors, as past and future are being destroyed by the Master's insanity.

It gives you an epic story worthy of the 50th anniversary, it can tie in all the eras of the show, and it also expands on an idea that RTD brought up in ""the Writer's Tale"" that I never considered until he mentioned it. He said he was never a fan of the Doctor team-ups, because it always seemed that the story was an after-thought to the gimmick. I'd like to think this is a worthy anniversary story that allows the different Doctors to meet up and have it not be about the gimmick.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;keep in mind that they always meet in reverse order,

The thing is, I know everyone keeps stating this, but it is blatantly not true. The Doctor and River Song are meeting up in **mixed order** only, not in reverse.

Don't believe me?

What purpose do the diaries serve? If they are meeting in reverse order, then they will *never* have matching entries. If the Doctor has already experienced something/where/time, then River hasn't yet. It must be still to come for her. So why do they bother to ask if the other has experienced something whenever they meet? How can they have **records that match?**

Why could they both remember Jim the Fish, and Easter Island?

But, if they *are* just meeting in random order, then the whole tragic love story meeting-in-reverse thing falls apart. Her [heartbreaking speech to Rory](/spoiler), the scene where [she kisses the Doctor for the first/last time](/spoiler), none of it makes any sense now.

Of course, you could just put it down to lazy writing, but I find it hard to believe they could make such a fundamental flaw. It's the defining thing about their relationship. They **keep meeting in reverse order**, and **have to syncronise themselves using diaries**. Yet these two facts are mutually exclusive, aren't they?

Besides, if they were meeting in reverse order, then that means that when they met in the Library, River knew pretty much from the start that, as it was the first time the Doctor had met her, it must also be the last time she would meet the Doctor. That certainly isn't the way that episode was written, acted or filmed.

The biggest giveaway is from this season, though. If they were meeting in reverse, then the next time we will see River (from the Doctor's point of view) is 200 years into the Doctor's future, on the [day he dies](/spoiler). Think about it. Next time for him is the previous time for her? When did River meet this latest Doctor? In the cafe, just after [the funeral](/spoiler). So the *previous* time she met the Doctor (earlier that day), which is also the *next* time he'll meet her, he was [200 years older, and just about to walk to his death](/spoiler). So, that means no more River for the foreseeable future, then? I doubt that.

From the hospital perspective - currently hospitals bill the PCT per admission under a certain code whereby a tariff has been assigned to different types of admission (I'm not sure who sets the tariffs).  How would money flow to hospitals from the clusters?

true,crazylilting,welsh,Wales,"Very interesting.  As someone who moved here from Canada, i was shocked to find out how expensive things were, how limited shops were, and how poor customer service is.  

From my point of veiw Canada's land mass is perhaps 10 to 15 times that of the UK with half the amount of people spread out all over the country.  Yet everything is vastly cheaper in Canada then here.

We have 64 Million people here in the space of one province in Canada that has perhaps 3 Million people, It's hard to appreciate the size difference and understand just how much infrastructure it takes to connect cities in Canada.  Not to mention how much maintenance it takes to keep it working because of the harsh weather conditions that Canada has.  Yet their taxes are much lower then here in the UK.  They enjoy lower prices on almost all goods, have higher wages, and a better standard of living.

Their home depots are a dream come true for DIY'ers here in the UK.  B&amp;Q is a complete joke and their prices are extortion.  You would think with a market of 64 million we would have better shops, yet the opposite is true.  If you are lucky to find what you want locally, you will have to pay twice what it is worth and pull teeth to get any real service.  

And don't get me started on the communications sector.  What a joke.  Some of the lines are almost a hundred years old in this country and cannot support modern communications, yet BT milks profits off these lines instead of investing in the future.  Our cell infrastructure is so outdated we cannot even use the most modern phones that are on the market in other places in the world.

Look at the number of Lords defeats for the [last few sessions](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/research/parliament/house-of-lords/lords-defeats). During the Labour government, the House of Lords defeated the government five hundred times; the Commons seven times.

You also have to take into account the different cultures of the houses - for a start, the Lords are only more whipped *when they vote*, and that's the key thing. It's a more polite culture in the Lords. If you disagree with a policy, you show it by abstaining, often letting the vote fail.

And saying that the Cross-benchers simply 'don't turn up' is highly misleading. As in your own material, the figures are from the nineties, before the reforms to the House of Lords and I believe attendance has increased since then. Even more recently, the advent of coalition government saw the cross-benchers [taking their place](http://lordsoftheblog.net/2011/03/29/not-so-inbuilt/) as the fulcrum on which many big votes rested.

Not only that, but cross-bench speeches are rated highly by their peers as influences on whether to vote or not (from Lords of Parliament, by Emma Crewe).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; If it accounts for 20% of GDP, why does it account for 100% of special projects?

100%?  Be serious.  Liverpool and Glasgow have both been European City of Culture with extensive associated cultural investment.  The Sage and Baltic in Gateshead.  The Public in West Brom (albeit I know that was a bit of trainwreck, not sure if that's somehow London's fault too).  The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.  The Commonwealth Games in Manchester, as I already mentioned yet you mysteriously omitted from your quote since it doesn't support your view.  This is literally off the top of my head, there are doubtless many other projects I could dredge up with some googling. 

Silly exaggerations like that which can be disproven by naming even one counterexample are exactly what makes it smack of carping rather than a reasoned, fact-based debate.

&gt; Sorry, got a bid from london. You're not getting it.

You don't seem to understand how these things work.  I don't remember any Olympic/WC/etc bid process where two cities from the same country competed against each other.  The country decides within itself which city is going to go for the bid.  If your argument is that the UK _always_ insists on London for this and never any other British city, I refer you once again to the 2002 commonwealth games.  Or the 1999 rugby world cup.

&gt; I understand that you like that you dont need to move to get a high paying job

I _did_ move.  I wasn't born here.  I suppose I could have stayed put and whined on the internet about how it wasn't fair, but that didn't seem very constructive.

&gt; and theres only one possible destination

Well, you have freedom of movement and work within the whole EU, but again, don't let me interrupt the anti-london circlejerk.

&gt; I understand that you think its right that all the projects happen in london

Quite apart from the fact that they don't, even if they did, _I_ don't think that's right.  Not only did I not say this, I even plainly said the opposite (that I think it would be right to build an English Assembly outside London).

""I understand that your bitterness &amp; jealousy is blinding you to actual facts and sensible discussion"", look, I can make a snide strawman out of your posts instead of engaging with the actual points you make, too!

What I actually said is that I don't see that London is ""stealing"" anything from anywhere else.  If transport links are built to lead to where the most people are, and businesses choose to invest and create jobs where the most people are, that's not some nasty deliberate anti-region conspiracy, that's just how things naturally work.  I suspect it not only pays its own way, but inasmuch as there is any deliberate ""bias"" when it comes to redistribution of taxes etc, the numbers would probably indicate it's in the opposite direction.

If you want to bring any facts to contradict this (admittedly unsubstantiated) viewpoint I shall be more than happy to revise my thoughts and apologise for my innaccuracies.

As I understood, the actual flow of money could easily remain in the regional trust that lies at the core of each PCT. It's not actually the money itself that is getting redirected (a key reason why this can't lead to an NHS privatisation) just the direction to allocate it. I imagine whatever the difference is will be similar to the way the provisioning aspect of the PCT and the actual 'trust' aspect that holds money work now.

Could you elaborate on why you think GPs would delay or withold referrals? Though control of funding goes to the surgeries, it doesn't mean that they can allocate money to themselves arbitrarily. If they were engaging in practice that puts their own personal gain ahead of patient welbeing then they're in serious trouble. That kind of conduct could happen today if a GP was unscrupulous enough, do you have something different in mind?

Everything you've written about GPs getting clear information etc etc is sort of valid, you're basically bringing up the point (rightly) that GPs have no institutional knowledge of dealing with care provision. The point of the reforms is that GPs themselves will rarely be doing this themselves (they will be treating patients instead). Instead, they will hire staff from former PCTs who can act as the PCT does, but with more control and micro-management of funding possible.

OK, that was a baseless assumption on my part, I apologise.  

&gt; You cant say that london doesnt get special treatment when it comes to deciding where to put things. You cant then move on to say that its ok that london gets all of this cool stuff because its london.

That's not quite what I'm saying though.  I admit it gets more ""special stuff"", but what I'm arguing is that that's only in ""fair"" proportion (or perhaps even below proportion) to the simple fact of its bigger size, population and economy.  Not any deliberate ""unfair"" anti-regional agenda, per se.

Again, I didnt... I was more trying to say that ""blaming"" London isn't a solution either.

&gt; I dont want to live in london, I want birmingham to be better.

Fair enough.  I've got nothing against Birmingham being better either!  Perhaps I didn't make this very clear before, but inasmuch as I have a hunch that London's disproportionate GDP contribution gets distributed around the UK, I also think this is a good and rightful thing.  Or in simple terms: if London does in fact generate a ""surplus"" (due to international business/finance etc, most likely), I'm quite happy for that to be invested outside London, around the UK.  Birmingham or anywhere else.  

I think I read somewhere that income _inequality_ is a bigger cause of social problems than absolute levels of economic poverty, by the same general logic it's in nobody's interests for a huge gap to open up between London and Everywhere Else.  I just don't buy the idea that govt is actively trying to make the gap worse; I think capitalist economics probably _does_ (vicious/virtuous circle) but (and maybe I'm naive) I think govt is overall more trying to do the opposite.

It would be highly confusing - if you're used to driving in one standard (let's say metric) and suddenly there are no road signs stating distances or speeds in kilometres because they haven't been replaced yet. Would you advocate the removal of speeding as an offence while the signs are gradually changed and people get used to things?

true,EnderMB,null,null,"&gt; I agree with your points apart from BIT falling apart. Due to action of lecturers there has been some decent investment to the department recently, on top of this we are getting brand new labs starting next year when the new buildings are used.

To my knowledge the entire BIT block was never intended as a permanent home to begin with, so it's only natural that the whole department gets its own building.

However, I am sceptical that UWE will provide a building of similar quality to those at universities like Bristol and Birmingham. If UWE build enough lecture theatres to go around, large labs and kit them out with the same level of equipment you'll find at top universities then I think it'll shoot up the league tables. All in all, it's down to where UWE wish to place themselves in the next five to ten years.

I was quite optimistic about the expansion, especially as I attended one of the focus groups and suggested the option of investing in Frenchay Hospital to form a medical school to keep Britain's best neuroscience labs running and in UWE's hands; a suggestion that was well-received and noted in the planning document.

For me, Matt Smith has a very limited emotional range. He is starting to get better. He's always had petulant spot on. He does wonder pretty well too. He does well at the Word of the Doctor speechifying like a bible thumper preaching the Word of the Lord (which just seems so massively out of character for the Doctor, so even though he does it well I don't like it), and he's getting sad down better. His anger is so flat and dull, though... that's always been badly delivered. It's not a cold anger, that would be interesting, it's just hollow and un-angry. Smith's emotions, those he can do, are one dimensional, and he can't sustain them very long, aside from petulant, sad, or wonder.

Tennant has a fantastic range. He can sustain a performance, can seem out of control, or be subtle and multi-layered. Rage, cold fury, subtle anger, joy, wonder, fear, sorrow, regret... he does a great job.

The recent line ""Fear me, I've killed them all' was fairly good, delivered by Smith. By Tennant, however, it would be great. It would have had a subtle tinge of regret and sorrow at the end, as well as a hint of danger, all bundled up into one. Smith's delivery was just monotone in comparison.

Tennant's take on ""[To be or not to be](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYZHb2xo0OI)"" was just fantastic, and shows what a great actor he is.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; THE ENGLISH GAVE TO SCOTLAND

It was forcibly released under Freedom of Information legislation. It wasn't ""given"". So stop shouting. 

&gt; It's not a secret and never was. 

Then why did McCrone say ""*When my paper was written it was classified “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.*"" in his correspondence during April '75? He was hinting to the incoming Tory government that they too should keep it secret, which they did.

The first word of the original report is SECRET. It's in bold and somewhat difficult to miss. You clearly haven't even looked at it. Afraid it might disagree with the conditioning you have that all Scots are good for is sponging off the state and playing the bad guy in Eastenders? :-)

&gt; It is nearly 40yrs old, that to me is old.. it's nearly twice as old as I am.

Has mathematics changed since then? Has the oil price crashed to the floor? Has Scotland faltered in it's economic development? 

The situation today is more positive than it was in the 70s. Is age the only criticism you have for the report itself? 

&gt; You don't actually have any points to make when addressing my previous points

I addressed everything except perhaps the suggestion I worked for the SNP. I don't. My support for them exists purely because Labour and the Tories have shown themselves to put their own interests ahead of mine. As an example of what is commonplace, Labour recently voted against minimum alcohol pricing in Scotland to neuter the SNP, while voting *for* it in England. The SNP is the only party that seems to have ""my back"" at the moment, as you yourself put it. I'm not hearing any love out of the other constituents of the UK that you list and it's been that way my entire life. 

&gt; Saying 'they only started in Scotland', lol and not actually thinking about the consequences if we hadn't of bailed you out, is idiotic. How many Scottish people have mortgages with these banks? 

How is it idiotic? We aren't talking about the Bank of England here, this isn't an official central bank tied to the currency or anything. Lots of Scottish people have mortgages with them, as to lots of English people. Lot's of Scottish people have mortgages with the failed ""English"" banks. International borders don't mean much in finance; look at all of the cross-EU bailing out going on right now. 

The government bailed out the RoBS not because the consequences would be really bad. The issue was that a failed bank kills confidence and destroys the lending market as other banks get worried about their own liquidity. The lack of equity for investment kills economic development for everyone, from the person getting a loan to refit their kitchen to someone getting a bank loan to fund the next .com success story. The bail out was an forward investment for the benefit of everyone.  (or so the theory goes)

&gt;They would be out of homes.  How many Scottish people owe money to these banks? They would have assets seized.

You really think that's how it would go down? People kicked out of their homes because their mortgage provider collapsed? 

&gt; Who is your mortgage with, by the way? If you have one?

Alliance &amp; Lester, a formerly English bank now owned by a Spanish conglomerate. 

&gt; Don't think that, for one minute the rest of the UK wouldn't demand the debts that Scotland owes us.

Such as? Of course there will be a proportional spilt of national debt but the same applies to national assets. We'll get to sell approx 1/4 of all of your embassies back to you. It'll all work out. 

We also have *all* of the nuclear submarine facilities which we will of course offer favourable berthing &amp; refitting rates. The English didn't want these controversial facilities built in their backyards originally and the chances of that happening now are even less. 

Is this the ""have your back""? We had Russian nukes pointed at us because of them. Gee, thanks mate! 


&gt; I'm not quite sure how that works out, has BP paid for a license to operate in Scotland? If BP has rights to that oil, Scotland won't get rich off it.

They pay taxes on the oil that is extracted. At the moment this goes to westminster where it is ultimately invested back in BP via military campaigns in Libya and Iraq. ;-)

&gt; f you sell this oil abroad, good luck when it runs out, because England, Northern Ireland, and Wales won't have your back after that now, will it?

Again with the ""we need you"" stuff. Economy-wise we doing very well *without* the oil. It would just be icing on the cake, the producer of that ""embarrassing surplus"" as mentioned in the report. 

&gt; To me it seems as though your herping and derping over points you've made

Not really, I'm making references to cold hard facts that are easily verified. Edinburgh *is* the fourth largest financial centre in Europe. Scotland does have an incredibly disproportionate share of the UKs hi-tech industry, sometimes coin'ed ""silicon glen"". Both of these industries have now come together, with huge international banks setting up huge IT development houses in the Scottish central belt (creating much work for folks in my field). 

&gt; The only link you have produced 

I don't have to add html tags for my points to be valid. If you dispute the economic success of Scotland then surely you should be the one providing links? Where is the proof that we ""need"" you?

Your last point is particularly interesting though as no one uses a metric time system.

true,smacksaw,canada,Quebec,"Fuel by the litre is the biggest ripoff because they can tax you 4 times per gallon by using the litre if they so choose. Also, price fluctuations have a different psychological effect.

In Quebec, when I see fuel for $1.34/l and it goes up to $1.44/l, it doesn't seem much different than when I'm in New York and it's $4.09/gal and then it's $3.99/gal in VT.

Because that $0.10/l is really $0.38 difference per gallon. That's not $1 when you fill 10 gallons, it's $3.80!

The whole [""You gave me hope, then you took it away, that’s enough to make anyone dangerous""](/spoiler) speech when [he finds all the Timelord distress beacons](/spoiler) could have easily been a 10 line.  For those doubting, compare it to his line in the Silence of the Library/Forest of the Dead two parter when he warns the Vashta Nerada by saying ""Don't play games with me! You just killed someone I like, that is not a safe place to stand!"".  Both lines could be delivered by either 10 or 11 effectively. That's what I like to see, a different face, different tastes and personality quirks, but the same man who loves to explore the universe, right wrongs, and fly around in his beloved blue box. 

I think it's a good sign though.  While the Doctor is different each time, you hope there is something in there that helps the audience mentally accept that this is the same man. 

It does surprise me how many people either insult Tennant fans or try to paint him as the worst Doctor of the 11. It seems like a genuine over reaction to the fact that some people like him. Fine, you think 11 is just as good (Tennant was my Doctor, and he even surpassed Baker in my mind, but I'm beginning to like Smith more than him. Just because you like Smith though doesn't mean you have to imply that Tennant was crap. Have some balance!) 

I understand that some Tennant fans didn't give Smith a fair chance, but some people are being just as bad going the other direction.

&gt;  I don't buy that our sense of self is based on how others perceive us. I've taken too many psychology classes to even start to believe that. I'd say maybe a sense of identity classification, but not ""self.""

&gt;  I also think that the monsters work differently than how the article says they do. I think the Silence work on the fear of the unknown. As soon as you are done seeing them, you forget them. The Silence become unknown and are up to who knows what kinds of scary things. I believe the Weeping Angels work in a number of ways. First off, they take the form of something that are generally seen as pure and good, angels. The Weeping Angels break our sense of trust in things we thought we could trust unquestionably. Secondly, the Angels are statues. Of course, the Angels are also super fast and can kill you or zap you back into the past before you even know anything is awry. This also creates fear because you have to keep your eyes on them if you see them. Else, you will not last. Have you ever tried not blinking? It's very difficult. Even while trying not to blink, you'll likely blink a few times. Death by the Weeping Angels is practically inevitable.

&gt;  A little offtopic, but worth adding to this conversation, I think neither of the mentioned monsters are scary. What I like about Doctor Who is that it gets me to question the mundane things I take for granted. That guy tapping his fingers, is he brain washed? Are we all being brainwashed?

Everyone I know, but then I'm Canadian.  You'd also find oodles of references to them in media such as printed literature and films that come from outside the U.S.

The reason for it is simple: Ignorance.  We non-cowboys don't know the difference.  We don't know that not all Americans aren't Yankees but we refer to them like so when we say ""Yankee go home"", and we often call our handkerchiefs ""kleenexes"" for the same reason.  They're infamous names we've applied wrongly to a larger set.

Chain of events:

1. Rory, in death throws, gets erased from history.

2. Rory is brought back as plastic-Rory using a brain scan from Amy.  He has Roman stuff in his head, but remembers being Rory.

3.  Amy remembers Rory, gets put into the Pandorica.  Rory is still plastic.

4. Plastic-Rory lives 2,000 years protecting Amy, resulting in Big Bang 2.  The Doctor is erased.

5.  Amy remembers The Doctor, pulling him back into existence.

6.  Suddenly Plastic Rory is Rory, who knows about Plastic Rory, and is not in death throws.


Timey wimey stuff does not seem good enough in this case to show that Rory was brought back into existence, ever.  Or that even if he was, he could know what plastic-Rory knew (who was created from a brain scan of Amy).  Thoughts?
(It is entirely possible that I am making a bigger deal of this because I don't like Rory.  He is a wimp, pansy, and overall borring person who is undeserving of somebody as adventurous and exciting as Amy.

true,kinggimped,cnty-expat,Expat (Shanghai),"No, you're right. We Brits kind of straddle the fence between metric and imperial. Distances on road signs are given as miles *and* kilometres, which has somehow ingrained an approximate conversion system in my mind, even though I never learned the actual rates for converting. Kind of like how I know that 30cm is about 12 inches, just because that's how the rulers I used back in school were marked.

At school everything was metric. To the best of my memory, we were never officially taught how many litres to a gallon, or kilos to a stone, etc.

I think a lot of it is tradition. Petrol's standard unit of measurement for efficiency is miles to the gallon, and you don't get much more traditional in England than a pint of beer. Converting them to metric doesn't serve much purpose.

I travelled around Europe for 6 months in 2009 and everything was metric. It actually made things some most of the time, since I was more accustomed to mixed measurements.

Now I live in China where they have their own fucking units for most things - food prices are given per kilo but you order them by the *jīn*, which is half a kilo. I don't even know the Chinese word for kilo (probably *liǎng jīn*, ""2 jin"", but that might be even more confusing since *liǎng* has multiple meanings - one meaning is ""two"", but another meaning is another unit of weight, which equates to one tenth of a *jīn*). Most Chinese units seem to approximate to metric measurements, though sometimes strange divisions of them - for example, a standard unit of length in China is a *chǐ*, which is exactly one third of a metre.

Save your faux moral outrage for the drug companies that charge £20,800 for a 10 month course which, on average will extend a suffer's life by 8 months. 

Don't get me wrong... if I was dying of bowel cancer and had the chance of an extra 8 months to live, I would jump at the chance (well, I might not be up to jumping, but you get the idea).  The difference is, I wouldn't expect someone else to pay for it at any cost.  If it came to an extra 8 months for me or a life saving operation for a baby then it's an easy choice to make.

Distances I tend to do in miles. Yards and 100s of metres are fairly interchangeable for low values. Anything less that 100 metres is in metric, but used to be in inches. I started going metric in the late 60s, it just made more sense to think in powers of 10 when dealing with electronics.

I don't drive anymore so I don't buy petrol. Milk I get in 568ml bottles, beer by the pint, wine and spirits in cl bottles. I don't drink fizzy drinks much.

I was taught imperial measures at school but learned some of the metric system growing up (mostly to do with electronics where it made things easier because of SI units).

My cookbooks are mixed, the older ones are imperial, the newer ones both or metric.

But for all that he is also a complete liability, the performances against Barcelona and Man United in Europe ( I was so angry with him for letting the team down after the united game I wanted him to leave then) for example and the consistent falling over and rolling around is very frustrating for me as a Chelsea fan. I'm still not sure why he does it and what advantage he hopes to gain by it (even as gamesmanship sometimes it's completely ineffective).

He also just doesn't play as well if he is chosen out of position or from the bench, in other words he sulks, at the end of the day he is a Chelsea player and the manager is his manager and he needs to accept the managers decision and play the best he can even if it is out of position and he believes this is not the best way for the team to play. he was hardly vindicated against Manchester United in the first half (although it was more the midfields fault on that particular occasion).

But after all that I can't decide, this would be probably the last season we would get £10mil or more for him,and I can't see him being happy to play second fiddle to Torres next season, but when he is playing the impact he can have is unbelievable.

 - people's weights in kg  
 - temperatures in degrees centigrade

 - beer in pubs in 500ml glasses  

The only thing that we still usually used imperial measurements for was people's height. People were ""6 foot tall"" not 183cm. It's odd now that you mention it.

The British semi-metric system is just wierd. For me it felt like a big step backwards, into a past where people are holding out against a change to the right way to do things.

It's not a generational thing, a 22-year-old British person would do it the same hybrid way as a 42-year old Brit. 

The UK could change, but it would take a few years (5 years for people to get used to it? 20 years to train a whole new generation?) of just insisting on complete metrication - i.e. change your speed limit signs to km/h, etc. 

And of course the biggest question of all - regarding the national passtime - would the UK change to a 500ml ""metric pint"" of beer, sell 568ml ""pints"", round up to 570ml, 600ml or what? Untill the beer question can be properly answered, it would be difficult.

I think you'd be better off afterwards, but is it worth going through the inevitable reisistance of people who just don't like change?  They probably have some patriotic thing going, and see the old ways as more English - *if pints, pounds and miles were good enough for Oliver Cromwell, they're good enough for me.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes, that's it exactly. Fuel consumption is the most intuitive way to think about fuel use in cars, but MPG shows more favourable mileage statistics, which is why car makers like it.

For instance, take Car A which gets 20 MPG, which is 14.12L/100Km. Car B which gets 25MPG, which is 11.3L/100Km, so if you were to upgrade from A to B, your fuel economy would increase by 25%, but your fuel consumption would only fall by 19.98%. So, assuming you drive the same distance, a fuel economy increase of 25% only results in a ~20% saving in fuel costs (and emissions, etc).

Now say Car C has a fuel economy of 31.25 MPG, which is 25% greater again than Car B. 31.25 MPG is 9L/100Km, which again results in a ~20% reduction in fuel consumption. However, the amount of fuel saved by switching from B to C is less than that saved switching from A to B. The 25% increase in fuel economy from A to B (20 -&gt; 25 MPG) resulted in 2.82L less fuel per 100Km, but the 25% increase from B to C (25 - &gt; 31.25 MPG) only results in 2.3 L saved per 100Km. A further 25% increase (31.25 -&gt; 39.0625 MPG) would only reduce fuel consumption by 1.8L, and so on. The higher the MPG, the smaller gains are in the real world where fuel consumption is what matters.

In addition, this means you can't easily (without converting to fuel consumption, either L/100Km or GPM) compare two cars and see exactly how much fuel, and therefore money, you would save.

Everything you say is correct, for sure. All I'm saying is that manufacturers, where they can get away with it, prefer to show fuel economy because it is not generally understood that MPG is not a linear scale. Many people think that the 5 MPG leap from, say, 25 MPG to 30 MPG is as big a leap as from 20 MPG to 25 MPG. It's an extra 5MPG right each time, right?

In reality, 20 -&gt; 25 MPG will save them 2.82L or ~£3.85 at the average English price per 100Km driven, but the 25 MPG -&gt; 30 MPG leap with only save ~1.88L or ~£2.55. MPG was chosen because of this trait - it obfuscates the true fuel consumption behind another metric, fuel economy, and allows the MPG number to go up faster than the cars are lowering their fuel use.

There's nothing mathematically wrong with MPG, but ideally L/100Km (or GPM, if you want to stay Imperial) should be what mileage is given as, because fuel consumption is more transparent than fuel economy.",0,1305723732,null,0,false,0,c1upasp,t3_hdg2g,t1_c1upasp,t1_c1up36e,1427158485,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

This comment makes me think that he doesn't actually know what constitutes 'date rape'.

If he's saying that statutory rape isn't as harshly punished as rape, and using that as an explanation for why the *average* length of conviction is only 5 years, he's right. Statutory rape should be classed differently, and clearly consensual sex between a minor and an older individual shouldn't carry as harsh a punishment as rape. Milliband, Yvette Cooper *et al.* would accept that without question.

The opposition seem to be picking up on the fact that he's attempting to draw a line between 'violent' rape and 'date' rape. If he is actually trying to do that (rather than just mangling the definitions of date rape and statutory rape), then, yes, he's an idiot, and should face some form of repercussion.

**Edit:** [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13436429) from the BBC:

&gt; Ken Clarke has declined to apologise after he appeared to suggest that some rapes were less serious than others.

&gt; It followed a BBC interview about sentencing proposals in which he referred to ""serious rape"".

&gt; The justice secretary later returned to TV studios to stress that ""all rape is a serious crime"" but added he did not think he had suggested otherwise.

&gt; Labour leader Ed Miliband had said he should quit for effectively suggesting there were ""other categories of rape"".

So they're not taking the 'date rape' angle either - it seems that it's just the suggestion that there could be various categories of rape that is causing the issue. It's that sentiment that I'm agreeing with.

**Edit 2**: This is the quote (from that same article), that I just heard, and that seems to be the centre of this:

&gt; When BBC interviewer Victoria Derbyshire interrupted to say ""Rape is rape, with respect"" Mr Clarke replied: ""No it's not, if an 18-year-old has sex with a 15-year-old and she's perfectly willing, that is rape. Because she is under age, she can't consent... What you and I are talking about is we are talking about a man forcibly having sex with a woman and she doesn't want to - a serious crime.""

People who have a legitimate need to use it for medicinal purposes can then grow it freely without fear of prosecution.  Those who want to use it recreationally can do so without having to deal with criminals and support a black market.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Two scenarios:

1: A teenage girl is attacked in a dark street by a stranger. She is beaten, raped and left bleeding. She tells the police as soon as possible.

2: A teenage girl hooks up with a friend of a friend. She goes back to his, they fool around and a few clothes come off. He says he wants to have sex. She says she's not sure. He gets pushy. She says no. He persists. She knows she doesn't want to have sex, but she feels that the pressure from him and her peers is such that she doesn't feel comfortable refusing. She's also scared that if she puts up a physical struggle, he might hurt her. She seems to go into autopilot and stops resisting. He thinks (if he thinks at all) that she's given tacit consent. Afterwards, she grabs her things and runs home, feeling miserable, dirty, used and confused. Some time later she tells someone she trusts what has happened, but she doesn't want to use the word rape. Her friend encourages her to tell the police, but she refuses, knowing that it's her word against his, and that any trial would force her to revisit an experience that she just wants to forget. And anyway, she thought she liked this boy and she doesn't want him to go to prison. The experience colours her life and her relationships for decades to come. Her rapist goes on to do the same to other people, each time not realising the harm he is doing.

Both scenarios are serious crimes. Both cause immeasurable harm and trauma. But our legal system only seems designed to deal with the first. I personally know of perhaps one or two people who experienced something like the first scenario. I know of many more who have experienced the second.

I don't know what the answer is. I think it mainly lies in educating people - mainly boys - about the harm caused by both kinds of rape. I also think that there's scope for a debate on whether incidences of the second type of offence could be reduced, and prosecution rates increased, by calling it something different, or treating it differently. Whatever the answer, something needs to change. The status quo is not working.

true,deroy,tardis,TARDIS,"I always thought it had something to do with the fact that American media saturated British markets so much.  Paired with the fact that most American actors tend to speak/train to speak in a non-regional dialect, like newsreaders (unless of course the part calls for a specific accent).  So it seemed to me that foreigners have greater exposure to a non-regional U.S. accent.

From that I thought Americans had a harder time because when we see British films or have actors speak in their native British accent - they tend to speak in a wide variety of regional accents.  I always thought Americans putting on British accents sort of threw together the accents that they heard (making certain words or phrases come out with one accent, say a Yorkshire accent, while others pop out South London).

That's the best I can manage.  But I always think of how non-southerners have a horrible time with an authentic American southern accent (you can see this if you've ever seen True Blood.)  In the south, states (and even within certain states) there are very distinct accents that a lot of people really can't replicate.  So you have a cast that are all supposed to be from Louisiana and half of them sound like they are from Tennessee and the other half are somewhere in Alabama.

That was my roundabout way of trying to make sense.  Perhaps it's easier for foreigners to do a non-regional U.S. accent because they are greatly exposed to it (and American films/television and news programs prefer and use that sort of accent) while British media features a more diverse group of accents with less exposure in the U.S.",0,1305749774,null,0,false,0,c1urxpn,t3_hec9l,t1_c1urxpn,t1_c1ureh8,1427159708,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Since Matt Smith is the 11th Doctor, and cannon has established that a Time Lord is limited to 12 regenerations, this is something the writers have had some pressure to address since David Tennant stepped down.

The Doctor re-created our universe using Amy's mind combined with the ""quantum data"" from the previous universe trapped in the Pandorica. So assuming that Amy and Rory are like every other 20-something couple in the world, they had pre-marital sex.

Imagine that when Amy brings the doctor back into the Universe, some of that energy bled over to the still gestating fetus in her womb. The child it's self is literally a Paradox. Created in the previous universe, and exposed not only to the rifts in space/time that Amy was exposed to, but the energies of the TARDIS and the 're-born' Doctor.

I think this is partially why the 1000+ year old Doctor was so familiar with the Astronaut before it killed him. They were literally addressing a Paradox of two Doctors existing in the same universe.

This also explains why Amy's daughter was so... okay with her regeneration. She is the Doctor, with his memories, but in a newly formed body. One that is actually compatible with Universe 2.0, and not a relic of things past.

At least, that's my take on it.",0,1305756691,null,0,true,0,c1usof8,t3_heavo,t1_c1usof8,t3_heavo,1428202731,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12

As much as it's a problem having all types of gaming and anime events, it's also a strength. It means that as interest for different aspects grows and shrinks over time we keep a range of activities to suit most tastes. It's kind of how the club that runs Q-Con has grown (QUB Dragonslayers), and it definitely reflects that. We had an open to all meeting about Q-Con a few months ago where we discussed downsizing various aspects of the event to focus more; but the number and volume of complaints at the mere suggestion canned that idea on the spot...


We decided against big name guests on recent years for lots of reasons (we did used to bring people over every year), but it mostly came down to cost, capacity and interest. To get a decent guest over, put them into a good hotel for the weekend, feed / water them, and put on panels with them can cost a few thousand pounds. The charge to an attendee is only £15 which is less than half of every other similar event in Ireland or the UK. It's also difficult to find a big name guest who would be of interest to a good slice of the events demographic (Card Games, Consoles, RPGs, Wargaming, Cosplay). Also, if we got a big named guest who would draw a crowd - we'd run out of room because the venue is at capacity.


We do always have at least a few local guests from the gaming, comic and anime communities... given our budget it's really all we can afford to do (...that said if anyone is owed a favour by Patrick Stewart or Vin Diesel, please get him in touch :D ).


Some of the ""more seasoned"" attendees at the event have been rude to other attendees (maybe 3 or 4 reported incidents)... and given what they'll say to complete strangers, I'm sure you can imagine what they have said to me for ""bringing bloody cosplayers to [their] convention"". If we get any reports of abuse, including verbal, we do follow up on them - People have been politely asked to leave over inappropriate behaviour, and others have been perma banned.


If you have any specific questions about the event, or any suggestions to improve - please send them over... Also, if you'd like to join in any help out give me a shout. We appreciate all the help we can get.


TL;DR - Very diverse because it's run by a very diverse games club. It's on a very tight budget, and guests cost more money than we have. Some ppl are assholes to others; report them and we might ban them.

It's like with River, who began in ""Silence of the Library"" as a gimmick just for me to get past the fact of, 'Why didn't the archaeologist break into the library and arrest the doctor?' The psychic paper isn't going to cover it because he's in a deserted library. So one of the archaeologists knows him, so that's a bit lame, but it wouldn't be lame if he hadn't met her yet?

This is just how writing works.  It's not all making a master plan from the start and staying faithful to the grand plan.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Let's be clear here, Clarke's mistake was to use stupid phrasing, phrasing which reinforces a sexist-out-of-touch-tory stereotype. The substance of what he was talking about is valid.

Under the sexual offences act 2003 there are a catalogue of things that count as rape.

1) Violent / 'serious' rape

2) Intentionally non-consensual / 'proper' rape

3) Sex with someone who can't consent / 'drunk rape' (this offence depends on the state of the woman raped)

4) Sex with a minor with knowledge or grounds to know / 'sex with a teen'

5) Statutory rape of a very young minor / 'sex with a child'.


Of the above, only 5 / statutory rape is its own category of offence, and you still get labelled a rapist. 

The point clarke makes is that it is confusing and unfair to label all of the above offences as rape, especially given from 3-5 it is arguable whether a defendant actually had any intention or awareness of their actions (this doesn't mean they shouldn't be punished, something as serious as non-consensual sex rightly requires people to take care around it).

The position from labour is ridiculous. They may not know it but one of their best criminal justice reforms was the 2003 sex offences act, but it had defenciencies that have become clear over 8 years of practice, and blowing up over Clarke for being a bit of a tit isn't helping.

Evidence:

1. River and the Doctor always meet in the wrong order. She first meets him when she kills him. He also states that he ""knows who [the Astronaut] is.""

2. River is imprisoned for killing ""the best man she ever knew"" (AKA the Doctor)

3. When the Doctor is killed by the Astronaut, River's reaction is much more calm and collected than Amy and Rory's, because she already knew what would happen.

River, however, probably doesn't know who her parents were, possibly because she was taken by The Silence very young (The Silence created this odd pregnancy in S6Ep01 in order to destroy the Doctor, though I'm not sure how they would know this).

This would lead to a series finale in which Amy must choose between killing her own child and paradoxical friend River or keeping the baby and knowingly killing the Doctor.

Some of this is kind of obvious if you've watched them, but humor me for a second.  Some spoilage, I guess, but mostly conjecture.

* Amy sees a Silent first in Monument Valley, then in the Oval Office, and finally in the bathroom where she has the conversation.
* In the bathroom, Amy is under the impression that it was the same Silent all three times.  This is not corrected by the Silent, and even though I have my doubts, I will assume this to be true.
* If true, and if the statement made by the Silent is indeed meant to mean the pregnancy and Doctor's death respectively, how can the past version of the Silent know that Amy is pregnant and that the Doctor will die?
* The sparkling conclusion I have drawn is that the Silent (as a species) possess some time travel capabilities (hence the TARDIS from ""The Lodger."")
* But.  We get our first indication that something is not right in Amy's belly, as she clutches it upon leaving the bathroom, sans the grimace she has later in the episode when she's in pain.  If the Silent do indeed possess future knowledge, how would they not know that she loses the baby or not?  And if they caused her to lose it, why would they ask her to tell the Doctor that she is pregnant?
* At the end of ""Day of the Moon,"" she explains to the Doctor that she thought she was pregnant, but now no longer is and the TARDIS is confused as hell by her uterus.
* She couldn't remember what she was supposed to tell the Doctor, so she blurted something that had been swimming around in the pretty little head of hers anyway-the (at the time) fact of her pregnancy.
* From this, I have further concluded that a) the pregnancy of Amy Pond is intended to serve as a crucial plot point and as a red herring.  I believe it *is* important, but not as it relates to the Doctor's death, at least not directly; b) ""what he must know"" and ""what he mustn't know"" are the same thing; c) that thing is the Doctor's death; and d) the Silent orchestrated the Doctor's death.

A bit to sift through, but to point c above, the Silent, if I am correct about d, want him to know to ensure that he'll be there to die, which is why he must know.  But he also mustn't know because, being time travelers themselves, the Silent don't want him trying to save his own life and prevent himself from being there.

And while I'm on the subject of Spurs and whose in and out, I've noticed over the past few weeks that people want some fantastic players out because their stats aren't up to snuff.

Sports statistics are horseshit no matter what sport you are talking about. In particular, Peter Crouch.

&gt;It’s interesting, that rule. It was obviously bendable to begin with (the Time Lords gave the Master a whole new round of regenerations). So I’ve always thought that it was more a law like a speed limit is a law than like Gravity is a law.

""It seems to me there's so much more to the world then the average eye is allowed to see. I believe, if you look hard, there are more wonders in this universe then you could ever have dreamt of."" -Vincent Van Gogh

""The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don't always soften the bad things, but vice-versa, the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant."" -The Doctor

""To me Van Gogh is the finest painter of them all. Certainly the most popular, great painter of all time. The most beloved, his command of colour most magnificent. He transformed the pain of his tormented life into ecstatic beauty. Pain is easy to portray, but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world, no one had ever done it before. Perhaps no one ever will again. To my mind, that strange, wild man who roamed the fields of Provence was not only the world's greatest artist, but also one of the greatest men who ever lived."" -The Curator

Don't get me wrong I'd love to see a female Doctor just for curiosity's sake but it'd have to be done *so* carefully, like you say. 

If the Doctor regenerates as female she will then be a cis-female (as in female in mind and body) because her hormones, brain structure and body will be female. The only male part about her will be her memories. As with all Doctor's, she'd soon adopt her own personality and be on her merry way rather than dwelling or be caught up in his male memories, because he never does that with previous regenerations. It'd be over in one episode.

Now what constitutes a good personality for a female Doctor is certainly up for debate. Would she have more stereotypically female traits or mannerisms, for example?

true,smileyman,smith,Smith,"I think the reason the Doctor got so angry in that scene about information being withheld is because he thought that the Nose, the Legs and Mrs. Robinson were being threatened or coerced right then and that the information they were withholding was regarding current events. 

Beyond that I think there's no way the Doctor doesn't know that something bad happened to him there.

1.) He invited them all there, so obviously he learns at some point in his timeline.

2.) He knows the color of TARDIS blue as well as anyone else. Amy and Rory recognized after a year of traveling with him. He's been traveling in the TARDIS for 700 years.

3.) River slaps him as soon as he walks out of the bathroom in the diner. He then asks ""I guess that's for something I do in the future?"", and she says yes.

4.) River says that she can't talk about it because it's ""Spoilers"". That's a phrase that she only ever uses regarding him and major events. 

5.) River also says that the person that invited him there is the person that he trusts the most in the world. Other than the TARDIS, that person is him.

6.) Rory and Amy have been constantly huddling in corners and whispering while looking at him with serious faces. He may not know all the niceties of social interaction but he's damned good at picking up clues from people's behavior and figuring it out (The opening scenes in The Beast Below are a prime example of it).

7.) Amy shoots the girl in the astronaut suit (or at least the suit). The Doctor is yelling at her asking why she's doing it and she says ""I'm saving your life."" He was clearly in no danger right then, so he's got to realize that this refers to some future event. 

There's no way he doesn't know that he was killed. The only thing he's probably unclear on is the who (though we can assume he knows it's someone in a space suit), the exact details, and how far along in his personal timeline when it happens. 

For him this is not so much a whodunit, as it is a howdunit (i.e. how did they do it?).

Some people, even us ethnic minorities, feel an unease at the perception of being ""alone"" or isolated in some way. That is why you'll find communities built up in certain areas where people can feel comfortable, for lack of a better word, amongst others like themselves.

Now, for people like my parents who voluntarily emigrated from Nigeria to England in the 70's, it's something they were expecting and eventually got used to. It's also a factor that as children they grew up as part of the Empire and were somewhat used to White people in positions of authority anyway.

Now, I'm listening to this being debated on LBC and the majority of those who *do* think it matters are citing schools, religion, culture etc...

Most of these assume the people of other ethnicities are immigrants and not, like myself, people born here and educated here.

As usual it comes down to education. We already know that BNP support goes down the more diverse an area is. Obviously this happens as there are more minorities in an area not willing to support the BNP, but also you'll find the white support also falls rapidly. The more people spend time with their neighbours the harder it will be to spread lies and FUD.

Here is the thing. I am all for a show that is well rounded. A bit of everything. Sure. But like in firefly, my least favorite bit was Wash being jealous of Zoe (One of my favorite female actresses). That didn't even go on very long. It was just annoying. I am fresh out of high school (ok, spoilt, it's been a couple years) and I don't want to hear about who is dating who or cheating on who or who is having sex or wants to have sex or wants to cheat by having sex with or any of that. Females tend to bring that into shows and movies. Whatever the Doctor and River have balances very precariously on annoying. River is getting more bleh as she goes on about first and lasts and such. At least she has TOTAL BADASSERY to make up for it. 

I was so happy when they got done with the Rory is jealous bit. He had two modes ""I love Amy"" and ""Amy wants the Doctor"" and both were annoying. It's like Micky in season 1/part of season 2. Fortunately by the end of the entire thing he'd grown out of that.

But we don't have to look very far back in our own cultural history to see an example of us losing the plot as a nation. I'm talking about the death of Diana, the late Princess of Wales. It was in the news last summer because of the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, which you'll remember was a rubbish fountain. It fulfilled very few of the job description criteria of fountains. But it's ongoing, it never goes away. I remember when she died. About two days before the state funeral, I went down to Kensington Palace where Princess Diana had lived to look at all the tributes left outside. And in amongst all the bunches of flowers and sympathy cards and poems little kids had written, and drawings and paintings people had done what ever... In amongst all that, and this is true, I honestly saw a life-size inflatable model of ET. It was there outside Kensington Palace two days before the funeral. And I stood there looking at the inflatable ET for some 40 or 50 minutes. And I thought to myself, How did that get there? Who would have thought that that was an appropriate gesture? I imagined a household somewhere on that awful autumn Sunday morning where perhaps the wife had woken up first and she had watched the news and she went through to her still-sleeping husband, and said: ""Please. Please wake up. I need you to wake up and be with me now. There's been some terrible news. I need you to get up, come in the front room and watch it on the television with me cos I can't be alone, so please wake up."" But you know, He's asleep. He's going, ""What? It's fucking... It's half past 6 on a Sunday morning. I am asleep. I know I'm speaking but I am asleep. I don't want to get up. I'm asleep. So just... I know you're upset, but just say what it is. What is it?"" And she had have gone, ""Please. If you... If you love me, just this one time, just get up. It's an awful thing and I can't be alone. I need someone to comfort me and share. Just...please. Get up."" And he'd have gone, ""Look, I was out late last night. I've got work at 7...tomorrow. This is my... This is my one day for sleeping in. I don't want to get up till about half past 11, to be honest. Even then I'm not gonna get dressed, I'm just gonna be in my pants and stuff, just sitting around. I kind of... I don't know what you... If you just say what it is... What is it?"" She'd have gone, ""Princess Diana, Lady Di, has...she...has been killed."" He'd have gone, ""No! Not the Queen of Hearts! The Rose of England... And Scotland and Wales and bits of Ireland, no! How did it... There's no God! How did it... Why? How did it happen?"" She'd have gone, It was in a car crash in Paris last night. They don't know the exact details yet. But she's dead."" So presumably at that point, he'd have got up, got out of bed, tried to get dressed, get some kind of grip on his emotions and his feelings. Calm down his grief. And then he'd have said... I'd better go out and get a life-size inflatable model of ET. You know... For the gates of her home."" And his wife would have said, ""Yes. But you'd better hurry cos there'll be a rush on those now. We don't wanna be the only people not putting one there."" I was talking about this on stage in Croydon and a bloke shouted out, ""I was there! And I saw that!

The Doctor did refer to himself as the 11th in the episode ""The Lodger"".. earlier in the series in the first episode we see a slide-show of sorts showing all the previous doctors and of course there was no doctor before the 1st.  A similar slide-show was shown in the Christmas episode ""The Next Doctor""

In the old series the 5th doctor mentioned he was the 5th in ""Mawdryn Undead"" and in the ""Five Doctors"" he tells the 1st Doctor he is on his 4th regeneration.  The first doctor uses the line ""I was the first, the original you might say!"" in that same story.

What a patently ridiculous comparison you're drawing here. The difference, if it wasn't apparent, is in *every* case you cite above there was a quick arrest and conviction, apart from the Marvin Henry case in which the accused are to stand trial in June this year, and the last one in which the kid didn't die and so the press will ignore and no other news about it will be available even if there are convictions.

The Damilola case did draw similar press coverage as the Lawrence case and it was, in both instances, all down to the campaigning by the parents. If the parents of the other kids didn't take it up, well that's because they didn't want to or didn't know how.

For fast food try:

Chicken cottage on cowley road 

Proper meals try:

Bodrum 
Istanbul resturant
Nandos

* all of the above are on cowley road

A few classier restaurants around but I'm not too familiar with them.

Also you can, and indeed should, visit the ashmolean museum, as well as the pit rivers museum. The city centre is a nice place to hangout too. specially AMT cafe... opposite KFC on cornmarket street in the city centre.

We are not too far from central London, and it is quite cheap to get there via the Oxford tube. London central is stunning and amazing. I have lived in Oxford for well over 12 years and I still love Oxford/central london. 

The others will help more :D and I hope you enjoy your stay here and welcome. =]

Not only does he have to deal with not being a Time Lord anymore, he also has to fit himself into a universe where he has no roots, no connections anywhere.  He goes from having a network of companions who love him and would literally die for him, to knowing no one except for Rose and her family; from exploring all of time and space in his sentient timeship to trying to fit himself in around someone else's life.

Their relationship would be a total reversal of the entire paradigm they'd built up in their previous years of traveling together.  It would be the first time in centuries the Doctor would have had to interact with a companion completely on her terms rather than his own.  He'll walk into her apartment, hang up his jacket and put his bit of TARDIS on the mantelpiece, look around and realize that the only things he has in this universe are the clothes on his back, a TARDIS that might not grow until centuries beyond his human lifespan, and his relationship with Rose.

The tenth doctor is none too stable himself, but he admits that his metacrisis clone is an angrier, more vengeful version of himself, too dangerous to be left on his own.  So from here I can see it going a couple different ways.  Either he becomes controlling, trying to force himself and Rose into a relationship like they had on the TARDIS, where he does crazy dangerous stuff and she backs him up and tells him how awesome he is, or he just kind of withdraws entirely, locking himself into Rose's bedroom and living vicariously through bad sci-fi and trying to pretend he's still a Time Lord, he can still regenerate, that TARDIS is going to grow any day now and he can get back to his space adventures.  Either way would end up with Rose getting fed up and kicking him out.  Since Rose's father is the Bill Gates of the parallel universe, their breakup is horrifyingly public, the stuff that keeps tabloids afloat for years.

Cowley Road for cheap, varied food and alternative night life.  Also on the Cowley Road is the O2 Academy smallish music venue, check out who's playing, you may get lucky.  The O2 Academies are a string of venues, all the others of which are much larger, so the Oxford one tends to punch above its weight simply because a tour will schedule the other venues in the chain and add this one on.

For better, more formal food, try the Cherwell[2] Boathouse or the Magdalen[1] Arms.

That's what the missing piece is, IMO. Chelsea won the previous season in part because Malouda was in form and aggressive on the wing. He had 8 assists last season, but just 4 assists this season. I think for Chelsea to really improve, they need to go out and sign a winger.


If I really had to pick a handful of wingers that would definitely have an immediate impact on Chelsea next season, it would have to be a short list of Ashley Young, Aaron Lennon, and Samir Nasri.

Amy would find Rory's discomfort hilarious right up until she didn't, at which point she'd tell Jack in no uncertain terms to back the hell off of her man. And even an immortal omnisexual horndog is going to find angry Amy Pond a little frightening.

The Doctor would be conspicuously fiddling with the TARDIS the entire time, hoping like hell to avoid getting dragged into the conversation.

Later, Rory would die and Jack would revive him with his sparkly immortality powers (which can only be properly applied via thorough French kissing), after which Rory would relax enough to flirt back, utterly bemusing the Doctor and delighting Amy—right up until Rory (!) goes a little too far and she reminds him *exactly* to whom in this time-traveling police box he is married.

In my view Stardust is the closest in tone to the Doctor's Wife, while also being my favorite of his books. Here is a list of my favorites, with links to the Amazon pages, and favorite quotes from the books. (Yes, I am madly in love with Gaiman's works, why do you ask?).


1.) [Stardust](http://www.amazon.com/Stardust-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0061689246/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305843553&amp;sr=1-1) (made a movie of this one). This is the closest in flavor to The Doctor's Wife. 

&gt;Every lover is, in his heart, a madman, and, in his head, a minstrel."" 

&gt;""And then they were at Tristran's old home, where his sister waited for him, and there was a steaming breakfast on the stove and on the table, prepared for him, lovingly, by the woman he had always believed to be his mother."" 

2.) [Good Omens](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Omens-Accurate-Prophecies-Nutter/dp/0060853972/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305842877&amp;sr=1-1) (co-written with Terry Pratchett)

&gt;Most books on witchcraft will tell you that witches work naked. This is because most books on witchcraft were written by men."" 

&gt;""God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players [i.e. everybody], to being involved in an obscure and complex variant of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time."" 


3.) [Neverwhere](http://www.amazon.com/Neverwhere-Novel-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0060557818/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305842896&amp;sr=1-1)

&gt;""He had noticed that events were cowards: they didn't occur singly, but instead they would run in packs and leap out at him all at once.""

&gt;""You've a good heart. Sometimes that's enough to see you safe wherever you go. But mostly, it's not."" 

4.) [Anansi Boys](http://www.amazon.com/Anansi-Boys-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0060515198/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305842911&amp;sr=1-1)

&gt;""Each person who ever was or is or will be has a song. It isn't a song that anybody else wrote. It has its own melody, it has its own words. Very few people get to sing their song. Most of us fear that we cannot do it justice with our voices, or that our words are too foolish or too honest, or too odd. So people live their song instead."" 

&gt;""Some hats can only be worn if you're willing to be jaunty, to set them at an angle and to walk beneath them with a spring in your stride as if you're only a step away from dancing. They demand a lot of you."" 

5.) [American Gods](http://www.amazon.com/American-Gods-Novel-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0060558121/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305842925&amp;sr=1-1)

&gt;""The bird turned, head tipped, suspiciously, on one side, and it stared at him with bright eyes. 
""Say 'Nevermore,'"" said Shadow. 
""Fuck you,"" said the raven."" 

&gt;""All your questions can be answered, if that is what you want. But once you learn your answers, you can never unlearn them."" 

If we include his other work the [Sandman](http://www.amazon.com/Sandman-Vol-Preludes-Nocturnes-New/dp/1401225756/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305842949&amp;sr=1-1) comics would be ranked #3 on my list of Gaiman works. I'm not a huge fan of his children's work, but mostly that's because I'm not a fan of the genre.

true,holohedron,null,null,"&gt;Rail analyst Christian Wolmar says the high cost of Britain's railways is down to fragmentation.

&gt;He said when British Rail ran the railways it cost taxpayers ""around a billion pounds a year in today's money, now the railway with many more people on it, so it should be more efficient, is costing £5bn"". 

What kind of a ""rail analyst"" would say something so retarded? Do they really mean ""random train spotter we found at the end of a platform""?

British Rail may well have cost a fifth of the amount the railway costs today but that's because they were only just keeping the railway running. They could barely afford to invest anything in modernising the network and decades of underinvestment is the reason Network Rail is spending so much now. The answer isn't to spend less, the answer is to invest a sufficient amount of money over a suitable time scale to enable the railway to operate more efficiently. 

You can't just compare Britain's railway to that golden vision everyone has in their heads of a European railway. They're completely different systems that have a vastly different history of development and investment and serve different purposes, especially when you consider population density. Some small branch routes in European countries have terrible rolling stock and the lines themselves are slow and bumpy. If you take all 10 000 miles of the UK rail network into account it doesn't compare that badly.",0,1305847256,null,0,false,0,c1uzp2i,t3_hf48r,t1_c1uzp2i,t3_hf48r,1427163438,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"I love the stage management of it all; it is more a well rehearsed play than a debate. At first, there is a timid question about the rape topic. One would think that Clarke would address this, but queue a lovely softening up of the audience from Shami Chakrabarti, legitimising his comments. I think it was then Jack Straw who did the same, then to the protagonist himself who had very little to do to make up for his clumsy tongue.

Clarke's comments I found perfectly acceptable as part of open political discourse or debate. I found the acceleration from differentiating instances of rape to resignation, absurd. Now if the politician was wearing a yellow tie, I don't think Question Time would have played out so nicely.

The substance of the program I found tiresome; such comparatively unimportant subjects. Continuing the stage-management, we have a focus on the outrage surrounding the rape comments rather than the subject it self, and then the audience was busied with such trite bullshit regarding the maybe votes of prisoners. Rape is a serious issue, as is the right to vote, but both are covered in terms of the outrage. Rather than an insightful progression towards something that can meaningful address the apparent [85,000 females raped in 2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape#United_Kingdom). (If that is true than I am appalled.) The whole prisoners and punishment was covered on such a Victorian (almost religious, vengeful God you now you must burn in hell level), and I'll say nothing about the harpy from the Daily Mail.

Additionally, I think having Amy narrate it is sort of Amy serving her purpose -- the companions have always been something of audience surrogates, from a narration point of view: there because we all want to imagine travelling with the Doctor, because it gives someone for the Doctor to explain difficult concepts to in simple terms, and because it's generally perceived as harder for the audience to relate to -- and the authors to write about -- truly alien characters.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; In the eight months without cameras, there were 18 deaths on the roads in Oxfordshire, compared with 12 in the same period in the previous year. This was the first time in four years that the number of deaths on the county's roads had risen. Serious injuries rose from 160 to 179.

Meaningless without knowing the standard deviation of these measures. Of course the problem isn't residential speed cameras anyway. Put all the cameras you want in residential areas.

The bigger problem is mobile cameras policing accident hotspots like the A40 by Abergavenny. Possibly the straightest, flattest and most empty road in the nation. A real death trap.

I thought the Tories seemed to be cracking on to this. Deal with the people who speed in town and let us go faster on safer roads. Hell I'm amazed at the number of people who will do 40 in a national speed limit and then keep doing 40 in a 30. These people are the dangerous ones. Not the people who speed on good roads and then do not in residential areas.

&gt; A study for the Department for Transport, involving more rigorous scientific methods than those deployed by Thames Valley police in Oxfordshire, shows that 19% fewer people were killed or seriously injured at accident black spots after speed cameras were introduced, above and beyond the general decline in accidents on the roads.

Again nobody has a problem with this. The vast majority of cameras are not in accident hotspots. Cherry picking data isn't useful. You have to not only include blackspots but all cameras to judge the policy. At the moment the policy isn't to limit it to blackspots.

He cut out a long black strip of felt for the police box bar at the top then sewed it on with black thread then sewed the letters on in white. The windows were two rectangles of white felt sewn on with white thread and then the grid of the windows sewn on in blue. The little info panel was again a white rectangle sewn on with white thread but this time the writing was done in black and is just lines because it was too small for actual letters. Then he sewed the blue thread onto the case into the shape of the six panels, a line down the middle for the door and a border around the doors.

Its far from perfect as the panels are all wonky, the blue case is the wrong colour (he was going to paint it to TARDIS blue but I refused because I liked it as it was) and his sewing skills arent that good so the letter stitching is coming out and I'll have to redo it but I adore it, and I think it adds to the homemade charm of it.

Everyone checks their speedo. The ONLY time I check my speed is when there's a policeman/car about or a speed camera. 

That doesn't mean that I'm doing 70mph everywhere, it just means I'm driving at a speed I feel is appropriate for the road/conditions I'm driving in. 

And yes, sometimes that's 30mph or less. 

I'm a better driver when I don't have to worry about speed. I remember I was slightly speeding (Maybe 35-40 in a 30) and I saw some kids running down the pavement. They ran past a van but never came out the other side of it so I started breaking contemplating them running out from behind the van. (Idiot kids)

Sure enough, bam. They run into the [b]side[/b] of my car.. Has I been going slower originally they would have been in front of my car and had I actually been looking at my speedo I might not have seen the hazard develop.

Do you have any way to back this up? More importantly, do you have any way to back up the implied conclusion - that cameras do not prevent casualties. The article linked suggests some (limited) evidence that they do. Can you come up with figures to back up your point of even that (low) standard?

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; I remember I was slightly speeding (Maybe 35-40 in a 30) and I saw some kids running down the pavement.

But what if you hadn't seen the kids or contemplated the fact that they might run out?  What about all the drivers who aren't as diligent as you?  What about the people with poor eyesight who probably shouldn't be driving anyway?  Should they be allowed to go at 40mph?

Sooner or later, someone, perhaps you even, will have a child run or a drunk person stumble in front of their car.

At 20mph they'll probably live.  At 40 mph they probably won't.  In fact, the mortality rate at 40mph is roughly **four times** that at 20mph [[source](http://www.science.org.au/nova/058/058key.htm)].

See, the human body has evolved to survive the kind of impact that happens when you run as fast as you can (chasing a wooly mammoth, or whatever), trip up and fall flat on your face on something hard.  That's roughly equivalent to a car hitting you at 20mph.  You might break a few bones, lose some skin, or at the very least have some nasty bruises, but you'll live.  Probably.

Human bodies *aren't* built to survive the impact of a car hitting you at 40mph.  It's a simple as that.  No need to evolve protection against something that doesn't happen that often.  Gives us another few millions years and perhaps we'll have evolved body armour.  But for now, please spare a thought for the soft squishy things that your car can fuck up big time.

By all means go as fast as you like on the motorway (as long as you're a reasonable distance from the car in front, of course).

If you're lucky you'll meet a grad student to get you into their lounge which happens to be Albert Einstein's old room. You can also see the actual inspiration for Alice and Wonderland rabbit hole and tree there.  

Next I would go to the University Church at go up the tower.  It's the best view of the entire city and you'll get lovely pictures of the Radcliff Camera and gorgeous dreaming spires of the buildings.  2-3 pound entry.

The Natural History and Pitt Rivers Museum- where you can see actual shrunken heads and other amazing stuff.  Plus, it's free.

If you're a foodie, then check out Jamie Oliver's restaurant in Oxford. I believe it was his first.  For good food, here are a couple of places to eat: Red Lion, Sojo, Fishes Gastro Pub, Angrid Thai.

I would check out Jericho Tavern and the Jericho area.  Lots of famous bands have played at this place.

Summer wine cafe is also lots of fun, especially when they have their free monthly tasting night.

Taking a walk along the river in the Port Meadow is fantastic! You'll see horses and cows are roaming free. While you're there you can stop by the Medley Manor Farm and go berry picking.  You can also hire a boat and go up and down the river with a bottle of pimms (which is very british).

By Magdalen (another of the many colleges of Oxford Uni) are punting boats.  I would make a few sandwiches and go punting up and down the river.

If you have time, you can also take a bus from the Gloucester Green Bus Station to Cambridge (another famous university town). Blenheim palace is spectacular and something not to miss.  You can easily get there by taking a bus from the Gloucester Green station.

From the Oxford train station you can easily go to London or Stratford upon Avon (the home of Shakespeare).

If you're interested in attending a lecture in oxford (and sometimes with famous people), see the interesting talks oxford group on facebook at https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_352839028308 

Lastly, you can rent a car cheaply from enterprise and go see Stonehenge.   It's about an hour and a half drive away.

I definitely side with my line manager on that one... 

It's sad that children can be born today and still end up living a life completely segregated from the other side of the community. 

I also think it's sad that the only political party actively supporting the integration of schools is the Alliance party. All the other parties *say* they are cross-community but I think the Alliance party is the only one that can back it up in any way.

In nineteen eighty-eight, Professor Ray Budde, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst called for educational reform by establishing “charter schools” or as you know them in the United Kingdom, free schools. Three years later, Minnesota passed the nation’s first charter school law, and a year after that California followed. Now forty states and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have charter school laws resulting in over five thousand charter schools.

I *do not*, however, want this to be your idea of charter schools. Among the schools I visited was a nationally acclaimed school that made No. 1 one Newsweek's top high schools. The academics are TOP NOTCH. Teachers are Ivy League (Harvard, Yale, Etc.) educated. Although I did not chose this school due to the excessive homework assigned, I have great respect for the founders, who were fed up with the state's horrid education system. Among the personal supporters of this school are former Fortune 500 CEOS and U.S. Ambassadors. 

Then, there's the final type of charter school: the one that is created by a philanthropist to help kids in need. This is best evidenced by KIPP schools, which gave great promise to its attendants whom otherwise would have been living in poverty later in their life. As with all U.S. charter schools, under law, the schools must randomly select who is accepted, so getting into one of these schools can be a difficult, but life changing experience.

As for your last question, the setup is *very* similar, with the exception that the British schools can have a religious affiliation. ",0,1305920370,null,0,false,0,c1v5518,t3_hfmk9,t1_c1v5518,t1_c1v20j6,1427166069,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

""Shortly after midnight on the morning of 10 June 1886, a series of more than 30 increasingly strong earthquakes were felt in the Rotorua area and an unusual sheet lightning display was observed from the direction of Tarawera. At around 2:00 am a larger earthquake was felt and followed by the sound of an explosion. By 2:30 am Mount Tarawera's three peaks had erupted, blasting three distinct columns of smoke and ash thousands of metres into the sky. At around 3.30 am, the largest phase of the eruption commenced; vents at Rotomahana produced a pyroclastic surge that destroyed several villages within a 6 kilometre radius"", including Te Wairoa (where Europeans and Maori settled before sailling over to the tourist area), buried and since excavated.

The [Pink and White Terraces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_and_White_Terraces) (sometimes dubbed The Eighth Wonder of the World - [picture](http://www.prints.co.nz/Merchant2/graphics/00000001/D26_The_Pink_and_White_Terraces_Hoyte_J_C_.jpg)) were almost completely destroyed by the eruption - a portion of the lower tiers were discovered only in 2011.

However, one of the interesting-good-for-TV parts of this tale is that of the phantom canoe. Eleven days before the eruption, a boat full of tourists returning from the Terraces saw what appeared to be a war canoe approach their boat, only to disappear in the mist half a mile from them. Nobody around the lake owned such a war canoe, and nothing like it had been seen on the lake for many years.

Maori elders at Te Wairoa claimed that it was a waka wairua (spirit canoe) and was a portent of doom.

I'd like to see the Doctor be a part of that tale - it's a beautiful and fascinating area.

true,heavymetalengineer,null,null,"I don't know, from what I was aware of, going to a catholic school had nothing to do with not being around the ""other side"", it was to get an education which included catholic values and catholic teachings. I had plenty of friends from catholic and protestant backgrounds as I grew up in a mixed neighbourhood before I went to a catholic school. 

Although this is something I do not know a huge amount about, I don't think you can equate catholic school to sectarianism as it is more about religious education than a republican/loyalist thing. There's no point saying that integrated school are what's best when really they're not what everyone wants. 

I think like a lot of things, responsibility is being shifted on to the schools, rather than at home. I knew protestant and indian kids growing up because of where my parents decided we should live. And I knew that although these people may look different or have different beliefs that was fine and there was nothing wrong with them because my parents made it a point to emphasise this and communicate to me early on that treating people differently for any reason is wrong. 

Northern Ireland is often described as divided, but I think that's wrong. Most people work and deal with ""people who kick with the other foot every"" day and have no problem. In my opinion the problem lies with kids who from a young age are told not to go across that street, cos ""themuns"" live over there and you don't want to socialise with ""themuns"".

Either way, it was good. I'm kind of torn between the common sense argument (integration is good) and practical issues (teenage boys are skirt watchers and would not work in fully integrated/mixed school). I would speculate that all boy integrated (all religions) schools would be more hostile than fully integrated mixed (boys and girls) schools. I believe in integration but most boys would get distracted. Girls, not so much I imagine.

However, there'll probably be a big blob in the middle where their timeline gets all mucked up. That'll probably happen whenever the Doctor actually gets his own diary. River probably knows that before the Doctor carries around a diary of his own, he meets her in exactly the opposite order. 

As far as Silence in the Library, I'm thinking that the future Doctor pops back to hang out with her the day before she dies. Of course, she wouldn't know this yet since it hasn't happened to her. That's why she keeps thinking that things are going to be linear from here on out.

My point was that he can probably give himself two of those.  The machine we are talking about rewrote his body completely and then created the watch as the backup of him.  he doesn't need a backup because he doesn't need to rewrite his mind or memories. So if he could make that machine, and then modify it to just do the physical changes, he could have a time lords body with time lord genetics etc.. again.  At that point, even if he isn't immortal he is suddenly very long lived.

As for the rest of it, no one should know better than the Doctor what it is that makes a time lord out of a standard gallifriean.. there is probably some way he can do it to himself again.

If you don't want to do that, start with Matt Smith's first episodes. Then, before you watch Flesh and Stone/The Time of Angels, go back to Series 3 (David Tennant/Freema Agyeman) and watch ""Blink,"" to get the intro to the Weeping Angels and to watch a really awesome and really scary episode, and watch ""Silence in the Library"" and ""Forest of the Dead"" from Series 4 (David Tennant/Catherine Tate) to get your intro to River Song. It's not quite as good as Blink, but it's pretty scary, and I really like River, but she's pretty divisive. At this point you'll be ready to finish out Series 5 and start on Series 6. If you want a taste of Christopher Eccleston (and you do), the two must-see stories from his era (three episodes, since one's a two-parter) are ""Dalek"" and ""The Empty Child""/""The Doctor Dances."" Dalek has the introduction of the Daleks, which it will help a little to see before ""Victory of the Daleks"" (although it's not strictly necessary), plus it's really good. ""The Empty Child""/""The Doctor Dances"" doesn't really introduce anything necessary to understanding the current series, but it's really, really, really, really good.

&gt;Why don't the checkers make eye contact?
&gt;Why don't the checkers speak to any customers?
&gt;Why do the checkers take for-fucking-ever to scan every item?

Because they are either grumpy teenagers or obese recently divorced women in their 50s. You're either being served by someone who is just grinding out the hours to get money for pot and booze, or someone who the government has forced off unemployment for the first time in 20 years.

&gt;Why do the checkers just throw all my items in a fucking pile on top of the bags without even the slightest effort to fucking bag things?

Bagging isn't the job of the checker, if you need help bagging things(Eg. You are old) then you can call for assistance. If being a checker required moving from the chair and helping people the number of applications would fall 10 fold.

&gt;Why am i given one bag for eighty items?

We're trying to be ""Eco-Friendly"", they expect you to keep the bags and bring them back each time for reuse. 

&gt;Why are the bananas always lime green?

When you buy yellow bananas they will go brown in a few days, green ones last younger before they go old and mushy.

&gt;Why are the apples always mushy?

You are probably buying a soft kind of apple, or one that has been dropped on the floor.

&gt;Why isn't there any consistency in the items carried?

Because if they overstock on cheese ones then they need to be sold. By only putting out cheese ones then people *have* to buy them.

&gt;Why-oh-why doesn't any Tesco employee make the slightest effort to be helpful, friendly, or polite? I understand that it probably is a shitty job and, furthermore, as a poor immigrant i really don't have any choice but to continue shopping at Tesco because i can't afford Waitrose, but my daily Tesco run makes me consider starvation rather than having to deal with this shitty corporation.

Yes they are very well free to move into high tech design and infact this is what China is currently doing. This pretty much means their wages won't be half of yours and infact China will see a overall wage increase.

So what do you want UK to do? What should UK produce if not high tech?

Lower *real* (in world exchange-rate terms) wages is what I meant. In real terms, therefore, import goods become relatively more expensive.

And yes, this can be with a Chinese wage increase as you say - that's why I specifically mentioned real wages.

I'm not saying that we shouldn't produce high-tech goods, but that the East is doing the same and we will not be competitive until there is less of a wage discrepancy. This will be forced upon us over the next decade or longer.

You obvoiusly live your own lives by the same standards therefore are trying to excuse this as perfectly ok type of thing to do. NOT SO - by the profession that these so called ""teachers"" have undertaken they are at ALL TIMES in Parentis Locus of these children and It is by their examples that these children will grow up and follow. Sadly they will now believe that this type of behaviour is acceptable. WELL NEWSFLASH IT IS NOT!! Obviously it is also NOT YOUR children that are being taught the moral lessons of life by these so called ""teachers""! WHO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SET EXAMPLES TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION.


Hmmmmmmm.

&gt;Next time someone asks me why I send my daugther to a private school instead of one of the state schools here in Milton Keynes I will show them this article. Teachers should be role models for the children and this sort of behaviour is unacceptable whether or not it happens out of school hours.

Interesting reasons why people are against it...

&gt;If I was a parent with children at this school I would be looking very hard at the qualifications and grades these women have attained with the view to publishing them next to their photographs. What parent wants drunks who slide down poles wearing skimpy underwear to teach their children? It says a lot about the head teacher who can't see anything wrong with such behaviour. Welcome to the feminised world of education.

Young people in Northern Ireland have extremely narrow mindsets because they don't have the opportunities to be in contact with other people in their communities. 

It's wrong and most other societies in the West do not divide schools up like we do. It's stupid. 

&gt; In my opinion the problem lies with kids who from a young age are told not to go across that street, cos ""themuns"" live over there and you don't want to socialise with ""themuns"". How you would fix this problem though, I have no idea.

You fix it by allowing young people to mix by promoting integrated schools!! Simple! 

If a child is sent to an all Catholic/Protestant school, what other opportunities will they have to mix with people from the other side? You can't expect the parents to be able to do much here considering how divided most neighbourhoods are. 

Another problem is for those parents who aren't Christian. Where do they send their kids? There's far too little integrated schools to cater for this. 

I went to a Catholic grammar school myself. If only for some cross-community youth groups I attended, I would have only had one single opportunity to meet someone from the other side of the community. One single few hour session classes at third year were invited to meet with young people from a predominantly Protestant school  . That single few hour period was definitely not enough to shake off sectarian mindsets for most people. 

The only opportunity most people have is through university, but that's too late. And many young people never make it to university. And even at the universities in Northern Ireland, you sometimes see the Catholic and Protestant students living and studying separately (Catholics in the Holylands, Protestants on the Lisburn road etc.). 

It's incredibly backwards to be promoting segregated schools in this day and age. ",0,1305989629,null,0,true,0,c1v96if,t3_hfsyl,t1_c1v96if,t1_c1v6g6n,1427167973,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

How about the fact that Facebook were legally permitted to use any photos as they please until public pressure led them to remove it?

IMO, everything should default to completely private unless you tell it otherwise, with a clear request for privacy settings.

My first idea of the Doctor getting killed was that he was a ""clone"", and I use the term clone loosely, seeing as we knew we would be dealing with them at some point during the series, and I had assumed that the ""clone"" was left to run free for a few hundred years knowing at some point he would have to give up his life.

Though him being a ""clone"" of the original doesn't explain why Canton would be there, and why it would be that time period that lead into the impossible astronaut which is why I assumed this won't explain the Doctor getting killed because it feels like there needs to be more going on that just a clone.

To quote the [Tardis Index File article about the Doctor's Age](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Doctor%27s_age)

&gt;**Third Doctor**           
&gt;This incarnation of the Doctor started to say that he had been a scientist for ""several thousand"" years, but stopped himself before completing the sentence. (DW: The Mind of Evil) He had made a similar age reference shortly before that incident. 
               
&gt;**Fourth Doctor**            
&gt;It would seem that the Fourth Doctor would have been 748 at the time of his regeneration. (DW: Planet of the Spiders) This incarnation of the Doctor consistently described himself as around 750.

&gt;**Sixth Doctor**            
&gt;The Doctor described himself as 900 years old (DW: Revelation of the Daleks) and later stated his age as ""900 years, more or less"". 

&gt;**Seventh Doctor**            
&gt;Hours after his regeneration, the Doctor unlocked a door in the Rani's laboratory with the numerical code ""953,"" which he stated was both his age and the Rani's. (DW: Time and the Rani)
            
&gt;The Doctor spent unspecified millions of years in a coma, frozen in a block of ice. (BFA: Frozen Time)

&gt;By the time of his next regeneration, he had aged visibly. (DW: Doctor Who)

&gt;By his own estimate afterward he would have been 1009 when he regenerated, though he admitted he may have lost count at some point. (EDA: Vampire Science) 

&gt;**Eighth Doctor**            
&gt;Three years after his regeneration, the Doctor calculated his total age to be 1012, making him 1009 when he regenerated. He admitted that he was unsure, however, as there was a question of whether he lost count. 

&gt;The Doctor aged while trapped as an amnesiac on Earth in ""real time"" between the late 19th century (EDA: The Ancestor Cell) and the year 2001, making him at least 1125 by the time this crisis was over. (EDA: Escape Velocity)

&gt;At one point while traveling with Lucie Miller, the Doctor spent 600 years on the planet Orbis. He later mentioned that he rounded and adjusted his age based on different year lengths in different parts of the universe. (BFA: Orbis) For this reason he preferred to simply start counting at his most recent regeneration, giving his age as ""three."" (EDA: Vampire Science) 

&gt;**Ninth Doctor**            
&gt;This incarnation claimed ""900 years of time and space"", i.e. travel in his TARDIS, and when asked, said that this was his age

&gt;**The ""900"" Controversy**            
&gt;The decision by the writers of the 2005 revival of the series to explicitly describe the Doctor as 900 years old, despite evidence to the contrary on TV and expanded media, is one of the few notable contradictions to established canon in the revival. Although as noted above it's possible to suggest rationalisations (and fans have suggested others ranging from Time War-related trauma to speculation of an unchronicled adventure in which the Doctor was ""de-aged"" much as he was ""aged"" in DW: The Sound of Drums and Last of the Time Lords), to date no episode, novel or comic strip has attempted to address the discrepancy. One simple explaination would be that the Doctor has, simply, taken to lying about his age (precedent for this exists in DW: The Ribos Operation in which Romana catches the Doctor shaving a few years off his age - something she, herself, apparently does after her first regeneration). Another is that his measurements of years might vary based on which planet he's using as a baseline; a year on Gallifrey is unlikely to be the same as a year on Earth. Another may be that he has come to base his age off the time he has spent travelling in the TARDIS. 

&gt;**""He Has No Clue""**            
&gt;A simpler and even more self-evident theory is that the Doctor doesn't really know how old he actually is, as constantly traveling backward and forward through time could make it very difficult to measure one's lifespan at all. This theory has been fanon, and the Doctor occasionally admitted to being unsure of his age in spinoff media. (DWM: The Time Witch, EDA: Vampire Science)

&gt;This is the theory subscribed to by Doctor Who's current executive producer and head writer Steven Moffat, as stated in an interview with SFX Magazine:             

&gt;*"" The thing I keep banging on about is that he doesn't know what age he is. He's lying. How could he know, unless he's marking it on a wall? He could be 8,000 years old, he could be a million. He has no clue. The calendar will give him no clues.""*

true,KoNP,silence,Silence,"I agree. The ""speculation"" in this thread is making my head hurt. I'm a fan of speculation, don't get me wrong. But rampant wild-mass-guessing that draws connections that aren't there, completely ignores logic and storywriting conventions, and that treats Occam's razor as an inconvenience annoys the piss out of me.

You know what the deal is with the deck of cards? They didn't pay attention to which cards they used to build it with. That's it. They shot all the scenes from angle X in one take with half the dialog, and then they did the same for angle Y with the other half, and then they cut them together. That's how film-making works, they don't film it as it's eventually shown.

Houses of cards are unstable. A puff of wind or a vibration on the surface it's standing on can take the whole thing down, easily. The house of cards in question probably fell over a few times and needed to be rebuilt. If they shot part of the same scene on a different day, as they more than likely would have, then they would have had to rebuild it yet again. Now, do you honestly think the DoP and the episode director/writer got an assistant to write down the suit, colour and position of each of the constituent cards, to make sure things were ""consistent""?

No. Of course not. That's an unneeded expense and delay, especially when you factor in that they're not expecting to have to deal with thousands of insane, rampantly-mass-speculating fans that have forgotten all notion of critical thinking.

The Doctor was staring down **the deck of cards itself**, not the ones on the top. Look at his eyelines, he's looking clear into the middle row. The house of cards was the weird thing, not the two on top. As for ""but he did that thing and it **_MEEEAAANNNNNS SOMETHING!!!!_**"", he's The fuckmothering DOCTOR. That's WHAT HE DOES.

Traditionally television news fulfilled the role of straightforward reporting of events, they dealt with the facts. Newspapers however, were traditionally responsible for analysis and debate of news items which was why people bought them, to gain a better understanding of a story or public issue. Lately however, television news has sought to explain stories as well as present the facts, through punditry such as Press Preview on Sky News or Jeff Randall Live for example. This trend is mainly to do with the need for more content in a 24 hour news channel environment because in all honesty not that much actually happens in a day so you have to fill in the time with something.

Something that bothers me slightly is the obsession with people seeking an unbiased news source. Yes, it's nice to have in the form of the BBC (well it's close) but what I fail to understand is why people feel unintelligent enough that they can't read a non-objective source and work out what to believe for themselves. Have we really dumbed down as a society that much?
