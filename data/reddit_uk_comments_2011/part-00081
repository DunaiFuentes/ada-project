It really depends on who you are what you like. Brighton generally caters to young and alternative kinds of people. But there are much more mainstream bars around if that's your bag. If you want to go to a club you will 100% have to get tickets and be prepared to queue on what is most likely going to be a rainy and windy night.

My advice is to walk around the lanes and find a pub you like the look of and just stay there. 

I would recommend The Black Lion, The Eagle and Child, The Fishbowl, The Office. All nice and lively bars with good music and staff. But basically any pub that you find will be good on nye in brighton. All of these pubs are situated in and around the lanes. I would advise against venturing out of this 'district'.

*Do you feel that Received Pronunciation provides a proper standard of English pronunciation (for educational and institutional purposes)? Does it properly reflect the average, most widely understood form of English?* No, I think RP reinforces class divisions and stereotypes. The BBC have dropped it in favour of regional accents. Among the general population there is an amount of 'reverse-snobbery' directed at those who speak in this way.

*Are you familiar with Estuary English? (If not: click)* Yes

*Have you noticed any qualities of Estuary English (see wiki) in your area? (I'm told that Estuary English is becoming more widespread, so I basically want to know if you have noticed any of that.)* No

*What area are you from?* County Durham

*Do you feel that the widespread qualities of Estuary English should be reflected in the ‘standard’ pronunciation? (As in: should RP be changed to reflect changes in common pronunciation or should we attempt to uphold the old standard and try to keep away intrusive qualities such as the ones that distinguish Estuary English from RP?)* Absolutely not. There should be no such thing as a standardised English accent. The great thing about the UK is that you can travel just a few miles and find a totally different accent and dialect. Why should one, Estuary English, be singled out as the defining and standard accent? RP should not exist in any form.

*Do you think that the ‘standard’ pronunciation has changed in your lifetime? What changed?* RP hasn't changed. What other ""standard"" is there?

Yes I am familiar with RP. It's not heard much up north. I don't see it as a standard for proper pronunciation, I just see it as another way of speaking. It's still possible to pronounce words correctly and speak clearly while having a regional accent. RP makes me think of posh people, but some of those people are still utterly indecipherable. RP to me, is what the very old BBC broadcasts used to sound like before they let people with accents on television.

I am from Manchester, and have always lived pretty much in the city centre. There are variances in accents even within Greater Manchester. I can hear differences between Central, Salford, Bury, Oldham etc. Ive been told I sound like Christopher Ecclestone by some people, and like Noel Gallagher from others. Im probably somewhere in between.

I am familiar with estuary. It seems to be increasingly prevalent around university students. Such as when people pronounce bath or grass as ""barth"" and ""grarse"" with an elongated A. For me its a short A, like in ""cat.""
A good example is when an estuary speaker says Bus, Bass or Boss it sounds the same to me. But when I say them, each vowel has a distinctly different sound.

When you say should RP be changed to reflect this, I think no. Its not like you can all take a vote to change an accent. Accents evolve and change over time.

I cant think of any examples of how standard pronunciation has changed in my lifetime. Could you pose an example of what you mean?

Learning to pronounce words correctly and clearly is not a bad thing, but there is no reason why somebody cannot maintain an accent while doing so.

Accents can and do effect judegment sometimes yes. For example I dislike the accent of Birmingham and cannot take brummies seriously. I also dislike the sound of many the typical southern accents, as well as the squeaky kind of scousers (Liverpool). It doesnt mean I dislike the person, just the accent! Haha.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"1) It's no more ""proper"" than any other, but I would think it's easier to understand than some accents for someone who's not a native English speaker.

2) Originally, Home Counties, so I speak ""generalised Southern English"", but I've been away from the UK for long enough that my accent is often mistaken these days - some call it mid-Atlantic, though native British English speakers readily identify it as British English.

3) I'd heard the term and I could've guessed at what it was, but I checked anyway (your link is broken by the way).  Before I left I probably spoke a mixture of this and received pronunciation, though I couldn't say if it was spreading currently as it's more than a decade since I left.  Having said that, received pronunciation had been waning for some considerable time even before I left - let's face it, you won't find a great deal of it on the BBC any more...

3) I've no strong feelings on RP versus Estuary English, though the latter is far more ""typical"" of the largest group of British English speakers these days.  British English is a living language, its nature is to evolve and I see no value in trying to prevent this generally.  The only areas in which I'm a bit of a language Nazi are where changes reduce clarity of thought or introduce ambiguities (so, for example, I don't like the US expression ""I could care less"", especially in written form where the sarcasm is missing and the literal meaning is therefore the reverse of that intended).

4) Yes, see above.  RP is increasingly viewed as a ""posh"" dialect, and Generalised Southern and Estuary English are replacing it in the South East.  Obviously, new vocabulary comes in all the time, new slang, technical words, evolutions in meaning (presently is hardly ever used in its original sense to mean now any more for example), regional slang moves around the country much faster, etc.

5) Should regional variations be _allowed_ to continue to exist?!  God, yes!  We devolving not centralising, and that's a good thing.  Who has the authority to tell us what the correct accent is any more?  Variety is the spice of life and all that.  So long as we can understand each other (which we can most of the time!), more power to regional accents.  Having said that, it's clear that the English as a world language is evolving in so many different ways, we'll have a huge variety of almost different languages under the general name English eventually.  Against that you have the overwhelming influence of US culture which is pulling all varieties of English in a unifying direction...  So, who knows?

6) Do accents influence how you see people?  I'd be a liar if I said not.  I distinguish more exotic regional accents less than those of the South East where I can instantly place most people roughly into a class slot, but that probably says more about where I come from.  I imagine a Scot would be able to place Scottish accents better, a Mancunian Manchester accents, etc.  Possessing a regional accent generally just places a person geographically for me, though obviously I'm not not oblivious of the regional stereotypes and I'm probably not unaffected by them to some degree.",0,1322959434,null,0,true,0,c3512qm,t3_mz6h6,t1_c3512qm,t3_mz6h6,1427968946,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Anyway, when talking about RP, from my perspective anyway, I guess it's really about second language acquisition. So that's also what spawned the question whether or not standard pronunciation, in this case RP, should be changed. It's not so much about everyone in Britain speaking RP (although it might be in terms of education/government, but your stance is quite clear on that), but more so about having a standard to teach. So really my question was whether the standard pronunciation that is being taught to foreigners should change when the most widespread qualities of pronunciation change. (I'm sorry, this was not clear from the question itself)

**Do you feel that Received Pronunciation provides a proper standard of English pronunciation (for educational and institutional purposes)? Does it properly reflect the average, most widely understood form of English?** In a way, it does, there is an emphasis on clarity, which is good if you're teaching English I suppose. When I learnt German I was taught how to speak in a more Northern (generally considered more posh) accent. It doesn't probably reflect the majority of English speakers over here though.

**Are you familiar with Estuary English? (If not: click)** Yep.

**Have you noticed any qualities of Estuary English (see wiki) in your area? (I'm told that Estuary English is becoming more widespread, so I basically want to know if you have noticed any of that.)** Certainly there are now more glottal stops. And perhaps more question words added to sentences (init dough?) but that's the extent of it (init dough?)

**What area are you from?** FUCKING MERSEYSIDE

**Do you feel that the widespread qualities of Estuary English should be reflected in the ‘standard’ pronunciation? (As in: should RP be changed to reflect changes in common pronunciation or should we attempt to uphold the old standard and try to keep away intrusive qualities such as the ones that distinguish Estuary English from RP?)** No, it can't be enforced. Written rules can be enforced, (see Germany circa 1998 with the Rechtschreibungsreform) but not the way the language is *spoken*.

**Do you think that the ‘standard’ pronunciation has changed in your lifetime? What changed?** I have no idea ... sometimes in Liverpool you still get people pronouncing t's softer, like an Irishman, but most of the time it's missed out completely. I don't know if that counts, cos that might just have been a Catholic/Protestant thing.

**Do you see a standard for pronunciation as a good thing, or should regional qualities be maintained / allowed to exist? (in schools/government/etc.)?** Let's face it, the Scouse accent makes you sound dodgy. So if you want to be a successful Liverpudlian you need to change anyway. Other accents not so much - except Brummie. Let it be, that's what I would say. We don't live in the 30s, we don't need any homogenised accent to keep a stiff upper lip to.

When talking about standard pronunciation changing I guess I'm really talking about things like the BBC moving away from the RP pronunciation, or the queen slightly changing her accent in her speeches over the years (I heard something about this happening, not sure if it's true). I guess it becomes unclear because I'm talking about standards, but that is because to me RP is taught as a standard while in reality such a standard does not exist.

That's also the point of changing RP to reflect changing qualities, although I guess I really shouldn't be using RP and 'standard pronunciation' interchangeably. The point is more that if RP is deemed to be the most widely understood accent it might need to change with the times every once in a while, so if qualities from, for example, Estuary English are becoming increasingly more prevalent should RP, or at least the accent that we teach in foreign schools, change to properly reflect those qualities. The idea being to avoid RP pronunciation becoming increasingly disconnected from what is actually spoken.

true,Whisky_Drunk,manchester,Manchester,"I think the BBC moving away from RP is a good thing yes. As long as the speaker is clear and understood I see no problem. Ive not noticed any change with the queen though. You are right about there no being a standard though, but I suppose when learning English as a foreign language RP might be a good place to start. Just be prepared to adjust to some changes when moving around the country. I have a friend from Spain who learnt English as RP. She quickly adjusted to Manchester, but then she went to Newcastle and her confusion was hilarious.

I suppose it should be a 'generalised English' that should be taught.

Yet, there have been a number of studies such as those conducted by Fatima Mernissi on the variety of conditions under which a Muslim woman will voluntarily choose to wear 'the veil'. 
One particular example where women were and are choosing to wear the veil is Iran. Another slightly different example is that of Turkey where many women are being forced to unveil if they wish to attend university thus creating a politicised desire and by extension an affirmation of religion amongst women so affected to wear the veil. 
Not all Islamic countries require women to wear a full facial covering it is true, for some it is only required that the hair and rest of the body must be covered as in Iran before the revolution and to some extent immediately after.
It is a nuanced issue and one where no definitive answer is possible. Yet, for Britain to attempt to 'Ban the Burqa' is not really an option, the logistics of such a move are almost insurmountable not to mention the potential political backlash.

true,ebonycurtains,null,null,"Are you familiar with RP (a.k.a. BBC / The Queen’s English )? 

I'd guess this is close to my own accent. I'm from the north but just sound 'posh' to other northerners; I'm currently at uni with a lot of southerners and few can tell I'm northern.

Do you feel that Received Pronunciation provides a proper standard of English pronunciation (for educational and institutional purposes)? Does it properly reflect the average, most widely understood form of English? 

Most widely understood, maybe, because often foreigners and those from different regions may not fully understand some regional accents. I don't think it properly reflects the average Englishman's accent though; it does sound posh when many have regional accents.

Are you familiar with Estuary English? (If not: click) Yes.

Have you noticed any qualities of Estuary English (see wiki) in your area? (I'm told that Estuary English is becoming more widespread, so I basically want to know if you have noticed any of that.) 

Definitely, since I am a student at a northern university (Durham) where many students are from the south. I hear southern accents most of the time. Among the local population of the town, though, not at all.

What area are you from? Originally from Leeds, now living in Durham.

Do you feel that the widespread qualities of Estuary English should be reflected in the ‘standard’ pronunciation? (As in: should RP be changed to reflect changes in common pronunciation or should we attempt to uphold the old standard and try to keep away intrusive qualities such as the ones that distinguish Estuary English from RP?) 

No, I don't think we should hold London accents up as the 'standard' English accent when there are so many others.

Do you think that the ‘standard’ pronunciation has changed in your lifetime? What changed?

 I'm only 19, so I don't think so. I do know that my grandmother has a very different way of speaking from me, though she has lived in Leeds for most if not all of her life, so perhaps RP has changed over time.

Do you see a standard for pronunciation as a good thing, or should regional qualities be maintained / allowed to exist? (in schools/government/etc.)?

 I think it's useful to have a 'plain English' accent perhaps in media since regional accents, especially the stronger ones, can be hard to understand. However, regional accents should definitely be allowed to exist and nobody with a regional accent should be excluded from the public eye for this reason alone.",0,1322966470,null,0,false,0,c351xam,t3_mz6h6,t1_c351xam,t3_mz6h6,1427969338,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

A better way to get around the problem of driver inexperience at night is to have a tuition log-book style approach to driving lessons and require that before doing a test a driver can prove having a certain number of hours or miles of night-time driving, likewise A-roads. 

For motorways I don't see why they couldn't be a post-passing part of the tuition process;  you do your basic driving lessons, pass your test, and then you can't drive on the motorway until you've done a couple of top-up lessons with your driving instructor. They then sign off on the paperwork to confirm you are confident enough to drive by yourself on motorways and the motorway restriction is removed - no need to go back for a supplementary test.

For example, during that early scare in teh game when Morrison broke through, that was actually Kompany's fault.  If you notice, Kompany had come deep into NOrwich's half, and was lackadaiscally jogging back and Kolo was left alone to cover Morrison.  Just by the time, the camera panned back to the ball, it seemed as if Kolo messed up...I'm more inclined to blame Kompany.

I think you're all being very harsh on Kolo.  I personally rate him higher than Lescott, and often he's left cleaning up after others (Kompany in this case) so you're led to thinkt hat ti was his fault.

I think give him a little more match-time and you'll be seeing the old Kolo once more.

Personally I think Kompany had a relatively poor game today; his mistakes made Kolo look at fault...he just wasn't all that sharp and gave a corner away that led to teh goal.

Do you feel that Received Pronunciation provides a proper standard of English pronunciation (for educational and institutional purposes)? Does it properly reflect the average, most widely understood form of English?
It reflects the English expected most by those viewing British media (those overseas). How that professor Brian Cox got any gig talking on the BBC shocks me, his twang is abhorrent. 

What area are you from? Grew up in the midlands, live in Liverpool.

How would you describe your own accent? Was it always like that or was your accent different before? My accent has changed, when I ever go back to Coventry I get told of for speaking too fast and for using words they have never heard before like devod instead of devastated. 

Are you familiar with Estuary English? (If not: click) Yes

Have you noticed any qualities of Estuary English (see wiki) in your area? (I'm told that Estuary English is becoming more widespread, so I basically want to know if you have noticed any of that.)
I think it's all to do with the media you watch, children who sit infront of CBBC will develop esturary accents as that is what is infront of them. Those who spend hours sitting in the pub with their parents will have a more local accent.
Do you feel that the widespread qualities of Estuary English should be reflected in the ‘standard’ pronunciation? (As in: should RP be changed to reflect changes in common pronunciation or should we attempt to uphold the old standard and try to keep away intrusive qualities such as the ones that distinguish Estuary English from RP?)
Esturary English should be put in the bin.

Do you think that the ‘standard’ pronunciation has changed in your lifetime? What changed?
Only words like iraq, irak, irrrack and god knows how many other pronounciations of it. Again it's all the media.

Do you see a standard for pronunciation as a good thing, or should regional qualities be maintained / allowed to exist? (in schools/government/etc.)?
Deffo have regionalism. Make sure the mancs do pick how the scousers sound though. In liverpool alone, you can travel as little as 2 miles and hear very different accents.

**Do you feel that Received Pronunciation provides a proper standard of English pronunciation (for educational and institutional purposes)?**

I think it is the standard when learning the language, because it is how English 'should' be spoken if you want to pronounce every word properly.

**Does it properly reflect the average, most widely understood form of English?**

No, because their are lots of different accents all over the place

**What area are you from?**

Surrey

**How would you describe your own accent? Was it always like that or was your accent different before?**

I'm not too sure, quite a few people have remarked that I sound posh, especially those pesky northerners. I blame that on the fact I went to a private school at a young age. I notice when people pronounce words like 'water' without the 't'.


**Are you familiar with Estuary English? (If not: click)
Have you noticed any qualities of Estuary English (see wiki) in your area? (I'm told that Estuary English is becoming more widespread, so I basically want to know if you have noticed any of that.)**

Yeah, a lot of people I know speak in a similar way, especially chavs.

**Do you feel that the widespread qualities of Estuary English should be reflected in the ‘standard’ pronunciation? (As in: should RP be changed to reflect changes in common pronunciation or should we attempt to uphold the old standard and try to keep away intrusive qualities such as the ones that distinguish Estuary English from RP?)**

Language is a living thing so it has to change, but God I hate hearing some people's awful attempts at English.

**Do you think that the ‘standard’ pronunciation has changed in your lifetime? What changed?**

I'm only 17 so I can't comment, I will update this in 80 years.

**Do you see a standard for pronunciation as a good thing, or should regional qualities be maintained / allowed to exist? (in schools/government/etc.)?**

I suppose if everyone spoke the same we could understand each other. I'm awful at understanding Scottish accents.

**Do you feel that a person’s accent is an influence on one’s judgement of that person? In what way?**

true,[deleted],null,null,"I gave ya an upvote but I have a few responses to this.  

I think your right that he is not naturally a true team player but I think this is down to a couple of things. He's is probably just not confident in his passing abilities right now, I have heard him talk in an interview about the many areas of his game he needs to work on and this was one of them. Also I think he is being instructed to play more a direct, goal getting style. This is similar to the way Hulk plays at Porto. He takes a lot of pressure off the striker in this way.

I went back and rewatched the game and I will say that there were two chances were he should have passed, and the rest he was pretty must justified in choosing to shoot. The one chance was to Drogba, who's run actually was slightly late and it would have been a difficult pass to make. The other one was playing the ball back to Torres, which was a definite mistake in not doing so. He did make a few nice passes in the game though, like the layoff to Ramires and he had a very nice assist to Drogba against leverkusen.

As far as Sturridge not being able to produce anything, he has 15 goals in his last 19 premier league starts. We also can't forget he's only 22, the front 3 hasn't developed so much chemistry yet, and he's being played OUT OF POSITION. I think your right that there are obvious areas of improvement for him but he did much more good than bad in this game and I still think it is fair to say he had a great game.

I was totally confused when Kalou came on and I think Torres should start against Valencia.  

The next major issue that needs addressing in this squad is Lampard and I myself don't know how I would deal with it. I think that when he is on his game he needs to be on the pitch. The last few games of his been seriously disappointing, sluggish, and just offering nothing. I like the midfield of Meireles, Romeu, Ramires. But what do we do? Do we start benching him more?

That sounds very nearly exactly what I was looking for.  I'm on Orange PAYG at the moment but now I want to get an internet phone, and their plans are annoying for me.  I do maybe 10 minutes of calls per month, probably spend all of 60 quid a year on PAYG.  Their cheapest plans are £15/mo and that's only 100MB of internet which sounds completely useless considering the whole point of getting a smartphone for me is to use spotify, lastfm and skype.  To get a decent data allowance you have to spend 40 quid on the 900 minutes plan.  What the fuck do I want 900 minutes for?  I'd rather hang myself than spend that long on the phone.

Sorry, getting on a rant.  Point being, these guys look pretty suitable for me, but then I'd have to buy a phone outright, yeah?  I wonder if it still works out cheaper once I account for that.

Basically, you can get an item from anywhere really, doesn't have to be in a shop near your house, and then what you do is... You pay for the item using some form of credit (not cash, this is an invisible representation of hard money) and then what they do is wrap it up, write your address on it, then it goes to this special place called the ""post office"". Bear with me, because this is where it gets complicated.

So the people at the ""post office"" read your name and address written on the outside of the ""package"" or item you ""ordered"", then they work out where you live, and if it's in a different country, they put it on a plane or a boat which is travelling to your country. When it arrives here, it's sent to another sort of ""post office"" where a different person reads your address, and gives it to yet another person to drive it out to your house. He then puts the package through your letterbox or mailbox or whatever they have over in the faux-country.

*Do you feel that Received Pronunciation provides a proper standard of English pronunciation (for educational and institutional purposes)? Does it properly reflect the average, most widely understood form of English?*

I don't necessarily think it's any better than other accents, but I think it's the most widely understood by a hairs breadth. Occasionally accents can make it harder to understand others, although this can equally be down to a different dialect. It's good that the BBC no longer use it as the exclusive on-screen accent - there's nothing wrong with any regional variation, and it's a more realistic representation of spoken English.


*What area are you from?*

South West, around Bristol.


*How would you describe your own accent? Was it always like that or was your accent different before?*

RP, I suppose, although calling the Queen's English brings to mind the stereotypical upper-class accent which I don't have. It's not regional at all. My accent's always been pretty much the same, although people commented on touches of somerset/Bristolian when I was younger.

*Are you familiar with Estuary English?*

I wasn't before, but after reading the link it seems to be what I'd call an Essex accent.

*Have you noticed any qualities of Estuary English (see wiki) in your area? (I'm told that Estuary English is becoming more widespread, so I basically want to know if you have noticed any of that.)*

I've certainly not noticed any changes, but I'd say we have these similarities:

* Non-rhotic
* Broad A
* T glottalisation (heard commonly, but seems to be a person-to-person thing)
* Yod coalescence (Very much so. To pronounce ""dune"" as ""d-yune"" rather than ""june"" would be considered very posh)
* Wholly-holy split (Not entirely sure on the definition from wikipedia, but I think so)

*Do you feel that the widespread qualities of Estuary English should be reflected in the ‘standard’ pronunciation? (As in: should RP be changed to reflect changes in common pronunciation or should we attempt to uphold the old standard and try to keep away intrusive qualities such as the ones that distinguish Estuary English from RP?)*

I was under the impression that RP was a distinct accent, it just happened to be the one that was considered standard. To incorporate elements of estuary would be changing the definition - why not incorporate the Scottish or Welsh accent into it? Should it become the most common, then the pronunciation we consider standard should be changed, not the definition of the current standard.

*Do you think that the ‘standard’ pronunciation has changed in your lifetime? What changed?*

Not that I've noticed - people have always had either a regional accent or RP. Estuary seems to be the Essex accent, which seems as common as it ever was in the south east.

*Do you see a standard for pronunciation as a good thing, or should regional qualities be maintained / allowed to exist? (in schools/government/etc.)?*

Standards of pronunciation should be maintained for the sake of understanding, but there's no need to teach people to talk in a certain accent. Things seem to be fine at the moment - people have their accents, and you can understand everyone.

*Do you feel that a person’s accent is an influence on one’s judgement of that person? In what way?*

Not always, but certain accents have stereotypes attached to them. Somerset/Bristolian makes you a bit simple, pronounced RP makes you posh/snobby etc. It's not taken hugely seriously, but it still happens.",0,1323031330,null,0,false,0,c35862f,t3_mz6h6,t1_c35862f,t3_mz6h6,1427972358,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

You are right that because giffgaff is sim only, that you will have to buy a handset separately. When I was looking at getting the new iPhone, this was the cheapest way of going about it [source](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/deals/cheap-iphone).

One thing that you have to remember is that one of the reasons that they can offer such good deals compared to other providers is that they have cut out some services. For example, I don't think that they have any call centre staff at all.

as for this:
&gt;Do you feel that the widespread qualities of Estuary English should be reflected in the ‘standard’ pronunciation? (As in: should RP be changed to reflect changes in common pronunciation or should we attempt to uphold the old standard and try to keep away intrusive qualities such as the ones that distinguish Estuary English from RP?)

&gt;I was under the impression that RP was a distinct accent, it just happened to be the one that was considered standard. To incorporate elements of estuary would be changing the definition - why not incorporate the Scottish or Welsh accent into it? Should it become the most common, then the pronunciation we consider standard should be changed, not the definition of the current standard.

Good point about that and I agree with you too. Just a poor choice of words on my part really, I kind of used RP and standard pronunciation as interchangeable, which their not.",0,1323037381,null,0,true,0,c35948d,t3_mz6h6,t1_c35948d,t1_c35862f,1427972807,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Just know that the classics were made in a different time, and appreciate the excellent plot structure and story telling devices, and the British sci-fi-ness. A good amount of the 4th Doctor's stories were even written in part or in whole by the one and only Douglas Adams, so you know there's some awesome quality in there!

I would say watch through the classics, then give [Big Finish Audio](http://www.bigfinish.com/) a chance. Big Finish makes audio plays that, once you're used to the medium, are on par with the 2005 series in terms of all-around quality, and you can get to experience all of the 8th Doctor's adventures that we couldn't see on screen.

I think local charity works best at local companies. At my work we always try to support local charities and I think that's the best way to go for any charity that exists on a local level in the UK. 

Just to add, I realise that bigger charities are becoming more and more aware of their admin costs being an issue for donators, I believe Shelter are now at 1% admin costs and the staff they use for street sign ups are in house which is a good thing.

It's not a populist choice. It's not Torvill and Dean, nearly an armful of blood or a man hitting a car with a branch. It's something that had a real impact. Ken Loach disagrees mind, and it does seem as if things have gone backwards.

Out of those the most dangerous have been maxi and bellamy who both are really wide forwards (i.e. how bellamy played for city, and maxi played for A. Madrid).  Both come inside from the left on their right foot which naturally puts them closer to the center for goal scoring positions whereas downing on the left tends to start from further back and go wide, or come in on his left and loses the ability to shoot.

I'd love us to pick up another kind of player like that for the right side, especially seeing how much we attack down the left.  i.e. an adam johnson (he just renewed his contract though).

I was drawing partly on the evidence I have garnered from speaking to people who were working during or before the 1970's when the balance of power hadn't yet swung so far away from working people. It seems to that things have never been easy, but that in the last few decades work hours and income inequality have increased while pension rights have been eroded. Greater centralisation seems to have some role to play in forcing people to travel further to work, which I suspect has a real impact on people's happiness. 
It's worth saying that I was not really referring to the public sector with my initial post.

true,rthrtylr,wiltshire,Chippenham. Arr.,"Yes, I am aware of RP, I speak it for the most part. Mixed with a bit of [Wiltshire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv0RIwdVrRg), oddly.

Yes and no. It's by no means an average English accent, that'd be London mathematically, but it's probably about as understandable as English gets, and worldwide certainly.

I'm from Wiltshire in the rural south-west of the country. Our accent is variations on the sort of thing I just posted, that's sort of a classical-Wiltshire accent. I'm somewhere between there and the RP I grew up with, biasing to RP. I did pick up a bit of Estuary from living in Portsmouth (navy town) for a few years, and I sometimes lapse into a touch of Oklahoman drawl I picked up from living there for many years and being married to an Okie. Which is weird, accents are oddly mobile. Never picked up any Welsh from living in Cardiff though, odd that. ;)

Yes I am familiar with Estuary English. It's that horrible sometimes-faux London that's becoming the background hum to our various dialects. That's the best way I can think of to describe it.

No, I think RP and Estuary serve two distinct purposes as modes of speech. They're both different linguistic toolboxes if you like, you can do different things with them. I mean, in a way formal RP is a mode I switch on when I need to be very, very clear, or if I'm in excessively polite mode, the more local accents turn up in more social contexts, and I'm not the only one to do that. And there is a standardised Estuary already in place, it's used by broadcasters as a signifier for ""Informal"". But RP is brilliant for anything labelled ""Take This Shit Seriously"", again, especially worldwide. In that context Estuary has a tendency to confer the air of a wanker. (Sorry if I've overtyped this!)

Also, you can't just ""change"" a pattern of speech. RP is pretty artificial, but you couldn't change it now, it's too entrenched. But it does adapt, as English is wont to do, and has done over the centuries. It's a lot less class specific now for instance.

Yes, it has changed, in that there is a real ""standard"", but on average the various strands of average English have shifted, as they always do. It's an incredibly mobile language. But the BBC has got a mote more informal, there's a lot more leeway for local accents, or at least bowdlerised versions of them, and since we look to the BBC for that ""standard"" I'd say that's about it. 

I think both are good things, and there's room for it all, and frankly this is a pretty old debate. Accents and dialects, and on a larger scale, languages themselves, shift, come and go, mutate and evolve. In reality there's never been a standard, just a current consensus on the average. But both are pretty vital, in the truest sense of the word.

Yes indeed, one is absolutely judged by speech in the first few seconds of meeting, and it's a very powerful impression. When I spoke in America it actually turned heads and would have me surrounded like some kind of oddity, it's that big of a deal to people. The number of times I heard ""...like that Stephen Fry guy"", and if that's not an instant judgement I don't know what is. But talk loike a Wiltshoire maan and people take you for a moron. 

Like I said, RP is a very useful mode to be able to switch on, and I don't mean that in terms of mimicry, I think everyone who does is able to switch between formal and informal forms (try saying that drunk), if only subconsciously. And I think co-knowledge between people of a ""standard"" is, I suppose, a politeness, a mark of respect certainly, and in certain contexts an inability to do that would be regarded crass and ignorant.

Anyway, sorry if that's a lot of waffle of no use, and mostly it's fact-free opinion, but take it as you will! :)",0,1323056951,null,0,true,0,c35c52f,t3_mz6h6,t1_c35c52f,t3_mz6h6,1427974297,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Honestly didn't find it that good. It was incredibly unsettling to watch and leaves a bad taste in your mouth (as it should), so it was a powerful piece of film, but it just failed to get the message across imo, as well as having a few weird plotlines that seemed to go nowhere due to the short length.

Essentially I think my problem is that it boils down to the show pointing out that people will watch terrible things out of morbid curiousity. I don't know if being from the internets has anything to do with this, but that's something of a ""no shit"" revelation for me at least. I also feel like it missed addressing social media in anything more than a roundabout way of ""hey look twitter is pretty big now"" and ended up just being a pretty grim tale about a man fucking a pig - since without decent moral messages that's what it was. (Here I mean messages not already obvious to me).

The plot sort of left me feeling :| at the end, like I hadn't gained any insight of thinking points from it and instead had just seen a mock-up of bestiality. The whole end thing was a bit contrived I found, I could suspend my disbelief to think that terrorists would decide to humilate, and that the PM may actually take it as he did - but not to the extent that those behind it wasn't prosecuted for mentally scarring the PM (nor that the whole country would remain tuned in for an hour, to be honest).

true,ax4of9,null,null,"I would rather we build on Spearing and buy another player to take the pressure off the midfield. Spearing looks capable, his athleticism and dedication on the field is not in question. I agree that he seems to get a little too excited at times, running around like a headless monkey chasing the ball, but that is due to inexperience and I believe that he will do well given some time. Remember how long Lucas took. 

I do admit that Spearing is nowhere near the best defensive midfielder around, but buying a ""star"" DM will actually create problems. Firstly, we have no idea how settled this player will be. Foreign players usually have problems settling into life in England, asking them to do it during mid-season is too much of a risk. Furthermore, it will result in us having 3 DMs once Lucas comes back, and that is 1 too many. 

tl;dr - Spearing was always meant to be the back-up to Lucas, so let him be the back-up now. Buying another DM negates the point of having a back-up. 

Edit: There are still a few weeks until January, so lets give Spearing a chance to perform first. Lucas' injury is a big hit, but there's no need for everyone to panic. ",0,1323063995,null,0,false,0,c35d6r9,t3_n084g,t1_c35d6r9,t3_n084g,1427974791,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

true,Stereotypical_Kansan,null,null,"There are two sides of the coin here, sort of a cost/benefit analysis: The risk of injury vs. the risk of unsettling an on-form team for Anelka and a question of potential and sustainability for Alex.

For Anelka, assuming Pavlyuchenko is gone, it would be a case of determining what risk we want to take. Do we want to risk Adebayor/vdV getting an injury or do we want to risk Defoe becoming completely unsettled and possibly entering a transfer request by becoming 4th on the pecking order. I personally would rather see money spent on a long-term replacement rather than a short-term. But it's up to Harry and Levy of course, Anelka is a journeyman with questionable motivation, but he is a proven goal scorer who would come at a relatively inexpensive price.

For Alex, assuming Bassong may leave, there are multiple questions to be asked: Do we have faith that Kaboul will continue to develop into a top CB that could someday  become a talisman for Spurs? Same question for Dawson as well, if we have aspirations to challenge for the top in the PL, is he going to be able to be one of the CB's that gets us there and keeps us there? How much more are we going to get out of King and Gallas? Personally, I think Alex on the cheap would be an excellent signing if we could sell Bassong. He is tall, strong, and good in the air. Furthermore, I have no idea why Chelsea are selling him - Sideshow Bob Luiz has done more than enough this year in my opinion to show that he does not have the discipline, skill, or maturity to be a top CB in the PL.

The most important thing for me right now is to keep the status quo. ",0,1323068821,null,0,true,0,c35dsoi,t3_n0qud,t1_c35dsoi,t3_n0qud,1427975078,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

Some people watched it thought it was cool, then it got posted on 4chan. Perhaps it was the art style, or the positive light-hearted subject matter, but it got so popular that it got banned from the boards for a little while, creating splinter communities of ""bronies"" creating derivative art and music and fanfiction. I would guess that part of the reason of the success of these communities is that it's based on a show whose theme is *friendship*.

The popularity of the show among internet-dwelling males didn't go unnoticed by the writers. They took note, and kept up what they were doing in Season 2, but this time chock-full of memes.

But of course it has the added bonus of pissing people off even more since you were obviously going too slow in the first place.

true,dontaskagain,uk,Manchester,"I was tasked with trialling DHL/Yodel as a potential replacement for Interlink at work. Unfortunately this trial spanned the period when they were breaking away from DHL and merging with HDN. 

The service we got from them was just awful. From the Buggy software to the rep that never answered his phone to the driver that turned up at random times, it all just sucked. But their prices were dirt cheap so we give them more time than they deserved.

It didn't take long for customers to start complaining, We investigated a few issues, a common occurrence was for someone to stop in all day waiting for the parcel and no one ever came, only for YoDHL to record it as carded (a successful delivery in their eyes) and so made the report stats look rosey. 

Thing is, Yodel use 'lifestyle drivers' meaning it's just a man with a Van. There's no obligation for a driver to ring you up if they can't find your address, they can just take it back to their house! So if you miss your delivery, they happen to leave a card and you want to collect it the same day, well you'll just have to hope the driver goes back to the depot that day otherwise you have to wait another day or hope they find your house next time.

I felt bad for the customers having to deal with this, about as much as I felt sorry for myself trying to handle the switch over from DHL easy ship to Yodel desk dispatch software. See they told us this switch was coming and a day would come when we would have to move away from DHL, fine I said, just keep us informed and as soon as you can provide me the new software I will set it up, to which they promised they would. I was most surprised when I came in to work one day to find the DHL software refused to print any labels. Turns out the switch had happened and the DHL software had been disabled nationally. It was a frantic day to install and configure the Yodel software that day..

Also worth mentioning is how unfinished the Yodel software is. When you generate a manifest it will build a pdf and display it within the software itself. If you try to print the manifest the software crashes and the manifest is lost forever. I actually had an email from Yodel telling us not to attempt to print the manifests (after we learned the hard way not to), instead we should save them and open them in a pdf reader of choice and then print them... It would take around 3 minutes to start, seemingly going through an installation process every time. Then there's the crashes, the many many crashes.. Or the days where it just doesn't want to print any labels. Sure you can restart it, restart the PC, restart the label printer, swap the label printer but it won't print. Then you'll ring tech support and while on hold for 25 mins it'll just start shitting labels out all over the warehouse floor...Urgh. 

All in all, the low rates they gave (I think it was £3.60 per parcel where as Interlink is about £4.10) were not worth pissing off our customers and losing parcels all the time.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"As someone who knows a little bit about the clinical research industry this is a good idea that was, yet again, hijacked by for-profit motives and that makes it potentially, harmful. I wouldn't be too worried though, in terms of regulation the FDA and MHRA, amongst others, have us pretty well protected these days.

What pharma will, inevitably, attempt to do is use the data to do is dubiously attempted to discredit competitors drugs in order to make their own look better for the prospects of marketing their new shiny compound that basically does what currently existing drugs do but with slightly different side effects.

What should be done is:

* Setting up a resource within the NHS for centralised clinical data in order to improve epidemiology generally. This should be public funded as profit would be a harmful motive.
* Give data to university research projects. Don't charge for it. In fact, open it up to anyone. Want to write a program that diagnoses patients illnesses using some AI? Go for it.
* This should only be completely anonymous but drugs wouldn't be granted licence if it wasn't the case so though so the point is moot.

Also, I would like to note that if the regulation changes it shouldn't be *just* NHS hospitals that are effected it should be any hospital, any clinic or anyone that is being practised on by someone with a licence to practice medicine. This does three crucial things for me:

* It actually tests the efficacy of private care vs public care; empirically it is known stuff like child birth in the NHS is far better: more experience, better equipment, better preparation for bad things happening.
* Does not make private medicine look appealing to pay for because your disease, pregnancy, embarrassing illness or whatever won't be announced to the world. Patients are, by default, stupid and don't understand the implications unless they are explained to them.


&gt;Cameron is also expected to announce details of a scheme that could give cancer suffers and other seriously ill patients access to potentially beneficial drugs up to a year before they have been fully licenced.

Declaration of Helsinki, basically, states that if a person's life can be saved by a treatment it is more unethical to refuse it so the emotional charge in this statement is actually irrelevant. Licences take time for good reasons. they'll sell it to us with the idea of cancer treatment and execute it with anti-depressants. 

This thing about clinical trials for profit is junk too; trials are run where its cost effective to run them. It is, often, more cost effective to run clinical trials in other countries like parts of eastern Europe, not because of regulation but because of overheads. Furthermore; more clinical trials doesn't mean better drugs, it means cheaper costs for pharma companies. Most treatments aren't tested against a placebo or no treatment because it would be horribly unethical. Patients have to consent to trials and they should not be coerced by their doctors, just presented with the facts, with the exception of treatment vs no treatment/terminal illness, anything else is kind of criminal.

Don't be fooled, most drugs released today are copy cat drugs that attempt to reduce the profit of competitors Cameron sees the economic side but I'm not firmly convinced that more/bigger pharmaceutical companies is better for the country or patients (in fact, I'm thoroughly unconvinced).  Drug companies pay Millions to lobby government, they pay even more to cover up their motives and bad science.

One more very important point; no stage 4 clinical trials. These are basically marketing exercises for drug companies and happen after a licence is granted. If they want the data the patients should be entirely voluntary.

tl;dr The ethics are curious in this because; If they sold it as patient care then it would be in line with the helskini declaration. As they sell it as ""Look at this, these companies can make money. Economics!"" it seems like it will be badly executed.",0,1323081924,null,0,false,0,c35esas,t3_n0xb8,t1_c35esas,t3_n0xb8,1427975544,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Edit:  Ignoring speeding tickets, I'm saying if you're crap at crime you're probably crap at driving too.  NOT saying truckers are thick (my brother's one!).",0,1323084308,null,0,true,0,c35ewmh,t3_n0wi1,t1_c35ewmh,t3_n0wi1,1427975600,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; There is a lot to be said for the 'political football' comment. Both sides can be accused of ideological positioning and being ignorant of the detail. After all large parts of what the public considers the NHS are already private (GPs for example).

Very true. Also posturing from outlets such as the Guardian or New Statesman doesn't help. All that happens is that we end up comparing idealized versions of the NHS with nightmare scenarios from the US system, while ignoring the various approaches to providing universal healthcare that are on offer on the continent or globally. 

&gt; Anyone who has worked in the NHS or has friends working there knows that a fortune is wasted, and that working practices and management behaviours are insane at times compared to the commercial world. Demographics and treatment improvements also means that today's organisation cannot carry on as it is and that change must come.

If anything, the very size of the the NHS is somewhat of a problem. Any large organization suffers from a decline in efficiency as it gets larger, simple because it becomes harder and harder to properly organize it as scale increases. As it is, I do believe the NHS is probably at the upper limit for organizational scale, and further increases in funding with the current model will suffer from declining returns on investment.

&gt; Saying all that, and not being anti-private business involvement I would add that past government forays into partnerships seem to have been managed by idiots so my trust in a lot of these annoucements is low.

I would argue that this is simple the result of a British attitude to regulation, as we seem to have issues with this in general.

I agree with you on the ownership/access issue.  Anyone who has an older sibling will know that you have access to a lot more books, but you tend to own far fewer (your older sibling owns them).

Also the percentages in this report are a little odd.  They've taken the percentage that agreed with a statement and then given the percentage that falls into the three reading groups (eg of those who didn't own books, 36% were above the level of reading they'd expect to be, 45% were at the right level and 19% were below that level).

Studies like this are all well and good, but it would be good to have some recommendations at the end of it.  They've clearly studied the project a lot so should be in a better position than us to say what can be done about it?  One thing I took from the report was that kids couldn't find things to read that interested them.  Maybe the books we provide at school aren't of a broad enough range.

(http://www.bookstart.org.uk/bookstart-packs/). 
They give you more when your child starts nursery.

There is also something set up by Dolly Parton called Imagination Library. This gives children in participating areas a free book every month between the age of one month and five years old (http://imaginationlibrary.com/). These free books are all for younger children but I would be surprised if there is nothing for school starters and those in education.

true,ColonelPanic2409,welsh,Cardiff,"There is a guy in my third year class at University who proudly boasts that he has never read a book in his life. I lent him my copy of 1984 which I thought would be a gripping first book and a relatively easy read. I think he managed a few pages before he went back to the Xbox.

As somebody who has recently come through the education system, I have seen first hand that there is a huge problem with getting young people to take their education seriously - even University students who are paying thousands of pounds a term to attend. They are financially invested in it, but most have made no emotional investment whatsoever.

I don't think that being thick is seen as cool (as another commenter suggested), but being apathetic certainly is. At University level I have found that my peers view me as strange and annoying because I ask the lecturer questions - I don't see how I'm supposed to learn without asking questions and I'm shocked that nobody else does. Worse than that, the lecturer can ask a question to the class in an attempt to engage people and I will look around the room waiting for somebody to answer it. Nine times out of ten I will give in after an awkward silence and answer it myself. 

Intellectual pursuit seems to be anathema to the hive-minded majority who would rather be watching The X Factor. We only have ourselves to blame for creating a society which engenders the idea that theoretically anybody could become rich and famous by showing up to an audition, turning on the waterworks, revealing their tragic backstory and saying how much it would mean to them to get through to the next round. If you don't have an unfortunate childhood to exploit, no problem, just shag a footballer. I wonder when the general public will realise that it doesn't really work like that and that the majority of successful people are intelligent and hard-working, not talentless air-headed shills squeezing out shitty auto-tuned covers.

* I've had Yodel leave the parcel on the front lawn when the customer has been in all day and he's not knocked or left a card.

* The worst i've heard, and I personally got the guy fired for it was when the delivery man refused to take a large heavy parcel into a customers house. And then after walking away from the elderly woman he sat in his van laughing at her as she struggled to carry it in.

Most tenancy agreements go on either a 6 month or a 12 month contract, the majority being the latter. AS for accommodation, it's available all year round but most of the student properties have their contracts beginning between July-September, so if you were after one of these specifically then I would start looking around late May early June, but it never hurts to get a few months more research in.

Some letting agents won't let out to students full stop, and some will only deal with postgraduates like yourself. It may be worth emailing round the letting agencies in Brighton &amp; Hove and asking if they could forward you a list of student properties that are going to possibly be available from those periods to you. 

I presume that you are not currently based in the United Kingdom? If so then you're going to be limited to online resources for now i.e. websites of letting agents etc. It would be well worth your while to contact the [Residential Services](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/residentialservices/) at the University to see what they say about the matter.

Of course, all of the above is in relation to if you were to actually go out and rent a property yourself. There is of course the other option of finding a houseshare with people who have already rented the property and are looking for someone to join them. Good websites for this include the Brighton [Gumtree](http://www.gumtree.com/) and [Craigslist](http://brighton.craigslist.co.uk/). Do be warned however that such arrangements are not always legally binding and you will indeed be subletting from a person already on the tenancy agreement. It may or may not be in your interests to be on the tenancy agreement of the property as a named individual.

true,hireddithowareyou,lfcflame,,"Just how important was Lucas' role to LFC? [This](http://www.eplindex.com/lucas-leiva-difficult-replace-stats-analysis/) along with [this](http://www.eplindex.com/jay-spearing-jordan-henderson-starts-lfc/) are the best articles on the topic.  In my mind, we MUST replace him because he was an absolute superstar and there is no other superstar DM that can take over his role. It is difficult to argue that Spearing or Agger could cover for the kinds of stats Lucas has been putting up and none of our other players on the squad could fulfill the holding midfielder role.

I must respectfully disagree with your choice to put Gerrard in that group of in-house replacements because I am of the same mindset as boomerbower - Gerrard has poor defensive capabilities. Regardless, I'd rather have Gerrard up front to help inspire and resolve the poor finishing as of late with his dynamic personality. He is our talisman up front and makes magic happen when he can dictate/play a role in the attack in the final 1/3 of the field. He is a prime example of heart AND other-worldly quality, a combination Spearing lacks.

Spearing, it seems to me, has been groomed to be a backup to Lucas (or whatever superstar plays in this position), not to be a replacement. Spearing is no Alonso, no Mascherano, and no Lucas. He may be able to do just fine fulfilling the role of backup, but - as unpopular of an opinion as this may be - his heart and dedication to the squad cannot make up for his obvious lack of comparative quality that these spectacular Reds have had in fulfilling the role of holding midfielder. His love for the squad is what makes him such a perfect backup - he's the kind of player that is just happy to be on the squad, willing to fill whatever role the club asks of him, and gets on with his work as a professional.

I think if we take Agger and put him in as a DM, his role in the middle of the backline with Skrtel will be even harder to overcome than Lucas. Carragher has been overshadowed by Skrtel and Agger in terms of physical capability when playing 90 minutes week in and week out. If we were to take Agger out of CB, who do we have to take his spot? Remember, a replacement for the role - not a backup - is the key idea we need to keep in mind when thinking of what to do. Kelly is great as an RB and has become almost interchangeable with Johnson. He will be a replacement, not just a backup, soon. At this point though I don't see that he would be ready to replace Agger as a CB, if that is in fact where he may end up playing as some have suggested. Coates - and I am a huge fan - is still a player for the future. Anyone else is simply not ready or capable to be a season-long replacement for Agger, should Agger move up.

Our CBs, especially with our more attacking play, have been, along with the DM we had in Lucas, the key, in my opinion, to our defensive quality this season. Pepe, two strong CBs, and a DM with superstar capabilities are the necessary foundation to any sort of league challenge or top 4 finish. We may be rebuilding, but we are not rebuilding from a middle of the league squad, and we cannot allow that attitude to seep in. Replace a superstar with a superstar, not a backup. That is the only way we will be able to take back our seat on the throne.",0,1323099530,null,0,true,0,c35g52v,t3_n084g,t1_c35g52v,t3_n084g,1427976188,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Dossena,null,null,"Reward Kelly for his  goal at Chelsea by starting him ahead of Johnson. Also gives Glen a bit of a break after playing so much.  

Fulham don't seem to be a huge threat this season so give Carra a game partnering Agger at CB. 

Keep Enrique at leftback. 

Maxi got his second Hattrick last season against Fulham. Let him play and hopefully do the same again this time. 

Hendo has played a few 90 minute games in a row, maybe give him a break this time. 

Spearow in for the injured Lucas. 

Think these are the type of games where Carroll can get some good practice with little pressure so play him up front. 

Suarez obviously needs to play, just let him roam about freely. Him + Maxi should be a good combination

Plus Adam and Bellamy. 

So:

                  Reina
    Kelly   Carra     Agger   Enrique
          Spearow   Adam
    Bellamy    Suarez      Maxi

people will not know how much an operation costs going private or NHS, Private will chase operations that they can maximise profit on and bill the NHS, People choose private as the waiting times are shorter than the NHS.

Private then bills NHS at more than it would cost NHS to carry out the operation, but as people chose private over NHS it cannot refuse to pay it.

NHS budgets go bust as they simply cannot afford to pay for operations. People then have a choice. Pay to go private or wait to go NHS,

But being transport people safely to mars, even for a one way trip, and have them arrive healthy enough and sane enough, then keep the alive for long enough to actually achieve anything useful is going to be much harder. Pretty much impossible with our current level of technology. For a start, any ship we're going to build will need to be constructed in orbit, and that's something we don't really have much experience with. And that ship will have to be big enough to carry the food, fuel and water to support the people for 9 months, in addition to a lander module which is big enough to sustain people for at least 3 months. It will also have to be big enough to allow them to exercise. And it has to be entirely self sufficient. 

Essentially, they will need to build something along the lines of Gotland class submarine in orbit, even for a one way trip. And we just can't do that yet. 

Also, money does come into it, as a resource calculator.

We kept the skill sets, advantages and disadvantages, but ported the actual mechanic over to the D10 system used in L5R.

As far as handling stuff on the fly, you want to always listen to the choices your players make. Many's the RPG I've run where what the players wanted to investigate was actually more interesting than what I had planned out ahead of time.

true,doonjoot,null,null,"&gt;I've known people who would rather live off £100 a week so they can keep their benefits than get more hours which would mean they're better off. Its a stupid dumbass ideology I can't get my head round but there's millions of people in the UK with that mindset.

Well, lets just play devils advocate here.

Say I'm unemployed, on £63 a week dole money, and £70 a week housing benefit. I also have my council tax paid for me, so that's another £15 a week, assuming I'm sharing a house. 

Effectively, that makes my income £148 pounds a week. Now if I worked a minimum wage job, for 37 hours a week, my net income would be £192. Say I spend £15 of that commuting (a number I picked because it's the price a weekly bus ticket where I live). That means that taking a minimum wage job would only leave me £29 pound a week better off.

Put another way, that's 79 pence for every extra hour I worked. ",0,1323114058,null,0,false,0,c35ii3e,t3_n00dl,t1_c35ii3e,t1_c35f4j6,1427977296,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Why are you accepting, without any supporting evidence, 'trickle down' economics that were discredited when they were first wheezed up? The richest people pay more tax because they take more out of the country. They take from the many and give to themselves. 

Their businesses are subsidised by ordinary people who pay thousands of pounds a year just to have their bins emptied 25 times. The bars that make millions while expecting the police - that you pay for - to clear up the vandalism and damage? They don't pay their fair share. The KFC franchises that got tax payer subsidies to open up, get a discount on refuse collection, and pay nothing towards fighting obesity or heart disease? They don't pay their fair share.

Everywhere, the Tories and their accomplices have one hand out for your money and the other hand in your pocket taking it from you.

After reading The Writer's Tale, I was blown away by the level of creative deliberation that went on inside his mind, but at the same time I was very disappointed by his tendency for procrastination and laziness, along with an unwillingness to step outside his comfort zone. 

Considering how big Torchwood is, it was always such an afterthought for him. He was originally supposed to write the script for 2x01 and then never got around to it, outsourcing it to another writer. And then, of course, there was Miracle Day, where he took a very narrow idea of what American action television should be like and combined it with his characters, half-assing both in the process. Twice now he's ended Torchwood in a very dissatisfying and uncertain way. We may never see a another series again. If we do, I imagine it'll unfortunately have to include Rex. If we don't, the final scene after over 4 years will have been centered on a new and poorly-received character that was shoved down our throats.

* Responsibility
* Trust
* Training

I do think he and his friends are in a catch-22 situation as they want responsibility and a degree of autonomy but do nothing to show that they can be trusted with it. The other key thing they constantly bring up is the lack of training and the fact that people are put in supervisory roles without any training on how to do it. Usually the most punctual or longest serving person become the team leader and they aren't managed effectively. They come home and complain at how their team leader can't manage simple tasks like organising rotas or ordering stock correctly.

What none of them do (and I have told them) is the basic art of managing your manager by identifying weak spots and helping your manager in that area. They equate this with sucking up or trying to get ahead (well duh).

I think they need a damn good kick up the arse and be shown that the world isn't going to be handed to them on a plate and a degree is worthless without a decent work ethic and skills. I'm probably not the fairest of people to ask as I like working long hours and am focussed on making sure my career goes to plan, even when I worked minimum wage jobs I was always doing extra bits and suggesting things to the management (to keep me entertained). When I worked in a bar I did their website for them and when I did data entry I wrote them a new set of spreadsheets and databases to track employee performance (that really endeared me to my colleagues).

That actually might be another aspect which holds back your unskilled workers, the feeling that to get ahead you need to tread on your colleagues; that doing something well highlights their lack of skills and motivation.",0,1323117409,null,0,true,0,c35j3i0,t3_n00dl,t1_c35j3i0,t1_c35hupm,1427977642,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,calledpipes,null,null,"Yeah, i see what you mean about the private companies over charging for services, hell, they are out to make money and so why shouldn't they. In the end the NHS is paying for private medical care, and they are paying simply for the fact that the health care provided is not preformed in an NHS hospital. Thing is i wonder if that will still happen when private hospitals are filled with normal NHS patients?

I do understand you exactly saying that that the NHS will probably be overcharged for any service they don't directly provide, remember when it turned out the MOD were paying £20 for a light bulb, simply because they bought from the same place every time? It'll be exactly like that! Plus, as with all things private, you can guarantee that every year the price will increase above inflation, look at energy companies, price rises above the rise in oil price, so that profit increases year on year.

I also hear a lot about how little money, equipment, staff and logical management the NHS has, I'm the son of two NHS workers, a Doctor and a nurse (Cliché right?) With a problem like yours, the surgery has to pay for your bandages, because I'm assuming that you are under 60. (Free for the over 60s) But bandages are expensive, they come from a private company, therefore the surgery only ever orders them when an OAP comes in. There are a lot of complications that arise from the separation between surgeries and the NHS, and who pays for what. (Surgeries are under funded as fuck.)

My final gripe, and I'm sorry that you are the one having this replied at you, is the destruction of the PCTs (Primary care trusts (NHS management)). When this government said they were breaking them appart, instantly the talent left, all of the talented managers left for other jobs. This left PCTs with everyone who didn't leave the sinking ships fast enough, who all know that there job won't be around for another year. Naturally, bad for moral. The government then assured everyone that the PCTs wouldn't be broken up until they ""are ready"" and so they will be gone in a few years or so. In the mean time any incumbent PCT staff say everything isn't their responsibility, because they won't be around for much longer, while the surgeries are struggling to operate with no one at the top providing any leadership. 

All of this is being done so that eventually the doctors can take over the management (remember the doctors all have full time jobs, and i have seen that they work hard at these jobs). No doctor is going to take on additional managerial duties as well as their current responsibilities. Once again, private companies are there graciously to help run the management, for only the smallest cut of the value of the surgery. Hooray!

Yeah, the NHS will be privatised in a few years, both management, and practices, and all of it will be funded with public money, all under the guise of greater choice for the user and decreasing costs.

I seriously don't think anyone in our side can finish aside from Maxi and Suarez. And since Suarez is pretty much triple covered all game we have no chance of scoring. We need to sign a striker who is a proven finisher...

Andy Carroll will go down as a colossal mistake in my opinion.

true,Robinoo,null,null,"I did something similar, company called Hermes (although used to be parcelnet). Biggest fucking scam going. 90% of all clothing online along with QVC and other catalogue shit gets sent through, as well trying to compete with royal mail and other courriers public delivery services. It got delivered to my house, anywhere from 60-120 parcels a day (which never ever averagely decreased) and it was impossible to do before 8pm (the cut off point). The lorry would roll up at 11am 30mins-2hrs late every day (although the lorry drivers understood the shitness of the job and were genuinely sorry), then I had to scan every single parcel, work out the quickest way to deliver them and best way to sort them out for easy access in the car (this would take you to midday), and you had to deliver them all otherwise you were fucked, they would roll over to the next day, and this was only for 1/4 of the smallish town I live in. We got paid 45p for a 'packet' and 55p for a 'parcel', a rate which they had not increased for over 10 years. 

Places like NEXT charged £4 for the delivery, and to cut costs even cheaper, they (along with all the rest) would get parcels, and just put them in a bag and call it a packet. I got told my nissan micra would be fine and it would only be the occasional large parcel. WRONG. I was delivering microwaves and doing returns on lawnmowers. I was loading my car to the point of illegality and still having to do 3 runs to and from home to pick up more parcels. 

Delivering the parcels was key, and you had to go to every length to try and get it done. This meant over fences, down alleyways, hidden in bins (it's not uncommon for many parcels to get thrown out before the owner even knows it's delivered, luckily I knew when all the bin days were so avoided this)

You are given the worlds shittest scanners, with the worlds shittest touchscreens. Speed in this job was key, and while I was no slouch, the fucking scanner signing thing had me waiting at peoples doors for vital extra minutes, which when you have 120 parcels isn't good for time.

Don't even get me started on pay. These jobs are IMPOSSIBLE to earn minimum wage from, so they exploit 'self employment' laws. On average I was earning £2.50 an hour after expenses and such. 

ANYBODY can become one of these drivers, no background checks or anything, and your parcels are getting delivered to these people. I had to deliver a laptop once, bought from Amazon. I couldn't believe it, when it came to things like that though I never left them. I like to think I was one of the more moral courriers, but I know for a fact there are thousands there who arn't. I will never EVER complain about the post office again, i'm sure i've left out many of the horrors I witnessed while doing this job.

**TL;DR Use proper big name courriers or the Post Office, never get a job as a 'self employed' delivery driver for one of these companies, or infact any 'self employed' job for a large business.**

There will be no public alternative, and as costs balloon due to the soaring profits of these private health companies the concept of free healthcare will have to be rethought. 

This will probably mean that the government will introduce top-up fees for healthcare, and we all know how great that was for higher education. Either that or there will be the introduction of a new tax, health tax! This will be a conservative wet dream, because everyone will be required to pay the same, we all age and get sick equally (effective tax break to the rich), and it will be an opportunity to decrease national insurance and income taxes, because the NHS burden is now shared equally on the shoulders of every citizen.

For what Dalglish appears to want to do, Craig Bellamy or Dirk Kuyt would be a much more suitable strike partner to Suarez. Bellamy has pace to burn and a knack for goal; While Kuyt isn't exactly speedy, he has the technical skill and ability that Andy Carroll simply doesn't at this stage of his development.

true,spiz,null,null,"&gt; By having access to the type and number of treatments that the NHS has provided over the years, private companies will be able to determine which are the inexpensive, quick and profitable treatments. They will then be able to provide these treatments to us for a profit. Which admittedly there is nothing wrong with. This though will undercut the NHS because suddenly all of the treatments that the NHS was able to provide quickly, easily and routinely will be gone.

Darzi started this under Labour years ago.  It's been happening for years - admittedly it'll get worse, but it's not like this is exclusively Conservative policy.  It's a little odd that the minute the Conservatives touch the NHS everyone screams, but when Labour increased participation of the private sector (on terms that are unfavourable to the NHS) no one protested.  

&gt; This loss of the easy, quick treatments to private companies will admittedly cause the NHS budget to decrease, because patients are going else where, and the treatments are being provided for less money by private companies. But, as the cheap treatments are no longer being provided by the NHS, they only have the expensive difficult ones left, meaning that the amount of money required for the NHS its self will not decrease proportionally to the number of patients it is loosing.

And yes, this is what's happening now.  Again mostly because of what Labour started and, ultimately, I doubt they  would do anything differently, given their track record.

true,murphs33,silence,Silence,"Irish acting seems to be a bit more fluid than English acting; a bit less about sounding emotional and a bit more on the skill of talking and adding a particular atmosphere to a character. Collin Farrell is a good example of this in In Bruges, or maybe Brendan Gleeson in The Guard or Harry Potter, or even Richard Harris when he played Dumbledore. 

With English acting I believe it's a bit more about what's behind their words, and there's a lot more emphasis in the voice when making a point than what you would see in American acting. You would also see a lot of obvious misdirection, where you find that the character is masking their real emotions.

American acting, in my opinion, relies mostly on constant reaction to situations and highly emotional acting in every which way. Any other differences, I would say is mostly in the diversity of the cultures. The English style of acting will always have a sense of class and stiff elegance to it, with emphasis on silent emotion. With Irish acting you'll have a laid back looseness to it, though that's not to say it's predictable... and with American acting, confidence and emphasis on the situation at hand.

Of course there are always exceptions to these. If you haven't seen a recent(ish) British movie, I'd suggest Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. It's a damn good gangster movie, and pretty funny. As for Irish, I'd suggest In Bruges, or The Guard. Both really nail Irish acting and humour.

Aside from somehow claiming ""Bragging Rights"" and ""Jack Wilshere's Bet"" as two of the eleven reasons they will finish above us, this right here is what so brilliantly summed up how delusional Arsenal fans can be:

&gt;**Injuries to key players**: 
Like every football team, Tottenham revolves their football around key figures like Luka Modric, Gareth Bale, Rafael van der Vaart and more recently Emmanuel Adebayor therefore injuries to these players will be disastrous to Tottenham’s hopes of a Champions League finish because the replacements are not as reliable as the key players (with the exception of Jermaine Defoe and Roman Pavlychenko).

Are you kidding me? **Spurs** need to be worried about losing a key player? 

If RVP gets injured this season for any period of time Arsenal become a mid-table team, no doubt about it. No matter how much you hate Arsenal, you cannot deny RVP is a damn good player. But do you really think teams would ever fear going up against Chamakh? Who is their third striker? Gervinho? Walcott? 

This season Spurs have covered every injury without skipping a beat. vdV is out? No problem, 2 starts for Defoe, 2 goals in those starts. King is gone? Got it put in Gallas, clean sheet. And I am very confident if either of our maestros went down Sandro would be more than happy to oblige filling their shoes for a couple of games.

TL;DR Don't go full retard and try to understand Gunner logic.

Secondly, the costs of administering means-testing mean that it often ends up as a net cost to the system as a whole rather than a saving.  

As a compromise though, it'd maybe be better if certain universally available benefits weren't automatically activated, so at least people who didn't want or need to receive a benefit didn't get it by default.

The episode opens with a man in the hospital and either Amy,Rory,River,or someone else iconic asleep in a chair next to the bed. Because of lighting( or bandages around head), we can't see the man in the bed's face but we fade off of him and into an adventure already happening with The Doctor . We follow the Doctor and companions in one of the worst situations we've seen him in . There is a betrayal and the Doctor is seriously hurt and knocked unconscious . The companions are dragging him back to the TARDIS with all hell breaking loose . The TARDIS goes into the vortex and there is a slo-mo scene of Rory trying to help the Doctor and Amy and/or River flying. There is alot of blood and Rory is trying to put pressure on the wounds , wrapping up his face ,leaving air holes ofcourse. The TARDIS lands near/in a the hospital and River runs to get a gurney. Amy ,Rory and The Doctor have a silent scene where Rory looks hopeless about The Doctor's survival . The TARDIS starts to implode and the gurney is within sight. Amy and Rory drag the Doctor's body out of the rocking TARDIS and then it explodes bright inside, but the exterior remains intact , blowing Amy and Rory away from the doctor momentarily.{hold that storyline right there...I'll get back to it.} The gurney gets to the trio and runs into the ER , bandages still wrapped around the doctor's face. Rory is giving a briefing to the doctor and nurses. Amy and River are holding eachother for support in the waiting room. Time elapses. Rory comes back saying they did all they could , he is just unconscious now. Amy and River go in and both take a hand of the man in the bed. We then hear another dialogue other the sad music by the illustrious Murray Gold ( he gives my ears a boner btw) and we are given a first person POV of waking up in darkness yet hearing voices about the bandages need to come off. The man( obviously the Doctor we can gather ) is groggily muttering as the bandages come off,something about fishsticks and custard. Amy says something excitedly thinking everything is ok and then the look on her face drops, Rory and River look at each other ,shocked. The man about still sounds abit groggy ,but it is evident that the voice isn't Matt Smith's .  The adventure was a fevered flashback . We are left with a new clueless face , with a sneaky regenerated Doctor.

I'm not entirely sure there *is* a hivemind - what there might be are several/many groups who are more likely to vote on particular issues. Speaking from personal experience, my comments on circumcision have been received vastly differently depending on where it was said and also how the conversation started.

Also on that note (and following on from earlier), although it's not going to be the situation in all cases, as I said before how something is said could be a factor.

When someone knows they're disagreeing with the consensus, even though it shouldn't matter, they might phrase their opinion in a rather defensive or antagonistic way.

Case in point is Ivashkin's first comment: [""Boring shit.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/n11q5/stewert_lee_on_clarkson_and_top_gear/c35fbgz)

Of course this can be legitimately downvoted because it adds nothing to the proceedings. However, it then sets up a feedback loop: ""I was downvoted for disagreeing that X is interesting or funny.""

Saying the rioters were greedy, they took TVs not potatoes, indicates a lack of comprehension of the problems with out society. 

In order to have been about poverty and social exclusion, the general public seem to think there would have been a committee of political rioters strategically planning on looting the LIDL for tins of Tomato soup and packs of fatty mince. 

The idea that a general feeling of hopelessness and alienation created the circumstances for an eruption of irrational behaviour which allowed people to help themselves to the accoutrements of the bourgeoisie is too sophisticated, I suppose.

I value university education, and i think that everyone who is capable of attending should be able to go with as little money down on their part as possible. I don't think that everyone should go to university, if they are not academically capable, or if they would be better suited by other things. At present i agree with the increase in funding and places for apprenticeships, as i think that will put us in a much better place than having 50% of young people with degrees, but from places of poor reputation, and in courses that are not exactly applicable to the real world.

That said, one of the most important things about university is the exposure to different people from different backgrounds.

If you took out all other costs (employees, rent, advertising, equipment, etc including a living wage for your wife), this would be profit, I doubt it is anywhere near 170%

Tesco: Yes, profit might be 5% based on shareholder dividends, but profit is also present in the wages of top executives (e.g. £10 million for a CEO, and a lot of other management paid very well). These people do not add that level of value to their business, so this is surplus taken from employees, which they are able to extract because they are in a position of power.

At first, like most people I guess, I didn't understand the point.  It was just a long dark room with a funny ceiling, a strange table, some pillars, and bits of writing on the walls.  Only when I spoke with other people, and took time to walk around and ""experience"" the room, did I understand.

It's a contemporary park.  The pillars are tree trunks.  The funny ceiling is the leaves.  Lights above the leaves shine through them, casting dappled shadows on the floor and walls.  The table is some kind of park bench, on top of which is scrawled strange runes and symbols.  In the corners and scattered around various points are dark-coloured paper ""leaves"".  It's eerie, and yet beautiful.  It's exactly how I imagined I would like to create a soft, comforting room in my big contemporary house, if I had the money to do so.

The photograph in the BBC article doesn't do the exhibit justice - in reality the room is a lot darker, and the photograph is taken from completely the wrong end of the room - walking in the right door is important.

tl;dr - at first I didn't get it, then I did, then I left thinking it was wonderful.

The reason people hog the middle lane is they don't like switching back out when a truck is in front of them. It is stupid. It is made worse by the fact everyone else is staying out there. The other favourite British driving pastime adds more pain. The tendency to follow close behind someone and then switch lanes just before they would seek to switch lanes. Thus meaning they are travelling too fast for their lane and suddenly can't switch into their intended lane either. Suddenly you are slamming your brakes on because the guy behind you is stupid.

It isn't the worse behaviour though. When it rains everyone immediately switches to the outside lane. Goodness knows why. You end up with an empty middle lane and an outside lane going 60.

Perhaps because we live in such a usually peaceful society we forget that order isn't the natural state of things and riots can always happen when order isn't present. The police deliberately stepped back and allowed the London rioting to continue, that acted like a wildfire and caught on elsewhere as people saw what they could get away with.

I believe the police did this deliberately as a wage and cuts bargaining tool to use against the government, saying 'look what happens without us', and it may have blown up more than they expected. There are many reports of the police standing back and doing nothing early on.

Who decides what's abusive though? By allowing for someone to decide, you restrict people's right to talk freely, in case they offend someone. Personally, I think a society which jails people for speech, even speech like this which I find as dully stupid as it is tiresomely wrong, to be far inferior to one which can just ignore it as the stupid rambling of a stupid woman.

&gt;Her offence is also racially aggravated...in other words, she'll have a bit more punishment tacked on for it not even being a good reason to be ranting and raving at people at the top of your voice.

Right, so we're not just jailing her for being nasty, we're jailing her for being nasty to people about something people are really sensitive about. Wonderful!

&gt;Now in my case, my belief is she could have prompted someone to attack her...they would have been in the wrong, but she would have been the trigger for unnecessary violence. People shouldn't be able to potentially cause violence.

Well you've just violated what you'd like to be a crime then, because honestly people who say stuff like the above make me want to be violent towards them.

&gt;It's like shouting fire in a crowded room.

You understand this argument was created and first used by an American judge to enable political persecution and jail those who spoke out against war they couldn't support the participation of their countrymen in?

&gt;Now you can be naive all you want

Desiring freedom is naive now? Neato.

&gt;but for some reason history has shown that without forced social reform, majority groups have always tended to be a bit shit to minority groups.

Attitudes change. My grandmother was moderately racist, she was born in something like 1910. A century later I am completely non-racist (in fact, non-discriminatory over any grounds which people didn't choose, because it is stupid to do so).

What you're effectively saying though, is that because you find discrimination distateful, people should go to jail so they can't offend you. Once more we get back to the fact that I find this incredibly offensive, and by your own logic you should serve jailtime for this. However you know you won't because you hold a view shared by the majority while she holds a view that few still hold, and so she will be punished and you will not. In seeking to alleviate persecution of minorities, you persecute a minority.

Society at large...if you've lived with the rest of us for a while now, I'm not sure, hence me asking if you were new, you'd know what is and is't deemed abuse.

&gt;By allowing for someone to decide, you restrict people's right to talk freely, in case they offend someone.

She specifically set out to offend. That was what she *wanted* to do. She wasn't giving a sociology lecture on the failure of multiculturalism. Lest not pretend offence would have been come upon by complete accident.

&gt;Right, so we're not just jailing her for being nasty, we're jailing her for being nasty to people about something people are really sensitive about

This isn't about being sensitive, this is about nipping a dangerous trend in the bud. Again are you somehow unaware of the history of race worldwide? Can you give me *your* interpretation of how we got where we are? Is it your position that social change would have just plopped down out of the sky all on it's own and if so, could you explain what on Earth was wrong with our ancestors...did they have some sort of mental deficiency that made them retarded?

It seems your position is any and all political belief should be allowed to flourish unhindered or unchallenged as it's clearly never been a problem in the past!

I never said that, so perhaps you should slow down before you get ahead of yourself. You seem to misunderstand the difference between subjugation (say, slavery, or unequal rights between ""races"") and verbal abuse. For moral and intellectual reasons I support full legal equality for all moral actors (that is, mentally competent adults) regardless of gender, genetics, beliefs, age, intelligence, profession, etc. Where this doesn't exist, I support any push toward it.

I never said the transition was natural, it was effected as a struggle by the efforts of many individuals, and this I support. What I don't support is the idea that verbal abuse is somehow an extension of this subjugation, for it is not.

Of course it does! But we all agree it is better to lock them away because there comes a point where we value protection over freedom.

The same applies to physical abuse. Should happy slappers be free to run around dishing out abuse without fear of repercussion? Of course not!

You misunderstand or willfully misinterpret. I would be angry if this happened, I would not be happy with you and I would probably express this in some way. Me thinking that someone is a twat, and even hating them, is not grounds for me wanting them put in jail though.

&gt; you know what abuse is, but you deem abuse of ethnic minorities not a problem to you.

We're not talking about ""a problem"" here, we're talking about jailing people for saying things we don't like. I don't deem the abuse of anyone to be a moral wrong which they should be jailed for. You want to put people in jail because you don't like what they say. It's authoritarianism pure and simple.

&gt;She specifically set out to offend.

The law should be blind to the content contained in expression, otherwise it is required to make value judgements about expressions of ideas, and must then remove freedom of expression.

&gt;This isn't about being sensitive, this is about nipping a dangerous trend in the bud.

What, people speaking their minds?

&gt;Again are you somehow unaware of the history of race worldwide? Can you give me your interpretation of how we got where we are?

It's not relevant to this case.

&gt;Is it your position that social change would have just plopped down out of the sky all on it's own

Again, you're equivocating two different things. As explained, and perhaps not surprisingly for someone so strongly in favour of rights, I'm big in favour of absolute equality between all moral actors. The persecution and subjugation of minorities was the systematic use of force to remove rights, force labour, and in general physical abuse.

What you're talking about is not subjugation or physical abuse, you're just talking about wanting to ban nasty words and phrases.

&gt;It seems your position is any and all political belief should be allowed to flourish unhindered or unchallenged as it's clearly never been a problem in the past!

My goodness, you would even deny people the right to believe in certain political theories? You do not see how utterly opposed to freedom this position is, and how utterly ironic it is for someone worried about minority freedom to hold?

&gt;And that invalidates it how?

It doesn't per se, what it does is illustrate how that very argument is used to take away people's right to expression, and that inevitably those rights will be taken away under the guise of some great moral protection.

&gt;Wow, and exactly which bubble did you and your grandmother go to to avoid the forced social changes such as those you oppose for all these years to prove your theory?

Which theory? I simply explained that change occurs over time with shifting attitudes which can be brought about with education and shared cultural experiences and time together.

&gt;So, you do have trouble reading?

So you don't think that people should go to jail for discrimination of this sort? That'd be truly fantastic that would!",0,1323190382,null,0,false,0,c35s3x7,t3_n2iu8,t1_c35s3x7,t1_c35rv7c,1427981978,-7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-7

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;To rephrase my question, why should a society that emphasises freedom be superior to a society that emphasises harmony or the protection of its citizens from abuse?

Good question! My argument would be that every human is different, but that every human should be equal. As a result, the choices made by each human will be different, and all of these should be permitted so long as they do not conflict with the rights of another human to do the same. To this end, freedom must be held above harmony or protection of citizens from abuse.

For instance, in a country which values harmony over all else, lets imagine there's an axe murderer on the loose. The head of state knows that the axe murderer has actually managed to flee the country, but that this won't satisfy the general public, they'll still be very disharmonious unless someone is caught. So in order to maximise harmony, the head of state organises for a homeless man who no-one likes or cares about to be executed. The population are satisfied the murderer is dead, and the society is once again highly harmonious.

You see, any time you place any value over and above freedom, you introduce the possibility of situations where it is desirable to take away an individuals right to live their life in the way they see fit (without conflicting with other's right to do the same). For this reason, a society which places freedom above all others allows for the maximal number of people (all of them) to have the maximal freedom of choice, and that allows individuals to pursue a life which fulfils them in whichever way they desire to the maximum extent.

&gt;Fortunately our evolved society recognises that in some cases verbal abuse can be just as damaging as physical abuse and so we outlaw this too.

It isn't though, because I can shout at you and you can shout at me and nothing happens. Nothing occurs. We just shout at each other. You might take offence, I might take offence, but then I might take offence at your existence. That's not a good argument for getting rid of you, is it?

You might respond that it would be unreasonable to expect you to die because your existence is offensive to me, but then you're making a value judgement about something which you're claiming should lie within my domain, you're saying that my position is invalid and yours is not, which is essentially you elevating yourself and your opinions above my own.

&gt;The law should be blind to the content contained in expression

The law should not be blind to intent.

&gt;Again, you're equivocating two different things. As explained, and perhaps not surprisingly for someone so strongly in favour of rights, I'm big in favour of absolute equality between all moral actors. The persecution and subjugation of minorities was the systematic use of force to remove rights, force labour, and in general physical abuse.

I can't remember when we were run by robots or computers. this clearly brief spell of our history seems to have escaped me. You seem to be labouring under the impression that the modes and operations of a system somehow exist separate to the attitudes and beliefs of the society that creates, runs and benefits from said system.

&gt;Which theory? I simply explained that change occurs over time with shifting attitudes which can be brought about with education and shared cultural experiences and time together.

Your theory that this happened without prompting or the same social engineering you now deem surplus. You didn't just happen upon racial egalitarianism all on your own. society as a whole all around you made it clear the views held by your Gran were unacceptable and in some case made it clear the opposite would land you in trouble in some way. Your life was spent complying in one way or another and having your thoughts shaped to fit in. Pretending it just happened on it's own now is silly.


**LETS TALK ABOUT YOU**

You're an atheist I see. Why subscribe to the subreddit? Why not hold your lack of religious belief in your head and never mention it? Why mention it at all?

Here's you on a man that ""believes"" gays should be killed:

&gt;[This man thinks gays should be killed for being gay, and hence I think he should be killed for his beliefs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/n2bni/nigerian_scholar_seeks_death_penalty_for/c35qfen?context=3)

Now why should you wish harm on him for simply stating his belief? That flies in the face of your thoughts on freedom of speech. Or, like me do you actually believe that freedom of speech ends where that speech expresses the need to remove others freedom? That's why you are an ""active"" atheist. You see the danger in the spread of religion and work to spread another way. in other words you recognise the ability for mere thoughts and ideas to manifest themselves into ugly results in the real world. Where a country full of Christians and Muslins would mean a gay man would see his rights and feeling of safety curbed, I as an ethnic minority feel and country full of people who see me as sub human would do the same for me. your belief that if people were allowed to spread this hate no harm or foul would come about is just naive and frankly insensitive. It isn't your fight so you don't really care.

Sorry, but a lot of people are weak willed. Even if they in their heart HATE black people, they don't usually act on it for fear they will be judged harshly by their peers and the society at large that they want to be part of.

Sorry to Godwin this up, but the majority of Germans were quite in agreement with getting rid of Jews. A majority should not be permitted to persecute or legislate against a belief based or non-chosen attribute based minority.

&gt;So while you disagree with the responses I provided to my hypothetical situations it doesn't really matter, because most reasonable people would not.

Again, I talk of morality. Most people do not hold any developed, hence why we have laws and legislators.

&gt;The law in question has been used on many occasions to successfully prosecute offenders so essentially until you can muster up enough support for your marginal, fringe viewpoint that is exactly what it will remain.

Essentially yes. The struggle for freedom of speech is just like the struggle for the end of slavery, for the woman's vote, or for the end of racial segregation.

This is why we have these things called checks and balances. To hold leaders accountable and to ensure that the public are still largely happy with the laws that leaders implement.

You could just as easily argue that a society that emphasises harmony is morally superior to a society that emphasises individual freedom, because in the former, the incentive exists to do that which benefits a greater number of individuals.

Indeed, why should you respect the law at all when they dont bow and scrape and do exactly what you want them to, which is probably to stop searching your house / uncuff you?

I was pretty much expecting that kind of entitled thinking, at least from the rioters.

The suggestion that stop and search should avoid targetting the chap going to the gym and instead be targetted at the chap carrying a knife made me weep for the labour party - how do you propose the police determine which is which? My suggestion would be some kind of process where someone could be stopped on the street, and searched for a weapon.

We have an odd relationship with the police in this country, we expect them to do everything, solve all ills (paxman having a go at ian blair about the lack of education was quite funny) and if they get it wrong then my god we want heads to roll. Policing by consent is great, but policing still has to happen if that consent is withdrawn.

As a country we need to consider carefully what we want from our police forces, do we want the hands off approach and bobbies on bicycles - or would we prefer that our police act more ""robustly"", in which case we need to back them up.

Appart from his goal scoring capabilities he seems to be willing to move on from is current club, possibly favoring the premier league where I believe he would fit in.

I see him leading the attack with suarez playing off of him.  He also can be played on the left or right (more used on the left) which gives us a little extra options to find a team that starts to click well.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Once again, and not to belabour the point...my VERY FIRST COMMENT was a statement disagreeing with jailing this woman.

That's fair enough, I had missed that. I tend to respond to a specific thing within a post and because I've argued with multiple people in this thread, haven't kept track everything said and who said it.

&gt;Your theory that this happened without prompting or the same social engineering you now deem surplus.

Prompting and social engineering can be done without violation of rights. Education and altered social attitudes can come about through a shared desire for improvement and for change - not only through jailing people for saying things we disagree with. I never pretended it happened on its own, I just disagree with the idea that jailing people for saying things is a necessary or moral way of changing attitudes.

&gt;You're an atheist I see. Why subscribe to the subreddit? Why not hold your lack of religious belief in your head and never mention it? Why mention it at all?

Ignoring the fact that I don't really read r/atheism anymore because it's gone a bit poo - I discuss atheism because I think the nature of belief is interesting.

&gt;Now why should you wish harm on him for simply stating his belief? 

I don't wish him harm for stating his belief, I wish him dead for holding his belief. He could never express it with words, yet if he truly is compelled by his system to murder gays for being gay, then he violates the golden rule.

&gt;Or, like me do you actually believe that freedom of speech ends where that speech expresses the need to remove others freedom?

Expression never achieves anything there though, only action. It's action I disagree with, not expression.

&gt;in other words you recognise the ability for mere thoughts and ideas to manifest themselves into ugly results in the real world.

They can manifest themselves into actions, yes. Although the reason for my stronger than usual support of atheism is because religion tends to bring about sloppy, irrational thinking, and an over reliance on bronze age desert justice.

&gt;your belief that if people were allowed to spread this hate no harm or foul would come about is just naive and frankly insensitive.

People here are extremely critical about the riots, and the damage done to property.   Why are these women not held up to the same standard when they attack another human being .   


If you drink and drive, there is no excuse that you could not handle your alcohol.  Why does the judge  make this exception for religion?  As another Muslim pointed out - if they are Muslim they would not be drinking.


Criminal behaviour should be punished - and the courts should not give different sentences because of race and religion and social class.   That is where the trouble starts.  A sense of injustice.

That said, it is fucking appalling that the judge allowed 'inexperience' with alcohol to mitigate the sentence. Unacceptable. I am firstly sceptical of whether it was these womens' first time drinking; who gets absolutely plastered at a bar or club for their **first time** then goes out harassing people? Even if it was, it's a standard rule that a drunken act is still blameworthy, and I completely fail to see why their bieng muslim changes that in the slightest.

If a secular teetotaller did something like this, 4 people kicking a half scalped woman repeatedly, I seriously doubt there would be any leniency.

This survey was broader reaching than just those who were prosecuted.  I think the suggestion is that the police went after known criminals when working out who to charge, which is hardly surprising.

I also think the inquest is important because if we don't have one, we've learnt nothing.  It will happen again and again and again and we'll keep saying it is just scum bags or criminality or whatever this weeks particular and we'll be no better off.

Instead an inquiry could come up with ways that we can improve the underlying social issues of the rioters so that they're less likely to do it again and ways of policing it better so that its impact isn't as severe.

Just saying...  oh wait Moffat has already lead us to believe that.  And more importantly has completely screwed his own story by saying that the Doctor in the Impossible Astronaut was over 200 years older than the Doctor in Season 5, only to have the Doctor NOT progress 200 years in episodes (I was ready to have the answer to The Impossible Astronaut take a few seasons to get to, and he wraps it up in one (meh).  

Would be nice if he would stop writing himself into a hole and then materializing a ladder that's infinitely long so that he can climb out of it.

I think he has cool ideas sometimes - I just wish he would commit to them and carry out the details the way he establishes them in the first place.  He has huge story-lines and then chops them short because he wants to have a neat season ending.

His work rate is poor, he jogs around and never appears to bomb forward and exert himself to get on the end of a cross in the box.  
Aggers got a rocket of a left foot, it doesnt warrant him a place in liverpools starting lineup as a centre forward. He's 22, what about that makes him more deserving than a 30yr old Maxi who is in better form?

Now heres a few reasons why he shoulnt be in the starting lineup.
1. Constantly falling over, 
2. Too slow, can barely turn around, let alone get on the end of a through or loose ball.
3. Poor touch.
4. Havent seen him show much ability in the air since he arrived, constantly beaten to the ball in the air by defenders, which is mind boggling considering its meant to be his biggest attribute.
5. Slows down the play too much.

I'd like to point out i've been behind andy from the start, but now i can no longer back him as i've lost patience. He's had a lot of undeserved time on the pitch, where he hasnt shown what he's supposedly capable of, and not taken his opportunities.

He goes off and unsuccessfully tries to find Melody. The prequel to *Let's Kill Hitler* has the Doctor on the verge of tears, knowing that he has once again broken a promise to Amy.


&gt;*How and when did they get back to Earth?*

I'm going to assume that you mean Amy and Rory, and I'll point out that that was explained in the dialogue. River got to Demons Run using her Vortex Manipulator, and the Doctor asks River to 'get them home' before he runs off back into the TARDIS.

&gt;*how did they go from being surrounded by The Silence to individually being hunted down in various parts of the country some months later?*

By escaping from the Silence, and using their connection to the President to have them hunted down to 'avoid suspicion' while they research the creatures? It's not 100% clear, I'll give you that, but there's enough expositional dialogue to give a general idea as to what happened during those 3 months on the run.

&gt;*[RTD] wouldn't be obsessed with confusing his audience with ""WTF?!"" moments like this.*

Seriously? I'd say *The Last of the Time Lords*, *Journey's End* and *The End of Time* are absolutely brimming with total 'WTF?"" moments, many of which far surpass Moffat's fairly out-there ideas. Really, the only time the Moff has surpassed the sheer confusing WTF-ness of the ""Gollum Doctor"", the ""Aborted Regeneration"" or the ""Master Race"" is when we had the ""One Shark Open Sleigh"" in *A Christmas Carol*.

The journalist that wrote this just wanted to have his report published and made up the whole thing! In the end it did reduce our carbon footprint and all the students said that they wanted to have more jumper days. We are an eco friendly school and its just in our nature.

 .

&gt;My daughter goes to Ansford, Year 10, and attended 'Jumper Day'. She has just read this article and finds it ridiculous. She had a good day and is looking forward to the next one. During the summer they even turn off all the electricity to really understand the dependency we all have on powered devices. I'm really disappointed to read articles like this. I'm certain there were one or two students that didn't enjoy the experience. Probably the kids that forgot to bring in their jumpers. And yet everyone knew what to expect. But to sensationalise it like this is uncalled for. Mind you, I suppose no one is interested in positive news, like environmental awareness. Ansford is a remarkable school. Both my nephew, and now my daughter have gone their. My son will be going in a couple of years time. They employ great staff that really are passionate about getting through to the kids. If you are going to mature as a journalist, maybe you should look for balance in your articles.
