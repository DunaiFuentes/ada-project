Things that have confirmed this for my self were Meireles and Suarez coming on for Carroll and Kuyt against Arsenal, and Carroll coming on for Raul when he got injured.  


Also, I had a feeling that Henderson's position was never under threat from Raul. Henderson is much more fluid than Raul in terms of he can play on the wing or in the center of the field. (I'm not saying Meireles can't play there. I'm saying Kenny doesn't see him as a CMF). I honestly do believe that Henderson will get dropped but only when Gerrard is back and running. That will be his position I believe.  


That makes me reach the conclusion that Bellamy is in fact Meireles's replacement and not just a back up striker. I think we'll see Bellamy being deployed in the same manner that Raul was deployed this season.""

Comolli deserves a lot of credit for all the work that went into moving players out.  The first team is much more streamlined and that will only help the Academy and reserves transition players into the first team.  It should also help the coaching staff and Comolli assess individual players and the squad as a whole.  And that will lead to better transfers in the future.  The squad is still incomplete for the ambitions of the seasons ahead.  Stewart Downing needs a younger deputy as well as a right footed counterpart.  As well as an attacking midfielder that can can play through the middle, wide and just behind the strikers is paramount for a title challenge and Champions League football.  The better Liverpool plays the more teams will be happy to sit back and defend against us and there aren't many technically gifted dribblers to break that type of game down in the squad at the present.  Someone could come from the youth setup but the best players there are still young and probably a few years from making a consistent impact at the senior level.  The league looked ripe for that taking at the end of last season but the Manchester clubs did enough to make themselves prohibitive favorites.  But Chelsea and Arsenal have not.  Arsenal have spent this summer as they should have the summer before and will find it hard to compensate for the loss of Samir Nasri and Cesc Fabregas.

Suarez can play behind the striker, but I find him better as the out-and-out striker. In any case, he will be asked to do both, and that will take a toll on him physically, especially when you consider the fact that he has not had much rest over the summer. 

Downing too can play behind the striker, but that leaves our left wing empty. 

That leaves Henderson and Jonjo. Henderson has been played on the right so far, and has yet to get a chance to impress in a more central position for Liverpool. Jonjo has not impressed me at all in the games that I've seen him play. I'm not knocking either of them, they may well develop into very good players, but this is early times. 

The problems, if you want to call them that, that I listed are more for the future than for now. Our squad is pretty good enough for this season, considering we are not in Europe. Next season, however, will be very different if we do get the Top 4 spot (and I don't see why we won't). Gerrard is getting old, and we need to start looking for more replacements for him at the end of the season than just Henderson and Jonjo.

By next season, Carra will be out, and Skrtel will become a backup if Coates lives up to his reputation/potential. This leaves the space to sign one more centre-back.

This Attacking Midfield position being a problem now Aqualani and Meireles is gone doesn't exist imo. We play 4-2-3-1, or a slight variation of that. In majority of games Big Andy will be the 1 up top, which means the Attacking Midfield position, is the support striker position which = Suarez in most matches. So in the Attacking mid/Support striker role (which we only have 1 space for) we have Suarez and Gerrard who can both play that role at the very highest standard. We also have Shelvey/Henderson who can step in there who are very promising players along with Bellamy(who in 09/10 was one of citys best players) or with a slight change of frmn we can change to 2 up top and put kuyt up there.

Muller/Hazard - Either would be an amazing buy. I'd prefer Hazard, and I also think Hazard is more realistic. I'm just hoping Lille get knocked out of the champs league so we can try for him in January :D, but that's just me in dreamland.

Food is relatively cheap. You have to put in some effort to eat and drink 20 GBP per day - Marks &amp; Spencer has great food deals that can feed 2 people (including a bottle of wine) for 10 GBP to give you a feel for how much you'll be paying for dinner. I'd say typically myself and my wife both spend about 4 GBP on lunch (I like crepes and the covered market has a nice place) per head and then 5 GBP on dinner per head... that's a relatively meager 9 GBP per day.

Depending on where you stay you -might- need to use a bus (though I'd recommend getting a bike). This will be a few pounds added. Then lets throw in starbucks or whatever else you might want to drink and you're probably around 15 GBP per day and you'll be eating and traveling in what I'd consider great comfort (not sure if you'll have access an oven though - this depends on the housing).

One of the greatest things from the university is the network though, so you should expect to sit at various pubs quite a bit. This can be reasonably cheap at places like the Oxford Union (1.5 GBP per pint IIRC) or your colleges MCR, but it'd be healthy to budget a further 5 GBP per day for that.

Sooo... 20 GBP per day seems quite reasonable really, though a 'fun' budget on top of that might make sense - there's tons and tons of stuff to do here, and if you're just staying for 1-2 years you'll feel like an idiot if you keep having to pass on it because you can't afford the occasional 50 GBP ticket.",0,1314873785,null,0,false,0,c2gq448,t3_k142u,t1_c2gq448,t3_k142u,1427545449,3,false,oxford,t5_2rc7b,3

For me, I'm just not a fan of 11. He's a hipster, he's steampunk, and he feels like an exploitation of geek chic. 

That said, Matt Smith is an amazing Doctor. He'll probably go down in history as one of the absolute best. He's already in the top... 5 or 6. There have been occasions where I recall an episode and think about how awesome the Doctor was in it, believing the whole time that the Doctor was Tennant, but when I look up the episode, I discover it was Smith. If he can cause my memories to think that he was my favorite Doctor, he's got to be doing something absolutely right.

Additionally, I'm actually not 100% in love with Moffett, which is another unpopular opinion to have here. Every time I see the word Moffucked, a little vomit comes up to my throat. He is very considerate, he makes references and takes story arcs back to the classic series without running the Cybermen and the Daleks every other week like RTD did, and his storylines and characters are filled with depth. My problem with it is that in a lot of the ways, the stories depend too much on one-another. Of course, that's also a sign of how things are with TV nowadays, but there was a time that you could watch a 4-episode story arc of Doctor Who and get the whole story. Today, you have to watch multiple seasons and you still end up with plotholes and questions. 

I couldn't stand that about LOST and the idea that it has embedded itself into Doctor Who is something I consider to be a real shame.

Eccleston was a real break from the classic Doctors (though he was somewhat of a logical progression as the show had been getting grittier towards the end of Mccoy and was still somewhat in that direction in the (accursed) tv movie). I thought Tennant was a bad miscalculation at first. Turns out they just gave him a really weak intro (You gotta admit, Christmas Invasion was pretty fucking terrible.), and I really came to love him as the Doctor, pretty much right along with everyone else. However, while many people became convinced that Tennant was the best incarnation *ever*, in the back of my mind I felt something pretty essential to the ""feel"" of Doctor Who was missing from his run. 

When Matt was announced as Eleven, I honestly thought that I might drift away from Doctor Who after 20+ years of fandom. Imagine my surprise when he won me over in about 5 minutes. Now, you can say it might be the writing. And it may have been at first, but his (compared to Tennant's) dialed-down performance, subtle use of timing and expression coupled with the overall excellent production and writing has produced these quotes from me, a 26-year fan of Doctor Who: ""This is the Doctor Who I dreamed about watching as a kid."" (In response to Curse of the Black Spot. Yes I know many hate that episode but it harkened back to the base-under-siege era as well as the fun type of Golden Age Tom Baker stories like Horror of Fang Rock.) and (shocking to many who know me as a lover of old-school Who) ""The Doctor's Wife, to a fan, might just be the best episode of Doctor Who *ever*."" *Blink* may be almost perfection in terms of an episode of great television, but The Doctor's Wife is just amazing *Doctor Who*.

I love Smith. I loved Tennant, but I don't miss him as many seem to. He had a great run and did a great job. He passed the torch to an actor who I had serious reservations about, but is doing a wonderful, dare I say it, even better job. Long live Doctor Who!

I spent £3200 over my nine-months, not including rent, tuition or flights.  That works out to about £12 per day for food and miscellaneous costs.  I was fortunate, since my MPhil (Mathematics) didn't require any textbooks - if you need to buy a lot of books that will add to your costs.

Here are some ways to be thrifty:

1) Flights.  Air Transat and Thomas Cook both offer return flights from Pearson to London Gatwick for around $700 CAD (£450).  The luggage limits are absurdly strict, but it is a lot cheaper.
2) Banking.  Set up a Lloyds account once you're in Oxford.  They're the only bank I found that offers a no-fee international student account.
3) Biking.  Get a bike, it's faster and cheaper than using the local buses.  Motorists in Oxford and Cambridge are very considerate of cyclists, I ride there all the time but I would never risk cycling on Toronto roads.
4) Eat in college.  I know you said your college food looked unappetizing, but it is actually cheaper than cooking on your own.  My college had ordinary lunches or dinners for £2.25 each, and formal dinners for £10 once a week.  You can't buy your ingredients for £2.25 unless you're cooking for several people (buying in bulk in hard since fridge space is usually very sparse).  You definitely can't eat out for £10 at all, much less a meal of the quality of college formal halls.
5) Buy as much as you can while you're still in Canada.  Clothing, linens and such are more expensive (replace the $ with a £ sign, but leave the sticker price the same).

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"Nice post. A couple of points I'd like to make about Meireles:

1. When Gerrard's back and as Henderson matures, Meireles would have little chance of starting. I would have liked to keep him around as an impact sub; he's clever enough to play with any formation and personnel and really helped change the game against Arsenal. I'm not sure that's worth turning down £12M though.
2. My reading of the transfer request thing is that LFC said to him *""Chelsea aren't offering as much cash as we want; you can go there if you want but only if you write a transfer request so as to forgo the loyalty payment""*. It's my understanding that players who are sold without submitting a request get huge ""loyalty"" payments that they're not entitled to if they hand in the request. That's why Alonso waited so long before handing in his request, because he wanted to engineer a transfer without one first and keep his payment. Admittedly I don't know this to be true, but I'm reading Meireles as having basically done the opposite of Alonso's dick move, and given up some cash to allow his transfer to go ahead. I could be wrong.
3. I think Gerrard is the attacking midfielder you're looking for. Bellamy can also play in pretty much any attacking position.

On Joe Cole, it seems ridiculous that we'll be paying him £3M to sit in Lille's treatment room, but I guess that's better than paying £5M for him to sit in ours. I read that Aston Villa came in with a offer for him after the Lille deal was done — why the hell would they wait until the last day? They knew he was for sale all summer. 

Future signings:

I heard we also tried to get Adam Johnson from Man City; if he doesn't get into their team between now and Xmas he might move in January. And that has to be a pretty hard team to break into! He might be the Kuyt replacement we need.

I think in the modern game a team only needs one ""proper"" winger on the pitch, with the guy on the other side tucking in more. Downing's the first real winger we've had since I don't know when (Walters?) and it's amazing how much difference he makes. He uses the width very intelligently, staying wide when we need that out ball and tying the whole opposition defence in knots when he drags his full-back into the center circle. I don't want to ever see Liverpool play without a player like that ever again - it's been too long. So I agree, we need another genuine winger in the squad.

I think at times we've had too many disaffected players who all came to Liverpool to play in behind the striker(s) and are stuck on the bench or out of position when Gerrard is fit. I think Dalglish is aiming to have a faster, more fluid front 6 than Benitez's Liverpool (in fact, perhaps a lot more like Benitez's Valencia) and also not rely so much on having a purely defensive holding midfielder. Lucas plays in a much more advanced position than did Rafa's central midfelders, and I think this means that the gap between midfield and attack isn't quite the yawning gulf that it's been at times. I'm not sure we really need too much depth in the ""hole"" position beyond what we have, although I might rue Shelvey going out on loan if Gerrard doesn't get fit.",0,1314884238,null,0,false,0,c2gqr0o,t3_k0xqs,t1_c2gqr0o,t3_k0xqs,1427545739,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I've read a few different opinions of why the Doctor stopped using guns and there are a number of reasons ranging from particular actors disliking guns to BBC wanting to keep guns out of the hands of the Doctor. That said, whenever the issue of guns comes up, people with them always seem to be looked down upon, which is not my cup of tea.

VDV's injury means a rotation in midfield for a while, but the squad has decent depth with the addition of Parker.

One of the reasons that SG has done so well for us is that he is capable of combining any of the above - most players are more one dimensional though. 

It has, for many years now, been a constant annoyance that we didn't have a plan B to break a team down. In the last few years, lower ranked opposition had our number, defensive numbers and combative, disruptive tactics would frustrate us to the point where we'd get desperate and maybe even leak one. I honestly think Kenny has more guile though, if our creative players are being nullified he knows exactly how to change it up.

true,strolls,null,null,"If I look at the wikipedia pages for the two guys you mention:

* Benn is the current President of the Stop the War Coalition; he renounced his inherited title and was instrumental in the creation of the Peerage Act 1963.
* Skinner may be more colourful, cracking jokes during the Queen's Speech and having been suspending from parliament for the  ""unparliamentary language"" of calling other politicians ""slimy"", a ""wart"" and ""crooked"". He refuses to miss any sitting in the House of Commons, saying that ""if you missed a shift at the pit, you would get the sack"" and also refuses to adopt the pairing system in which he can agree a mutual abstention with a Conservative MP, saying he won't cover for them whilst they ""go swanning off to Ascot or to their boardrooms"".      
However he voted in favour of equalisation of the age of consent, civil partnerships, adoption rights for same-sex couples, and to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. He voted against the Iraq War, against the party line when he voted against government policy to allow terror suspects to be detained without trial for 90 days and voted against government policy to renew the Trident Nuclear Missile System.

So whatever reasons you have for calling them ""nutjobs"", I don't really find them dangerous. I mean, obviously I agree with Skinner's voting record on abortion, but calling someone a nutjob is fairly harmless, and I'm pretty sure that either of these guys can cope with it. It's not going to sully their reputation or prevent me from agreeing with them on policy issues.

Nadine Dorries is trying to tell women what to do with their bodies. That is *not* acceptable, and it is not appropriate that someone with such attitudes should contribute to law-making in a democratic society. Saying that ""oh, it's ok, she's just a nutjob"" trivialises that. She represents a threat to freedom, and that's in no way cool.

Dorries is welcome, as far as I'm concerned, to ""enliven politics"" as long as no-one takes her seriously and as long as she's not allowed to vote in Westminster; since she *is* allowed to vote in parliament she becomes a menace and a danger to all of us, and is no longer a mere ""nutjob"".

*EDIT: I have not down-modded you during this thread or, to the best of my knowledge, ever. Although I disagree with your premise that sensible politicians outweigh the likes of Dorries - I think* all *our politicians should be ""sensible"" - I don't see why you're getting downvotes for basically saying that ""nutjobs enliven politics"". I tend to agree with you on that.

So chosen for emphasis on quick breaks, which is how we'll beat the stronger teams and attacking options, which is how we'll beat the weaker teams. Defensively, I think we can expect King to play less than 10 games at all this season, if we're lucky, so Gallas as the senior defensive partner and Dawson seemed to be the best fit together. Moving to midfield, Parker is slightly more mobile on the ball than Hud and also tackles better IMO, but doesn't have quite the awesome range of Tom at full fitness which is why I couldn't split them for their inclusion. Lennon was another tough one to leave out, but his final ball this season hasn't been great, and he needs to prove himself to me again.

true,ephemerat,null,null,"&gt; If you don't know how to make a gun, firepower is intelligence.

Yes, but rarely an issue for most of the Doctor's opponents. ;)

&gt; I suppose as an American gun-owner fan of the show since the new series started, I had always thought the Doctor was anti-gun, but discovered that the Doctor stopped using guns when the British bans were being put in place.

As far as I am aware (and from memory) the Doctor has almost never used weapons from the show's inception - this was not some sudden change due to the bans. [Here's a wiki article](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Firearm) on the use of firearms in the series that demonstrates the rare occasions when a gun has been in his hands - and I'd usually put those down to the show's notoriously patchy writing rather than any illustration of his fundamental (although changeable) character. There was a period during the Third Doctor when the show tried to emulate the success of *The Avengers* when he was much more martial (and barely travelled around space or time) but this seems more of an aberration in the show's long history.

From what I've read, there were several reasons for this decision but one of the primary ones was an attempt to do something different than the mass of other science fiction (British included) in which force of arms was always what carried the day. Also writers have stated that, for a show that tries to be scary, having someone walk into the haunted house with only their wits to defend them is a much more effective method to generate atmosphere. 

&gt;That said, whenever the issue of guns comes up, people with them always seem to be looked down upon, which is not my cup of tea.

I understand your defensiveness, as an English guy who grew up with the chance to regularly use air rifles and shotguns on farms and has enjoyed the use of other firearms (in safely controlled areas) subsequently, but I found your claim that much of these creative decisions came from a squeamishness around guns due to the 'anti-gun climate' in Britain to be rather hollow given the portrayal of many of our other most iconic fictional figures: Just look at James Bond (amongst many others).

The Doctor has always been the unparalleled academic, barrelling around the universe, disdaining swords and guns in favour of his prodigious intellect and I think that's what gives him his idiosyncratic flavour.

So basically our only attack will come from the left side making things kind of predictable. What could work is that Lampard and Meireles will throw a long ball up to drogba, who will have the option to pass to a breaking ramires and torres, or ship it off the mata who crosses over t torres or takes it himself.

true,ChrisAndersen,null,null,"Regeneration occurs in multiple stages.

1. Initiation: A traumatic event occurs that the bodies natural healing processes cannot repair (Time Lords seem to be resilient even without regeneration). The Time Lord can tell when this happens and knows that once it starts it can only be delayed, not stopped (thus giving 10  time to go and ""collect his reward"").

2. Transition: the glowing hands is a clear signal that the actual regeneration cannot be held off any longer. Within minutes the Time Lords body goes through a complete cellular regeneration that literally replaces every single cell of their body with new cells. This doesn't just mean that their physical appearance changes but also their brain chemistry. This is why different generations of The Doctor can have different mannerisms even if he still has the same memories and, for lack of a better word, ""soul"".

3. Stabilization: this is an extended period after transition where the new body is trying to settle down. During this period, the body has healing powers almost as powerful as regeneration itself. Wounds instantly heal, limbs regrow, and even some minor physical changes can be manifested.

It is during the Transition phase that a Time is most vulnerable. If they are attacked at that time they can be killed before the cycle completes. Melody/River is shot during the Stabilization phase, so she is safe. The Doctor in the first episode of season 6 has just started to enter the Transition phase, so he was vulnerable.

Anyway, that's my read on it. An interesting question I have is just how much control a Time Lord has over the Transition phase.

Beat shit out of the last living time-lord, then spent 2000 years as plastic, protecting a box with his girlfriend in it. Do not... fuck... with the Last Centurian. He'll fuck you up.

It's only after repeated viewings that I can start to judge whether the story was any good to begin with.

In this study, they appear to have given their subjects really good stories to begin with and knowing the twist meant that they could appreciate the story for what it was while the people who didn't know the twist were distracted by it.

true,namesaremptynoise,mccoy,McCoy,"You're probably going to get as many different opinions on this as you get replies...  But I figured I'd toss my .02 in.

There's a *huge* change in the character from 10 to 11, in a lot of ways the difference is much more shocking than a lot of transitions have been(Except maybe 4-5, where you went from judo-chopping, scarf-boloing, Dalek-destroying Doctor to a near-complete pacifist).  There are *always* differences of course, as well there should be, but it's a lot harder to draw paralells between 10 and 11 than there are, say, between 9 and 10(which makes sense considering different lead producer and such).  

As FedoraLa pointed out: early on, it seems like Smith comes off a lot more as someone trying to act like the Doctor than really *being* the Doctor.  It also seemed to me that they were trying too hard to give him epic moments for things that weren't really that epic(and they were *really* over using the Epic Doctor Music).  Also, a big factor for me was the companion(which I know we disagree on) I *hate* Amy Pond.  *Hate*, *hate*, *hate*, **hate** her.  I was really discouraged throughout most of Season 5, I kept up with it though because I've been a Whovian ever since I was a little kid and it's going to take a lot to make me give up on the show(the movie was an abomination, but I was still excited enough to fanboy squee when I heard it was coming back).

All that being said...  For me, it steadily started getting better again near the end of season 5, and by about halfway through the second episode of Season 6 I'd finally made my peace with him.  I won't spoil the specific moment, but he did something(not even the climax of the episode) that made me finally nod, grin, and say ""There he is.  That's the Doctor.""  

I'm still not a huge fan of the Moffat era so far, I have issues here and there with the way Moffat ass-pulls things from time to time, and I can't help but sigh at anyone who thinks production values should have any bearing on a discussion of how good the show is.  I've watched and greatly enjoyed episodes where the villain was an actor covered in old ducting parts or a bag made out of bubble-wrap full of green-dyed corn syrup.  Not to mention Omega(who I want to make another appearance someday) and his paper-mache head.  

For me it has been, is, and always will be about three things.  The writing, the companions, and the Doctor himself.  For the Moffat era, the writing tends to be *very* hit or miss for me, when it's on the top of its game, it's awesome, when it's not, it can get very *meh* very fast.  Some people complain that they don't like these big half-season or season-long arcs, I personally like them, it feels more like the old series to me.  I still don't like Amy, but I don't hate her with the same passion I used to, and the other companion from Series 6 is probably one of my favorites and...  well...  Smith's still not my favorite, and probably never will be (McCoy forever, with Tennant, Baker and Eccleston all close behind), but he's the Doctor now, I've grown as attached to him as I always do, and I don't doubt I'll at least get a little misty-eyed when his time is up.",0,1314902232,null,0,true,0,c2gt5ix,t3_k0w63,t1_c2gt5ix,t3_k0w63,1427546944,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

 &gt; Tara Woods, 22, went to the 99p Store in Sandgate Road on Tuesday, August 16, and bought her two-year old Frankie Orris a meat and potato Tindale and Stanton pasty for his lunch.

 &gt; But as he took his first bite she noticed the sell-by date was August 13 – three days before her visit to the store.

 &gt; Hussein Lalani, commercial director for the chain, confirmed an investigation was being held as to how the out-of-date pasty was sold.

 &gt; He said: ""If in this case we are in the wrong then we apologise profusely and a full investigation is being held as to why we sold the out-of-date pasty.""

 &gt; Miss Woods, a single mum of two who lives in Holywell Avenue, said: ""I was absolutely disgusted.

 &gt; ""I grabbed it out his mouth and threw it on the floor but he'd already swallowed.

 &gt; ""I went in straight away and demanded to see the manager. Eventually some guy came out the back and when I showed him the receipt and the packaging he offered me a £5 gift voucher for the store, which I declined.

 &gt; ""I said I'd phone head office and left but Frankie was ill during the next night.

 &gt; ""He was all right thankfully but I didn't get any sleep for worry.

 &gt; ""I believe it was caused by the bite he had taken.""

 &gt; Miss Woods went back to the store the next day but was again offered a £5 voucher.

 &gt; She said: ""I'll never shop there again.

 &gt; ""It was horrible but I'm just relieved I noticed the sell-by date on the packaging or he might have eaten it all.""

true,WhyAmINotStudying,null,null,"I recently watched the entire series and he was shooting quite a bit up until Peter Davison. He wasn't shooting in every episode, or even every serial, but seeing the Doctor pick up a gun wasn't out of the ordinary. 

Guns have been all over the show, from the French Revolution to Torchwood, and UNIT was loaded with guns, of course. Hell, Tom Baker gave Max Stael a gun to use for his suicide when the Fendahl had him trapped. That may have been one of the last times I saw the Doctor hold a gun without being judgmental of the culture of guns.

Also, I'm certainly no Doctor, but I don't see that an intelligent person should put their limit at a gun. Of course, the Doctor has been getting more physically agile and active, with the exception of Sylvester McCoy, since Tom Baker's reign, so he can do more running and physical actions in places of using a gun. 

Another thing that really seemed weird was how much his character is tied to the sonic screwdriver, but in the classic series, the Second and Fourth Doctors were really the only ones who ever used it. Of course, I love the sonic screwdriver as a device to move the plot forward, so I'm not complaining about it.

His short passing, ball retention and movement were all significantly better than they were 6 months ago. If we can give him a decent amount of first-team play, he could turn into a very good player for us.

Also because the voice doesn't have that tinny quality for that line.  All the other lines, when you see the hologram and it is being blunt and pedantic, the voice has a tinny sound.  Then it cuts away and the fish fingers and custard line is delivered *without* the tinny sound.  I might be remembering it wrong, but the hologram went from translucent to solid when it cuts back to the shot of her biting her lip too.

Doesn't seem to make sense (the real Amelia popping out of nowhere to inspire him?) but too many little things all switching at that exact moment for it to be a production quirk, seems intentional.  Feels like a jacket in the forest scene all over again.

true,namesaremptynoise,mccoy,McCoy,"The rules tend to change depending on who's writing, who's producing, and what's required by the given script...  But usually there are three major points that come into play when you're trying to change the past in the Whoniverse.

1. The Grandfather Paradox - If something happened to you that caused you to go back in time specifically to change that... You can't.  [spoiler](/s ""Which is why the Doctor couldn't go back after Madame le Pompadour died in 'Girl in the Fireplace' or why he couldn't go back to get little Ameliah after he'd already met adult Amy."")  Because if you go back in time to change it, it didn't happen, so there was no reason to go back in time and change it, so it did happen, so you went back in time to change it, so it didn't happen, so there was nothing to change, so you didn't go back in time...  Paradox.

2. Fixed Points - This has to do with the Web of Time, I won't get too deep into the lore here (since most of it is from Classic) but basically there are certain events like the Holocaust, Pompeii, humanity's first interstellar flight, etc, that **must** happen, or the Web unravels, which would be very, very bad.  (Of course, the Web was originally laid by Rassilon and the central anchor point was the Eye of Harmony, and the major responsibility of the Timelords was its upkeep, so some fans like myself think it may be unravelling even now.)

3. You can't cross your own timeline - You can't go back and interact with yourself, not ever.  That's why [spoiler](/s ""River couldn't be there at the battle of Demon's Run for instance until little Melody was gone."")

It's the first one that may cause an issue with getting baby Melody back now.  Arguably on the one hand she insinuated that they didn't find her as a baby, so it'd be a Grandfather Paradox.  On the other hand, they'd already committed to finding her *before* she told them that, so maybe it's not.  Hard to say for certain, but what we *do* know is that Mels(who wasn't the same child that Melody regenerated into the first time) is going to go find them when she's a child and grow up with them, then try to kill the Doctor.  So even if they *do* find her, that's still going to happen, which means either she'll get kidnapped again or that'll all be in her head as some kind of sleeper programming.",0,1314914777,null,0,true,0,c2guwst,t3_k1rbd,t1_c2guwst,t3_k1rbd,1427547762,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

If you're going to advocate the continuing of prohibition, perhaps you could kindly point out one occassion in history where it worked? Then please tell me why cannabis is somehow different. Then consider that it causes a whopping zero deaths per year, compared with paracetamol's 130 and alcohol's 33,000. Then please explain why it's any of your damn business what people choose to do provided they harm no-one else?

But no, cannabis is bad, evil, wrong and illegal because it's bad, evil, wrong and illegal, right? Alcohol is fine because it's taxed and been used for thousands of years (it's not like cannabis use goes back at least 12,000 years or anything). Isn't arbitrary morality fun?

Maybe you could use a little educating on the origins of the war on drugs:

&gt;""You have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to.""

\- Nixon

&gt;""Marijuana makes a nigger think he's as good as a white man.""

&gt;""There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.""

\- Harry J. Anslinger, Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 1930

It was for bullshit reasons then and it's for bullshit reasons now.

You've been fighting the war on drugs for decades. Drugs won. We need harm minimisation now, unless you're just arbitrarily wanting to punish people for having fun, in which case, you're a dick. For heroin, that means prescriptions and rehab. For cannabis, it means leaving users alone. The draconian penalties do more harm than the drug itself, which is ridiculous.

Seriously, what are you trying to accomplish? Are you *really* trying to rehabilitate drug users into functional members of society by putting them in prison (where there are even more drugs), thus exposing them to *actual* criminals (you know, people who actually *hurt* people) and giving them a police record that will eliminate them from all but the hottest, noisiest and worst-paid jobs, therefore pushing them towards criminality? Why would you possibly think that would work? It's insane.

To quote Bill Hicks, they might be sick, but prison isn't going to cure them - you'd come out of prison wanting to shoot heroin into your fucking eyeballs.

true,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,tardis,TARDIS,"Well-spotted indeed!  A couple of not very big nitpicks that I can think of:

Firstly, if the Doctor spent thirty-two minutes in the company of his loved ones at Lake Silencio, he would have literally zero time to do *anything* but go there; even firing off a quick message on his voxy thing would surely shave off a minute or two (hell, his banter with the voice interface really should have featured her ticking down to thirty-one minutes, it went on long enough).  Still, we only know that it was thirty-two minutes from their *appointed* meeting to his death, so perhaps they were running late (I don't have the ep handy to check).

Secondly, if he went straight from here to his death then the Doctor who said that he's significantly older is *this Doctor right here in the episode*.  There's no time for him to get any older in thirty-two minutes.  Either he did all of that adventuring in his absence before this episode and didn't get a chance to say 'cor blimey it's been ages' to Amy and Rory (possible, what with the Mel invasion) or... he lied (probable, what with Rule One).

Neither breaks the scenario even a little bit, of course.  Just stuff that's got me wondering.  Oh, wouldn't it be absolutely twisted if the Doctor *had* been lying about dying in order to get Melody to make the right choice and save Amy and Rory, and she *threw her regenerations away* saving him from a good bluff?  Good thing he was able to save her back in the Library or that might have been a really shit thing to do.  If he did it.

(Speaking of the Library, am I the only one who thinks River -- in her new electronic form -- would find some way to resume galavanting around the universe with her death having only been a minor setback?  If there's anyone save the Doctor clever enough to do it, it's River, and with knowledge being power she's living in what Ten would call the greatest arsenal in the world!)",0,1314918519,null,0,false,0,c2gvd0k,t3_k1hcq,t1_c2gvd0k,t3_k1hcq,1427547978,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

Then, for whatever plot reason they can come up with, someone manages to revive him in Series 7. My thought is this would be better if no hint of this is seen at the end of Series 6. This is still consistent with what the crew member of the Tesselecta said because the Doctor still actually, really dies at Lake Silencio on 4/22/2011.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Here's a slightly sadder interpretation, spoilers of course...

As far as we know, River has only ever interacted with Eleven...but for this once with Ten. We know that Eleven has many years of adventures with River before he is killed at Lake Silencio.  We know that the killing at the lake appears to be final, but none of us want to believe that the Doctor won't somehow find a way to escape, to fake his death and regenerate and escape his enemies.  We also know that time travelers believe the Doctor died at the lake, and that it is a ""Fixed Point"" that cannot be changed.

Imagine for a minute that they are right.

After years of adventures with the Doctor, River sends out a call and the Doctor that arrives...doesn't look like Eleven.  She thinks to herself ""He did it!  He tricked us all and this is him with a new face trying not to give himself away!  Oh, he has a *lot* of explaining to do!"" ...but when he reveals that he is *not* Eleven, having cheated the Reaper again and gone to Twelve...she's heartbroken.  Rather then try to explain that she thought she had, just maybe, *not* murdered him like she thought, she covers by pretending to be confused about the order.

The only flaw in this interpretation is her demand that he not change anything about their relationship.  I mean, if things are as bleak as I imagine, surely she'd want him to try and dodge the bullet?",0,1314930592,null,0,false,0,c2gwr0h,t3_k1tka,t1_c2gwr0h,t3_k1tka,1427548634,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

I don't think I understand what you mean with the kill the Doctor twice thing - do you mean the Impossible Astronaut and her poison lipstick in LKH?  If you do then for River the poison lipstick came before (in her timeline) the Impossible Astronaut, so she didn't know about it because it hadn't happened yet for her and she didn't know it would happen either.  The Tesselectors knew about it because they are some sort of time travelling agency

The next problem is stating that Mels just appeared as Amy and Rory's best mate.  She hasn't been mentioned before but that doesn't mean she wasn't there. Granted you can say her intro was a bit clumsy but I don't know if that was enough to believe she appeared out of thin air

The problem with taking the what would have happened if Amy and Rory raised Melody route is that if you changed it that much, River/Melody wouldn't exist.  As you said, Mels was the reason Amy and Rory got together.  Also the baby that Amy and Rory would raise wouldn't be River Song since Melody would need to regenerate at least twice to become River.  And it was the Silence/eye-patch lady that manipulated her DNA to the point where Melody could regenerate so there wouldn't even be the possibility of Melody ever becoming River Song

true,Juliano94,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; to teach that [evolution] is what fucking happened? That's indoctrination.

Then we shouldn't teach that 1 plus 1 makes 2. We shouldn't teach that the sun doesn't orbit the earth. We shouldn't teach that the earth is a sphere. Because all that would be indoctrination as well. So we shouldn't actually teach anything.

As to whether evolution is 'true'... It's not something you can just decide whether to believe or not based on lacking knowledge. We know that evolution by natural selection happens as much as we know anything. There is a lot more evidence for it than many other things that we accept as true. If there's anything you don't understand about it you should try getting an experienced biologist to explain it to you before presuming that the theory is flawed. There are disagreements between scientists on the details of how evolution happens, but it cannot be disputed that it happens. I suggest you read some books on the subject if you're interested. 'The Greatest Show On Earth' by Richard Dawkins is a good place to start.

Edit: also you say survival of the fittest is the most obvious thing ever... Well remember it took until the 19th century for it at last to be 'discovered'. It may seem obvious now but it took a very long time for someone to figure it out. And remember that genes are a recent discovery too. Before that, there was no known mechanism for how features were passed on.

You also say that survival of the fittest doesn't always apply. Indeed it doesn't and scientists know that. Evolution is an overall process. On individual cases the 'fittest' may actually be unlucky and reproduce less than a less well adapted rival.

#1.

It goes against what I have been taught. 

That we aren't taught history properly is not limited to Sciences, but also History as a subject. 

Mutation is not seen as a positive effect and leads to breakdown.

Mathematical probability seems to make evolution seem like a joke.

Species have been seen to 'evolve' (what others might term adapt) in spans of say 15 years.

Dating methods are 'reliable' right up to the point that they're found to be unreliable. In other words, it's not easy to put faith into that, compared to say God, who doesn't change.

To reiterate the point above, so much of science is not about truth. Yes, we can rely on many scientific facts to support practical applications, but that doesn't make every scientific fact truth. So what people are really saying, when they say they want their child to learn the truth, is that they want their child to learn popular science, in the faith and hope that those facts turn out to be practically useful and not actually wrong (many of which, as history shows, have turned out to be wrong, and continue to be found wrong).

I have nothing against this method in the slightest, but to trample on people's beliefs for the sake of 'the truth' is exactly the same as book burning. If you ever arrive at such an extreme attitude as the one that considers this petition, just turn the situation around to yourself. Would you want someone else deciding what your kids should learn?

Not quite sure that's right. From my understanding from the events of AGMGTW (and sort of LKH) Melody was a 'child of the TARDIS' being that she was conceived inside the TARDIS/Time Vortex during travel, which is why she has Time Lord DNA, thus able to regenerate.

&gt; Mutation is not seen as a positive effect and leads to breakdown.

You were taught wrong. Mutation is seen in entirely neutral contexts, it is neither explicitly good or explicitly bad. Mutation in DNA can cause absolutely nothing due to the degenerate code, it can cause a protein to become better at its role due to structure and binding site alterations or it can cause a protein to completely fail to function ( As the mutation in cystic fibrosis does to the ion channel). Mutations in biology are neutral, it is their effect on the protein that determines their value as towards the survivability of the species.

&gt; Mathematical probability seems to make evolution seem like a joke.

I don't get this. You can't just link together two concepts without any form of point. How does mathematical probability make evolution a joke? If you're applying simple models to complex and chaotic systems then I can see why, but you've not even shown me that, you've just made a non sequitur.

&gt; Species have been seen to 'evolve' (what others might term adapt) in say spans of 15 years

Yep. Your problem with that being? Evolution is adaptation, its the evolving of a population through genetic not enviromental means and through favoured aspects of random chance. Its not new and considerably different creatures, that's speciation. MRSA was first spotted in 1961 and its infection rates are constantly climbing due to a lack of competition and minimal 'predation'. Its evolved over a short time span.

&gt;Dating methods are 'reliable' right up to the point that they're found to be unreliable. In other words, it's not easy to put faith into that, compared to say God, who doesn't change.

Yes, that's how development works. We find something, thats 'reliable' as it can be and then we find something more reliable. The original methods aren't made any less accurate unless they were completely mistaken, which I won't deny happens rarely, but more often scientific systems are refined. Copernican heliocentrism refined over the decades to provide a better system with complete mistakes (Vulcan to explain Mercuries orbit) but how can you deny that teaching children a technique that is not ashamed to admit error and refine itself and to teach them the merits of refining work is better than a system that plunged humanity into a Dark Age. Although on the whole I think C-14 dating is pretty reliable, I haven't heard any logical arguments against it.

&gt; To reiterate the point above, so much of science is not about truth. Yes, we can rely on many scientific facts to support practical applications, but that doesn't make every scientific fact truth. So what people are really saying, when they say they want their child to learn the truth, is that they want their child to learn popular science, in the faith and hope that those facts turn out to be practically useful and not actually wrong (many of which, as history shows, have turned out to be wrong, and continue to be found wrong).

To an extent I mildly agree here. Teaching the scientific method is far more important than teaching the facts, as is teaching a way to both logically absorb, interpret and convey information. However why teach creationism (which the evidence, which is all we can build our assumptions on shows to be wrong or at best unfeasible) when we can teach Biology, which is a perfect example of the scientific method at work in both Darwins research and the thousands papers that follow it.

&gt;I have nothing against this method in the slightest, but to trample on people's beliefs for the sake of 'the truth' is exactly the same as book burning

No its not, and continue down that road and you'll lose this on a Godwins. Trampling someones beliefs for the sake of truth is not what this is. This is teaching the evidence and not the opinion. The evidence is in evolutions corner. I'm fine with a teacher saying 'There is also creationism, which contains no scientifically tested evidence'. What I am against is scientifically inaccurate (Creationist Museum) portrayals of creationism.

&gt;If you ever arrive at such an extreme attitude as the one that considers this petition, just turn the situation around to yourself. Would you want someone else deciding what your kids should learn? What about a Christian? Probably not right? So how do you think Christian parents feel?

I have to accept someone else decides what my children learn. Its called the national curriculum. My children will be taught books in English I wouldn't teach them, my children will be made to learn Mathematics, Science, History all not determined by me. Its the national curriculum. I expect my Children however to be taught the evidence, not the opinion in the Science and Mathematics classrooms. Creationism is as ridiculous as taking out a big dusty book in maths, saying that 2+2=5 and that despite all the clear logical evidence for 2+2=4 that the 2+2=5 answer should still be considered because its a belief. Beliefs get to a point where they interfere in whats socially and ethically right. How do you feel trampling the belief of a racist, or a bully? If instead children were being taught that black people were inferior in free schools, would you feel this was ok?

&gt;**The Blinovitch Limitation Effect** is a fictional principle of time travel physics in the universe of the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who.

&gt;It is usually understood as having two aspects: firstly, that a time traveller cannot ""redo"" an act that they have previously committed, and secondly, that a dangerous energy discharge will result if two temporal versions of the same person come into contact. The first aspect is similar to a real-world physics conjecture, the Novikov self-consistency principle.

&gt;How the Blinovitch Limitation Effect works has never been made clear by any of the television programme's production teams. It remains a convenient plot device rather than an attempt to rationalise time travel in the Doctor Who universe.

So many people become so awestruck by The Doctor they forget he can be wrong and he does have flaws, and this is also why I think The Doctor thinks of Rory as a true friend. It's good to have a friend who you can trust to be honest about you to your face without malice and I think The Doctor knows how important that is. For Rory, The Doctor is just that really cool guy that knew his girlfriend from before they met (see Mal/Zoe/Wash), then he was away for a while, then he came back out of the blue and now Rory is faced with this amazing other guy that he doesn't know if he should love or hate. And Rory, being Rory, does the brave thing and chooses not to hate this super cool guy that may or may not steal his girlfriend away (see Mickey). 

Rory is a very layered character and I love that you're not clobbered over the head by his character arch like we have been with some other companions. In fact, I think some people miss it entirely. I'm really starting to think that series 6 is all about Rory.

true,namesaremptynoise,mccoy,McCoy,"Alright, to answer this question from the lore that exists...  First of all I need to preface this with sources.  Most of what I'm about to type out here comes from the classic series, some comes from the radio plays, and a few details come from the new virgin adventures.  In terms of canonicity, things from the classic series are canon unless the new series decides they aren't, things from the radio series *can* be canon, or become canon in altered form, and the new virgin adventures are mostly just fluff and possibly alternate universe stuff.  As a final warning, there are going to be some spoilers both for classic and nuWho up ahead, so if you object to that, don't read any further.  That being said...

To understand **what** a Fixed Point in time is, first you must understand **why** a Fixed Point in time is.  Fixed Points in time are the points which support and maintain the overall structure of the Web of Time.  To understand that, we have to go back roughly 2 billion years into the past(from our point of view).  

It starts with quite possibly the two greatest Gallifreyan scientists ever to live.  Omega the Stellar Engineer, and Rassilon the Great.  Omega theorized it would be possible to create a source of limitless energy by collapsing a massive star into a contained singularity, and with Rassilon(a great politician as well as an incredible scientific mind in his own right)'s help, he gained the support necessary to try it.

He was successful in his work, and created what was called the Eye of Harmony(by some accounts it was the very first black hole, but that's very debatable canonically), but in the process he and his ship were sucked into an alternate dimension of antimatter.  However, despite the loss of Omega, the Eye was formed, and became the center of Gallifreyan power.

Utilizing the Eye, it became possible to grow/construct/tame TARDISes, along with the help of the creation of the Rassilon Imprimateur, the third part of the tri-helical Timelord DNA that Rassilon engineered and symbiotically implanted in the rest of his race, giving them some of their extra senses, the ability to regenerate, and the ability to bond with a TARDIS and navigate the Vortex.  

Rassilon was the first of the Time Lords, and he looked forward into all the possible futures(remember, this is 2 billion years ago, the Gallifreyans were one of the first great civilizations in our universe) and started winnowing down all the possibilities, working out what 'future-history' would be most advantageous for his race(Rassilon gets all the credit, but he probably had a fair amount of help from others in this).  

Once he'd worked out exactly what he wanted to happen...  He spun the Web of Time.  Before the Timelords, Time was extremely unstable.  Cause and effect *existed*, but 'wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey ball' doesn't even *begin* to describe how the chronology of the universe was.  We have to get into metaphor here because with our simple monkey brains we can't understand any of the science behind it...  But basically, Rassilon used the power of the Eye of Harmony along with several impossibly powerful devices of his and Omega's creation to forge a set destiny for all of time stretching forward from the moment of the Eye of Harmony's creation out toward the very end of the universe.

This was the Web of Time.  It was not so much an *absolute* chain of events encompassing every action of every sentient being and every movement of every subatomic particle for every picosecond of the rest of existence as it was a mutable ""fabric"" or ""tapestry.""  Small details could change over and over again, and the Web would remain.  You could step on a butterfly in the Triassic and not wipe out all of humankind millions of years in the future, for instance, or you could save a handful of people off the Titanic and, as long as you didn't set them down somewhere that they could tell the rest of humankind about timetravellers, things would still work out according to the Web's pattern.  If something that was more important than taking a different turn or saving one life among thousands happened...  Then the universe, which had had the Web stitched through it, might take its own action to repair things, for instance by closing off the section of spacetime where the change occured and letting the Reapers free to take care of things(or this might be the Web doing it, or the Reapers themselves might have been tasked with such by Rassilon).

However, there *were* certain key things that **had** to happen for the Web to be maintained.  It was centered primarily around three great civilizations.  The Gallifreyans themselves, another civilization far in our future that I can't for the life of me remember the name of...  And humankind itself.  Those three races' histories had to remain more or less stable, or else the Web would start to tear and unravel.

For instance, JFK *had* to be assassinated, because his assassination played a key part in continuing to spur on the space race.  Pompeii *had* to be destroyed, because it affected the culture both back then, and in our contemporary period as it became a huge part of our sciences of archaeology and anthropology.  The Titanic *had* to sink, because it taught us important lessons about engineering and hubris, as well as becoming an important race memory.  Our first interstellar flight *had* to happen at the right point in time, or else we would've run into the wrong race out in the inky depths and been obliterated, or absorbed into their civilization as a servant race, or who knows what.

That's what a Fixed Point in time is.  There are any number of them, each one a key event or chain of events that shaped the future of one of the great civilizations, and thus, the Web of Time itself.  It's hard to say what might be a Fixed Point while it's going on.  It might be something obvious and catastrophic or fantastic, like what I mentioned earlier...  Or it might be something that *seems* innocuous, like the death of one seemingly unimportant individual, or even a bad breakup...  That would shape the life of another person, who would shape the life of *another* person who would then go on to do something massively important to the Web.  The only ones who can really know a Fixed Point are the Timelords and other time-sensitive beings.  [spoiler](/s ""To answer your question about how the Justice Department knows what are Fixed Points...  I honestly don't know, and I'm very curious to find that out, as well as how they know so much about the Doctor and his TARDIS. ...It concerns me a little, quite honestly."" )

When the Eye of Harmony was powering it and the Timelords(specifically the Celestial Intervention Agency) were maintaining it, the Web of Time was very strong, and almost impossible to circumvent.  The Web would snap back from what you were trying to do, or the Timelords would show up and stop you...  Or failing that, they'd simply wipe you completely out of existence so that you were never born.

...However, now the Eye is sealed away with Gallifrey in the Timelock, as are the rest of the Timelords(save for the Doctor, the Master, Omega and possibly the Rani), the Web is growing weaker.  It's starting to twist, stretch thin, and probably even beginning to tear thanks to things like the cracks in the universe.  Time is becoming more and more mutable, it's starting to revert to that wibbly-wobbly ball again instead of an orderly Web.  

Fixed Points, therefore, are not something that **can not** be changed.  They are something that **must not** be changed, or else everything that comes after goes into complete flux, and the universe moves closer to chronological chaos once more.  As the last of the Timelords, it's the Doctor's duty to prevent... or failing that, minimize the damage of that by any means necessary.

Or at least, that's my understanding of it.  There's a little of conjecture of my own in there, and like I said, the canonicity of some of it can be doubted...  But that's probably the most thorough explanation you're going to get anytime soon.

...Oh, and as a sidenote:  Rassilon and the Web of Time are why the basic humanoid physiology is so widespread throughout the universe of spacetime.  Radically different physical creatures with powerful technology, great numbers, extremely alien psychology, and militant tendancies could eventually become a threat to the Gallifreyans...

Who, in the majority of cases, are also drunk.

&gt;the effects on people's mental health are not yet fully known

That's not a justification for a ban. Cannabis has been used by humans for millenia - we would know by now if it routinely caused serious psychological damage. The current research indicates it may raise the incidence of schizophrenia in individuals susceptible to it by approximately three percent, though the jury is still out as to whether or not there's a causative link or it's just self-medication. If the cannabis makes you feel unwell, *you discontinue use and see a doctor*. It's not addictive, and removing legal penalties and thereby much stigma means people will feel more comfortable being able to discuss their drug use with professionals.

It's not harmless (nothing is), but it's safer than aspirin, paracetamol, caffeine, alcohol and tobacco.

&gt;It just strikes me as risky, given we as a nation are prone to destroying our livers on a weekly basis, what would we be like if cannabis is readily available?

Cannabis already *is* readily available. I can get it faster than I can get tobacco, and so can children. There are two million regular cannabis users in the UK. There isn't really a risk here.

We don't punish alcohol abuse with prison time. Why do we do it with other drugs? Being convicted of a drug offence hurts you more than the drug itself!

The benefits with legalisation are many and there are no downsides that outweigh them.

If you're going to downvote me it would be courteous to explain why I'm wrong. Maybe, just maybe, the Daily Mail are not experts on social policy, and all those actual experts who've studied drugs and drug use for most of their lives might actually *be fucking right* when they keep banging on about drug policy being a failure?",0,1314939586,null,0,true,0,c2gxt6f,t3_k1ry9,t1_c2gxt6f,t1_c2gxn5m,1427549129,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

What did I miss? Spell it out please.

&gt; Re: Mathematical probability: I don't get this.

Yeh, you're right. I was a bit too vague. I meant that from what I know, which I admit is very little, the chances of good things appearing in species to help them survive is teeny weeny. Then if you zoom out and see the bigger picture, it's hard to imagine how anything could survive. What I can understand is that if one thing survives, then it's offspring are often given the same survivalist genes to help it to survive too, but with the chances stacked against them all, it terribly unbalances my imagination that there could be so many if this stuff truly happened.

&gt; Yep. Your problem with that being? Evolution is adaptation, its the evolving of a population through genetic not enviromental means and through favoured aspects of random chance.

Well... dunno. The species I had in mind evolved over around 15 years to survive better on an island. It developed it's organs that helped it to survive on the food source of the island. That looks about 0% random to me. 

&gt; Teaching the scientific method is far more important than teaching the facts, as is teaching a way to both logically absorb, interpret and convey information.

Yeh as I said, I have no problem with the method. I'm not saying creationism should be taught to all, but to those that choose it. And children don't have the ability to choose, so that decision should pass to their parents. Creationism has evidence, but I'll admit, there are people that do put 2 + 2 together and get 5. But there are bad scientists too, they just don't get so much of a bad name as bad creationists do. Let's face that fact. Biology was part of creationism long before the theory of evolution was accepted though, so don't separate them &gt;_&gt;

&gt; No its not, and continue down that road and you'll lose this on a Godwins. 

I don't know what a Godwins is, but I know that book burning was ordered because it was seen to be as of the heretic, which means that you think differently (and that's it) and what I see with this petition, is burning the paths to learn creationism (with either it's good or bad science) just because it's seen to be wrong, or different. If the petition was about banning bad creationism, then I'd support that too! Just as I'd support banning bad science. Otherwise, I would keep religious matters to another subject. In a perfect world, I wouldn't think evolution would be taught as fact either.

&gt; I have to accept someone else decides what my children learn.

If you missed the point in my questions, it was that some people don't believe some things, and would feel very bad about their children being forced to learn evolution just as the opposite is true. Creationism is not as ridiculous as you suggest. There's plenty of evidence for it. The highest mountain in the world has stuff from the ocean on it. You may think that this evidence suggests something else other than creationism, but if your eyes were open and you were being reasonable, you'd also admit that the evidence can be seen in favour of the flood of genesis. There seems to be some evidence against creationism, most notably dating imo. While that is true, you also can't say creationism has no ground at all. You cannot. I cannot say evolution has no ground at all either, but I can say why I don't believe it. 

&gt; Beliefs get to a point where they interfere in whats socially and ethically right.

I agree, but let's take that case by case.

&gt; How do you feel trampling the belief of a racist, or a bully?

Self-righteous, and a dispenser of justice. 

&gt; If instead children were being taught that black people were inferior in free schools, would you feel this was ok?

&gt; Accelerated Christian Education was developed in the 1970s by American fundamentalists, but its popularity is now growing in the UK, and not only among home-schooling families - **more than 50 schools in Britain are using it**. 

&gt; Leah, a 13-year-old girl with a ready smile and her hair in pretty clips, moved from a state school to this establishment three years ago. ""I had mixed feelings but now I like it a lot,"" she says. ""Sometimes I miss my old friends but I don't think I'd like it at their school - the peer pressure and everything."" I pick up from her desk a booklet bearing the word ""science"" on its cover and open it at random. ""I'm certain that you will be very interested in learning about God's creation of Earth for human existence. In his loving kindness our Heavenly Father has provided for all your needs from His earthly creation,"" reads the first paragraph I see.

&gt; **Some British state schools have been criticised for putting the creation and evolution as equivalent viewpoints in religious education lessons, but for children at ACE schools the literal interpretation of Genesis permeates everything they are taught**. And for the parents who choose schools like this, such literal use of the Bible is the draw. Tom Price has five children at the school, and loves that they are being taught that the six-day creation story is a fact. ""Evolution removes God from the world. But I see God's hand in everything. I see purpose and design,"" he enthuses. Price is a lay preacher in a Pentecostal church, Assemblies of God. ""I don't want to have to undo and unpick what they are taught at school.""

Zion being Hebrew and Nebuchadnezzar was in history a King who destroyed the Jewish nation... They should've called it the Cyrus, a Persian king who repatriated the Jews to their homeland...

So far every comment here agrees with Mr Cleese. Could someone then articulate what is is they believe is missing? For instance [borez](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/k28oa/john_cleese_londons_no_longer_an_english_city/c2gyvja) comment about foreign cities. What makes Berlin a very German city where London isn't English? What is this missing culture that has disappeared? I always find these conversations difficult because no one articulates what it is they're missing, they just list the things and people they see around specific areas. It'd be easier if you could say ""No one says X any more...no one sells Y any more...no one wears Z any more"" so I can see what it is that's actually amiss. From where I'm sitting it just sounds like there's a general unease at too many non white faces. I'm just wondering what ""culture"" it is I'm living with my black face that flies in the face of British culture. I'm about to head to work, in my western clothes, eat a British breakfast, speak English with my English speaking colleagues, moan about the weather, remonstrate about the state of my sorry Arsenal and come home to watch Eastenders.

What is it about my existence that irks Cleese and his supporters so? Am I to really believe that minorities like myself are indeed a minority?

[satisfiedsardine's](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/k28oa/john_cleese_londons_no_longer_an_english_city/c2gyn06) comment is what I'm talking about. What is it these groups you're talking about do that you're either uncomfortable with or concerned that there's not English equivalent any more? The way they dress? Their religion? Their language...food? If these are your concerns are you saying you're finding it hard to locate white people who speak English wearing jeans and t-shirts who eat chips and go to church? Are they really that rare? Seriously? What's missing?

What I find is middle class Brits have mostly abandoned their own religion, maybe for the better, but it was their own movement, not one from outside, they have adopted a very middle class obsession with the exotic, foreign foods, ethnic clothing, Italian bistros, French cafes, North African restaurants...these are the things you'd find in the swankiest of up market London areas. And once the transformation is made everyone turns around and blames Johnny Foreigner.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"Can we honestly blame Redknapp for Palacios' loss in form, and thus value, since the death of his brother? And it wasn't him that signed Hutton for a stupidly large fee, and given his half-decent form earlier in the season (though please don't mistake me for a Hutton fan) there's an argument that he was worth more than he went to Villa for - we were justed scuppered by comparison to the bargain Liverpool got on Enrique.

Redknapp also wasn't responsible for the stupid money we spent on a player we had no need for in Bentley who has subsequently devalued hugely, nor was he responsible for signing Rocha and Gilberto - the fact they were shit and unable to be sold on doesn't sound much like his fault to me either.

Keane was only bought back from Liverpool because we were desperate for a striker so bought Defoe, only to see him almost immediately ruled out for most of the rest of the season. There were serious concerns about relegation at the time and Keane was the best value option that Levy would sanction in the final few days of the window - though he wasn't a player Redknapp really wanted to bring in he went on to score some important goals in the remainder of that season as we finished strongly to avoid relegation - worth a bit of a loss I'd say. The balance sheet on Keane wouldn't look nearly so bad if Levy hadn't waited until this summer to sell - Redknapp's wanted shot of him for three windows before this, and offers more than double what he went to Galaxy for have been forthcoming, but Levy was holding out to get his 12m back. He eventually gave up, and now we're blaming Redknapp?

The author even inserts a footnote stating we didn't really lose any money on the Bent deal (another non-Redknapp signing who wasn't performing - he was a far worse player then than now) but still uses it to support his point.

Chimbonda, yeah that didn't work out too well, but we lost a maybe a million on, not our life savings.

The biggest problem in the last few years has indeed been to do with sales, but not prices; it's been about nobody leaving because Levy wants to play hardball all the time, and that only really works if the player you're trying to sell is actually good. Keane, Hutton, Jenas, Bentley all could and should have gone before now, saving us a significant chunk in wages, if Levy had be big enough to realise sooner that some of his investments hadn't gone well and the best thing for the club was to acknowledge this, sell at a loss, and learn from it for next time. Instead we've had lots of capital tied up in underperforming players and thus haven't been able to go out and spend on the players we needed to improve. Pav could have gone last summer for 10m, but Levy wouldn't take a 3m loss (again on a player Redknapp didn't sign who had been underperforming).

What a stupid assertion this article is built around. The real reason the club stopped making profits on players in the last few years is that it stopped selling on its best performers and started trying to offload its underachievers instead. And that sounds exactly like what I'd like to see the club keep on doing.

Fin.

edit: I'd just like to add I'm a little tired of defending Redknapp in the face of the criticisms of other Spurs fans these days. I'm not even that big a fan, he's a poor tactician who I don't think is the man to take us forward and I hope this will be his final year at the helm. The rubbish being blamed on him in the last couple of weeks which is patently not his fault however demands some rational response. Much as I respect him for maintaining our position as one of the best run clubs in top tier football the world over, Levy needs to take a lot more of the blame for these things which are currently falling on Redknapp's shoulders.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"Peopel go on about British culture being dissipated. I don't blame immigration. It was rampant consumerism that drove communities apart. The fact that people work longer hours these days, for lower wages, then go home and sit in front of the telly, isolated from their neighbours, afraid to go outside. People don't talk to each other anymore. I think immigration is a convenient scapegoat for a people too afraid to confront their own lifestyle. I think this is the real wedge that's been driven between communities. People are just afraid of the outside world these days. Go home and barricade yourself in your house. Don't trust your neighbours, there's paedophiles everywhere and crime is rampant. Stay at home, surf the web. It's much safer. Good forbid you actually have any face to face time with anyone in your community.

Not to mention, I don't think our culture is dying, and if it is, it is as much to do with Americanisation as it is to do with immigrants. Drinking beer &amp; watching football, celebrating royal weddings, roast dinners in the pub, getting way to excited over the world cup, going mad over the ashes, drinking pimms in the summer, henman hill, strawberries and cream, fish &amp; chips for dinner, casual xenophobia, dry humour, a zest for moaning, rampant queuing, rave culture, antiques road show (love that shit), etc etc. None of these things appear to be on the decline.

Black gangster culture doesn't help at all either.  My dad was hugely racist, but still had black friends.  But the black friends were the ones who ""acted white"".  They had their own house, they went to work, then didn't play loud rap music and annoy the neighbours, they didn't act like gangsters, and so on.  They were upper working/middle class people.  And that was how he saw them.

All of us have an entirely subjective image of  our perceived ""national identity"" that we build up over the course of our lives, as a result of our upbringing and the information we assimilate. This is fine, but if we're going to have intelligent discussions about something like national identity we should start by acknowledging it's an entirely subjective, imaginary entity.

For most, I think - and Cleese is a great example - it involves elements of nostalgia. For many people, racial make up (as they perceive it) gets conflated with national identity. I'm sure that *has* changed in Britain during his life time - although I'm equally sure that for him and others, confirmation bias features heavily in the equation. 

It all boils down to whether one's expectations are in tune with reality. If they're not, it's usually more sensible to recalibrate one's expectations. Particularly on a subject like this, when (a) it's questionable - I would say laughable - to identify ""Britishness"" with a single race; (b) immigration is an unalterable fact of life in the modern world, an essential factor of a free-market economy, and has had innumerable benefits to this country, and (c) Britain's history puts us on *very* shaky ground with regards to punitive policies of restricting immigration.

Absolutely nothing at all. I would also like to add I never mentioned race once, but if we are on the topic of race Poles are predominately white, so you will see my comment was cultural, not racial. 

I made an observation that what invariably happens is that instead of a melting pot occurring of shiny happy people eating each other’s rich ethinc food, in my first hand experience cultures group / band together and fragment into separate communities. I prefer not to live in a fragmented communtiy like that. I like to feel an infinity to a local community and that has nothing at all to do with eating fish chips, playing bowls, being white or any other connotation made to belittle my point. It could even be a community in a different where I am an immigrant assimilating to that local culture as I have done myself before.

Perhaps this is more to do with immigration Policy then anything else as the issue does not seem to exist in the US for example. 

Also in hindsight I think to make the statement about 'London' as Cleese did is far to much of General sweep. So to admit to backtack myself, I dont' entirely agree on his statement on London as a whole.

true,sync0pate,uk,West Mids,"I'm tempted to agree with Mr Cleese on the assertion that London is no longer an English city. I'm not sure I would agree that it is down to immigration though.

As an outsider who was spent a lot of time in London, the city feels almost entirely cut off from the rest of the country. The whole nation's media and politics are hugely London-centric and you get the impression that anything outside of the M25 is thought of as wasteland.

I also agree with you completely about the ""middle class brits"", although I'd extend it to brits as a whole. As a member of the working classes, I am still hard-pressed to think of many of my peers who don't very much appreciate foreign foods and culture in some way or another.

I can quite easily happily put Mr Cleese's comments (if you read the article carefully to extract which comments are actually his) down to the misplaced nostalgia of an elderly man - which has been set upon by the daily express and it's other contributors and twisted and expanded to meet their own racist ends.

People like the Express, UKIP and the BNP are nostalgic for a Britain that never really existed in the first place, and they will latch on to any publicly-expressed sentiment that can be hammered to fit their woolly arguments.

true,RitesOfTheGods,null,null,"&gt;Bollocks. London has historically been a melting pot of cultures from all over the world.

**[The world's melting pot: London has always been a multicultural metropolis](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/the-worlds-melting-pot-london-has-always-been-a-multicultural-metropolis-1436687.html) - ROY PORTER**

*The truth is it isn't new at all. London always was a city of foreigners. For much of its history the percentage of Londoners born outside the capital was actually far higher than today. In a remarkable book, A City Full of People (Methuen), the historian Peter Earle establishes that around 1700, when Samuel Pepys was an old man, Daniel Defoe in his prime and William Hogarth but a boy, a clear majority of Londoners had not been born in the capital. Many had come from overseas: Huguenots from France, Jews from Spain and Eastern Europe, Scandinavians and Germans, Moors and other Mediterranean types. And there are flocks of Welsh, Scots, Irish, and people from the ends of England. Cumbrians and Cornishmen might not seem 'foreigners' to us, but that's how they were perceived at the time, with their different ways and dialects: one sailor around 1700 told a court he spoke 'English and Devon'.*

*A hundred and fifty years later, under Queen Victoria, things were much the same. Between 1841 and 1851, a third of a million streamed into the capital, representing a staggering 17 per cent of London's total population. Similar numbers arrived in the 1850s and 1860s.*

*The majority of these came from a few ethnic groups. Nearly 50,000 arrived from Ireland in the 1840s alone, fleeing the famine. By 1850, London's Jewish population had increased to about 20,000, and in the following fifty years, as refugees deluged in from central Europe, Poland and Russia, it had leapt to 120,000.*

*The city always had pockets of more exotic sorts. By 1800 there were several thousand Black Africans, mostly servants and sailors but also a few musicians, prize-fighters, gigolos and writers. Lascar sailors settled from South East Asia, and from 1800 Limehouse was acquiring its Chinese community; the notorious opium dens came later.*

*This ceaseless flow of migration shouldn't surprise us for a second. After all, Londinium was founded by the Romans, conquered by Saxons and Normans and developed as a commercial centre by Italian, Flemish and Baltic traders. It was always a honeypot for potential Dick Whittingtons (he came from Gloucestershire).*

*If the streets were not paved with gold, the capital always had work, and wages were good. So people poured into what a rather jaundiced 18th-century commentator called 'that great and famous city, which may truly be said, like the Sea and the Gallows, to refuse none'. Without migrants London would never have been famous for silks and watches (made by French craftsmen); it would have lacked ice-cream (made by Italians living in Finsbury) to say nothing of the music of Handel.*",0,1314958808,null,0,false,0,c2gz2kz,t3_k28oa,t1_c2gz2kz,t1_c2gyw8o,1427549787,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

That's a pretty stupid thing to say considering that there's a huge market in the UK for illegal tax free cigarettes. I'd say roughly 2/3rds of the price since that's about what it currently costs to get tobacco illegally. 

&gt;No it doesn't

Yes it does. I had a friend who did the whole 'plant some in the forest' thing and yes it grows but it's still shit weed. You need 5 times the amount and no one would buy it. In the UK we're used to proper hydroponic skunk. Anything less and it's just not going to compete.

In the netherlands they still grow it in huge factories with lights and hydroponics.. That's just how you grow good weed, and it's expensive. 

Currently I can get a 3.5g eighth for £25 of good skunk. £7 odd a gram. That's directly comparable to netherlands pricing where it's legal. 

Then you've got to take into account our governments love of taxing the fuck out of absolutely everything. There's no way it'd be cheaper. No way in hell.

I'm a realist when it comes to these issues. If the government are going to backtrack on such an issue you'll bet your arse they're going to make it worth it.

Actually yes that is right, I should have made that distinction. 

&gt;Also you've complained about downvotes, that's a downvotin'.

I think the use of 'lol' and a smiley face denotes I actually found it humorous/ironic, not a complaint. 


&gt;And then potentially also because your example is obvious and quite poor for the circumstances. A heavy drug user is not the same as a stripper at all, in fact the example is so poor it appears knee-jerk shallow, and would also lead to downvotes.

No a film star in an adult movie is not the same as a stripper, and a drug user is not the same as either. However my analogy of a teacher educating against drug use, while being a drug user is the same as a teacher teaching about safe sex when the very films he stars in promote the opposite. 

&gt;So that's probably why you got downvoted. I hope this clears things up for you, it's not because you stated the obvious, it's because you make mistakes in your analysis.

Actually your patronizing comments are quite funny, and a little bit silly in light of the fact I have just AMA'd in another comment, to *combustible* and stated my view. Knee-jerk  affects those who feel the need to patronize other posters it seems.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"I believe John Cleese has a very good point about a certain lack of Englishness, as long as he isn't just talking about skin colour, back in the glory days of Empire we had something which bound the nation together, all for one and god save the queen...  that *was* England for many people.  The working class people did the Lambeth walk, a talented linguist could place someones dialect to within three streets from just eight words, everyone loved a good old bit of pie and mash, southwark, jellied eels, epping, etc.... PROPER ENGLAND!!!!  Everyone was white and chipper, a gentleman got respect because he was a gentleman and street urchins would sell him a match and call him sir, people worked long hours and accepted their positions with pride, everyone was excited about the new technologies....
  
That was before the disgusting events of more recent years happened; darkies arrive on their bannanaboats desperate to steal our jobs, women started to be taken seriously, you couldn't even beat your own kids anymore...  THE DECAY OF TRADITIONAL BRITISH VALUES!  A pub used to be a pub, where decent people would swap tales and tarns over an ale; not these cheap wine-o bars [that's what i call 'em wine*O*-bars, WINEo-Bars...] and schools were proper because people didn't waste time on joke subjects and got caned for being wrong!...  
   
Heh, needless to say that's an absolutely idiotic view of the capitals history; it's the basic story that's repeated as nausium by the fools that say these things without thinking about them.  That said Cleese is a great man, i suspect he has a much smarter opinion than the main.  
  
A more realistic history is that during the collapse of empire and the modernization of Britain a split opinion developed among the masses  - on the right of course is the establishment and all those pith helmet polishers while the progressive left develops it's standing; pamphleteers and street speakers became common, even trite, in foretelling and demanding a new world.  The capitalist class could no longer simply hoard workers in slums because some bleeding heart Dickens would rally around the cause and highlight it; between Hard Time and Orwells Road to Wigan Pier a whole movement of egalitarian mindedness sprung up, womens rights and aid to the poor became massive things both politically and socially, all the while around us the Empire crumbled; Gandhi and others used our own systems and developing culture 'against us' and to all calamity 'the great war' ended without Britain dominating the world as it had hoped...
  
The wars were a vital time for England, WW1 was a kick in the balls to the old hazzar of horseback chivalry; but much more than that we see a change in the british mind - from it is born the swinging 20's a age of hedonism and change.  After world war two an even deeper change was apparent, initiatives like the 'Land Girls' and WAF had given women the social impetus needed to break through many boundaries and so many years of pulling together for the common good had forged a sense of unity among the masses -ideas like the NHS didn't just make practical and moral sense but they made emotional sense, it was time to forge a new world of fairness and equality, kids would get good educations and all the chances they need to become healthy and useful people...  
  
That's not to say the split in our culture didn't still exist, if anything it was exacerbated - while some saw the collapse of empire others saw it's triumphant rebirth; what was clear was that the world *had* changed and new systems *were* needed.  While one side patted themselves on the back imagining now everyone understood Britain was supreme the other patted themselves on the back imagining now everyone understood Britain was moving forward.  Although of course what with the war and everything everyone had forgotten how they'd come to be where they are; certainly it must have been hard to line up history what with so many things having changed.
  
These two ideologically opposed ideals began their separate course, of course it didn't take long before they'd become entangled once again in endless bickering - politics became very entrenched, not so much the political world which had a complex agreement of tacit toe-avoidance but the home ideologists certainly; look at the culture war between 'squares' and 'hippies' or the battle ground of TV Standards which warriors like Mary Whitehouse devoted their lives to.
  
The labour shortage during the post-war era required the importation of migrant labour, British ships working under charter went and collected thousands of young black male West Indies workers - seeing them infuriated many of the old-minded Empire set but in general the hip young things were cool with it, certainly they'd those that had been brought up on a war regiment were often willing to give anything a go while those brought up in the new school system had been taught about universal human rights and the common accent of man, all ideas created or at least popularised in the modern mind by 'we're all in it together, dig your patch!' style propaganda during the war.  
  
The country so irreparably changed irked many people, having fought for it they believed they had a stake in it and so it was only right it should stay as they like (and dam the rest of them, they're not real english) - of course in their day they walked there in the snow, up hill both ways....  A mythical version of prewar Britain developed, one of green and pleasant lands; somewhat ironically mimicking the same historical fallacy made by blake when he penned those immortal lines complaining at englands downfall back at the very start of our tale...
  
Blake you see is complaining about the vile factories of Southwark which had destroyed the beautiful London vale of traditional faire, although of course he's presumably talking about a pre-industrial London like the one Samuel Peeps lived in when he lorded the 1666 fire of london for being the only thing that could restore London's slums to their former glory....  No doubt it was better when Heimskringla burnt down London Bridge in 1000ad and when the romans were here and before the romans were here....
  
Anyway back to post war Britain and into the culture wars of the sixties and seventies; the atomic age of nuclear families and universal everything was a roller coaster of ideologies and angst - silent lines were drawn in the sand then crossed and redrawn, Freelove, dope smoking, punk, disco and so many 'entertainments' previously off limits to the masses became mainstay, many would argue that the working classes were becoming a universal aristocracy -in that the tradition of eccentric lords and playaway-viscounts had finally reached the lower echelons.  
  
While some were pushing further and further into the new world of post war freedom others were getting bitter and resentful, the mary whitehouse types hated the trash that was on TV and traditionalists bemoaned or beat up any and all with long hair or outlandish threads.  This dichotomy can be seen time and time again as a running war between the two ideological and social views, the **Mod**ernists and Rockers throwing each other off Brighton seafront or the Punks Vs the Man and fuck you that's why.  
  
Two very separate views developed, each news story was spun to the audience / journalists taste - This is why the Daily Mail is off limits to many and why the Guardian, et all were so long derided.  One side had the enemy of old worldism and the crony establishment floyd sung about while the other had lefty liberals and the collapse of social values.  
  
These fairy tales became established in corners of the counties mind and were then repeated so loud and so often that it seems everyone internalised them - most people now hate the establishment *and* the anti-establishment, heh -now *that's* typically british; harks back the the Norman days when we hated the commoner 
english *and* the gentry French with equal zeal - just look at Bernard Shaws St Joan for a comic turn on how this played out.  
  
anyway so in short i'm saying that a false notion of what england used to be has been created as a political tool, now used freely by both sides - mention the work house or Mr Grandgrind and expect looks of consternation and disapproval, that's not the england they're talking about; they mean Mr Darcy and if we must then your lot like Mr Huxley -although of course no mention of the Netherfield Park's servants or how lucky Huxley was to attend such a good (yet frightful) boarding house.  
  
England has been a nation of urban grime for well over a thousand years, people talk about era's of history like the Tudors as it it was a halcyon age where everyone was shakespear rather than his characters; lets forget that his contemporary Christopher Marlowe was stabbed to death in a bar room brawl in a pub Shakespeare used to frequent.  The lack of Britishness isn't anything to do with brown people, it's that Britishness as most wish had existed is a myth.

&gt;Also AMA does not mean what you seem to think it means

I was using AMA as a quick term, and in reference to the other post I made to combustible, rather than a big old lengthy explanation of my previous career.

People were shipped to the workhouse and pits wholesale in a massive labour drive which drove the mills and looms of the late industrial revolution and transformed our nation from a pasture-land into a power-house.  Community developed and and traditional society evolved into close nit working class communities, this was the birth of the working class and the death of the peasant - Unitarian churches and Labour Collectives began to grow, people developed pride and group spirit...

I'm not claiming a secret plot or anything of the sort, simply a constant ideological battle in which the  wealthy and powerful had all the advantages.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"It's the design more than anything. My apartment block is on a newish estate, but has been designed to avoid any communal space at all. Same with a friends block, although that's even worse (the elevators only serve 4 apartments on each floor, and the block has multiple entrances hidden away from each other). So it's quite possible to live in close proximity to large amounts of people, yet have little to no contact with them. I actually spend more time occupying the same shared space as people who take the same trains as me than I do with people who live less than 20m from my apartment. 

The only way to get around this is to change the design, so people keep the privacy they have in their homes, but get forced to mix more in the communal areas around them, or have more space to share. To go to the example of my block again, we do not have any communal grassy areas you could enjoy on a nice day, the nearest park is 1km and several busy roads away, and the houses with gardens have giant fences around them. So the estate where I live is little more than a place where I sleep and store my stuff, I wouldn't even know people well enough to tell them I was moving and beyond a damn cheap rent I have no attachment or sense of community. If I contrast that with the place a friend lives in Germany, they have very low hedges around the gardens, and there seems to be a far higher sense of community, seemly lead by children who treat the whole area as one giant communal garden.

The internet compounds this in my view, as if you live in an area which was designed to be hostile towards communities forming you don't even need to try any more. It's possible to build a social circle from nothing in a new town using the internet to meet people who share your interests in the area, there is no pressure to go out and meet your community. So I still think people have a sense of community, hell even /r/ukpolitics has a community spirit, but the ways we define communities have changed very quickly.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"So what is the exact point of this exercise?

If the school shows discipline levels higher than ever and children behave themselves, do we thank the school or the parenting, or perhaps the nature of the children? Perhaps we can thank social mobility and society for not providing catalysts for 'bad behaviour'.

Let's say we decide the teaching methods and high discipline are to thank. What then? Do we roll it out across the country, ignorant of the potential impact strict discipline has on more free-thinking individuals? That last bit is more posturing, but while classroom discipline is an issue, using ex-servicemen is a bit over the top and not something that could really be applied across the country in all schools.

Let us also mention the CPS.

""The Centre for Policy Studies is one of Britain’s leading think tanks.
 
The CPS develops and promotes policies to limit the role of the state, to encourage enterprise and to enable the institutions of society – such as families and voluntary organizations - to flourish.""

They are essentially a separate body that promotes an alternative to state-led policies, and as such will most likely always be in favour of methods different to the state. This is taken from their website article on the matter:

""To be located in an inner city location in the Greater Manchester area, the first Phoenix Free School will differ from ordinary comprehensive schools in the following ways:

- No moral relativism: high standards of behaviour expected from all students
- Discipline with consent: zero-tolerance with swift and fair responses
- Literacy: a rigorous synthetic phonics programme to eliminate reading and spelling deficits within one year
- Sport and outdoor activities: a competitive sport programme in conjunction with other local sports clubs
- Academic goals: once skills deficits are remedied, courses leading to IGCSEs
- Competition: a competitive house system, and streaming of students in lessons by ability
- Parents and the community: local members of the community encouraged to learn and teach skills in after-school clubs
- Honest achievement: when young people leave school with an inflated sense of self-worth, the consequences are seldom to their advantage

In view of the urgency of the effort against urban gangs, the report concludes that the Phoenix model would be able to make a positive contribution to bringing about a solution, if it were exempted from the sclerotic timetable which are currently compulsory in Free School applications.  This could enable the first school to open in 12 months.""

I don't quite understand how, as Tom Burkard says, that ""teacher training is basically training young people not to teach"". That is just rubbish. I don't think that kind of statement means a thing other than 'we think teacher training is stupid'. I don't think the government should be allowing the mixed use of qualified and unqualified teachers to teach. We have so many people who go to University who want to teach who simply cannot get a place on the courses to become one. These are people who want to train and want to teach, and they are essentially being undercut and replaced with unqualified people.

I don't feel an unqualified teacher would be adequately capable of capturing and encouraging the enthusiasm of a child who might see something they really want to do but the teacher has zero interest, knowledge or enthusiasm for the subject. 

If we're wanting to sort out education, we need to do it properly. Classroom discipline problems and out-of-school discipline issues are the problem, not necessarily the quality of teaching.

I never said that. What I will say, however, is that it is better that a driver is high rather than drunk.

&gt;People may have been using marajuana for millenia, but major developments in mental health research have been fairly recent

We know alcohol actually *does* cause mental illness and that's legal. ""It might be bad"" is not a justification for a ban.

&gt;Also when you say ""current research"", this implies it is still ongoing, and prone to change.

All research is ongoing. That's how science works. Presently, cannabis has not been shown to be harmful to adults, though may increase the risk of developing mental illness amongst child users.

There was one study that claimed it caused brain damage, but it turned out the researchers had actually just asphyxiated the test monkeys, not overdosed them.

&gt;but until we can know exactly the medical risks it strikes me as a gamble not worth taking.

It's not your gamble, though. To quote Bill Hicks, ""I'll smoke, I'll cough, I'll get the tumours, I'll die. Deal?""

I am a responsible adult, or so they tell me. Why, then, am I not allowed to pump myself full of whatever the fuck I want, provided I bother to evaluate the risk beforehand?

That is a good point, and I think it is right and fitting that he should be allowed to teach in the future, if that is what he wants to do. Unfortunately the adverse publicity surrounding it will have had a knock on effect on his employability in the future. I suspect the real reason for his sacking is more to do with the parents not tolerating him as a teacher. 

Problem with what he does is that the kids discovered it for themselves,  yes they should not have been looking at 18 rated films but he must have been aware that it might happen. In that respect, although unintentionally, he was bringing his private life into the classroom.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"This doesn't really suggest the intent is for defiant kids in the classroom though. It suggests more about instilling discipline into children for out-of-school behaviour and will likely be unilaterally applied to children who both need and don't need it. 

The scheme is going to use a mix of qualified and unqualified teachers, apparently, which is what leads me to believe that the teacher training given is going to be rudimentary at best. The focus is on instilling discipline and not actually the teaching, which I think could be handled in a better manner than simply saying 'make ex-servicemen into teachers'.

From my perspective, it seems like a heavy-handed approach based on perceptions of military toughness and a reactionary solution to perceived issues within society with regards to personal discipline. It doesn't seem to consider any negatives of a rigid disciplined education, it's just aimed at 'getting them kids to listen'. 

It completely forgoes any progress we've made at working out why kids may not be interested in education in favour of attempting to hammer them into a peghole in society with more brute force because we aren't willing to look at providing alternative methods of teaching that interests them.

I have recollections that you yourself at some point have advocated changes to the education system that provide alternatives for these children who don't want to be taught in the traditional manner.

Well, from the BBC article:

Year Seven suggests a High School. The provision of IGCSEs, short for International GCSE, apparently is a scheme trademarked by University of Cambridge International Examinations, for 14 - 16 year olds. This International Examinations thing apparently provides international qualifications for students between 14 - 19 years old and looks to be some kind of exam board. 

There's details of the IGCSE on Wikipedia - I've never heard of it until today, so I don't know the full in's and outs, but everything I read about it states it is aimed at 14 - 16 year olds. This age is a crucial moment in terms of education and direction of children/teenagers into shaping their life, and this proposed system wants to shove them through the system instead of pointing them towards alternative directions for what might suit them.

One example: she was not at the wedding of amy and rory; if she was their best mate she would have been. and river knows not to cross her own timeline...so where the hell was mels. I think there is clearly something wrong if mels didn't go to the wedding, as she brought rory and amy together and both of them would expect her to be there. 

Before the big bang, mels didn't exist and amy and rory were still together. i think amy having mels in her life as her best friend after the big bang messed up amy's relationship with rory, as who would think a boy palling around with two girls would be interested in one of them, so in essence mels was forced to bring them together. similarly, in the first episode with amy, no one ever mentioned her pretending to be with the doctor with anyone but rory, who dressed as the doctor.

this is a long shot and probably very off for the alternative universe: but who says river song has to ever exist in the universe before the cracks are sealed. in the first episode of the 5th season the big eyeball is on the other side of the wall and the prisoner escaped through this crack. the other side could be the alternative universe and it was eating at the universe we see in order to remove it from existence due to the future problems that occur, which could be something that destroys both universes. 

the alternate world could very well be that river song never exists in the way we think. In this universe the doctor saves the child and it is returned to amy and rory. I could see the doctor changing everything to force this alternative universe to happen [going to the other side of the cracks and allowing the other world to be completely erased]. When the pandorica flys into the sun the doctor enters the alternative universe, as it is not only to save himself, but to completely erase the other world and prevent all the destruction river song causes after being manipulated by the silence. Who is to say that the doctor that continues to reappear during the pandorica episode isn't from the future...200 years into the future after everything has happened and before he dies. He could have brought river song with him from this universe to the alternative universe some point before the big bang 2, knowing he has to erase the other universe. At the point, she becomes a good friend of his and he doesn't want to lose her. However, she still knows at that point everything that she has done in the alternative universe. On the other side, she willingly goes into storm cage because she knows the problems she caused in the alternative universe; she commits some act of violence that causes them to incarcerate her. Once both worlds are sealed off, amy's memory can be restored as the cracks simply never appeared because the alternative universe didn't exist. It was far too convenient for amy to have simply 'wished the doctor back' and for river to have known to give amy the book to get him back. the doctor could have just come back willingly because he knew amy would remember him when river gave her the book. he didn't want to miss out on being at his companions wedding.

I can't see creativity and freedom of expression being easy to nurture in that kind of environment and I wonder to what extent education in that environment can pros

I would actually argue that in order for creativity and freedom of expression to be worth anything to anybody, it has to come from a response to discipline and structure. Partly because you need to ensure that kids have the basics covered or they won't be able to do anything constructive with freedom, and partly because you need to understand the value of structure and discipline when it comes to managing your own self directed study. If anything, the attempts to focus on freedom of expression and creativity over everything else has resulted in an education system which consistently beats it's own records when it comes to exams, yet has business leaders pleading for kids who are actually capable of working the jobs they have. Life is hard work, and a lot of stuff you have to do is boring, unpleasant or just not what you want to be doing, and kids need to understand this.

&gt; While it is perhaps backed by the Tories, this seems to be more of a voluntary/society drive. Discipline in the classroom has been one of the bigger 'issues' that people have expressed a desire for change regarding, and in some senses I feel it needs to change, but there's just so much more that should be looked at.

As I said, doing it properly is hard work and will not change anything in time for the next election. Doing it properly also means going to war with the teaching profession (some of the changes we need to make won't be popular even if they work well) and various left wing mouthpieces (The Guardian will spin up it's CiF clone army and set them to task no matter what is done with education).

You would also think that he'd make a bigger deal out of it if he were waging an eternal struggle against fate since he frequently approaches saving the planet with a pretty blasé attitude.

Also, he indicates in Waters of Mars that part of the reason he's attempting to change a fixed point is that the Time Lords were now gone and he no longer needed to answer to them - something that wasn't true when he first started saving earth.

And come to think of it, why earth?  I mean, he eventually grew attached to it, but surely he would have seen that it was a fixed point the first time, before he had a chance to get so attached to it to drop everything and keep trying to save it.  He'd have been sad, but there are plenty of instances of him letting bad things happen to people or planets he liked because they were fixed points.

And actually, he doesn't even always drop everything to save it.  Some of the secondary characters make a big deal out of the fact that sometimes he isn't there when the earth is in trouble.  And when he isn't, the Earth still doesn't die.  Torchwood or UNIT or somebody usually steps up.  If humanity's destruction was fixed, you would think they wouldn't be able to do that.

(Plus, as far as I know, it's never been explained/demonstrated whether crossing your own timeline is **impossible** like picking yourself up by your shoelaces until you're no longer touching the ground, or if it's just a really **horrible** idea like burning down your house to eradicate the small coffee stain on the living room carpet[Though a few things from the new series, specifically the start of ""Father's Day"" suggest it's probably the latter])  The Doctor crossed his own timeline briefly too, you'll remember.

And if the entailing alterations hadn't been ""The universe completely falls the hell apart and everything breaks down,"" taking actions that wiped themselves out of existance *possibly* could have triggered a Grandfather Paradox, but on the other hand, if they *completely* made it so that they'd never existed, the Paradox would resolve itself under Whoniverse rules. 
 
That's one of the ways that Timelords dealt with people who were screwing with the Web too much, they'd utterly remove them from time, make it so that they'd simply never existed, it was the most extreme punishment that Gallifreyan culture had(though that may only be in radio-play and novel continuity, I can't remember whether the D-Mat was in the classic series for sure or not).  Either way, the worst thing that can possibly result from violating any of those three rules is...  Well, the universe collapsing in on itself.

Plus I think at some point during the episode the Doctor pointed out that since everything was totally screwed anyway all the normal rules were suspended at the moment(I may be wrong about that though, it's been a while since I watched that episode).

 Edit(because I'm sleepy): Under Whoniverse rules, taking an action that causes you never to have existed doesn't actually cause a Grandfather Paradox(...Even though the Paradox is named after the idea of taking an action to make it so that you never existed, I should probably use a different term here).  Basically, the way it works in the Whoniverse is that, instead of ""You did something that made you not exist- but you didn't exist, so how could have done something that made you not exist- so you did exist and did something that made you not exist - but you didn't exist etc..""  Instead it works more like ""You did something that made you not exist-  except you didn't exist to do something that made you not exist-  Wait, *who* didn't exist?  Oh.. I don't remember...

&gt;In his first incarnation, the Doctor implied that he had built his TARDIS himself. (DW: The Chase) However, many other accounts indirectly implied or directly insisted that he had, in fact, stolen it, although he had intended to give it back. (DW: The War Games, Planet of the Dead, The Big Bang, The Doctor's Wife) One account claimed that he had stolen the TARDIS from the Time Lord Marnal (EDA: The Gallifrey Chronicles) whilst others implied he had stolen it from the general, government-controlled ""stockpile"" of TARDISes, after the model had been officially decommissioned. (DW: The Deadly Assassin, ST: The Exiles)

The programme of study is included for illustrative purposes so that SACREs can develop their locally agreed syllabus to fit with the rest of the curriculum and schools can plan a whole curriculum.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"There's a limited application of it however. To compare an undergraduate, 18 years old upwards, to an illiterate pupil is just ridiculous. Your quote is from the aforementioned Tom Burkard, a former school teacher and military instructor - it's self evident from my perspective that he will be convinced that adaptation of military discipline will work, after all he's seen it first hand. He may possibly be seeing 'civilian' routine as lacking that discipline, but the lack of that discipline does not mean that the inclusion of it is an improvement.

What I feel we would be starting with a rigid discipline system is a 'killing of' of the adventurous elements of freedom and creativity that we develop as we grow - as it is already, the education system today reinforces too often that the answer is always in a textbook somewhere. Too often as a student I've seen people get low marks in essays and the like because they fail to grasp that personal input and understanding/exploration of a given subject is the focus, not the actual material. Creative and critical thinking is hardly encouraged while growing up, and subjects such as History suffer from misrepresentation as a product of that.

Really, my problem isn't really with the service personnel. I'm sure they probably could provide some use in many ways, but their widespread integration into a school isn't always going to be beneficial.

I think we are encouraging the development of something while we have drawn mental parallels to military organisation and discipline and expect orderly children that function as well as anyone else but understand their place in the world and to have respect for discipline and order.

true,Juliano94,uk,United Kingdom,"We know evolution is a fact as much as we know that the Earth is round is a fact (or pick pretty much any other fact you can think of). Either the teaching of both these facts is indoctrination or the teaching of neither is indoctrination. The important thing is that what we teach is the truth, or rather what is most likely to be the truth judging from the evidence (of which there is a huge amount for evolution) and that the children are aware that nothing is ever for certain.

With *everything* there's always a minute possibility that we might be wrong. For example, there may exist a demon that actually tricks all our brains into thinking the Earth is round when it's actually flat. But the probability is so low that we accept that the Earth is round is a fact. Just like with evolution. It is important to teach in schools that we can never be 100% sure we're right about anything, but that shouldn't stop us teaching the knowledge we have. Future generations should just be aware that we cannot be certain about anything and should therefore be motivated to gather more evidence that helps us understand what is most likely to be right or wrong. This goes for everything that's accepted as true: 1 plus 1 makes 2, the earth is round, evolution, the earth orbits the sun etc.

&gt; We should teach stuff that works, because it's useful, but we should also leave space for being wrong, as we often undeniably are.

I totally agree and I would add that knowledge of how our world works is definitely among the useful stuff that needs teaching. And like I've already said, *nothing* (whether it's evolution, the roundness of the Earth or whatever) should ever be taught to the children like this: ""This is fact, don't ask questions."" Scepticism of everything should be encouraged so that the children learn to gather evidence before making a judgement and so that they are prepared to be wrong. They should know that they can build on knowledge built up from previous generations but also should not be afraid to correct the past knowledge if evidence comes to light showing that it's wrong. (If someone in my lifetime did prove that everything we know about evolution by natural selection was wrong - this is obviously hypothetical - I would be absolutely amazed and it would be a great time to live in. I'd be fascinated by the truth, whatever the truth would be. It's certainly something I wouldn't want to miss. I'm almost sad that the likelihood of this happening is so low.)

&gt; How about a petition to have a subject which teaches kids morality? Surely this is far more important a thing to learn? The recent riots are not a recent problem. They are simply a manifestation of old problems that find their roots in twisted virtues, abandoned culture, corrupted communities and other things.

In the UK where I am we have PSHCE (Physical Social Health and Citizenship Education) lessons which are supposed to teach people to be good citizens. In my experience though, they're not very effective. So maybe a petition to have these lessons improved or another compulsory subject created for the sole purpose of teaching morality is a good idea. Whether it's more important than science lessons? I don't know, but there's no reason it should replace science lessons.

&gt; SOTF - Big animal and small animal have a fight, who's going to win? It didn't take so long to figure that out man, seriously. I think I could predict that kind of stuff when I was tiny, mebbe 3-4 years old.

OK I see what you mean now. Yes then, taken on its own 'survival of the fittest' is obvious. But to understand that this is the reason why we have the species that exist today? To understand that this was the process that, over millions of years, caused species to become more and more adapted to their environments? To understand this is why the human body, for example, is like it is? Understanding that species changed so much over time as 'better' features were, on the whole, 'selected' rather than all species just being spontaneously created didn't occur to anyone until the 19th Century. So understanding natural selection and evolution evidently wasn't obvious before it was discovered, however simple it may seem now. And now, on top of that, thanks to our understanding of genes and inheritance, we know exactly how the mechanism happens. I find it incredible, and Darwin deserves the praise he gets.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"A general reply: 

I suppose it comes down to where they are deployed. I really can't see a point of sending ex-DI's to a sleepy middle class village where the only school, CoE, gets excellent grades and the phrase ""spirited hijinks"" covers the entire disciplinary spectrum. But in an inner city school where assault, drugs, vandalism and truancy are all minor problems, one where the primary intake is largely kids who got dealt a shit hand before they were even born and where the few male role models on offer are far from ideal,  in a place like that a few DI's tactfully assigned could do a world of good. As would strict uniform policies, summer schools, weekend detentions, separation of boys and girls and a million other things. The scheme isn't going to work universally (they never do, this is why I'm strongly in favor of decentralization), and it isn't going to work in isolation, but it could well form the part of something that is really quite good.

&gt; What I feel we would be starting with a rigid discipline system is a 'killing of' of the adventurous elements of freedom and creativity that we develop as we grow - as it is already, the education system today reinforces too often that the answer is always in a textbook somewhere. Too often as a student I've seen people get low marks in essays and the like because they fail to grasp that personal input and understanding/exploration of a given subject is the focus, not the actual material. Creative and critical thinking is hardly encouraged while growing up, and subjects such as History suffer from misrepresentation as a product of that.

This I feel needs to be addressed separately. I would again argue that if you want to encourage more adventurous thinking, personal freedom and creativity, then you need to start from structure and discipline. You need to equip children with the tools they need in order to develop on their own, literacy, numeracy, the basics of logical thinking and philosophy, and how to present information and ideas to others. If they don't have these tools, then what use is more self directed learning going to be? This is a problem we have in the education system today, as you can quite easily fail early on, and then face being pushed forward each year to newer and harder material despite never have grasped the foundations. There is no summer school if you fail to make the grade at the end of the year, and there is no retaking a year if summer school can't help. So by the time you get to GCSE's, you have people who were left behind years ago and have most likely dealt with the boredom they felt as lessons become more self directed and open-ended by acting out or becoming a bully. 

So I think that we are trying to treat children in the same way that we would like to be treated as adults, and this is a problem because children are children, and it takes effort to turn one into an adult. The more open ended, self directed learning you favor is very important, but I think you are trying to introduce it earlier than it should be. That is the type of education that is more suitable for older children in their teens, something to introduce in a tapered fashion towards the almost entirely self directed stuff at university level.

There are other things we need to do, research has shown that bad parenting in the first 2-4 years of a child's life can cause permanent behavioral problems you just can't fix, so that is an area that needs a lot more attention. And you also need to devise a way of filtering the non-academic kids into more suitable education while this is going on, along with streaming based on ability for all subjects from an early age.

Take for example every Silence related picture or link we have on this Reddit. In the comments you will always have ""Hmm I seem to have forgotten something"". This is usually the top rated comment. Really it was funny for many a few days after series 6 started, but not it is just overdone and users do it because they know it will get them some Karma. 

Take for example this [recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/k25wn/finished_my_silence_stencil_art/). This user did a great stencil, but the top rated comments are all ""I seem to have forgotten something"" comments. When a much better comment asking about how he did the stencil and complementing him on his work has less points. 

There might be threads where getting rid of the downvote arrow might make sense such as new show discussion so people can feel like they can say that they didn't like the episode without fear of getting tons of negative karma.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; are you actually going to argue that cannabis use does not impair driving? Really?

It's not that simple. According to all the studies I've seen, while it slows reaction time the drivers adapt and are more cautious and are actually more safe in some conditions. This is the opposite to drinking, where people take more risks and often pay the price for it. 

In almost all cases where a driver has been in an accident while stoned, they were also vastly over the drink-drive limit. I believe the figure is around the 80% mark. This is deliberately omitted when the subject is discussed but it's very important IMHO. 

&gt; major developments in mental health research have been fairly recent.

These studies have been largely debunked, there has been zero causality proven between smoking and developing mental health issues.

McGann, Tennant and Smith would be interesting. McGann is before he ends the Time War. It would be interesting to see how 10 and 11 react to 8, knowing what happens to him. Time to have fun spit-balling ideas.      
     
Perhaps this hypothetical 50th anniversary special could even have something directly to do with the Time War. Things get timey wimey for one reason or another and 10 &amp; 11 end up meeting 8 directly before the end of the Time War.     
Things get wibbly wobbly and through their connection to the pre-timewar doctor, 10 &amp; 11 are able to join him in the last moments of the war. We'd finally get to actually see the last moments of the Time War for the anniversary.     
     
After whatever final battle writers think up, the movie could end with 8 laying hurt and beginning to glow with regeneration energy. Since Chris E won't come back, the writers could come up with a reason for 10 &amp; 11 to leave before they see the results of the regeneration. Perhaps staying will get them locked in the impending time-lock. 10&amp;11&amp;Audience could leave right as the main burst of yellow energy starts.

I wouldn't say the provision of such services necessarily says anything one way or the other about the merit of their religion - either as regards the truth and worthiness of the overall religion itself or even necessarily as an educational charity - for the latter, it'd depend on both motivation and the quality of provision; for the former it'd be almost entirely unrelated to their building schools (though if they did it well and for honest/laudable reasons, I'd view it as one score for their worthiness).

I think hardcore, heavyweight, strongly evangelical proselyting at an early age can be tantamount to child abuse and should absolutely be discouraged; on the other hand, I think freedom of religion is an established part of our national values and shouldn't be questioned so long as it is compatible with the rights of children not to have the choices life otherwise makes available to them closed down before their ability to make rational or at least mature ones kicks in.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I don't really feel like the government is concerned with philosophical truth, but rather with civic good. 

Indeed, I was just answering the question proffered (though, of course, there were several in government when the policies were passed, as there are now, with a particular religious axe to grind).

&gt;It's probably worth noting also that at almost all religious schools a pupil is not required to believe in any deity or subscribe formally to the religion. 

This is not strictly relevant, but point noted.  Assuming it is practically, rather than merely notionally true, the consequences could flow several ways.  Certainly, given that I presently live in another currently heavily targeted/evangelised, moderately atheistic nation, where quality education (especially for expats) can be very expensive, I had to seriously consider the option of placing my children in a steeply discounted, but religiously wholly incompatible school.  I eventually decided against it, and sadly their education (and my wallet) will suffer as a consequence, but at least I won't have to spend large amounts of time deprogramming them to enable them to think clearly about the world.

&gt;Attending a mass every half-term at my school was compulsory, but in religious education class open debate was welcomed.

Frankly, that's little more than my C of E Primary required, and it's not really those sort of levels of indoctrination with which I'm concerned.

&gt;I think some people often act on the assumption that a belief in god is factually wrong and therefore functionally wrong. Not everyone is a rationalist atheist, and laws are established democratically rather than technocratically.

Fair points, but I'm not arguing the case for religion or atheism so much as the right of young children at least to be able to choose their own path in life rather than to have a single intellectually-crippling world-view laid out for them.  I'm not suggesting all or even much religious education is intellectually-crippling, but you and I both know that some is because it officially and dogmatically precludes the acquiring later of other forms of knowledge, and hopelessly distorts the perception of other forms of knowledge.  I'm a moderate, I'd be equally against a dogmatically atheist upbringing which so aggressively drilled on logic and ridiculed faith that it bred a kind of spiritual autism.  There's a place for each and people should be raised balanced enough to come to a reasonable compromise between them.",0,1314999505,null,0,true,0,c2h3l4x,t3_k2mjf,t1_c2h3l4x,t1_c2h3eca,1427551923,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

(Othe European white being mostly Irish, and some Polish. 

When I was younger, there was trouble between white youths and Bangladeshi youths, as I have got older I seen things change between my eyes. The reason why there is no racial tension between white/black (I will address this later on in my post) and Asain is the fact that pretty much all street Drug Dealing has been picked up by young Asian (Bangladeshi) youths. Provided with raw materials by Turkish/Greeks of Haringey.

Because the West Indian black people were the first to come over to London and offered jobs post WW2, they were obviously the first to integrate. But as they come from an old colony of ours, they integrated a lot easier than the Bangladeshi. 

If you look at society, today, racism aimed towards South Asians. Look at the football league, from the Premiership to non-league football, where are the asian lads? But to be balanced, the IT industry in this country has more South Asians than anyother Race.

She's a damn good shot, proven later in the same story, but she apparently misses every shot that she fires at the Astronaut. Most curiously, though, she says ""Of course..."" as if remembering something, just as she runs out of bullets.

Regardless of that, she's the one who first holds Amy back when the Doctor is getting shot. She knows more than she's letting on - that's a given - but in this case, she's a little more obvious about it, it's just that the others were too distracted to notice.

So your ""Flaw"" actually makes perfect sense. She seems resigned to what appears to be an established event in her history.

===========================================================================

That said, I'd be very surprised if Eleven is the last Doctor. 

For one thing, if they plan to televise 200 years' worth of adventures (although I suspect the Doctor may recalculate his age at some point soon), Matt Smith will age visibly in the time it will take to do that. Similarly, the other actors in those scenes will too, not to mention contractual issues and mortality. So if they intend to revisit the picnic, they more than likely intend to do it soon. 

The footage was probably shot at the same time as the TIA shoot, so it's in the bag, more than likely for the season finale.

Yeah, in retrospect I was vague.  In the scenario I'm pondering, she thinks that David Tennant's Doctor is the Twelfth, because she hopes he is a later regeneration of the Doctor she knows;  she then discovers that he is an *earlier* regeneration instead.

I agree with you that letting Matt Smith be the last Doctor would be an incredibly ballsy move, and deliberately ending the franchise here doesn't make a lot of sense.  Wouldn't it be amazing if they actually let the story end there, though?  Everybody expects a last-minute fake-out, when we've been told time and time again that this is where the Doctor dies.  I'd rather see a tragic, bittersweet finale then a lame cop-out ""fooled you!"" moment...although I have to say that the setup in LKH was a perfect example of foreshadowing and winning within the established rules, so maybe they'll pull it off.

I'm not against teaching what people genuinely think is right, but there should be the humility not to trample on other's values. That attitude to seek what is right is what brings so many to God. 

&gt; In the UK where I am we have PSHCE (Physical Social Health and Citizenship Education) lessons which are supposed to teach people to be good citizens.

I didn't know about this :o Haven't been in the country for a couple of years though. I can't imagine much effort has been put into those though. Yeh, I wouldn't suggest it replaces science lessons. But if it's more important? Well, most things we learn in academics are just tools, including science, they occasionally help to add context and meaning but largely not. So where are kids supposed to learn this? Do we look at the problems and think, we want our children to fight these? and make the world a better place? Surely there is space in the lab to do this stuff, but what the world needs the most, by far the most, is love. I'm not trying to say that love is a lone subject that should be taught, it kinda encompasses lots of things right, but people need direction in their lives, and right now, they're not getting it from school or their parents most of the time.

Yeh, people didn't understand the details of natural selection, but they knew the process before it was given a name. 

&gt; I have quite enjoyed this discussion; nice and relaxed which is rare for internet discussions, so thanks for that :)

Is this your way of saying you want it to end now? ._.
Man back to a previous point, I mentioned that history isn't taught accurately. While some of it surely is, there are many things left out or changed. We see this happen in other countries like China, and we disapprove but it happens in UK too. Then there's the history pushing a bit further back, for example, the history of the bible. That is a very interesting history, for anyone I might add. Pushing further back, there's all the unanswered questions, like the pyramids, lebanon stones, those fortresses built too high in altitudes that people cannot survive in, prehistoric nuclear fission, and tons of other stuff. Alllll this stuff that gets blatantly ignored makes me even more inclined to doubt popular history as is taught in History and Sciences.

true,Juliano94,uk,United Kingdom,"No, I said ""I'm very glad that I was taught the truth and not what my parents **might** have wanted me to spend my life believing"". It's hypothetical. I'm glad that I was taught ideas and theories that are based on evidence rather than purely what my parents might (in this hypothetical situation) have wanted me to believe is true. I'm glad that my parents never forced me to believe anything.

However, I see what you mean with the analogy of being brought up as a Jew. The difference is (and I didn't make this clear in the first place, I apologise), that I was always allowed to make my own mind up, rather than being told to believe something and being told that if I believe anything else it is bad. It is this I am grateful for. I'm glad that my parents didn't influence what I would learn (and who knows, if they had, I may have ended up a loose Christian like my father) and so I was able to find out things for myself.

If I had been brought up as Jew, you might be quite right that I may have then said that I'm grateful for being brought up a Jew. But that wouldn't change the fact that I'd have been taught ideas about the universe that have no evidence for them. And if one day my alternative Jewish self figured out that my beliefs are completely baseless, I think I'd be angry at my parents for indoctrinating me. But real life me was not indoctrinated. I was brought up to be curious and find out things for myself. School gave me what was already known by other people, enabling me to 'stand on the shoulders of giants' as they say. But if ever I find evidence suggesting that anything I learnt back then is wrong, then I am completely comfortable in correcting it. This I am grateful for.

Ugh that was poorly explained. But it's 2am so I think I can be forgiven.

Basically I don't think that anyone, including parents, should have the right to teach children that things are true if there is no reason to believe it's true (even if there is reason to believe it's true the child should always be made aware of the possibility that it's wrong). It's up to the child to find out for his/herself later in life what is or isn't true.

Fixed points in time are not unchangeable, but they're the starting point of a bigger event that shapes the universe.


Time is not fixed on a proper sense of the word. He even said it himself on that last speech... He says something along the lines of ""Screw the timelords, i'm the last one, I make up the rules now, I'm timelord victorious!"" At that moment we see the new articule change to something like ""captain adelaide is a coward for escaping"". It means he changed the timeline.. By altering it, her granddaughter would have never followed adelaide's footsteps.


Adelaide realizes the importance of her dead, and to spite the doctor's best efforts, she commits suicide. Her dead brings the timeline back closer though not completely to what should have been originally (everyone dies AT the mars base).  That gunshot is what really puts things into perspective for the doctor (and we see the article change again back to something similar though not the same)... 


Timelord Victorious comes with consequences. He now has blood in his hands because he directly caused the suicide of a good person where her dead should have been left at the waters of mars.

true,Juliano94,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Indoctrination becomes an issue when other choices are banned

So are you saying that a school should have the choice to teach the children there that the Earth is flat? Because if this was banned it would be indoctrination? Schools should teach the best of human knowledge to children, which means that what should be taught should be what there is most reason to believe is right. It does not do to allow schools to teach that the Earth is flat or creationism to children, because this is, at best, incorrect human 'knowledge'. As long as the children are aware that they can make their own minds up and that there is that minute possibility that what is being taught is wrong, then it's not indoctrination. It is the passing on of knowledge. Likewise (to show that I am not just biased), if creationism were taught in this way, making sure children are aware it might be wrong, it would not be indoctrination either. It would, however, be passing 'knowledge' that is almost certainly incorrect, which is why I would oppose it. Humans are intelligent enough to be able to tell, using evidence, how likely something is to be true and this should be the prime influence in deciding what to teach our children.

Yeah, I don't think much effort has been put into PSHCE lessons unfortunately. The citizenship part is relatively small within it as well. Children also don't take it seriously.

Personally I'd argue that knowledge of science (particularly evolution!) is essential to understanding morality. Well, maybe not the basics of being a good citizen such as is (supposed) to be taught in PSHCE, but if you want to understand morality I think you have to understand the human brain and the environment in which we live. For example, we have to understand how our actions affect the Earth and the other inhabitants of the Earth.

I don't think people understood natural selection as the process which causes life to change over time until Darwin. I'm sure they only understood it as far as, like you say, 'big animal beats small animal' kind of thing. Part of the reason why there was so much fury at Darwin is because his idea went so against what was accepted to be true about the world.

No, that was not my way of saying I want to end it. Just being polite.

One of the brilliant things about history lessons in schools is that there's so much emphasis put on using evidence to find out what happened and being aware that sources can be misleading. It's not at all about just making things up. Children are taught the importance of learning from evidence. Obviously we cannot know exactly everything about the past and children are taught this. They are taught that we can only use evidence to get the best general picture and maybe learn some details. In this way, I actually think history education has been a great success.

Unfortunately if you want all questions answered you'll find yourself continually disappointed. There will almost certainly always be unanswered questions; we are unlikely ever to know everything. I'm content with finding out as much as possible. ",0,1315013939,null,0,false,0,c2h53nd,t3_k16k7,t1_c2h53nd,t1_c2h4tgu,1427552628,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's fixed because if it doesn't happen, events effecting the entire universe after it would change drastically. It can't not happen. 

The exact order of events may have been changed slightly, but the important parts of the fixed point are maintained. 

For example, with Pompeii it's not important *why* the volcano blows up - aliens responsible or natural disaster - it's just important that it does and it destroys the city. 

The entire *point* of showing the Doctor trying to change the fixed point was that he *can't* and he was commiting hubris by trying. Something will happen to change it back, because too much of the future is dependent on that event happening. He may have saved Adelaide from death on Mars, but his actions were directly responsible for her killing herself and the restoration of the timeline.

If it wasn't, they wouldn't call it a *fixed* point. 

The Doctor himself has made a point of saying you can't fuck with historically important events in time, and the entire point of Waters of Mars was to show that the Doctor was getting a little too full of himself and to knock him down a peg.  How else can you show that better than him trying to change a major historical event and having him result in being the *cause* of the death of the person he thought he could save?

It seems people don't want it for the sake of keeping the show completely British. Although, don't get me wrong, I'm not sure I'd ever be ready for an American Doctor, but for a couple reasons.

1)a little superficial, but I'd rather an American Doctor not fake a British accent for the sake of seeming British(which is a good possibility it would happen).  With that said, I'd think it'd be weird for everyone to have British accents except for The Doctor. Although I do admit this could add an extra/interesting element to him feeling like an 'outsider' among humans.

2)As an American, I kind of enjoy watching Doctor Who to see Doctor's quirky British behavior. I get enough of quirky American behavior here.

With that said, I would still give an American Doctor a chance. I would give him just as much opportunity to grab me as I did with any other Doctor. Hell, I don't think anyone would agree with me, but I'd even give a separate American production of Who a chance(keyword on separate, as in having nothing to do with BBC Who).

Regardless, I figure there's got to be some mechanism in the Tardis, or in his screwdriver that records his subjective timestream. Who knows, we could get a ""bumbling Doctor"" moment where he finds that mechanism and says ""Oh dash!

And frankly, I think a lot of the British fans would just have a shitfit if an American was cast as the Doctor (I can just imagine the screams about the show getting Americanized if that happened). There's just something distinctly British about the Doctor. 


I mean, of all the dozens of companions the Doctor's had, very, very few of them have not had some sort of British accent.

true,chochazel,null,null,"&gt; The immigration policy over the last 5 years will have changed it to 50/50 for 2011 I would imagine.

Ignoring for the moment the fact that you think it's worthwhile trying to *imagine* statistics, when the whole point of statistics is to find truth behind people's perceptions, misconceptions, anecdotal evidence and prejudices, I think that's highly unlikely for the following reasons:

1) in the preceding *6 years* From 2001 to 2007 the drop from White British was around 2% from 59.8% to 57.7%

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London

2) there has been no increase in immigration in recent years.

Yes you will see articles like [this one](http://www.globalvisas.com/news/uk_immigration_figures_reveal_20_per_cent_jump3302.html) which talk of a 21% rise in net immigration from 2009 to 2010, which appear to show immigration has gone up in recent years, but a [closer look](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/august-2011/msqr.html) at the figures reveals two things.

1) immigration has remained at a steady level in recent years

2) the reason for the increase in net migration is a reduction in *emigration* 

So if fewer White British people are moving out, that is actually going to act as a dampener to changes to the demographics in London.  There is therefore no rational reason to imagine there has been an unprecedentedly large 7.7% drop in the last 4 years.

true,satisfiedsardine,null,null,"I personally have a beef with the faith school setup.

One of the schools in our catchment area which our daughter had a high chance of going to used to be a run of the mill primary called Lea Junior.

It was then knocked down and became the [Iqra Islamic Primary School](http://www.iqra.slough.sch.uk/). It claims to be a multi faith school, but the school uniform has a badge with the text '""In the name of Allah(SWT), the most Gracious and the most Merciful"", Koran quotes are on most of the walls and local imans from the mosque come in to do talks on Morals. This must be great if you are a Muslim with children in the area, but its not education format we wanted for our daughter.

Since its opening about 4-5 years ago its started to fail and the local council are considering replacing the governors - the following quote from chair of the governing board Zafar Ali says a lot on the internal view of the schools standing ['It is unacceptable that both the chair of IQRA and the head teacher of IQRA School would be non-Muslims. That will not protect the Islamic ethos of the school.](http://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/news/article-19499-governors-face-axe-from-failing-muslim-school/)

In the end we moved area so the its no longer an issue for me, but it still Irks me that my money as a tax payer funds such schools.

I have no issue with a school being multi faith and having a religious ciriculum - I think for my daughter to be taught about sikhs, buddhists, jains, brahim, islam and in turn learn tolerance of others beliefs is a great thing. 

I also don't have issue with a private school teaching whatever they like within reason.

No, he won't, but simply put, He's a Doctor that keeps the storys light and happy and cheery when it needs to, funny when it needs to, but when he needs to get serious, you bet your ass that he can be downright mean (Something he shares well with Tennant). Even though I'm going to give a SERIOUS strong argument about Eccleston, that he really wasnt around long enough to hit his fully potential, his Doctor came off as downright mean and moody most the time, which is a fantastic take on the character, but Smith and Tennant do it while still being happy.

He's one of the best people to ever play the Doctor, because of his approach and commitment to the job, especially with a VERY hard script that would have gave Tennant a run for his money, and he's a Shakespherian actor.

Of course, we didn't accept this qualification.  He went absolutely crazy and was yelling all sorts of insults.

Also, Q's status related to the Q Continuum is a bit like the Doctor's status related to the Timelords. Q himself is a bit like a timelord, if you think about it.

More of the Fifth with Nyssa, more of Fifth and Sixth with Peri, more of Sixth and Seventh with Mel, and more of Seventh with Ace for instance(not to mention even a few appearances by the Brigadier), as well as the introduction of companions and other recurring characters wholly new to the radio-plays(Personally not a huge fan of Erimem or Brewster, but Hex is awesome and if you don't love Evelyn you have no heart).  

I got hold of the NVA books myself, but I've only read a little here and there so far, wish I had a TARDIS of my own to pop outside the timestream for a few weeks and sit down to some serious reading of them.

&gt;Poorly produced moonshine can be contaminated, mainly from materials used in construction of the still. Stills employing used automotive radiators as a condenser are particularly dangerous; in some cases, glycol products from antifreeze used in the radiator can appear as well. Radiators used as condensers also may contain lead at the connections to the plumbing. Both glycol and lead are poisonous and potentially deadly....

&gt;Any alcohol that is at least 80 US proof (i.e., 40% alcohol by volume) is flammable. This is especially true during the distilling process in which vaporized alcohol can accumulate in the air if there is not enough ventilation.

The flash points of alcohol concentrations from 10% ABV to 96% ABV:

* 10% — 120 °F (49 °C) — wine
* 20% — 97 °F (36 °C) — fortified wine
* 30% — 84 °F (29 °C)
* 40% — 79 °F (26 °C) — typical whisky, brandy
* 50% — 75 °F (24 °C) — strong whisky
* 60% — 72 °F (22 °C)
* 70% — 70 °F (21 °C) — absinthe
* 80% — 68 °F (20 °C)
* 90% — 63 °F (17 °C) — neutral grain spirit
* 96% — 63 °F (17 °C)

Most countries in the world require distillers to have a license for those reasons primarily.  There is no war on alcohol in places like Germany and Finland.  Besides, even in America, most states permit home brewing, just not distillation.

Mostly urban mythology (fostered by tax-raising powers)...  Fires, possibly if you're careless, not explosions though.

http://www.home-distilling.com/HD_health.asp

Edit:  I note that your discussion of 'poisoning' is actually not about the distilling process, but simple ""hygiene"".  In which case, I've really no argument on what you say, just suffice it to say that you could equally poison someone with beer or wine made in a similarly dumb fashion - lead stoppers for your wine bottles or a lead lining in your beer kettle.  If this were a legal hobby like any other, just as with homebrewing of beer or wine, stockists would sell the appropriate equipment and sanitising supplies.  It's only because people are acting illegally using inadequately researched information and supplies from hookie suppliers or bodged together in a garage that these problems arise...

Edit edit:  Wow, I'm surprised a fairly educated sub-population still (!) subscribes to these myths.  I guess it shows how powerful government propaganda can be.  There's absolutely zero science to it though, ask any decent chemist.

My contention would be that the Irish travellers (I'm not going to talk about the Roma as I have little knowledge of them) are Caucasian/Celtic as they are descendants of the dispossed Irish from Cromwellian times. So how can they claim **racial** discrimination as they are as you quoted an ethnic group.

True, they are discriminated against and this is inherently wrong. BUT I did say that they should obey the laws of the countries they settle in.

If they break the laws, they themselves are discriminating for themselves in their own favour. The laws are there for everyone, you can't just cherry-pick those you feel you want to abide by.

Either that or I'd go with the tradition(that has exceptions of course) of using an unknown or little-known character actor after a long series of auditions so that they weren't bringing any baggage into the role.   As far as the format, I like what Moffat's doing with it now, two and three-parters and arcs that are woven throughout the series.  

For some other stuff I'd do...  I'd probably want to bring the Ice Warriors and the Sea Devils for a start...  I'd also do whatever it took to resolve the copyright issues that are making it impossible to bring back the Rani.  I'd leave the Master dead a while longer so it'll be less expected when he *does* come back...  But you had **better** believe that Omega would be coming back into play.

The rest of the Timelords beyond those three though, I would absolutely *not* bring back under any circumstances, it would feel wrong and disrespectful of all the work RTD did, and all the great pathos built up with the last three Doctors about being the last of his civilization.  If anything, I'd find it more interesting to experiment with a new paradigm being built up with the Doctor, Jenny and River at the head to try to keep *something* like the Web of Time intact with a whole arc of a season or two where it's starting to really come undone and things are going horribly wrong, only for it to reveal at the end that it's the Daleks(who were never supposed to be part of things and are, in fact, a creation of the Doctor himself's actions) behind it all.  Really *use* them as a great villain instead of just dropping them down somewhere unexpected, shouting **EXTERMINATE** a few dozen times and having the Doctor pull something out and send them off running again.  

I'd also concentrate less on flashy special effects and expensive settings and put the budget more toward hiring on great writers and good bit players, Doctor Who's at it's best when it's a story about characters involved in complex moral problems where nobody's really in the right and everybody's afraid, rather than just having legions of neat-looking and expensive aliens chasing everyone around.

Oh, and since the Timelords are gone now..  I'd find a way to spend another whole series bringing back a Great Vampire or two.  That was one thing about series 5 that *really* bothered me, when the Doctor seemed *excited* about vampires in Venice.  The Great Vampires were the worst foe the Timelords ever faced up until the Daleks themselves, he should **not** react that way to even the whiff of a bloodsucker.",0,1315057983,null,0,false,0,c2h7waq,t3_k3hu3,t1_c2h7waq,t3_k3hu3,1427554014,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The first and most obvious is that Amy is Legs and River is Mrs. Robinson. This is funny because its based purely on looks, as its the Doctor that's actually much older. River picks up on this : ""Oh I hate you...""

The second level is a bit more of a stretch. Amy tried to make out with her future son in law back in Series 5. Maybe she was Mrs. Robinson and River was Legs.  Don't think too much about this one, its just for laughs. 

When the Doctor says ""Who's Benjamin?"" There is not deep implication that he hasn't seen the Graduate and he's somehow a younger Doctor. That's way too much of a stretch and contradicted by all kinds of things he knows in the episode. I think it demonstrates that his mind is very quick and working another level beyond what the others in the room are picking up on.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Now first of all I'm really enjoying this conversation as this is what I believe Reddit should be, and you sure as hell know your stuff. I'm mainly going on personal opinion here.

Travellers are discriminated against but they also discriminate against settled people. Travellers will very rarely welcome non-travellers into their tight-knit family communities. Can a settled person marry into a traveller family? I'm sure it has happened but extremely rarely.

I know some settled travellers here in Paris (believe it or not) and I have the utmost respect for their business acumen. One guy left school at 15 and now runs an international moving company for the mega-rich. Fair play to him.

The point I am trying to make is that the travellers on Dale farm abused/ignored the planning laws for their legally owned land. Owning land does not entitle you to do what you want to do with it. It depends on the local authority zoning for that land. The Dale Farm travellers have not followed the zoning restrictions.

The other point I am trying to make is that Irish travellers are not a racial group. For example are Bretons a race or an ethnic group? Are Basques a race or an ethnic group? Are Catalans a race or an ethnic group? I think the answer to those three questions are clearly No.

I still contend that the Irish travellers are not a race so racial discrimination should not be quoted. Xenophobia yes, but not racism.

And jumping to the 1980s - it was seen as an issue then that primary education was overwhelmingly a female profession

At this time the argument was that pupils should see men working with young children to help eradicate the impression that teaching was ‘women’s work’/‘child care’ and simultaneously reduce the low status and 
poor promotion prospects accorded to teachers of this age group.""*

That's not to say there aren't serious logical issues with the River/The Doctor storyline:

- She saw his youngest self at the very end of her life, but she had to check her book to find out where she was in her timeline. That was the only time she met 10, so she should know that this was her first meeting with him. Checking her book was silly.

- If their lives really _are_ ""back to front"", then The Doctor missed out on quite a lot of their interpersonal history since he has now met her for the first time, and she, him for the first time.

true,navahgar,null,null,"The most important point is that I think Meireles was coming back from injury.  I don't think he's been just kept out of the midfield on form.  KK was easing him back, but players who filled in when he was out performed well, so KK took a longer time to fit him back in.

Assuming he's fit though, where does Meireles fit?  Our central midfield normally has three positions: Defensive Midfielder (DM), Deep-Lying Playmaker (PL), Attacking Midfielder (AM).  Right now, Lucas has locked up the DM role.  Meireles could play either as the PL or the AM.  Adam has fitted into the PL role very well so far.  With Adam's performances at PL, Meireles would find it difficult to start there, so AM is the potentially available role.  When Gerrard is fit that position has to be his to lose.  Until then, however, I think Meireles should have been used in the AM role.

KK apparently has been preferring Henderson in the AM position so far.  I think that's because of his versatility.  If we play with Suarez and Carroll up front, then either the AM gets sacrificed, or the right winger gets sacrificed, and the AM needs to push further wide.  Henderson can do that very well.  In fact, he started from the right in the first game.  When Gerrard comes back, I think Kuyt will be preferred on the right wing, and Henderson will drop to the bench, but it's possible he does enough between now and then to take Kuyt's job.  Also, we now have Bellamy to fill that right side role.

Ultimately our tactics are dictated by whether we play one striker (Carroll or Suarez), or two strikers (Carroll and Suarez).  In the former, the DM, PL, and AM play in central midfield, with the AM fluidly switching with the wingers to support the striker.  In the latter, the DM stays, the PL needs to be more attacking (something Meireles would have been good for), and the AM is either sacrificed, or moves further wide.

I guess this is a long way of saying, I think Meireles was allowed to leave because we have other people who are more specialist in the specific roles we play in the deeper midfield roles, and who are more flexible for the roles we use in the more attacking midfield roles.  I suppose the genius/idiocy of the move depends a lot on how well Gerrard comes back and/or how much Henderson improves.

I always have a problem understanding British Accents sometimes, at least in fights with wooden dolls and comically large pink safety scissors, but this felt a little rushed. He just leaves his parents to raise an alien child? Okay....

I really get the fear of Doctor's but considering everything we know now it seems like they dropped the ball. Desire for a child, Doctor being something to fear. Reading the posts I wish this had aired before Demon's Run, it would have been foreshadowing rather than making the characters look emotionally dull...

Or was I just emotionally numb today? I can't tell.

The only element that actually unsettled me was the wooden doll transformation, which we only saw twice and so late in the episode that there was no time to properly build it up before resolving it.  Not to mention Moffat did almost exactly the same horrific transformation bit, only much better, in The Empty Child.

Ever since RTD brought back Who in an hour format I've felt that the show has had problems fitting into the hour (or 42 minutes or whatever) format, especially for the stand alone episodes. This episode is really a prime example of the problems Who has fitting into an hour. This really feels like it could have used at least another 20 minutes to give a better resolution to the story

true,troffle,null,null,"&gt; River wasn't raised in the Gamma Forests, but she was given that name by a native whose language didn't have words for ""melody"" or ""pond"". We were shown this

Except ""Hitler"" showed us she got her name from the Doctor himself.

&gt; There are many entities in the universe who have knowledge of the Time Lords

Except none of them own the TARDIS; there's supposedly only one TARDIS and one Time Lord left (so the Justice Department next-of-kin laws sort that); not only was the Doctor legally forgiven and given the TARDIS in his second regeneration. Which means nobody but the old Time Lords (and a possibly guilt-ridden Doctor) should still consider the TARDIS stolen.

&gt; It's the difference between voice-commanding your computer and having a conversation with the hard-drive/CPU

Except (and I possibly have an unfair advantage here, I work in system administration) the computer can control the hard drive (and *is* the CPU and can control itself). The TARDIS Matrix (and there's an unfortunate name, given the word's history in the show) can hear him and affect ship's systems (as the Gaiman episode pointed out).

So, it's not just serious logical issues with the River/Doctor storyline. I reiterate, the show's authors are throwing in lots of cutesy lines which actually mess with the show's own continuity (not to mention the new series has destroyed the novels between old- and new- series).

It would be bad enough that Steven Moffat allowed this to happen as Executive Producer; but it's much worse given that:
- he's supposed to be a ""lifelong fan"" and
- he actually *wrote* the Hitler episode.

I just gave up on over-20-years of paying for reading DC (Green Lantern) comics because the idiot editors at DC decided to reboot the DC universe **again** just to pull some younger readers by the hormones. They've retconned most of their characters. I've got four-by-$400 cold-cast porcelain statues of the characters that are now all incorrect/non-canon thanks to the reboots. At least I'm saving money by not buying those comics now.

George Lucas has decided to eff up one of the few good classic scenes from ""Return Of The Jedi"". At least I'm saving money by not buying the Blu-Rays now.

Now ""lifelong fan Steven Moffat"" is continuing to damage ""Doctor Who"" similarly; there's 30-odd years of my fan history going similarly down the plughole.

The S.E.P. comes up in *Life, The Universe, and Everything*. Which was originally written by Adams as a Doctor Who serial called ""Doctor Who and the Krikkit Robots"" (or something like that).

Think about the structuring of the book...a vehicle (Bistromath) that can traverse space nearly instantly and which can also travel in time. And which also is eminently unnoticeable. Piloted by a wise old guiding figure who knows what's going on and is trying to stop a threat to the universe. Oh, and he's accompanied by two companions (one of whom, Arthur, acts as our eyes in on the strangeness).

I will always watch regardless of how arc driven an episode is, and each week I'm entertained, so to me it's not that big of a deal. The only thing that I've felt a little let down with is how rushed some of the ""big"" moments are in the long arcs. For example, in LKH [spoilers](/s ""they rushed through all of the Mels timeline just to get River Song introduced."") I think it would have been great to spread that out a little more, [spoiler](/s"" maybe not come right out and say that she's Melody Pond..."") make us wonder a while. Even the Silence stuff in TIA and Day of the Moon felt rushed, but I'm hoping that's part of something bigger in episodes yet to come. 

I get that some people don't care for River Song, and maybe that's why so many people have a problem with the long arc, since it's so River driven, but I think in general it's better than always having a ""monster of the week"" type episode. I think I would get bored without some sort of long story arc tying things together. Not that it would necessarily need to be as intricate as this one seems to be, just something to unify the series. But then again, most of the other shows I watch have long, season spanning arcs. Kind of makes things like a puzzle you have to put together, and keeps me engaged. Just my opinion.

It seemed to be over too fast, and I feel like there wasn't enough time put into telling us a story, where things change and problems are solved.

So, we have two central midfielders and Lucas has one nailed down; therefore, Charlie and Raul were competing for the other spot. Once Gerrard is fit he will compete for it too.

Thus, as Raul hasn't been fit recently, Charlie has made the position his own (and rightfully so, I'm glad to see him fighting for the spot and capitalizing on the other two's fitness). This has led to Raul being used as a right side midfielder. Now, we all know he is adept at the central role, and personally I dont think he's enjoyed being used out on the right. Doesn't have the pace for it, his crossing is decent but nothing special, and while he's fit he isn't one to chase down the opposing winger to force a mistake ala Kuyt.

I know he can be dangerous catching out the offside trap sometimes when someone passes over the top but when he has the ball he always seems to want to sprint straight along the byline.

I think Lennon's ability to take it past full-backs is fantastic right now. He can be nuisance when he wants, it's just he never seems to do the right thing with it.

I just wished we signed Adebayor permanately and he would actually make the effort every game. Between Bale, Lennon, Huddlestone and Modric we can provide for him from all angles and he should really have a good season if he tries.

true,arimnaes,null,null,"I wouldn't say that any of his episodes have been unqualified hits.  I suppose what I mean is that his episodes have been inconsistent in quality - they generally have some bad aspects that drag them down as well as some redeeming ones, and each episode averages out to being unremarkable.  At least, that's how I felt about The Unquiet Dead and The Idiot's Lantern.  I look more harshly on Victory of the Daleks, but I think I'm biased against that one because I thought the daleks were criminally overused during RTD's tenure and I was not at all happy to see them back so soon.

Night Terrors had no particular redeeming qualities, unfortunately.  The pacing was probably the worst aspect - to me, this felt like a first draft script, and one that desperately needed someone to come in and say ""Mark, this is an interesting idea, but nothing actually happens for the first twenty pages.""  Next worst would be the horror, which seemed like a greatest hits parade of devices that aren't scary anymore, especially not to a Doctor Who fan, because of how cliched they are.  The shadow moving at the end of the hallway, the creepy children's song, animate dolls, people getting sucked into things... it just seemed like a hodgepodge of unrelated, vaguely scary elements.

Nothing else managed to make up for these deficiencies because everything else was just average.  Or, put less charitably, forgettable.  The dialogue was perfunctory, lacking any particular wit or charm.  None of the regular characters (Amy, Rory, and the Doctor) seemed particularly invested in what they were doing.  When the best aspects of your script are the parts that seem phoned in rather than actively bad, you don't have a very good script.

If I purchased something at work, then I would need to physically copy the file to a computer at home.  Keeping all of my collections in sync was a huge pain in the neck.  


The major advantage to Zune is that you purchase the license to the media and then you can download it, or just play it from the cloud on a WP7 device, Windows Computer, or an xBox 360.  What this means to me, is that I no longer have to keep track of my collection and when I purchase something on any of the above mentioned devices, then it becomes available on all of the other devices over the cloud.  (WP7 requires you download video media from a Zune Client and then sync it to the phone)


I have a purchased a season pass to Doctor Who, so whenever a new episode becomes available, I can watch it from any of my 3 Windows Computers, or from either of the two TV's that I have xBoxes, and I don't have to copy a physical file around.

&gt;By 2033, in order to hold average crowding levels at today’s levels, approximately 50%, by increasing train length only, it would be necessary to increase the length of all WCML “fast” trains to 17 carriages (just over 400 metres).

&gt;Lengthening platforms to accommodate 400m trains may be possible at Euston and Manchester Piccadilly with very significant expenditure, engineering and compulsory land purchase; plans have been included in Appendix E show how this might be achieved at both locations.

In other words, it would be hugely expensive (if it is even possible), and would only prolong the inevitable for 20 years, at which point we'd need to build HS2 anyway.

Rory: What did you mean— what you said to Amy. There's a worse day coming for you?

River: When I first met the Doctor—a long long time ago—he knew all about me. Think about that. Impressionable young girl and suddenly this man just drops out of the sky. He's clever and mad and wonderful and... and knows every last thing about her. Imagine what that does to a girl.

Rory: I don't really have to.

River: Trouble is, it's all back to front. My past is his future. We're travelling in opposite directions. Every time we meet I know him more, he knows me less. I live for the days when I see him.

With that out of the way, this series has been a massive *miss* for me (I know, I know, that makes me a network-tv-watching, RTD-loving wee brain who is only in it for the comedy). I think Moffat's episodes, which I normally love to pieces (the stand alone episode 'Girl in the Fireplace' is my favourite ever, while I think 'The Pandorica Opens' is one of the best set-ups for a 2-parter ever) have been incredibly underwhelming this season, with the exception of his opening 2-parter being decent.

'A good man goes to war' was for me rushed, underwhelming and a bit of an 'all-over-the-place' episode. It wasn't terrible, but for Moffat standards it was poor.

'Lets Kill Hitler' seemed like a massively missed opportunity and again, my attention waned during the episode and on a re-watch I just didn't enjoy it.

I guess to summarize, I think during S5 his 'format' worked perfectly and created arguably my favourite series of 'New Who' yet, but during this series (and I know it's not over yet, but still) it's been an incredible backfire.

First thing's first: I love Moffat. And my love for him is not just limited to Doctor Who either, I love Sherlock and Jekyll too. He brings an atmosphere of breakneck adventure to his shows, he writes brilliantly charismatic characters and generally picks brilliant actors to portray them. Just for that, I am willing to cut him a LOT of slack on a LOT of other stuff.

Secondly, Moffat pisses me off. xD (lol) Not in general, but recently, in Doctor Who. The reason for this - River.

One thing to get out of the way: I don't HATE River...yet. It's MOFFAT who is making me hate River Song and this fact annoys me. He went and wrote a good character, then he went and found a brilliant, gorgeous actress to play her and then his brain drowned in his own drool or his hardon shot up so suddenly it struck him on the forehead and caused brain damage because now RIVER IS BLOODY EVERYWHERE. 

This I do not like. It's nice that we've got a good supporting character, but it's NOT nice that she goes and upstages absolutely everyone else in a TV show where she is...well...a SUPPORTING character. Long story arcs are fine. Long story arcs that elaborately tell about a character I'm increasingly less fond of will both bore me and make me dislike a good character.

Basically, the more Moffat keeps force-feeding us River, the more annoyed I will become with both of them even though I kind of...love them...separately...

...Yeah, no. It's gotta be River in the suit. The main question left is: was it young Melody (in the Astronaut suit they find ripped open) or older River? Something that's been puzzling me about the astronaut suit is this: when River and the Doctor find said astronaut suit ripped open, River speculates that whoever the girl was, she must be incredibly strong. Either she's *really* good at playing dumb, or there are two separate River timelines going on: one where she was raised by the Silence (and escapes from the astronaut suit, etc etc) and one where she wasn't.

But given that River has a time-head and can therefore remember things after timelines have been changed (as evidenced by her knowledge of the Doctor after he disappears in the Big Bang)... this doesn't really make sense. So I don't know what's going on.

Simply having your characters think really good thoughts, wish really hard, and spout some random technobabble is not a good way to end a show if you are trying to satisfy children *and* adults.   

I think my main bugbear with Gatis and RTDs writing is that their endings often seem pitched at kids only, whereas at least Moffat makes an effort to make his endings a gradual part of the programme.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"You were saying that regular teams can't afford to go out and do what Man City did. Surely, neither could regular teams go out and do what United, Liverpool, Spurs, Newcastle, Arsenal, Chelsea have been doing, can they? 

There seems to be this idea that these teams should be able to spend big money because they've earned it based on their past successes, but how are other clubs going to earn it if they aren't able to compete financially with the big clubs? Premier League teams receive an average of 45 million pounds of TV money. Getting into the Champion's League doubles that amount. 

Since 2002, which is when the Premier League were given 4 spots in the Champions League, United, Chelsea and Arsenal have qualified every year. Liverpool is the only member of the Top 4 to have dropped out 4 times over those 9 years. In 2002/2003, Liverpool lost the Champions League spot to Newcastle, who dropped out in the first round of qualifying next year. In 2004/2005, Everton qualified for the Champions League ahead of Liverpool, only to fail at the first hurdle the following year. For the next 4 years after that, the Top 4 were really the top 4 every season. It took Liverpool's unfortunate demise both on and off the pitch for Spurs and then City to break this stranglehold, and mmany people agree that it was more of Liverpool losing the Top 4 position than Spurs winning it. 

My point, is the in today's game, there is no way for any non-Top 4 club to win the Premiership unless they find a sugar daddy. If you worked your way up and developed your youth, what would happen? The top clubs would be snapping them up before you had a chance to improve. Spurs has managed to get close, and that has been the result of constant spending over the last few years. City have managed because they have spent the equivalent of what other clubs have spent in more than 10 years over a 3 year period. 

The only way for a club outside of the Top 4 to challenge for the title is through money. If your club does not offer European football, you need to counter that by offering higher wages. If your club does not have a ""glorious"" history of trophies like Liverpool and Europe, or one of sexy, passing football like Arsenal (Chelse had sexy football under Gullit), you pay them higher wages. Those are the rules of the game. 

Man City has not made things any different for the ""regular"" teams. The only change City has made is to the Top 4 (5 if you include Spurs). That's why City gets the most hate, because the Top 5 clubs in the Premier League have the most fans here. The strange thing is, nobody is complaining about Malaga. I'm pretty sure they are paying van Nisteelrooy wages that the other Spanish clubs that finished in the bottom half of the table can't afford either. Maybe in a couple of years when Malaga is challenging for the Primera Liga, there will be Valencia fans crying about how Malaga is ruining football, and Real Madrid officials saying they can't compete with Malaga's wages. 

I've always wondered whether if City would have been lauded if circumstances were different. Would you feel better about City if they took it easy for 3-4 years first before challenging for the top? How about if their owner was a super multi-billionaire from England instead of Abu Dhabi, would you like them more?

Anything controversial tends to raise the defensive hackles in people, unless you're incredibly tactful (clue: I'm not)  so that you're lucky if you get a hand-posted turd in a can, never mind a reasonable counter-debate.

For example, from the start, I was dead set against the River-definitely-kills-Rory idea, and often challenged people to make a convincing case for it, since I found it silly and filmsy at best, and said so.  Mostly, all I ever got was people mumbling something about him being a 'good man' and how River looked shocked when she met him that time, and how it basically boiled down to a hunch, and really it was 'wibbly wobbly' anyway and the Doctor Lies so who cares?  That was it as far as the defence went.  I gave up.

So that given, my personal suspicion is that any fans of Gatiss' writing for Who wouldn't really be involved enough to bother giving a detailed defence: they'd mutter something about how they just prefer 'fun romps' and 'supernatural spookiness' and don't like 'all that story arc-nonsense', and I'd realise just how frighteningly different everyone is when it comes to taste, but that I am Right and everybody except me is Wrong, and I'd shake my head sadly and go back to working on my plan to ask the Ultimate Question and bring Silence to the universe.

true,strolls,null,null,"I'm not clear on whether you're on a Virgin *cable* service or a FTTC / FTTH (Fibre to the cabinet / home) ADSL service.

In my town we only have ADSL, and that means that you get the same telephone line whichever ISP you connect to, but you get different speeds depending on the ISP. The difference in speeds boils down to how much the ISP spends on national and international peering - how much bandwidth they rent in fibre-optic cables across the Atlantic, for instance.

Broadband is a commodity market - everyone's selling more or less the same service, you more or less get what you pay for. Countless of my customers change broadband suppliers because they see it advertised on TV, there are ""faster"" promises and the adverts feature dancing elephants. It's important to remember - the more money an ISP spends on dancing elephants and TV advertising, the less money they have to spend on tech support staff and fibre-optic cables across the Atlantic.

Unfortunately, dancing elephants and TV advertising *works* - most of my customers continue to be taken in by it, and they'll buy internet service because a big ISP promises them a ""bargain deal"". Consistently you'll see better results from an ISP that no-one's ever heard of - you might have to spend £5 a month extra, but it's worth it, especially when you need tech support. A small reputable company will spend money on giving you a good service, not on dancing elephants.

I have a customer who moved from a standard Eclipse Internet service (""upto 8megs"" - he was probably only seeing 3megs) to BT's new ""Infinity"" service (FTTH, I think, a claimed 50megs). I think he had a second line put in, so he was able to swap between them in the first instance.

The BT 50meg service was visibly not as fast as the Eclipse 3meg service - a BT engineer attended to set him up, and my customer was able to show him, just by swapping his laptop's cable between the two routers, that the ""slower"" Eclipse service loaded pages obviously much faster than the new BT Infinity service (which he'd expected to be faster). The engineer shrugged and told him to phone tech support.

You should be able to check your router's web interface and see what the ""sync speed"" of the line is, and with a reputable ISP), you should get a fairly similar speed (±10%-20%) at Speedtest.net. With a cheap shitty ISP you'll see a *huge* difference.

IMO Eclipse or Plus.Net are reputable ISPs. BeUnlimted and O2 have good reputations. I *think* I remember being surprised how good Sky is. Andrews &amp; Arnold are *ridiculously* good, but can be expensive; if I had fibre FTTC or FTTH I would probably use A&amp;A because they allow terabytes of monthly transfer for next to nothing, as long as you do so *only* in off-peak times.

BT and TalkTalk are cheap shitty ISPs. Choosing them is asking for a shitty service.

I don't have much recent experience with Virgin, nor with Wanadoo (another big ISP that I've used a lot in the past and which happens to spring to mind).

You see cracks, you see them on lots of places, you see them really badly deleting them from the history(but people still remember them) and in the end, they will find a piece of tardis in one of the cracks(that doesn't mean that tardis was the cause of the cracks. I bet if i had a time machine, i could find a piece of a destroyed tardis, and the tardis wouldn't be a cause of why the tardis was destroyed) And in the end, we find out... that the silence did all that.

Melody was about seven years old when the events of DoTM happened.  And, I got the impression that Amy and Rory are pressuring the Doctor to find her BEFORE those events, while she's still a baby.

The problem is, let's say they find her while she's still an infant.  Taking her home to Leadworth means that season six is undone - if young Melody isn't held captive then Nixon never gets those phone calls and the gang doesn't go looking for her and River Song grows up in Leadworth rather than have her adventures with the Doctor (which seems contrary to her Time Lord DNA).

I think Amy and Rory are giving the Doctor the hard sell and the Doctor knows it can't happen but is just not telling them the hard truth.  Also, I think a part of Amy and Rory know that, too.  I think they understand the ramifications of crossing their own timeline to rescue Melody from the orphanage.

Still, as much as I wonder if that isn't a bit emotionally heavy for a kids' show, I agree that I would like to see that scene.  I'd like to see the Last Centurion try to tear the space time continuum apart to rescue his daughter from becoming a weapon only to find that he just can't.

I don't have a great deal of experience outside the south of the UK, sure. I don't know what working men's clubs are like in Yorkshire. Perhaps there are hardcore Labour racists there: I don't know, because I _haven't met them_. I have, however, met a lot of self-described Tories who had racist views.

I don't understand what you have a problem with. I'm not lying; I'm not suggesting all Tories are racist, far from it. I'm not suggesting it's impossible to be liberal and also racist, that's absurd. Based on my experience? This map stereotypes a real group of people who stereotype others, and it's funny. There's no need to get upset about it.

One of my biggest issues is being abandoned as a child and raised by a person who abused me -- and watching Amy and Rory go *oh well, whatever* about missing out on all the years of Melody's childhood is upsetting to me, in a much deeper way than I expected.

There are all kinds of personal horrors wound up in this plotline for me -- Amy was never aware that she was pregnant, and in a real-life situation, would probably not have bonded well with Melody, even if she hadn't been taken away. She has no real emotional investment in her ""daughter"" beyond the intellectual knowledge that Melody is hers. Lack of secure bonding with a caregiver in infancy is a strong indicator of later emotional problems -- and throwing around the word ""psychopath"" made me cringe and almost switch it off right then. And Rory seems to be following Amy's lead -- he went from blowing up Cyberships to get his child back to just nodding along with Amy and leaving Melody/River behind, tra la la.

None of this makes ANY emotional sense. People don't work like this.

They were denied the period of discovering/enjoying the pregnancy that most parents get and during which they connect with the life they are creating. When they DID find out about it, the baby was taken from them almost immediately. And to top it all off, River pops up and she's all like ""Yo, I'm your 50 year old daughter!"" I can plausibly see how they wouldn't FEEL like parents after all that.

However, Moffat's mistake was that he didn't take that into account from Amy's side in ""Good Man Goes To War"". She was shown to be an emotional, caring, fiercely protective mother who was then severely traumatized by her daughter's disappearance.

true,[deleted],null,null,"this is from another post and im too lazy to reconstruct it right now...but here are my thoughts.

There are a lot of things wrong with mels. One example: she was not at the wedding of amy and rory; if she was their best mate she would have been. and river knows not to cross her own timeline...so where the hell was mels. I think there is clearly something wrong if mels didn't go to the wedding, as she brought rory and amy together and both of them would expect her to be there.

Before the big bang, mels didn't exist and amy and rory were still together. i think amy having mels in her life as her best friend after the big bang messed up amy's relationship with rory, as who would think a boy palling around with two girls would be interested in one of them, so in essence mels was forced to bring them together. similarly, in the first episode with amy, no one ever mentioned her pretending to be with the doctor with anyone but rory, who dressed as the doctor.

this is a long shot and probably very off for the alternative universe: but who says river song has to ever exist in the universe before the cracks are sealed. in the first episode of the 5th season the big eyeball is on the other side of the wall and the prisoner escaped through this crack. the other side could be the alternative universe and it was eating at the universe we see in order to remove it from existence due to the future problems that occur, which could be something that destroys both universes.

the alternate world could very well be that river song never exists in the way we think. In this universe the doctor saves the child and it is returned to amy and rory. I could see the doctor changing everything to force this alternative universe to happen [going to the other side of the cracks and allowing the other world to be completely erased]. When the pandorica flys into the sun the doctor enters the alternative universe, as it is not only to save himself, but to completely erase the other world and prevent all the destruction river song causes after being manipulated by the silence. Who is to say that the doctor that continues to reappear during the pandorica episode isn't from the future...200 years into the future after everything has happened and before he dies. He could have brought river song with him from this universe to the alternative universe some point before the big bang 2, knowing he has to erase the other universe. At the point, she becomes a good friend of his and he doesn't want to lose her. However, she still knows at that point everything that she has done in the alternative universe. On the other side, she willingly goes into storm cage because she knows the problems she caused in the alternative universe; she commits some act of violence that causes them to incarcerate her. Once both worlds are sealed off, amy's memory can be restored as the cracks simply never appeared because the alternative universe didn't exist. It was far too convenient for amy to have simply 'wished the doctor back' and for river to have known to give amy the book to get him back. the doctor could have just come back willingly because he knew amy would remember him when river gave her the book. he didn't want to miss out on being at his companions wedding.

here's the transcript from the prequel:

*TARDIS interior. It’s dark, empty. The phone rings. No body picks up, so it goes through to answering machine*
**The doctor (pre-recorded message)**: “Oh! Blimey, ohhhkay, probably leave a message at the tone or something. Sorry, I wasn’t really trying to do this, I was looking for the BRAKES—”
**Beep**. *[The camera is showing close ups of the TARDIS console.]*
**Amy**: “Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me? Are you ever going to hear this? You don’t even know you’ve got an answerphone. How can you be so clever and so completely stupid at the same time? Well, if you can hear this, please just pick up the phone. Don’t get confused – I’m not invisible or trapped in a space bottle or something, I’m just talking on the answerphone. So just pick up the phone.”
**No one picks up**. 
“You said you’d find my baby. You said you’d find Melody. Have you found her? Because you promised. I know she’s gonna be okay, I know she’ll grow up to be River, but – that’s not the point. I don’t wanna miss all those years, you know? I can’t stand it. Can’t. Please, Doctor, please. Okay? Phone me back when you know something? Please, Doctor, at least do that. As soon as you know, okay? All right. Bye.”
*The camera moves around the TARDIS and reveals the Doctor, whos been there all the time listening to Amy. He hangs his head in shame; he hasn’t found Melody.*

true,ananinginaneana,scottish,Ex-Exile,"When it comes to the involvement of the Scottish government that article is full of as much poo as any bucket in Barlinnie or Sauchton. For example, it claims that Prof. Sikora's report supported al Megrahi's application. It did nothing of the sort. He was the Libyan governments consultant and had nothing to do with the evaluation of al Megrahi's condition.

The article quotes an unnamed ""senior official"" - that's called hearsay and has absolutely no value. The discussion, in fact, took place on 2 Nov 2007 and was between Jack Straw and Kenny MacAskill. Three separate matters were on the agenda; al Megrahi, firearms legislation and the Scotland Act/Sommerville.

Kenny MacAskill subsequently [wrote to Jack Straw on 6 Dec 2007](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/legal/lockerbie/correspondence/UK-gov) and stated that the Scottish government's position remained unchanged - hardly the stance of someone who was prepared to negotiate.

On 19 Dec 2007 Jack Straw replied to Kanny MacAskill informing him that the PTA was going ahead without an exclusion for al Megrahi (which the Scottish government had not asked for, rather they had requested an exclusion for anyone convicted of involvement with the bringing down of Pan-AM flight 103) and went on to say:-

&gt;[You also asked me on November 2 about two separate matters....](http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/docs/20071219-jack-straw-to-kenny-macaskill-libya-prisoner-transfer-agreement.pdf)  (last paragraph)

So it was clear in Jack Straw's mind (at least on 19 December 2007) that these were three separate issues which just happened to come up for discussion at the same meeting.

true,suuuuuu,smith,Smith,"Series One/Two:  
  
* Madame de Pompadour: Repetitive, yes, but in the context of the episode, very moving.  
  
* The Impossible Planet: Great song, the music in these two episodes set the tone and atmosphere brilliantly.  One of the best scored episodes because of this song.  
  
* Doomsday: I'll let you guess.  
  
Series Three  
  
* All the Strange, Strange Creatures: Lame title, but awesome, exciting track.  
  
* The Doctor Forever:  Unbelievable.  There's a bit of it in ""The Family of Blood"" that's not in the soundtrack that is incredible.  
  
* The Dream of a Normal Death: For a while I thought this was about the Doctor and/or Jack.  It's sad and speaks to a common theme of the show.  
  
* The Futurekinda/The Master Vainglorious/The Master Tape/YANA:  All from the series finale, all fun and exciting--the drums (YANA) and guitar are awesome.  
  
* This Is Gallifrey: Our Childhood, Our Home: Possible the most popular track from Doctor Who.  So good.  
  
Series Four (Haven't listened to as much either)  
  
* Life Among the Distant Songs: I think this one was played a lot at emotional/climactic moments.  Not my favorite, but nice.  
  
* The Doctor's Theme Series 4: Starts with something similar to the vocals that were unbelievably perfect at many points during the season (ie River tells the Doctor his name).  Awesome.  A great theme for Tennant as his tenure comes to a close--perfect for his degeneration (Time Lord Victorious, etc.).  *Does anyone know if there is actually a song in the soundtrack that contains the music when River tells the Doctor his name?*  
  
* The Greatest Story Never Told: Gets pretty epic, especially around 4:00.  
  
Series Five (My favorite overall)  
  
* Down to Earth: Perfect for Smith's entrance.  
  
* I Am the Doctor: 'Nuff said.  
  
* Amy In the TARDIS: The last 1:30.  Holy trash.  
  
* A Useful Striker: The soccer/football scene.  Fun and exciting.  
  
* Words Win Wars: A fitting track for an epic scene.  
  
* The Life and Death of Amy Pond: Perfect.  Just so perfect, for the scene, the episode.  Great title, so moving, amazing.  
  
* The Sad Man With a Box: One of my favorites.  So dark and epic and sad.  Perfectly used in the scene.

true,LaMcD,null,null,"I don't think it's anywhere near his 'last chance'. At 22, Jay is still young, &amp; considering his rapid growth in the last year or so (I didn't think he'd ever properly break into the first team just last summer) there's strong reason to believe he's still developing. For his role in the squad, a backup DM, he's done as well as anyone can expect of him &amp; looks like he will be a good squad player for a number of years, it's unreasonable to expect every player to be challenging for a place in the first XI.

I actually the think that the main goal of the academy, in terms of producing players for the first team, is not to make stars like Gerrard, Fowler &amp; Owen, but to make players who can fill in rotation &amp; backup roles. Look at the famed United batch of the 90s. Beckham, Scholes &amp; Giggs took all the headlines, but I'd argue that the likes of the Nevilles, Butt, O'Shea, Brown &amp; Fletcher were more valuable to the club. Players that were never going to be big stars, but filled vital roles &amp; gave lots of years of service, what's more they were loyal to the club that gave them their opportunity, &amp; weren't going to get bored of the bench after a season or two &amp; move on.

By having these roles filled by youth products rather than imports, think of how much money Ferguson saved that could be used to buy star players who massively improved the team. One of the big criticisms of Rafa when he was in charge was that he wasted money on deadwood like Josemi, Kromkamp, Nunez, Dossena etc. But he had to buy these players to fill out the squad otherwise any passing injury or suspension crisis would leave the squad completely decimated &amp; we'd have had to play our U18's. (see: Arsenal, August 2011!) Imagine how much more successful we'd have been if we could've used academy products to fill the backup roles &amp; had the extra few million we needed to bring in the likes of Alves, Malouda &amp; Villa. Actually, don't, it's depressing... :'(

If Jay, or any other academy product, only ever turns into an average player who fills out the squad for 5-6 seasons &amp; provides good service whenever called upon before leaving for some mid-table side, that should be viewed as a success, rather than a failure. We need our academy to produce as many of those kinds of players as possible.

EDIT: Christ this has gotten long, **TL;DR:** Spearing is a decent enough player who fills an important role in the team &amp; saves us a lot of money on bringing in average players to fill out the squad (see: Christian Poulsen), he's doing a great job so far.

After being on JSA for 8 months after uni - I can tell you that it is a small minority that ruin it for the majority. Yes there are a fair few doing eff all and living on 'your taxes'. However I believe that if you concentrate on this mentality it is only clouding your judgement. Also there are an even smaller minority actually living on a similar wage to those who, like you, work. I'd far rather be in your situation, paying an annoyingly high amount of tax but getting a decent(ish) wage. Me personally, I'm on less than a job seeker some weeks if there is no overtime... And there is a big streak of no overtime coming up too.

My point, initially, was targeting the extremely wealthy. The ones who can publish more negative stories about Chav and Chavy than their friends Rich and Richer. 

For me there is far more in this than 'some laws and less benefits'. I mean take a look at some British icons... Like Rooney for example. Prostitutes, cheating on your wife, flashy cars etc. What sort of an example is this for children? Even our PM - hiring Andy Coulson and being pally with people who have paid MET officers for 'stories'. I think capitalism can work, but it has to be as close to 'fair' as possible.

true,ananinginaneana,scottish,Ex-Exile,"I'll own up to being an SNP supporter - just for the record - and I hope that hasn't biased my view of the situation. This has been a major issue from when the PTA became known until now and has continually been used as a stick to beat the SNP with - so yes, fairly close to my heart. The decision did raise serious questions in my mind and I was concerned that MacAskill had made the wrong decision (though I was initially ambivalent as to what happened to Megrahi himself).

It was quite difficult getting hold of the rules on compassionate release, but when I managed to find them that then raised the question of how the nature of the crime didn't prevent release. That was only explained when I was directed to the Mitchell article. It seems that MacAskill was in a legal straightjacket tailored for him by his predecessors and that he has just had to make the best of a bad situation.

I suppose he could have gone out on a limb, refused release, and face being challenged in the courts. Jack Straw was no stranger to having his decisions overturned in court - the difference being there was a life a stake, and if Megrahi had died while an appeal was pending there would have been hell to pay. In any event we do not have the death penalty in this country and Megrahi was only sentenced to 27 years - not the rest of his natural life. There is a presumption in this country, as well as the rest of Europe, against prisoners dying in prison.

No one has ever explained why the decision was wrong. They have stated their displeasure at the decision, said it was wrong, but never given any legal basis for their viewpoint. Probably because Mitchell's analysis is correct and the decision was unavoidable. The opponents of the decision have been left trying to smear the SNP with accusations based on half truths and outright lies. That then lead to me trying to understand just what had gone on. 

The sad thing is that the Scottish government put all the information they were able to in the public domain from the outset - so half the claims made in the media were easily disprovable. The only details not made available are due to the refusal of the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, US Dept of State and, in the case of his medical records, al Megrahi. And the only way of linking the Scottish government with anything dodgy, after all this time and a number of enquiries, are the recollections of an unnamed official of someone else's telephone conversation.

The combination of taxes and welfare system left to us by the previous administration puts many of the working poor in a very bad position and makes it financially sensible to exploit the system by avoiding work. (This could be fixed with a £10K personal allowance, and a 10p tax band to £20K. Poor people have no money, don't tax them or you will need to pay for a system to give them money back).

We are then left with a hardcore minority of people who simply don't want to work, and don't see why they should. And the only system I could think of that might work in this case is food stamps instead of cash. You do have to make a cost benefit analyses though, as it may well cost more to deal with this tiny minority than it would to just pay them off.

I don't think that happens a lot anymore, those who were here for the money left. Those who want to live here brought their families over and don't send money out.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"I understand and respect the rights of pacifists to choose to oppose all violence, and clearly if everyone adopted the same position, what a wonderful world that would be.  But I agree that war is _occasionally and under a very limited range of circumstances_ necessary.  Sadly, in the world today, the vast majority of wars are fought for the enrichment of States or elites within them, for territory/control of territory, or for reasons of political expediency.  

I can understand the anger against soldiers who form the cutting edge of the knife, but I also agree it's generally misdirected (except in specific instances of war crimes etc.), since it's generally political and economic elites who wield it, and more directly the managerial elites of the military who provide the context in which soldiers kill, and decide how and who they kill.  When professional soldiers killed professional soldiers as diplomacy by other means that was one thing, but when soldiers kill (as they increasingly do) civilians, especially in autocratic regimes where the civilians bear little or no responsibility for the political and diplomatic actions of their elites, right-thinking people are repulsed by it, but it's a shame that that free-floating anger too often settles on those at the sharp end rather than those who created the situation which results in needless carnage.

It'd doubtless be impractical, and probably dangerous to go back to a time where we no longer have standing armies, but we definitely need to consider options to make war less of an attractive option for political and economic elites - in a better world, perhaps, we'd have every member of the cabinet and boardroom member of a major company have to have at least two family members serving in the frontline military!

We need him to have the perfect season really - good enough to score the goals that push us properly into CL contention, but not quite brilliant enough to attract the attentions of the bigger clubs capable of beating our offer - but there likely wouldn't be too many of these interested anyway.
