true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Where is the meaningful difference between taking away a person's freedom by sending them to jail, and killing that person, such that our justice system is fit for prescribing one but not the other?

I'm not sure what you mean by meaningful difference. However, surely it is better a person is released from jail, with financial recompense per year they spent in incarceration, especially if put there through malfeasance - than sending a 'sorry we killed your loved one' letter. Would you consider this to be meaningfully different?

I take issue with them both being violations of human rights. Everyone has the right to life - killing someone, albeit through consent, is a violation of that right. 

Sure, everyone has the right to a **fair trial**, but this doesn't necessarily mean all erroneous convictions are a violation of that right. I suppose it comes down to the definitions of what is *fair*.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by meaningful difference. [...]

&gt; I take issue with them both being violations of human rights. Everyone has the right to life - killing someone, albeit through consent, is a violation of that right.

By meaningful difference, I mean that there is obviously a difference between custodial and capital punishments, but I'm asking you to identify the relevant difference between the two that makes one justifiable as an outcome of a fallible justice system, and yet not the other.

Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights grants everyone the right to life, liberty and security of person.

If we are to reject capital punishment on the grounds that innocent people may have their right to life violated, surely we should also reject custodial punishment for fear that innocent people may have their right to liberty violated?

You are assuming, perhaps intuitively, that the right to life is more important than the right to liberty, but is that necessarily true? I'm sure you've heard the term ""live free or die"" before; what of the person for whom a prolonged custodial sentence is a fate worse than death? What of those individuals that believe in some form of afterlife?

How do you compensate the person that rejects materialism, and takes the offer of financial compensation as an insult, for the violation of their right to liberty?

&gt; However, surely it is better a person is released from jail, with financial recompense per year they spent in incarceration, especially if put there through malfeasance - than sending a 'sorry we killed your loved one' letter. Would you consider this to be meaningfully different?

Granted, as far as wrongly convicted individuals and their loved ones are concerned, the former would *usually* be preferable. However, we observe that wrongful convictions are, fortunately, a rare occurrence. They are certainly the exception rather than the norm.

In reality, the 1% that were wrongly convicted are free to be released from custodial sentences because the 99% that were rightly convicted have not been served with the justice that a majority of the population believe should be dealt.

If you'll pardon an analogy, this is equivalent to arguing in favour a law prohibiting people from getting out of bed in the morning (i.e. prohibiting capital punishment), for fear that 1% of people who get out of bed (are prescribed capital punishment) will be hit by a bus and killed while going about their daily business. (were wrongfully convicted)

You are effectively arguing in favour of such a law by saying that, from the perspective of that 1%, being prohibited from getting out of bed in the morning is a fate better than getting up and being hit and killed by the bus.

What you are neglecting to take into account is that the overwhelming majority of people want the ability to get out of bed in the morning, and that there are significant costs involved in prohibiting the other 99% from doing so.

In terms of retributive value, there is an enormous difference between custodial and capital punishments. For the victims of crime, and their loved ones, the knowledge that the perpetrator of a crime that may have changed their life, taken the life of a loved one, etc. is often too much to bear.",0,1312483547,null,0,false,0,c2a4zu4,t3_j8m72,t1_c2a4zu4,t1_c2a4ebm,1427431384,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Centre forward pissed me off.

He's younger, but his production in a Chelsea shirt, especially compared to Drogba's, should make Drogba the automatic first choice. Torres needs to prove he can perform before he starts over him.

- Nope, never had any contact from the club but been told by one or two that the blog (along with other sites) do get read by people working there. Not for a second suggesting the chairman reads it over his morning corn flakes, but I've seen other blogs contact for posting 'allegations' so THFC must read through all the forums and message board and blogs just in case of anything libellous. I'm hoping Spurs have a sense of humour. I'm sure they do. Levy included.

- Tbh, the whole blogging scene has exploded in a good way since twitter took over as the most social of networks. I know a lot of them (online) and its basically brought me together with a few non-bloggers for the podcast, like tehtrunk. Really think there's a rich vibrant variety of tottenham blogs - all giving something different and everyone is very supportive of each other. Good times.

- In a nutshell, he made an accusation. I laughed it off. He took some pot shots. I ignored most of them. So did everyone else. And tbh, we've not had any contact for several months. It's all about ego mostly. Silly, stupid...and when you look at every other blog out there - there is simply no bickering over competition. Which is how it should be. We're just fans with a blog, we're not anything special. Just people with a bit of time on our hands.

- We'll challenge for top 4. Have to aim for top 2. We need to be completely focused and competitive and think with some signings we will. A forward, a midfielder, a CB. Top 4 and the FA Cup. And regardless of what Redknapp says, a good run in the Europa League.

&gt;Do you have them for the driest, dullest matters of legality?

I suppose in an ideal world, the population would be intelligent enough and motivated enough to learn about even the dullest policies and make an informed decision. Sadly this isn't the case and I agree that it would be very tricky to find an unbiased way of deciding what issues the public are ""allowed"" to vote on.

&gt;They're expensive and take a long time to arrange. That makes the process of government overly cumbersome and somewhat of a burden.

Here I must disagree with you. I can't believe that the cost of holding a series of referenda once a year would be at all significant in the grand scheme of things. The first one or two might be very pricey, but if we used electronic voting machines and standardised procedures, where's the cost? Or they could be simply done at the same time as other elections; we'd still manage a set every five years.

&gt;People are stupid.

Sigh.. all too true. I could easily list half a dozen things I wouldn't want Daily Mail readers to decide. Surely it would be worth getting true pictures of public opinion every so often though?

Obviously, I'm not a big fan.

However, what I'm trying to do is show you what you seem to be missing in the new seasons. I'm trying to show you, through comparisons, the difference in the two styles. Especially because I'd hate for Who to be ruined for you, and you to stop watching, just because you don't see the character development. Of course, at the end of the day, if you don't like it then there's nothing anyone can do until Moffat eventually retires and maybe someone closer to your liking takes up the helm.

Again, I'm not questioning your intelligence, or saying RTD is for dumb people, or that there's anything inherently wrong with his style. Well, except for his plot devices, but those are a different matter! I personally don't like his character style because I feel his characters are trying to hard to push themselves on me. That's my personal preference, but at the same time I didn't let that stop me from watching his era, even multiple times.

Rose in for BAE every now and again and Walker in for Corluka (and then probably replace him).

Midfield is tricky because I rate Huddlestone, so would have Hudd and Sandro rotate.

Gallas covering King. We all know real life is a bit different to that.

Up top, you get to see why we need a forward. I'd have liked to see Pav with a prolonged run in the side. Don't see it happening and I'd not be best pleased with this line-up and would require that signing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; If we are to reject capital punishment on the grounds that innocent people may have their right to life violated, surely we should also reject custodial punishment for fear that innocent people may have their right to liberty violated?

No, because quite clearly whilst one can be rectified to some extent, the other is completely irreversible. 

&gt; You are assuming, perhaps intuitively, that the right to life is more important than the right to liberty, but is that necessarily true? I'm sure you've heard the term ""live free or die"" before; what of the person for whom a prolonged custodial sentence is a fate worse than death? What of those individuals that believe in some form of afterlife?

I am not assuming this at all, I do not believe the government and the state should have the right to take a citizens life.

&gt; If you'll pardon an analogy, this is equivalent to arguing in favour a law prohibiting people from getting out of bed in the morning (i.e. prohibiting capital punishment), for fear that 1% of people who get out of bed (are prescribed capital punishment) will be hit by a bus and killed while going about their daily business. (were wrongfully convicted)

You've lost me on this. It appears to be a rather ridiculous (Edit: and confusing) analogy.

&gt; that there are significant costs involved in prohibiting the other 99% from doing so.

But if you are alluding to the idea that the death penalty is cheaper than life imprisonment then I would say you only have to look at the United States to see this is not the case.

&gt; In terms of retributive value, there is an enormous difference between custodial and capital punishments. For the victims of crime, and their loved ones, the knowledge that the perpetrator of a crime that may have changed their life, taken the life of a loved one, etc. is often too much to bear.

I've always been a Star Trek fan because I see it as character driven, which is what I saw in Series 1-4.  Plus, it was damn fun!  I'm not having fun right now; it is a chore.  This style is seemingly not for me.

The one exception was The Lodger which I loved. The difference?  Character relationships.  The humans' actions affecting how the Doctor saw the situation, the Doctor affecting their relationship, and how the couple coming together in the end basically ""saved"" the day.  I loved that episode, the only one I've loved so far in Series 5.  Watched the first part of the season finale last night, and went to bed without interest in watching the second part.  The only reason I keep trying is that I want it to work, want to recapture the feeling and fun I had in 1-4.  If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen, and I'm okay with that.

&gt;You are now connected with James Goodwyn

James Goodwyn: *Hello, you're through to James Goodwyn on the WebChat team. I'm here to assist you with your online application and provide information on our products. How may I help you today?*

Simon: Hi

Simon: I've got 2 accounts with you

Simon: My main account is a 'graduate/student' account

Simon: and I have a step account for paying some bills

James Goodwyn: *Excellent, Simon how may I assist you?*

Simon: My concern is your recent changes to the terms

Simon: I now have to pay in £750 every 3 months

Simon: I am a student and my source of income is the loans from the SLC

Simon: which does not pay me every 3 months

Simon: How am I supposed to deposit £750 every 3 months?

James Goodwyn: *Thank you for your query, it takes into account that you may not have Loans into account during summer sessions, so you would lose any benefits.*

Simon: Exactly. Your service is designed for and provided only to students. All of which will have this problem. How do we avoid losing our overdrafts, among other benefits?

James Goodwyn: *As I said it takes into account you would be able to put the loan there during summer sessions, so do not worry as you will not lose benefits in that case*

Simon: No. We receive our loan in 3 parts: October, January, and April. The last part is gone by the end of June. We are not lent any money over the summer, so we have nothing to deposit.

James Goodwyn: *Your best step forward is to step into your local branch and they can explain to in detail,*

Simon: I'm not having any trouble understanding, I simply wish to know how Natwest expects us to continue depositing money we do not have over the summer period.

Simon: The last loan (of the academic year) is in april. This is used to pay rent until the end of June.

Simon: What do we then do for the period July, August and September?

James Goodwyn: *What is it that you like to hear, Simon?  I have said to you as, it has been taken into consideration, and they now most Student do not get loans in summertime and that is fine you are not penalized if you do not at that time*

Simon: Thank you for that information, is that stated legally anywhere? I cannot find it anywhere in the most recent changes to the terms.

James Goodwyn: *As I said you can speak with an adviser and they can provide the information that you need*

Simon: Thanks, but can't you?

Simon: A direct quote from your terms and conditions:

James Goodwyn: *Can I what?*

Simon: ""You must use your Student Account as your main current account by depositing at least £750 every 3 months and making at least 9 debit transactions every 3 months. If at any time you stop using your account as your main current account then we reserve the right to remove any interest free overdraft on your account.""

Simon: While I understand what you are saying

Simon: That's not what they legally binding document says

James Goodwyn: *No, we do not have access to the terms and conditions there it should be sent to in correspondence through the post.*

James Goodwyn: *I can only explain to you what you we have been told, in response to your question.  If you are not satisfied with the answers, which I can understand, your best step forward would be to speak with Student adviser, Simon*

James Goodwyn: *Is there anything else that I can help you with today?*

Simon: Ok I appreciate that

Simon: I think I will have to have a quick chat in-branch

Simon: I appreciate that this change is to stop people abusing the free overdraft

James Goodwyn: *Excellent, Simon and I was not trying to give you the run around on that as we have tons of question to that concern*

James Goodwyn: *We are here Monday thru Friday 8-8 and Saturday 10-6 if you need any assistance. Have an excellent evening!*

Simon: But it is much too harsh: If, as has happened on more than one occasion in the past, our loan is delayed then we are unable to make a deposit and lose our overdraft etc. through no fault of our own.

Simon: Which could be disastrous for someone who relies on it.

Simon: Sorry, thanks for your time.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; No, because quite clearly whilst one can be rectified to some extent, the other is completely irreversible.

The point I made in the next passage of mine you quoted is that, in many cases, the deprivation of an individual's right to liberty cannot in fact be rectified. We cannot, as outside observers, state whether liberty or life is more valuable to another person, and although admittedly unlikely, it is *plausible* that the former be valued more than the latter by someone.

&gt; But if you are alluding to the idea that the death penalty is cheaper than life imprisonment then I would say you only have to look at the United States to see this is not the case.

I wasn't actually considering the financial aspect, although that's an interesting point you raise. I was alluding more to costs sustained by the rest of society due to a perceived lack of justice. 

If a majority of people believe child killers should be given the death penalty — as the various polls suggest — but they are given prison sentences instead, that's great for the 1% that were wrongly convicted, but not for the majority of society, whom would prefer their notion of justice be enacted on 100% of those convicted, even if it is at the expense of that 1%.

There is a balance to strike here, and this is why your faith in the justice system is relevant. In an anarchic society, would the fact that no one was being wrongly convicted of crimes make up for the fact that there was no law and order at all?

&gt; I am not assuming this at all, I do not believe the government and the state should have the right to take a citizens life.

This is where I agree wholeheartedly with you. There *are* reasons to oppose capital punishment, and a principled view that the right to life is absolutely inviolable is one of those. I'm with you there.

The possibility of wrongful convictions, however, is not a valid reason to oppose capital punishment.

Be it rolling out a brand to another continent (see Starbucks in Australia) or a governmental policy (see USA for healthcare), social, political, and technical issues can stand in the way of a seemingly flawless idea.

That said, the hard line of Drug Policy does't work, hasn't worked and shows no intention of working in the future without a radical rethink, so a review should take place, and a proper one this time round, not a rubber stamp like in 2010.

Drugs are fine, some are dangerous but so is driving a car, its all about migrating risk, now as I said, I personally believe drugs are fine in small quantities like alcohol and can be used as a way to enjoy ones self, but can also be abused like alcohol, but while the general 420 friendly society will focus on how drugs policy is great and will affect them I shall be rooting for the Medical grounds of policy.

And no, not the USA's wishy washy ""Medical Grass"", I'm talking about people with real problems like Suicide headaches (they are call that because no amount of drugs can stop the pain and cause many people to commit suicide to escape them, its likened to having undrugged childbirth  according to those who have experienced childbirth and suicide headaches.  They come frequently and the only thing to do is grab the oxygen tank and start huffing.  But a testing shows the drug LSD, classified as A (which means no scientific or health purpose/benefit) stops the constant headaches in 5 out of 6 of the patients, some for months after the trial ended.

That's partly because we have the strictest licensing laws of any European country.  In continental Europe alcohol is available more or less any time of day or night from bars, cafes restaurants, etc.  As a result, people tend to consume alcohol (or not) as part of whatever else they're doing (eating, socialising, etc).  In contrast the British licensing laws limited the consumption of alcohol to lunchtime/evening time slots, and fostered a binge drinking culture where people ""go out to the pub"" with the soul purpose of getting drunk as quickly as possible (i.e. before the pub shuts).

The Tardis would be pulled to Wardenclyffe by the telsa coil harmonics, which also opens the original rift (ala torchwood) allowing in aliens that the doctor calls Ma'tans. The Dr meets the inventor, who introduces himself only as Nikola. There'd also be lots of running from the aliens. As they try and close the rift together, it becomes unstable, as the other end of the rift is suddenly closed. Nikola picks up information from the Dr, as the rift throws them around in time slightly. Like playing with his sonic screwdriver (And he accidently places it on a building setting up vibrations that almost cause it to collapse.). Nikola incorrectly calls the aliens 'martians', that hears of an energy in the aether (the eye of Rassalon) that powers the tardis, and alludes to several of this other inventions. 

Finally the Dr is able to make contact with the ma'tans on the other side of the rift by modifying a radio and convinces them to tune their side of the coil to stabilize the rift into a conduit so their trapped people can return home. The Ma'tans go home.

Finally the Doctor collapses the field of the coil with the sonic screwdriver, which blows up Wardenclyffe, sealing the rift in an electrical storm.

As the doc leaves, Amy asks who he was, and the doctor says ""oh, just some inventor chap, I expect"", (close shot) with a knowing smile.

There is a pull back reveal as the authorites arrive at the ruins of the lab. His assitant runs up and asks ""Dr Tesla, are you ok""
""Yes, I heard Martians on my radio, and know of a secret power in the universe, and I know how to collapse a building with sound harmonics. Come, we have much work to do!""

the one where Donna and the Doctor
fought the giant killer bees
And it got me thinking man,
If I was forced to date a man
then surely he would be
the only one for me

we'd fly round in his TARDIS
through the rifts of space and time
and through it all I'd know that
I'd be his and he'd be mine

Oh Doctor won't you mend my broken heart
and tell me that we'll never be apart?
If there were a race I'm sure I'd win the pennent
for the man love that would come from David Tennant

Intelligence unmatched
I'm sure he'd be the perfect catch
the sonic screwdriver to save me from despair
Although I must disclose
that he may have a thing for Rose
with two, surely he'd have one heart to spare

-Doctor Who theme-

And although it may be slightly awkward
when its said from you to me
there comes a point where each man finds his sexuality
And though he'd try his dardest
just to get me in the mood
I'd find him better naked
with a vagina and some boobs
And I spose that really matters
when it all comes down to it
we could have no Homan babies
So I guess alone I'll sit

He holds up a strange flashing circuit and examines it closely, then connects it to a larger control panel. He lets out a nervous sigh, and flips a switch. Large bolts of lighting shoot between the two coils, and down onto the stage. It's an amazing fireworks show of blue and white energy, and you hear the air crackle around him. The fizzing energy is followed by a grinding, whirring sound from within the console. Tesla bends over to take a look and try to figure out what's wrong. As he puts his ear to the console, he realizes that isn't where the noise is coming from. The noise is coming from the stage. A strange blue box begins to materialize between the arcs of lightning...

Okay, I've never written fanfiction before, but this is starting to sound tempting. After all, RTD and Moffat both got their start writing fanfiction.

**EDIT:** It's 4:00 AM, what have I got to lose? Worst case scenario, I delete it in the morning:

**Alternate Currents**

The Tunguska Event was actually a Time Agency vessel crashing into Siberia. Tesla acquires the ship and strips it down piece-by-piece. He accidentally activates the transponder and summons the Doctor. The Doctor was in mid-flight at the time, so being pulled out of the vortex damages the TARDIS and now he can't get it to turn on. After some banter between the Doctor and Tesla (who can't keep his eyes off Amy, of course), they start looking through the various parts of the Time Agency ship to try to find something to use for the TARDIS. 
Amy picks up a time watch and disappears. She finds herself many years in the future, still in the lab. Tesla is an old man, very old, and he's happy to see her. He tells her that he and the Doctor spent many, many years trying to fix the TARDIS to rescue her. Eventually, the Doctor ventured out to find help with Torchwood, and he never returned (presumably captured by them, as he was still considered their enemy at the time). 

As Amy begins to mourn the loss of the Doctor, Tesla's eyes light up when he realizes she has brought the time watch with her. He takes her into a back room and shows her that he has built his own TARDIS (after all, he's had years to study the original, still broken down on his old stage). It's just an empty shell, however, lacking access to the time vortex. Tesla manages to jury-rig the time watch to his steampunk TARDIS, but before they can do anything else, Torchwood busts into the lab and starts messing things up. Tesla manages to fight them off with his lightning towers, while Amy runs back to the Neo-TARDIS and travels forward in time. 

She's in the 52nd century, and Tesla's lab has become a Time Agency base. Everyone seems to recognize her immediately, somehow, and she explains everything that's happened. The captain of the base takes her to a vault, which scans her biometrics and opens for her. Inside is a TARDIS crystal. He says that it's been there for a long time, and that the Time Agency has been waiting for her to come retrieve it. They send her back in time to the lab, just before the TARDIS materialized on stage. She watches herself and the Doctor arrive, then she sees herself disappear. She steps out of the shadows holding up the TARDIS crystal. 

She explains the events of the day while the Doctor uses the crystal as a sort of jump-start for the TARDIS. They thank Tesla for his time and Amy gives him an emotional hug. They walk into the TARDIS and dematerialize while Tesla waves them goodbye, still unable to believe the events of the last hour. He walks out of the room, then hears the TARDIS again. Wondering what they could have possibly forgot that would require them to return, he runs back into the room in time to see the Neo-TARDIS sitting on the stage. It has a note on it that says, ""I think this is yours. Thanks. - Amy""

The Doctor and Amy sit on the steps in front of the TARDIS console. Amy's talking about how Tesla might just be the only man she's met who's smarter than the Doctor, and it's a shame he was born in such a backward time.  She couldn't stand the idea of a such a brilliant man being confined to 19th century Earth, and she knows he's smart enough to stay out of trouble and screw up the timestream. She says that before she left the 52nd century, she set a countdown on the time watch so that the Neo-TARDIS would appear in Tesla's lab right after they left.

Like this chap, you get people who are opposed to people being ""forced"" into accepting it. They don't like gay marriage because of 'religious conscience', and I've even heard David Starkey (*himself* a gay man who was homosexual who lived through a very tough time for gays) criticise those who ""try to force morals on others"" (paraphrased).

What the feck... He called it ""forced morality"" when a B&amp;B couple are fined for not letting a gay couple stay because they weren't properly married (in their eyes).

This is a bullshit argument. Replace the gay couple with a black (hetero) couple, or even a mixed race couple. No-one refusing service or not approving of black people would **ever** have someone arguing in their favour claiming that morals were being forced on them. Anyone who did would be ostracised and rightly so.

Let's see how that works:

&gt; While some in society approve of **mixed race** relationships, others do not agree with them … No person or organisation should be forced to be involved in or to approve of **mixed-race** marriages.

There are biblical passages that can be used to justify disapproval of mixed race relationships. Really, I'm not joking. Does **anyone** use those passages in the UK and get taken seriously? Fuck no.

My fear would be if one company (or several companies of like minds) should buy up all of the land or sea they then have a monopoly.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"&gt;provides quite a substantial amount of the money floating around
  
i'm honestly baffled by how you intend this, what with so many crazy ideas about how economies work floating around - my first assumption would be that you're suggesting a trickle down effect? my second that you're a a value-creationist and the third you're coming from an traditionalist productionist economic model and quiet, quiet mad.  
  
The money goes in two directions but the main flow is thus;
  
Lowest User &gt; lowest dealer &gt; mid dealer &gt; local capo &gt; smugglers &gt; growers.  
  
Often everyone from the lowest dealer to the suppler is connected to an international syndicate such as the Cosa Nostra, Triad Society or Russian Mafia.  Each user tends to work at a regular job, certainly in the case of cannabis, they'll then pay between £25 and £200 a week to their dealer who'll likely pay around £170 making £40 profit.  The mid dealer will buy kilo's at a time making hundreds of pounds profit per sale, the capo will have an arrangement to buy tons from the smuggler thus making thousands per sale while the smuggler will often be making hundreds of thousands of pounds of profit every consignment.  (the local growers make much more than possible with any other crop but rarely earn big money).
  
So the lowest users are handing stacks of ready money to the mid dealers, who hand most of it to the capo - this means that mid dealers tend to have a bit of extra wedge in their pocket to spend at the pub, paying for things with cash shouldn't rouse suspicion unless they go way over the top, in the true economy a portion of their money is being spent on consumer items in exactly the same way as if it'd been them that spent it, in this regard a portion of cannabis sales is effectively transparent to the economy.  
  
The capo however isn't living an average life downing a dozen in the duck before a kebab - his established criminal empire is already providing him an affluent lifestyle and often these things exist exactly because they're money laundering exercises or the excess from a scam.  Not only does the capo have little need for the disposable items petty cash buys but he's also got to be really careful with his book keeping because teams of forensic accountants are likely spying on his every activity.   This is why huge stacks of drug money are VITAL to his operation, rather than having to withdraw money from his account, pretend to spend it, change the notes to unrecorded ones and et cetera; a capo with a drug empire can just peel a few of the totally untraceable notes from his stack.  This means when he needs some guns that aren't linked to him, to pay some bribe or corrupt some official it's instantly do able.  
  
In this regard a portion of all users money is being diverted into the black market economy, this brings with it the obvious increase in power and attraction black market dealing has.  
  
Now consider how it could be in a green market model, 
  
Lowest user &gt; Hobby Grower &gt; Garden Centre  
  
The lowest users would still work and pay a sum of money for their weed to a friend or contact, this guy instead of knowing a mafioso keycutter will simply have an area of space dedicated to growing cannabis - he'll probably charge less than is charged now but likely make the same sort of profit a mid dealer does now; if he charges £60 an o he'll be making a tenner more than as a middleman and the user will be saving £140 - this is the money which would have otherwise gone into the black market.  
  
The local garden supply store will see an increase in sales and interest, most people would likely grow a few plants themselves but buy the majority of their weed from a more dedicated grower; the boom in garden products will help revive a vital industry during this time of economic hardship, especially as all these people with a new interest in horticulture will have a bit of extra wedge in their backburner...  
  
So rather than the people who want to stuff brown envelopes with used fifties or buy black market firearms the money will be going to people who want to buy new hydroponic systems and heated cultivators.  
  
And lets take a second to consider than, hydroponics and et cetera is a massively ignored industry in the main stream - high density food production however is one of the most pressing issues of the twenty-first century; unless more money is spend on automated and highly effective grow solutions we're very soon going to reach the point where by we simply don't have enough space to grow the food we want and we won't be able to afford to buy it off anyone any more.  I would certainly rather see a booming home agriculture industry than a booming blackmarket!  
  
I come from an estate with a LOT of weed smokers, my toker friends span the spectrum of ages, intelligence and interests however only the ones with an aptitude for criminality are rewarded by the weed system as it stands; the people who hang with naughty criminals and love the thrill of going to load the car with 3k of chronic.  My friends that like growing either got caught (a grow op is far more risky than a split and sell) or have to content themselves with pot plants and veg patches; certainly i can think of ten people i know who'd be skilled gardeners by now if pot plants weren't banned.  I'm not saying we'll be able to change every street corner pusher into a flower arranger, i am saying that diminishing the power criminals have to carry out their plans while increasing the ability gardeners have to implement theirs is surely a good idea.
  
And remember it's not just drug users that will benefit from this green economy model, the growers may well be middle aged mums or retired old men; if it was legal and accepted there's no reason what so ever that the sort of person who just loves plants couldn't grow some nice weed in their garden, even my nan says she'd grow it if it was legal just because it's such a beautiful plant!  Rather than making life ever harder for working class people to survive why not open up a simple cash crop which could allow them to earn enough pocket change to treat themselves to a meal out every few months or a trip to the cinema.  Again, money which today buys a capo's minion an illegal handgun could instead be buying the old ww2 vet who sells tomato's and runner beans outside his house a new box set of World At War Remastered.  
  
I'm not pretending it'll always work like this or that this solution will be a wide reaching effect - it will however make a difference in the right directions.  
  
Even the corporatist model works better;

Arsenal haven't really made any impact signings and may lose quality if Cesc leaves. 

Liverpool have added a lot of depth but legitimate impact players, I don't think so. Their quality will be higher than that of recent seasons but I think Suarez is the only real threat. Gerrard is injured too often, Carrol is good but we can counter with Drogba. Downing is not that worrisome - Cole or Ivanovic will deal with him.

United have gotten a bit better with Ashley Young but again, their wingers were already good so they're not adding too much. They should be worried that they haven't retooled their midfield.

City have added Aguero who can be great, but we're a very physical team with a suffocating defense so he can be cancelled out. Just don't give up a free kick to him.

I don't think any other team has made major signings we need to worry about. If Torres can find his form, he'll be our impact signing. He's a sleeping dragon right now, I hope he can wake up during the season.

Rose: I found her... boring, I never saw her getting major personality changes, since the moment she joined Nine and all that time with Ten she always seemed the same, of course she came back all ""bad ass"" from that other dimension but that really didn't seem to last. It's not that I didn't like her relationship with Ten but I found uninteresting and even sometimes as a drag to the show.

Micky/Ricky: He was like a filler companion to me but with all that other dimension arc he ""took a level in bad ass"" and was a bit more interesting has a character.

Martha: When she started travelling with Ten I was really excited to see where will they take this character but has OP said they made her a ""rebound companion"" me: &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Donna: So far my favorite companion (aside from Rory of course) She wasn't interested in the Doctor romantically, she wanted to be his friend and go out to the universe and have adventures since she was bored from her life. Of course she started like an annoying, bitchy character but she started growing out of that and turned into a great friend to Ten when he need it the most

Amy: Sometimes I found her clever, witty and brilliant... and sometimes I found her annoying bitchy and all around I want to punch her in the face so she stops annoying Eleven and/or Rory so yeah, it depends on the chapter

Rory: At first I was like: great another Micky *rolls eyes* but then he started to get more presence in the show and while he was afraid most of time (I mean seriously who will act all brave against the things Rory has seen) He also showed bravery and loyalty towards the protection of Amy that it became what he is currently, someone who can actually speaks in equal terms to the Doctor [having the memories of 2000 years of guarding the pandorica and such.](/spoiler)

true,[deleted],null,null,"Here's my personal take on it:

* **Rose** She's my favorite. I started watching very early in 2005, so she was my first companion. I think I fell in love with the show, and by extension her and the 9th doctor. I think her story arc was the best, and she had the most impact on the series. She also had the best ending. 

* **Mickey/Ricky/etc** I couldn't stand him. They tried to play him off as the somewhat insecure boyfriend that was paranoid at first, but with good reason. I just did not relate to the character. He was whiny most of the time, and summed it up best: ""I'm the tin dog!""

* **Martha** I liked Martha, but I think I liked her more after she was no longer a companion. There just wasn't much for her character to do, and she wasn't there long enough to really explore it. She's similar to the 9th Doctor, a lot of potential that we didn't get a chance to see. 

* **Donna** An unpopular opinion, but I did not like Donna at all. She was loud and obnoxious. She was in a lot of good stories, but I just couldn't get onboard with her attitude and personality. IMO they tried to play her off as the ""street smart"" companion against the brilliant Doctor, but to me she came off as just dumb. I'll admit her ending was brilliant and tragic at once. 

* **Amy** I like her, and I'm glad she didn't end up with another crush on the Dr. Her being married to Rory gives the show something new ( to me). I also do like the flirty dynamic between her and 11th Dr, keeps things interesting. 

* **Rory** When I first saw him, I thought to myself, ""great its Tin Dog 2.0"". But he's really grown in as a good character. He's the ""good man"", who would do anything for Amy. He doesn't have much power, but he'll do whatever it takes. I like how this is contrasted with the Dr, who is more unpredictable, has the ability to do anything, but you're not quite sure what he's thinking. I also like that they gave him a heroic side with the Centurion persona. He's quickly becoming one of my favorite characters.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is my answer, from another thread, as to why I hate Rose.

&gt;I loathe her because of how badly her character progressed in season 2-4. In season one she saved the day, and did a pretty cool job of it. In season 2 she ended up just being a ball and chain that the Doctor carried around with him, save for a few memorable moments where she was more.

&gt;Not only that her character diminished both Martha and later Donna. For Martha the entire first half of season 3 was her trying to get the Doctors attention, but never stacking up to Rose (which if you were to compare them is really pretty sad) in his eyes.

&gt;Then Donna, my favorite companion for 10, gets royally fucked by Rose. The end of season 4 should have been about Donna, Donna becoming part timelord and saving the day, and Donna loosing all of her memory, essentially dying for us. Yet I felt that her moment was diminished by Rose and her attitude through out, and the second Doctor which was pretty much created so Rose could have a toy in the other universe. So when Donna was lost to us, it seemed much more like a footnote at the end of the season, rather than a grand goodbye which is what Rose got.

&gt;So I guess, if you want to sum it up, I hate Rose because her character far outlived her welcome for me. I would have been fine to see her go in season 2, hell when I watched it for the first time I was sad. Yet after that she kept coming back, became as important as the Doctor in many ways. Even though her character is a selfish, childish, bitch.

Lastly, and one a completely unrelated note: You can travel through all of time and space, you have a ship that is bigger on the inside and has a very well stocked wardrobe. Yet, despite all these things, you continue to wear a trashy track suit and never bother to dye your eyebrows blonde?

true,jayratch,null,null,"Ahh the companions.  You're missing out somewhat by not having seen the old series.  There's a lot of fun characters to be had back there.  

Rose to me is like the 9th doctor: she seemed great at the time, but now that I and the franchise have moved on, it's hard to see why I liked her so much.  The best thing about her was the ""sleeper"" aspect: she was kind of a stealth badass.  She's tough as nails and you might not notice or expect it at first.  She's also great at properly representing the working class.  

I never liked Mickey.  I can sympathize with his plight, but I never liked him for a day.

Martha rocks.  Shame that she ends up with Mickey.  She deserved better.  If she was a rebound for the Doctor, Mickey was definitely a rebound for her.  

Donna was one of the guys.  But I actually kind of hate that about her, because it so nicely dovetails with my life experience of ""that type"" of woman.  Why does she have to be asexual?  I actually would have liked to see her develop a non-parasitic love interest, and it would be fun to revisit that in a future episode.  

Amy is awesome.  She is my favorite companion so far, past or future.  Her sexual tension with the Doctor is more nuanced than I can ever remember seeing with anyone else, and the love story between her and Rory is actually touching.  Also, what a twist to suddenly discover that you've been hanging out with your mother in law this entire time!  How awkwardly *team Edward.*  

Rory beats out Micky in every way.  Yes, there is a parallel there.  Perhaps it's intentional.  But I think they did it much better this time.  First, Rory didn't have the same ""bad attitude"" that Micky did at first.  His jealousy was a bit more muted.  The Doctor also treated him with a bit more respect, if I recall correctly which I might not.  More of Rory's personal growth was on-camera, so we actually did get to see the character develop unlike Micky who just suddenly reappeared one day as a full-fledged badass having only ever been a chav.  Rory as the Doctor's father-in-law has a strange commonality with his elder, in that both enjoy confusing relationships with their time-traveler  badass wives, being time-traveler badasses themselves.  And they have this strange degrees-of-separation thing, where they are really bonded by their loves of Amy and Melody/River much more so than by traditional friendship.  I think we have only started to see the relationship between the Doctor and Rory start to develop, and he will definitely be the companion to watch for.  

Which leaves only River, neglecting the one-offs.  River is awesome, but it may take us a while to really reach the level of character development that we have with Amy and Rory.  We shall see.

I understand, she went from small, quiet life to grand adventures and it was new and exciting, but I failed to see any justification for her falling in love with the Doctor. And then, as [EggfordFord notes](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/j9z40/why_do_people_hate_rose_what_do_you_think_of_the/c2ad06e), they went and defined Ten, Martha, *and* Donna around this precedent--that the Doctor was some amazing wooer of women.

Micky was just whiny, and he and Rose played the same note over and over: ""Come back."" ""No, it's so amazing."" ""What do you think of your precious Doctor now?"" Like everyone notes, he takes a level in badass, but that just raises my opinion to ambivalent. (And [ending up with Martha](/spoiler)? That seemed like a bit of an ass pull.)

I actually *really* liked Martha. Where Rose seemed to always be getting herself into trouble by doing *exactly what the Doctor told her not to do,* Martha didn't seem that way to me. She was damn clever, which made her fun to watch, not to mention very independent. I also thought her crush on the Doctor was a little unprecedented, but I thought she handled it a lot better than Rose.

I didn't like Donna that much when I was watching the series, but now that I've read discussions of how her character grew when she was with the Doctor, I'm inclined to agree. She tended to be loud and kinda hammy, but she was definitely an interesting character.

Amy is stellar. I love how bold, adventurous, and utterly Scottish she is. She's witty. And while some people might consider her too sexual, I actually think it's an interesting change.

That's the point.  The companion has always, throughout the history of the show, been the ""down to earth"" character that we can relate to.  The producers/writers made a creative decision at the very beginning that British viewers would prefer to see a show that had a few characters who were normal, contemporary people ""just like them.""  Of course, the companions haven't always been contemporary- Leela and the highlander come to mind- but right down to that one insufferable flight attendant, the companions have generally been put there so that British (and incidentally American) viewers could relate.  

It's good that Chavs have had their chance to be represented on Who.  I don't think that I would ever be friends with Rose and Micky in real life, but I (as an American) actually feel that my cultural learnings of England (for make benefit glorious nation Amerika!) have improved as a result of their inclusion.

I've got tickets for 3 films on saturday: Wicker Tree, Panic Button and the Woman. Perhaps I'll see more but it depends on my companion. I'll be in the back (JJ/KK) with the one-film ticket peasants, wearing an Evil Dead t-shirt (if I can find it, that is). 5 days, Jesus Christ, you have to be at least a little crazy for that. I'd like to some day, let me know afterwards if it was a good idea. If you survive, that is.

I'm guessing Wicker Tree will be a festival highlight. Some part of me is hoping Christopher Lee will show up but he's probably filming the Hobbit now? Anyway I'd kill to be in the same theatre with him. Panic Button looks promising, and the Woman very controversial indeed. But hey, it can't be worse than Martyrs, right? 

I'm with you for most of your analysis. Don't be afraid of the Dark, however, looks like a piece of shit if you ask me, based on the trailer. I've proclaimed this opinion on reddit and have been downvoted to hell/largely ignored. I'll wait for the dvd.
Tucker &amp; Dale I've seen, it's buckets of awesome. Great festival movie. Troll Hunter I almost saw at the Brussels fantastic film festival in april but I missed it, it gets great reviews though and Norway is on a roll after Cold Prey/Fritt Vilt and Dark Woods/Vildmark. Fright Night trailer looks great but might be taking the tongue-in-cheek original too seriously. I'll definitely see it when it comes out though. Saint got none-too-stellar reviews in the Netherlands, but the director's Amsterdamned was great so it won't be a disaster and probably loads of fun, especially with a festival crowd.
A Lonely Place to Die jumps out from the other titles for me as well, I'm very curious. If at all possible I'll be attending this one as well. 

Have fun, and lots of respect for your 5-day adventure!

Dear OP, get the fuck over yourself, its a scratch, either give the little shits less valuable bday/xmas presents or force them to pay it off in chores. Maybe afterwards you can even use your clearly undriveable [*read 'scratched'] car to take them home?

Be that man if you want to, lordatomosk. Sorry, I'm just trying to be supportive. You seem to have an active imagination and the passion. Maybe you've got the talent too.

If you want to check out the format, RTD packaged several scripts into compilations and you can still get them in Hardback on Amazon. I've gone one that has 2 Moffat shooting scripts in it I think. It at least has the empty child. I really want Girl in the Fireplace, Blink, and Midnight, but never went looking for them. The book is great though and cheap. It's like a hardcover text book with like 5 scripts on glossy pages with some photos in it. I think mine was like 10-15 dollars.

Micky: Always came off as whiny and desperate to get Rose back from the Doctor, that got old pretty quick. He sort of redeemed himself when he began to help out with things.

Martha: She was smart, knew what she was doing most of the time but always tried to tell the Doctor to do what was right, and kind of controlled 10 a bit. 

Captain Jack: I realize this isn't going to be a popular opinion but he came off as a douche and stayed that way only until after the defense of the  satellite and 9's regeneration, then he kind of grew on me I guess.

Donna: As another Redditor pointed out, loud and obnoxious, didn't really care for her, or the 4th season.

Amy: She's been pretty okay so far,  I'm glad the whole romance thing didn't go through with her and the Doctor though. She's a bit more sexualized than Rose was, but still manages to keep that ""Sweet Girl"" that's fascinated by the adventures of the Doctor.

Rory: He complains a lot, but not as much as Mickey did. He finally decides to accept the strange situation he's in and mans the fuck up after awhile.

She once went on a rant about the government to me, and while I just replied with ""yeah""s and ""hmm""s, she called me an ungrateful whore at one point, which was a tad out of the blue to say the least.

The last time I saw her was about a month ago, I was with my sister (who had no idea who zimmer was prior to this), and zimmer was actually being fairly civil - to us, anyway. She chatted about nothing in particular to us, 'til a middle aged woman stood close to us laughed at something her husband said and zimmer started calling her a 'fucking slag', and saying 'my mother had more class than that cunt ever will' (which makes no sense in the slightest because zimmer herself was at least 20 years older than the woman). She then started 'flirting' with a man who recognised her, until she *finally* got off (at Old Roan too, she usually gets off at Orrell Park but decided to inflict herself on us for two extra stops I guess).

When she got off my sister looked a bit shell-shocked so the man who had been talking to zimmer started telling us more stories about her - apparently she's banned from every taxi rank in Liverpool for telling taxi drivers they want to fuck her, or saying she'll 'get in the front and suck them off', and more of the same which is just as disturbing.

true,QuirkyGroundhog,null,null,"Well yeah, sure, but the majority of Davies' episodes weren't character heavy stuff either, he mostly wrote the 'plot' eps, like Moffat. And Davies also wrote more episodes per each of his seasons then Moffat does (he seems to write premier, finale, and middle). For instance:

Season 3 Davies:

Runaway Bride (Plot episode)
Smith and Jones 
Gridlock (Arguably a plot episode, but I wouldn't count it)
Utopia (Plot episode)
The Sound of Drums (Plot episode)
Last of the Time Lords (Plot episode)

Season 4 Davies: 

Voyage of the Damned 
Partners in Crime (Arguably Plot Episode)
Midnight 
Turn Left (Plot Episode)
The Stolen Earth (Plot Episode)
Journey's End (Plot Episode)

So there really isn't that big of a difference. Moffat and Davies both mostly wrote the plot centric episodes. Now, yeah, Moffat has less room for little divergences from the main plot then Davies did, but it's not like Curtis went rogue and wrote the Van Gogh ep, Moffat would have known what was going there and, as per most showrunners, probably had a hand in it. Who personally wrote the episode doesn't really matter, though even if it did; most of Davies' eps were also the plot centric ones, so the point is moot. 

And hey, Moffat gave us Blink and the Girl in the Fireplace, both of which I'd describe as pretty darned character heavy. It's just that the over all pace of Moffat's seasons allow less quirky divergences, but he seems to try to include a couple per season.

true,herofix,scottish,The Garioch,"I don't think you say to a journalist 'you can tap this guy's phone'.  

Let's be clear.  We're talking about the way the law works in practice right now, right?  Because, as I understand it, there *is* currently a public interest defence for law-breaking with regards to journalists breaking stories. [This is the take of former director of prosecutions Sir Ken McDonald on how it works.](http://blogs.journalism.co.uk/editors/2010/10/06/we-do-want-journalists-to-break-the-rules-says-former-prosecutions-chief/)

Why does the law tolerate what is basically a grey and ambiguous area for journalism?  Because the ability for journalism to hold the powerful to account is so important in a free country.

I understand your respect for the rule of law.  But there is no reason that a law can't be refined so that throwing a brick at someone's head is usually forbidden, but in some cases acknowledged as necessary to prevent a worse incident.  And that's how it works now.  Judges, police officers and prosecutors use discretion in these areas, or the exception can be written into the law itself.

I acknowledge your examples about possible unpleasant consequences to having this exception in place.  But there are very real situations in the world to make a counter-argument to it.  If you take any authoritarian regime you care to mention, which sees its own grip on power as its primary concern, any and all efforts at changing that regime are made illegal, always including the ability to talk about their crimes and share that information with other people.  If we make law-abiding in itself to be the highest moral good, we're missing the point of laws.  Laws are a means to an end, and the end is principles we're committed to; say for example, 'liberty, justice and equality' or things like that.  If the interests of those principles are better served on occasion by breaking those laws, it's not a moral wrong to break them, and is in fact in the interest of the public.  So in answer to your question about where my priorities lie, the answer is 'with a free press, to act as a check on authority'.

Disney plays off this as well, but they make it ok, by substituting talking animals, and finding a husband by the end of the film, thus fulfilling the female hero-quest to assume the motherly role.

But in Horror, it goes unresolved and is unsettling, which is why Amy, someone who is clearly going to be a great mom, had her baby stolen ""Fair-folk"" style, that is to say, switched with a fake.

I look at Moffat asking Curtis to write an episode the exact same way I look at RTD giving Moffat episodes during his run. I love them both to pieces. These are just the fundamental differences in my mind. RTD was more about humanity and relationships, and Moffat is more into the adventure of the Doctor Who cannon. Moffat is more epic (in the true sense of the word) and thorough in details relevant to the story. 

I also think it's ironic that one of the most expressive episodes about the Doctor during RTD's years was The Girl in the Fireplace, written by Moffat. I wish he'd do some of that now, but that may have been compliance with RTD's direction.

Probably not very practical in the scheme of things, but I liked her better as a kid. And I certainly don't think she's mature enough to be married or have a baby. So don't know how that one's going to work.

Rose wasn't my favorite companion, but I don't understand all the hate for her either. She was young, which is probably her biggest fault. I think she was played like a late teen would actually behave in real life. She was selfish and bratty at times, but she genuinely cared about other people. We see it at the beginning of season one and we see it throughout. She had her hang-ups and I feel like the way she treated Mickey was really shitty. But she was so so young. And I think Billie Piper did an excellent job portraying the fact that she was still immature and she was *human.* 

The entire universe presented to her and few things seemed as important as meeting her father. I think that's a big theme throughout all the seasons, really. We're biased because we see the world through the Doctor's eyes. We know how amazing everything is, and how stupid someone is for not appreciating how incredible that is, but we rarely ever give Rose credit for the fact that she took an enormous leap of sanity when she jumped into the Tardis in the first episode.

true,nerdyraver,null,null,"Companions are always a controversial subject. My views are:

Rose: I really liked Rose and Nine.  Mainly because Nine was so bitter and angry and Rose had a huge impact on him. Plus she destroyed the Dalek fleet and had general moments of awesome mixed with naive charm.  With Ten, I didn't like her.  The relationship didn't flow as smoothly and it was disappointing to not see Rose be as strong as she was with Nine.

Micky: I always rooted for Micky because he was just the normal guy caught up in everything.  He just wanted to be there for Rose, and I think her treatment of him was awful.  I liked him because he was an everyday guy, but in the parallel universe, you see how genuinely good he is.  He leaves his entire life behind to start again.  He really became an awesome character in the end and I'm glad his story ended happily. 

Martha: I loved Martha because she was an intelligent companion who could function aside from the Doctor.  She was a medical student, trying to hold her family together and in most of her adventures with the Doctor, she holds her own.  Especially with the Family episodes and the Last of the Time Lords, she runs around and saves the world completely on her own.  She also has the best career after SHE leaves the Doctor (which I think was very brave of her).

Donna: She grew on me. At first her over the top actions and loud voice annoyed me so much, but I really liked the relationship between her and the Doctor (just being mates). I found her ending so disappointing and I will admit that I cried when she stared at him and said ""But I was going to be with you forever"". She was the only companion I was sad to see go.

Amy: I really don't like Amy.  Mainly due to her treatment of Rory and possessiveness of the Doctor.  She isn't all that bright and her being sassy all the time really irritates me.  The only time I feel anything other than irritation towards her, is when she cries or is upset about Rory. I hate that the writers keep making us doubt Amy's love for Rory and keep throwing her love for the Doctor in there.

Rory: I love Rory.  By far my favourite.  He is so loyal and just takes everything is stride. His unwavering love for Amy is incredible and his role as the Last Centurion is perfect.  I feel every emotion he does because he portrays them all realistically.

Last year The Guardian talked about it as being the coolest,
http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/may/19/brighton-britains-coolest-city

""is there anything particularly interesting there?""
Oh my... Where to start?

The city has a long history (modern period from the 18th Century) of arts and cultural events. You should definitely read up on the history, and visit the Pavilion,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Pavilion

We have a great month-long festival period each year,
http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/

There's a fabulous gay community, which is a great asset as it scares off the chavs. They also know how to throw a party,
http://www.brightonpride.org/

The other big subcultures include anarchists and hippies,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowley_Club

A really cool, jazzy French radio station is even rebroadcast here, initially as a pirate station,

Some other listings here,

If you're not interested in the same old mainstream club and pub culture that every city has, then I'd recommend avoiding West Street, and on Friday and Saturday nights the central beach front.
The good news is that there are plenty of other places to go.

As far as Sussex uni goes, it's a lovely campus outside the city, nestled at the foot of the rural South Downs,

She's citing an Old Testament book, Deuteronomy, that says neither sex should wear clothes intended for the other. Leaving alone the fact that trousers weren't around when the bloody book was written, Deuteronomy also includes gems such as:

* Killing a *victim* of rape - Deut 22:23-24 
* Rape &amp; murder of women and children if they don't surrender to your army - Deut 20:10-14
* Kill people who don't listen to priests - Deut 17:12
* Stone girls to death if they're found not to be virgins - Deut 22:20-21

I don't want to turn this into a ""Find the worst shit in the bible"" competition, but you get the idea. This lady has decided that one particular aspect of the book is oh-so-important to her sensibilities and is suing the NHS because of their carefully considered hygiene regulations.

She didn't seem to care what happened to anyone else, so long as the Doctor got to her and paid attention to her. If he didn't, she threw a tantrum. 

Micky/Ricky got better once Rose wasn't baby-ing him. For example, he grew up a lot when he met Martha, and seemed very different in the scene at the end of The End Of Time. 

Martha was less clingy, but still had an awkward rebound love interest thing going on. Again, she was better after Donna was introduced. A big plus for her over Rose is that she did have the ability to work on her own. Especially during the disaster with the Master. 

Donna was less of a love interest, mainly because she didn't fall for him, and she was older. Donna came off as more of a best friend. She had a temper, and wasn't a gun-ho warrior, but she worked well with the doctor as a traveling friend.

Amy was an interesting change, as she was the first one with a steady/ strong romantic relationship outside of the doctor. Her travels with the Doctor came off more as a friend, with a little flirting on the side, and less as an attempt to get into his pants. The interplay with River made this even more interesting. 

Rory was similar to Micky/Ricky, but had a stronger personality from the beginning. He was worried some about the relationship between Amy and the Doctor, but wasn't annoying about it. In season 6, he gains an even stronger personality, especially [with River Song/Melody Pond missing. He's taken on a strong Father personality.](/spoiler) 

Truthfully, River Song is still my favorite. Although she hasn't been a consistent companion yet, she still has the most honest byplay with the Doctor. This may be because they have an established history on her side, and/or because she seems to be older than all of the others. The play between her and Amy and Rory also adds an interesting spice.

Rose - She was my first and brought me into Doctor who so I love her, her warmth, empathy and care for all things. Dalek is one of favourite episodes or the character development and that it shows that Roses true character and the doctors darker side. Admittedly te love thing was a little overdone in series 2
Mickey - I always liked him, thought he was funny and genuine character. Of course when he went from zero to hero I was even more... proud of him I suppose, seeing him take on the world and move on
Captain Jack - The man is made of pure awesome. What more can I say. 
Martha - I loved Martha because she was clever and independent, but trusted the doctor with her life. I always felt they shouldve given her more time but I love Donna as well so...
Donna - She is one of my favourite companions because of the development. Her pure lovingness for everything (planet of the ood comes to mind) pared with a brilliant sense of humour and her mutual relationship with the doctor was a breath of fresh air as romantic relations with companions was all I knew. 
Wilf - No one else has included him but I thought he deserved o be here. I loved the character, acting and relationship with the doctor, Wilf had. The almost pleading way when Donna was left ( :'( ) 'she was better with you' makes me cry every time! His part in ----- the special can't remember what it wa called was amazing and the scene with the gun also made me tear up. 
Amy - I love Amy but only after, ' the vampires of Venice' when she seams to accept that she gets Rory which any girl should be happy with, although every time I see Amy I always think there is so much more to be done with the character. I hope they give her a proper ending, not like donna. 
Rory - hands down my favourite companion (at least at the moment) the way he has lived in this mans shadow for years (Amy made Rory dress up as him even when they were kids!) even after he mustve heard him being talked about with the highest praise he still stands up for what he believes in. Also his pure love for Amy is amazing and the whole last centurion story should be discussed so much more, about what happened though. Also the pure baddassery is something i look forward to in the new series. 
River - When river was first introduced I was not sure about her. The story was brilliant but her character was a bit know it ally, for my liking. When she cane back in the time of the Angels, I loved her, really loved her. The character and banter with the doctor is fun also the flirting I find hilarious and just perfect. I need to know more about her though so I cannot wait for august 27th. 

I have been needing to write that for a long time...

I supposed that because he is their Uncle they should be allowed to destroy anything of his that they want and not be held responsible because ""they are children and know not the ramifications of what they do"" It is people like you and your attitude towards other peoples lives and property that make this such a difficult world to live in.

The first time around that didn't bother me so much because when you're starting out learning the Whoniverse it's easy to identify with Rose (she doesn't have the strongest personality, kind of like Harry Potter). But when I rewatch, it frustrates me that I'm supposed to ignore her continuing mistreatment of Mickey. I think most of the dislike of Rose comes from the fact that she really is just a typical shopgirl, who somehow becomes the Doctor's true love. But if you ask me, that' way more forgivable than stringing your boyfriend along for over a year with no intention of ever going back to him.

And personally? I liked Rose better with Nine than with Ten.

When we have Crouch on the pitch, we do tend to cross the ball from midfield and hope that he can receive it because of his height, instead of trying to build up a passing/running play and try to get a dangerous sideline cross/pass in instead.

Not to mention Crouch's poor performance in the first leg versus Real Madrid... I mean, he didn't do any good interception at all, he totally deserved that red card. On the bright side though, he did score versus Milan - but after Lennon (brilliantly) set him up for the goal.

The problem is that with Roman on the pitch he tends to be a little bit selfish, at least he was during the first half (before he was substituted ahead of the second) against Orlando Pirates just recently in South Africa. He would receive the ball from midfield, and try his luck way out of the box, instead of trying to build up a play.

But, as a final note, I'll say that having Roman on the pitch blowing some good chances is probably better than having Crouch on the pitch if it changes our way of play (into playing 90% cross balls from our half).",0,1312594013,null,0,false,0,c2agx1v,t3_j9c0o,t1_c2agx1v,t1_c2abc7a,1427437083,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Martha was better, but RTD should never have made her the second unrequited lovestruck teen girl who's too inexperienced compared to the Doctor.

Donna I loved because she was the Doctors friend. He didn't need humans falling head over heels for him, just a buddy. And Amy and Rory are great. Rory is the boyfriend who isn't jealous just worried, and now he's got a personality!

Amy is fantastic too. She has a unique sort of sister-brother relationship with the Doctor. And while she's flirty and sassy she's not actually serious about falling in love with the Doctor. So Moffat handled the Doctor crush thing well. And even when Amy was crushing on the Doctor it wasn't some sort of teen drama/angst thing.

true,Matriss,tardis,TARDIS,"I dislike Martha, but I think a lot of that is that I found Season 3 to be rather weak overall.  Sure, it has Blink and some other great ones, but a lot of it was stupid IMO.  I didn't like how she constantly pined over the Doctor and acted personally offended whenever the Doctor was sad about Rose or, really, anything else.  Especially when the Doctor tells Jack offhandedly that Rose isn't dead and she bitches about it.  I'm sorry, whether the mention of someone makes you uncomfortable or not, you can shut your mouth when someone is *reassuring a friend that a mutual friend of theirs isn't dead.*

Yes, she technically kicked a lot of ass in the season finale, but it was *informed* ass-kicking (telling and not showing is the death of a good story).  While I understand *why* it was done like that, it didn't really build up the ""Martha is a badass"" image they were going for.  Even though we didn't directly see Rory's years guarding the Pandorica, the way the camera slowly pans over ""history of the Pandorica"" does a lot to underline exactly *how long* he spent as the Last Centurion.  You know how you look at timelines in museums and things and just go, ""Wait, this thing is *how* old?  Fuuuuuck!""?  Moffat used that to provoke a reaction in us, cleverly skirting the ""show don't tell"" rule.

However, having some random guy we've never seen before fangirl over Martha for five minutes in order to try to sum up the last year didn't quite have the same impact.

You make a great point about the lack of storytelling in the season 3 finale.  That finale could have been great, but it was really a mess in several ways.

Perhaps I was alright with Martha's behavior toward the Doctor because I found that he was sending her mixed signals.  She was, essentially, the rebound companion.  I think this is why they wrote a companion so very unlike Rose.  And that sucked for her.  The amazing Doctor invites her on exciting adventures, and he can't shut up about the last girl he was with.  I'm sure we've all been there.

Anyhoo, it never used to be a pet peeve of fans; if people are referring to the lead character in general conversation calling him ""Doctor Who"" is easier than calling him ""The Doctor, from Doctor Who"". Anyway, he's clearly the one being referred to in the name of the series, so if a non-fan called him Doctor Who, it's a natural thing to do. Oh, and a TRUE fan knows that WOTAN called him Doctor Who in The War Machines.

With Mickey, people instantly hated him because of how he ran away scared in the first ep. To me, that was a hell of a lot more normal reaction to a strange man with a magic disappearing box showing up in your life than Rose's was. He was very human and always had an inferiority complex because, let's face it - the Doctor came and stole his girlfriend. I don't think most guys would be able to handle it as well as he did. 

The season with Martha I think suffered most from some seriously bad episodes (the episodes with the Daleks in depression-era New York? Ugh). The character itself I liked. She did much better, I think, in her appearances on Torchwood, where she was past her Doctor crush. Yeah, unfortunately, she kind of got 'rebound' treatment. 

Donna is hands-down my favorite. I think I fell in love with her in the Runaway Bride when she calls the Doctor 'skinny as a rat'. I liked that they made a female companion with absolutely no sexual interest in the Doctor and with an excess of sass and snark. She was mouthy.

Of all the new companions, Amy is probably my least favorite. Not to say that I don't like her, but to me she's the least interesting and most forgettable.

* Amy saved the world from Bracewell's bomb through her understanding of human nature, which was explicitly superior to the Doctor's in that instance
* She figured out how to stop the recording-Angel with no help from the Doctor or River
* She killed herself in order to be with Rory in the dream episode
* She thought of using areas not habitable by humans for the Silurians, which was the turning point in the compromise between the races
* She brought a light into Van Gogh's life when the Doctor was a little too focused on the church monster

Doctor: You know, Nik, I used to be a lot like you. A genius before his time, constantly looked over and unrecognized in the face of others, whose sole advantages were their social connections and ruthlessness. It's a miserable state, almost unbearable at times. [Doctor puts his hand on Tesla's shoulder, looking melancholy] 


Tesla: Indeed. How did you learn to cope with it? 


Doctor: [looking up, smiling] Cope? I didn't cope. Coping is for when you've been beaten. I stole a time machine and surrounded myself with people who *would* appreciate my genius. And look at me now! I travel across time and space and I have adventures! The best kinds of adventures, Nik! I go wherever and whenever I want with my friends. Sure, sometimes there are sad bits, and scary bits, and bits with little angry aliens who scream a lot, but they make the other bits so much better! The funny bits, the exciting bits, the bits where I send the angry screaming aliens running. Well, sliding, to be precise. [pause]. Look, what I'm trying to say is, when life gives you pears, you don't have to make do with pears. Throw away the pears and pick up a banana instead! 


Tesla: Lemons. 


Doctor: What? 


Tesla: The phrase is ""When life gives you lemons."" 


Doctor: Yeah, but I like lemons. 


Tesla: [blinking, kind of confused, but mostly understanding what the Doctor's trying to say] So, Doctor, do you suggest I should steal my own time machine and take my life into my own hands? 


Doctor: Well, if you can find one lying around, sure, why not. Worked for me. But I like that second part. Take control of your life, Nik! Don't waste it away trying to please people who will only steal your life's works and give you nothing in return. Believe me, I know what it's like to have everything you've ever known and loved ripped away from you.   


&gt;I imagine there being some point in the story where the Doctor is somehow incapacitated or otherwise detained, and Tesla has no other choice but to try piloting the TARDIS. And he does.

Yup I said returning and based on that I'll also offer some area advice...

Stockbridge seems to have been left off of the lists so far.  And it's awesome (I used to live there!).  It's like a little village within the city.  Areas like Gorgie, Dalry and Fountainbridge have a little bit of a mixed reputation.  Fountainbridge is currently being redeveloped and is set to be a pretty nice area in the next few years.  Other than that these areas tend to offer cheaper,central accommodation which attracts students, entry level graduates and the occasional scumbag.  The same applied to some of the south side areas like Newington. SiliconRain seems to have most of the info pretty much on the mark.

I'm a Glaswegian girl by birthright, but have lived in Edinburgh for several years and I love it.  It's a fantastic, beautiful city.

That's Labour legacy. Seems that the only thing they got right, economically, was staying out of the Euro - and that's only really thanks to Black Wednesday which cost us nothing compared to what bailing out other countries might have cost.

One only has to go back to 2009 (during the Labour government, with its profligacy and waste at full speed) with S&amp;P warning of a downgrade.

A couple of negative points to balance out my fanaticism,

A new football stadium has been created opposite the university. It's an ugly building, and on the weekend some fans come wandering through the university campus. Traffic on the road outside is heavy too. I'm at uni now, and I can hear them cheering the game, even when I'm inside with the window ajar.
As a postgrad you might appreciate working on campus at the weekend as it's normally a lot quieter than during the week. Having the football fans nearby does somewhat reduce the appeal as far as I'm concerned, especially if you like to lie out on the lawns, reading in the sunshine.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falmer_Stadium

In the last year or two there have been substantial cuts in faculty and resources at the uni. i.e., there are fewer lecturers now than before. Furthermore the uni is trying to increase student numbers significantly in order to increase revenue. This is likely to result in worse teacher:student ratios. Last year particularly there was a prolonged period of protests from students and staff.

So said Jonathan Aitken, then Conservative Chief Secretary to the Treasury, in response to an article published in the Guardian about [his secret role in negotiating deals with Saudi Arabia on behalf of various arms manufacturers](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1999/mar/05/uk.davidpallister). The investigation was run by David Leigh, the Guardian journalist referred to in this headline. Mr Aitken then sued the Guardian for libel, before having the case thrown out, and being himself convicted and sent to jail for perjury. That conviction relied on private hotel and flight records which the Guardian managed to obtain. In other words, that corruption at the heart of government would not have been uncovered without invading Aitken's personal privacy.

Carl Bernstein, half of the team that uncovered Watergate, has also [admitted using similar methods as part of his investigation](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/07/10/murdoch-s-watergate.html):

&gt; *""For this reporter, it is impossible not to consider these facts through the prism of Watergate. When Bob Woodward and I came up against difficult ethical questions, such as whether to approach grand jurors for information (which we did, and perhaps shouldn’t have), we sought executive editor Ben Bradlee’s counsel, and he in turn called in the company lawyers, who gave the go-ahead and outlined the legal issues in full. Publisher Katharine Graham was informed. Likewise, Bradlee was aware when I obtained private telephone and credit-card records of one of the Watergate figures.""*

The basic fact is that investigative journalism relies on legally dubious behaviour, because the cards are so heavily stacked against disclosure.

Investors try to make the best decision they can for risk/profit tradeoff. They have imperfect information and they handle it with imperfect reasoning. I would assume that patriotism plays a part, as do investors who preferentially lend money to the countries from whose growth they stand to benefit.

A final point is that a higher interest rate is not solely a result of a higher risk: it is also a cause of higher risk.

When they see something for the first time, he can see it, too. If he were alone, it wouldn't really register for him. Anyone who has lived abroad and showed visiting family/friends around what you have grown familiar with can get a glimmer of this feeling.

I get it, I really do. I really really do.

However, the reason behind my animosity was this... your car is not fucking RUINED!! The materialistic thinking behind people like you who think a scratch and a dent = 'ruined' is what pissed me off. I am currently living in a country where the vast majority of the population cannot afford a car, of the rest, most of them drive shit-beaten rusted scratched-to-fuck dented shitholes, and you know what? They are ok. Their 'ruined' car still works, it gets them to work, it drives them from A to B. They use their scratched and dented shitmobile to provide everything they can for their family. So you know what? As offensive as this may seem, I, personally, do not give a fuck if you count a scratch and a dent as a write-off. Your car is not fucking RUINED. Most of the people here would love to have your so-called 'ruined' car. I'm sorry, but a dent and a few scratches does not a ruin make, so get over your fucking self. So yeah, my previous gripe was nothing to do with parents making kids take responsibility, but everything to do with your firstworldproblem.

Also, I dont know where you are but the last time my car was seriously scratched I got it paint-matched and resprayed for just under £50 (Fife, Scotland), is a long-term feud with your family really worth £50? If not perhaps you should do what I said earlier if the parents refuse to make amends then just buy the little shits fuck all for Christmas, and when they ask why Uncle Dave didnt buy them anything just explain that it was because they know little about the repercussions of fucking up someone elses property, and if their own parents wont teach them it has been left to you instead - they'll hate you for it but never mind.

Lastly, Im sorry, but (and Im sorry if I jump to conclusions) the reason sometimes people dont want to pay for their brat's mess is because they know children. So I am assuming you have none? Because if you did have kids, you would know, they will eat soap, they will shit on the carpet, they will paint on the walls, they will slide down stairs in sleeping bags and ruin the wallpaper, they will piss n the wardrobe, they will eat raw sausages and go to hospital, they will say 'fuck' at strangers, they'll embarrass you in more ways that you can imagine. And I am very sorry to say, that after years of washing soap out mouths, cleaning shit from the carpet, washing paint from walls, re-papering the stairwell, bleaching the piss stained wardrobe, holding their hair back as they throw up uncooked meat, and apologising for the language, the least of a parents worries is your so-called ""ruined"" car. Dont get me wrong, if my kids fuck up in a big way I will pay, if my kids smash the neighbours windows I will pay the damage and they will learn a valuable lesson, but in the meantime, you may want to consider getting over that so clearly ""ruined beyond repair"" vehicle of yours and move on.",0,1312660187,null,0,false,0,c2alwm9,t3_j9ye7,t1_c2alwm9,t1_c2ak2w1,1427439490,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

When my niece  burst my front door, yeah I was annoyed, and yes I wanted money to fix it, and when I didn't get the money I was even more annoyed, what I didn't do was hold some long-term grudge. You know why? Because no matter what they do I love both my sister and my niece unconditionally, far more than money, and I always will. I've also had my own little shits ruin a family members property more than once, most of the time I have been able to pay to get it fixed, on one occasion I havent.

true,ColonelPanic2409,null,null,"Alright, here is a little plan for you. It's really just a tour of a few areas of Cardiff I consider to be either pleasant places to be or otherwise interesting to witness, not necessarily tourist attractions! When I am visiting a new place I try to see it with honest eyes rather than through the lens of the tourist attractions alone.

This tour assumes you are starting from Queen Street (the high street). The forecast is showing that the weather should be quite nice.

Hire a pair of the yellow and green 'OYBike' bicycles from the station on Queen St at the castle end. The cost is £5 each, either for the day or for the week - your choice. Go for a ride past the castle on your right. Take a right and you're in Bute park where you will find that it's quite pleasant to go for a ride along the riverside, as people row past and you pass sports teams playing on the fields. Bute park is quite large so you can really let go and pick up some speed if that's your thing, there are bridges to cross and it's generally a nice place to be. Come back out of Bute park the way you came in. Head down Westgate street, past the Millennium Stadium. Carry straight on until you reach the train station (central station). Park your bikes in the bike station outside the railway station. 

Walk down Saunders Rd. in front of the station and cross straight ahead onto Mill Lane. This is where all the trendies hang out. The new John Lewis is located here too and is architecturally quite interesting. Why not stop in this area for a drink or two. If you head away from John Lewis (passing a church on your left) and take the left fork when the pedestrianised area splits in two, you will reach the market on your left (past House of Fraser). Have a look around the Market, mainly fresh meat, fish, fruit &amp; veg but perhaps also some souvenirs for people back home (postcards or tea-towels or whatever). Head back to collect your bikes from the station and ride them back down Mill Lane, taking a right so that John Lewis is on your left. Cross under the bridge and then under a second bridge to the left. Take a right onto Lloyd-George Avenue and cycle all the way to the end. 

Congratulations, you are now in Cardiff Bay. This would be an excellent place to stop and have lunch. You can park your bikes at the station at the very end of Bute Street (opposite a branch of HSBC). There is a wide range of cuisines available to you from the many restaurants in this area and at varying prices. You will be able to feed yourselves on whatever budget there, even if you just buy sandwiches from the little Tesco and then eat them whilst looking over the bay. Enjoy a leisurely lunch. You could even go on a boat ride if you have the funds and the inclination. Head back to the bike station and then cycle along Bute Street. Notice that it is parallel to the very plush Lloyd-George Avenue with its blocks of expensive flats but that it is considerably rougher - and literally on ""the other side of the tracks""! The regeneration of Cardiff Bay (formerly Tiger Bay) was intended to bring wealth to this area, but it has somewhat annexed the people who live in the area of Bute Street where there are many poorer families. Continue on and you should arrive back at John Lewis.

Cycle along Bute Terrace with John Lewis on your left, then follow Adam Street round to the left. You need to cross this wide road (Newport Road, an arterial route through Cardiff) and then travel along it to your right until you meet City Road on your left. This is one of the main roads in the Roath area of Cardiff. Notice the ridiculously high proportion of take-aways along here. I hear the council have banned any more fast-food businesses from opening on city Road, even associating their presence with crime rates in the area! You will eventually meet Albany Road on your right, which is really the High-Street of Roath. It is noticeably less wealthy of course than the main high street, but you may be interested to cycle along here and simply absorb the environment. I think it is interesting to see the contrast in a place - and the contrast between Roath and Cardiff Bay is quite a large one. Continue along Albany Road, stopping to buy picnic supplies if you are peckish or fancy a drink, until you follow left onto Wellfield Road. Ahead of you is Roath Community Centre, where you will find, conveniently located, another bicycle station. Chill in Ninian Park for a while, perhaps you smoke or want to have a picnic or kick a ball around (I don't know you, you have to fill in the blanks!) and here is a nice place to do such a thing. 

When you are done here, cycle back down Albany Road and this time cross back over City Road onto Richmond Road. Follow it round until there is a road which slopes down under a railway bridge on your right. Take a left and you are on Salisbury Road, in the heart of Cathays, student land! This once-proud and beautiful district of Cardiff has been ravaged by the influx of students like me. At the last count I think there were 13,000 students living in Cathays. We are a blessing and a curse to Cardiff. As a student who lives in Cardiff full-time and continues to work part-time during the holidays, the economic difference when all the students go home is massive. Businesses on Salisbury Road really count on the student population. One such business is Noodlebox, an interesting, independent asian takeaway and restaurant. Ever-popular with students, if you didn't have that picnic in Ninian Park maybe you want to try a Noodlebox? Continuing past Noodlebox on your left, follow Salisbury Road round until you pass under another railway bridge, and carry on until you meet Park Place. Hopefully you know where you are by now! By the museum (which is free to enter, give it a go another day!). Turn left and go straight ahead, passing New Theatre on your right, and you're back on Queen Street, ready to return your bikes.

Whether or not you choose to follow any of my little tour, I hope you have a really nice time in Cardiff. It's a city I've grown to love since first coming here as a student two years ago. I had reservations about moving to Wales because it has a reputation for terrible weather and for seeming dull. It has completely won me over and I hope you like it too!",0,1312677782,null,0,true,0,c2anlh3,t3_jav6x,t1_c2anlh3,t3_jav6x,1427440286,10,false,southwales,t5_2rq3t,10

Jack used to be cool but now he's super homosexual jack with the ability to have sex with all the men. The plot is dull and pointless and uses hour long episodes to accomplish nothing. The overt religious tones in the previous seasons were fine but this season feels like we're being bashed over the head with it. 

Another problem I have are the one off tension issues. [Esther's sister and her kids being taken away. Esther cries about it for all of 20 minutes and then she's fine about it in the next episode. Rex and his mysterious hobo dad that he ""reconciles"" with. Didn't know about him before, did learn anything about him during, and was promptly forgotten afterward. Gwen's poor old dad suddenly having multiple pointless heart attacks. She goes to save him and then blam makes it worse. Next episode I be she won't even act like he went to the ovens at all. And Vera's laughable attempt at fixing the medical system only to realize she dislikes the fix. Jack's sudden ability to die and the consequently be poisoned on the plane to america reducing a whole episode to having gwen save him. After that they make a few references to it but really it has no major point in the plot so far.](/spoiler) They add nothing to the main plot and don't really make me care about the main characters at all.

Also, I'm not homophobic but how awkward can they make Jack. In the previous seasons he'd hit on guys or make out with them or they'd suggest he'd have some good ol roll in the hay. Nothing wrong with it. [But I don't need to see him having sex with some model dude while I watch Rex and Vera get it on. The two scenes could have occurred at different times in the episode instead of concurrently. Instead we get a weird mix of hetero/homo sex scenes that titillate no one except for maybe bi guys.](/spoiler)

I just got home - been there all night taking photo's.

Some messed up stuff.

JD Sports, Carphone Warehouse, PC World and the O2 shop were all completely gutted - people walking out with big screen TV's and shopping carts full of tech gear. Hundreds of thousands worth of stuff I'm sure. Must have been 75/100 people taking all sorts out of there.
Hardly any press there - I saw journalists being manhandled by the mob, a BBC news van drove away after people started throwing rocks at it. One guy pushed me around a bit because I had the camera. Pretty scary at points.

Carpet right set ablaze, completely gutted - Firemen said it's going to come down, it was half collapsed when I was walking back. Never seen a fire like that before.

Police cars &amp; riot vans blowing up.

Even the Tottenham FC ticket office got wrecked, all the glass broken. Pretty much every William Hill was wrecked.

Worst of all though were all the independent shops, some of them totally gutted - people's livelihoods ruined, at least for the next few weeks before they manage to clean up and put them back together. Saw a few people's cars just a burnt wreck on the road.

Is this totally ignoring the few simple facts of life like, low paid jobs have to exist in this system because that work NEEDS to be done - simply saying everyone below you is an idiot is ridiculous, the inescapable maths of the system will always have a vast amount of people on the bottom of the stack - that's how it works, until robots of course....  
  
Some people don't have access to the life style which helps them develop into your kind of person, parents too poor or ill-educated themselves to provide a role model yet alone the trappings of a liberal education!  People that have to fight every day of their lives against prejudice, poverty and personal problems - these people didn't choose to live these lives, they try to play the game whatever game it is that seems they're supposed to play but the basic mathematics of the system also result in the unshakable truth that the majority of people will always be poor.  
  
We *could* make it easy on the working class, we *could* give them self autonomy and try to make their lives that little bit more bearable, we *could* be the crutch they lean on when in need so they can get back on their feet.

People that can vote for anyone they like because everyone's against them,  people that can only afford to buy the items made by their slavers because their slavers pay them so little....  This has been repeated timelessly through history; people that get pushed to the very bottom and held there, they grow angry the more they're ignored.  
  
Look at the BBC today, they're talking to every single person that's complaining about it and making clever statements about how everyone is together in anger at the few people who rioted.... while in the background you hear the general rabble of people shouting about injustice and wilful ignorance.  That's how it works, they try to ignore the real problems and the real issues and blame it on a few angry thug idiots confused about a single event - that's not the issue and that's not the split, a large portion of the population is angry about a lot more than just one act of police brutality.

Yes there are organisations, but they are always struggling, they never have enough resources and they can't help all the youths they'd like to. Don't forget that a lot of these charities have lost their funding recently. Your statement is in large part conjecture.

&gt; What might be better is to stop saying ""we need more community centres"" and say ""what can we do at age 6 to stop people developing an attitude that crime is an acceptable route out of poverty"".

Firstly, it seems kind of dumb that local councils close these community centres on one hand, and on the other the charities who help vulnerable children have their funding cut. 

Further to this, what's wrong with giving youths places they can go which stops them hanging around, forming gangs and committing crimes?

&gt; ""what can we do at age 6 to stop people developing an attitude that crime is an acceptable route out of poverty"".

I think this is slightly absurd. Do you really think that kids are doing this to escape poverty, or because they've given up on escaping? You can have teachers and parents do everything they possibly can to try and steer kids in the right direction, but if they see a state that has forgotten them, which has taken away any form of positive involvement in their lives, then what's left?

Modric is proven in the premier league. Italian players often struggle in the premier league due to how much more physical it is. The Italian league is one of the least physical that I know of. Rossi would also be used to having more time on the ball than he would in the premier league. In Italy they don't press nearly as much as we do in the UK.

Modric creates the pace of play from the ground up. He creates space like an absolute master and conducts the next steps of play. Like Carrick used to. To me, VdV gets too involved in attack to do this where Modric will often play from a deep position if he's playing centre.

Modric is a senior player and very important to the club, its players and its fans. I got upset with him after he wanted to leave, but now apparently he didn't hand in a transfer request so, to me, he kept his word. 

I believe he should be vice captain. Yesterday against Bilbao Dawson was shaky as fuck. Someone wrote a comment about how Dawson is solid when playing next to King or Gallas; but when with Kaboul or Bassong he isn't as confident and that is so true. We cannot have a captain like that. Modric is the unflappable type. Senior member of the squad with a commanding role. Vice captain in my books especially after his welcome back to the lane by the lilywhite faithful.

I'm assuming the Doctor found a way to melt them down without pain, leaving the flesh still alive and essentially killing nothing and injuring no one, just rearranging the form of Amy-ganger.

No, that's absolutely not true.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"i'm sure if the 'bunch of chavs' had an official media department that produced bits of paper to impress people then they too would have a similar story.  
  
The point i'm trying to make here is that the phrase 'bunch of chavs' is a special form of ad hom fallacy well ingrained in our British mind; it's classism pure and simple.  By saying that this was just thick chavs our for blood we're saying that because it was lower class people we shouldn't listen to their complaints, this is surely absurd reasoning - certainly if we're letting governments get away with the same thing unquestioned.  
  
Were people angry at the BBC because the BBC has a history of whitewashing class struggle just as they were doing with this?  Was this a rage at the machine which so wilfully overlooks their poverty?  Did the group associate the middle class camera crew and high paid celebrity face with some form of social dichotomy?  
  
When dogs bark a sensible person checks for burglars before blaming the moon.  It turned out that Muslim Extremest factions didn't hate us for our freedoms after all, it wasn't a crazy hatred of injection moulded plastic and mock-adobe kitchen furnishings, it was actually the intense history of checkbook terrorism which OBL and others had wrote, spoken and screamed about until they were blue in the face - 'they just hate us' was a much more politically useful tool than 'we've fucked them hard and they're pretty pissed' in exactly the same way that 'they're just violent chavs' is a much more politically expedient phrase than 'the urban poor are really suffering and while everyone has been purposely ignoring them they've developed a real rage which has overflowed onto the streets in response to yet another suspected police cover up' 
  
This has got as much to do with the BBC, et all not caring that the MET have recently been proven to be deeply corrupt via the News International scandal but no ones talking about the real issues because to them the real issues are share prices and that kind of bullshit.  The exact same way the bbc will talk about eternally rising rents as 'good for buy-to-let landlords' without referencing the growing economic problems of the people that need to live somewhere to do their bullshit low paid but eventually necessary job.
  
The media are very complicit in the cover ups, they tell the stories the way we're supposed to hear them - this much is painfully obvious if you've ever actually been to a protest or riot they report on or part of a public enquiry they forget to mention the juicy bits of...  I'm not saying the average kappa wearing youth could write a chomskyesk thesis on bias in the media however they understand it implicitly, personally and socially - examples are all around them, the bull shit is so obvious when it's fall on you.  
  
The rules of engagement you speak of are a concept invented by the people who created the whole system of polite oppression, of checkbook terrorism and silent class warfare - the BBC aren't impartial observers, they're part of the machine.  I happen to know some BBC guys and i even like some of them as friends, of course they're not personally evil however they are part of a machine which is at odds with 'the struggle' and in this regard when you're hitting shit walls and it's balls to the fan then all truth be told i expect most of them, somewhere deep down, silently cheer the people chasing them out of town - they know what they're a part of and that they don't really have any choice but to be part of it, they also know that a broken windscreen is a great story and no one was really trying to kill them.  
  
It's been well established in the governments that rules of engagement change depending on the enemy, well not to defend anyone who attacks another human but in this instance there is a good argument for ejecting the institution that is the bbc - maybe it'll allow space for other more 'grounded' reports to convey a populist bias rather than a nanny state bedtime story?

As I see it, here's what's up.

Each person has their own subjective sense of time (that which I experienced and have memory of is my past, that which I have not yet experienced is my future).
In addition to this, there is a universal time ""stream"" which exists and through which the Doctor travels willy nilly.

For most of us non-TARDISed humans, there is no conflict nor inconsistency between the two; our subjective timelines always move in the same direction as the universe's.  The Doctor, however, skips around and does things in Series 5 that are later for him and earlier for the Universe.

The idea of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff largely seems useless to me other than to say ""paradoxes aren't really a problem"" (meaning that events in 2011 AD can influence events in 2005 AD, provided there's a tweed-wearing time traveler involved)

As to the fixed points thing, it's a little bit tenuous at best, in my opinion.

Second, She is the weapon that Madame Kovarian is making her into a weapon, and that she was conceived in the time vortex. Madame Vastra asks if she could even regenerate, to which the doctor says that he doesn't know. We know that the little girl from Day of the Moon can regenerate. Third, the doctor has a flashback to River saying that the little girl must have been incredibly strong to have torn herself out of the space suit, implying that the little girl was Amy and Rory's daughter.](/spoiler)

[So, we know (to a reasonable extent, at least) that River was at one point in the space suit. We also know that River was/is in prison for killing a good man, and it seems likely that the good man is the doctor.](/spoiler)

Now, all that being said, I would be somewhat disappointed if that's all there is too it. There has been too much build up, and that just seems too obvious for a Moffat plot.

Rory is the good man. kaosjester makes a good case for this in his/her [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/jbbnv/potential_spoilerwell_more_like_a_predictiondont/c2aq4qu) and I don't have anything to add.

[Also possible, either he or Amy were in the suit. I would like to see Rory as the one in the suit, that would add even more to is badassery. Amy as the one who killed the doctor would be interesting as well; she took it the worst, by far. That also seems a little more likely, because in the panel at comic con, she revealed that she knows a secret about the show, and one reason for that would be for her to know that she is the one that killed the doctor.](/spoiler)",0,1312753673,null,0,false,0,c2atcor,t3_jbbnv,t1_c2atcor,t3_jbbnv,1427443074,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I'm not an anarchist per say, but I do believe that *this* state should be dissolved. And don't forget *The State* is just the collective actions of the people, so if one is rotten so is the other. For many seeing Wikileaks and News Corp, every institution from the MET, journalism, the judicial service, the financial system to parliament, now has no clothes. Moral failings at the highest level are punishable by moderate embarrassment and the occasional resignation. 'Crimes' (and non-crimes) for the lowest are harsh, ranging from Topiary's banning from the internet, the various black-youths being shot, the quick sentencing to 6 weeks for a pie in the face (compare that to the Tomlinson case that hasn't see any similar 'swift justice'), 150 peaceful protestors arrested.

&gt; burning and looting for the hell of it?

People (unless they are psychologically damaged) just don't do things for the hell of it. I see people more like molecules than morally guided beings, where behaviour is a product of external conditions. Casting judgement on individuals, or believing the ill of this world can be attributed to a personal failing or a broken moral compass, I believe is not helpful. I see incidents like this as a direct consequence of political and economic malfeasance, and the spin of 'misbehaving youths' is a coordinated misdirection. It's hard for many to empathise with facets of the system when they are ostracised in every possible way, whilst the life that they could be having is rammed down their throats at every turn.

The echo chamber which is our media has taught discontented youths that the only way to get coverage and change things is to riot in the most visually pleasing way possible, so they can't be surprised when that's exactly what they do.

I'm not trying to justify looting - it'd be far better for their cause if they'd protested politically significant targets - but the other issue is that nobody has ever really taught these kids *how* to express dissent. I'm not saying it should be a primary school class or anything, but these kids are angry and, likely as not, nobody has ever tried to reach out to them and teach them exactly what to get angry at.

Really worried where this is going to end up. Likely as not, they'll all get locked up and nothing will change, which is a real shame.

Back to Tottenham: I came across this tweet from a Guardian journalist at the scene:

&gt; [#Stabbing victims friends refusing to cooperate with police. ""Why do u think everything's going on? Because we fucking hate you.""](https://twitter.com/#!/PaulLewis/status/100326343501295617)

I think that sums it up. The people are actually fighting the police. Oh and this:

&gt; [""If a senior police officer had come to speak to us, we would have left. We arrived at 5pm, we had planned a one-hour silent protest. We were there until 9pm. Police were absolutely culpable. Had they been more responsive when we arrived at the police station, asking for a senior officer to talk with the family, we would have left the vicinity before the unrest started.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/07/tottenham-community-leaders?CMP=twt_gu)

When people are angry, spontaneity tends to rule. If I could impart one belief it would be that every news organisation exists to shape the narrative, not to report it, as does the police to protect the status quo. Notice how many reports open with the police casualty count. The same thing happened with the student protests, and that was when I lost trust in the Guardian actually.

The fact that your entire premise relies on it.

And my point is basically that unless this specific evolution in human consciousness occurs that changes how people in general think about these things, it's massively more likely that after the current world as we know it falls and burns, from the ashes people will simply form new governments. Maybe they'll be freer, fairer, adapted, learning from mistakes. Maybe they'll be even more draconian. But it is almost inescapable that they will form. We may evolve our thinking to the point where we don't form governments in the stupid way we have them now, that would be something - but to assume we'll all cooperate eternally without anyone forming such a structure seems almost inconceivable to me.

And anything else really does rely on some paradigm shift in the way humans think - there's no indication otherwise. You'd literally have to eliminate greed from the human psyche in order for someone to not strive for power. I say it's better to have a system that everyone is part of that doesn't allow that to happen in the first place, a government as a means to end tyranny and all the bullshit it causes. I see this as the best chance we've got, *if* the collapse managed to take the powerful from power (it may not at all, I can only speculate on the dynamics of what would happen - and perhaps more importantly what happens between now and then).

Also, you think I should learn what anarchism is - maybe you should learn what government is. Just because you don't like existing governments, it doesn't mean that no other form of government could satisfy at least most of the concepts of freedom an anarchist might aspire to, while acheiving the above: a damned good assurance that we won't slip back into tyranny.

&gt; People who try to persuade humans that they should aspire to live in an anarchist society are trying to make a positive impact.

See, this I can understand - I am against current forms of government entirely (if for nothing else, for their shortsigtedness of the facts that will lead to the collapse of society), and I do actually think they will all collapse in the near future (0-40 years) or at least massively drastic changes will occur in society to the point where our world today will be hardly recognisable. These ideas (that might seem outlandish to most) are based firmly in reality, and I only continue with realism to form my outlook on what would happen afterwards. And I'm not even ""against"" anarchy as much as I think it unattainable.

And unless I've slipped up somewhere, I've never used an absolute - I've never outright said it can't happen for 100% definite, but on the scale of things I just see it as such a small possibility that the seriousness with which some people strive for it just seems a little misguided and maybe pointless - I'd rather chase an idea with a bigger chance of success.",0,1312765216,null,0,false,0,c2aul6y,t3_jbtcw,t1_c2aul6y,t1_c2auefp,1427443656,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,Talonwhal,null,null,"We're already on the track to unimaginable catastrophe, but these problems are never fully realised until they actually happen. A paradigm shift will come after, but it won't be a *fundamental* change in the way people think - as in it will be a way of thinking that is easily attainable now, but there's currently no stimulus for us to do so.

The problems with things like greed is that if you have worldwide anarchism, for example, then someone decides to form a power structure, without a more powerful power structure already in place to keep it in check there's a good chance it could thrive - these things self-perpetuate and can cause all kinds of evil even if unintentionally. Much in the way governments and corporations do, regardless of their original or supposed intent. And it's not just greed that gets people there - it's seemingly benign wants, goals, targets, anything that can act as a driving force for change.

I believe in democracy to the extent that people get a say in government - not the jokes of democracy we have in the world today. And I do mean all of them throughout all of history. No one has ever done it right or well, but I use that word because the basic premise of it is sound and it's the best way I know of conveying the idea. Sorry if the word is too tarnished in your eyes, I'll gladly take another word if you know of one.

So sue me if I haven't thought of a perfect solution just yet, I'm a busy guy :(

But in all seriousness the fundamentals of what I believe should be, is a perpetuating system that doesn't necessarily require any growth or change, but does require rules. It also requires enforcers of those rules (as rules do), in a way that doesn't focus power or command, especially power that can affect someone else. I don't think rules should restrict freedom, but that they should restrict the restriction of freedom. In essence it would be a fundamentally *designed* state with the intention of maintaining itself as it is for the most part. Change wouldn't be impossible but it would be a slow and involved process. These are just a few random outlines of precepts, but you can probably see where I'd going.

But one of the main purposes of a system would be basically to prevent competition. As I believe governments will form, I say put one there first - one that will stop other ones from forming; but one that will be benign. After all, if we had anarchy 2 million years ago, and we ended up as we are now - why shouldn't it just happen again? And what if a government forms that is absolutely terrible and so hardened that it gives little to no possibility of collapse or defeat?

Anyway, I don't believe that simply because governments don't work, they can't work. I don't believe that any extant governments were designed or thought out well enough. Checks and balances don't work when a few people can change or circumvent them in a way that affect other people. Checks and balances have never been designed well either, but again I don't believe that means they can't be.

If this all sounds very idealist to you, you would be right. If it sounds naiive then you should probably consider your own views just as naiive.",0,1312767999,null,0,false,0,c2auwfw,t3_jbtcw,t1_c2auwfw,t1_c2aun0x,1427443803,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It's sad but public opinion means nothing in today's politics. The way I understand Britain is there are a lot of mal-educated people that know that there is something wrong because their lives feel horrible, but can't actually see the real mechanism of oppression, so lash out at the most visible antagonists as they see it. With a constant supply of gaudy superficial rich folk and consumerism, which is supposed to be inspirational (the Royal wedding, over paid sportsmen, cribs, loose women, Britains got talent), which all encourage or embody a sense of entitlement and envy. Meanwhile, intelligence is actively suppressed:

* science is made to look boring, geeky (think every film you have ever seen, ever), and instead children are supposed to aspire to be on the front of a magazine (NME or Vogue), be the lastest music abomination, sportsman, or vacuous soap actor;
* every opportunity to take credibility from science is made: 'scientist wants to take away your beer', 'breathing gives you cancer', etc;
* every opportunity to reduce conversation to the level of who is fucking who is taken;
* intellect is reduced to knowing facts, just like the national curriculum.

So the disenfranchised people are kept ignorant, but they are angry (usually nicely contained as hatred for the other football team, or infighting between ethnicities). Then there are the contented stupid, those with a good enough job to afford a mortgage, their sky tv subscription and some grotty holiday with the kids in Spain or some such each year. They don't really care as long as they get to watch the latest idol and get pissed of a weekend, they think they are middle class.

The middling class, have generally comfortable lives, and can intellectually empathise with the lowest class, but they fail to engage emotionally whilst they sit on their chaise lounge from ikea sipping an instant latté.

The middle class are perhaps mostly too well rewarded to care, or damn busy with their jobs and personal success. And the top 0.1% profit from the system so are keen for it to remain. Of course there will be the occasional uprising, race riots in Oldham, students or some ghastly ghetto somewhere, but that is generally corrected by a tweaking of the *bread and circuses*.

The real mechanisms of oppression are television, the monetary system which favours the rich and devalues labour, and the education system that imparts no personal means of value creation (or real creative or critical thinking), instead opting for a fact base learning system with the aim to create mini-employees to service the needs of a company.

Carra? How much more is Vidic - will likely feature more and be a part of a better defense. Ivanvoic/Terry is also worth a good look, maybe Kompany too. Definitely better than Carra, if only because he'll probably be injured more.

If taking a Chelsea defender, I'd probably go for Cole - more reliable, will be a certain feature in the starting XI, although Luiz may score more directly.

I don't like your central midfielders. Lampard, Giggs, Arteta, Lucas Leiva, Modric, Nasri should all produce more.

Suarez is a good choice. Aguero is again a question mark - he may succeed but he could also falter. Maybe someone like Rooney or Chicarito there. Not sure why you'd take Sinclair - someone like Kuyt or Sturridge should produce more.

If that came off mean, sorry, but you don't get better at art by tracing, it actually makes you *worse* because once you switch to freehand you'll be trying to imitate the overall shape and not focusing on building your image from the smaller ones.

**Thirty years of hate: Britain's worst race riots**

**1981**: More than 300 people are injured, including 279 police officers, as black men hurl petrol bombs in Brixton, south London. The two-day clash causes £6.5m damage. Later in the year there is another riot in Brixton, as well as riots in Manchester, Southall and Toxteth, Liverpool, where a man is killed.

**1985**: Trouble flares up again in Handsworth, Birmingham. Black rioting leaves two people dead and dozens of buildings gutted by firebombs. More than 50 cars are set alight and two shops gutted.

**1985**: Broadwater Farm. White PC Keith Blakelock is hacked to death in a racist murder by men with knives and machetes.

**1995**: A policeman is almost kicked to death after being pulled off his motorcycle during a second immigrant riot in Brixton.

**1995**: Three nights of fighting causes more than £1m worth of damage after gangs of Asian youths run wild in Manningham, Bradford.

**1998**: A group of 100 youths throw bottles, cans and stones at police as the five suspects of the murder of teenager Stephen Lawrence arrive at the inquiry.

**2001**: Bradford, Oldham, Leeds, Burnley. Muslim Asian youths fight on the streets of northern towns, hurling petrol bombs and stones. Eighty police officers are injured in Bradford alone.

**2005**: ‘Black British’ and ‘black Asians’ riot for two consecutive nights, with both groups committing a string of violent crimes against each other, including two murders.",0,1312779916,null,0,true,0,c2aw8rq,t3_jc4gk,t1_c2aw8rq,t3_jc4gk,1427444435,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

I suspect that in this case the dead man was dragged from the mini cab and shot, with a bullet fragment ricocheting back and hitting the radio.

Time is made of two parts. Most of it is in flux (it can be changed) but certain points are definite. They have to happen. 

Think of an incredibly long chain packed tightly into a ball. The parts of the chain that make up and define the outside of the ball are set in place. They can't move, they can't change. Now, all of the chain on the inside can move. It can change shape.

Now imagine that you start at one end of the chain (the past) and move along in one direction (towards the future). You will inevitably hit the edges at certain points, and it will always be the same when you hit them. The rest, however, can shift freely. You can move along it, but it may turn and move and change.

Now imagine the Tardis as being able to jump from one chainlink to another without having to move down the chain. It can go from one part of the chain to another, possibly miles down the chainlinks, very quickly without following the chain directly. The Doctor can then alter the direction of the chain from there, provided that it isn't one of the anchored points of the chain.

This is to stop the Police from telling anyone their version of events in  case they are misleading the public, as sometimes happens.

Please.
  
When a police officer discharges their weapon, their intent is for it be deadly, regardless of bullet type used.  
The benefit of hollow point ammo is to prevent over-penetration and injury of others.  
The fact that a radio stopped this bullet is evidence of that attribute.  
In the event that a person survives a police shooting, they are commonly in an area where medical assistance can quickly be brought to them, the team involved will also include medical personnel trained in trauma stabilisation and there is usually no extended firefight after the person is incapacitated which will not delay medical response as a war zone would.

A bullet to the head is deadly, whether fired by police or soldier, hollow or full jacket point so hyperventilating over police using these is simply sensationalism at best and misleading rhetoric at worst.

Anyway, why do you care? You seem to be quite happy encouraging the permanent disabling of people for just talking shit on twitter. That's really admirable for such a socially conscious guy like you.

The following is not to even try to convince you, but in the hope that others might be reading this.  
The reasons the military don't use them:  
- due to lower accuracy at the extended ranges of engagement with standard military weapons   
- extended periods of firefights, preventing medical personnel to offer aid to those shot  
- reduced jamming of weapons with soft/flat/hollow point ammo  
- remote areas where wars are fought, making aid to wounded less possible  
- needing to penetrate cover, such as trees, wood, thin walls.  
- a wounded enemy is more valuable than dead as it takes troops from the front line to recover and send them to aid stations.

In the UK Hollowpoints are *required* ammunition in hunting due to their more humane feature of quick incapacitation.

true,cptjmshook,null,null,"To my mind it's a few things:

1) There is no semiotic relationship between the *characters* on Stargate and the stargate itself. There is no semiotic relationship between the *crew* of the starship Enterprise and the starship Enterprise. There is, however, a semiotic relationship between the TARDIS and the Doctor, in that the blue police box, indigenous to British streets, is immediately evocative of Britain in much the same way that the character of the Doctor is quintessentially British. Additionally, the TARDIS, being (well, technically *resembling*) a police box, is quite naturally emblazoned with the word ""POLICE"", a fitting label for the Doctor, who is essentially the policeman of the universe.

2) The very word ""icon"" connotes visual simplicity. Just look at religious iconography (the crucifix, the star of David), political iconography (the republican Elephant, the democratic Donkey, the communist Hammer and Sickle, the anarchist Circle-A) or corporate iconography (the Windows flag, the Macintosh apple, the Taco Bell bell, McDonalds' ""golden arches""). All of those symbols, or icons, are visually simplistic, easily recognizable and immediately evocative of their brand. Now is there anything more visually simplistic than the TARDIS? It is essentially a big blue rectangle, already an icon of itself. No wonder it lends itself so well to being ""iconic"".

3) In the vast majority of episodes of Doctor Who, the TARDIS is parked in an environment to which it is glaringly alien.

Well, I am massively pro-freedom, but I believe in a sustained freedom that isn't going to fall to the next warmonger/dictator/greed-driven/big-dreaming/ambitious person/whatever that comes along. I figure the only way to stop opression from happening is to manage freedom as a massive collective, instead of just relying on a vague collective ""want"" with no defined structure and rules and hope everything goes okay.

Plus, as I've said I think people are neturally inclined to form groups with some sort of rules, which become enforced, which become laws, which become enforced by designated enforcers, etc. Better to put a structure in place that won't get out of control than rely on one that isn't well designed (like all of the ones throughout history) taking root instead.

&gt; I still get the impression that you don't understand that the political philosophy known as anarchism has more to it than lawlessness.

I think this is mostly your problem, not mine - there is no political philosophy called anarchism, there's 50 political philosophies called anarchism :P I know a lot about it, but I also know of a lot of contradictory ideas within it - I'm not saying you hold contradictory ideas, I'm saying that 2 people following a philosophy called anarchism can hold massively contradictory ideas as it is not well defined at all.

&gt; And, you are still jumping to conclusions about what I think despite me not being too specific about it.

So following from the above, maybe you should enlighten me as to if there's a better definition of what you believe (maybe kinda like me being ""pro-democracy"", haha - misleading at best). Are there certain authors whose theories you are particularly inclined towards, for example?

It cheapens humanity as a whole to say that Van Gogh was only so brilliant because aliens gave him visions.  It cheapens humanity to say that Einstein or Tesla were space aliens beyond our understanding.  It certainly cheapens the atrocities of Jack the Ripper or whoever to say ""oh well he was possessed by martians"" or ""he was really a vampire from outer space"" or whatnot.  

In fact, I'd *love* to see a bit in the forthcoming Hitler episode where the Doctor point-blank says that Hitler's doings were of his own free will, his own accord, and were his own idea.  There's no alien influence or anything like that - Hitler was just a plain old human being with some terrible, awful ideas, and ordinary people believed him and followed him and did his bidding - not because he used alien technology to brainwash them or anything, but out of regular old fear and paranoia and propaganda.

That's **why** the Doctor loves humanity so - yes, we created Idi Amin and weaponized anthrax and Uday Hussein, but we also created Albert Einstein and roller coasters and Beethoven and Prince!

He would regularly accept invitations from jailers and prison wardens to try and escape from their facilities - and he always did.  He once had himself sewn into a giant football and escaped from that.  

He was too old to serve in World War I, so he wrote a pamphlet for the US Army detailing the basics of lockpicking, how to escape from handcuffs, etc. so soldiers could use his knowledge if they got captured.  

A big part of his escape routine was his warning that you had all better be grateful that he was a good man and dedicated to truth and justice, because nobody could ever stop him if he became a criminal.

Later in life, he became pretty much the world's first Mythbuster, going in disguises to seances and magic shows, then revealing exactly how the hoaxers did their tricks - it cost him his friendship with Arthur Conan Doyle.

He died, on Halloween, of peritonitis.  This happened because it was a known thing that Houdini had such control of his ab muscles that men could punch him in the gut and he wouldn't flinch.

I'm of the view that demonising the Police and turning the situation into an ""us and ""them"" scenario, with society polarized between supporting the Police fully, or hating the Police fully is an awful idea.

We should all agree that we want good Policing, and we want bad Police officers gone. That's something we all agree on, and usually Police officers feel most passionately about this issue (from friends who have family members serving, nobody gets angrier about Police violence than decent Police officers).

We shouldn't angrily go hating on the coppers or in this case, the rioters totally and completely. We should want to punish any individuals who have unjustly broken the law.

I want to see abusive Police officers, and looting rioters together behind bars. However, I want to see neither the Police as a whole, or any group of protestors as a whole hated viciously regardless of the situation.

true,maskedcoconut,null,null,"I'm not quite sure how I feel about this, I just graduated with a degree in Mathematics so I think I know a thing or two about it. The report mainly seems to say that the current syllabus up to GCSE is failing those less talented at maths, this I agree is true and I always put it down to bad teaching and how the majority of teachers didn't seem that good at maths themselves. What it doesn't do is go into how the current system is also failing the more gifted mathematics students. 

Let me explain a few things from my perspective, I found both GCSE and A-level Mathematics and Further Mathematics extremely easy, my main reason for studying the subject up to A-level was because of how easy I found it. Talking to my friends from university (all on a Mathematics course) this seems to have been a pretty universal experience. Pre-university Mathematics from what I remember is based around poorly taught repetition, if you're not naturally gifted this quickly leads to frustration, if you are naturally gifted like I was it leads to boredom. So no one is really happy. The problem is that pre-university mathematics is largely uninspiring and gives no clue to what University or ""real maths"" is like. This means that many people who are gifted and could go into some mathematical related discipline, that we are constantly told is needed for our economy, don't. The report doesn't address this issue at all and is more interested in getting everyone to know how to do mathematics for the real world (admittedly this is important too).

Frankly I'm also a bit confused why Carol Vorderman is treated like an expert on this, according to wikipedia she got a third class degree in engineering. I guess policy reports are only taken seriously in this country now if they have a famous face behind them. 

I'm also a bit sceptical on the whole GCSE Arithmetic thing, my personal opinion is that learning great arithmetic skills is a bit useless. Sure know what a fraction and percentage and what basic stats are, know how to calculate them on a calculator (in real world you can always get a calculator), be able to do simpler calculations in your head etc. But an entire GCSE or even going onto age 18 on it? Better to bring on the imaginary numbers I say!

true,[deleted],null,null,"Everything you have said here makes me think your political views fit into the broad sphere of anarchism. 

The reason why I have said that you need to read up on anarchism is that despite indicating you might be an anarchist, you seem to think that anarchism is just not having any rules or leaders. 

I am glad you understand that anarchism is a multi-faceted thing and of course two people calling themselves anarchists might hold wildly divergent views. 

But I am not aware of any type of anarchism that calls for abandonment of all rules, laws, organisations, hierarchies altogether. 

I think anarchism means having systems for managing society which are non-coercive, transparent and allow for all participants to have their say and contribute without force or alienation. 

Are there a thousand different ideas you can have around this? Yes.

As to what I believe or think, I don't know if I can ""enlighten"" you as such. Generally I view things from a leftist-anarchist point of view. I think capitalism and the acquisition of wealth should be rejected as immoral. I think property is theft. I think the planet belongs to all the creatures who exist here and no one should take advantage of their evolutionary position to gain benefits for themselves at the expense of others. 

I think people are fundamentally motivated to do something useful with their time but very little of this is represented in the current system. I think the idea of work and jobs within the current economic framework is coercive and depends on steering humans' mindset to be compliant and obedient and not make the best of spirit and intellect. 

I can't say what or whose philosophy I most identify with. In my distant youth I read all the typical stuff - the Kropotkin, Bakunin and Proudhon. I can't remember if any of those guys said anything I would now specifically agree or disagree with. I am not an academic or a scholar. 

I have read Chomsky, Emma Goldman, Malatesta. I have found anarchism in Sartre, Phil Dick, Pilger, Buddhism, Bebop music and Rock n' Roll, Frank Zappa, Hermann Hesse, Henry Miller and the Permaculture movement. 

Maybe it's easier to point to what is not anarchism. 

The State is not anarchism. Government is not anarchism. But I can't define these for you off the top of my head and write a thesis about how you can have leadership and institutions that are not State or Government. 

EDIT: Ah! One book I still possess which has an amazing wealth of writings about anarchism as a political philosophy is called The Anarchist Reader edited by George Woodcock.

The news goes viral, twitter and blogs convey the details of stories which the press won't touch; Damilola Taylor, Charles de Mendez, Imran Farooq, Stephen Lawrence, Daniel Morgan - names which echo.  [The Met covering up police brutality](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23765462-met-tries-to-cover-up-photographs-of-police-without-ids.do), [The Met covering up police brutality](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/apr/09/g20-police-assault-ian-tomlinson-g20), [The Met covering up rape by it's officers](http://www.womenagainstrape.net/inthemedia/met-police-accused-protecting-staff-against-rape-a), [The Met falsifying evidence to stop a rape inquiry](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1328491/Met-police-face-prosecution-halting-rape-trial-using-fake-evidence.html), [the Met covering for it's own](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1197340/Ex-police-chef-denies-cover-embarrassing-incidents-Met-Royal-Protection-division.html)... that's before you even begin to learn about things like the cover up on the Carroll Foundation and all the other white collar crap.  
  
These things build up and build up, the cost of living rises so surviving alone is hard, all the while we see these blind fucks on the bbc talking about how fucking wonderful it is that buy to let landlords can screw ever higher rents out of people without their mortgage contributions going up - no one really talks about the problems everyone they know faces, no one faces up to the reality of life - it's all politic bullshit about all tightening out belts; well fuck you for loosing a billion, if i loose the twenty in my wallet then i'm going to have to go without margarine on my bread or for that matter bread itself after these last six slices!  So you didn't fly to a pleasure island this summer, oh you still did? oh.  
  
A whole portion of society forgets how to feel anything but rage, then someone has been shot dead and the police are acting like they don't give a fuck, where's the visit and the support?  where's someone that can tell us what we want to know?  We've heard enough of 'sorry guys i'd love to help and we really are doing everything we can, just go away and don't complain about it....' well fuck you it's getting dark and a lot of people are going home, well fuck you i ain't going home and i ain't putting up with this!  The nearest police car gets trashed, it feels good kicking back at the system.  Once the beacon is lit the soldiers come to war, this is how it's always been.  
  
So yeah, it's real sad some pretty things got fucked up, people weren't fighting for some aesthetic moral principle -they were fighting for survival, they were fighting against the whole fucking system.  In this regard yeah smash the corporate slavers right in the windows, take the things that are made of sweat stolen from your kin, smash them where they'll feel it, where they'll see it on the balance sheets and ledger books.  It is a message that says no we will not play by your *rules of engagement* or your phony *morals* because those are things you've crafted purposely to fuck us over, and it's all different when it's Kabul or Basra you're thinking about - well, fuck - is it any wonder people want to kick them so hard in the windows that their pockets bleed?  is it any wonder?  
  
So whatever reddit, you pretend it's as simple as 'chavs' or 'muslims' or 'darkies' or whatever racist, classist and easy way of thinking makes you feel better about yourself - it's just criminals acting up, it's just idiots not knowing what they're doing.....  keep singing that tune, you wouldn't be the first to fiddle while an evil empire collapses in on itself.",0,1312810789,null,0,true,0,c2ay5su,t3_jcaju,t1_c2ay5su,t3_jcaju,1427445416,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

**The statement the DSA put out about it:**
&gt;‘The association is shocked that a BBC employee has publicised the work of a comedian which is nothing more than a vile offensive rant and conflicts with BBC guidelines which state a responsibility to “protect the vulnerable and avoid unjustifiable offence”. As a public body the BBC should not be promoting the work of such an individual.

Either the DSA are unaware of Stanhope being on the BBC before or they most likely only care now because his Newswipe bits didn't touch on their particular Taboo. That I can remember anyway.

However now that they've got a apology from BBC and Bacon then I guess that means all is forgotten by the looks of things. They're so disgusted that all it took was a generic written apology to move on. The clip/bit still exists so if you're going to be outraged at least go full retard to stop more people from stumbling upon this ""vile offensive rant"".

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"haha i'm not asking you to support it, that would be absurd - we can't just go smashing shit up for no reason now, no one ever *supports* reckless destruction however we must understand why it comes about.  
  
I don't think i've ever met a single human that wasn't an opportunist, it's pretty fucking hard wired in our brain - it was opportunists that first collected fire and it was opportunists that got swindled huge tubs of money from the bailout.  Who doesn't want free stuff?  
  
The point is under normal conditions we have a certain social code, it's loosely based around the principle that we've all got to get through this and lets try not to jar off anyone too badly...  That's the theory and for some people it works, you get a nice house and a car but you devote your life to work while enjoying your spare time but for some people they can't have anywhere to live, they can't have a car and because of all sorts of bullshit they get kicked back to square -1 every time they progress.  
  
Irrational numbers might be hard for most people to understand but the concept of being a little less than zero no matter how far forward you go is easily understood by those that have to live it every fucking day.  The system we expect people to live in is irrational, out politics is irrational, our police are irrational, our moral code is irrational.  
  
Why should people at their wits end care about out moral code or our social justice?  
  
So no i don't think these people should smash up anything, but i understand why they might want to and i understand why they may feel they *have to* - society isn't listening to them, it doesn't care - we get some mindless politic about the bankers loosing some paper money and that translates to *us* getting screwed while *they* get billions of pounds.  For fuck sake BILLIONS?!!?? You had billions up your sleeve for when a load of richass bankers mutalate the economy out of sheer greed and nothing ever comes of it?  Where the fuck were those billions when we're living in slums?  Where were those billions when you close down our youth centre? where were those billions when you *had to* sell everything to your richass friends so they could put the prices up?  
  
Rent is too damm high.  That's the real fucking problem, not a joke - not a fucking joke.  People are being screwed and screwed and screwed and no one is mentioning it, they can't feel it or see it.  
  
Well guess what?  look at the night sky glow orange, look at your pretty chain stores burning?  The fire's in the highroad will burn the bastards the only place they have any sensation, their pockets.  
  
Well, that's basically how i'd expect a member of the disenfranchised youth to feel; it's the same narrative we gave Greece, France and the rest of the worlds protests - why are ours any different?  
  
Society needs to change, people need to realise society needs to change.  Constantly screwing over everyone that can be screwed is simply going to make a pressure cooker bomb.
  
And lo, this is but the start - if we don't start to change NOW the follow up of the continual economic collapse is going to burn the entire country down, we have to introduce systems by which everyone has a good life, this myth of social mobility is absolute bollocks - there will always be people doing the workers jobs, when we stop so do the wheels - this is why we're having these problems; we tried to shift our entire society into an aristocracy of greed.  Buy -to-let, public private partnerships, big society - these things are all about pretending we can all be in the top 10%, well sorry but half the population are always going to be below average; we need to shore up the foundations of our society, we need to make room for people to breath, economic breathing room and social breathing room.  
  
THIS is why i've been expecting violence on the streets of London for some years now, this is why i understand that until the problem is faced these things will continue to happen.  Just telling people 'derpderp they were stupid black criminal chavs' is not going to make this go away.

do they owe us a living?  
OF COURSE THEY DO, OF COURSE THEY DO, OF COURSE THEY FUCKING DO!!!!!!  
  
But why?  well that's simple, we're basically animals which have domesticated ourselves, if you took a wolf from the forest and brought him home and kept him inside, you'd be expected to feed him right?  and if you didn't and he ate you? little sympathy i suspect.  People are the same, only more complex - we've been brought in from the wild into 'the system' and for some people 'the system' works out rather well, they make mistakes and the government bail them out however other people for whatever they try and however they try it the system just shits on them; this is not fair and these people like the wolf has every right to bite the hand which doesn't feed.  
  
Now, before you get all right wing in my face consider this mathematical model of the world, a large number or working class jobs require a smaller quantity of supervisor jobs - keep stacking this up and you'll end up with something which looks rather like the Feudal System...  We NEED a working class, we can't simply expect everyone that cleans a floor or serves behind a till to work harder and become a computer scientist, what the fuck would we do with a world full of staving computer scientists unable to turn on their computers because the power stopped worked and their too hungry to think?!?!?  
  
We NEED a working class, this much is painfully obvious even to the most absurdly out of touch tory - so we have a social system where by we're supposed to manage things so the working class can work, the middle class can fuck each other and the posh can fuck themselves - that's the theory, however it's never been even close to that in practice.  
  
So basically what's happened is we've taken an animal, caged it, refused to give it food, beaten it when it's made a mess finding it's own food and then we're expecting it to obey our social conventions and not raise it's voice in the house!  Well raggghhhh to you buddy, look at these fangs and think about your attitude.

What they should do is teach maths properly. As you say the relationship between circles and trig is a nice start. Maths should be more about playing with models and demonstrating why something is correct or not. They could do with reducing both the formality and the number of rote methods taught. Maths is about inventing completely imaginary worlds and demonstrating that in that world the following things are true for the following cool reasons. Then you can do things like creating worlds that sort of match something real you want to look at.

Directors will take their final pay pensions and the rest of us will loose out because we're not willing to stand up and take action against it; its going to happen, especially in times of economic difficulty.

People often cite anti-union legislation as a reason for this. I'm not sure about this because in the past (going back a hundred years or so) any form of industrial action was completely illegal, if enough of workers are willing to go for it they can't really just throw them all in prison.

Also, if anyone tries to say ""we don't want to go back to the 1970s etc"" tell them that at least you'll have a fucking pension at the end of it.

Don't get me wrong, I don't want the streets piling up with rubish or the world coming to an end but unless there is some form of dialogue between directors and regular employees that goes beyond the legal minimum most of us will loose out.

This means you have large groups of kids who even if they did 100% on their Exam can only pass. Why would any of those take it in A-Level, and how much of their teaching time is D-F material.

Why do we tell 2/3rds of kids in highschool they are not good enough to get an A from the start? Being told you are in the 'Lower class' or the 'Middle class' doesn't exactly make you feel like you're doing well in the subject. Even if you are doing well in your class, you feel like there is this unobtainable difficult material out of your reach.

I won a Silver-award for some math contest (beating a few of the 'smart' kids in the 'Upper class'), yet I was in the middle class so could only achieve a B, they wouldn't even teach me A material.

But anyway, the real problem I have with this is that you are assuming that all people will consider all types of governments to be bad things. I consider all current governments to be bad and I am not against the idea of getting rid of them all, but I am for another type of government in its place.

But before we start arguing semantics of what government is and isn't, it'd probably be better if you read the last few comments I wrote in the thread with JackIsidore [http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/jbtcw/its_probably_my_own_fault_for_trying_to_engage/c2auwfw](here) - just in case we'd end up going over the same things again with regards to that :P

Then, since customers are used to commercial breaks the channels that are only available with cable packages do the same.

Personally I don't watch a lot of regular television.  There's a handful of shows I enjoy, but I usually watch them online to avoid the commercials.  The interruptions are something you just are used to when every show you've ever seen has them and that can make shows seem faster-paced.  Other than that, it's just going to vary by network and time slot.  Lots of prime time stuff is overly dramatic to try to draw people in.

The shows with the most acclaim and recognition, though, either work this set-up very well or are on a ""specially paid for"" network that does things a different way.  Case in point, Dexter, which is fairly slow-paced for a US show, or The Walking Dead.  Traditionally prime time has been eaten up by sitcoms and dumbed-down dramas, the ""good"" stuff is either on later or at odd hours.

Another case in point, when I first got into Doctor Who it was on the SciFi channel at four in the morning every third Thursday except sometimes when they would play a whole season at once all day long (this was right before they lost the license).

I believe there's too much emphasis on what to think and not _how_ to think in schools and introducing the concepts of higher maths would be an excellent addition to the syllabus. However, I think schools should be about making sure you're properly prepared for the world and with the greatest respect to what is obviously your passion, higher maths just isn't a priority in day to day life. Making sure people can work with percentages is more beneficial to the populace than the workings of topology, for example.

Saying that, I've been watching The Code and The History of Mathematics on the BBC recently and found it very interesting, if frustrating at times.

true,SendInTheNinjas,null,null,"I only took maths GCSE because I was forced to. If it wasn't a compulsory subject, I seriously would have ditched it. I loathed maths lessons for a number of reasons. Firstly, I have a mild form of dyscalcula, which is like dyslexia for numbers, and I find reading long or complex sets of numbers difficult. Also nothing we learnt had any real-world applications. Once you get past being able to read a bus timetable and make sure you're not short-changed at tesco, you don't need anything they teach you. So I was sat in a lesson about equations thinking a) this is hard and b) this is stupid, which led to me getting a severe headache every single lesson, and we had 8 lessons a week of that rubbish. 

I didn't fail the exam, because like with all my other subjects I did as I was told and studied hard. But since then I've avoided everything about maths. It was annoying when I got to my history masters degree and we were told we had to do a compulsory essay using statistics. I went to the first lecture and they said 'oh you all got an A in maths didn't you' - to a bunch of people who had primarily taken history so they never had to look at maths again. I got a poor mark for the essay and the marker said 'i hadn't understood the point of the exercise'. To me, there was no point in it, again I did it because I was forced to. I get fed up that so many job adverts ask for 'highly numerate' people even when the job has nothing to do with maths. All employers seem to want are engineers and IT people, both of which are subjects I could never have studied because I'm crap at maths. I think there's a nasty elitist attitude amongst people who are good at maths that, if you don't 'get it', you must be a total retard. Actually, I'm very clever, I have 2 degrees from an exceptional university, but my mind does not work in a way that I would ever be able to enjoy or be good at maths.

If there's riots in the capital city, I imagine it would be fairly sensible to put the Army on standby as they are all riot-trained, and hence there are more riot trained individuals in the Army than in the Police, and moving Police resources around leaves other areas unpoliced for lengthy period of time. Using the Army doesn't have that down side

I doubt highly that the Army will be used, but the government has to tell them to be ready just in case it gets really out of hand (we're talking if the riots keep escalating to the point of tens of thousands, rather than the current hundreds.) since if there suddenly were thousands of rioters, and appropriate numbers of Police couldn't be scrambled without leaving most of London unpoliced, how do you stop the violent minority element in a protest from ruining any part of the city they can reach without having the man power to either stop or deter them from continuing.

Much as people have a right to show they are unhappy with government or the Police, it's a bit of a moral grey area because you have to balance the right of protestors and rioters to their freedom of speech, with the homes and livelyhoods of the people who just want to get on with their lives.

Obviously, we can't have government just clamping down on any protest with even more violence, like we had in the 80's. But equally, we can't allow people to lose jobs or homes because a minority of people attending a protest have turned violent.

It's an area of conflict of rights, to come down fully either way is to basically say one group of individuals is more important than the other; something I feel is not right in our society.
