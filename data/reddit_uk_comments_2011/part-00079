First off, they are completely different players with completely different skill sets and attributes, making comparison almost impossible. Secondly, BAE has, as far as I'm concerned, been one of our more consistent players this season. His linkup with Bale has released Bale along the line countless times and his drags to the middle draw attention from midfield defenders and create space for Modric/Parker/vdV. On a good day I think BAE is undoubtedly essential to the flow of our team. 

EDIT: I forgot to acknowledged that he has definitely made some mistakes this season. But nobody is perfect, and my main point is that BAE's skill has been a 'revelation' this season and the last (in the way sports commentators use the word, like something that was hidden appearing in a dramatic way).

EDIT: Sorry, didn't notice your link.  The NHS pension scheme is in surplus.  It takes in £8bn, and pays out £2.1bn less than that.

It is completely misleading to call it a ""black hole"" as the NHS is more than capable of paying out its pensions from its contributions.  Actually the taxpayer is making money from the whole thing.  Adding the total amount the government will have to pay out in pensions over the next 60 years into one lump sum and calling it a ""black hole"" is like adding together all the council tax you'll have to pay over the next 60 years and calling it a ""black hole"" in your finances.

The principle that people who work in the public sector have made a choice whereby they earn less money with their qualifications than they could in the private sector in return for greater job security and better pensions has been accepted by everyone up to David Cameron.  That's the reality.  The government ultimately benefits from that arrangement, as it means they can pay people less than their experience and qualifications might command in the private sector.

The rhetoric about average public sector wages being higher is a misnomer, as it doesn't look at how qualified the employees are.  That change is more about the contracting out of services like cleaning to private sector companies.

If there's a picket line, you can approach it, and cross it.  Your colleagues there will ask you to stop, and talk to you, and explain their reasons for striking; you can then also explain your reasons for not striking - the most important one being that you're not in a union, and you don't have that pension,but you DO support them.  They'll then let you go in.

The scare stories you hear about violent pickets are media-shite, designed to paint unions in a bad light.  Just reasonably explain!

However, in the unlikely circumstance that there IS violence threatened to you on the picket, remove yourself from the area, and phone work, explain what happened (you approached the picket and were threatened), and state that you do not feel safe at work, therefore you will not be attending until work can guarantee your safety.  However, my above point still sticks; I've yet to see this happen in the last 10-15 years of (admittedly minor) picket lines.

I think he did fine with what he was given. Season 1 just did not have the writing that you see in 3 and beyond. He was great in The Empty Child / The Doctor Dances and I think if he stuck around he could have been even better. However, I don't think Ecclestone really connected to culture of Doctor Who and it showed at times.  I enjoy 10 and 11 more and can tell that both of them openly embraced and really threw themselves into their role as the Doctor.

Predominantly from the black community - who see a white tourist and think they can threaten them for money. Real example from Willesden Green first day in London: big black guy, ""give me a pound"". I give him a pound. ""Give me another pound"". Holy shit, I give him another pound.

I've had black guys threaten me on night buses: ""want to fight?"". I've seen black teenagers threaten individual white women on White City station on a Sunday afternoon. I've had black guys shout at me on the tube. Spit on the pavement as they pass me. Listen to how they talk to each other!

Then I've had white British tell me to ""go back to my own country"" - from BMW drivers trying to cut in on a motorway exit, to a blonde woman on a bus.

I've been told off by full-face-veil women in Shepherds Bush (they are becoming very aggressive, these women, they can say anything they want and they'll never be arrested as a result of a video, as in this case... is that right? Ask yourself that!).

London is *incredibly* racist.

How about this: I expect a certain amount of ""go back to your own country"" - because I *am* a foreigner. This *is* the land of the British. Maybe people here forget they have a country.

What is disgusting is open letters like this. So easy to target one lady secretly filmed on a tram. Personally I think this lady was lucky to survive - because I live in fear of the black community in the UK and I feel they are always looking for any excuse to assault a white guy. But Londoners, the media, the left, all *love* to make an example out of her!

But ask yourselves this: was anyone scared of her? Anyone feel threatened? I think everybody thought she was a bitter nut.

Better a bitter nut than the many more racists in London that want people of different colour to fear them. I think you British are gutless and too scared to address *real racism* in London. Instead you go for the softest targets you can find.

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"&gt; So because you get a bad deal, everyone should?

I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I don't think I have that bad a deal. In fact out of my closest friends I think I'm one of the few who even gets pension contributions from their company. I'm happy to get the additional money even if it's not much. Same way that if I get a couple of hundred quid Christmas bonus I'll be happy, but will have little sympathy for the bankers loosing 40% of their much larger bonuses in tax.

&gt; Why not fight for a decent pension in your own workplace?

I signed the contract, I knew what deal I was getting. As I said I'm not saying I'm upset that my company makes small pension contributions. What I'm saying is that it limits the amount of sympathy I have for people who have much better deals than me.

I'm not saying I have no sympathy. I'm not saying they should be happy they have a job and live with it. I'm not saying they shouldn't strike. I'm just saying that my sympathy is limited.

&gt; I mean, it's ridiculous that we should have to work longer for less, when our technology is ever improving. Surely this should mean we work less and gain more?

Sorry, but improvements in technology are just going to make things worse for people as they become surplus to requirements.

true,chochazel,null,null,"&gt;The public sector is paid for by the private sector by definition... So when the public sector pay tax, they're only giving money back to the government that originally came from the private sector...

No.  That's like saying, ""Tesco only makes money from people who don't work at Tesco!  If someone earns £20000 a year working at Tesco and spends £10000 at Tesco, they're just giving back what Tesco has given them, and Tesco are still £10000 down on the deal!"" NO!  Economics doesn't work like that.  The employee has given their labour to Tesco, which was almost certainly worth more than £20000 to Tesco, otherwise they wouldn't have employed them.  Tesco has given them £10000 worth of goods and services to the employee, which again was probably of greater net worth to the employee.  In total, *£30000* worth of trade has been conducted, *not* £10000, and value has been generated both from the value of the labour to Tesco and the value to the employee of the goods and services.  The value is generated by the useful work the employee does, and the useful goods and services that Tesco produces.  The money just represents that value, so it should be added, not subtracted.  

&gt;So when the public sector pay tax, they're only giving money back to the government that originally came from the private sector...

Money no more ""comes from"" the private sector than it does the public sector.  The public sector mostly gets its money from taxpayers, yes.  But taxpayers get their money from their employers, some of whom are private and some of whom are public sector.  If it's a private sector employer, *where do they get money from?* Usually from their customers, some of whom might be public sector organisations or employees!  Some would be businesses or individuals, in which case they get their money from their customers/employees... Etc.  Keep following the money back and back.  Where do you end up?  Just more and more transactions! Money is just a symbolic representation of wealth.  It simply enables those transactions to take place.  It's printed by the government.  That's where it really comes from.  But that's not what you mean, is it?  To get to the heart of it, you have to think about where wealth comes from when abstracted from money.  That's a bit more vague.  Without money to represent value, what are we left with?  Just a bunch of goods and services which people want.  You sometimes hear people say things like ""the private sector generates all the wealth"".  But there's no logical reason to think that a service provided and paid for in the private sector generates wealth, and suddenly doesn't if it's provided and paid for in the public sector!  Wealth is generated by providing useful goods and services.  Education, for example, is a hugely useful service which is both desired, required, and provides positive value to the rest of the economy.  

It's not where the money ""comes from"", it's how much value you added when the money was moved!  As employees, we take our raw materials (time, physical and mental capacity) and use them to add value for our employers.  This is the point where wealth is generated; the money is just a medium of exchange when we sell that value to our employers.  Businesses take raw materials, labour, space and capital to add value for their customers.  The public sector takes the same raw materials and creates value in the form of safety, health, education, security, etc. for taxpayers.

The public sector is just a great big employer and a great big provider of services.  That doesn't mean it doesn't generate wealth. ",0,1322645166,null,0,true,0,c33ygos,t3_mtooz,t1_c33ygos,t1_c33ycaa,1427950397,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The Sun found out that he was on mobility benefits that helped pay for his car that allowed him to get around. They found this out through following him and invading his privacy to get a story. People don't even remember it now, but at the time his life practically ruined. ""An old man that can break dance on benefits for his bad leg"" it sounds like Kelvin McKenzie's wet dream.

Turns out the reason he started break dancing was that his doctor told him that if he didn't find a way of exercising his leg he would loose total mobility and be forced to use a wheel chair. If they had taken his benefits (which they did temporarily) they would have taken his car, and forced him to stay at home which was a in small village in Leicestershire. He wouldn't have been able to dance again, without relying on family members. He probably would have lost the use of his leg.

From my own experience of the project requirements were poorly understood or thought out, too much money was paid to ""prime contractors"" for doing sweet fa.

Anywhere there is government IT projects there is vast ineptitude. This does not enable the private sector to be efficient.

Equally, tax law - there is thousands of pages of inefficiencies there. A tax system should be simple and easy, ours is neither as the constant debacle and misunderstanding about tax avoidance and tax evasion shows. 

Farming subsidies (mainly through Europe) is another good example of inefficiency in the public sector which leads to waste in the private sector.

true,Islandre,uk,Home Counties,"My problem with the pension cuts really apply specifically to teachers as it is education I know most about. Teachers are already not paid enough money and a pension cut is a pay cut (especially when coupled with the pay freeze). Recent international surveys showed that the countries with the best education systems in the world recruit teachers from the top 0.5% of their graduates and they manage this because teachers are held in high regard, in no small part due to their pay^1 . Every time the government makes an assault on teachers like this they further reduce the standing of teaching as a profession. People always start throwing around phrases like ""lazy"" and ""self-interested"". There has already been a drop in applicants to become teachers this year when we badly need an increase. If our education system is allowed to slip further there will be serious long term impacts on our economy in terms of overall performance and in terms of social inequality^2 .

1. [PISA education survey results](http://www.pisa.oecd.org/dataoecd/11/16/48852721.pdf): Extract: Two school systems show comparatively high levels of spending by educational institutions that prioritise teachers’ salaries over class size (Figure IV.3.7). Both Japan and Korea show above-average performance and below-average socio-economic inequalities. This is consistent with the finding that high levels of investment in higher teachers’ salaries tend to concur with higher performance in education systems (see Chapter 2).

1. Unearthly Child. (First story, first appearance of Doctor, TARDIS, etc)

2. The Daleks (introduction of the Daleks, obviously. Story is also sometimes known as *The Mutants*)

3. Keys of Marinus (Intact example of generic 1960s 6-part story)

4. Tomb of the Cybermen (Intact example of 1960s 4-part story, Example of Troughton story, plus Cybermen as a recurring Monster)

5. Spearhead from Space (Introduction to color and example of a new Doctor transition. Also example of a Pertwee UNIT story)

6. Planet of Spiders (example of non-earthbound Third Doctor story. Example of regeneration story)

7. Genesis of the Daleks (Example of Golden Age Baker story. Example of building Dalek mythos.)

8. Time Flight (Example of 80s Who at its worst. Example of Davison, example of Davison large TARDIS crew dynamic. Example of fanwank.)

9. Vengeance on Varos (Example of 80s Who at its best. Example of strong plot elements, Colin Baker being awesome and very watchable.)

10. Greatest Show in the Galaxy (Example of both strengths and weaknesses of Classic Who in its last years. Example of Mccoy.)

This list would be **way** different if I could have used more than 10 stories. as I envisioned myself teaching a class called Overview of Classic Doctor Who, and **NOT** Intro to Classic Doctor Who, which would have consisted almost entirely of 1960s stories based on the assumption that a student would have further classes in the future to deepen his/her familiarity with the show *or* Classic Who 101 which would have mostly consisted of Tom Baker stories. 

I assume your reason for posing this hypothetical is to get fans to recommend episodes so you can plug yourself into classic Who without having to watch the whole series. It's a good idea, but 10 episodes is nothing, 10 whole stories barely scratch the surface, and you're pretty much going to have to resign yourself to watching 3 stories per Doctor (with Tom Baker I would actually suggest watching at least 4, if not more) which is going to be, conservatively, about 12 episodes *per  Classic Doctor*, around 84 episodes total and about 42 hours of total viewing time to get any kind of real feel for the Classic eras as a whole.",0,1322663060,null,0,true,0,c33zl8p,t3_mupb6,t1_c33zl8p,t3_mupb6,1427950950,19,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,19

Would it sway your opinion about what *I* think when you find out that I agree with Peter Tatchell in this case here, [concerning a homophobic preacher](http://www.petertatchell.net/free_speech/Free-speech-christian-preachers.htm)?

As I've said elsewhere, it's not what she said but rather the way she said it.

&gt; I just disagree.

Yes, I can see that. But you're disagreeing by telling me what I think, even though I made my thoughts clear in the other direction.

&gt; So yes, you do believe people should be punished for expressing an opinion that is different from your own

No, I do not. I said as much in the last comment, and corrected the misconception that I'd given from a poorly worded comment.

&gt;  or at least in a manner you find distasteful 

Oh hang on... *That's completely different isn't it!?*

As I said above, I made the point that ""offence"" is completely subjective and it should not be enshrined in law that someone can be prosecuted for ""causing offence"". However, verbal abuse etc. is a little different to offence.

&gt; in this case expressing it loudly in public while surrounded by ethnic minorities

Quite wrong, actually. To quote The Office: ""Why is it only black people who should be offended [doh!] by racism?"" Even if there were no ethnic minorities around, she could still have been arrested. Even if there are no women around, I will still make a point of enlightening a sexist man. Even if there are no gay people around, you bet your arse I'll give a homophobe a piece of my mind. Politely.

When it comes to an issue like this, it seems many people assume you are all the way over one side, or all the way over on the other. Personally I'm in favour of a restriction on certain methods of manifestation of opinions, rather than restricting those views entirely. This is not an uncommon position for people who have had a think about it.

Consider two racists, in the same public setting as the lady in question such as a tram in Croydon:

&gt; ""Well I am concerned with the level of minorities in the country as it seems that the influx of migrant workers are flooding the job market. I think perhaps it would be better for recent immigrants to return to their homeland to allow the job market to pick up for people who were born here, like school leavers who join the perpetually unemployed.""

&gt; ""Fucking paki scum stealing fucking jobs from us! Sort your own fucking countries out and fuck off back there, you fucking monkeys!""

Both have 'fringe' opinions, but which would you say is libel for prosecution at the moment and, more importantly, *why* is there a difference?

The issue is down to abuse, I think, but there is a notion that only thoughts with regards to race or sexuality are restricted. I don't think there is such a restriction, but rather the abuse that occurs to other groups/individuals is not as widespread or common so does not receive much attention.

true,chochazel,null,null,"Public Sector Pension Liabilities is just the sum total of all the money the government will pay out in pensions for the next 60 years or so added together!  
That doesn't really tell you anything about how sustainable they are, because it doesn't take into account the Pension contributions that will be taken in to pay for it!  You are talking about Pension schemes that often operate at a surplus!

It's like adding together all the Council Tax you are due to pay for the next 60 years into one lump sum and calling it a £60000 black hole at the heart of your finances, even though you'll earn a continuous income over that period which will easily cover it.

Elsewhere in the thread you talked about the NHS pension liabilities, and described it as a ""Black Hole"" even though the NHS brings in £8bn in pension contributions and only pays out £5.9bn in pension payments!  Far from being a black hole, the taxpayer is making money out of nurses and doctors pension contributions!  

The £1,133bn figure is completely abstract, because it calculates the investment the government would need to make now to pay for those pensions in a hypothetical scenario.  But the government won't do this!  They'll use future pension contributions to pay for it, like they always do!  
If you'd read the report yourself, you'd see that the OBR admit this, saying:

""this increase had nothing to do with changes in the size of prospective pension payments. Instead, it reflected a fall in the discount rate used to convert these future payments into a one-off sum. The discount rate is linked to the real yield on high-quality corporate bonds, which fell over the year""

http://www.professionalpensions.com//digital_assets/3220/FSR2011.pdf

In other words, if, for some bizarre reason, the government were to pay all the pensions of every public sector in one go, the amount they'd have to spend to do it has just gone up because of a fall in corporate bond yields.  Queue the rabid headlines about the ballooning costs of Public Sector Pensions!  Later on in the report they point out the gross cost of pension payments is due to fall from 2% of GDP to 1.4%.

It's hardly completely different is it?  The manner that people are able to express themselves isn't necessarily easily changed, you are basically advocating the silencing of stupid people through the threat of state backed physical force.

I don't see what your opinion on a homophobic preacher has to do with this, you're still wanting punishment for somebody expressing an opinion you dislike.  I believe a case can be made for prosecuting *calls to action* against people (e.g. 'Sinners must be killed and gays are sinners') but I am against preventing people from expressing opinions, you are for it.  You may not be *completely* for it, but you *are* for it in certain circumstances.

As an aside, here's the funny thing, the tram lady *didn't* say 'paki scum' or 'monkeys' she said in a rather simplified and uneducated manner what you said in the first paragraph.  The worst thing she said was 'fucking Polish' and suggesting that someone isn't British because they are black, which while rather vile is hardly worth arresting someone over.

&gt;but which would you say is libel for prosecution at the moment

We are not discussing what is currently libel for prosecution, we are discussing whether or not it should be.

Why is there a difference?  How many undereducated, low wealth/income people do you know that would be *capable* of expressing themselves as you did in the first paragraph?

true,chochazel,null,null,"&gt;One of the main points of Hutton's report was to ease the public sector pension deficit and make the pension plans sustainable

1) You are still confusing two different terms.  Pension liabilities say nothing about whether there's a deficit in payments or not. 

2) If the costs were due to fall as a share of GDP anyway, that's clearly sustainable!

3) Public Sector pensions have already been reformed in 2006, hence why costs are now set to fall!

4) Part of the 2006 reforms was the introduction of Cap and share, which means that even if there were future costs, they would be met with increased employee contributions!

5) The government's said that increases in contributions will go straight to the treasury for short-term deficit reduction, *not* to pension funds, the whole thing has nothing to do with ""public sector pension deficits"".

6) Overall the governments got more in Pension contributions than they've ever paid out.

Given that pensions have already been reformed, costs are set to fall anyway, even if there were rises, they will be paid for by employees not tax-payers, and current increases are basically being treated as a tax, when you and the government use the word ""shift"", you're using in extremely euphamistically in the sense of, ""it's not a pay cut, I'm just shifting the cost of employing you from our customers to you.""

&gt;And as has already been pointed out elsewhere in this thread, the government are not earning a continuous stream of revenue during this period, and are, in fact, increasing borrowing....

Pension liabilities have nothing to do with the deficit, so it's still a silly point to bring up.  Pension liabilities would be the same if the government had a budget surplus - it tells you nothing about the state of the budget as a whole, or of the individual pension schemes. Oh and taking money from pensions to pay massive debts... Robert Maxwell anyone?

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"Actually, Harold Wilson wanted to severely curb the Trade Unions in 1974. The resulting report (headed by Barbara Castle I believe) was pretty much the blueprint the Conservatives used in the 1980s.

Of course Wilson couldn't do it, because the Unions wouldn't allow him to.

There was good reason for the Unions to have much of their power rescinded. It was abused wholesale by many of the more militant Unions, and by the late 70s was making Britain almost ungovernable. Much of what the Conservatives did was nowhere near as 'diabolical' as militants and sentimentalists like to portray.

They ended secondary picketing. They enforced the ballot. They ended the compulsory closed-shop. They made Unions responsible for reparations due to *illegal* strikes. There are exceedingly good reasons for these restraints.

Britons are still entitled to Union membership. You cannot be sacked for being a member of a Union. An individual can choose a Union rather than having one foisted on them. An individual can decline membership of a Union that does not represent that person's interests or which actively works against them. And Unions can no longer threaten members with lifetime unemployment by removing their Union membership.

Many Unions were corrupt. Many employed violence and intimidation.Which is why, as individuals, we should be cautious of any political group having too much power. Individually or collectively.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; you are basically advocating the silencing of stupid people through the threat of state backed physical force

Who said anything about stupid people? You're implying that I think people who disagree with me in a violent/abusive way are unintelligent - I think that says far more about what you think of me, than I do of anyone I might disagree with. 

Why don't you ask me questions rather than continue to make implications that I have gone on to deny and explained why?

&gt; I don't see what your opinion on a homophobic preacher has to do with this, you're still wanting punishment for somebody expressing an opinion you dislike.

Well, it's relevant because I do not agree with the preacher at all, but do not think he should be silenced or prosecuted. This would be an example of something the exact opposite of that of which you are accusing me. Note the example I gave at the end of my last comment.

But I have had a thought:
Unless of course you are speaking *specifically* about this case and this case only? I've been arguing against the point I assumed you were making, which was what you thought I was saying: 1) What this lady said is wrong *and therefore* 2) She should be punished.

Again I'll refute that: 1) I think the opinions this lady expressed are misguided/wrong *but also* 2) She should be reprimanded for the way in which she expressed those views.

*The way* she said it, not expressly *what* (the sentiments) she said.

&gt;  but I am against preventing people from expressing opinions, you are for it.

OK at this point I'm going to ask you to read WHAT I say, not what you THINK I say. Otherwise I'm going to have to conclude that you just get off on contradicting people and telling them what they think even though they've expressed the exact opposite.

&gt; I hate you, because you're a fucking black.

&gt; I tend not to like people of African origin - they are generally disagreeable.

Same opinion, different way of expressing it. One can be deemed abusive, one is not. Both are, to my mind, disagreeable, but the general sentiment is not something I am arguing should be silenced. ""Sticks and stones"" etc. but of course words do hold some power.

Can I ask: Do you think racial slurs should be acceptable for use in public? i.e. Nigger, paki, wog etc.?

&gt; here's the funny thing

Yes I know, but she expressed her opinions in an abusive way directly because of someone's race. I used a more extreme example to make things clear. At least that is what I attempted to do.

&gt; we are discussing whether or not it should be

Which is why I then said ""... and *why*..."": I was making the point that one type of manifestation of opinion is deemed acceptable and why another isn't.

&gt; How many undereducated, low wealth/income people do you know that would be capable of expressing themselves as you did in the first paragraph?

Are the nuances so hard to extract? I chose extreme examples to make my thoughts clear.    
But incidentally I have heard educated and wealthy people express similar sentiments as my 2nd example, minus the ""fucking"" etc.

I'll rewrite it so as to steer you away from thinking I think the uneducated should be punished:

&gt; ""All these damn foreigners flooding into England. Never bringing anything but their bloody fuzzywuzzy singing and bongobongo dancing. They bring all the little nignogs with them and take all the jobs.""

The point I have been continually making is that of abuse: It is possible to express yourself without being abusive. That is of course subjective, with the state recognising historical racist epithets, for example, and swear words. As it happens, I don't really agree that swearing can always be deemed to be abuse - intent is often more important than language, when it comes to ""shit"" instead of ""poo"" for example. I'm sure you'll have fun with that...

But I disagree that a huge number of people are *unable* to express themselves without resorting to abuse or epithets, but even if they can't that doesn't mean it should be tolerated in public when directed towards individuals (or groups). How many people *really* couldn't find a non-racial slur word for ""someone of Pakistani origin"" instead of ""Paki"" for example? (Yes, I *know* the woman didn't say that here).

The woman in this case said something along the lines of: ""You ain't British, you're fucking black."" Would I be wrong in concluding that is an aggressively racist statement?

If it makes you feel any better, I do understand where you're coming from, but I don't agree that punishing someone for expressing themselves using particular language is limiting freedom of speech.

Show me exactly where the quoted legislation requires offending speech to marginalise a particular group. All the law requires is that hate speech ""may incite violence or prejudicial action against or by a protected individual or group"".

Understand, *anything* which may incite violence falls afoul of this law. Dressing like Hasidic Jew and standing outside a Mosque is a ""display"" which ""may incite violence"". Should that behaviour be prosecuted as hate speech? It clearly, unarguably, falls neatly into the definition provided.

Interestingly enough, wearing a Man United top in Liverpool city centre on a Saturday night is a ""display"" which ""may incite violence"", but would probably not be prosecutable, because football fans are unlikely to constitute  a ""protected group"", although the law does allow ample scope for a judge to rule that they are.

true,chochazel,null,null,"&gt;[1] http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11466273 &lt;- regarding the pensions payments / contributions gap.

As I already said: 

1) overall, more has been paid in than taken out

2) That growth looks like the result of rising costs on that graph.  Actually, those costs come from inflation.  In real terms, they are not increasing.  Normally pension contributions would rise as well, but pay has been frozen, so in real terms, public sector workers have had a massive pay cut.  The reality is that they are now being punished because their pension contributions from their reduced wages no longer cover pension costs!  So pension contributions go up as wages fall!  It's a double blow, even though in the long run, that pay freeze will make pensions more affordable, and in the long run, the schemes are in surplus.

3) As I said, the rises are not even going in to deal with the shortfall anyway - they go straight to the treasury, so your graph is irrelevant to this discussion.

4) Cap and share has already been agreed upon to meet any deficit.  So your graph is doubly irrelevant to this discussion.

5) Beyond that, the gap is the result of armed forces pensions which have no employee contributions, in return for risking life and limb.  That's a cost of national defence which should not be subsidised by other public sector workers alone.

6) The NHS scheme is in surplus but still have the increase.

&gt;If, over and above the pensions issue, the government is spending more money than it takes in, then the public spending is not sustainable. 

That's not true in and of itself.  Cyclical deficits are sustainable.  Small structural deficits are sustainable so long as they are less than the increase in inflation added to the GDP.  Debt is sustainable so long as borrowing costs remain low and there is a prospect that it can paid off in the long term.

Regardless of whether the current deficit is sustainable, pensions are a long term commitment.  People agree to take part of their salary as deferred payment towards a pension.  That's a perfectly prudent and sensible choice for them to make, and they may have invested a great amount of time and money in training on the understanding that they will get a good pension.  You may start paying in in your 20s and still be drawing in your 80s.  It is perfectly appropriate to look at their costs over extended periods of time in the context of 60 or 70 years.  It is not reasonable to change the terms every time there's a short term deficit problem!  That's a massive breach of trust and smacks of Maxwell, it really does. It's irrational and immoral to use pensions to solve short term budget problems anyway.  The tiny amounts we're talking over the next few years won't touch the deficit.  Over a 45 year career, though, it amounts to huge amounts of money.  Who today would want the terms of their pensions determined as a way to pay for a recession in 1965?!?  Think about it.

I would hope that Geofferic was, in his example, lambasting people who listen to or propogate Dubstep rather than people who simply ""like"" it. If it was the latter then it's not a wonderful example for him to use because it is not something that people would automatically know about someone, nor is it a historical example.

To be brutally blunt, our old crop of players were better than our new generation. Torres has become Shev2.0, we need to cut our losses on him and move on. If we're going to play anyone simply for their price tag let it be Lukaku.


Romeu should be played more and not just in cup games. From what I've seen he is a similar mold to Pirlo. Probably just the player we need.


David Luiz is a struggle. I like the guy but he is prone to Bramble. Though same can be said with most recently. Maybe it's a management problem. Hire in a good defensive coach. Or fuck it, bring in Zola as co-assistant.

Is it inevitable that people by tabloid papers, is that what the collective *we* genuinely want? I don't think so, and it is certainly not a good thing.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"Personal debt can eat away at that significantly. Lots of people have it. If they have for example 20K of personal debt (not unusual) then the interest on that will be around 3K.

If you then look at the increased mortgage debt people have in the south compared to Scotland/North, or overspending taken out against the mortgage, then that too can account for a great deal. Assuming an extra 60K on mortgage at 4% then it's around a further £2,500 a year.

That 5.5K of extra debt interest is probably the difference between a new car every few years and a few holidays, and living day to day and scraping by.

Believe me that it's not just how much you earn, it's how you spend it and how self controlled you are.

I also wonder if the having priorities from the article is being misunderstood. I think it needs to be taken quite literally rather than as a euphemism. 
&gt;""You need to have priorities to live off £40,000,"" 

If you don't have the priorities then you'll probably do just fine, until the debt creeps up on you and you end up barely scraping by. If on the other hand you set priorities then you can have a very comfortable life indeed.

So now I'm thinking fair play to her.  If she's got the money and isn't whining about being broke then she can spend it however she likes.  At least she's living within her means.  

Then I got confused because a little later on it said:

I drink rarely, maybe 3-4 times a year.  I do go out to pubs or restaurants, but only a few times a month these days.  Usually my friends come over to my place for the evening or I'll go to one of theirs and I usually do this at least once a week.

Shopping with a list and sticking to it I can definitely see helping - I always end up spending way more than expected and pick up a lot of things because I just saw it and fancied it at the time.

Taking lunch to work would also help and I was doing that in the summer (I noticed the cost difference very quickly!), but in the winter it's nice to go grab something hot from the restaurant at work.  It is subsidised, so a fairly decent meal is between £3-£4.  I don't think that's bad really.  I do need to stop drinking diet coke!  Usually I'll have 2 a day at 65p each - doesn't sound like much but when when you add it up over the month it would be nearly a week's diesel money.

The other thing I've been meaning to tackle (again!!) - and plan to in the new year, is smoking.  That would save me a decent amount of money straight away, 3 pouches a week is a shade over £20.

My economics is sketchy at best. Surely, however, in the right hands, an investment of 500% is not unreachable?

Technically photons don't exist in time or space. An excited particle over THERE loses a bit of energy, and a particle over HERE gains a bit of energy. The time delay between this happens at the speed of light, so we say the photon is traveling at the speed of light. However, anything traveling at the speed of light undergoes infinite time dilation (and an infinite increase in mass - though that's not a problem for a mass-less particle).  Infinite time dilation means that zero time passes for the particle, even as time passes everywhere else. And if there is no time, velocity is impossible, and thus distance is impossible (not just zero, but divide-by-zero). From the relativistic perspective of an imaginary photon, there is no distance between where it was emitted and where it was absorbed. To a photon, every point in the universe is exactly on top of every other point, and there's no time or space between them. Everything in the universe is interacting with everything else it can see, all at once, all the time.

Yet we say that light photons are traveling around everywhere all the time and that's what lets us 'see.' And that they can be traveling for billions of years ...

I dreamed about Davros and the Doctor. Two men were going to leave the people of a devastated city to die. Pan 360 around a destroyed building. Shattered windows and decadent surroundings.

The computer looks like a program that has flat holographic gray rectangles float about and manifest themselves in RL. They have a plus sign on each indicating the option to add a person. They can digitally “capture” a persona and store the data. Davros would use this to save everyone but the two men blackmail Davros and the Doctor (10) is doing his usual “WOT?!”.

Davros mentions Shan. The two men make mock Davros about Shan. Davros is leaning to the left over the counter of our house between the tv and dining room which is also my school hallway (dreams are weird). His chair adjacent the counter facing the kitchen.

Toulouse has two central midfielders with a lot of potential in Moussa Sissoko and Etienne Capoue that Comolli has been following since he was at Tottenham and one or both might be worth snapping up in January if possible.

Also I hear Eccleston had problems with people who ran the show and that's why he didn't come back. I think his darker angry Doctor didn't fit the tone RTD was going for- if he was going for silly adventure.

But the ninth's personality is one I prefer over ten's. It fit better with his relationship to Rose than ten's. He was more subtle, and whenever he got happy about something, it was that kind of smile that was like a little kid at Christmas. He smiles and it lights up the whole room.

As far as The Girl Who Waited and The God Complex goes, I can't specifically remember anything that really tied into the last two episodes (Closing Time, The Wedding of River Song) without some spoilers. They used some light foreshadowing that would almost be pointless to mention... Neither one lead into the next episode very much. 
The Girl Who Waited was mostly based on Rory and Amy... with Rory making a very big decision concerning her (I don't want to say more for fear that you don't already know the basic plot).  The God Complex is also sort of it's own separate entity, touching lightly on what's to come. For instance, the Doctor opens a door and says something to the effect of ""I knew it would be you"", although it never really showed what/who was behind that door. Again, I don't want to divulge more information on why he opened that door, fearing you don't know the basic storyline.  So really, I feel that you could go into Closing Time and The Wedding of River Song without seeing the previous two, and not really get lost at all.

If you feel like it matters maybe go for smart casual? E.g. go for chinos instead of jeans and shirt instead of t-shirt.* But remember this is only for your personal confidence, not for the interviewers' sake. They won't dress up for you, so don't worry :)

The interview certainly won't be formulaic. It'll an in-depth intellectual chat, emphatically NOT a series of questions to which you have to supply the answer robotically. Don't hurl back answers like you've nailed that one and want to move on.
