Actually, you were downvoted for [insulting the intelligence of anybody who disagreed with you](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/ibk6b/torchwood_request/).

I agree that discussion of Torchwood episodes and arcs should be kept to r/TheHub and I'm no fan of ""hey look, here's a thing with 'Torchwood' written on it"" posts, just as I'm no fan of ""lulz, I seen me a statue"" posts. However, I think posts asking whether Torchwood is worth watching and information on when the new series will air are relevant to this subreddit. I didn't know about r/TheHub until you mentioned it a week ago so I wouldn't have known about Miracle Day if it hadn't been mentioned here, and people aren't going to get an unbiased opinion if the ask the Torchwood subreddit if they should watch Torchwood. Obviously that's completely subjective and obviously your opinion differs from mine.

Now the objective version: Including the one that you deleted, there have been eight Torchwood-related posts in the past seven days. If you scroll back through /new you've got to go back twelve pages to reach the first of those. That's 287 posts at the time that I'm writing this (25 posts per page for 11 pages, then twelve posts into page twelve) with only eight of them about Torchwood, and a quarter of those were posted by you. At significantly less than 3% of the total output of r/DoctorWho in the last week, that is in no way enough to see anything else ""thrown to the bottom"".

If you exclude the one which also featured Rory and note that two were both asking the same question (whether Torchwood is worth watching) then really, that's six. If you note that another of them was a repost of something posted previously (an 11-minute preview video) then you're talking about five *different* Torchwood posts in the past week, and you posted 40% of them. You've also posted about Torchwood in another thread ([Enough is Enough](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/iad22/enough_is_enough/c226ke2)) that I know of and may have done so elsewhere, so assuming that you don't spend your time watching the Torchwood videos or reading the articles, then the biggest reason for your time to be taken up by Torchwood in r/DoctorWho is simply because you keep bloody well talking about Torchwood in r/DoctorWho.",0,1309943597,null,0,false,0,c23wmff,t3_ihscl,t1_c23wmff,t1_c23vfnj,1427319587,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

This is my mail to the Co-op (please don't copy it word for word, even if it does apply to you exactly, personalised emails will have a far greater impact):

&gt; Dear Sirs,
&gt; 
&gt; I have been a Co-operative banking customer for well over
a decade and until now I have been entirely happy with your service.
I choose to bank with the Co-operative almost entirely because of
their ethical stance and it is to this end I feel the need to write to
you today.  I was incredibly surprised and upset to read yesterday
that your company has every intention of continuing to advertise with
the News of the World despite allegations, amongst others, that they
hacked into and tampered with the voicemail of a murdered child.
&gt; 
&gt; It is easy for a company to _claim_ to be ethical, but it is much more
difficult to actually _be_ ethical.  I would think this case is pretty
clear cut: spending large sums of money with a newspaper that by its
own admission regularly breaks the law (phone hacking and police
'payments' being amongst the already admitted transgressions) is not,
by any stretch of anyone's imagination, ""ethical"".
&gt; 
&gt; I implore you to cease associating your so-called ethical company with
the News of the World.  If you do not, not only will you almost
certainly be named and shamed (as is happening already), but I will
close my bank accounts and cease to do business with the Co-operative
in any capacity.
&gt; 
&gt; I look forward to your response.

And whoever they talked about would be in the paper a few weeks later accused of having an affair or seeing prostitutes or whatever they could find and/or whatever they could set up.

They almost succeeded.. it was fading away until the child kidnappings information started a shitstorm. Don't forget the government had some interest in putting this to rest as well because of the Andy Coulson affair. Coulson who was a, if not the conservative campaign manager and Cameron's strategist and aide used to work for newscorp.

Dramatic allegations of criminality were made against James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks during a House of Commons debate on the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World.

Tom Watson, a Labour MP, used parliamentary privilege to accuse Mr Murdoch, who heads News Corpâs European operations, of perverting the course of justice with the substantial payments he authorised âwithout board approvalâ to âsilenceâ victims of phone hacking.

The dramatic claims followed a concession earlier on Wednesday from David Cameron, who backed calls for a public inquiry into the hacking affair.

The prime minister promised an inquiry which would take a look at media practices, with aides confirming that it could look at regulation of the sector â including the operation of the Press Complaints Commission.

Mr Cameron also said there should be another inquiry into the original police investigation by the Metropolitan Police of the News of the World hacking cases.

In a rowdy prime ministerâs questions, Mr Cameron refused to endorse calls by Ed Miliband, Labour leader, for the resignation of Ms Brooks, News Internationalâs chief executive. Ms Brooks was editor of the Sunday tabloid in 2002, when the mobile phone of Milly Dowler, the murdered teenager, was allegedly hacked.

UK phone hacking scandal
News International Newspaper logos on wall

The phone hacking scandal at the News of the World is threatening to engulf the paper, as it faces allegations that criminal investigations were compromised.

In his first public comments since the allegations were made, Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp, parent company of the News of the World, defended Ms Brooks and said the company was co-operating with the police.

âRecent allegations of phone-hacking and making payments to police with respect to the News of the World are deplorable and unacceptable. I have made clear that our company must fully and proactively co-operate with the police in all investigations and that is exactly what News International has been doing and will continue to do under Rebekah Brooksâ leadership,â he said in a statement.

Mr Cameron also resisted calls from Mr Miliband that the government defer a final decision on whether to allow News Corp to bid for full control of BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster.

Mr Miliband said the issue could at this late stage be referred to the Competition Commission to allow a âbreathing spaceâ while the hacking allegations were investigated.

But Jeremy Hunt, culture secretary, is expected to clear the bid on Friday and Mr Cameron said any deviation from âdue processâ could end up with the government being subject to a judicial review.

BSkyB shares fell during the debate to as low as 818p, still higher than the News Corp offer price of 700p a share. News Corp shares fell almost 4 per cent in New York trading, outpacing a small decline of the S&amp;P 500.

Meanwhile, growing public anger on social media websites like Facebook and Twitter was forcing advertisers to review their relationship with the News International title.

The Co-operative Group, which on Tuesday said it would be âirresponsibleâ to consider a ban on advertising in the paper, on Wednesday reversed that decision.

The retail and financial services group said it had taken the decision to suspend temporarily any further advertising and promotional activity with the News of the World until the outcome of the investigation is known.

Lloyds Banking Group said its Halifax subsidiary had cancelled an advertisement in this Sundayâs News of the World, while Sir Richard Bransonâs Virgin Holidays said it was withdrawing a limited number of classified advertisements planned for this Sundayâs paper. Santander, the Spanish banking group, said it would not be advertising with the tabloid in the near future.",0,1309977077,null,0,false,0,c23zcbs,t3_iibep,t1_c23zcbs,t3_iibep,1427320882,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

The two can't be compared.

The war split the country so if we're castrating media organisations for supporting the war, we'd also need to do the same to the public who supported it too. Also, take into accounts that we do not know anywhere near the full story as much will be kept locked away.

This is something I'm pretty sure everybody is against. It's not a debate, it's a crucifixion. 

Also, take into account that even after an illegal war, some good can come of it. There is nothing good that can be taken from this.

As a nation, all top earners of business need to put some of their earnings into more employment. This would then allow people like you and me to afford to live in Britain and at the cost of their extra 3 porches or 4 million savings.

On a less bitter note and more helpful advice from someone who has had experience in your position in the last 6 months.

- posting stuff like this everywhere is a good idea. 

- a job isnt just going to ring you up, you need to be looking on all and every job site you can think of and find.

- people who are employed have no idea how hard it is for us to get a job right now, so dont take what they say to heart (as I have done a couple of times) just see through their ignorance.

- think positive

- be genuinely nice to all and everyone you meet. 

- reddit.com/r/ukforhire - worth a shot

- be positive

- if you are applying to basic work don't do what I have done and put down you have a degree. Make sure you put down work that is relevent to what you are applying to. I have also found that when it states 'last 2 employers' I should have just lied to make the application fit better.

- don't lie, but don't tell the absolute truth

- think and be positive. (I fell into the biggest rages, and negative thoughts and dreams whilst unemployed, you have to try your hardest to stay away from this!

Having said all this I still only have a job which is 16 hours a week and can barely afford to eat after bills, rent and car maintenance ect. (need my car to keep my job)

The Tory get-elected machine will pander to various interests as a transaction to get those various interests to pander to them. That includes News International, Mumsnet, the BBC, every single newspaper, companies, pressure groups, charities, etc etc. It also includes the public.

There is not a single bit of difference between what the Tories do and every other political party of note. 

Al of those interests have leverage over each of the parties, the amount of leverage varies. The Daily Mail for example may be more likely to get UKIP and the Tories to side with it. The Guardian would be more likely to get the LibDems and Labour with it. It's less clear with other interest groups. 

Getting elected these days is all about pleasing as many of the people as you can in order to get them to speak about you in the best light you can. Labour pandered to News International too - don't you remember Labour party folks screaming betrayal by The Sun?

Your view of things is a naive unfounded conspiracy theory that's quite plausible if you have a schoolboys mind and mindlessly consume what the various lazy forms of media spew at you.

The Tories will want to keep Murdoch happy. Murdoch will be blackmailing the Tories into keeping him happy, but it's a balancing act.

I've just had the most interesting conversation with my GF regarding this which kinda blew my mind ( she a tabloid journalist and has been for 20 years, not for Murdoch I'll add and no, she's not involved, she actually has morals  ) basically if they run an inquiry all sorts of shit is going to surface and implicate all sorts of people in all sorts of different ways, chances are they won't though ( or not a proper one anyway ) because even the politicians and the police to a certain extent ( they take pay-offs for leads) knew that these methods of underhand investigative journalism were standard practise and have been since the tabloids began in this country.

Basically everyone denying that they knew about this is talking utter crap, they're covering their own backs. The general public are ( including myself ) completely naive as to what went on here and that's what we're upset about, it's a world we know little or nothing about. Put it this way when one particular tabloid noticed that this was getting on top, they had an intern shredding evidence for weeks. 

But if you actually take a step back and look at it, it's so bloody obvious, it's how they get their stories, I mean they don't just pop up out of thin air. Now I'm not saying that this is not sickening for those involved who've had their lives disrupted, it is.

She's definitely from Gallifrey. Whether or not that automatically makes her a time lord is an open question - we saw in Classic Who at least two groups that rejected Time Lord society.

She could have died in the Time War - certainly the Dalek occupation of Earth and its aftermath would present an obvious target for Time Lord strikes. She could also have gone back to Gallifrey offscreen (there are even those who speculate that she was the unnamed time lady in *The End of Time*).

There's no reason to assume she was involved in the Time War - I can certainly see the Doctor deliberately avoiding mention of her to keep her from being targeted by his (numerous) enemies.

Now, while 10 claimed that he would have sensed any other Time Lords, it's worth pointing out that the Doctor has never been particularly strong psionically - Susan was much stronger, the Ood were much stronger, most of the prophets and such he's encountered were also stronger.

&gt;In The Curse of Fenric (1989), the Seventh Doctor states that he does not know if he has any family, which may indicate uncertainty of Susan's whereabouts. In 2005's ""The End of the World"" the Ninth Doctor states that his home world has been destroyed and that he is the last of the Time Lords. Although Susan is not mentioned by name, the Doctor says in ""Father's Day"" that his ""whole family"" died, and in ""The Empty Child"" a character remarks he has been a father and grandfather, but no more, and the Ninth Doctor replies ""I know the feeling."" In ""The Age of Steel"", Mrs Moore asks the Doctor if he has any family, to which he replies ""Who needs family? I've got the whole world on my shoulders."" In ""Fear Her,"" the Tenth Doctor states he ""was a dad once,"" but does not elaborate further. In ""The Doctor's Daughter"" the Tenth Doctor says that he had ""been a father before"" and is still hurt by their deaths. In ""The Sound of Drums"", the Tenth Doctor discusses with the Master the fact that they each chose their own names. In Susan's case, it is unknown where hers comes from. In ""The Beast Below"", Amy asks the Eleventh Doctor if he has any kids. The Doctor does not reply, but the question clearly makes him very uncomfortable. In ""A Good Man Goes to War"", Amy asks again if the Doctor has children, to which he replies 'No'. When Amy rephrases the question and asks if he ever had any children, the Doctor quickly changes the subject, again looking very uncomfortable.",0,1310003288,null,0,false,0,c241z7w,t3_iimbs,t1_c241z7w,t3_iimbs,1427322110,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

So we  exist in the fourth dimension. We have grasp of the first three dimensions; however, we merely follow the ""current"" of the fourth dimension. The TARDIS travels through time through the time vortex. If we [assume](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_vortex_(Doctor_Who\)) that it is a temporal wormhole it explains how the TARDIS travels. Since Time Lords are exposed to the Untempered Schism, I'll take a gander that they are able to see the entirety of time due to this exposure. The vortex is supposedly existing outside of spacetime (the fourth dimension) and possibly in the fifth. The fifth dimension, if I am understanding the above correctly, would allow you to travel between worlds (those that are similar to our own). So it is not necessarily that they perceive more dimensions than us, but that they have a connection to the Time Vortex which is connected to all points in Space and Time.

In terms of the who fixed vs. changeable. I think that a fixed point in time is one that would cause a drastic change in our reality. Examples being: Pompeii, Hitler, [Adelaide's death](/spoiler). Other events will also change the future, but it is not a massive shift.

That doesn't mean you have to agree with all these agendas, and there are very nasty, cheap and downright scurrilous ways of promoting them, but you're very wrong to imply that having one is bad.

Yes, newspapers are meant to be impartial, yada, yada, yada - it's not going to happen, not while the people working on the papers have their own opinions, aspirations and ambitions.  

I steer clear of many papers because I don't support their agenda of isolating the public from genuine issues by feeding them 'easy reader' sensationalism and gossip, but I'll sure as hell read the credible ones (i.e. the ones which don't plaster the latest tales of Ryan 'I really don't give a fuck who you diddled' Giggs on the front) to attempt to get a balanced view.

Don't fall into the trap of thinking that having a political opinion or agenda always means someone has inappropriate motives, or you'll just end up being as whiny and miserable as 'outraged from doncaster'.

It's not the best description of what they are doing - after all, they're writing about their proprietor. Other sources describe it better.

&gt; The Guardian doesn't pay any tax on profits because it doesn't make a profit. GMG does and does.

That's a very poor excuse. The Guardian is effectively subsidised by the money GMG makes. GMG is a rabid tax avoider. So The Guardian is assisted by tax avoidance, a practice they downplay when they talk about themselves but go on the attack when it is anyoen else.

&gt; Even if there is an issue with the situation outlined in that article, at least they bring it out in the open

In a blog article, hidden away - much like being printed in small text on the back page, as I said. If it was a front page story (and it may well have been, I don't read the Guardian) then they should get major respect for it. I doubt it was.

I actually don't care about tax avoidance - it's up to the government to close loopholes, and companies to exploit them.

My only advice when it comes to renting accommodation is to stay away from MTM housing, I rented with them last year and didn't have a great experience.
With regards to travel, if you're going to be using the bus a lot you can buy weekly bus passes, at the UoB shop they are Â£10 for the week so im guessing they are similar at UoSussex, if not then I think the usual price from local shops is about Â£15.
I like to use the megabus to get around the UK, not great for time or comfort but if you are on a budget its ideal, they run from Victoria (London) and if you book in advance both the train to london and the coach ticket are very cheap, I got to Cardiff from Brighton for Â£9.
I am going into my 3rd year and have paid between Â£70-Â£80 per week for a double room in a house each year. There are toward the lower end of the price range it seems.

She had an imaginary friend who rocked her world for 20 minutes and then disappeared for 12 years.

This became so unsettling to her parents that she went through 4 psychologists, and you can hear heartfelt anger and sadness when she says ""why did you say 5 minutes?"".

true,stop___grammar_time,tardis,TARDIS,"Alright, armchair psychology time, AKA me over-thinking stuff. Also, a wall of text, because I tend to ramble.

&gt;make every situation really slutty

Let's look at the character, Amy Pond. Little Amelia is uprooted from her home in Scotland to live in Leadworth, a little rural hamlet apparently in the middle of nowhere, England. Presumably, this happens maybe 1-2 years prior to her meeting the Doctor, judging by her accent. What I mean by this, is she obviously spent the years she learned to speak and firmly engrain that way of speaking in Scotland somewhere, living there at the very least until age 5-6 (when we meet little Amelia, she's 7). 

At some time before meeting the Doctor and after moving to Leadworth, the Crack appears, and begins devouring bits of time and history. We know that's why Amy doesn't know about big events of the new series (Canary wharf, giant cyberman in Victorian London were mentioned). We also know that it erased Amy's parents. They're just *gone* for some reason. Hell, it could have erased a lot of other stuff too. Maybe Leadworth was a bustling city before and the Ponds moved there for some economic reason. I digress though.

Little Amy lives in that too-big house, just her and her Aunt. Then the Doctor shows up. One strange night, a weird man wearing raggedy clothes shows up, does a lot of crazy stuff, and disappears, the only trace he leaves is her blown-up back garden. Then, we don't hear anything about the 12-year interim, after which 19-year old adult Amy, a huge departure from the demure 7 year old we were introduced to.

Now we're past stuff we already know, I begin to speculate. Let's look at Aunt Shannon, the woman who raised Amy. She doesn't seem like a very good parent, leaving a seven year old by herself all night. When we finally meet Aunt Shannon in *The Big Bang* she seems maybe in her 30s. She looks sort of businessy in her pantsuit and jewelry. Maybe that's what keeps her busy, she has a career that was just sidetracked by having a niece to raise just showing up. More evidence that she's maybe not that great a parent is given later that episode when she decides to leave her 7-year-old niece behind in a museum presumably far away from Leadworth (remember the little exchange between Amy and the Doc about Leadworth being far away from airports and stuff? That city that the museum is in is probably nowhere near Leadworth). Nice parenting, Aunt Shannon. Also, Aunt Shannon sounds like kind of a bitch. What's wrong with kids having imaginary friends? So what she imagines stars in the sky. What's wrong with little kids, little 7 year old kids having imaginary games? She sent Amelia to **4** psychiatrists over her being a *7-year-old who likes to use her imagination*. 

Amelia grows up. Aunt Shannon supports her, puts her through school, feeds her, etc., but is still sort of distant. Amy doesn't really have a strong parental figure and she grows up, rebelling, acting out to get attention. Maybe she gets into a bit of trouble (she does know how to pick a lock in *The Beast Below*. That's not usually a skill you pick up growing up as a goody goody.) She grows up to be attractive, and learns to use it to her advantage. She becomes a ""kissogram."" She show up to parties and things and ""kisses people"" for money. She's the center of attention. 

What's keeping her in Leadworth? She's a wild young thing, out of school, with a job that isn't really a career. Why doesn't she pack up and head out to the city? She loves Rory. Rory's the only thing that keeps her in this little village. Of all her contemporaries, the children of Leadworth that she grew up with and went their ways, she went with average, dependable, Rory Williams, even over attractive but boring Jeff.

Why Rory? Rory's been her partner in crime ever since she was seven and the mysterious man showed up. He's the only one who at least went along with her game of ""the raggedy doctor,"" even going so far as to dress up as Amy's imaginary friend.  Maybe she only realized this shortly before the Doctor showed up again in her life, judging by the way she introduces Rory as ""just a friend"" to the Doctor. Maybe it's because she's a bit flustered that this man she had as an imaginary friend that maybe she sort of had a crush on just showed up in real life. She stays there for Rory. Maybe even helps out with his nursing school bills with her kissogram money. Who knows?

The Doctor showing up again, in the flesh, apparently just as he had left her 12 years ago, only strengthens her relationship with Rory. Here's this fellow whom she grew up with, that she might have blown off at one point, just being a boring dude from Leadworth. However, she realizes that growing up, she never really *knew* the ""raggedy"" Doctor. He became this imaginary personality, this ideal man in her head. She forced Rory to dress up as him, molding him and influencing him to act as this imaginary ideal man. Rory in turn picked up on this, and over the years acquired traits more in line with this personality, and by the events of *The Eleventh Hour*, he has become pretty much perfect for Amy. The Doctor showing up just cements Amy and Rory's relationship because she realizes that she doesn't really know the Doctor. He's charismatic and funny, yes, and a lot of the things her imaginary perfect man is, but he's still pretty much a stranger that in total she's probably only spent two or three hours with.

Rory's the one she grew up with, the one who's actually more like her ideal than the actual person she based the ideal on. The two years post prisoner zero only cements that, leading to their engagement and planned nuptuals. 

This is interrupted, of course, by the Doc showing up and whisking Amy off for however many adventures before *Vampires of Venice*. Rory's intimidated at first. Not only is this the guy who burst out of his stag night cake in lieu of the expected stripper and told him he just kissed his fiancee, he's also the guy whom Amy based her perfect guy upon. He soon realizes that he himself is more like Amy's ideal (which is why they're getting married), Amy has realized that as well, and that the Doc is absolutely not interested in her that way. Rory and the Doc become cool with each other, realizing they have quite a bit in common (maybe because Rory turned out like an ideal personality based on the Doc).

Back to Amy: 

All the adventures prior to Big Bang she's Rebellious Amy. Raised by her Aunt, acting out, etc. She's kind of wild. Then, the Big Bang 2.0 happens. Time has been rewritten. Her neglectful aunt didn't raise her, she had two wonderful supportive parents. She didn't go to four psychologists, she had a normal imaginary friend and grew out of that phase. The crack never happened, so the events of Prisoner Zero didn't happen and she's had a pretty much normal tame life up to now. 

However, Amy Pond is a complicated event in time an space due to her travels with the Doctor. She has both the memories of her life prior to the Big Bang 2.0, she has memories of her new life. The mind of a milder Amy Pond, perhaps, recessive but co-existing to the wild Amy that grew up with the crack. This, and her new married life, is why I believe the Amy in series 6 isn't sexin' it up all over the place like she was in series 5.

&gt;Rape is rape, that's all there is to it. Its sex that isn't consensual. 

And the age of consent is 16. Sex before that is therefore rape, although it might not be charged as such. If you agree with it not being then you agree with the original principle that some forms of rape are not as serious as others.

&gt;Would you say some murder was less serious than one other? 

Of course I would, and the law agrees. That's why people charged with the same crime can get wildly different sentences.

Date rape? I'd class that at the higher end of the scale. He did go on to say he had that term confused and meant under-age but willing people having sex. How true that is I have no idea, but shifting focus to that is moving away from the initial point, and the very fact you are trying not to answer the question before shifting the 'less serious' one away from something that is clearly less serious to something that is only slightly less than extreme cases makes me think you agree in principle that some rapes are more serious than others and are just obfusticating the point to save face.",0,1310104561,null,0,true,0,c24bbmo,t3_ij42m,t1_c24bbmo,t1_c249az9,1427326650,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"I guess the key part of a bribe that makes it different from a regular sale of services or information is the corruption.  The police are expressly prohibited from accepting any payment or gifts, so knowingly taking money in exchange for information or to influence an enquiry is a clear cut case of bribery.

Similarly, public officials (e.g. MPs) have a duty to uphold the democratic constitution under which they were elected (i.e. representing the electorate fairly and equally, and not taking back-handers to do otherwise).  Politicians, for example, have to declare any payments, gifts, or services they receive in the Members' Register of Interests.  If they do then it's above board and legal, if they don't then it's corrupt, illegal and could leave them open to bribery charges.  So if you're a politician you can take money to pass laws as long as you're open about it.  Then it's not bribery, it's called ""lobbying"" or ""political party donations"".  Stupid, I know.

On the other hand, if a journalist goes to a private detective and pays him for information, then it's not bribery, just a regular sale of services/information.  The private detective doesn't have any obligation *not* to accept money for services/information so they're not really acting in a corrupt way.  Immoral perhaps, and maybe even illegal, but they're just doing their shitty little job and never made any promises (unlike police and MPs) to be honest.

After the events of the episode that Amy realizes how much she loves Rory and she would not give it up. Really, you can probably say that there are plenty of episodes where one or the other says or does something that reconfirms their feelings for each other.

It's interesting that people seem to have this kind of feeling of Amy being ""slutty"" but have no problem with Rose. I assume that Rose had a normal relationship with Mickey until the Doctor came along. After she started travelling with the Doctor, Mickey was basically thrown to the wayside. I cannot say too much more since those details are vague. But I know that you can see the jealousy between Rose and Sarah Jane during *School Reunion*, but it bothers me her attitude when Mickey asked to tag along. I believe others have remarked that even though Rose gets to stay with meta-crisis Doctor that it still was not satisfied.

Now don't get me wrong, Rory is a great character by himself, but I think that one reason I like Rory is that his being there helps to get rid of some of the sexual tension.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Y'all become quite desensitized to emotionally charged events.

Strictly speaking, they are ""emotional rollercoasters"" when they *work*. As is, they don't for anyone who's remained critical throughout the series (Rose wants The Doctor *all to herself*, oh no how sad).

Now, emotion is a wonderful thing, and I do think that, when it's *earned*, it should be explored. *The Office* (UK) is brilliant at this. So are shows like *Extras*, *The Wire*, *Treme*, *Sherlock* and the Steven Moffat episodes of *Doctor Who*. *Doctor Who* works when it's subtle and the changes are small strokes in a huge canvas of change.

Characters in previous eras would declare how they feel, for example, in between bouts of weeping. Whereas in Moffat's era, Rory thinks Amy is referring to the Doctor as her future rescuer, for instance (""Day of the Moon""), and everything he feels is shown on his face. This becomes especially effective when he *doesn't give up the chase anyways*, doubly effective when it turns out it was Rory Amy was referring to in the first place.

But Rose crying on Bad Wolf Bay is a tad bit melodramatic. The general rule is that you have to ""tone it down"" for TV - we can't show how people really react in real life or else everything would take forever (imagine having to depict PTSD). While I admire Billie Piper's acting, I do think that throwing in an ""I love you"", a crying Doctor *staring into space, shocked"", a pregnancy (where did that come from and where did it disappear to *later*?) and a ten minute monologue from Rose was a *tad bit too much*. Not to mention that her entry into the other world didn't make sense anyway (how did Peter know she was flying, where to land and *when*?). It's just frustrating and sad, like watching some nice band or kid you know trying to be something they're really, *really* not.

Russell T Davies focused too much on things he should have subtly worked in. *Nobody* makes a grandiose speech the way his characters do. I think the only time this worked was Ten declaring he'd been ""showing off"" to Martha, and I do suspect this happened because of Richard Clark's direction (for reference, he directed ""The Doctor's Wife"" this year).

Dear Prime Minister,

  This is the first time I have contacted the office of the Prime
Minister, yet I now feel it is imperative that I make my voice heard.

  The recent hacking scandal is a shameful episode, yet even more
shameful is the apparent corruption in the Metropolitan Police Force,
uncomfortably close ties between government ministers and members of the press, and general bungling that the whole episode has unearthed.

  It's now clear to me, as one sympathetic to many Tory ideas, that your claim that ""everybody at News International should take responsibility"" is wholly inadequate. Further, I fully believe that you, as an experienced government minister, know that this claim is disingenuous; in government the buck stops with the requisite Cabinet Minister --- why should business be any different?  Are we really to believe that, in your view, mid-level functionaries at News International should shoulder the same blame as Murdoch, Brooks, Coulson et al, should they be incriminated?

  Further, I believe that this episode has brought to light grave
deficiencies in the laws and regulations that govern media ownership in
the United Kingdom. Murdoch, an Australian by birth, is a naturalised
American citizen.  He is an American citizen because in the United
States, by law, only Americans may own television news media.  It is
clear to all and sundry that the British tabloid press is every bit as
influential as American television news.  In this light, can anybody
explain why it is the case that, in the United Kingdom, we allow
individuals who do not even have the right to vote in elections in this
country such influence over our democratic processes?  What do you
propose to remedy this deficiency?

  Perhaps the most troubling aspect of this scandal, however, is the
apparent corruption, both in Government and the Metropolitan Police,
that has been brought to light.  Late last year it was revealed that
both Government Ministers and members of the Royal Family had their
phone voice-mail accounts hacked into.  This, on first blush, appeared
to be a blatant affront to the national security of the  United Kingdom,
yet both the police and your administration seemed content to identify
low-level scapegoats, imprison them, and continue the investigations no further.  Were you ever under the impression that the phone hacking saga was limited to just a few individuals in government?  If not, why was the investigation not pushed further?  I can only come to the conclusion that it was not pushed further due to the uncomfortably close alliances between government ministers (of all parties) and News International. On the other hand, if you were under the impression that the phone hacking was limited to a few individuals,  do you now accept that you were hopelessly naive in your estimation of the scale and depravity of News International's operation?

  It is only now, with yet more revelations that News International
newspapers had been hacking into accounts en masse, that we see how
misguided and inept this initial police investigation was.  It has now
been revealed that News International paid up to Â£100,000 in bribes to
the Metropolitan Police for information that should have been
classified.  A bribes account this large is not signed off by individual
journalists, but clearly indicates a wider corporate policy, one which
incriminates Brooks et al, of bribery.  Further, how far did this
bribery go?  Was it working to the benefit of both parties, in a quid
pro quo style agreement?  Was the tabloid press releasing ""leaks"" on
behalf of the police in order to influence investigations?  Was the
police using the tabloid press to circumvent judicial overview of their
wire tapping?

  I would be much obliged if you, or one of your staff, could summarise
precisely what is being done to address:

        * Our apparently deficient media ownership laws.
        
        * Inquire as to why the initial Metropolitan Police
        investigation into the hacking saga was so ineffective.
        
        * Identify whether Murdoch is a ""fit and proper"" person for the
        purposes of media ownership laws independent of his non-British
        status, in light of his attempt to gain control of BSkyB.
        
        * Identify whether Brooks or Murdoch are incriminated.
        
        * Identify and eliminate the apparent ""business relationship""
        between the police and press.
        
        * Identify how members of your party will begin to distance
        themselves from media barons so as to remain impartial and
        uncompromised as government ministers.

Many thanks for your time.

Sincerely,
Dr. XXX",0,1310116490,null,0,false,0,c24c1ay,t3_ijuzd,t1_c24c1ay,t3_ijuzd,1427326986,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

And the club today  insisted the dual  option study into the  possibility of  redeveloping Anfield  - as well as looking at  plans for a new  stadium -  is ongoing.

Could this be the week we finally turn the tide on Rupert Murdoch? Pressure to weaken his grip on our media and our democracy is building. Let's work together to get the clean-up operation started.

Disgust at the behaviour of Murdoch's newspapers has pushed politicians to start speaking out. [1] But we need to make sure our MPs follow through with real action. If MPs start hearing directly from thousands of their voters, we can push them to finally stand up to Murdoch.

It only takes 2 minutes to email your MP. Click to get started:

https://secure.38degrees.org.uk/Murdoch-MP

For far too long, MPs have been scared of Rupert Murdoch. Now they need to be brave. If they have the guts, there are three things they can do immediately to stop the rot in the UK media:

1. Stop Murdoch taking control of BSkyB [2]

2. Start a Public Inquiry, led by an independent judge, right now [3]

3. Start an investigation by media regulator Ofcom into whether Murdoch is a ""fit and proper"" media owner [4]

Yesterday, we finally heard some MPs admit to the way Murdoch calls the shots over our democracy. ""We've fallen for threats"", they said, and ""we were not courageous enough"", ""we've colluded for too long"". [4] That's a start, but now they need to act to match their words. Together we can push them to overcome their fear of the Murdoch press and listen to their voters.

Tell your MP it's time to be brave and stand up to Murdoch:

https://secure.38degrees.org.uk/Murdoch-MP

Time and again, as 38 Degrees members work together to campaign for a fairer, greener, more democratic Britain, we come up against the might of Murdoch. Whether itâs protecting our health service or our environment, or getting real action to tackle the excesses of bankers, too often his papers do all they can to get in the way.

Murdoch's papers have behaved appallingly. But some good could still come of it. This could be our chance to finally level the playing field and get politicians answering to voters, not media barons â let's work together to seize it!

Of your three points the first one is a wrong one - You want to ban foreigners owning media in the UK? Are you fucking nuts? That'd be done by communists and fascists.

How far up the Met/Government - essentially you're asking for an enquiry,... which we are already going to get.

Is Murdoch a fit... again the enquiry will turn that out.

Now is NOT the time for this. You need to keep hold of your anger until the right time. Right now every right thinking person in the UK is outraged and wants to see something done. But it's also in fashion, so all the dumbfucks, knee jerk reactionaries and all the rest of people are also in on that act. 

It will all fade away in a few weeks, it'll come back out a little when the enquiry comes out, but that is the time at which our anger is best placed. Do not prejudge the outcome of the enquiry, wait until it has happened. 

I'd also question your motives here because of two sentences in your original post that I think reveals you to be trying to make political capital rather than just doing the right thing. You say ""The Conservatives are vulnerable. Cameron's linked to Brooks and NI."" I think that shows you are taking the opportunity to have a go at a political party you don't like.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Of your three points the first one is a wrong one - You want to ban foreigners owning media in the UK? Are you fucking nuts? That'd be done by communists and fascists.

I don't see how this is nuts.  The media has a profound influence, probably the single most profound influence, being told, on the outcome of our elections.  It's obvious that tabloid newspapers hold enormous sway in who becomes leader of this country, and clearly politicians know this, hence their ingratiation with NI.  In this respect, ownership of newspapers is not like owning a car or electronics manufacturer.  Why *should* somebody who cannot even vote in this country hold such an enormous amount of influence over our politicians?  

Further, restrictions of this sort are not a fringe idea.  [Overseas investors are restricted in their investments in UK defence companies, for instance](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:aggfQNIzVI8J:www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/25726BCE-8DD6-4273-BE8D-6960738BEE0A/0/polpaper5_defence_industrial.pdf+defence+industrial+policy+uk&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=it&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjpD3oCsfAgyk_XSvLkDDLnqLFbasAuvdIiiz-odXhrtDDQxu7YpS1K83eQTOJH0AUJ4sWkiQdCwffl2VuQcu02LLxYoMMnQqfnxB_mQjnb7MURHefNEZcH1VfEOCVNmY-1y7pn&amp;sig=AHIEtbSPUCiYjlSwr2o22dP7GS5JVRhJ2A&amp;pli=1), specifically out of national security concerns.  Both the US and Australia, each bastions of simultaneous communism, fascism and whatever -ism you can think of, also place tight restrictions on who can own media companies, and how much they can own.  As pointed out, Murdoch is a naturalised US citizen for this very reason.

&gt; ""The Conservatives are vulnerable. Cameron's linked to Brooks and NI."" 

Err, no.  The comment, when read in its proper context, instead of being taken out of said context and hence losing all meaning, meant that writing to your MP/the PM will likely have a profound effect, therefore any excuses about writing to politicians being futile are invalid.

&gt; I think that shows you are taking the opportunity to have a go at a political party you don't like.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"Indeed. Energy companies should stop trying to make it look like they're benevolent public services and come clean that they're profit generating businesses, and they have a duty to their shareholders to maximise profits.

They can maximise profits by having a sustainable business model, being honest and competing fiercely. The governments role is to regulate the market to remove barriers and increase competition.

The Daily Mash had a quite insightful article about mobile phone companies needing more money - ""MOBILE phone operators have confirmed they will need more money to achieve their sole aim of bringing the whole world together."".

If they're honest with us about providing goods and services for a profit then we can judge them on their merits, rather than being dishonest with us and claiming to be there for the good of Britain, and then us having a go at them when they aren't.

I think the problem is with the regulation. Utility companies should be made to send out a clear English A5 statement insert which clearly states that energy bills are going to go up by x% for gas and x% for electricity, and that the particular customer will be affected now or when their fixed tariff ends on xxx. That way people will be promoted to shop around.

The government needs to also make sure that barriers to exit aren't there - yesterday an elderly neighbour was complaining that he was going to be charged Â£80 for a new meter to change supplier. I've not looked into it yet on his behalf, but if that's true then the government needs to regulate that away.

They didn't really flirt, there were never any sex jokes, any awkward moments when she falls on him and presses her boobs against him and he's super embarassed - none of the standard stuff you see in tv romance nowadays, especially for a slightly more kids themed show which usually loves the awkward sterotyped romance.

&gt; For one, many people share computers that were paid for by other people, either with family members, at school, at a community center, or a library.

I really hope you aren't using a torrent at any of those last 3 places. so they're are moot towards the benefits of a torrent.

If you share a computer with family members your family is still spending a lot more than $13/year on internet. so my point holds that there is disposable income.

&gt; And I've been using someone else's internet for years now, since I stopped being able to afford it myself.

If you are leeching someone else's internet from home then it's very bad of you to be torrenting large files.  I find this an unacceptable excuse for piracy.

If you are going over to someone's house to torrent large files then I think you have disposable time to go try and earn more money to afford $13/year.

The problem with being able to get these things so easily for free is that it hurts our approach on the market in general.  It makes you stop evaluating what is actually worth your money.  If you have to choose between a coffee a week and Doctor Who then you are removing any motivation to be able to afford both because you can steal one of them.

Okay, so...pandorica/tardis explosion resets universe. Cracks in universe healed themselves and never existed, which is why amy's parents are still alive, implying they fell through the crack. Rory also instantly never fell through the crack, because he never left earth or went near said cracks...they say in the episode that since the doctor is on the wrong side of the ""crack"" that he won't be reset with the rest of the universe.

HOWEVER the Doctor has been going on about how if you remember something its never really gone the whole season. When his life basically ""flashes before his eyes"" he goes on and tells amy to remember a bunch etc etc.
We know that even if someone falls through the crack and gets erased, they're not totally gone for someone who's been exposed to time travel, hence amy's constant unexplainable crying, fascination with the ring, the doctors ability to remember, etc, and her remembering of rory, and River Song's being well, River Song and her jarring of Amy's memory. Essentially though the crack almost totally erases someone, there's some residual memory at the back of the mind.

So just like when rory fell through the crack, amy never totally forgot. Her remembering of the Doctor essentially called him back into existence. Amy and Rory never lived through the explosion because to they never experienced an explosion. THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE WAS RESET, meaning that they were born, lived and got married without ever technically meeting the doctor. 

Think of it like a parallel universe if that's easier. 

Rory is human because up until they remember Doc for some unexplained, probably never fully explainable reason, Doc didn't exist until he was remembered.

If Rory was still an Auton then I would be disappointed in him. His hand is a weapon, and he never uses it to save/protect his wife? As remarked, the fact that he is able to procreate suggests there is something other than cold, hard plastic under that Centurion armour of his. There are several other remarks that also show that Rory is no longer an Auton.

&gt; Following the Doctor's success in saving the universe and preventing the cracks in time, the real Rory was returned to a rebooted, new universe. Despite this, Rory retained memories of experiences as an Auton after Amy remembered the Doctor back into the universe from the other side of the cracks. Rory married Amy and was given the nickname of ""Mr Pond"" by the Doctor as he was under Amy's thumb.

This would not explain the mid-season 6. I think that ""A Good Man Goes to War"" points that the baby is real. Also the flesh need to be connected to a living being.

true,Turil,k9,K-9,"Talking in reality very much.  In fact, speaking from personal experience.  Sharing is the only way to live, it's the way evolution produced human culture, in fact, and it's how all the rest of nature functions.  Exchanging without quantifying.  Offering what you want to offer, and being compensated by the world when what you offer is valuable.

But I know this is too different from what many people have been taught, and so I'm not surprised when people reject it at first.

As for (healthy) food and condoms, yes, those clearly fall into the socially beneficial category, for which it behooves us all to help everyone get, if they need it.  Those who make such things are compensated for them in a variety of different ways, as I mentioned, based on what they are (in this case a physically limited resource) and the possible distribution networks.  Food is already free to those who understand nature and their bodies.  Almost no individuals on the planet have to pay for food except some humans.  All other species and even many humans know how to grow/harvest their own food in nature.  Junk ""food"" and otherwise low quality ""food"" obviously isn't socially beneficial, and will naturally have to cost more, since it costs society to both produce it and for you to use it.

I realize, again, that this isn't obvious to you right away.  It takes some getting used to, since we've been so brainwashed by the idea of being dependent on money, quantification, hording, and competition that it takes some work to get to the reality of physics...

His problem is with bullshit tabloids that do these things as part of yellow journalism and then hide behind those arguments that he sees as essentially sound; basically, ""Yes, it would be an attack on the freedom of the press, but you're not the press.

I want to add that this can be a problematic argument, especially with regards to drawing the line between the public good and the public interest and what behaviour should be tolerated for what ends, but in this case and as an informal commentator with no bearing on legal precedent I think he's on pretty safe ground in telling them to go fuck themselves because seriously.

Your basic ideal is socialism, fine.  But you aren't going to convert everything into a socialist environment, you have to lose what exists and build something new, but instead you steal from the old.

If anything Doctor Who in the UK is socialist as it's payed for by a tv tax even if you don't watch it.  However distribution in the US costs money, as well they can rely on British tax dollars less with foreign revenue.  Maybe you should move to the UK where it is treated as a social good?

To be fair, it's easy for Milly to make a stand against Murdoch because he's got nothing to lose.  He's not in Murdoch's pocket, he's not in power, and quite possibly won't ever be.  

We all know that Murdoch famously abandoned the labour party and had the Tories join his ship for the last election.  We all know that Cameron is bezzy mates with Brooks and various other influential members of the Chipping Norton Set.  He has egg on his face and I hope it's just a matter of time until he is forced to resign.  It's not that I particularly dislike him (no more so than any other politician) or think he's any more corrupt than previous politicians who got into bed with Murdoch.

Murdoch's backing of the Tories in the last election seemed to just be following the wind, and it still couldn't win them a majority.

I think that this is just a trend that has started with nobody really knowing which came first, the politician pushing for media attention and publicity, or the media pushing the politician into a more media friendly position.

Pro-social things have always been made and offered to the world, long before artificial linear monetary systems were invented, and will continue to be around long after the concept of money becomes extinct.

&gt; I have no idea nor anything to go on to make such an assessment. 

Then why are you making claims about what I can and can't afford, if you have nothing to go on.  Do you realize that you're being totally irrational then, if you don't even bother to collect any actual information to use in your thinking process?

&gt; All I know is that if you have a computer and the internet to pirate a tv show you care so much about then you probably can afford $13/year for it.

Yes, but in many cases, that ""probably"" isn't the case.  In my case, I'm not in the middle of the bell curve.  I'm at the bottom end.  Not including the grants I've gotten for my program (which go to the program itself, and can't be spent on stuff for only myself) I've been paid just a little over $100 for my work so far this year.  I get all the things I need to survive without money.  Gifts from either other people who support my work, or nature.  I give the world what I create, and the world reciprocates, without the messy middleman of money, or the waste of time of quantifying things.  

Knowing that this kind of non-linear economy is not only possible, but is the way reality naturally works, due to the laws of physics.  The artificial, linear approach, which many humans have tried to use, just makes life harder, as it literally goes against physics.

true,Ashiro,cnty-england,England,"It's actually quite the opposite. If you look at the list of Lords you'll find a huge array of expertise that far outshines that of Parliament. Contrary to popular opinion it isn't filled with ancient, crusty aristocrats who go fox hunting every weekend.

The Lords is actually very diverse and I'd argue they're better placed to debate many issues than the Commons. Take a recent debate regarding a diplomatic incident over Gibraltar. It actually became a running joke during the debate as the number of people with intimate knowledge of the crisis increased with every standing Lord. You had former ambassadors to Spain, former Gibraltan diplomats, EU advisors, etc.

I'm still undecided on whether I support an elected second chamber as I think an appointed chamber does have some benefits. As appointments - although often political - have also favoured merit. An MP gets into the Commons by being a good talker and slick liar with the ability to convince a constituency of people. A Lord gets into the House of Lords by being a successful diplomat, businessman, veteran or some other meritous position.

By becoming a wholly elected chamber you can be hit by two problems: 1. If elections happen at the same time as the Commons election you will end up with a rubber stamping chamber as it will be mostly made up of the most popular party at the time. 2. If the elections are held mid-term you will likely end up with an opposition controlled chamber which will (now its elected) put party politics well above the common good and work to hinder the current government. I believe this is currently happening in the US with a Republican controlled Congress blocking everything the Democratic Executive puts forward regarding taxing the rich.

Just because a body is elected does not necessarily make it good. It may be much more democratic but that doesn't necessarily translate to a well run country. Now that doesn't mean I think we should have a dictatorship. I'm just saying that the Lords, being appointed doesn't fall foul of the petty party politics that the Commons does. It makes for a much better forum for debating.

By becoming wholly elected I think it will lose a lot and gain very little other than a wooly feeling of: 'Its more democratic'.

I'd like to remind you that the US has one of the most democratic systems in the world with elections at just about every level from police commisioners to its 2 chambers and the president. And yet the US implemented some horribly draconian measures such as the Patriot Act. The internment of Japanese during WW2. The Macarthy with hunts. These were all carried out by a democracy with a powerful set of checks and balances. With a fully written constitution and even a bill of rights.

I was living near Chelsea when they were rebuilding Stamford Bridge, and they had years of disruption and reduced capacity, and still ended up with a ground that was too small. It doesn't make sense to go down that route: I think a brand new stadium is the way forward, built while we can still have full capacity crowds at Anfield.

I don't think we'll lose too much history in the move - it's not like it's the original Spion Kop that's there anyway. Liverpool fans and Scousers in general are always accused of living in the past, but I want to see us move into a new stadium with genuine character. Not one of these boring identikit ovals like the Emirates or City of Manchester - something unique.

One of the designs that Statler and Waldorf showed off for a new stadium really excited me - a [lop-sided stadium](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_eosGkndaIFM/SMfGzZDp5YI/AAAAAAAAD98/Nl-IGnpsZWc/s1600-h/lfcNewAnfieldWP.jpg) dominated by a gigantic stand at the home end. Something like that, with appropriate acoustic engineering and allocation of the right tickets to the noisiest fans, could be made as imposing as the Kop of old.

I think the possibility of a move is a huge opportunity.

In fact, I'd also be open to (whisper it) a shared stadium with the loveable neighbours, provided it didn't entail a compromise in terms of seat numbers or an interesting design. I don't know if Everton would want to pay for half a of a stadium that's too big for them, but it does make financial sense for us to share the costs. A shared stadium could be built that changed character depending on who's playing at home - the colour could be changeable like the [Allianz arena](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Allianzarenacombo.jpg), the stands could have different names (Spion Kop one week, whatever they want the next) and you could even have separate naming rights - ""Standard Chartered Stadium at Stanley Park"" versus ""Chang Arena at Stanley Park"".

They were running from the crack in space and time...
and they were distracted...

 - 1.2GHz 64-bit Celeron/Atom (unsure if its single or dual, likely dual)
 - Pre-installed OS/Distro of your choice (including VMWare vSphere)
 - 1TB storage
 - 2GB RAM

 - 100MBit dedicated line
 - 5TB/mo traffic (exceeding this results in the line dropping to 10MBit unless you order extra traffic)

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, I like that the episode leaves questions like that unanswered. But to satisfy your curiosity I will hypothesize on his origins. Warning though, this is just a hypothesis and by no means is it right.

Now, as to his origins. He states that he came from before time, and before the universe. Seeing as we have no other answer to this question, we will go with that. But, I hear you asking, how did he come from before time? Very good question!

 See, it is possible that our universe isn't the first one. Maybe, at one point in 'time' there was another one, yet unlike our own it had a very different set of rules. Time, as we know it, may not have existed in this universe 1.0, instead there may have been something completely different in place that governed something kinda sorta like time, but not really (pro tip, stop trying to wrap your head around it, you can't. No one can.)

Now, if he came from universe 1.0 how did he get here? Well if we assume that universe 1.0 expanded like our own is, we can also hypothesize that it could retract. If we go off of this assumption then the answer is rather obvious. Universe 1.0 kept retracting, getting ever smaller, until the big bang happened resulting in our universe. Now, of course, this still doesn't truly explain how he got here. But lets just imagine that as the universe shrinks all other races die out, all but the strongest. One of these we will call ""God"" the other will be our friend ""Satan"".

Now, if you know your bible you know that ""God"" and ""Satan"" were bro's at one point. Until Satan fucked shit up, and god with his epic ego, cast him out of heaven. We can imagine that heaven is a sort of bomb shelter, where these pre-universe beings stayed to be safe and after the big bang, god cast satan out of it. 

So, here we have a brand new universe. All ready we have two omnipotent beings hanging out, along with their friends (assuming angels and demons exist as well). Now god is seen as good, and going off of the way that satan acted in these episodes we know that satan is in fact bad. So, in order to preserve this wonderful new universe, god chained up the devil around a black hole. Also, going off of this, it is safe to say that god is hanging out somewhere where he can't fuck up this universe.

Well this is all fine and dandy isn't it? But it doesn't explain how every race knew of the devil right? Ah well that is the easy part. You have an omnipotent being that transcends time and space. Is it hard to imagine that this creature would have some sort of psychic influence? There he is, like a evil sun, casting his dark rays into every mind ever all across the universe. Is that really hard to imagine? He probably gets off on it, more than likely does it on purpose. 

Oh, and as to your last question: Why doesn't he escape? Well he can't obviously. God wouldn't make it that easy, the chains are probably unbreakable, and even if he did break them, the planet would fall into the black hole. And no, god wouldn't just kill him. Remember, god is the good guy.

Any other questions?

Because if you have the ability to torrent and watch it you have the ability to pay $13/yr for it. :)  Maybe someone nice lets you borrow their internet maybe someone gave you a laptop to use.  Those people could also share $13 with you.  You may not think anyone should have to pay for it, but that's not the world we live in.

If you manage to steal your internet and are using a library/public computer to download illegal files, then you are simply being disrespectful and jeopardizing those who tried to help you otherwise.  I guess in that case you'd be fine with stealing a bootleg copy from someone as an alternative to not using a computer?

You avoided my question from before by the way.  ""How do you think the show would ever get made if everyone torrented it?""

&gt; I give the world what I create, and the world reciprocates, without the messy middleman of money, or the waste of time of quantifying things.

In this case the world doesn't reciprocate, you steal from it.  The BBC nor Steven Moffat have said ""Hey feel free to not compensate us for our work at all!""
&gt; The artificial, linear approach, which many humans have tried to use, just makes life harder, as it literally goes against physics. 

Nothing can go against physics.  Physics is the laws of the universe, everything can and must fit within the laws of physics.

It looks like this season is going to tie back into the old show by the inclusion of 4 characters, repeated references to the 4-5-6, and by centering the whole immortality thing around captain jack.
