* Hobgoblin (was pretty empty when I was there around 9pm last Friday so should be plenty of space
* That one on Magdalen roundabout which I can't recall the name of right now
* Wetherspoons (the posh one near primark?)
* Gloucester Arms (loud, maybe too small depending on how many people come)
* Far From the Madding Crowd
* The Chequers (not been here since the meetup last year - can't remember if it was expensive)

true,ktpa2,flair2,,"Can't really decide between Parker and VDV, so I'll throw out some reasons for the pair and decide at the end.

Parker has been unbelievably consistent over October. Shut Arteta out against the Arse to kick off the month and has been moving from strength to strength. QPR yesterday - he was making tackles by our corner flag, then 2 minutes later winning the ball in the final third. The guy has a phenomenal work rate, seems like he genuinely cares for the team and never really comes up short at the end of 90 minutes.

Rafa, however, has scored 6 goals in 5 games. Goals are the commodity of football and he's often cropped up at important times to get us moving. The crucial first goal against the Arse, kept a cool head for the penalty against Newcastle, gave us the cushion we needed against Blackburn when they were looking dangerous and set us on the way nice and early against the R's. Now he's back in the team every week, I can't see why him and Ade shouldn't start every match. Sure, Defoe is in a rich vein of form, but if nothing is broken... Don't fix it. Give him half an hour as an impact sub with Lennon and reap the rewards that way.

true,emericuh,lfcflame,,"I turn 32 next month and I came to the scary conclusion Saturday that I'll probably never see another Liverpool player who is older than me. Carra is about a year older than I am and Gerrard is about 6 months younger. Maybe Bellamy will stay fit and play another 10 years? :D

I am optimistic, for the most part. This isnt the best team I've seen, but it's far from the worst, either. I'm not as sold on some of the youth as others, but only because I grew up about a mile from where Gerrard did and even at 13 there was no question about how special of a player he was. I don't get that feeling from any of our players now, apart from Suarez who is simply amazing. I think Henderson will be a critical part if the team for a long time. Carroll had a fair game this weekend, but he drifted in and out a bit too much for me to fall in love just yet. 

The big difference I see this season, though, is that we seem to be playing without much ego. We don't take teams for granted like we did last season and the whole club seems to get on with each other. The only thing I see lacking is the killer instinct that top teams have, but I'm hoping that success will breed more of that.

You might have students who have very good grades on paper, but when you meet them they have all the desire, passion or charisma one would expect from a sack of potatoes, or there may well be students who don't have the top end qualifications on paper, but when you speak to them they have an overwhelming desire to work hard and a passion for for course that just doesn't fully express itself on paper. 

So, just like you couldn't ever hire someone for a job without an interview, you can't run a university course application process without interviews. So I would very much consider an interview to form part of the basis for admission to a decent university.

true,Moistcabbage,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;For example, state school students achieve more firsts at Oxbridge when compared to private students of similar school achievement. Therefore it is entirely sensible to discriminate against private school students when evaluating school achievement - doing so will result in more students capable of getting 1sts 

You're suggesting they turn away students who are capable of getting firsts? How are they supposed to predict those private schooled students who won't achieve firsts despite suitable previous achievments? I've had this discussion with my postgrad peers who are now admissions tutors and they admit prediction is diffcult to impossible.

The reason state schooled students are awared more firsts is that only the very gifted are given enough support to apply to Oxbridge. Conversely Private schooled students with a variety of abilities are given the same support. Consequently the few state schooled students gain 1sts whereas the many private schooled students gain a wider variety of grades. This creates a correlation/causation problem in that most state schooled students do gain firsts, but not simply because they are state schooled. You appear to have made this mistake with your argument. Discriminating in favour of state schooled students won't dramatically increase the number of firsts being awarded, it will increase the number of sub-first degrees being awarded to a larger intake of state schooled students.

The interest rates are very reasonable, and they wait for you to be earning a certain amount before you start paying it back.

I was (un)lucky in that I was the first year to have to pay government tuition fees, but also lucky in that the earning threshold was fairly high.

it's around £15,000 now - so if you're earning that, they take a contribution from each month's wage packet. Again - this is for those staying in the UK. I've no idea how it might work for you.

Liverpool's a beautiful city though, for sure. The people are mostly fine - either too busy or self-absorbed to perhaps not say hello to you, but still peaceable enough to not insist you give them your wallet. ;)

There *are* some fairly delapidated, and run-down areas fairly close to the city-centre (within a couple of miles), and there's a kinda omnipresent homeless population (true of any big town or city, i guess..)  

do your research though! :) find out as early as possible if it's even practical for you.

It would allow us to ease off the consistent evaluations of children as they grow up, and would remove that pressure of 'you must get A B or C to get in' during exam times.

The rest of the article has an air of 'no shit sherlock' to it however. I would go a step further however; I think students should initially state they are interested in particular courses at particular universities through UCAS. When they have finished their exams, their results are given to the Universities they have expressed interests in and the Universities contact the students they want. After results are published, students may still apply for other Universities.

Given the final say is with the Universities irrespective of approach, this will mean not a real lot changes in terms of who gets in and whatnot, but it eases up the system a bit. The whole spiel about needing to judge talents before offering a place is, in my opinion, bullshit; let's be frank, in no way do the Universities or UCAS provide any useful information about any applicants other than their grades and any statements from teachers. They would need to meet face to face and they could sort that out too.

The majority of comments seem to focus on the headline of private schools having some kind of advantage; can't say I believe that in this case, just another case of public schooling failing and needing to be improved if it holds to be true.

* lost revenue in DVD sales by the BBC themselves (which do help keep the license fee relatively low), and some of the independent producers of their programmes who rely on sales to be able to operate successfully

Nope.

&gt;I've had this discussion with my postgrad peers who are now admissions tutors and they admit prediction is diffcult to impossible.

The fundamental point is that considering more information results in better selection, for any piece of information knowably correlated with performance (there are some caveats needed here, but that's the simple thought).

Given that school type is known to be correlated with performance, considering it results in better selection.

&gt;You appear to have made this mistake with your argument.

There is no mistake in my argument. At the moment, the private school students who get in are - as a bunch - stupider and less capable of getting firsts, as we both agree.

Given this, it would be *extremely surprising*, although in some wide sense logically possible (given a suitably unrealistic distribution of aptitude amongst the group of state school applicants) if a minor re-jigging towards state school students resulted in admittance of a less intelligent body of students. Given pretty much *any* set of realistic assumptions about the aptitude distribution, this would not be the case. Or do you deny that?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;hen you meet them they have all the desire, passion or charisma one would expect from a sack of potatoes, or there may well be students who don't have the top end qualifications on paper, but when you speak to them they have an overwhelming desire to work hard and a passion for for course that just doesn't fully express itself on paper.

This is possible, but I suspect interviewers *vastly* overestimate their ability to reliably tell such things face to face.

&gt;And if schools aren't preparing their students for an interview, then they are failing, not the universities who are using an interview as part of the admissions process.

Well, the university also undeniably fails to in its objective to admit the best students. I'm not worried about who to blame here - the only consideration is how best to design a system to select the best students. If it turns out that the best students are not reliably selected for at interview, that's a reason to reject using interviews.

&gt;I'm dyslexic, and I did have universities reject me on the basis of my personal statement having spelling mistakes

That's silly of them for the same reasons - assuming they knew you were dyslexic. (On the whole, I imagine it's sensible to select against non-dyslexics with badly written forms.)",0,1320084377,null,0,false,0,c2vwg1s,t3_luz4o,t1_c2vwg1s,t1_c2vvvup,1427808669,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,internet_ham,null,null,"If anyone is interested in my opinion, I'm from a Comprehensive in a fairly unglamorous part of Britain and sent off my UCAS a few weeks back, applying to top Universities. 

This system does not ""favour"" the rich. Parents pay schools to educate their children to a top standard that will get them places, and it does. Discriminating a student based on their education is wrong in both directions.

I have had to work very hard to get the entry profile that I have, it's not perfect, but having to self-teach subjects my school can't support, achieve well despite very poor teaching and generally working hard despite the learning environment I'm in only pays off in the long run. I have known failure, tackled new challenges and overcome very large obstacles, which is something I have over a Private School student. What I really lack are the trimmings like amazing Work Experience, Summer School experience and other extra curricular niceties, but these are only trimmings. 

I think the main difference is that a Private School encourages top academic students, whereas it's a lot harder at a Comprehensive.

Eg, the **Daily Mail wrote**:

&gt;‘Now, if I spot someone I find attractive I challenge myself to seduce him into bed. And I never lose. ‘I simply can’t get enough of the thrill of the chase. 

**Hailey complains:**

&gt;I don’t think I’ve ever challenged myself to seduce someone into bed. 

This, however, was **an interview with her last February:** ([link](http://coedmagazine.com/2011/02/12/british-bisexual-babe-hayley-quinn-will-help-you-bang-29-pics/))

&gt;COED: You call yourself a female PUA. For those of our readers who’ve never heard of it, what’s a PUA?
HAYLEY: PUA stands for ‘pick-up artist’, someone who’s really good at seducing women. I know it’s unusual for a girl, but if there’s one thing I’m pretty good at- it’s seducing women.

OK. Next -

The **Daily Mail wrote:**

&gt;She said: ‘I was very much a one man woman and wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of my life with him. ‘So when I discovered he had cheated on me with not one, but two women while on holiday in Las Vegas, the revelation shook my outlook on life and love to the core.

**Hailey complains**:

&gt;John B (my ex) is a great friend of mine and I would never have wanted something so scathing printed about him.

In **last February's interview,** she said:

&gt;Anyway, initially I hated the whole PUA thing, as the guy I was seeing used it as justification for having an affair with three female porn stars (in one huge orgy!) in Vegas. Really.

Behind the wagon that we flung him in,     
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,     
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;

Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,--

To children ardent for some desperate glory,

I was dressed as the TARDIS, but showed up at my first party of the night with my friend who was dressed as a cop. Unfortunately, most of the people there hadn't seen Doctor Who, so they kept asking if I had coordinated with my cop friend because I looked like I was just a police box.

Later I went to a larger party, where a few people recognized what I was. This one girl asked, ""have you seen Doctor Who?"" to which I replied, ""...yeah?"" thinking maybe she thought I didn't know about the show and just happened to dress as a police box. Then she explained that she really meant there was a guy at the party dressed as the eleventh doctor, and led my friends and me around the party until we found him.

My costume isn't nearly as complicated or awesome (or accurate) as some of the TARDIS costumes I've been seeing here, but here's a pic anyway from 2 seconds after I met the guy dressed as the Doctor: http://i.imgur.com/lMFy0.jpg",0,1320093061,null,0,false,0,c2vxss4,t3_lv3h4,t1_c2vxss4,t3_lv3h4,1427810694,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

It was interesting, however, the point she made on ""Everyone who watches TV (or movies, or reads books, or whatever) has certain tropes that they find irresistable, to the point where if a story contains them, the quality of said narrative almost becomes irrelevant.""
