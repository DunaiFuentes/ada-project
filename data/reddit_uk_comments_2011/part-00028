true,kingzman264,null,null,"I posted this in another thread but i thought it could add some discussion to this thread. 

I tried to find out when she may have been kidnapped. . . 1) The first time she gets 'sick' is when they're all in the Oval Office and she sees one of the Silence. There's a weird flashy scene that cuts to the Silence on the plateau from the picnic scene and Amy says, ""I remember."" 

2) Perhaps, then, it's the scene immediately following? She walks into the Bathroom only to encounter a Silence. Her Ganger would have no clue what's going on because of the Silence's memory augmentation. She's told in that exact scene, ""you will tell the Doctor what he must know and what he shouldnt (somehing like that). . . . "". 

3) Another thing to look at with those scenes is that Amy's reaction to the memory wipe is very different then everyone else's. She remembers the one from the plateau. She shouldnt remember. She remembers tidbits from her conversation in the bathroom about telling the Doctor something. All of this leads me to think It may have actually happened sometime before they even get the letter.

A guy on the other thread said maybe looking through the late episodes of S05 might eludicate some hint or clue as to when she was kidnapped.

&gt; Our clue is that in TIA she told the Doctor she was pregnant but in DOTM she told him she wasn't.

I think this is huge and a very good spot on your part; but, she had already seen the midwife 'hallucination' before the end of TIA.

Surprisingly there was quite a bit. Carlton have a strong history like Liverpool. Have won the championship 16 times (joint most with Essendon).  In early 1900's Jack Worral (the clubs Bob Paisley) took Carlton from a basement dwelling team, to the top in a very short time. Very strong team in the 70's and 80's but they haven't won the title since 1995, but looks like they are coming back with a team built around the midfielder Chris Judd - He is a freak, won the brownloe medal twice.

My own view on Rory, for those who care: [The only reason they would use Rory's Centurion uniform is because his character is dull and they are trying to enliven him a bit.  They can't get rid of him because of Amy's *inexplicable* love of (and marriage to) Rory, and perhaps because he is needed later on.](/spoiler)",0,1306892931,null,0,false,0,c1x39m7,t3_hoohg,t1_c1x39m7,t3_hoohg,1427199743,-30,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-30

Hey, while I'm here, I'll give you my reasoning for Rory being a good companion.  He's a fantastic foil to the Doctor.  Where the Good Doctor is always whizzing about from adventure to adventure, Rory is always a few paces behind asking if it's really a good idea.  In that sense, he's good for Amy, too.  She's reckless, he's protective.  She needs him.  Wait, I'm off track.  Foils!  He's *also* a good foil to the Doc because he has the nerve to stand up to him.  Which not a lot of companions really do.  And sure, it may be born of jealousy, but it's there.  Rory's determined to prove himself and maybe show the Doctor that he's not as much of a wizard as he thinks he is.  Especially since he was plastic.  After he came back, he had more of a connection with the Doctor, like he wasn't intimidated anymore.  And as Amy is still the Doctor's companion, Rory's there to keep an eye on both of them.

true,[deleted],null,null,"tl;dr: Private schools aren't necessarily superior to government schools, despite all the hype you'd see around them if you were to come to the US.

Edit: I use the term ""charter school"" multiple times throughout this post. It's a term for a type of private school designed to replace government run schools. The government foots the bill for charter schools. For true private schools, the government does not. You can say that charter schools are a kind of privately operated government school... They remind me too much of Jennifer Government.

And now on to the actual post...

Well, the answer to this is really quite complex. In the long run, charter schools will ultimately suffer from the same problem as the government run schools: who attends the school tends to set the standard for the school. Currentl, if you come from a rich neighborhood and attend a government school, the school will be a good one, far far far better than privately run schools. This holds true even for states which have cut education spending left and right, such as California. If you're from a middle class neighborhood, however, then your chances of being sent to a good government run school is far lower.

What accounts for the difference between the two economic groups? Again, this has a complex answer. Personally, from what I've seen first hand, this distrinction is due to how rich families are more likely to pressure the school board directly to keep the quality of education very high, and if money is short for the school district, well, these are rich families. Money is never really a problem.

Now, before we get back to the question of private schools versus government schools, it's important to note the recent history of private schools. For many decades, private schools have been, more or less, exclusively for the rich and segregationists. If the rich live in an area which is too hodgepodge and cannot claim residency in an exclusive, privileged area, they will send their child to a privately run school. This is still a trend even into today. However, what we've begun to see in the US is the rise of charter schools. Charter schools are still a recent phenomena. As such, there hasn't been too much research done on the subject.

The question you originally asked is if privately run schools are superior to government schools. For private schools (non-charter), as mentioned, it all depends on the area the school is in. For an affluent area, government schools are typically (far) superior. For a mixed area, it's a flip of the coin. It'll mostly depend on the state as well as the socioeconomic conditions of the area- is segregation prevalent? For an impoverished area, if you find a private school, it will almost always certainly be superior to the government run schools in the area.

As for charter schools, the latest panacea for the American educational system, it's still too early to tell if they're a success or not. Yes, some schools are very successful, but [there are claims that the success stories are simply due to the student selection process](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oew-shaffer12feb12,0,938309.story).

Personally I feel we need to stick to government run schools and reform what we have. Charter schools open up the door to a myriad of problems which would require an essay to document. We're talking regulatory capture, corruption, sacrifcing sorely needed quality of service for profit, child abuse, etc. In [an article by the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/education/02charters.html), we already see that charter schools are not living up to the promise that the American populace is being sold:

""Last year one of the most comprehensive studies, by researchers from Stanford University, found that fewer than one-fifth of charter schools nationally offered a better education than comparable local schools, almost half offered an equivalent education and more than a third, 37 percent, were 'significantly worse.'""

As I mentioned in my parent post, any time you need quality over efficiency, you want something government run. I personally feel that education is no exception to this.",0,1306909491,null,0,true,0,c1x4up2,t3_hokfq,t1_c1x4up2,t1_c1x33ab,1427200489,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

My elder son did Karate for a couple of years, run by the [SAMA Organisation](http://www.samasoutheast.co.uk/) at his school.  However, I don't think he learnt much in that time that would classify as self defence.  Rather, the whole purpose of this so-called ""martial art"" appeared to milking money out of compliant parents for a new belt and certificate every few weeks.  

Like most gullible parents, I was fully supportive of his interest in learning ""karate"".  I thought it would teach him how to fight, how to *avoid* having to fight, and perhaps I would get my car waxed and fence painted in the process.  Alas, no.  It took a couple of years but he eventually came to the same conclusion and asked if he could give it up.

I don't mean to suggest that this is true of karate or all martial arts in general.  I'm just saying that this particular course was more like a sanitised ""play karate for kids"" that would be as much use in a street fight as a water pistol.

I don't really know anything about US education, so what I say now may be even more misconceived than usual, as it's based so much on quickly reading about stuff mentioned in your post. I wasn't even sure I knew what charter schools were -- they sound rather like academies in the UK, and an equally odd sort of notion: that the public should pay for schools but willingly give up oversight of them.

Your point that quality of school depends more on the wealth of the parents sending their children than on the amount the parents pay to send there child there, probably remains true in the UK. It's just that in the UK, wealth of parent and fees paid by parent are perhaps more correlated. Perhaps if they weren't, there would be more of the good government schools and more of the bad private ones.

So I don't mean to say that private schools are necessarily better than government-run schools, I just mean to give one example (private schools vs. government schools in the UK at present) where privately-run organizations are better their government equivalent, to counter your assertion that

&gt; If you have a vital service where quality is more important than efficiency, the only way to do distribute the service is via a government program

Independent schools (in the UK) are also an example of how something can be run privately, not by the government, but not have as its driving purpose profit and efficiency over quality (at least in the UK: from reading a bit about private schools in the US, it seems that those that aren't religious are more likely to be for-profit than their UK equivalents, would that be right?). This is meant to counter your

&gt; the incentives of cost minimization/profit maximization evident in private businesses will be too strong, and thus, quality will be reduced in favor of efficiency.

It's wrong to say: either its government-run, or it's a soulless business that only optimizes itself for maximum profit at the expense of its consumers, because there are alternatives to these two options, and sometimes the alternatives work.

Having said all this I'm pretty cynical about private sector companies being involved in the NHS -- I don't think that has happened because governments have been interested in improving the quality of healthcare, and I doubt further opening the NHS to the private sector will be helpful. But I don't think it's simply because they aren't run by the government that they'll fail.

I'll also add that in the broader scheme we actually do need efficiency. There's a limit to the amount that can be raised by taxes, and we have to efficiently use it to provide the highest quality healthcare, education, etc. that tax-money can buy. Only if we had more tax-money than was needed to provide these services to desirable levels would we be justified in inefficiently emphasizing quality.",0,1306915892,null,0,false,0,c1x58b7,t3_hokfq,t1_c1x58b7,t1_c1x4up2,1427200667,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

THEY were very vocal in their detestation and fear of the new mobile radio devices that were coming into the market at the time. They had seen at first hand what long exposure to strong radio fields had done to their colleagues in their youth.

edit:  well, I suppose I should at least try.

Baby P was never in any form of residential care (should have been) so you can't really draw any comparisons there.

Public sector - eg hospitals, when there is failing of care standards it's normally due to lack of resources and staff being horrendously overworked. Neglect in other words.

Private sector - Profit is put before care standards from the outset. The staff aren't trained to the same standards as the public sector and there is a lack of oversight. Complaints are not investigated with the same rigour as in the public sector. 
As a result, a culture of abuse is far more common. The perpetrators are not caught and reprimanded. Those who would stand up against them are not supported by management and therefore leave. In extreme cases (such as this) abuse becomes the norm and only outside intervention can bring a stop to it.

Your details will be recorded and if you don't provide your name/etc then they will also record your description. Your ethnicity will be recorded and you should be asked to provide your self defined ethnicity.

You have the right to a copy of the search record and can obtain one up to a year after the search from a police station.

Property searches are a bit different...

If a police officer is in your house legally and sees something illegal (e.g drugs) then he/she can seize it. He can not, however, search the house for more - unless he/she arrests you for the possession and then searches under Section 32 of PACE (searching a suspect/premises/vehicle after arrest) which allows the search if looking for

* Dangerous articles

* Articles to assist escape

* Evidence of the offence

However the officer must have reasonable grounds to *believe* (which is higher than suspect) that such articles will be found.

Section 17 of PACE allows police to search a premises for people rather than objects and I won't go into detail on that, but you don't need a warrant. If you want more information please ask but it's not really relevant as I believe you're asking about looking for property.

Section 18 of PACE allows police to search your premises or vehicle if you have been arrested for an indictable (i.e. serious and possibly going to Crown court) offence and there is reason to suspect evidence of that offence, or similar offences, will be found in property you own or control. For example if you are arrested for shoplifting (theft - an indictable offence) then they can search your house for evidence of other stolen articles.

There are two main searches under Section 18, one needs an Inspector to sign it off the other allows officers to do it without speaking to an Inspector. They can only do the second one if it is not practicable to take the offender to custody and speak to an Inspector before doing the search. For example in our previous example the shoplifter says, ""I have more stuff at home but I'll have to show you where it is"", he would need to show them before he goes to Custody (you can't take him out of custody to do the search) and so you bypass the Inspector.

Force can be used if required in any of these searches. But only if reasonable.

Alternatively an officer may search a premises under warrant for other reasons.

I hope this helps, please ask if you have any questions. Please note this is a rough guide and there may be some mistakes. Also please be aware it is *generally* better to allow an unlawful search to take place and fight it in court than it is to resist and end up being arrested on other charges (obstruction, assault police, public order, etc).",0,1306927018,null,0,false,0,c1x5ngo,t3_hnhsj,t1_c1x5ngo,t1_c1wz1r5,1427200867,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"The BBC has guaranteed funding from the state - it does not have to compete so it does not have to justify it's existence . It has a strong left wing element and can often have a strong left wing bias . It also often propagandises. And it has a lot of poor quality programming , particularly the reality type shows . 

After the Hutton report it didn't stand up to the previous labour government . It certainly didn't see the crash coming and it didn't challenge the government on it - ie. it didn't hold the government accountable . It's very narrow in it's news coverage and it often flogs to death items whilst , at the same time , not asking the questions it needs to ask . It's very PC and this is a strongly distorting influence . It strongly pushed the warmist agenda without giving a balanced view .

If you want examples of very good reporting look at [France24](http://www.france24.com/en/) and Australia's [SBS](http://www.sbs.com.au/television) .

I certainly wouldn't watch FOX \ CNN etc. . However I certainly think that the BBC is far from perfect and far from what it used to be . It has come under a lot of criticism over the recent few years and I often hear complaints about it in my travels . Hopefully with the new Director General it will pull it's socks up . However I haven't seen any improvement yet .

* Smith and Jones : [Introduces Martha](/spoiler)
* Human Nature, The Family of Blood : [Introduces the concept of the Chameleon Arch and watch fobs containing Time Lord ""essences"".](/spoiler) Useful for the Utopia episodes.
* Blink : Mostly because it's just good, but it also [introduces the Weeping Angels](/spoiler)
* Utopia, The Sound of Drums, Last of the Time Lords : [These (re)introduce the Master](/spoiler). Not absolutely necessary, but nice if you are going to watch The End of Time.
* Partners in Crime : [It re-introduces Donna as the companion.](/spoiler)
* The Doctor's Daughter : [Introduces Jenny, who *might* come back or be otherwise relevant.](/spoiler)
* Silence in the Library, Forest of the Dead : For the reason you stated.
* The Stolen Earth, Journey's End : [Wraps up Donna and Rose storylines, shows more capabilities of Time Lords to control regenerations.](/spoiler)

true,Linlea,null,null,"&gt; IARC Group 2B: The agent (mixture) is **possibly carcinogenic** to humans. The exposure circumstance entails exposures that are **possibly carcinogenic** to humans. This category is used for agents, mixtures and exposure circumstances for which **there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity** in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals

So there is some evidence that mobiles cause cancer but the evidence is limited. As a result the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer has said that mobiles are possibly carcinogenic. That, by definition, means that mobiles may cause cancer (I don't mean ""by definition"" in terms of absolute objective reality, I mean ""by definition"" in terms of how human beings have chosen to define cancer causing agents: i.e. the categories the IARC define, based on scientific evidence). The title is 100% factually correct.

Interestingly, in the piece I saw on BBC news the reporter was incorrectly trying to downplay the risk. He kept repeating that it can never be known definitively that something *doesn't* cause cancer and so that's why the IARC was saying it may cause cancer. That's untrue though, that's not the reason they've added it to the list. They've added it to the list *because there is limited evidence* that says it does cause cancer, not because it's impossible to say everything doesn't cause cancer. 

Is it possible that your anger is your way of dealing with the uncomfortable fact that is there is some limited evidence that the mobile phones you hold up to your head very regularly may cause cancer? Perhaps because you don't like that idea you're trying to take it out on the messenger - i.e. a deflection strategy? Bear in mind it isn't the BBC's (or any news agency) job to actually determine whether mobiles may cause cancer or not, it's their job to report what the authoritative and recognised intergovernmental agency says.

Anyhow, you polarize a neutron beam by having every neutron's magnetic moments align with each other via a magnetic field. You could then, logically, reverse the polarity by manipulating the magnetic field.  
  
Why you would actually want to do this is beyond me. Timey wimey I guess.  
  
[edit]Actually, you probably could use a polarized neutron beam for a legitimate purpose, if you were some sort of cartoon supervillain who liked to overengineer everything. You could use a polarized neutron beam to operate some sort of machinery. The machine would only operate if it registered a correctly polarized neutron beam. Lone neutrons decay after about 10 seconds, so if you used neutrons it would be harder for an external source to fake the signal. Instead of using the neutron beam as an on/off switch, you could use the orientation of the neutron's magnetic moment to perform this function. This could act as an additional security feature; by ensuring a continuous beam is always entering the detector, a saboteur couldn't use an additional external beam to manipulate the machine.

""it doesn't not have to compete so it does not have to justify it's existence""

Do you mean to say that because it has no financial pressure, it is inevitable that it will produce garbage? (That is the only sense I can make from that sentence).

If so, my response is that I think that's also bollocks. 

Instances of similarity between any BBC garbage and tabloid garbage are an inevitable convergence of the fact that the mass population is maleducated, credulous and incapable. Where BBC content has gone downhill, it's because the quality of the Englishman has gone downhill, to whom the BBC is mandated to provide content for in the same way that the tabloids necessarily have to please in order to make money.

Specific instances of bad journalism? When discussing the overall relevance of the anything, trending is more worthwhile than specifics. Not to mention that journalism isn't supposed to conclude; it is supposed to report. Not to mention that whining about the economy or apportioning blame is pointless: every crash we've ever had and will ever have is the product of the very structure that underpins our society, things which can't be influenced by anyone but the richest people in the world (or you are deluded). You may as well blame the BBC for the rampant theocracy undermining every step forward our species takes.

As for the ""if you can't see that [...]"" garbage spouted by Silversun,

* I never said I couldn't see; I tackled the erroneous assertion that the BBC is irrelevent. 
* 'Failing to see it' wasn't a predicate for anything I mentioned.
* Nothing I said is undermined by anything you said.
* I'm not the one with the semantic content problem (that's the thing you were probably referring to with your mention of ""linguistics"", which is actually the most amusing and malapropism I've read in ages, thank you).",0,1306949727,null,0,false,0,c1x7kwz,t3_hox6v,t1_c1x7kwz,t1_c1x6b28,1427201843,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

**No indication of how many tickets were available at each price category**. That made figuring out a reasonable pitch within your budget (both maximum risk and expected spend) practically impossible. You had to estimate the size of the venue and the likely popularity of the particular session, but as for where to pitch in the seat categories you had no idea at all. Though, more money available wins of course.

**Everyone assumes the allocation process was literally random - I don't think they've said that and can't really see how it can be the case.** In the application booklet terms and conditions they simply talk about 'allocation'. There are a lot of constraints, eg minimising the number of people who got nothing at all; seating multiple tickets together; seats for the disabled; likely targets for particular categories such as disabled, OAPs, children. So fitting those in would certainly push an applicants chances up or down.

Seems to me that allowing themselves to vary the numbers of seats at each price category level might help with constraints, oh and it would also be a handy way of maximising the revenue.

We applied for £1032 and seem to have bit dinged for £166, ie £160 + £6 p&amp;p.

1. It would be far less regressive in terms of cost. At present the cost of the BBC is felt much more heavily by a poor family than a rich one. That bothers me, YMMV. 
2. It would eliminate the need for the stupid OTT threats they make via the advertising campaign.

The government already set the licence fee anyway (indirectly) so if they wanted to cut funding in the longer term, they could. The reason the BBC's funding remains relatively high is that it is comparatively popular. The government which cut it's funding (either now or under my proposed system) would be risking severe unpopularity (in some circles).

the doctor said that Amy hadn't been with them for some time now. Implying that she did get kidnapped by the silence before the season started and taken somewhere. the doctor wasn't around at the beginning of the season so she was ripe for the picking.  
  
I now believe the device that was found in the warehouse was a makeshift device to have a host input their consciousness into a ganger. **see the episode where Martha Jones has her own ganger created and 6x05-06. the devices the acid miners use look very similar**. before I was toying with the idea that it was a makeshift ""loom"".  
  
the way her consciousness was put in allowed her to continue to live out her journey with the doctor while her physical body was with EPL. Every time Amy sees EPL in the show that is her physical body becoming aware of her real location and seeing EPL looking/talking to her. Amy is falling to sleep when the door closes.

TL;DR: Amy has been a ganger the whole season and Rory has been sleeping with her. eeeww.",0,1306958129,null,0,true,0,c1x8i4w,t3_hor11,t1_c1x8i4w,t3_hor11,1427202280,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

It's interesting that you say that. Companies will frequently pay for research where they ask people what they want and create scenarios for them so that they can watch how users navigate. There are two problems with this: To get a decent sample size you need to pay a lot of money (if you fancy making a quick £50 volunteer for one); and the things that people say they do and the things they actually do are quite different.

&gt;Its just infuriating. Instead of a site why not create a cookie blocking plug in similar to script blockers.

This is actually a standard feature of every browser. Go to the settings and you can change it. Set it to ask you every time a site sets a cookie and wait to see how annoying it is.

&gt;Most of a site can or should be viewable without scripts and cookies or should have an option to do so in my opinion.

Unfortunately the web isn't free. It takes money to run servers to get the site to you, make it so that it appears in search engines, take pictures of products, keep updated with new prices, etc.  Changing the site to make it easier for you to find stuff.  Just like when you walk into a shop you'll be on their CCTV (probably), if you go to their website then they're going to know you are there. Even without cookies they are going to know you are there because you'll be requested pages from a server.

When i want to buy something, I don't want links that are dished out to me because they paid to be the first in line, i want to be directed to someone who has worked hard to earn a reputation for goos service and top notch products.

All this ad business is simply bullshit.  it only serves those who will profit from it.  I am aware of the cookie settings on a browser however it is not sophisticated enough.  It doesn't tell you what information the cookies collect and how they use it.  

I do understand the internet takes money to run, but the running of it is overinflated.  Web crawlers create a lot of traffic that site owners have to pay for without any returns on that traffic.  Site owners are dragged into a web of affiliations and services that are completely unnecessary and do not benefit them or the consumers, but creates huge profits for the creation of a need that did not exist if they did not create the environment for its necessity.  

Ebay is a good example of good information that is useful to a buyer.  People leave feedback, and a rating is created from real customers.  What do you get from a google search? 

When google and other companies actually start putting users before profits i'd be for cookies.  But until then, I'd like to know exactly what the cookie is and what information it takes from me, and how they are using that information.  it wouldn't take much for a site to make this information available, and once people feel comfortable with the use of those cookies you will find much more acceptance of them.

So you think my idea in the blog post was a good one?  Clearer explanations of how they use them?

I think the trouble is that near on every website that exists on the web is commercial and exists so that it can make a profit.  Google is a good example - even if originally it wasn't for profit.  As soon as someone says to Google that they'll pay to be top, all ethics go out the window.  Those websites who are top for your average search term hire people to make sure they are top (by doing good technical stuff, but also going out there any begging for or buying links, creating dummy content, infographics, etc).  They stop doing this and they drop from number one because someone else is doing it better and suddenly they don't make as much money.

My last job before this one was for a Government website. The culture of Government on the web and the way they work means they'd never to be able to get there in a long time.

So that means we're a bit stuck where every website is striving for profit (even Reddit) and we have to put up with ads and tracking.

If not the government then how about the Monarchy? Also ridiculous - our monarchy is symbolic and cosmetic. We're not beholden to it in any real way.

Corproations, perhaps? No, because the BBC is still a thorn in the paw of them just as much as it is the government. That was evident by their particular coverage of bankers, rightly pointing out time and again, that the financial institutions are incredibly unpopular over the past two years.

The beeb's loyalty is to itself and (nominally), the British people.* Talk of ""the establishment"" is hooey at best and conspiracy theorist rhetoric at worst.

Sometimes.  If you're logged onto a Google service (eg gmail) then they'll be monitoring what you click on for your account.  If you have a tendency to click on links to a particular website, they'll artificially promote it for you on future searches.  You can turn this off in your settings, but presumably people like it.

The other reason is that Google doesn't sit on one big server - if you imagine it to be like cloud computing - hundreds of computers each with their own almost identical (but not quite) results.  You might just end up connecting to a different one at home to in the office.

true,Ashiro,cnty-england,England,"""TV Licensing"" was set up as a trade name by the BBC to distance the 'good' brand of the BBC from the 'bad' brand of the enforcement of the TV license. Any highlighting by the BBC of the TV licensing shines too much light on who and what these two entities really are. They're both the BBC. Yes I'm aware the BBC contracts out the services of collection to Capita but the fact remains - the legal entity of TVL is the BBC.

Now although I support the TV license I totally and utterly disagree with the aggressive and underhand tactics used for collection and enforcement of the TVL. For example:

 * TV license detector vans and handhelds have never been used as evidence in court. They're used as propaganda devices to scare people. Their technology has questionable effectiveness and legitimacy. To use them in court would mean highlighting this.
 * A TV license officer has no right's above a normal member of the public and yet they will read you a caution under PACE (to intimidate) and try to force you to sign 'confessions' when you don't submit to a search of your premises. Effectively incriminating yourself.
 * Extremely threatening letters that assume guilt.

No, I'm not suggesting it has a pro-government bias particularly - and certainly not of any particular colour; more a pro-State bias, the institutions of same.  A pro status-quo position which is somewhat small-c conservative, a little moth-eaten and smells vaguely of piss.  

It shows up in their choice of language more often than anything, sometimes in what they choose to report and not report and the angles which are taken/how debates are framed.  Talk of the establishment is not hooey at all, and the casual ""conspiracy theorist rhetoric"" attempt to saddle it with some sort of ""crazy"" label doesn't make it so.

I highly recommend Torchwood and Doctor Who Confidential. Torchwood stars Captain Jack Harkness and Doctor Who Confidential is the weekly making of doctor who that comes out each week and gives lots of insight into the creation of the show.

There's also the Sarah Jane Adventures (which I haven't watched), a very large number of books, and a long series of audioplays. Many of the audioplays are highly rated and take different versions of the Doctor to all new depths. (For instance, the 6th Doctor was very unpopular when he was on the show.

The Rani always had her fingernails painted red, which led to the speculation that she was still alive and active in the Universe.

I've owned websites before and was able to get my own website at the top of the search engine until they changed things.

Now when you do a search for something instructional you have to wade through companies that are selling items to even find the how to's.  It just angers people.  Why not use the how too's to actually link it to products instead?  It is getting harder and harder to find information because people are so profit hungry.  Part of the reason is that it cost money to get yourself seen, so you have to pay paul just to get peter to come and see you.

One idea would be an information search with a button switch to buy.  So after you have searched how to do something you can switch to relevant items to carry out the task your researching?

However the general output is very left wing - it is their assumed default state . In this , of course , it ignores a large section of the country that is not left wing - that does not accept this as the accepted state .

I just cannot listen to the BBC or watch it these days . It's so mind numbingly stupid - not only in it's bias and propaganda - but also in it's general programming - [Two Greedy Italians](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011298x) - had to have a commentary - blinken ell !

If I want to find out what is happening in Britain and in the world , for me , the BBC is certainly not the place to go . I watch the [ITV evening news](http://www.itv.com/news/) and [France24](http://www.france24.com/en/) and I read a lot of different Internet sites including the [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/) .

During the expenses scandal the BBC actively manipulated the comments section on their web site thus giving a very false impression of their readers' views . As far as I know this manipulation is still going on .

During the run up to the climate summit a few years ago the BBC gave massive support and coverage - as if everyone believed in warmism no questions asked . The fact is massive numbers of people don't accept warmism - they just don't think that the science proves it , on the contrary it disproves it . The BBC , however , is very warmist .

There is a massive amount of program material generated from within the BBC that operates off a left wing basis - nasty thing happening to nice people in nasty country - isn't this so bad - we have to change the people in this country --- .

Even their science programs have become polluted with the left wing and PC side .

The more that the BBC pursues bias , propaganda and poor quality programming the more ammunition it gives Murdoch to destroy itself .

Following a logical procession we start with the assumption that the BBC is worth the money we're paying for it, that would suggest that if the licence fee became optional the majority would still choose to pay for it due to its value in its current state. This would result in very little change to the channels and nature of the programs.
Alternatively if people chose not to pay and not receive its due to the service not being one the majority of people currently paying for it want. So if you believe that people are more likely to choose not to buy the BBC as an optional product which would result in the situation you describe, it becomes indefensible as a compulsory fee.

true,Ennaeiram,english,Cambridge,"Same here and I agree with everything you've said. I had to have a CRB check before I started, vast amounts of training when I first started and the training has continued throughout the years I've been working. And I don't even work there full-time, I only work when I'm not at university. Those who work full-time are asked to complete an NVQ in care whilst working there and I really don't think the charity I work for could try harder to support and train it's staff in the challenges faced at work. Furthermore, the management are fantastic and I know that we have strong safeguarding procedures in place to protect our residents. I really cannot comprehend anything like this happening where I work, I just wish it was the same everywhere. 

And I also agree with you in that I'm concerned about how support workers will be viewed now, especially when we are (appropriately) dealing with someone who has challenging behaviour. I just hope the public keep in mind that those involved in this abuse case are not generalisations of support workers and that many of us are dedicated and good at our jobs, as well as generally decent human beings. 

I don't think we can attribute this case entirely to a lack of training (although I do agree that it is certainly a factor). I hope that the cruelty towards and the lack of empathy seen in this case would not be shown by the majority of people in this world, regardless of whether they've been trained to deal with the situation or not. There is no excuse for being so fucking heartless.

And finally, this case has highlighted issus with the CQC. Their failure to follow up the concerns raised (multiple times) is one of the most concerning things in this case. They are there for a reason and for the whistleblower in this case to be ignored multiple times is appalling.

I don't think the violence and crime which thrives in poverty Britian is down too Immigration or the EDL, they both thrive from the poverty. What is wrong with the UK, is the current economic climate we find ourselves in mixed with the cultural values of our country.
Take China for instance, or India, or Brazil, they thrive in this economic climate due to their non existance minimum wage and their ability to make workers work long hours for little or nothing. This puts Britian at a disadvatage, as this means China makes everything we want to make.

I'm genuinely interested in hearing your thoughts and arguments. As one of the ""middle class liberal wankers"" you described earlier I don't agree with the politics or methods of the EDL. My experience of multicultural Britain has always been a positive one. I'm white and was born in England to an English family. I have Asian friends, I have black friends, I have white French, Turkish and Polish friends. I'm friends with girls and I'm friends with gays. I genuinely don't understand what difference race makes. I don't subscribe to the ""England for the English"" argument, as anybody who has studied even basic history will know that the English are a mongrel 'race' made up of Angles, Saxons, Normans, French, Germans, Danes etc. The 'right' of any particular race to live here changes depending on how far back you look. 

I don't subscribe to the ""they took our jobs!"" argument, most people I know personally who are on benefits are white and don't work because they can't be bothered or were so busy messing about at school that when it came to get a job, they weren't qualified enough. They see menial jobs as beneath them and think that the world owes them a debt.

Those EDL supporters I have met in person seem to have a problem articulating exactly *why* they feel so strongly about issues such as immigration. They simply state ridiculous slogans about Sharia law and the islamification of the UK. They do themselves no favours in terms of presenting themselves in a positive or constructive way.

The discussions and studies I've read are a far cry from the rhetoric spewed by the likes of the EDL, that's for sure.

I'm not quite sure what ""choice"" I presented.

I, as with most things, take the stance that I don't really have a huge amount of evidence to dictate what the immigration level or policy should be, but I will call people who oppose it without basis, as the reasons can frequently be racist.

I do have the stance that it's quite possibly not even in the top 10 issues the UK has right now and that the mere fact it gets so much discussion in certain places (e.g. The Mail) whilst real, more severe issues aren't mentioned at all, is a sign of underlying racism in a lot of cases.",0,1307032964,null,0,false,0,c1xe6uu,t3_hpw9c,t1_c1xe6uu,t1_c1xdn98,1427205656,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

&gt;In The Tribes of Britain, archaeologist David Miles says around 80 percent of the genetic characteristics of most white Britons have been passed down from a few thousand Ice Age hunters.

I have absolutely no problem with skin colour or race, but I dislike those who fail to integrate with the culture of the UK, those who know little to no english, despite living here.

Before you yell racist etc, look to what leaders have said, Merkel and [Cameron](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12371994) for example, Multi-culturalism has failed. It causes problems due to frictions of integration, people segregate themselves into camps and do not accept one anothers cultures, it causes tension and sometimes even violence; from **both sides**.

Personally, I think immigration is great, it means more money is generated and spent in the UK, and if UK nationals arent willing to do the jobs and foreigners are, even better. The main issue is when these people create insular communities and isolate themselves. Maybe the locals aren't friendly enough to immigrants, I dont know.

The article you link to just goes further to illustrate the point I am trying the make. Viewing biological origin as the defining characteristic of 'Englishness' is, in my view narrow minded. By your own admission, if you go back far enough you will find an ancestor or part of you genetic makeup which is not 'from here', even if it is only 20%. Why does it matter where you happen to be born or who your parents were? I live in London, I work, I consume public services and I pay my taxes. However, my recent family history suggests that my family originates from Cumbria. Should I move back? Do I belong there because an ancestor was born there? Am I straining public finances in London unduly? My wife's family is from Newcastle and I suspect some Viking ancestors. Should I send her back to the Toon? Seems like geography and genetics have a lot to answer for. 

Surely, contribution to our society is equally, if not more worthy? You don't consider the undeniably extensive social and cultural contributions of the groups I referred to.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Just my penny's worth - 

A few years back when I started uni, I moved into a new flat and decided not to have a TV license, but to keep a TV for DVDs etc... After a couple of threatening letters, I phoned TVL and said I didn't need a license. Soon after, we had an unannounced visit from an inspector. We invited him in, switched on the TV and handed him the remote control. He flicked through a few channels, saw that none of them were tuned in, and left in under  90 seconds. Easy done, I thought. But it didn't stop the threatening letters. Every month, court threats etc... At the time I lived in a block of 9 flats that had a single letterbox at the main door, and all the post is left on a shelf to be collected by each resident. It could prove embarassing to have your neigbours noticing regular 'notification of impending action' and 'final demand' style letters coming to your address when you haven't even committed an infraction.

The point the OP is making is in response to the extremely threatening approach TVL takes despite the fact that it is offering a SERVICE, that nobody is obliged to use that service, and that broadcast television isn't the only source of video content; there is in fact a market and consumers have choice. Think back to another self-revenue-generating public service: The trains when they were a nationalised industry. You would be fucking furious if you were to receive threats of prosecution because one day you decided to start walking rather than renew your season ticket. Perhaps they'd have rentathugs following you to work to make sure you *really were* walking, just like they bang on the door to *your home* to make sure you *really are* reading a book. And don't try telling me that's a false analogy, it's pretty damn close in principle.

I do not condone the OP's actions, but nor do I condemn them. TVL's threatening approach is inflammatory and liable to encourage a backlash, however petty.

Immigration is a hugely complex issue but the tabloids boil it down to such stupidity that almost everyone has an opinion on it. Consequentially, people can feel passionate about things they don't actually understand.

Taken as a whole Britain's migrant population have a positive contribution to the economy and create more jobs than they consume.

Right wing groups exist in every country and they prey on issues of the day to garner memberships and appear more mainstream. If you'd like to see an interesting case study in this, see the rise of the Nazi party.

Britain's bleak economy and consequential lack of jobs has fuck all to do with immigrants and everything to do with successive governments hell bent on growing the financial services sector at the expense of industry. What followed was an economy enormously sensitive to global market forces and sure enough things promptly went tits up as soon as the US economy did.

Ironically, immigrants make industry on British shores more affordable and actually have a countering effect.

true,lokithecomplex,uk,Edinburgh,"Allow me to step in and play devil's advocate.

There's two crucial issues in the debate - economics and culture - both are viewed differently according to class.

For the middle class their understanding is global. Their perspective is international, both for their career and pleasure. They assume they will need to move across borders if needed for both work and holidays. They aspire to living and working abroad. Politically they believe in global trade or global aid. They maybe members of the international jet set. Depending on their level they already are competing on a global level.

The opening of labour markets to Eastern Europe has meant cheap plumbers, shop assistants and other services. All culture is as fascinating as an ancient trinket in a museum or an exotic unpronounceable listing on a menu. Religion is nonsense so can't be taken seriously. They don't consider themselves as having anything as gauche as a ""nationality,"" they are internationalists. If they want multicultural area they move to get it. If they don't like it they move to a mono culture.  For them culture is a cross between a supermarket and a museum.

The ~~working class~~ underclass is selling their labour or living off the state, remember most poor people work. They are competing for temporary unskilled work. Often living in a former industrial area which has never recovered. They don't think about moving, their plans for ""getting out"" have not worked. Most people do not ""get out"" of the area and some come back. They are fighting for the menial jobs that the middle class look down on. They feel they are in a zero sum game with foreign labour.

Everyone has a sense of belonging. If people are under pressure and feeling alienated they will hold on to that identity even stronger what else do they have to hold on to? They don't have the choice about moving away from immigrants or even the choice to move to the ones they like. They live far closer to the poor of different ethnicities than the middle class and so they'll know the cultural differences of religion, education, drink, food and sex habits.

These two models are simplistic but its the context of why middle class white people might be less likely to be in the EDL.

Are the EDL racist? Sure. But where does racism come from? I suspect most from fear, both economic and cultural. Are we happy to tell a white family who move out of a predominantly Islamic area not to be so racist? Should we be forcing refugees to disperse around the country? In practice racism is not a scientific enterprise carried out with portable gene testing kits. Its a gut thing carried out by sight and sound.

Claiming the UK is a mongrel nation is both technically wrong and irrelevant. As if racism of any kind could be justified on genetic grounds. Cultures exist and races exist, even English cultures exist. Its still not the grounds for racism. 

The traditional answers to mass immigration were trade union rights, labour laws and wage control from the Left. From the Right they believed in very controlled immigration and a high degree of assimilation through cultural norms. But both sides have dropped these beliefs. The Left has embraced freer markets and dropped calls for labour rights and sees multiculturalism as way of breaking cultural norms. The Right has dropped culture and borders and is in favour of global markets and sees multiculturalism as way of breaking the welfare state. Why would people of different cultures agree to pay for the other?

I'm not saying I have answers to these difficult questions but I do look to Reddit for more thoughtful analysis of a difficult topic. I hope we can try to understand why someone might join the EDL rather than do some circlejerk reaction of saying ""ITS THE DAILY MAIL WOT DONE IT""

**tl;dr** Its complicated and answers aren't easy.

A true charver is a mix of several things, but it has nothing to do with a poor background.  Generally a charver attitude includes:

* general racism most often including words like paki, can extend to defacing shops owned by people with a different skin colour to you
* a vast collection of sportswear, sticking to brands that won't incite your friends to make fun of you
* little use of said sportswear for actual sport
* other clothing items that conform to the hivemind that you belong to including, but not limited to Rockport boots, Berghaus jackets and in the past the classic Burberry cap
* a penchant for 'rave' music as though time stopped in 1991
* an equal fervour for blasting said music from a 1.0l supermini of some description

If he WAS the real Doctor, why fuss around with the envelopes and the coordinates? Why not just take the TARDIS and pick up the people he wanted to collect? As far as I remember, we don't even *see* the TARDIS in that episode until after they meet up with The (real) Doctor. Clue #2, and it's *also* staring us in the face.

If he WAS the real Doctor, you *honestly* believe he'd invite everyone to watch his own death, and then forbid them from interfering, and then do nothing at all to try to stop it? He goes to that spot at that time for a reason: *to die*. That's not The Doctor's style. Since when have we *ever* known The Doctor to just give up and keel over without trying a million possible exit strategies first?

If he WAS the real Doctor, then where are 200 years' worth of companions? Why not invite them to witness his death? Up til season 6, Amy and Rory are just like any normal companions (and arguably, they still pretty much are). So the Doctor goes through 200 years in the same body, and then he wants the only witnesses to his death to be River (whoever she is) and a couple random companions from 200 years ago? No. Something is definitely fishy here, and it's starting to reek.

That's NOT The Doctor. It just can't be. You knew something was off (or you should have) as of the first episode of the season. The flesh is the best explanation at the moment. Maybe there's another explanation coming up, but I'm not sure how they'd manage it without making the story about The Doctor again instead of about Amy.

I don't know what you mean by ""He can't get away with the trick anymore."" Are you going to lead an army with pitchforks to his door if it turns out to be the flesh Doctor who died? Is he going to be tried in the International Television Court? It's TELEVISION. Sometimes they use cheap tricks.

We were told the next day that the Doctor switches actor every episode. Each week we were excited to see that Tom Baker was still the Doctor. Every staturday night my brother and I would watch 'Are you being Served', 'Keeping Up Appearances', 'Mr.Bean', 'Red Green', then the good Doctor. I continued to watch through the 5 doctor but I don't think I caught one episode of the 6th before returning to Ace and the Doctor. 

The worst thing though was Pledge drive where they split up the serials into there single episodes and begged for 15 minutes that a Tote bag was really worth alot.

That is not racist. If you've immigrated to England, I was born here.. I deserve to live here more than you do. Not because I just so happened to be born here, as is how you're thinking about it. But from a genetic stand point, I am my mothers child. My mother is English, her father was English, I am English. Can you see what I'm saying? My family helped to build this country to what it is, yours didn't. Therefore I have more of a right to be a part of it. 

Sure, you can it's luck that you're born in England. I can say to you it's luck that you're born human, and go and live with a tribe in Africa that only eats meat once a month..

Hell, by the time Troughton is finished, he's a pretty redeemable and heroic guy.

I'm facing a particularly bad dilemma at the moment. I've been working my way through the show, am in season 14, and really don't love Tom Baker. Well, it's not that I don't love him, but I was much more into Pertwee and Troughton and their respective stories. I just feel like there are a fair number of not-so-great Tom Baker episodes.

Maybe the storylines get better with time.

The Silents are definitely ""with a twist"" — who are they, where did they come from, why are they here, what do they want? They're going to turn out to be more than ""just"" another alien, methinks. I half wonder if they were originally engineered to fight the Weeping Angels.

Then they all got invited to season 6 by OldDoc.

   It does not disrupt the timeline, but does rewrite it, for OldDoc to send PreDoc a message. In Big Bang 2 the Doctor that's shot by the Dalek teleports and tells his younger self (by 12 minutes) to go to the roof, before 12mOldDoc goes to the Pandorica to recuperate.

   All we know about OldDoc prior to now is that he was running from something (for 200 years) faster than he's ever run before, until he allows himself to be killed by something in the spacesuit. There's more going on here than meets the eye; consider the shadowy figure by the shed in 6.1, and the first Silent that Amy ever sees up on the ridge.

I was unaware that PBS reran Doctor Who, I'm sad that I didn't know that.

But really it doesn't change my main idea, which I know I didn't explain well enough so I'll try now.  TV in the 60's, 70's, 80's, (hell even the 90's) had cutting edge visual effects, or costumes, or scientific theory of the time.  But rewatching the old shows today, they feel more hokey.  They're still enjoyable but it takes more to suspend the disbelief (Pretend you didn't see the zipper, if you will).  And that's due, at least in part, to being spoiled by modern effect/costumes/theory.  And in 10 years, our current effects will be hokey.  Point: each era had its own style and it's own feel.

The 90's had their own new feelings and effects that Doctor Who didn't examine.  So, those of you who were kids during times that Doctor Who ran new episodes can rewatch, and reminisce on days gone by.

People working for lower wages is just the end result of us all clamouring for the 'cheapest possible price' and sod the consequence. You are competing with the whole world as a result of this and unless you have an 'uncopyable' skillset or are for whatever reason 'truly irreplaceable' then I'd start retraining now.

Regarding owning a house, that appears to be a British (Anglo?) obsession. Most of Europe seems quite happy renting, I don't know why it's made such a ""life goal"" in the UK. Especially given that you'll probably use a lot of the cost of it up in care homes when you're old and your offspring will be paying 40% on a sizeable chunk of what is left. Owning a house also means work opportunities are fewer as you're tied down.      
     
The housing crash will have affected areas outside of the S.E. more, I could never understand how property got so expensive there - given how much lower the salaries were as a multiple in order to pay the mortgage, and so a crash there was inevitable.

Personally I think that having an international qualification scheme is long overdue but I dislike the reduced amount of choice that the IB offers. Although I think we should study more languages as they are useful in all fields as we live in an increasingly globalised world. 

Being forced to study humanities subjects isn't if you don't want to study those at university. (History is really interesting, but if it means I can study less maths then I'd rather do the maths).

But yeah, in qualifications like Further Maths, I'd be wary of saying the IB is automatically better than A levels as once you get out of Travel and Tourism territory not all the A levels are as bad as you would believe, I recall Chemistry being quite difficult too.

But of course the profit seeking nature of the exam boards combined with the schools seeking to climb league tables will cause 'dumbing down' to occur. Which is why a single international system which isn't run by private companies would be better.

Bit of proof needed there I think. Murdoch's newspapers swing toward whatever party is going to win anyway - look at the way they swung toward Labour in the 90s when the Conservatives were finished, and look how they swung back to the Conservatives in 2008 or so once they had a consistent lead over Labour. Why wasn't BSkyB sold to him in 1997?

If his papers didn't back the winner (that is instead of making the winner) they couldn't beat their chests and say ""It's the Sun wot won it"".

Don't know why people go on about him as if he is the boogeyman. Owning a bit more of a company is not a big deal - and the important things, such as impartiality, accuracy and undue prominence will remain intact (as regulated by Ofcom). Especially if Sky News is independently managed as has been rumoured.

As for Sky being a major ISP - it isn't as if it is the only ISP available. There are hundreds of ISPs in this country. If people don't like what Sky may do to the internet service then move elsewhere.

IIRC Sky had a lot more ownership by News Corp before it merged with BSB. Would people be whinging if News Corp had 100% ownership as a result of never relinquishing it to anyone else?",0,1307113328,null,0,true,0,c1xkvwa,t3_hqpxt,t1_c1xkvwa,t3_hqpxt,1427208878,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

Examples: Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Iron Man, sure, they're powerful and use force as their primary weapon. Batman, Green Arrow, the Fantastic Four (Dr Richards, at least), Blue Beetle II, Elongated Man... they use intelligence and their resources to fight crime, similar to the Doctor. Green Arrow is an also (a rich, well-connected) advocate for the poor, Richards is a brilliant doctor of science, Blue Beetle II an inventor, Elongated Man a detective, and in the comics, Batman is considered the ""World's Greatest Detective."" None of them would survive fighting crime if it weren't for their trickery or diplomacy or simply their ability to out-think and outmaneuver their opponent -- just like the Doctor.

There was a storyline in the latest iteration of Blue Beetle (III) where the new guy, a teenager who ended up with a powerful suit that has a shit tonne of weapon capabilities, could not beat the bad guys. He just couldn't. Until he took advice from friends of Blue Beetle II (now deceased) and read up on II's notes and books and information and everything and realized that it didn't matter that he was wearing a suit that allowed him to fly and could shoot holes through anything and could let him travel in time. His enemies could do that and more, so the only way he was going to win was to trick them into revealing themselves, and reveal the 'humanity' in the bad guys' main weapons. It was very Doctorish, actually, and very much intellect over brute force.

true,Dain42,tardis,TARDIS,"OK, so here's what happened: the BBC had this nasty policy of ""junking"" old tapes (as CircaNimrod said) by taping over them. Magnetic tape was expensive! (Side note, this nearly happened to Monty Python, but Terry Jones bought the recordings from the BBC.)

Though the tapes are lost, the BBC made ""telesnaps"" of most/all episodes, to serve as a record of their performance for the actors. They couldn't very well take a recording with them when auditioning for new roles; it just wasn't technologically feasible. These were taken at approximately 15 second intervals throughout the episode. They've based a few reconstructions on these at their website, such as the 2nd Doctor story, ""The Macra Terror"": http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/photonovels/macra/  (Interesting side note: this is the ONLY story where the Macra are featured until the 10th Doctor episode, ""Gridlock"". Delightfully obscure.)

There also exist audio recordings for many episodes. These are generally not official, but made by fans directly from the TV broadcasts. These can be cleaned up, and paired with telesnaps (or released as just audio) in order to bring as much of these stories as possible to us.

They've also done an animated reconstruction of one 2nd Doctor story using the extant audio and all of the above as a guide.",0,1307115449,null,0,false,0,c1xl3nq,t3_hqstu,t1_c1xl3nq,t3_hqstu,1427208978,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

No, you're called nigger. Doesn't matter about your disposition, your education, your character, how polite you are or what achievements you've accomplished...you're a nigger.

If you do an image search for ""chav"", you do not see images of ant-social people from various backgrounds, you see lots of working class people. So are all the people we see in that google image search anti-social? Certainly not. But that is what is in your mind when you see those images. They're chavs, they're anti-social and we're allowed to hate them.

Labels become stereotypes and stereotypes become engrained. And before you know where you are your kids are being bullied at school.

No it's not. You've not substantiated the claim, I'm just to take it on face value that is what is happening and it's widespread. Who is doing the bullying? Are they in the same school? A school of seemingly mixed social class and the working class kids are being bullied by the supposedly better off? Where is this happening? Show me a report.

&gt;If you do an image search for ""chav"", you do not see images of ant-social people from various backgrounds, you see lots of working class people.

No, I see a lot of people seemingly in various states of intoxication, largely holding cans in their hands outside of anything even remotely resembling a pub or even inside their own homes, with a large percentage giving the finger to the camera. Most people I know would call that anti-social.

Now do a search for ""working class"" and notice all the beer cans and Burberry suddenly vanishes and you're faced with images of miners, trade union rallies and people affected by urban decay. No one would call anyone in those photos a chav. If you have an example of this happening, again, show and prove.

Arguably, it might not have been working during The Eleventh Hour because of similar circumstances (the episode shows that the Atraxi were translating their message into lots of Earth languages) but I'm not sure about that one. 

He also mentions (maybe in Planet of the Dead?) that he can speak every language but I think once or twice he's been confused (such as with the text on the space station in The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit).

She's kidnapped and brainwashed by the Silents as a child and sent to 1969 to kill him while dressed in a spacesuit that also doubled as her time machine, because they knew that the ""Silents would fall"" due to the Doctor's actions in 1969, and wanted to try to prevent it. River, feeling remorse for her actions after she commits the murder, eventually warns him at some time in his future, and some 200-odd years later he travels back to 1969 so that he can ensure that he's the one killed instead of his younger version who's supposed to have another 200 years ahead of him.

The Doctor and River, being the only 2 Timelords in existence (well, 1 1/2), marry and have children of their own to reinvigorate and restore the Timelord race (never question the morality of a Timelord or judge them by our own standards - they live by their own rules, so a father/daughter marriage might be normal for them - genes also might not be the issue for their race that it is for Humans). Her killing of him as a child is eventually found out, and she's imprisoned for it.

Clue 1: Amy in the bathroom with Joy- She remembers the other times she saw them and takes a picture on her phone. Joy after only 2 views knows that for some reason she remembers saying ""is that a mask""

Clue 2: It's been 3 months. They say they have seen them hundreds of times. Over that period they have gather bits of information.  Remember the biggest piece here was River's readings about the tunnels. They know something is there even before they start running. 

Clue 3: The Doctor says he still doesn't know what they look like but they are using the picture from Amy's phone to look at a hologram of them. So, I'm sure they can use the hologram to brainstorm. Which is most likely how he figured out about the subliminal messages.

e.g. ""Should schools be allowed to snoop on packed lunches?""  The word snoop is pejorative.  

It could be part of a project on healthy eating, it could be voluntary, it could be carried out/instigated by the children themselves, it does not imply compulsion.

The point is, if you are just copying out questions that the newspapers themselves have phrased, you're reproducing the bias as they can phrase the question in such a way that it will elicit a desired response.

Compare:
""Should schools be allowed to..."" ""Should Madonna be allowed to...""

with

""Should new rules be imposed to ban...""

Depending on how you start the question, you're positioning the perspective of the reader on different sides of the debate.  Often the debate itself is just a false controversy or wedge issue dreamt up, exaggerated and imposed by the paper anyway.

I watched Pyramids of Mars (Tom Baker) at my grandparents house some time in 1985, then when I got back home I demanded to watch Doctor Who (I was 5) and our local PBS was showing Davison's era, so I skipped like 6 years in between the first two DW stories I ever saw, but I was 5, so it was ike ""time machine!"" ""funny clothes!"" ""robots!"" ""everybody talks funny!"" (I'm American and I was 5). 
But when you get obsessed with something when you're 5 and there's piles of it to absorb and you find out there are adults who are obsessed with it so it's kind of ok, you stay obsessed. 
It is possible to see every episode of Doctor Who. Takes a while. Nobody assumes you've seen all of it. Some people have though. And that's ok.  There's 31.5 seasons of it to watch now total. (Well, some of it got wiped.) 

Anyway, I'd start with last year's season (Series 5. Nobody actually calls it season 31, except to be pedantic) and see if you dig the general idea. Then, after you're caught up, go back and watch Series 1-4. At this point you will know whether you want to watch classic Who. At least you'll know what to watch when you're bored for a while. Possibly a reallllllllly long while. But what do I know?

tl;dr Doctor Who isn't esoteric. They just told you that to make you think it's cool. It IS cool, but it actually has built in mechanisms to make it accessible (though some starting points are better than others.)

I can understand why the word Chav has come to be seen as a coded attack on the working class, because it has no defined meaning. It's meaning is quite broad, and yet it remains derogatory.

So he'll control Sky, I'm still failing to see why this is such a bad thing. His son is already Chairman of the company so his influence over the company is already rather large. What exactly is he going to do, that is what I want to know. What exactly will Rupert Murdoch do when he controls Sky that will cause the end of days?

Desmond controls two papers who have an daily readership of around 1.3 million people, that is a sizeable amount of people, especially interms of newspapers. Channel 5 has around 1% fewer audience share than Channel 4 and while that makes it the smallest terrestrial network it's still far larger than any single Sky channel. So why was his takeover of Channel 5 not resisted in the same way as Murdoch's? I'll tell you why, because his name isn't Ruport Murdoch.

I think you are missing the point.

Firstly, he couldn't turn Sky News into a Fox News style broadcast because we have laws that would prevent that kind of thing.

As you say Desmond controls 2 papers with a daily readership of 1.3 million. Murdoch controls The Sun which alone has a readership of over 3 million, along with other newspapers that he owns dwarfs Desmonds holdings.

&gt;Channel 5 has around 1% fewer audience share than Channel 4 and while that makes it the smallest terrestrial network it's still far larger than any single Sky channel

But that's the issue. The Channel 5 network is about 3 channels, Sky is a much larger network. BARB figures put Channel 5 at 4.3%, and Sky's main channels (plus Sports and Movies) adds up to a larger network with more viewers. How many of those C5 viewers are watching it on Sky?

They also indicate that 44% of households have Sky in their home. So Murdoch will not only completely control the majority of UK newspapers, but also the majority of UK TV channels.

Desmond is a small fish compared to Murdoch.

&gt;What exactly will Rupert Murdoch do when he controls Sky that will cause the end of days?

I don't care about what he'll do. It's more a case of what will happen to our overall media industry since 1 man controls so much of it. 

It's pretty easy to ignore Channel 5 if you want. But if you want Sports or Movies, you already have no choice but to go with Sky. ",0,1307192625,null,0,false,0,c1xqcgf,t3_hqpxt,t1_c1xqcgf,t1_c1xq6ma,1427211516,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,brennus,uk,Salford,"And Spain is under the same EU government as us.

The whole point of taxation is that people give money whether they directly benefit by the same amount or not. If people only got back exactly what they paid, then you may as well just have everyone paying for everything as they go along (e.g. toll roads). It's just like how it's worthwhile paying insurance premiums for things even when you never claim.

This does mean your tax money may be spent on roads you never use. I know people that have driven more on Spanish roads than on Yorkshire ones, but they've never complained about their money being spent in Yorkshire.

Historically, we were indeed under a single government covering all the UK, but it's more complicated now. There's town council level, county councils, constituent nations of the UK, the UK itself, the EU and, in some respects, larger things like Commonwealth, The UN and NATO.

If someone can demonstrate that focusing efforts exactly on the UK level and spreading wealth only within that scope is the most efficient size at which to do it, then I'd certainly support a UK independent from Europe. But perhaps the EU is a more effective size? Perhaps we should go the other way and break up the country into smaller parts (Wales, East Anglia, Scotland, Mercia)?

The point is that saying the EU is bad because your money (on one particular project mind, never mind all the subsidies we get for fishing and farms) goes to Spain is no more valid than complaining that your council tax is spent on things for your neighbours.

http://watchseries.eu/serie/doctor_who is a good place to watch it, though it doesn't have all of the specials on there. http://watch-doctor-who-online.com is also a great place, and I believe it does include the specials.

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"Don't want to argue with you either :-) I just think it's overstating to describe the media as complicit when really they were as hoodwinked as other parts of society by an unprecedented campaign of misinformation. And even though you're right that most outlets accepted the government's case that action was necessary and legitimate, many did so uncomfortably and based on what the 'facts' were at the time - 'facts' that the same media outlets were only later able to uncover as deception. Moreover, even with major outlets giving their support, there were still many voices of serious dissent - journalists, MPs, campaign groups and other independent new outlets - so I really don't think it's true to say that a) the media was complicit b) had media ownership or conduct been different the public would have been more aware or the government would have been curbed.

The fact is the UK and US governments hyped up (or manufactured) a case for war based on the supposed existence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. They successfully misled their own Parliament/Congress, they misled their allies, they misled the UN, and they misled the media. Do I wish the media could have uncovered the deception for what it was and prevented the war? Of course. Do I think that was possible given the facts at the time and the difficulty in establishing where the truth actually lay? No.

It is of course always possible that the media could have taken a stronger line against the rush to war and caused more difficulties for the government - but given the lengths the government went to in order to invade Iraq, I doubt even this could have prevented them.

true,TabascoQuesadilla,mcgann,McGann,"Start with either the 2005 series (""Series 1"" of the re-launch) with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, or with the 2010 series (""Series 5""), with Matt Smith as the Doctor.  Both are good starting points.

Basically, if you want to catch up as quickly as possible, start with Series 5, catch up, then go back to Series 1.  If you want to get the full experience, start with Series 1.

You *could* watch some old (1963-1989) episodes, but you don't need to watch any of them to understand anything that happens from the 2005 relaunch onward.  (And really, it's 5 seasons [relaunch only] versus 32 [""classic""+relaunch] if you start watching from 1963's Season 1, so watching all of the relaunch isn't that big of a chore if you think about it).

I repeat:  **you do not need to watch any ""classic"" episodes to get the full experience of the re-launched show**.  While it's true that the re-launch *is* a continuation of the ""classic"" series (not a re-boot), it's also designed with viewers who have never seen the ""classic"" series in mind.

**Important things for you to know**:

- After you finish Series 4 (the one with the Doctor and Donna), you *need* to watch the Specials (""The Next Doctor,"" ""Planet of the Dead,"" ""The Waters of Mars,"" and ""The End of Time"").  A lot of people don't realize that there's anything in between Series 4 and Series 5, and miss out on a lot of important stuff.

- The first half of Series 1 is a little rough (especially ""Aliens in London""/""World War Three""), but it gets *so much better*.

- The first 5 series, plus the specials (except for ""Planet of the Dead"") are all available on Netflix Instant Watch.  [Series 1-5](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who/70142441?trkid=2361637#height1143) (includes ""The Next Doctor"" at the end of Series 4), [""The Waters of Mars""](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who_The_Waters_of_Mars/70128730?trkid=2361637#height1457), [""The End of Time""](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who_The_End_of_Time_Parts_1_2/70135902?trkid=2361638) (and remember, those two need to be watched in between Series 4 and Series 5).
- Series 6 is currently airing - the mid-season finale airs today in the UK, next Saturday in the US (on BBC America), and the back half of the series will start in the fall.  The first half will be available on DVD/Blu-Ray on July 19, so you can catch up on the first seven episodes of S6 before the last six air in the fall.

I think that's about it.

Once they realized that there was both a market to sell the old shows and realized that there was a historic reason to preserve them, they stopped destroying tapes, but a lot of damage had been done.

Luckily, DW fans are awesome, so a lot of people had recorded the audio off their TV's to listen to like radio plays, and a lot of photographs were made during the filming of episodes, so there was some recovery of episodes by combining the audio recordings with the photos so you have the episodes as a kind of narrated comic book.

Also, DW was shown internationally, so some episodes were discovered in foreign markets intact and copied, but there are still 108 episodes lost, including 11 full serials.

Troughton's Doctor and suffered the most from this, of his 21 serials, only six are intact, and four are lost in their entirety. 63 of his 119 episodes are lost. Hartnell lost a lot as well, including his final episode (not counting his return in The Three Doctors) where he regenerated. Hartnell had more complete serials missing, but more intact ones as well.

The old is great but most details are fuzzy and honestly though I'm sure this will not be a popular statement to other long time fans, the old show is really not a way to introduce the show to new audiences, the pacing is so slow, the effects so cheesy that its really hard to get younger viewers into it.  I have tried with some of my favorite episodes and though my kids find most of them hilarious that isn't the reaction I was going for. :(  A good example, I tried to explain The Rani to my wife and kids and showed them Mark of the Rani...they found most of it boring but thought the scarecrow scene, the rock throwing scene and the dinosaur particularly hilarious.  That was the last time I tried that.

They then proceeded to use a variety of similar mechanisms increasingly to winnow the suggestible wheat from the rest of us chaff.

You're tarring all of the people involved with the same brush. There will be varying degrees of lunacy. It's easy for an educated person with job prospects living in a nice area to paint any of the views expressed by these people as lunatics, but the way that they recruit is mainly from the disaffected. They give people a scapegoat in the form of immigration. If you're from a posh bit of Surrey you're probably not going to be massively in need of that, but if you're living in Bradford or Oldham where there are real race-based tensions and real race-based concerns, you're going to be a fairly easy target to recruit, especially if you're unemployed.

Whether or not the EDL is a legit political movement is a matter for the courts to decide, but the ill feeling amongst these people has been festering for a long time. If we want to stop the EDL, banning it won't work.

true,nevercomment,uk,null,"You should definately read Derren Browns chaper on hypnotism in his book tricks of the mind.

Here's some of what he talks about:

* Different people have different suggestabilities. In general, 20% are very suggestable, 20% almost impossible, and everything inbetween.

* You have to want to be hypnotized.

* More intelligent does not necessarily mean less suggestable.

* Difference between stage hypnotism (were volunteers are rooted out so as to be left with the most suggestable/some people wanting to go along with the act [which is still kind of suggestability]) and one on one hypnotism, which has other uses than entertainment. In my opinion, those going into hypnotism for entertainment are probably more likely to be bad hypnotists after a bit of money.

* You can't make people do something they are against, they have to want it to happen.

* You can't be hynotized forever, only a matter of hours. If you were hypnotized and then went to sleep it would have worn off by morning.

Derren Browns chapter is what took me from being an uninformed cynical prick to much more accepting of hypnotism and its uses (such as helping people stop smoking).

What I find much more interesting is River's speech to the Doctor. She mentions that he'll fall, and I think part of that is him realizing how much he's become a warrior. 

I think that's what the Doctor referred to in ""The Impossible Astronaut"" when he said he's been running. He's been running from the truth about himself, rather than an alien menace. 

So the River Song reveal? Bit of a letdown, but there is so, so much that needs to be revealed just coming from that revelation. What'll happen with Amy, Rory and River? Where is the Doctor going? Will they be having separate adventures in the next episode, with the companions doing the Hitler-y part of the adventure while the Doctor [searches for the child](/spoiler)?

The Doctor did have some interesting flash-backs at one point that did seem to indicate that Amy's half-Time-Lord-daughter was the girl in the spacesuit. Now, she might not have been in the spacesuit when it killed the Doctor; however, if she *was*, that could explain why River was freaking-out -- she wasn't worried so much about the Doctor realising she was Amy's daughter, she was worried about him realising that she was the one that killed him.

Or, maybe she was just freaking out because it's *weird* -- she's his best mate's daughter, and he doesn't know, and they have this whole relationship, and she can't tell him about it because their timestream is so jacked-up.

Or, alternatively, perhaps she wasn't so much worried about telling him as she was about showing-up, because it could possibly have an effect on the space-time continuum -- her and her youngerself being in the same place at the same time. Of course, that rule has never held hard and fast in the Whoniverse.

You seem to struggle with your reading skills - I never claimed the article stated anything about global renewables deployment. It's simply general knowledge if you make an effort to educate yourself on this subject. It's very basic information.

Your beliefs are wrong and very ignorant - e.g. 

* “China’s wind power output rose more than 60 percent to 18.8 billion kilowatt-hours in the first quarter of 2011, growing 30 percent to 50 percent faster than the output of thermal power, hydropower and nuclear power in the same period...” http://cleantechnica.com/2011/06/01/china-wind-power-blowing-up-in-2011-as-expected/

Why are you making assertions when you clearly do not have a clue? Similarly you are clueless about the benefits of solar which do not need pumped storage to be realised until it reaches *very* high percentage of grid.

The Fires of Pompeii: Features Karen Gillan before she was Amy, and also gives some insight into the idea of whether or not time can be rewritten, which is definitely important

The Planet of the Ood: Gives more insight into the Ood which is important to stuff that happens later in that series that you MUST see

The Sontaran Stratagem/The Poison Sky: Features the return of Martha, although she makes me a bit angry in it

The Doctor's Daughter: Good fun and very interesting.

Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead: RIVER SONG. That is all.

Turn Left: Kind of an interesting episode, but not necessary to the overall story. If you like Rose she's in it.

The Stolen Earth/Journey's End: Features Martha and the return of Rose! Also further sets up the end of Ten.

Finally, there are four specials between series 4 and 5:

The Next Doctor: Great fun, not necessary, just fun

Planet of the Dead: Dumb, and totally unnecessary, skip it

Waters of Mars: Not fantastic, but the ending is glorious and terrifying and horrifying and just...see it

The End of Time 1 &amp; 2: Now if you care at all for Ten or loved the Master as I did, this is a must, as it features the inevitable and much-dreaded end of Ten, and the regeneration into Eleven.

As to your interpretation of the poem, I disagree. I know The Doctor isn't all good or all bad, etc. But, if you read the poem, the 'good man' is causing all of the bad things in the poem by going to war: night falling, dark rising, friendships dying, etc. All because a good man goes to war. The good man (The Doctor) in his desire to make the demons run, causes collateral damage like all of what you mentioned above and what the poem mentions. River is warning the good man/doctor not to go to war because of all the darkness it brings. It may make the demons run, but at what cost?

The Angels become Quantum Locked - which means that they can't move as long as they are observed.  It comes from quantum mechanics, and is based around the [uncertainty principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle), which says that you can know a particle's exact location, OR you can know it's velocity and trajectory, but you can never know both.  Observing the one will change the other (weird, like everything in quantum mechanics).

So, the substance of your post is correct, you just misstate it by saying the fact that ""they could be seen"" was the problem.  It's not whether or not they can be seen, it's whether or not they are being observed (because observing them changes their velocity and trajectory to zero).

I'd be interested in knowing how exactly the ""observation"" rule works.  Observing an image of them from a camera freezes them, so why doesn't observing them through a different medium?  Like ""I am observing them by listening"" - that obviously doesn't work, so I guess a blind person would be SOL.  Or an alien without eyes.  How about different spectrums of light?  Would Predator be ok, or SOL because he sees in infra red?  How about bats, which see through sonar?  Is it only when sentient beings observe them, or would they be frozen if, say, a goldfish saw them through it's tank?

It's been there staring us in the face since the ending credits of ""An Unearthly Child"". Why would he be named Who? He's so secretive about his name, that he chose this. If anyone comes close, probes his mind for it, or anything, all they're left with is the question ""Who?. In finding the answer, they're led to believe they haven't and so they ask ""Doctor Who?"".  For extra crazy fan points, the letters ""Theta Sigma"" can translate roughly to ""Who"" as well.

But no. That's always been, and still is, too obvious. Instead, I'd say we're thinking wrongly about what a weapon is. EPL said they want to stop the Doctor, not necessarily kill him. We also know that eventually the Doctor and River develop a romantic relationship. My guess is that EPL is specifically going to raise Melody into the kind of person that the Doctor would fall for. Mellow him out. Quell the fury of the Time Lord with love.

What I have come to expect from Moffat is that that his solution will make sense, and in retrospect there will have been clues, BUT not so many that it's easy to figure out, which is what I liked about ganger amy, among others. You suggested had there been more clues to ganger amy then the same thing would have happened as with the river reveal, and I totally agree. So maybe there shouldn't have been so many clues to river's identity, so that it would have had the same OMG value as the other reveals Moffat has done.

true,tommles,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt; Why didn't River know/remember Rory in Series 5?

It could possibly end up that River never meets her parents (or maybe just Rory), or it might be that she was pretending to maintain the time line.

&gt; Why did River seem so heartbroken when she saw him at the beginning of S06E07?

Bah...timey wimey. I want to say that if we go with the above then she recognizes Rory as her father from Amy telling her that he was the Last Centurion; however, I think this might only be acceptable if it is a pre-pandorica River. Other than that, it would be because she knew it was time for the Doctor's fall.

&gt; Why doesn't River acknowledge and/or remember being in the space suit?

She has to maintain the timeline.

&gt; Who was in the spacesuit when The Doctor was shot?

River. Melody. Flesh Doctor. Cyberman. Headless Monk. Obama.

&gt; Why does eyepatch lady need a Timelord baby?

She is upset that the Doctor blew up the ""Squareness gun"" factory and replaced it with a banana grove. My assumption is that it is a necessary means to fight the Doctor. It is possibly a necessary component for some method of time travel (if I remember correctly, only Time Lords were able to fly a TARDIS). It could be to simply fight fire with fire.

&gt; How exactly did the baby become part Timelord? (Will this be investigated further?)

From how I understand it, the time lords came into being partly because of prolonged exposure to the Untempered Schism. Therefore, it is possible that prolong exposure to the time vortex could alter Melody's DNA. The Doctor said it was not possible in the time frame; however, he did not take into account that Amy and Rory would not be using the bunk beds properly on their wedding night.

&gt; Who is Lorna (the lady that made the prayer leaf)?/What is her significance?

I assume that we meet her past self when the Doctor goes to Gamma Forest. She met the Doctor as a child and wanted to meet.

&gt; What is the significance of ""The Gamma Forests,"" their people, and their language?

We'll find out.

&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE FRIGGING DUCK POND?!

Cracks. It hasn't been brought up so I am going with the whole idea that they fell through cracks like everything else.

&gt; Oh, and who made the Tardis explode?

Who ever is in control of all the shenanigans.

As for the name, it was sown by Lorna into the fabric. If I remember correctly, she told Amy that was how Melody's name looks like in their language. So I think that means that Melody would translate to ""Song"" in their language. The English language is not lacking in redundancy. I want to think part of this has to do with diverse cultures. The people of Gamma Forest might not find it necessary to have multiple words meaning the same thing. As for the name swapping, it could be a cultural thing or it could be because ""Song River"" does not flow like ""River Song.""

So when this random girl in uniform showed up, mentioned that she met him briefly and that he was a warrior where she came from, it all sounded pretty consistent with that episode, just with different names. I suspected maybe she was a regenerated Jenny (and new actress) who had infiltrated the organization or something. The build-up really supported that mindset - I even thought she might regenerate at the end when she died.

Turned out Jenny was just the name of Madame Vastra's aid/companion. :P

Amy pond lives in a house wiht a crack in the wall.  The crack leads to a prison.  Prisoner Zero escapes and hijinx ensue.  

Amy+Rory sitting in a tardis... FU,,you get the point

amy gives birth to Melody Pond.

The baby is spirited away, presumably to earth where the silence raise it in the mental hospital.  it is for some reason fitted with a space suit

  after her escape from the silence, she gets sick and regenerates.

She spends some time amongst the Forest people They name her using their words and naming convention.  The doctor goes there and does some baddassery that make the name doctor mean great warrior

Someone in a space suit, that the doctor trusts, comes out of the lake and kills the doctor.

River Song goes to prison for killing a man, the best man she's ever known.

Then the doctor meets her for the first time, she dies and becomes a ghost in the library.

now, i put them in roughly the order thatI think they go.  Of course there are pieces missing and it's possible that some are out of order or wrong.

When Rassilon's rule over Gallifrey started to take a turn for the worse, The Other threw himself into the Loom (which would eventually reconstruct him).

true,tommles,tardis,TARDIS,"[Rassilon Imprimature](http://www.whoniverse.net/tardis/symbioticrelationship.php)

If I am understanding [tardis.wikia](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/TARDIS#Rassilon_Imprimatur) correctly. The Rassilon Imprimatur is required to enable a TARDIS to travel safely though the vortex. Once a TARDIS is primed then it can be used by any species. That can explain why River was capable of learning how the operate Sexy. As for having a finer control, if we assume that this is because of the Rassilon Imprimatur then that means that EPL &amp; co. would have to have somehow implanted it into Melody or it came about because of being conceived in the TARDIS. I know some people are theorizing the return of Omega. If this is the case, then it would be an explantion of how River could obtain the Rassilon Imprimatur. 

I do not know a lot on Classic Who to know if this is possible. Then of course there are the other sources that may or may not be considered canon. For example, the whoniverse link has a part that mentions that a TARDIS will begin to lose integrity if it travels back too far without a Time Lord pilot.

If we make the assumption that this idea is close to being correct then I would guess that the time machine(s) from the Lodger and IA/Day of the Moon might be making a re-appearance.  It seems that most [time travel devices](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Time_travel#Other_Technological_Means) are crude in comparison the a TARDIS. If they are wanting to use Melody as a weapon and she does have the capability of the Rassilon Imprimatur then she could possibly be used to prime them for safe travel.

I think the simplest answer is that ""the TARDIS figures it out."" Our reference of time is based off the distance between the Earth and the sun. Revolutions, rotations, and so on. Therefore, if the TARDIS happens to be in Alpha Centauri time cannot be measured using the same time reference. I would assume that on board the TARDIS, time mechanisms would be sophisticated enough to automatically calculate time based on its spacial location. Again, not much of a physicist so I might be wrong on some parts.

As for the calculation of years, the TARDIS never really stays in place long enough. I would assume that a companion would most likely continue to measure time based on their original point of reference (Earth). For the most part, I think the show does not get into specifics (you can travel all of Time and Space why keep track). They might travel to year 1969. Day turns into night and night into day.

true,Atman00,null,null,"&gt;Why didn't River know/remember Rory in Series 5?

He had been erased from the universe.

&gt;Why did River seem so heartbroken when she saw Rory at the beginning of S06E07?

Perhaps from her perspective she hadn't seen him in a long time.  My own prediction is that Rory is the good man she'll kill.  

&gt;Why doesn't River acknowledge and/or remember being in the space suit?

There's a decent chance that the child in the space suit from Impossible Astronaut is not actually River, but in fact the child of River and the Doctor.  A good argument is made [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/hrmmm/a_good_man_goes_to_war_discussion_definite/c1xst7b)

&gt;How exactly did the baby become part Timelord? (Will this be investigated further?)

Technically, she's not part Time Lord;  Over millenia, the inhabitants of Gallifrey mutated into Time Lords as a result of exposure to the energy of the Time Vortex.  River is still human, but her DNA has mutated in a similar way.  Her conception occurred while the TARDIS was inside the Time Vortex, which is why this happened.

&gt;Why does eyepatch lady need a Timelord baby?

The implication is that the child is going to be used as a weapon against the Doctor.  I'm sure we'll learn plenty on this later.

&gt;Who is Lorna (the lady that made the prayer leaf)?/What is her significance?
&gt;What is the significance of ""The Gamma Forests,"" their people, and their language?

The emotional arc of this episode is the Doctor struggling with everyone in the cosmos viewing him as a weapon, and a warrior, and all of these things that he hates. That the *word* doctor means great warrior to them is incredibly hard for him.. The Doctor is realizing that he is his own ideological opposite, that his legacy is not one of healing and helping, but of war and fear and death.

The character of Lorna had two purposes; one was to set up the River Song/Melody Pond wordplay, and the other was to push that theme of the unwitting Warrior Doctor. 

&gt;WHAT ABOUT THE FRIGGING DUCK POND?!

The ducks in the duck pond were erased from the universe by the cracks last season.  A trace of them still remains, however, in the form of the duckpond.  This was the Doctor's first clue to the existence of the cracks in the universe, and things being unwritten from history.

&gt;River said that the people of the Gamma Forests didn't have a word for ""Pond"" because the only water in the forest is the river, so Melody Pond was loosely translated, coming out as River Song. My question is, why was ""Melody"" changed to Song (it was not stated that they didn't have a word for Melody), and why were the positions of the names flopped (translated, the name should have come out to Song River)? Was the further meddling of the names River's doing, to hide her identity, or was it all still because of the translation?

Most languages are not as synonym rich as English.  It was significant with Pond/River, as these are very distinct concepts.  Melody and Song, however, are fairly similar, and it's easy to see why they would translate the way they did.

As to the transliteration, the cloth was embroidered one word on each side, so there was no way to know which was first or last.  Also, well, everybody already knows that the kid will go by River Song in the future, so they call her that.",0,1307257946,null,0,false,0,c1xv2se,t3_hrwdk,t1_c1xv2se,t3_hrwdk,1427213746,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

If we had RTD back then every male character would either be gay or bisexual, and every female character would be wanting to jump on the Doctor or Jack even though they have a boyfriend back home. Oh wait, that is empowering women so they're nothing wrong with that.



Seriously though. Is it horrible that Amy was kidnapped? Yes. Is it horrible that she had little realization of her pregnancy? Yes. But, if you remove the comical aspects of Doctor Who you can begin to see more of the mature aspects that are being discussed. In fact, if done properly there is a lot of things that can be discussed through Doctor Who. We are in a time when homosexuality is more out in the open yet still frowned upon. RTD created a great character who happens to be a bit more flexible in dancing. Life, death, war, genocide. Even small social aspects like jealousy and family values.

Whether River thinks Melody Pond is her slave name is actually irrelevant. She couldn't spoil who she was for the Doctor or her parents before her existence was a done deal in their own timelines, as it might cause her to not exist. 

I still think the whole ""good man"" thing is a red herring and will turn out to be someone who isn't Rory or The Doctor.

Starting to think after watching today's ep again that we're pretty much done with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Pond and are now going to see the TARDIS crewed by the Doctor and River as he teaches her how to and not to interact with the timeline. Hence ""Let's Kill Hitler"". (I have an uneasy feeling that this is either all too correct or I'm wayyyyy off.) As a complete sidenote to this, I used to dread them ever showing the Doctor's time with River onscreen but I'm actually psyched to see it now, if it turns out to be what's ahead.

When he is traveling into the distant past and future with human companions, the Doctor usually refers to the time in ""years in your future"". Meaning earth years. Especially when it comes to specific dates in the context of human colonies.

In the episode ""The Doctor's Daughter"", they used some kind of calendar system to tell year/month/day, but it way the Doctor didn't immediately recognize (he did know the name, and said it, but I cba to look it up), which means there are probably several different systems of telling time.

I think the doctor has a pretty good knowledge of history (both past and future history), and he does generally pick the destination. So maybe he does a little math in his head. Something like (well, this would be year *x* in Gallifreyan, so that would mean year *y* in Standard Earth Calendar, minus about 2000 years makes it *z* years in the companion's future (assuming she was from around 2000).

The people whose lives he touches end up flinging themselves bodily at whatever injustice or evil they encounter, but because they're *not* the Doctor, not brilliant and, let's face it, not freaking *immortal,* their bodies crumple and they fall until only the Doctor is left, having somehow to cope with the knowledge that it's all his fault.

And yet at the same time, he's *lonely.* He's got the whole expanse of time and space right outside his front door, but it's pointless and tiresome without someone to share it with. So time and again he's drawn back to finding a best friend, someone to keep him company, someone to act as his eyes so he can feel wonder again … until he turns *them* into warriors too, and everything has to change.

So, if we have a triumvirate of Eyepatch Lady + Headless Monks + ??? which has gathered to kill The Doctor (yes, I know that the triumvirate was not the same as the conspirators in the play), Amy or another Marc Antony stand-in would turn the triumvirate's army in the Doctor's favour.

We know River and Melody are the same person. But I think Lorna is also the same person. She may regenerate at some point after she dies that we and the main characters don't see.

She is the one that essentially gives River her name in a way. She's from the Gamma Forest and has met the doctor before. Perhaps the Gamma Forest is where she was hidden to stay safe from the Church and being used as a weapon.

When Amy was talking to Melody and going on, Lorna was crying as if she knew these words or somehow related to them.

Amy also told Melody to be very brave. When Lorna died, the Doctor asked ""Who was she?"" and the answer was ""I don't know but she was very brave"". Specific keywords like this seems to be a trend in the show. e.g. ""A good man"".

The Doctor and her will be running through the forest.

I'm not trying to trash him, he's good at fitting a watchable story into the miniscule 43 minutes per episode they allow. But I really have to consciously ignore all the holes in many of the shows. It's clear also that this new generation of Who is a designed thing, intended to weave hooks into everything to keep the audience throughout the series. But for me it's like Lost meets Dr Who this season. If the baby was Flesh, then why did Madame Pirate-Patch want to bother taking it with her when she escaped? And why bother to disintegrate it after she left?

I was wondering whether the big end idea is not the baby as a weapon but that Omega is trying to come back from the antimatter universe he was last left in many years ago in the series, and needs a Time-Lord regenerate-able body to transfer into. So he sets up a corps (the ones with the omega symbol!) to obtain an infant body infused with Time Helix energy. Perhaps Melody, but since Melody grows up to be River, we know that can't be. Or maybe it can be, but Omega gets defeated and then River goes on with her life.

I wouldn't be surprised if Amy is actually the daughter of the Doctor and River, even though that would make Melody, who IS River, her own mother's mother.

Other seasons of Who would finish with the main conflict after the last episode, and start with a wholly new one unrelated to the previous. Moffat is telling the story of Amy right now, and based on some rumors I've heard, it may be concluding by the end of this season. 

And your other complaints are fairly baseless. The doctor has only switched universes during the Rose debacle, not with Moffat. The past episode explained WHY these aliens who normally try to kill the doctor are helping him with the battle. Also, you said the dialog was cliche, not the characters, which are two completely different things. 

Not liking Amy and Rory is fine though, I can't fault you for that (I only mildly like them, personally). But you should keep in mind that Moffat is telling their story during these seasons, so if you don't like their story then just wait till after it ends to watch it. 

On a side note, my biggest problem with Moffat is how he breaks many of the ""rules"" established in the previous seasons for what the doctor can and can't do relative to space/time.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The judge's decision rests on an assessment by the psychiatrist at the Homerton hospital that Joe was not suffering from a mental illness at the time of the arson attack. His mother is bemused by that assessment, given that he had so recently been sectioned for a 28-day assessment period, and she remains unclear about how doctors came to this conclusion. Although the doctor concluded that Paraskeva was not unwell, he also concluded that he was not dangerous. The judge's decision that he did pose a risk to the public, warranting an IPP, was based on a risk assessment compiled by a probation officer who had not met Paraskeva. The probation officer's analysis was formed by inputting facts about the case and Paraskeva's background into a computerised risk-analysis system, which crunched the data through complex algorithms and categorised him as dangerous. The case has triggered unease among mental health campaigners.
&gt;Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of Sane, says: ""In our view this case is cruel and inhumane, yet sadly this happens all too often. There are 70% of prisoners who have two or more psychiatric conditions. Sane questions why a young man who is known to suffer from a serious mental illness should be taken to prison where, because of the IPP, he could be detained for many years.

I'm sorry the guy has had a hard time but let's be real, he clearly has some serious issues, even when he is doing well he is an arsonist with a poor understanding of the consequences of his actions.

It's not *nice* that he is in prison on an indeterminate sentence but he is dangerous so unfair as it may be, the rest of us have more right to be safe than he has to be free.

I'm not saying our system is perfect and I find it concerning that a computer makes these decisions but then if we are applying fixed criteria rather than personal judgement it does make more sense to do it that way.

You really need to learn a few basics. Here's a starter:

* Lifecycle CO2 emissions g / kWh: wind = 10, hydroelectricity = 13, solar thermal = 13, solar photovoltaic = 32, biomass = 14 - 41, nuclear = 66, natural gas = 443, coal = 1050. http://i.imgur.com/NIMaW.png + http://www.nirs.org/climate/background/sovacool_nuclear_ghg.pdf + http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0810/full/climate.2008.99.html

Add in to that the fact that it takes 10+ years to deploy each nuke and you should be able to work out the problem.

The plain fact is that nukes are going nowhere fast, renewables are being deployed at an exponential rate. The end result is obvious to anyone who isn't a blind wingnut!

By one on one tutorship I assume you mean supervisions? In my subject, (NatSci at Cambridge) are actually usually two-to-three to one and they fucking rock. Seriously, most of your learning will come from doing the assigned work for a supervision and then having your supervisor (usually an enormously intelligent guy) run over it with you. I have four one-hour supervisions a week and 90% of my learning comes from these.

* It's a bit tricky to explain the college system to someone who doesn't go there, but at the end of the day they're basically just where you live. A few of them have a bias towards a certain subject but all of them have a mixture of different subjects studied. In general, people choose one by looking at the location, building or demographic they like. Personally, I chose mine because of the demographic (low privvy intake, a good variety of subjects studied and a fairly equal gender ratio) and ease of getting in. Everyone ends up loving their college in the end.

* I guess so, but the teaching here is really great. Being able to talk face to face with an expert in their field several times a week is pretty hard to match.

* There's a billion things I could say but I should really be studying right now. If you're planning on applying PM me and I'll get back to you with some tips when I have the time.

Hope this helps.

I love it, really--all of my supervisors are people who not only want to teach (generally you don't supervise unless you want to, it's expensive) but are doing research on their own things, which is great. It's a bit daunting, having your piddling essays read by these people who have worked in the field for years and have made a name for themselves in it, but it really is fantastic.

* No, as Nozkin said, colleges really are essentially just where you live. People tend to pick colleges based on size or location or other demographic things, not so much on the subject. Everyone loves their colleges, even if they ended up there by chance. The only way your college choice affects your subject is that your Director of Studies arranges who you're supervised by.

* Probably, but I can't really say, not having had experience of any other unis. From what I hear and what the hype is, Oxbridge students do genuinely get pushed harder--I've gotten used to my workload, but during term time I generally have two 2,000-word essays to write per week, on subjects I haven't learned before and have to research. I don't know what the workload is at other unis, so I can't say.

So what if it's based in Bloomsbury and costs 18k? I believe they subsidise a fifth of applicants. And I think that a graduate of this University will be able to get a job that pays higher than the average graduate salary - provided the University follows through on rigorous selection and keeps their highly acclaimed academic staff. I think in this scenario the 18k is justifiable. Additionally, one would be able to make some great connections during their time there, thereby helping future prospects along.

Here is the paste from the thread to make it easier :)

&gt;My theory:

&gt;We know River and Melody are the same person. But I think Lorna is also the same person. She may regenerate at some point after she dies that we and the main characters don't see.

&gt;She is the one that essentially gives River her name in a way. She's from the Gamma Forest and has met the doctor before. Perhaps the Gamma Forest is where she was hidden to stay safe from the Church and being used as a weapon.

&gt;When Amy was talking to Melody and going on, Lorna was crying as if she knew these words or somehow related to them.

&gt;Amy also told Melody to be very brave. When Lorna died, the Doctor asked ""Who was she?"" and the answer was ""I don't know but she was very brave"". Specific keywords like this seems to be a trend in the show. e.g. ""A good man"".

&gt;The Doctor and Lorna will be running through the forest. Doctor will know he needs to save her and and they run from whatever it is that's after her.

true,Blerrie,null,null,"* One on one tutorship: I am a PhD student, and the tutorship applies to undergratuade and taught courses. However, the standard is usually pretty high. Its up to the Directors of Studies (DoS) of various subjects in Colleges to arrange supervisors. I have heard of some questionable supervisions/supervisors, but this is almost always a reflection of questionable DoS's. Mostly, however, the system is incredibly effective. Expensive, but effective. And btw, not all supervisions are one-on-one - groups of 2-4 are very common. All of this being said, I have a great time in my institute, and have ample opportunity to see my PhD supervisor, who is a leader in his field.

* The Collegiate system is a rather expensive system that provides the opportunity for small group tuition. The Colleges themselves provide a place to stay, food to eat, social interaction, etc., as well as pastoral care. To study at Cambridge University, you must be a member of a College; for graduates, you must apply first to a department and the BGS, as an undergrad, you apply to a college (you list them, if I understand correctly). I have made good friendships in my department, but also at college. My college friends have a wide range of academic interests. As a graduate, I have to say that the best thing about College life is that you are forced to interact with very gifted people that study things you know nothing about - it provides an intellectual atmosphere that really motivates me to learn more not only about my subject, but others as well.

* Its the intellectual resources, both human and material, that attract graduates to Oxbridge (I won't speak for undergrads). I have heard of temperamental researchers who are shit teachers, and horror stories of famous academics who pretty much neglect their students; however, as research goes, the best of the best are employed. I am very lucky in that I have a good relationship and plenty of access to my supervisor.

* Something people get wrong: thinking that the grads are a bunch of toffs, and are pretty much the same as the undergrad community. I have met some very uppity grads, but uppity undergrads far outnumber them. Contrary to popular opinion, to be a graduate at Cambridge does not mean that you come from a rich family, went to a private school, spend your weekends punting, take skiing/boozing holidays, or buy £500 suits to go to May Balls. Not that there aren't grads that do this - its just that your average grad is not your average undergrad. I had a friend's working class parents turn their noses up at me for ages, thinking I was a wealthy Oxbridge toff, but in actual fact I worked my arse off to get a place and decent funding. 

Of course, the stereotype doesn't apply to all undergrads. But I have to admit, the first serious snobs I came across were in a largely-undergrad society I joined.

* Assume by ""one-on-one tutorship"" you mean the tutorial system? (Or whatever they call it Cambridge, I guess.) Tutorials are pretty much the best part, academically speaking, of being at Oxford. Mine aren't one-on-one, but two or three students to the one tutor, which is about the right number - you get individual attention, but also feel a bit less on-the-spot. Tutorials give you motivation to do the work regularly, and mean there is always an opportunity to have trickier things explained to you at your pace.

Each college will have a number of tutors in different subjects associated with the college, and a number of places avaliable to study those subjects there. For example, Oriel College has about 4 places for CompSci per year. College is your home, the people you live with and have fun with (but ofc you're not restricted to socialising within college)

* I have no experience of universities other than Oxford, but I wouldn't say that Oxbridge is the only way to get a high-level education in a subject. Yes, the tutorial system is great, and yes Oxbridge is a high standard education, but other universities also have excellent courses. Oxbridge just has the advantage of being old and established. (and amazing. But I'm slightly biased there ;) )

* Where can I start? We're not all loaded, we don't spend all our time locked away in the library, we don't wear sub fusc (the official academic dress) every day (though we do have to wear it for exams). Some of us don't have a clue what's going on with the rowing. Interviews aren't designed to trip you up (but they're not ""just like tutes"", either. Far less pressure in tutes.) Anything more specific you want to know?

true,friendlyhumanist,k9,K-9,"I have some questions about ""Good Man"" too, and I'm not sure where to put them, but this might work...?

1. How did they fit planes through the Tardis door? (I've seen this asked, but not answered, elsewhere).

2. I think it's somewhat clear that ""Melody Pond"" became ""River Song"" because (a) whoever told River her name as a child took her name from Leona's leaf, (b) they translated ""Melody"" to ""Song"" and ""Pond"" to ""River,"" and (c) they didn't know what order the words went in because Leona's leaf didn't indicate the order. But if Amy has the leaf, how does all that happen? Will we see the leaf change hands later? (Seems unlikely to me... why would that even happen?) Or did Eyepatch Lady and the Clerics already make all those errors?

3. Assuming the clerics here are the same clerics as in ""Flesh and Stone,"" etc., why would Fr. Octavian &amp; co. lock River up for killing ""the best man she ever knew"" if that was the clerics' whole plan? Remember, Fr. Octavian explicitly said she was locked up for killing a man (I'm like 90% on this, just watched it the other day), not for anything else she did (i.e. rebelling against the clerics). It wouldn't make sense for the clerics to lock her up in Stormcage for killing the Doctor (or Rory, etc.), and it would seem odd and rather droll if she was locked up for killing someone else. (So that at the end of ""Flesh and Stone"" when the Doctor asks her who she killed, trying to figure out why she was locked up, she answers with ""I wasn't locked up for this, but by the by I did kill the best man I ever knew."")

3a. I guess we can just assume that by the time ""Flesh and Stone"" rolls around, the Clerics are cool with the Doctor, and were willing to take the chance that River's ""he'll show up in a museum eventually"" plan to find him wouldn't catch a Doctor that was pissed at the clerics. Still, it's odd. Right?
EDIT: They did say to River ""you promised me an army."" So they didn't know she was getting the Doctor, but they also didn't seem that concerned about him. Maybe Fr. Octavian was too low on the totem pole to know about the huge plan executed (river's age then) years ago, but not so low that they weren't willing to send him to stop a Weeping Angel? Plus, why did River think the clerics would be okay seeing the doctor?

If you're fantastic at self-directed study and can get by in a subject on vague notes and time in the library, then you'll get by - although personally I think if this is the case, why bother going to University? If you prefer somewhere you can actually ask questions to clarify the material then you'll have problems. The first thing to know about lectures is that they'll be held with *hundreds* of other students, so there's not much opportunity to discuss the material, just take notes.

* I never had one on one tutorship. As a Natsci I had tutorials once a week with a couple of other people and a PhD student - they lasted about an hour or so and were never enough to cover the material that we'd been trying to learn.

* Colleges are really just a place to live, along with a sort of tribal mentality. They do have some different resources in terms of libraries and tutors, but that's about all.

* This kind of thinking really irks me. Personally, I think you could get a much better education anywhere else. The reason you tend to get good people coming out of Cambridge is because it attracts that kind of person in the first place.

Things you may not know, or have realised :

* Oxbridge terms are 2 weeks shorter (iirc) than other universities - this means less time to learn *and* less time for fun!
* Entirely because of the collegiate system, Cambridge is enormous. In the more popular subjects you'll be sharing resources with hundreds, possibly thousands of other students.
* Cambridge DOES NOT CARE about students. They're money in the bank, that's all. It's a better place for research, I'm told, but as a student you are pond scum.

Unless you're a genius, you might prefer being a big fish in a smaller pond.

true,namesaremptynoise,mccoy,McCoy,"1. No, that is not the goal.  It happened, travellers in the TARDIS saw it happen, they're not allowed to go back and change it.  The goal is probably a lot more complicated than that(The Doctor has to find a way to survive the event that still allows it to play out exactly as the others witnessed it), and there's the fact that after the hit, Melody/River is still out wandering, alone through space/time.  Also, you're forgetting the fact that we never actually SAW mini-River/Melody in the suit when the Doctor was shot, only afterward, in another time and another place.  That's not something you should let slip your mind as you're trying to figure all this out.

2. Speak for yourself on that 'we're all in agreeance.'  Moffat's fooled me pretty hard a few times already on things I thought were obvious, don't take anything for granted.  It could be that somebody found out that she'd 'killed' the Doctor and that's enough to get her life imprisonment, for instance.

3. We'll have to watch and find out.  I doubt their travels are done though.

4. Why would she change her name?  ""Spoileeeers!"" of course.  If she introduced herself as Melody Pond, it'd kind of be a giveaway.

I doubt apathy and frustration are what Moffat is going for in his writing. When you focus too much on shocking the spoiler-philes and playing up visual effects to the detriment of plot and character integrity, the magic of Doctor Who is lost. I think that's what has been happening a little bit in recent episodes.


Furthermore, while I admire what he's doing with a long, overarching plot arc, it is coming at the expense of certain episodes. There shouldn't ever be ""filler"" episodes in Doctor Who, yet that's what is happening; in order to drag out the arc, we get episodes (like the pirates) where nothing really happens, and little clues are scattered, and instead of having an episode that is excellent in its own right, the viewers are left unsatisfied. It's like they've been thrown a few crumbs instead of getting a nice slice of chocolate cake.

""Agree with this. The reason City, United, Liverpool, England have taken notice of Henderson is his natural ability on and of the ball. Even though Capello speaks shocking English his 'he only ever takes one touch, two at most' comment is 100% spot on. Anyone with even the smallest idea about football can spot a player; A footballer who is 2 seconds ahead of what's about to happen. And that of course is why the big clubs want him. If you've got the brain and you've got the touch at 19/20, the potential is enormous.

DRR says ""...We get that word from you, you know. But if you carry on the way you are, what might that word come to mean?"" This is language in the future tense which is then followed by a past tense reference to the Gamma Forest people. I get the implication from Lorna Bucket death scene that The Doctor hasn't met her yet (but lies about it to her) and that the Gamma Forest event is to happen in his future timeline. Given the Gamma Forestians call him a warrior, again I take the implication that this will take place during his fall. I think DRR's speech is the plateau point warning him subtly of what is to come.

&gt; you can't interact with your own past.

Possibly this is a fixed point in time for River's personal timeline, and maybe everyone else in Chez Tardis. If they had managed to save the baby then perhaps she would never have become River Song and just remained normal old Melody Pond living back on Earth with a settled down Amy &amp; Rory

There are 2 pained reactions on SCR's face though. First when she realises that it's Rory in the Roman getup then after she checks her 500 Year Diary and confirms to herself that the events are Demon's Run (combined with a melancholy soundtrack sting). She also says ""I'm from his future, I always know""

She can (and does, frequently) leave the prison any time she wants. But she keeps coming back, probably out of a sense of guilt or obligation.

As a child she is being raised as a weapon to be used against the Doctor. So yeah, spacesuit stuff included, she probably kills the Doctor.

In my opinion she would kill only Rory if he sacrificed himself to save the Doctor, which doesn't seems likely, or by accident.

For the show to continue, however, the Doctor (not the flesh Doctor) has to live. We've seen *a* Doctor get shot, start regenerating, get shot again, then his body burned.


To me there are 2 options.

* That was a flesh copy.

This seems like too much of a cop-out.

* That was the real Doctor. 

If that's the case, and the show is to continue, time has to be rewritten. This would certainly cause a paradox, which may be sufficient cause for the Tardis to explode.

I wasn't going to attempt to respond to your post; however, in reading it I took issue with your question on whether you could ""still become well education on a subject to the same standard as those who go to Oxbridge without studying there..."".

I believe that it's often forgotten that Oxbridge produces many of the most successful and intelligent graduates largely because it *admits* many of the most successful and intelligent prospective students.  An academically-able individual could definitely fulfil his/her potential at many of the decent universities in the UK and emerge with the skills that will enable him/her to achieve just as much as any good Oxbridge graduate, providing they have the drive and ambition.

While Oxford and Cambridge are home to a higher proportion of world-leading academics than any other UK university, and provide an unrivalled tutorial teaching system, such features are not essential to developing a deep knowledge and understanding of a subject.  Indeed, they may inspire a student or help him/her to grasp a particular concept more easily and thoroughly; however, with the right determination and attitude, a student at another university can become just as indulged in his/her subject.

Oxford and Cambridge are undoubtedly excellent universities at which to study, but at the same time, an intelligent person should be successful regardless of the academic institution they attend.  My father told me that he met many people at Cambridge whom he wouldn't deem to be especially intelligent -- they didn't do well as a result; likewise he knew friends at other universities whose intelligence, diligence, and interest in their subjects allowed them to succeed in their degrees and have very successful careers.

Remember, not all of the of the smartest people go to Oxford or Cambridge.

This means that while the genetic looms (from Lungbarrow) may be canon, they are most likely not. The doctor himself talks about being a child, and ""Playing on his father's estate"". However, in Lungbarrow, the book states that Gallifreyans were born as ""full-grown adults"". The master, too, is shown as a -child- and not as a full-grown adult with the mind of a child.

Definitely not a bad question, but I'd assumed it was one of those time causality loop things where her entire family knows she's called River Song as an adult, so she ends up being called River Song as an adult.

&gt;Also, if you want to think meta on the writing, you have to ask why the Gamma Forest is used as an example for 'the doctor' meaning 'great warrior'. There are plenty of examples which could be used, that could have been more relevant to what the viewers have seen in the past, which would have taken less work to achieve a greater ""thematic"" result.

I disagree that it would have achieved a greater result.  It's much more effective for themes to be pulled form stories built up in the present episode, not just referenced.

Lorna came in search of the Doctor, she was the one who showed empathy to Amy, who realized what the Clerics were doing was wrong.  This goodness couldn't have come from her one word encounter with the Doctor, it came from her people. 

We aren't told a lot about the Gamma Forests, but what we do learn paints a great picture.  Gamma Forests are neutral in the war.  She calls Gamma Forest a boring place, where 30 seconds of the Doctor is the only interesting thing to ever happen.  Basically, a *peaceful* place.  Even the name conjures up a rather idyllic setting.  Basically, Lorna and her people are the only grounding of peace in this episode, of ideals the Doctor strives for.  *Every* other character, every conversation, every scene in the entire episode revolves around violence.  And *those* are the people whose word for warrior is doctor.  That's so much more effective than any reference they could make.

There was also another way this episode built the theme of the Doctor's legacy of violence, and that was through his companions.  Most of the people we saw were indebted to him;  This was their penance and redemption.  Lorna is important because she was the companion he *didn't* recruit.  She sought him out.  The Doctor crashed on her world and said *one word* to her.  His encouter was as fleeting as it gets.  Probably a fairly boring day for the Doctor, not even worth telling to us; and from *this*, he inadvertently turned her into a weapon and got her killed.  I can't think of a more effective way to build this theme than that.",0,1307310843,null,0,false,0,c1xye61,t3_hrw63,t1_c1xye61,t1_c1xwoc0,1427215383,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Each college has its own character and a different social mix and attitudes. I went to King's College which is very political and has a far higher proportion of state school students but totally uninterested in sport as anything other than fun, each one has a different feel to it. They're also a great social base as you make friends mixing within your college with people from lots of different subjects as well as meeting people on your course and generally. Each college is moderately independent with its own library, facilities, student bar, events and so on, it's its own mini-university where many of the fellows (academics) and students eat together in the main hall.

Of course you can be well educated elsewhere though the Oxbridge courses tend to go further and have more material and you'll be mixing with some of the very smartest academics doing cutting edge work. You also gain a lot from the other students as quite a few of them are scarily smart.

Tutorship (as in the 'supervision' system) can be a really mixed bag, but in my experience, it has been on the whole pretty darn excellent. They've really helped me grasp difficult concepts which I didn't originally understand in lectures or reading. Having a good supervision provides more benefit to your learning in an hour than you could ever do by yourself. I've never had one-on-one before, it's always been 2-4 people.

Colleges are mainly residential and recreational spaces. Where you sleep, eat, socialise, work, join groups etc. It has relatively little to do with the academic side of things, although it does vary between subject and year. The college system just provides another layer of opportunities for sport, politics, friends etc. There's a lot to do in college, but it's always healthy to get out and join societies outside too. Facilities, accommodation, food, atmosphere all vary between colleges. 

Yeah, of course you could become just as well educated (even more so) at universities outside of Oxbridge, but the supervision system, as the main differentiating factor from other universities, provides an extra supplementary aspect to learning which other universities lack. Courses here are intensive and involved, but if you can embrace it, then the rewards are great. It's not for everyone, and it doesn't mean that people who don't enjoy or succeed with it are any worse at the subject or of lesser ability; the style just doesn't suit some people.

People still think it's full of toffs unfortunately. As a state-educated Northener from a low-income background and in receipt of all the means-tested bursaries on offer, and one who's absolutely loving every minute of my time here, nothing annoys me more than people who say that my situation is impossible. Yes there are outdated institutions and practices, yes there might be a few more stereotypical posh-toff types here than at most other universities, but that doesn't make it a bad place and it doesn't make them bad people. One of the other things that people don't realise is how cheap Cambridge can be compared to elsewhere. The bursary system is incredible, and it's meant I can be here without having to worry about finances, whereas it would have been a different situation elsewhere.
