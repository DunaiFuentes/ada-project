Bus you could get by far the cheapest, I got a Megabus to London from Glasgow for ¬£9 once but it was overnight and took about 13 hours. If you are pressed for time I doubt bus will be much use to you.

Flying is obviously quickest, not much more than an hour in-flight I think but you've got to get to the airport early and don't forget airports aren't central. You'll have to add the cost and hassle of travel to and from the airport. When checking flight prices to London check which airport it is going to and then check their website, they will have services to the city centre with prices too. Flying will still be quicker overall though and similar in price to train in the end.

Train is about 5 hours but it leaves centrally and arrives centrally too so would be least hassle for you. I prefer train because I find it really relaxing and you'd get to see a bit of scenery too, some of the East Coast line is beautiful.

Will you be returning to Edinburgh? There is a skill to British Rail travel if you really want cheap tickets so let us know if you think rail is for you :)

Looking ahead to the beginning of June the cheapest is ¬£36. 

Their websites only give their own fares, but nationalrail.co.uk gives both and then directs you to the individual company's site to buy. East Coast have a web discount. There can be some bargains to be had with the advanced tickets but there are certain other tricks to getting cheaper tickets - splitting tickets and going slower indirect routes but it's fairly complicated.

As for hotels in London, the cheapest places that aren't hostels are the budget hotel chains like Travelodge.

Based on the official trailer I'm speculating that #5 is [includes that creppy thing that makes tally marks on your skin](/spoiler)

Based on official casting announcements I think #3 [might be the return of Craig Owen after all he did have big black spot on his ceiling](/spoiler). Though that may be stretching it.

Still don't think River is the person the Doctor marries in #4. This episode was moved up from it's original position where the Lodger was aired in series 5. Would be strange to have River marry the Doctor right before going into the Pandorica Opens/Big Bang two parter. But with all the wibby wobbly who knows.

I wonder if the ""good man"" in #7 is the same one River says she killed at the end of the Angels two-parter in season 5.

**Canon**:  
Happened in the TV Series/Specials fully produced by the BBC or was promoted to being canon by being referenced by the TV series (this is how the 96 movie &amp; Paul McGann Doctor has been made full canon, his face has appeared in such episodes as ""the next doctor"" and ""the eleventh hour"" when reviewing past doctors, there was a LOT of debate before this that the 96 movie wasn't canon at all).

**Soft-Canon**:  
BBC Authorised stories in the form of novels, comics, audio productions, etc. Soft canon is ""considered canon until the TV series decides it isn't"". As in, yes, it can be said that it is true, but if a new episode wishes to make a plot point or reference that contradicts it then the TV show takes priority and the ""Soft-Canon"" is no longer regarded as having happened.

**Fannon**:

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"Eugh. 6 reasons? Point 2 and 3 could be 1 point. Hell, the article title says there is 6 reasons but then states there is 5. Pedantic, I know, but sloppy. I also don't see what this has to do with America at all. Anyway, moving on:

Point 1 - Monarchy as the enemy of democracy. Okay, perhaps, but this article paints the republic movement as a huge movement; personally I don't think anyone gives a damn. Just because someone doesn't care about the royal wedding doesn't mean they oppose the monarchy. They genuinely are indifferent; republic or constitutional monarchy, neither would impact their daily routine. I don't think there's any weight behind the claim that the monarchy is stopping democracy either. The author more or less states that the crown is effectively beneath parliament in terms of power. Thus it isn't the monarchy that's the problem; it's the people running the country. 

Point 2 (and 3) - the author more or less states they are American. As such, they go on to essentially make out that the Royal Wedding is costing money and should be opposed on that basis. I would be inclined to feel there is an agenda here, to have an American journalist to start commenting on the Royal Wedding whilst in the article title linking both America and Britain suggests it.

Points 4 and 5 are more or less equally the same thing. Journalists across the world are being reassigned to cover the royal wedding. Not really significant, given the large number of journalists out there. We only need so many reporters covering a story, else you get about 300,000 versions of the same event. News is, at the end of the day, news. Natural disasters, royal weddings, outbreaks of diseases, political events, etc. etc. - everything is equally news. Some of it seems less relevant than others, but the purpose is to keep people informed.

The last point I would say more or less demonstrates what the author wants. Her opposition to the royal wedding on the grounds of money and priveledge, to me, suggests she is making a parallel to the pro-corporation moves in the US. The rich benefitting from the hardships of the poor, more or less, and the personification of the Royal Family as the rich and the taxpayer facing the cuts as the poor just seems to be an extrapolation of events in the US.

Yes, the may 5th referendum is the reason I made these two videos.

&gt;Edit: I would like to add a fourth question if I may. This may be a very stupid question but how would this work with selecting your local MP?

This is the important point: **I've dodged an issue in my videos**.  That is the difference between electing a representative body, such as a parliament, and electing a single representative, such as a president.

AV is a pretty good (though not the best) method of electing a single winner (president) but it's not a proportional method that works well in a representative body.  

In the UK, the plan is to keep the [local constituencies](http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/downloads/PCON_MAY_2010_GB_MP_rast.pdf) as they are.  Each constituency will run an AV election to select its member of parliament.  This will illuminate the spoiler effect in those constituencies, but it won't make parliament (much) more proportional.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I don't know if this is going to help:  

We effectively have three political parties (plus a load of other small ones led by the Green party) in England, plus a couple of equivalents to the big parties in Scotland, NI and Wales.

In most cases the MPs are elected in their constituency are effectively in a two horse race - whether that be Labour v Conservative, Lib Dem v Conservative or Lib Dem v Labour.  In virtually all instances where it appears to be a two horse race, the third party is also standing (plus many of the minor ones).  In FPTP most people don't vote for the third party (or the minor ones), because they don't think they'll win, so they choose one of the other two (or don't vote).

In AV the voter has the choice of voting for their preferred candidate first, their second as number two and so on.  They can choose not to vote for one party.  In situations where Conservatives got 49% vote, Labour 40% and Lib Dem 11% at the moment the Conservatives would win the seat.  In an AV system it's possible that Labour could win if all the Lib Dem voters put their vote to Labour.  In the last election only 219 of the 650 MPs got more than 50% of the vote.

[Ed Miliband winning the Labour leadership race is a good example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_\(UK\)_leadership_election,_2010).  In a FPTP system David Miliband would have won because he had 37% of the vote.

Your question of why we wouldn't still end up with a two party system is that we don't really have one at the moment - the lib dems get 20% of the vote and the conservatives don't have any seats in Scotland, NI or Wales.  The AV system should encourage people to vote for who they want to win, followed by voting against who they don't want to win. 

EDIT: I'm just going to edit this one to a question I've seen you ask somewhere else :)

In a situation where you are only voting for one position (eg the labour leadership race) then you will invariably end up with two or three parties dominating.  With 650 different seats, statistically it is likely that one or more of the minor parties will win.  The Green party has already managed to break the mould by getting one MP and there are a couple of independents.  MPs are local and fight for local rights, hence there should be a higher likelihood of local people getting elected with AV.

The argument for FPTP is that you may end up with a coalition Government of several parties under AV.  This could be seen as weak as it may mean it is more difficult for Government to get things voted through Parliament (they need more than 50% of the vote).  It may also result in things getting passed through that wouldn't have done normally because only a minority party likes it (eg this vote on AV was something the lib dems wanted, but Labour and Conservatives didn't really - but Lib dems managed to get it through by making it one of the agreements of forming a Government).",0,1302190830,null,0,true,0,c1o9jva,t3_gklh2,t1_c1o9jva,t1_c1o9acw,1427046905,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

How did they come up with this? Surely under FPTP this is more of a risk, as you don't need a majority to gain a seat unlike AV. Unless they're not talking about seats but merely votes for minority parties. In which case, it seems silly to count votes as 'potentially significant electoral power'. Every candidate of any party surely has this risk, or why run at all? I just don't agree with the anti-AV rhetoric that argues minority parties will get more power or be more likely to get into power. Parties, whether large or small, are supposed to be representing the views of people who voted for them.

Imagine your pay gets cut by ¬£5 a year, to save money. You don't say anything, as it's nothing too serious and you can easily cope with ¬£5 a year less. But a month after that, ¬£10 is taken off. You don't say anything because you've already said okay to the ¬£5 deduction and again, it's only ¬£10. That cycle continues until they're taking off hundreds from your pay.

That's the problem. Currently, the government is only cutting services which don't affect us *too* much. People can cope with worse education and no youth centres. But it paves the way for bigger cuts and privatisation in the future, and possibly of services such as the NHS. 

And then when you consider tax evasion, huge banker's bonuses and issues such as the BSkyB takeover, it's simple to see that while we don't have a problem *yet*, we're heading into future problems.

As with ways to fix it....well my main criticism of the entire system isn't that we just need a change in government, but a new system. It would really be nice if there was a government level debate on whether or not capitalism is doing the majority of the population good.

Where I live now, and from I've experienced in other countries I've lived, there is obviously more respect between people (strangers) and family members than in the UK. People are less materialistic, people value their family time more - start work at 7-8 and finish at 16:00 to be home to have a family dinner.

Kids are given space to develop and are not treated as 'kids'.

In the UK, you are judged by what you have. There seems to be an attitude amongst the young that they are owed something from everyone - teachers, strangers etc.

Alcohol abuse is absolutely mad in the UK. Why? Why is it, the youth can get drunk where I live till 3, 4, 5 in the morning and still not cause a fraction of the problems you read about in the UK?

In a way, I'm glad that was has happened to the economy has happened. Hopefully people will start to realise what the fuck they have been doing (just getting in to debt - re-mortgage, credit cards ... ) Hopefully people will take more time and learn more and listen more.

I know from personal experience (close family) about things that have been lost in the last few years (businesses, houses, relationships) People have lost sight of what is real. 

The answer? It's time people got real and stop acting as though the world owes them. Start taking responsibility for their own actions. Start with yourself, get your own house/family in order and the rest will follow.

But what do I know? I'm just like you. At a loss to explain. We all have our own opinions and experiences and they are what we talk about.

They can lost seats and get into government.  
The results after the election don't have to mean a dam.

true,thegenregeek,null,null,"I believe the point of Amy remembering resets the universe. Because if she remembers then the Doctor had to exist at some point. It's a kind of universal reboot command. Because it would create a fundamental paradox for her to remember but for him to not have existed. You also have to consider how wibbly wobbely time is around the Doctor. He's touch so many points in space time that to remove him would destroy the universe. I'd argue he's probably a semi fixed point in time, like Jack, we and he don't realize it. So as the universe collapsed the one final piece of it the Doctor has touch (Amy's life) became the catalyst for him being regenerated into it. Because the universe couldn't have even gotten to that point had he not brought Amy in the first place.

As for crossing his own timeline, I like to think of this quote from Smith and Jones:

[the TARDIS rematerializes in front of Martha Jones, the Doctor exist holding a tie]

The Doctor: Told you.

[the Doctor puts his tie back on as Martha speaks]

Martha Jones: No, but... but that was this morning. Bu - Did you - Oh,
my God, you can travel in time! But hold on: if you could see me this 
morning, why didn't you tell me not to go into work?

The Doctor: Crossing into established events is strictly forbidden. 
Except for cheap tricks. 



Strictly speaking, it's not fundamentally impossible to cross into established events. It's just a horribly bad idea, or else you end up like the 9th Doctor in 'Fathers Day' with the paradox creatures trying to feed off the damage.

There are things I would have done differently but Britain did essentially ragequit Palestine and wouldn't help with the establishment of statehood because they considered the plan unworkable.

That's doubtful, as Palestine's Jewish population, even with 3 decades of Jewish immigraiton, only stood at 9% in 1922. If Britain hadn't promised the Jews a homeland then it would have been easy to close off immigration and to stop the Zionists from getting a hold in Palestine, which ultimately lead to countless problems.

The entire problem is that when Britain got its mandate, it unilaterally promised the Jews a homeland in Palestine despite them forming a small minority, and despite the local inhabitants never being consulted. The Balfour declaration is contradictory as it also stated that nothing would be done to prejudice the rights of the local inhabitants - which simply does not work when you're promising their country to another people.

Basically, had Britain not promised Palestine to the Jews, none of this would have happened.

On another note, I'm glad you've experienced Baker. I am a much younger man who only discovered the new series in reruns on the Sci-Fi channel in America. I've been working my way haphazardly through the old series, and just love Baker's performance. I read someone else's ""first impressions"" review of *Robot*, and while many of their observations were valid, I fell in love with Baker from the scene where he is trying to convince the UNIT medical man that he is fit to leave. I would cherish that episode for the Doctor's jump rope rhyme alone. The Doctor's first instinct was to get moving. Not to run off, but to get back to exploring space and time. It is only when Sarah and the Brigadier convince him their is interest afoot on the earth that the Doctor slows down and decides to help out. The joy for life in Baker's performance is infectious. David Tennant was my first Doctor. What do you think of him, by the way? Going back, he was a hard act for his predecessors to follow, but I think now I would cite Baker as among if not my favorite. 

In the end, most questions about Guinan are explained within Star Trek by her being of the very long lived, wise and peaceable El-Aurian race.

People seem to be too keen in using hindsight to condemn the actions taken when there was not a clear-cut response. What would you do when you have Muslims and Hindus both demanding representation and coming to you about independence? Partition of the primarily Muslim regions and the Hindu regions would have looked to be a very safe option, as it gave autonomy to both individual sets of people and more or less eventually satisfied most people.

With AV, you vote Libdems 1st, Labour 2nd and Tories 3rd. 
This means that when the Libdems lose, your vote will then go to Labour and then Labour wins the election.

Eventually people will see they can vote for who they want as their votes are never spoiled and smaller parties can grow but only if they are supported by a good number of the people.

It means is that people can vote for who they want instead of being scared that if they do, their least favourite party will win.

The main reason the Tories don't want AV is because with two big 'left' parties that split the left votes they have a greater chance of winning.

1. Broadly true. Australia is the main example. That said, proof by popularity is always an iffy notion, especially given the worldwide popularity of dictatorships.

2. Broadly true, although it's incredibly hard to judge a priori.

3. Debatable, depending on how you see 'fairness'. I think removing tactical voting and a system that hinders small parties is a step in the right direction.

4. Probably true. Not exactly a strong endorsement of either position, though.

5. Debatable. Even if the referendum is to help the Lib Dems, many do believe in the principle of FPTP being unfair.

I mean, half of Labour are also in favour, including the Milibands, and it was in the last Labour manifesto.

1. AV will cost ¬£250m. No, it won't. The anti-AV people have plucked that figure out of mid-air. It's unlikely to cost anything extra. Babies and soldiers won't die.

2. AV will help the BNP. The BNP are opposed to AV, because it'll ensure they never get a seat. AV does mean BNP voters will get their votes reallocated, but they're a tiny amount of voters and an inevitable outcome of enfranchisement (i.e. fairness). Scrapping elections entirely or banning the party would also get rid of the BNP.

3. Some people get more than one vote. That's not true: when earlier preferences get eliminated, their voters get reallocated.

true,marinaorange,null,null,"I agree with you for the most part. I like the idea of her character (the swapped timelines), and believe she could be used to create quite an interesting story arc. The problem as I see it is that this idea has not been used effectively. I didn't take offense to her in Silence of the Library or Forest of the Dead, but as panickedthumb said, ""it just doesn't seem like the River from season 5 could become the River from season 4"".

The ""unearned importance"" gets me as well. I cringe every time I hear the ""Spoilers!"" line. It's not as much mysterious as it is an *excuse* to be mysterious. It's supposed to come off as playful teasing, I guess, but it's painfully annoying to me. The ""bad ass"" should be natural, but it feels so forced.

I **know** I don't want River Song to be the Doctor's wife. The Doctor is best played as an asexual character. Not that he can't have his sexual aspects, but the show's focus shouldn't be the Doctor and his sexcapades or romantic ventures.

I really don't know if her character can be salvaged (for me at least) at this point in Smith's run as the Doctor. I'm really hoping her backstory picks up.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Cutting public services does not stifle growth, increasing them does.

Course it does. You are putting people out of work, and increasing the cost faced by people who require those services. Take a small example of a council recycling centre. Say they have their budget cut, have to cut their staff and as a result need to make a surcharge to cope. Everyone who uses that centre now has less free money as a result (to the detriment of the wider economy), the unemployed workers add more strain to benefits and the quality of the service goes down, plus you'll get unintended side affects like an increase in illegal dumping which will cost even more.

&gt; How is private enterprise supposed to compete against a government subsidised entity to whom profit does not matter?

Private enterprise cannot and often should not be allowed to compete with government services. In many cases the services are natural monopolies and in most they are essential. Charging for the  service at the point of use will be very expensive to the general public, and end up removing money from the rest of the economy. Everything the government does at the moment should be geared towards ensuring the general public have as much free cash available as possible, as that is what drives demand. If you cut back in a way that increases the cost of essential services and products, it simply reduces demand and hampers growth. That is still the case even if the private sector try to move into the vacuum left by the government cuts. Those companies may make some extra profits but that doesn't mean the wider economy will benefit.

&gt; Agree on taxing the top 1 per cent. However, it's keeping them in the country once you implement the taxes that's the trick.

He was asked at a panel (about 16-16.5 minutes in on [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96fgOz0uDzs) video) pretty much the very same question you're asking: for a show with 47 years of continuity, is there anything really important I need to know going in?  His response pretty much nailed it for me.


&gt;No, look, there's a blue box. It's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. It can go anywhere in time and space and sometimes even where it's meant to go. And when it turns up, there's a bloke in it called The Doctor and there will be stuff wrong and he will do his best to sort it out and he will probably succeed 'cause he's awesome. Now sit down, shut up, and watch 'Blink'.

This is about right.  Most backstory that's important is explained within the episode -- if he's facing an enemy he's faced before, he'll tell his companion.  That's what they're there for, and why they cycle out every few seasons: they serve as a proxy for the Audience.  So while the Doctor knows almost everything, he still has to explain it to the companion (and, thus, to us.)  There *can* be season-long continuity that may get confusing, but if you start with episode one of a season, the show does a good job of keeping you filled in.

(Gaimann's right, by the way -- ""Blink"" is a fantastic episode.  But it doesn't quite follow the formula of the rest of the series -- neither the Doctor nor his Companion feature very heavily -- so I'm not sure it's the best intro.  I like the two-parter ""Silence in the Library"" and ""Forest of the Dead"" a bit more as an introduction.)",0,1302275938,null,0,true,0,c1of17u,t3_gldr8,t1_c1of17u,t3_gldr8,1427049490,9,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,9

There's a loop in time. The two different timelines exist because of the events in the other timeline; while the two can't exist simultaneously, they cannot exist without the other. Amy is special and has memories from both but she isn't consciously aware of it. The crack exists on her wall in the past because of her involvement with the Doctor in her future. At the end of *The Big Bang* when the Doctor is 'erasing', Amy is aware of the Doctor's presence ('Space Florida' and *The Lodger* scenes). The erasing Doctor then converses with and touches Amy in the *Flesh and Stone* scene and that's when the proper-timeline Doctor begins to figure it out what the crack is. When erasing Doctor pops back to the night Amelia waited, he carries her to bed. When the Doctor is erasing, he's in between the two timelines and able to interact with Amy. Now to my actual point..  
  
Pandora's Box and the Romans are Amelia's favorite things in school because memories from Amy's future are seeping through the crack. It's a delicious paradox, where the past and future are both causes and results. So if this is how the crack functions, it becomes plausible that Rory began life as a plastic centurion. Rory, before his death in *Cold Blood*, is just an artifact left-over from the shrinking Universe in *The Big Bang*. Amy and Rory and later, just Amy, waving in *Cold Blood* isn't evidence that time can be rewritten as much as evidence of a loop in time. So, Rory begins life as an Auton but has memories from before he died in *Cold Blood*; his memories are really just Amy's memories. Rory doesn't have any back story except his relationship with Amy. The Doctor insists that Rory takes Amy's last name because Rory is Amy's imaginary boyfriend, made real.

true,Annix,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Indeed there is - and I certainly agree that it wasn't just the British doing it. In fact, it was this very competition that likely spurred the need to continue to expand and secure interests as widely as possible.

However, it was also this desire to expand - and to control - that led to us becoming involved in these systems to such an extent. Your example of British India is a good one. We were in control of the country when such problems came to a boiling point. We had failed to learn, for example, from the issues of partition that we had already experienced with Palestine when it came to India/Pakistan. Instead, we largely pulled our troops, ministers and diplomats out of the country, and left both sides to declare independence and instigate a mass migration. I agree that hindsight adds clarity to the situation, but many of the issues that arose could have easily been foreseen by looking at previous British withdrawals. We were bankrupt, and needed to leave as quickly as possible - that, and no other, was the reason for the speed of withdrawal.

I do not label colonialism as 'bad' or 'evil', or 'good' for that matter. To apply such binary definitions is to ignore the dynamics that you pointed out. But I think it would also be incorrect to ignore that, ultimately, it was Britain and no other colonial power that found itself in such a position as to influence almost a quarter of the global population. We were at the helm when the 'ship' sank - and we were the ones who had an opportunity to influence the outcome. 

The question posed by the OP was not about the strengths of the US or UK economically today - only whether Britain is to blame for many of the world's problems. I still maintain that our past actions are those that to a large degree led to the circumstances we find ourselves in today, right or wrong. To consider whether, had another country been in that position, there would have been the same outcome would be an exercise in counterfactual thought. Of course others were involved, but none were as successful.

true,MissCrystal,null,null,"This gets addressed so often in /r/doctorwho so often, we've put it on the FAQ.  There are three schools of thought on the matter, but to my mind only two of them are rational.  

School one (the camp I fall into): Start with the first Eccleston episode and watch through the whole reboot.  There is some cheese (some of it even mildly painful if you aren't good at dealing with campy episodes) and absurdity, and the effects haven't necessarily aged well in the past 6 years, but the overall show quality is good.  Potential issues:  This particular season was trying to find its feet.  There are several lower-quality episodes, but that happens with any show.

School two: Start with the first Matt Smith episode and watch series 5, then go back and watch the rest.  Series 5 is very good and explains most of what you need to know.  The effects are better and the production values are pretty amazing.  There are also a few lower-quality episodes, but the quality overall is quite good.  Potential issues: when you finish this and go back to watch the rest of the reboot, you will be suffering from the overall lower-quality effects.

School three (aka the crazy school): Start at the VERY beginning with Hartnell and watch at least a few episodes from each Doctor as you work your way forward.  Potential issues: Pacing.  OMG the pacing.  There is a huge attention span difference between BBC fans in 1963 and BBC fans now.  They expected less from their shows that we do now.  The audience, and therefore the show, has gotten more sophisticated by quite a bit in the intervening 40-odd years.

As for backstory: you probably already know everything you need to.  The Doctor is a time-and-space-traveling madman with a small blue box for a spaceship.

Officially she is the head of state.  Like your president (are you from the US?).  Other than that, she meets with heads of state to eat dinner with them, as well as opening parliament and reading a little speech on Christmas day.  The biggest argument for keeping her at present is that she's a source of tourism.

Personally I believe her and her extended family, whom the UK taxpayers pay to keep in the manner they have become accustomed, are a bunch of uber free loaders.  It's vogue here just now to complain about benefit cheats and people that live off the state, and yet nobody every questions her - the ultimate freeloader.

She should be in a modest house, living off her own income and that's it.

She (honestly) believes that God made her queen, and that her family (she's German by the way), have a divine right to rule over the British people as subjects of hers.

She, and her family, are a 10th century relic, however if I were to use the traditional 10th centure means of deposing her, that so many of her ancestors were keen on (head removed via uprising), I'd be put in prison.

1. Midlesborough is an industrial small city down on it's luck. the crime rate is high for the UK but most likely different to what you might expect a high crime rate to entail (no drive by shootings/meth labs/ far fewer armed holdups - most likely shoplifting, car theft, some muggings, low end drugs problems).

2. Tipping is relatively rare over here, the concept is that if you work the wages cover you. In restaurants people tend to tip but likely at a lower rate than you do in the states. Possibly women's hairdressers are tippable.
Your husband should know the score about tips, casual tipping tends to be of the keep the change model. Middlesbrough might not have lots of posh restaurants for you to tip in anyway

3. Geordies are what we call people from the Newcastle area but in reality people form elsewhere in England tend to lump all of the North East in with them including people from 'boro it can upset them.

4. In England there's plenty of banter. There's a fair chance you will be a target of this. Some people might throw stereotypical views at you which may annoy you. You might want to consider how you deal with that, if you get riled up then that won't help matters, if you fly of the handle that will probably escalate matters.

No.

""The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh are the only members of the Royal Family to receive an annual parliamentary allowance.""

""In 1760, George III reached an agreement with the Government over the Crown Estate. The Crown Lands would be managed on behalf of the Government and the surplus revenue would go to the Treasury. In return, the King would receive a fixed annual payment, which we call today the Civil List.

In 2006-2007 the revenue surplus received by the Treasury from the Crown Estates was ¬£200 million. Since 2001, The Queen receives a set amount of ¬£7.9 million per annum.

About 70 per cent of the Civil List expenditure goes on staff salaries. It also goes towards meeting the costs of official functions such as garden parties, receptions and official entertainment during State Visits. The Queen entertains almost 50,000 people each year.""

I also expect him to pick some edgy political positions to further justify his ego. The positions may well be worthy but it gives him an unwarranted chip on the shoulder that fuels his anger and justifies his comedic attacks not on life but on individuals.

In fact [it's been 7.9 million quid for a generation](http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/Royalfinances/Sourcesoffunding/TheCivilList.aspx), and she's getting [a mite agitated about it](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/7783100/Buckingham-Palace-in-talks-with-Coalition-to-increase-Civil-List.html).  Also, people sometimes think she owns the entire Crown Estate, but in reality [she doesn't](http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/about_us.htm).  It even provides a nice bit of income for the government.  

There are plenty other direct and indirect sources of moolah though, both for old Queenie and her entire nest of welfare scroungers.  Firstly she has her own private property and pretty baubles, which [Forbes (under)estimates at $260 million](http://www.forbes.com/2001/06/26/0626queens.html) and public investments which supposedly make her worth about $420 million total.  However, that's really just the tip of the iceberg as it completely ignores [her private sneaky Bank of England Nominee Account investments](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/may/30/jubilee.monarchy2) which enable her (or at least her advisers) to play the inside trading game.

And this is just Queenie, we haven't yet touched on her family stump and assorted hangers on.  Just for starters, The Duke of Westminster, for example, [has a six billion odd quid estate](http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article610805.ece) smeared across many of the tastier parts of London.

Edit: On a topic related to that second-to-last link; everyone should really be freaking out about that far more than the fact we have an outmoded but mostly de-balled head of state.  World leaders having access to completely private trading accounts should disturb all but the most entrenched interests, whether they are notionally required to declare them or not (and let's face it, in most of the world they're not!)

* Make sure to do the stadium tour and museum while you're there (you'll have to go during a non-game day). [You'll get to check out the trophy cabinet](http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v214/215/25/10120206/n10120206_37941789_9361.jpg?dl=1), learn some stuff about the club you won't get from the wikipedia entry, get to see the dressing room, the ""This is Anfield"" sign etc.
* You can take the bus from downtown to the game. Getting on the bus after the game is a little hard but the trick I figured out was walking ahead to a bus stop before the stadium and boarding before the crowd (take the bus and do the stadium tour the day before so you'll get familiar with the bus route).
* You can buy tickets from lots of online resellers. Cheaper for games against lesser opponents. We got ours delivered to the hotel we were staying at.
* If it's your first time I would find seats in the Main Stand towards the KOP end. You'll get a great angle on the game, the stadium will seem much more substantial (because you get to look at the two-tiered Centenary Stand) and you'll have the best view of the KOP. 
* I would wait at least until your second trip before you sit with the KOP. Participating with the KOP doesn't allow you to truly observe how impressive it is. The KOP is like visiting the Grand Canyon, you have to [stand on the edge of it and take it in](http://www.grandcanyone.com/images/Grand_Canyon_picture.jpg) before you can really enjoy the [experience of being inside of it](http://www.westernriver.com/trips/grand6day/images/2007/wre-grandcanyon-hike.jpg). 
* Use the bathroom and get food before the game and at the half. Do not get up during the game. You'll look like an ass and you may miss something. 
* Bring a scarf, even if it's warm.
* After the game go under the KOP and you can make some new friends by [helping fold up the large banners](http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-ash1/v239/215/25/10120206/n10120206_38490286_258.jpg).

* Assuming you have access to the ballot box, the easiest, quickest and safest way to rig the election is to carry some fake votes and place them in the box. This works for all voting systems and doesn't even require breaking the lock on the box.

* The box and counting should be monitored at all times by two or more election officials. Fixing the ballot at the ballot box won't be easy.

I understand that, but it seems to me that people in a position of authority have an ethical obligation not to simply accept the law as right. I understand why they do it, but I don't think that absolves them of their responsibility for doing it. The law isn't always right, and when you examine the scientific evidence re: cannabis its legal status is a pretty egregious example of that.

&gt;If you're stupid enough to do it out in the open in a place where the rozzers might be, then quite frankly you deserve to have it confiscated.

This seems akin to victim blaming. As precautionary measure I would never use recreational drugs anywhere but the privacy of my home, but if you're peacefully enjoying a substance without bothering anyone then stupid or not you don't deserve to be victimised by the police over it any more than someone who stupidly walks into a bad neighbourhood wearing a rolex would deserve to get it stolen. Smoking in public is a generally a poor decision and not one I would support, but that doesn't mean people *should* suffer as a result, it only means they're likely to.

&gt;And it doesn't matter what substance people choose to abuse, having wasted people stagger around your neighbourhood is unpleasant.

That seems like the appropriate problem for disorderly conduct laws, not general anti-drug laws. Just as you can have one drink without becoming falling-down-drunk, you can have one joint without falling into a semi-comatose but ambulatory state punctuated by uncontrolled fits of giggles. If someone is being a nuisance in public, deal with that, but don't assume that everyone who uses a drug is going to be.

Some others have already mentioned this, but their attitude made me think not to take any notice of them, however you seem somewhat balanced, so I'm interested in your opinion. Here's how I see it, if it helps you gain any insight into how I establish the way I think:

People assign properties (in the label sense, not the house sense) to other people all the time and act on them. The nasty side of prejudice is when you act on these assigned properties when the properties are something that meet the following criteria:

- They are born with it and cannot change it
- They cannot realistically be associated with a pattern, particularly when various other stronger, much less prejudiced patterns are available

Yes, I'm talking about ethnicity. Judging somebody on their ethnicity is horribly prejudiced, you won't get any argument from me, ever. Same goes for sexuality and all the usual stuff people usually and rightfully get upset over.

However, a hoodie is an article of clothing, a choice, with a practical purpose which can be useful for criminals. If somebody wears a hoodie with the hood up, expect to be suspected of potentially being up to 'something', in that, you'll be watched whilst you're around police, but that'll be about it.

A stop and search can only be conducted when given reasonable suspicion, wearing a hoody and having the hood up is not enough to give cause for search. People do not get searched because they have hoodies. People just become extremely wary of them.

I, like everybody else, wish for a world where I didn't need to be cautious of anybody, but it's an unpleasant truth that has to be faced.

&gt;so¬∑cial¬∑ism‚ÄÇ ‚ÄÇ
[soh-shuh-liz-uhm]  Show IPA
‚Äìnoun

&gt;1.
a theory or system of social organization  that advocates the vesting of the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution, of capital, land, etc., in the community as a whole.

&gt;2.
procedure or practice in accordance with this theory.

&gt;3.
(in Marxist theory) the stage following capitalism in the transition of a society to communism, characterized by the imperfect implementation of collectivist principles.

&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/socialism

--

&gt;Your philosophy (""national"" socialism?) is as bankrupt and oxymoronic as ""anarcho""-capitalism.

Value judgements don't make National Socialism any less valid a form as any other.

&gt;Yes New Labour (a corporatist rather than socialist party) had a role in increased immigration.

New Labour was centrist rather than corporatist, and to say it had a role in increased immigration is a bit like saying small rodents had a role in the bubonic plague.

I agree. Which is why the accusations of bias around here are so stupid. I read this article earlier. It is a very well written piece of political polemic. Much of it might even be true.

I can't speak for the accuracy of the figures quoted in the article, but it used to be that people here would make an effort and find out.

You might even go as far as to bend or break the law to accomplish your own agenda, coming across like a complete and utter dick in the process.

I'm not defending this behaviour at all but I can understand it, we're all human beings. You'd probably break under the stress of the job and having to work with a fundamentally broken system to boot. I know I probably would.

If you meet a particular police officer you don't like for some reason, that's fine, It's probably because he or she is being a dick and is not giving you the respect that anyone deserves, or a more serious reason which only gives you more justification to hate them and/or 'the system'.

But that's ok, the law can be used against them too. Don't like a particular officer? Call him or her a cunt and get over it, you have one warning. There's a reason they're being a dick, either a bad day or because of a deeper problem come about from years of abuse on the job. There's no good reason to give them a harder time than they already have.

Anyone who breaks the law, police officer or not should be held accountable and punished accordingly.

Frankly, there are likely to be a few minor, no big deal instances of feeling slightly cut adrift culturally for the first year or maybe two, and a few minor things you look back on later with slight embarrassment as having been naive in your understanding of British mannerisms or language, but it will be okay.

Most of the things that people will tell you are merely a sort of high-functioning stereotyping in the broadest terms, because it's hard to be specific about people.  So don't panic yourself into making a hard and fast rule about what British people are like or what they do.  Be yourself (only a bastard would think less of you for this) while maybe taking just an extra second or two to make sure you fully understand what's going on all the time.

My first point of landing in the UK from the US was Hull, not too far away from Middlesbrough, and I have to say it took a few months before I could function well in shops, hair salons, city council offices, pubs, pizza takeaways, etc.  Just because of the language primarily, but also slightly due to different expectations and attitudes of people than I was used to.

The thing is, the things which you'll be surprised by, will by definition be the things you never gave any thought to because you'd taken them for granted.  You just have to get through that.  In my experience, I remember feeling frustrated at trying to use a public telephone, re-fueling the car, the cash machine giving me my card back before dispensing money, knowing what to say to the person cutting my hair, etc.  Just stuff you don't generally think of.

Having said all that, when you get your hair cut, refer to your 'bangs' as your 'fringe'.

Good luck, and you're more than welcome to PM me if you want the thoughts of anyone who has been through the whole US to UK thing before in your circumstances.",0,1302378020,null,0,false,0,c1olbil,t3_glqm4,t1_c1olbil,t3_glqm4,1427052515,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Private provision of healthcare is not an instant failure, and we can look at various EU models as examples, the Dutch, French and German models are interesting and we should be comparing the pro's and con's of those systems to the NHS. There is also the Danish system to look at, if we want a purely public system. One key thing about all those systems is that they are far more decentralized than ours.

Had Away! - Come on!

Had away an shite! - No way!

Canny - Nice, pretty.

Divn't - Don't.

A society that allows free speech over tolerance of ethnic and religious groups, on the other hand, slowly breeds misery, discrimination and potentially violence for huge numbers of people. Its not just ""causing offense"".

BTW the only reason we hold free speech as a value above other values is because that has been drilled into us by the wealthy libertarians who control the media, whose interests that arrangement suits best. We have the implicit assumption that free speech is THE most important thing for a free human. Just ask yourself, where did this idea come from? We can't have everyone be completely free all the time, we MUST make restrictions, the only problem is which.

It's not turning up anywhere that I've looked either, so I can only assume that if it was on Youtube, Dailymotion or Liveleak, that it has been taken down. Can't even find it on Stormfront- which is kind of odd to say the least.

The actual content would be paramount. If the film was obviously made deliberately for distribution to extremists and it's obvious that he's knowingly being filmed- for example addressing the audience via the camera- and deliberately inciting violence then that would indeed be his responsibility. Also the context of when the film was made and whether it relates at all to the Dove Outreach incident which sparked violent demonstrations in Afghanistan. Is it possible that this is a new video deliberately planned as some sort of follow-up to that?

The police would appear to have arrested the cameraman as well- who obviously, regardless of content, would have known that the film was being made and would be distributed.

I think there's probably a lot more to this story than is covered in the article. It will be interesting to see what charges, if any, result from this.

edit: I've since had a look round a number of newspaper sites and it would appear that only the Guardian is covering this at the moment. I couldn't find any mention of this story at the Mail, Express, Telegraph, Mirror or Star. I assume that's because it's the weekend and their respective news-desks only have the most basic skeleton staff manning them, however I expect this one to break out across those sites fairly rapidly.

However, the majority of people do seem to respect the sanctity of it even if they're not Muslim, so it's not likely that this guy will get much public support (even Nick Griffin has been slow to say anything so far and he's a giant racist).

I don't think that we can allow fundamentalists scare us into not burning a book, nor can we ban person expression. I really liked Infinite Jest, loved it in fact, and if someone burned it, I'd be upset, but I'm not going to demand that the police arrest someone for upsetting me. What if it had been Dianetics, or another Scientology text? We all scoff at them, but some people take them to heart. Do we only get upset if there's a bunch of belligerent fundies behind this particular book?

Yes I understand that people hold their faith very dear, but you're not allowed to impose that on me, and if part of your faith is praising the sanctity of whatever be it the shroud of Turin, the Koran, Battlefield Earth, the Red Book (Jung or Mao), you can't make me respect that, and you can't ban me from doing what I want with it. 

He may be a racist shit, but he's not actually hurt anyone. They only people that have hurt anyone over the Koran burnings so far have all been Muslims. In Afghanistan. And the only people threatening to hurt anyone are aggrieved Muslims.

Doctor Who is a show all about inclusiveness and hope for humanity. the fact that shows two elderly couples in a positive and normal way is to be applauded not dismissed.

The writers of Doctor Who do not have to promote any idea or concept or aspect of humanity each week. They only have to write about the fictional adventures of a Time and space traveling alien who takes a couple of humans along for the dangerous and funny ride. That is it. That is all required to do. Along the way they can tell address real world problems with a fantastical alien creature. I think you have better targets for bigotry and non inclusiveness than Doctor Who.

But that doesn't make it perfect from every possible angle. It would be easy for someone to write a whole dissertation on thoughtlessly racist treatment of Martha, for example. (God, her mother and sister in maid's uniforms?! Hello?!) There was a bit of class stereotyping of Rose and Jackie, too that could be a bit over the top, and sometimes the gay characters could be a bit token, as you pointed out. 

I actually think Jack being described as a ""Fifty-first century kind of guy"" was one of the better handlings of non-hetero sexuality, and that was Moffat. Kind of an offhand way of indicating that in the distant future, it just doesn't matter so much who you like to sleep with. Which is cool. I feel like RTD often made too big a deal of it in the context of the universe they're imagining. 

It seems to me that's what Moffat's been trying to do with gender and race as well in the episodes he's written, to imagine a world where none of it really matters so much. It's a nice fantasy, and I enjoy pretending to be in that world, too. But you have to be careful of how that reads to an audience living in a time and place where it still kind of does matter in a lot of contexts, and be careful that you're not accidentally pulling them out of the story with it.

Sure the Doctor kind of saves the day in the end, but he couldn't of done it without Sally.

Your issue with Amy I think is unfounded, she doesn't stick herself into situations without having a plan because she is a woman, she does that because she's young and inexperienced.

As to the whole issue of less LGBT friendliness, Moffat created the idea of humans in the 51st century being a gay pride parade wet dream, everyone having sex with everyone regardless of gender/race/species and what time period is River Song from? The 51st century (according to the commentary in silence of the library), so she is a very prominent LGBT character.

&gt;How is using something that has been done forever a bad thing?

It's only a problem if every female character is a trope.  A varied, diverse cast of ladies (and gentlemen) is important and the need for more strong, varied, diverse women in roles should never be underestimated, especially after generations of white men being the most well-drawn characters.

&gt;A varied, diverse cast of ladies (and gentlemen) is important 

I agree, and I do see a varied cast in season 5 and the other Moffat episodes. Amy is her own person a spunky Scottish redhead with a loud mouth who sometimes plays the damsel in distress. River is a bad ass, who we know very little about, but fits the strong female. Rory is not at all the normal man, being a scrawny nerdy guy, that I think a lot of Who lovers can relate to.

My biggest problem with your characterization is that you're asking the show to be something it's not. This is a kid/family show. You won't see much in the way of LGBT treatment in it for that reason. Not until cultures change enough to make that sort of thing acceptable at any rate.


For a comparison take a look at the sexuality of Torchwood compared to Doctor Who. I don't think it's because Davies is more gay friendly than Moffat but because the show itself is intended for adults and thus can take more freedoms.

With regards to Moffat being more hetero-normative than RTD, I just think first, something like sexuality shouldn't be a primary focus in what is essentially a goofy children's sci-fi show. I can't read minds, but maybe Moffat is keeping this in mind while he helms the show.

That said, I do agree that RTD was far more LGBT friendly than Moffat. But I kind of want to give Moffat the benefit of the doubt when it comes to more LGBT friendly writing, cause a scene from Sherlock sticks out in my mind where Sherlock and Watson discuss sexuality to an extent while they're sitting in the diner. Watson thinks Sherlock may be gay, Sherlock denies it and suggests he's asexual. Both agree that despite that, there's nothing wrong with being gay.

Just because he didn't go out with grace doesn't mean he wasn't well developed. I think it showed the weakness in his character, which I liked. The Doctor shouldn't be perfect.

And I don't think his particular defining theme was that he was lonely. I think he was defined by his tragedy. The entirety of his tenure as The Doctor was spent trying to hold onto the threads of companionship. He lost Donna to the whole meta-crisis thing, he lost Martha to unrequited love, and he lost Rose to a genocidal version of himself, which had to sting. That was his arc. His was a story of a man grasping at the compassionate side of life only to have it slip through his fingers time and time again.

And then, he died alone, submerged in fear and regret. His death was not meant to be redeeming, it was meant to be sorrowful and maybe a bit pathetic. A man who had faced unassessably fearful odds time and time again, unable to face the imminence of his own demise.

Have you ever watched [Keeping Up Appearances](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uquSW3NEuio)? It magnifies the divisions. Hyacinth Bucket is lower-middle class. You can tell because she's trying so hard to be middle/upper class. This is why she's embarrassed of her working-class family. She doesn't want to be confused with them.

Meanwhile her neighbors are firmly middle-class. That's part of why they make fun of her. It's also why they get along well with Hyacinth's family. They're not worried about being confused with the working-class.

Some generalizations:

Bling, is the working class way to show status. In other words, someone with a gold jag, branded designer clothes, who goes golfing - probably working-class who made some money. A US example would be rims on a shitty car.

The middle-classes prize sophistication and culture. This manifests itself in food choices (because you know about other cuisine), and media consumption.

The upper-classes don't work. Earning money by working instead of from property was/is traditionally a bit taboo. Hence, you'll have impoverished landowners in a run-down country estate who's only income is from the land they own and who don't work. Of course, most have a job nowadays, but you don't talk about it or you pretend it's just a hobby. In academics studying something entirely unrelated to professional life, eg: history of phoenician cuisine, is therefore upper-class. Working in finance for example, isn't generally seen as work - as you're not actually producing anything. Just running things.

**tldr** the lowest classes live off the state. the upper-classes live off their estate.

River Song is cunning, resourceful, tough, intelligent character and clearly on equal footing as the Doctor.

I think we can safely say that as a writer, Moffet can and does write strong women, but that is not how I want every character, male or female written. I want them to be human beings, with faults and contradictions and non-perfectness. A person like River Song is a rare character with an abundance of strengths. Amy is more realistic, she is not that different from many woman her age. A bit boy-crazy, brash, and silly even. What is she 20 or so in the show? 

You said that the other female companions grew and changed, but Amy as had only a single season to develop, and she is also the youngest of the new series. It is hardly a fair comparison.

I guess my point is that it seems you identified Amy as a damsel in distress because she isn't a 100% tough, strong, independent woman.

Series 5 definitely improves, and manages to be the most imaginative of the lot. ""The Beast Below"" benefits from a re-watch, by the way.

Whereas RTD would make Rose and the Doctor run towards each other across a burning street (Lionel Richie's ""Hello"" perhaps playing in your head, or an 80s love song video), Moffat makes a slow, quiet reveal about Amy's parents as the Doctor sits in the Pandorica, creeping it up on you and breaking your heart.

Is it not just possible that the principles of the EDL are born not of an irrational or illogical hatred of others, but of a desire to prevent the kind of conflict, discord and disharmony that is so frequently associated with attempts to establish multicultural/multi-ethnic societies in other parts of the world?

First off, it is tough to keep a magazine running in the internet age.  It has to offer things that you can't get on the Web.  DW Magazine does this.  Insider does not.  The cover bills never before seen production art.. But it was all available on the BBC site months ago. 

Second, there is already a great magazine (DWM) on the racks, so DWI would need to offer something more or different.   They bill it as a companion the DWM.  It's not.  It had less pages, lighter content, larger font..  I felt that I was reading a magazine for pre-teens.   

Third - Prices.  6.99 for a weaker, watered down US version of DWM?   Thanks but no thanks.  

I don't need DW to be Americanized.  I don't want us to have our own magazine.  I certainly don't want them to Americanize the show.  The British versions of the show and the magazine are fantastic as is.   Leave it alone and let us enjoy the great work they put out and stop trying to stripmine the property for every extra dollar you think you can squeeze out  of it.

For me; if a Yes occurs then it's tactically a good thing for Cameron because he keeps the support of the Liberals and it's really them who he has to please. It's fairly common for cabinets to have the big names from groups you don't trust because then they are under your control (if you don't believe me then have a read of some UK Politics textbooks). It makes the Liberals look stronger as they got what they wanted and the Tories get to stay in government and roll out their main policies. I think there might be resentment towards the Lib Dems, but not from the people who really wield the power (Ken Clarke or someone else of such magnitude).

If there is a No vote then I see the Lib Dems getting twitchy as they will be wondering what they got in coalition for. I think those in the cabinet see more of what influence the Lib Dems have had, and so those in the back will feel a little more annoyed. But the Lib Dem line seems to be that they've managed to get certain things in agreements, so I suspect losing the referendum won't be the straw that breaks the camel's back.

So I think tactically the Lib Dems will lose out no matter what happens and the only thing they can do is bide their time until the next election and hope to inspire. A poor result in Wales and Scotland is probably a worry for them and seeing seats they've held for decades going to the SNP would probably be more disastrous.

So really, Lib Dems will lose out whatever happens. One way they look weak and lose a key part, and lose power in Scotland and Wales, the other way they get what they want but even with a yes I think there will be a little bit of separation.

Hope someone enjoyed my musings there... It's certainly interesting.",0,1302475408,null,0,false,0,c1oqzci,t3_gmpmm,t1_c1oqzci,t3_gmpmm,1427055252,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

&gt;In the Doctor Who Confidential episode, You've Got the Look (released to accompany ""The Impossible Planet""), Russell T Davies said that he wanted the Ood to resemble the Sensorites, and that he likes to think they come from a planet near the Sense Sphere. This was later confirmed in the Tenth Doctor episode ""Planet of the Ood"", in which the Doctor visits the Ood's homeworld (the Ood-Sphere) and mentions that he once visited the Sense-Sphere in the same system.

hahahahaha right.  go from a team that hasnt finished worse than 3rd in 7 seasons, with nearly guaranteed european competition, to an annually mid table team just because ""theres too much competition for playing time.""  
when you're the best, there's no such thing as too much competition, and i think sturridge will likely grow to become the best striker in the world (and from what I hear, so does he). honestly the way he's been playing for bolton, he doesn't look that far off.

oh and like chelsea would sell the best young english forward out there when we have two over 30 year old strikers on the end of their careers. 

not surprising to see that these are mostly man u and liverpool fans with these stupid comments, mostly saying this cause they never want to face us with a fully developed sturridge in a blue shirt.

It's not Cameron as much as the backbenchers; many have made it known to Cameron that he will face parliamentary chaos if AV wins. Rebellions would dramatically increase, rumours of leadership bids would circulate, and the coalition would be in a dark, dark place indeed.

You're quite correct that governments want to represent as many aspects of their party/ies as possible to keep the backbenchers feeling involved in decision making (seeing ""one of their own"" in office helps, I mean we have both Liam Fox and Vince Cable in the same cabinet!), but the thing is that it seems like many Liberal Democrats have already become resigned to Lords reform being the flagship Liberal policy that holds the coalition together rather than AV. Why do you think the Lords reform bill is being held off until after May's vote when it was promised last summer, then last December, then early in the new year? The Tories will only let the Liberal Democrats have a decent shot at the Lords if they have to, and that's if the Liberal Democrats lose on AV.

Though what with the recession and now the cuts things are a bit glum.

Billingham was rebuilt after being leveled in the second world war very much in the brutalist style though so I do feel for you getting stuck there. If you can, try to live a little bit out of town so you don't have to look at it all the time.

Though you will need a car to get about, the roads are pritty good if a bit busy with Lorries rarely a Jam anywhere even in rush hour. Public transport however consists of Busses which either don't go anywhere you want (i.e. home) or take forever to get there and insist on going though all the dodgy areas first or trains which are just slow. But you never know you might get lucky with them.

On that note if you're worried about crime much of it is petty theft by duggies so keep your shed locked and you won't have a problem. There's rarely anything serious happen at least not anything avoidable i.e. the pubs at kicking out time.

However if you want some green you don't have to go far with the Penines to the west and the North York Moors to the south.

Middlesbrough is the main town with the most shops and nightlife, the shopping centers for the chains and closer to the university on Linthorpe road for the boutiques and Psyche. Stockton is a little smaller but has a seemingly permanent market and Darlington can make for a bit of a change of scenery. Also York and Newcastle are only about an hour away by train or car in opposite directions and Leeds isn't much further. For out of town shopping, don't bother with Teesside park take the bit of a drive up to Dalton park, its better trust me.

The best beach is probably Saltburn with its surfing community, unless you feel like trecking down to Whitby, though stop off at Redcar for a lemon top.

Also make sure you get the Evening Gazette, for a local paper it is pretty good and really good for a Daily. It seems things actually happen around here. Its available online http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/

I can see the scene going something like this. River is holding a blaster or something on the Doctor.

""River, I know your scared, and I can't tell you why, but if you shoot me you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life..."" The Doctor pauses for a moment, realizing that part of what he says sounds oddly familiar, but he ignores it for the time being, readopting a serious expression. ""River, things can change, time can change! I'm telling you, I knew this was going to happen, but IT DOESN'T HAVE TO!"" 

River shoots, and the odd stranger she just met falls on the ground. She assumes he is dead and runs off before she is caught.

Sometime later, the Doctor awakes, feeling much worse for wear, but having survived. 
""Oh...  wonderful, I'm alive."" He runs his hands over his brow and down over his nose. ""Same old face, wonderful..."" He pauses for a moment and his smile falls, ""not wonderful, oh River I'm sorry."" 

Their next chronological meeting (river's timeline) would have her meeting the Doctor, perhaps shocked that he is still alive, and getting to know him better, assuming whatever circumstance she shot him for is over.

The main problem I see with this is that she has apparently traveled with numerous incarnations after Smith. She mentioned having to use her own sort of spotter's guide to tell, and she would have not met 10 by this point.

The Council received an application to close Earlham Street from Republic, an organisation who wished to hold a ‚ÄúNot the Royal Wedding Street Party‚Äù on 29 April 2011.‚ÄúWhile we know Republic to be a responsible organisation we are unaware of any local connection with between them and the location they have chosen. We also understand that a neighbouring Council have refused a similar request from Republic.

‚ÄúWhile the event was widely publicised by Republic prior to permission being granted we consider all street closures on merit.

‚ÄúAn initial application was due to be refused following concern from the police as to how the event would be managed, and strong local objections, and the council entered into constructive dialogue with Republic. We requested that they provide us with an event management plan and engage with local residents and businesses to build support for such an event taking place in their community.

‚ÄúDuring discussions with the community, significant concerns were raised around the potential for disorder and the impact of the event taking place. Many local businesses were opposed to the event taking place as it would directly contradict the Royal Wedding theme in terms of their merchandise.

‚ÄúTaking into consideration the feeling of the local community the council have decided to refuse the application and Earlham Street will not be closed on 29 April 2011.‚Äù

Previously there were no objections from business, locals and police. The event was [initially approved](http://mycamden.camden.gov.uk/LicensingRegister/LicensingDetails.aspx?page=2&amp;type=3&amp;Input=APP\TEN\006246&amp;xsl=nlPlrDetail.xsl). Republic were talking more of [residents in that general area](http://www.westendextra.com/news/2011/mar/royal-disapproval-12000-strong-republic-party-group-plan-anti-wedding-street-party-apr), the street in question is a fairly non-descript non-residential small side street if you look at [streetview](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=earlham+street+covent+garden&amp;cp=28&amp;pq=earlham+street+covent+garden&amp;safe=off&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl). This is also a Labour council here making the decision I would note, so I'm not pulling the political card in that sense. Does seem ironic in the light of our dear PM's statement on red tape. The business objection appears to be from [Shaftesbury PLC.](http://www.shaftesbury.co.uk/), property developers who are yet to explain their objection. What is more concerning is the general feeling from the council this political act will bring trouble (even though they recognise Republic as a trusted organisation), but that doesn't seem to be the case here, that it's OK to party if you if you agree, and a concern it will dampen the sale of tat, unlikely to be sold in any of the immediate business outlets. Business here could actually benefit from the influx of potential custom.

There are other benefits of having the Monarch as head of state, mainly that she is impartial and cannot be influenced by political or corporate concerns, unlike say, in the US where election campaigns are coloured mainly by corporate donations. She is a focus for national awards and prestige worldwide, i.e. it looks good if you've had something awarded to you by the Queen. She is also head of state with 16 other countries, uniting the Commonwealth and boosting trade across it.

Finally and most importantly it could be argued she is a safeguard against political extremism. I said before that the Queen predominantly does not use her powers, that isn't to say she does not have any.

I also think that their entire relationship is a bit of a paradox where the doctor knows River is an important person to him at some point in his future so knowing that when they eventually do cross paths  early in her timeline before she knows him he already knows she's important.

The reason gay men can't give blood is because it is massively more likely to contain HIV, to the point where taking blood from gay men is isn't even worth the effort, i.e. their bed would be better taken up with someone who hadn't been bumming.

If you're interested in the stats, normal sex is at about 1:1000-100,000, if the man has it and the woman doesn't (if its the other way around its too low to calculate) where as bum sex is more like 1:50.

However, they rarely extended this in what first hand material I have read to any sort of racial bias. Rome had, in the public perception, the capacity to civilize any brought up in her culture. By the time of the empire, it would have been very likely to see more than a few dark faces in the ranks of your average legion. By the end, the armies were mostly foreigners either from the Gothic lands to the north or from Africa. Rome had a sort of interesting take on slavery. Most slaves were freed on the death of their master and their children were, during most of imperial history, granted citizenship either through birth to a freed family or by dint of military service. Within three generations one's family could ascend to great acceptance and prominence within Roman culture, even being able to run for high offices and the like.

imagine chelsea walking out with a 4-3-3 like this next season: 

neymar torres sturridge
lampard (or a new left sided mid) mceachran ramires
cole terry luiz ivanovic (or a new RB)
cech

sturridge is strong with his left so cutting in from the right, he would be absolutely deadly (basically playing messi's position at barca)
neymar would be absolutely perfect for the left of a 4-3-3, since he's strong with his right foot. basically all we would be missing from a near perfect team is a more pass minded left mid, as lampard is looking past it and we would have such a clinical strike force, service would be way more productive than goals from the midfield.
essien can come in for mceachran for the more physical premier league games, but we need mceachran's passing more than essien's drive with strikers that like balls played into space instead of at their feet (like drogba).  
the pace we would have up front would be absolutely deadly, and the team would be dominant in europe

His assist tally for a winger is only average but the article doesn't mention the fact that our strikers are all misfiring this season to the point of embarrassment.

We should really be looking at the ""chances created"" stat and I promise you that stat will tell a very different story (if there is such a stat). The article doesn't mention his work-rate. His tracking back to help out Benoit Assou-Ekotto is phenomenal. He probably runs farther during a game than any other footballer in the Premiership or the world for that matter.

****

Forwards:

* Daniel Sturridge (at Bolton Wanderers)   
* Ga√´l Kakuta (at Fulham)  
* Fabio Borini (at Swansea City)  
* Danny Philliskirk (at Sheffield United)  

I hope Sturridge has a spot with the first team next year. Kakuta is unlikely to have one, unless Malouda, Zhirkov, or both leave in the summer. Borini has been alright but nothing spectacular - did have a good free kick goal playing with the U-21s though.

****

Midfielders:  

* Conor Clifford (at Notts County)  
* Jacob Mellis (at Barnsley)  
* Jack Cork (at Burnley)  

Three very good midfielders, although I don't think any will be with the senior side next year. We do have lots of midfield talent, and I don't think any are better than Mikel, who finds appearances hard to come by now.

****

Defenders:

* Patrick van Aanholt (at Leicester City)  
* Michael Mancienne (at Wolverhampton Wanderers)  
* Jeffrey Bruma (at Leicester City)  
* Ben Gordon (at Scunthorpe United)  
* Slobodan Rajkoviƒá (at Vitesse)  

We've already seen Bruma and van Aanholt make appearances for the senior Chelsea squad, but I think it is unlikely for either to have a spot in the squad next season. We're stocked at centre back and Ashley Cole has been in great form, and Zhirkov is a quality backup. If Zhirkov moves on though, I could see van Aanholt being Cole's backup. Mancienne may be moving on this year as it seems unlikely he will be able to even get a spot on the bench. Neither Gordon nor Rajkovic will be with the senior squad, as far as I can tell.

****

Keepers:

* Sam Walker (at Barnet)  
* Matej Delaƒç (at Vitesse)  
* Rhys Taylor (at Crewe Alexandra)  

Given the number of games that Cech has played in this year, and pretty poor form shown by both reserve keepers, it's possible we'll have at least one (maybe two) new keeper on the bench next season. However, unless they look absolutely phenomenal, it's rare for a young keeper to get a chance with a big club so we may will opt for an experienced keeper. Delac is the best of the three I believe, although Taylor has been with the club for a while.",0,1302576648,null,0,false,0,c1oycnu,t3_gnt5o,t1_c1oycnu,t3_gnt5o,1427058862,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

true,Laurasaur,null,null,"I worked in a blood centre until last year. I am biased but I know a bit about how it works too..

I used to issue blood to hospitals primarily but because I was often doing weekend shifts I was also responsible for other things, such as taking in donations and loading them up to go to processing at another centre.

Transport is arguably as important as the processing and testing and issuing of the blood. It is a central service, part of the backbone of NHSBT. These central services really need to work together closely to manage supply. If you put up layers in between them you make the job far, far harder and it's patients who suffer. I have already seen this when processing and testing were moved from my centre to a 'central' place to save money.

There are lots of potential issues with switching transport to another company besides this one. 

The real issue is that the focus will move from 'health' to 'profit'. If it can be done cheaper privately it can be done cheaper publicly. The physical costs of a driver, vehicle and fuel will not change. The reason it costs more is different priorities and training.

Cost cutting means having less drivers to deliver stuff, and less well trained drivers, splitting their time with other work and probably not keeping them at the same site as the blood centre. 

Currently drivers are generally trained so that they can do 'blue light' deliveries - emergency ones - and know about handling blood. When you have an order to go out a driver can be there immediately or you can phone him directly. Oh and he'll know where to go. Couriers always add delays and communication difficulties, they sometimes get lost and currently can not do blue light deliveries. 

Cut back on drivers and there's going to be more difficulty in arranging transport to get those most urgent deliveries out. Ideally hospitals would have a plentiful supply of blood so they never need emergency orders. Unfortunately blood is a limited resource and we simply can't do that. The other issue is that drivers need to know - and care - about keeping blood within specified temperature ranges.

I'm not saying a private company can't do this but I don't think they can magically do it cheaper than the NHS unless they compromise somewhere, which risks patient lives.

It's also worth remembering that where NHSBT makes a profit the money goes back into the NHS at the end of the year. The actual service itself is very different to the supplies it buys and things like that. 

NHSBT has a monopoly, too, so if it became privatised it could start charging more and more, would care less about the NHS and patients and hospitals would be up shit creek without a paddle. Currently there is no motive to charge hospitals except to cover costs and stop them being wasteful/taking more than they need. If management took their head out of their asses for more than two minutes it would be easy to switch suppliers of equipment but this is not so for the service as a whole.

As a donor, the problem I have, is with fat cat shareholders making money from my donation. I don't mind companies and people being paid fairly for their labour and products. I DO mind someone putting money before life.

Edit: and for what it's worth I do not agree with most of the private companies currently creaming off money from the NHS, or things like the upper management who apparently awarded themselves ¬£20k payrises recently.

Let's not forget that more people voted in the 2005 X-Factor (10.8 million) than voted for the Labour party (9.5 million) when they ""won"" the election in the same year.  What's more, the X-Factor voters paid 35p each for the privilege of voting.

Tony Blair personally received (if memory serves) a mere 29,000 votes, but someone got to lead the country into a war that the majority of people were clearly (and vocally) against.  On X-Factor that level of support would get you evicted.

The current political setup is, in my opinion, an institutionalised scam designed to put as much power in the hands of as few people as possible, while maintaining the illusion that we live in a democracy.  Sure, we always have the option of voting out the current party, but what's the alternative?  More of the same.

AV is the system that most entrenches tactical voting, that's a pretty established criticism of it as a system. Here's a thought experiment:

*you are  65 years old. You REALLY hate the Liberal Democrats. How do you make sure that the Lib Dems don't get in in your seat?*

Simple: You see that the Tories are their closest rivals in the seat. You make them number one on your form. Now, you don't really want them, but they aren't as bad as the Lib Dems right? Ok, now second preference. Labour would also give them a run for their money, so you put them second. Again, preferable right? OK, now third choice... urm, getting pretty thin on the ground here. OK, well the party with the fourth most vote last time round was the BNP- well, I don't want them, but if it diminishes the Lib Dem's chances of getting 50%- right, done. And 5th- the greens. Done.

Meanwhile, let's say you *really* want the Lib Dems in. You are exercising a **positive** choice for the MP you want, or perhaps you agree with their manifesto. Now, you can either vote just once, as they are the only MP that you want, and you don't like the other candidates. OR, maybe you think ""OK, I don't actually mind the Tory candidate for this seat- he's a progressive Tory as a rule and could exert a positive influence"". Now, are you really gonna feel positive about *all* the candidates? Probably not. So your vote is diminished in value compared to the negative tactical voters. So you have a choice- pursue your democratic right to make a **positive** choice for your representative, or also try to figure out the best tactical plan for ensuring the least 'harmful' result to your interests. Nobody benefits. Basically, AV is absolutely classic game theory in action. Try having a ganders at the prisoners dilemma while you're at it.

And furthermore, part of the upshot of this system is the vastly increased likelihood of minority parties being able to exert influence in the UK parliament. If it is the Greens, that's great. But it also means that the English Defence League, The BNP etc. also having an increased role in national politics. That is a not inconsiderable consequence, and one that people really need to think about regarding this change.

Basically, the coalition has offered us the one alternative to FPTP which is arguably less democratic, more likely to lead to tactical voting, and in actual fact *less* representative.

TL:DR- AV doesn't stop tactical voting, it encourages it. Also, I have two big hands and a heart pumping blood and a 1967 colt .45 with a busted safety catch. This is important.",0,1302613018,null,0,false,0,c1p081b,t3_go24s,t1_c1p081b,t1_c1p04wv,1427059740,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

At the moment with FPTP I have to vote for their rival. I really wanted the greens to get elected and instead have been forced to vote for the tories. Under AV I vote first for the greens, I want them to win. Then I put labour in as my second choice, then I put the tories as my third choice.

I've just voted for the people I want to win, and against the guys I dont. Simples.

&gt;Lets say I really want the lib dems to win

Under FPTP I vote lib dem. Under AV I vote lib dem as my first choice. I can then simply stop ranking, or, if I want to I can also put labour in as a second choice, I quite like labour, just not as much as the lib dems.

However, the sad fact is that, statistically speaking, black people are more likely to be poor (sorry, ""underprivileged"" is the PC term) than white people.  Poor generally equates to a lower standard of education and less chance of getting into Oxford.

So what we're seeing at Oxford is a symptom of a larger problem in society.

However, if you are black and about to apply to go to University then it's worth giving Oxford a shot.  I suspect they will be falling over themselves to discriminate in favour of black candidates for the next intake.

It's nothing about ""being worthy"", it's about putting motions forward that concern that others may choose to support with the eventual goal of making it law.

The problem with a PR system is that you take away the representation of a limited number of people by one person, and make it a choice between a limited number of political parties. There is no political party that adequately represents my viewpoint, so I vote for the candidate I believe who will best put forward my opinions. The last three elections, those have always been Labour candidates, but I'm not opposed to voting Conservative providing it's not a crazy like Claire Perry or Anne Widdecombe. I'm not overly enamoured with the heavy involvement of the Unions in Labour politics either, but the *candidate* won me round.

Now, that pretty much seals me in for a non-PR system, what about AV? AV should be perfect - ensures that at least 50% of the vote goes to the winner. However, there's one gigantic flaw - the candidate with the fewest votes gets eliminated, then his/her and ONLY his/her second preference votes are considered.

This, I think, is the crux of everything.  One either believes in democracy or they don't, and if you do, why settle for an awful attempt at it when better alternatives exist?  AV is a miserable compromise, but it will better represent the views of the populace in governance than FPTP does, and I can't find a single justification anywhere in my persona that loathes liberalism sufficiently to sway me away from supporting it.

I've yet to hear a good argument in favour of FPTP or opposed to AV.  Everything I've heard thus far appears to boil down to arguments that smaller parties and those who support them should be actively marginalised in our democratic processes, or some vague references to tradition and base appeals to, ""One man, one vote,"" that really don't stand past even a moment's thought.

Then again, the Doctor was the same way from the start of the series, and he evolved as a character.  I think it's just odd and hard to accept that we're viewing her arc in *reverse*, which means we've already seen where she's evolving *to*.  I'd love to see them give her a season with the Doctor as a proper exclusive companion in her earlier years, so that we can see her character grow *into* the version we've already seen.  I want to see her learn to pilot the TARDIS for the first time.",0,1302621487,null,0,false,0,c1p0wft,t3_gnhl3,t1_c1p0wft,t1_c1owsq9,1427060061,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

They will work out at about 60p each, including posting costs. It would be even cheaper if my GP would just prescribe them to me!
