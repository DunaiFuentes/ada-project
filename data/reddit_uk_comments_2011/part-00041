If someone is not a danger to others then there's no point in removing them from society, they can be punished (rehabilitated) in other ways.

The first chap is not a danger to others and has not committed a violent offence, so there's no point in sending him to prison. The second chap raped a toddler and groomed dozens of other girls over the internet, he is a danger to others and should be sent to prison.

It's very simple if you understand the concept of imprisonment as being for the protection of others rather than as punishment.

For those who don't know (you never know there may be non-UK residents subscribed to this reddit) ITV is the NBC of UK Television, but with even less vision and leadership.  The company who cancelled The South Bank Show, one of the longest running arts programmes on British Television ""to save money"", in the same year they commissioned Paddy Mcguinness's Take Me Out—a game show format where chavs slag each other off after going on a free holiday in Shagaluf.  Real highbrow stuff.

As for ITVPlayer, I sent them an email per-week when the last series of Celebrity Juice was running, because during every single episode, without fail, after what should have been the second commercial break, the Adobe Flash player decided it didn't want to play the third part of the programme.  Tried it on Windows, Mac and Linux and every time the same deal.

Since that was the only programme on their entire network I was interested in watching, I can't say if it affected any other shows, but considering they replied to exactly ZERO emails, I can only presume they either didn't care or didn't know how to fix it.

The recently released iPhone app doesn't work at all, either, and as if it wasn't enough that there's never anything on ITV worth watching in the first place.

Martha becomes pragmatic, but not evil; Donna is reset; Rose is Rose; the Ponds see to be too good...)

My problem with RTD is that he tended to insist on making things ""for kids"" in a way that is a turn-off for me as an adult (kids love fart jokes!)... whereas Moffat's idea of things being ""for kids"" is more like Pixar: make it so kids will understand and be happy, while letting the adults have fun as well.

Christianity was a big influence on the creation of Islam, for instance the concepts of hell and devil.

Judaism was created from the pagan beliefs common in the middle-east and even after the formation of Judaism, people living within the Jewish community still made idols and altars to those pagan gods.

Having said that (this is going to be unpopular so get your tar and feathers ready)...

**Devil's Advocate:**

   Whilst against attacking consumer rights the Jobcentre is both expensive and replaceable with virtually immediate effect, little transition phase and little cost.  That, whilst perhaps controversial, was not *the* controversial bit.  Maternity leave, and especially paternity leave, hobbles small to medium sized business.  

Big business and large employers can carry it somewhat but it can kill the smaller fish.  I'm all for the idea of maternity and paternity leave in theory, pragmatically it should just be negotiated or established when signing contracts until it is sustainable.  It will still make sense for organizations such the NHS to provide it, or any other industry that employs trained, skilled professionals.

Equality in the workforce is one thing but whatever laws are put in place you'll never get it.  If there's two equally qualified candidates for one position, with the same experience, same personality, and equal in every respect except one has a womb and the other has testes, then whilst it might not be entirely legal an employer will simply find an abstract, unverifiable reason to employ testes.  It's not right, nor is it PC, [but testes will always trump womb whilst this is the case.](http://www.lge.gov.uk/lge/core/page.do?pageId=119649#contents-2010-4)  You could try to address it with positive discrimination legislation, but that in practice tends to work by discriminating against the most qualified to the detriment of the whole.  True equality is never having to tick an ethnicity or gender box.

Thirdly, nobody really wants to issue cuts to front line services but the deficit is huge, times are bad and big cuts do need to be made somewhere.  Give or take a bit, this is the [UK budget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_budget#Planned_resource_budgets_2007.2F08).  Here, give or take, [are the taxes](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/UK_taxes.svg); you'll need to patch 2010 and 2011 budgets.

Choose.  Where's the £17.4 billion?  If you choose to cut corporate tax reductions and actually increase it by 5% making the UK around the top spot in the EU you're still looking for ~£14billion.  

Slashing maternity and paternity leave gets a knee jerk reaction but it would create jobs, make savings, improve equality, give a huge leg up to small-medium sized business and something has got to give.  Sorry wannabe mums.

                                                                                                 /DA

Maybe I've got Rose-colored glasses on, but she to me is just so freaking awesome: she realizes what she's got in her, far beyond what her background and job in a shop led her to believe. She's both selfish and selfless. She gets so much more out of life because of her travels. She helps save the universe multiple times, and once she starts doing it all by herself. 

Then again, Amy Pond is the bee's knees as well, and I really love how messed up she is and how she's grown over series 5 and 6. I sometimes think that Moffat, while absolutely brilliant and unmatched with plot, can be perhaps more heavyhanded than RTD with traumas: there are just one too many Rory deaths that pull character development out of Amy for me to be as drawn to them as I was the other companions. But I still like them, quite a lot, and I adore River. And Eleven himself is just sublime. Matt Smith really is a gem! :D

They are living legends as far as Chelsea goes. Most importantly though, pick a player that YOU care about. My first jersey was a Joe Cole home shirt, and though he has now moved on to Liverpool, he's still one of my favorite players, and I love the jersey.

If you are more budget conscious, you could always get last years kit (they are only $70 with name and number) or even get this years kit with no name/number. Whatever floats your boat I suppose.

Complementary medicine is ethically wrong in my opinion because ...

1. They charge a premium for something that has not been demonstrated to work beyond the placebo effect.

2. They 'magic up' science to 'explain' how their treatment is effective.

3. Some complementary treatments do more harm than good. Chiropractic in particular has been linked with high incidence of strokes and arterial damage. Some practitioners will actually issue medical advice to a patient - this can be good: ""keep taking your chemo"", or *bad*: ""don't vaccinate your children"" -  but the point is that someone who is not medically qualified is interfering in the health of another person.",0,1311846490,null,0,true,0,c28hixp,t3_j1x1y,t1_c28hixp,t1_c28hgrl,1427402710,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

Avoid Money Box and You and Yours unless you're really interested in the intricacies of British pensions e.t.c.
Pretty much everything else is good. Much of it superb. BBC radio 4 is the pinnacle of human achievement thus far. Your life is about to get a whole lot better.

Highly recommended:
Comedy.

Rather than writing detailed descriptions of each I will simply inform you here that they are all very funny and you should try them out. Some are off air, many are repeated on BBC radio 7.

*Bleak Expectations. Dickens Parody.

*Nebulous. Sci-Fi parody.

*The Now Show. Satire

*The News Quiz. Satire Panel show

(N.B both the Now show and the News Quiz amply demonstrate just how dated and breathtakingly unfunny wait wait don't tell me is.)

*That Mitchell and Webb sound. The guys who do the acting on peep show do the writing and the acting for this. Highly intelligent, sharp sketch show.

*I'm sorry I haven't a clue. Mornington crescent, 'nuff said.

*The department/ the consultants. Hard to find, but genius.

*Ed Reardon's week. From the view of a failed author, and master of the abusive e-mail.

*Just a minute. I'm not personally so keen on this one as it's quality depends in large part on the guests, but it does have a huge following and when it's good it is very good.

(N.B for non BBC British comedy podcasts I recommend, 'As it occurs to me' (filthy, immature, hilarious.) 'Answer me this' and of course 'the bugle.'

(Note that since so much british tv comedy starts off as radio it's a good idea to investigate to see if you're favourites have radio versions.)

NOT COMEDY.

*In our time. Possibly the best show on broadcast media anywhere in the world. Listening to just 40 mins a week actually increases your brain functionality by 170% (citation, science.)

*A history of the world in 100 objects Collaboration between the BBC and the British museum, each episode tells the story of one object in the museum and puts it in to a wider context. Also has a very good website (at BBC History website) where you can learn more about each object and view pictures.

*Witness First hand accounts of experiences of significant events in recent history. I like this one a lot.

*Science in Action – BBC World service The latest science news

*crossing continents' BBC foreign correspondents give reports, often around current news stories, which go more indepth than on the news bulletins.

*documentaries.' bbc world service the documentary archive, is updated fairly regularly, a real mixture of stuff, some of it duplications of other shows, some original programming.

*from our own correspondent. Basically the same as crossing continents in form, but the content is usually different.

*outlook' bbc radio 4/world service see 'crossing continents' and 'from our own correspondent.' Although this one often has a lighter tone and has matthew bannister presenting sometimes and he has a really good radio voice. Tends to be more uplifting than cc or fooc.

*today in parliament. self explanatory, I count this as one of my soaps. Worth listening to if you're interested in British politics.

*The archers. There may be times when you are filled with self-loathing and the desire to experience suffering. In such times the archers will be very useful to you.

*Arts and Ideas BBC radio 3 - Discussions about culture, history, politics etc. Often rather good.

*Forum - A word of ideas. BBC world service. Brings together different sorts of people, such as scientists, authors, etc, to discuss a central theme. Sometimes a bit disjointed as topics are shoe-horned together for the format, but usually nicely thought provoking.

*A point of view. Personal reflections on a current topic. Quality depends entirely on who the current presenter is.

*Profile each programme is about an individual in public life. A sort of 'before they're dead pre-obituary.'

*radio 4 choice The best of the week's documentaries.

*Thinking allowed BBC's flagship sociology programme, presented by the excellent Laurie Taylor. Really good.
All of the new output is good. From the today programme to the world tonight. For global news I like 'the bbc global news podcast'

Apologies for crappy formatting, as much of this is copy/pasted from emails sent to people who asked me to recommend podcasts previously and I am le tired. I have widened the remit to BBC radios 3, 7 and WS because much of their output is of 4 quality.

Edit. It is futile trying to list everything BBC radio 4 that you should be listening to, goodness knows the buggers would produce new excellent programming in the meanwhile if I tried. Start with in our time. Grow accustomed to the awesomeness. Then search for the podcasts, torrents and live radio feeds and indulge.

There's already the IWF proxy bullshit that screw up stuff like Oron.com, apparently under the pretence of stopping CP and ""obscene"" content even though it just seems to be trying to stop file-sharing.

If you're in the UK and on a large ISP, go to any file on Oron, try and download it and you'll most likely get that you've went above you're 10000MB limit. What supposedly happens is that the ISP puts all the traffic for that site through IWF proxies and then because everybody is trying to download from the same IPs, it runs over the limit and kills Free downloads from the site.

I don't really get why this hasn't received bigger attention tbh.

Also, it's a voluntary thing, the ISPs don't need to do this but some still have.

Now a last point that pisses me off every damned time I think about it. Who the Hell is some little busy-body to tell me what is obscene? It's not just that they're calling it obscene, it's the fact that they can fuck it up for people that do want to watch it is what pisses me off. You thinking something obscene, imho, is subjective; everybody will have a different opinion of what classifies for this and so why should a minority be allowed to judge it?

For example, blood play, that's one of this things that IIRC, classifies, as obscene and they try to filter out of the internet that I pay for. However, why is this filtered? If somebody wants to watch consenting adults cut one another and play with their blood, what is wrong with that and whom is somebody else to judge that based on their personal views?

**TL;DR** - IWF rapes certain download sites &amp; if somebody wants to watch blood play or similar, why should the IWF have the power to filter this out under the name of ""obscenity?",0,1311851138,null,0,false,0,c28hpuc,t3_j21aj,t1_c28hpuc,t1_c28hhay,1427402800,37,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,37

Are you seriously suggesting we should be more lax on clinical trials? Do you know anything about nasty some chemicals can be?

In some cases it might be justifiable, I don't know the details behind how it works and I am not medically educated. I do like knowing that any medicines I take are likely to be safe and that any side effects are known.

The monopoly is held using patents. Pharmaceuticals won't spend money on research unless they can get patents and make money out of it, and patents certainly are expensive to obtain.

They are businesses running for a profit, not charities. Since no one likes research into medicine and healthcare to be paid for by governments - especially in the US - this has to be lived with.

true,Marogian,eng-essex,Essex boy in London,"We *do* have the right to remain silent, but a jury may use silence to infer something when you try to defend yourself in court. Its not quite as broad as that though, the use of it is quite specific:

&gt;fails to mention any fact which he later relies upon and which in the circumstances at the time the accused could reasonably be expected to mention;

&gt;fails to give evidence at trial or answer any question;
fails to account on arrest for objects, substances or marks on his person, clothing or footwear, in his possession, or in the place where he is arrested; or

&gt;fails to account on arrest for his presence at a place.

Which doesn't seem that unreasonable. If a police officer asks you ""Why are you holding that rifle?"" and you're silent, and then in court you claim that you've actually been hunting, the jury can use your silence to infer that maybe, just maybe, you made up the hunting thing after the fact. its reasonable to say that you should have said this when the police officer asked you.

All three points are fairly similar. Its not as if just the act of being silent is incriminating (in fact the guidelines say very specifically this isn't true), it just means that if you later try to defend yourself in court with some explanation and the Jury believes you reasonably should have said it when first arrested then they can infer that you're likely to be lying.

You can't have your cake and eat it. Either stay silent the entire time, or just tell your story at the time and stick to it in court.

The right to silence is a historical aspect of Common law which was changed in 1994 and in fact its not even common in Europe. The Americans see it as a fundamental right; that's not the same here and I'm not sure it should be to be perfectly honest.

If I was in a jury and someone told a story which was perfectly reasonable, ie ""I only broke into the house because I thought it was mine!"" but the defendant had never ever said this before I'd be quite suspicious and I would be irked that I would not be able to use this to decide if the person was likely to be telling the truth.",0,1311859055,null,0,false,0,c28i66e,t3_j24ea,t1_c28i66e,t1_c28i4e6,1427403015,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

http://www.met.police.uk/stopandsearch/what_is.htm

http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/index/your_rights/legal_system/police_powers.htm

In a nutshell, the officer stopping you has to have a reason to search you, they can detain you on the street for a search, you only have to remove an outer jacket (and no other clothing). The officer has to provide you with their name or number and a receipt. You can ask to be searched somewhere private, or at a police station.

You can be cuffed during a search if the officer thinks that you may be a risk to them. If you run away you should expect to be rugby tackled. If you are arrested, you will be searched to make sure you are not carrying a weapon. If you attempt to swallow drugs you should expect a very unpleasant experience as your jaw is literally wrenched open and hands stuck down your throat (mostly to prevent you ODing).

As far as searching your property goes, if you were on the doorstep or halfway into your car when you get arrested then your house or car can be searched without a warrant, otherwise a warrant is needed to perform a search.

Thats probably all the pertinent info on searches.

They can arrest you if they have reasonable suspicion that you were about to, in the process of, or have just committed a criminal offence. They have the power to use ""reasonable force"" to do so, grabbing your arm is not assault, wailing on your face with a baton is.

If you are arrested you have the right to legal representation (who will tell you to say nothing but ""no comment"" during interview). You can be held for 24 hours (in total...) before being charged. So you can be arrested and interviewed, then bailed to return after X months and if you only spent 18 hours in the police station the police can hold you for a further 6 hours when you answer your bail.

Oh, on your arrest your DNA, photograph and personal details will be taken, as will your fingerprints. These will be kept until the heat death of the universe, unless by some miracle you manage to get them removed from the database.",0,1311859273,null,0,true,0,c28i6tp,t3_j24ea,t1_c28i6tp,t3_j24ea,1427403023,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

The characters were fleshed out -- you knew Rose's family and her motivations.  It was the same for Martha and then Donna.  The stories were good sci fi stories in that they examined such questions as ""what it means to be human"" and how your actions affect your relationships and the future.

I am on the 5th episode in the 5th year and I see none of that.  Comedy is sorely lacking and there is no depth to the relationships.  Big sci fi questions are not asked and not touched on.  I thought I used to hate Rose, but Amy Pond is the worst of the four companions I have seen. Is she just there for sex appeal?  We know nothing of her family, how she feels about anything, does she care for anybody else?  The Doctor's jokes fall flat, and I get a sense of busyness but not intensity.

It's also a bit crazy that Government systems are so locked down in security.  I did some work with the guys at HMRC whilst working on BusinessLink.gov.uk.

Someone talking about BusinessLink or HMRC on another website and they would have to rely on us to tell them what they said.  They were of course viewing it solely through IE6 as well.

There was also a level of security of accessing files that was ridiculous.  We weren't allowed to store any files on laptops in case they were stolen.  To login remotely you needed to know the password to get to the computer to turn on, a username and password to get into windows, a username and password to login to secure network and a remote radio controlled VPN key that was updated every 6s.

A state-owned company was usually beholden to their government minister. They were rarely allowed to borrow on the open market and had to seek government approval for every major decision.

Today if British Gas wants to borrow money, it goes to the debt market and does so. The decision is not based on whether the government can borrow the money or the whether the politician wants to spend the money on schools instead of pipelines, but if the debt market thinks British Gas' idea is a good one.

Likewise, if the firm needs to make 1,000 people redundant in the months approaching an election - they'll do so. Try getting a politician to agree to that for a state owned company!

Ultimately, I don't really care who the shareholder in a company is - private individual, pension fund or government. What I care about is that the management of the company run the company professionally as a company with the primary aim being to maximise the efficiency of the business.

The Isle of Dogs was in a terrible state until it received massive investment, and then it became a hub of investment, jobs and revitalisation.  Now, just a mile or so up the road, the same medicine has been applied.  There'll still be problems in the short distance between the city proper, Mile End and Stratford; Tower Hamlets will still be an issue, but large parts of the East End have recieved much needed life blood because of the Olympics, which probably couldn't have happened if there'd not been a rallying point like 2012.  The reason why that was chosen as the Olympic site after all is exactly because it was so open to much needed renovation.

It's a harder sell for other parts of the country but in reality the effects will have wider positive ramifications.

The thing that gets my goat is that when the ballyhoo of MPs and their mortgages, second London homes, was in the public eye there was the perfect opportunity to endorse the Australian system, where they have a hotel dedicated to MPs in Canberra.  Having spent billions on an Olympic site and providing all that living accommodation for athletes it should have been a mandatory obligation that a permanent hotel be built for the sole purpose of politicians attending Westminster after the event.  No more accommodation for second mortgages, no more tax relief - when you come to London there is subsidised accommodation a short trip away from the Houses of Parliament at a fraction of the cost and above corruption.

Sure. Just one example; the following Scottish Lib Dem MPs voted in favour of raising tuition fees in England:

* Jo Swinson
* Malcolm Bruce
* Danny Alexander
* Michael Moore
* Alistair Carmichael

[source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11964669) and [source](http://www.scotlibdems.org.uk/people/westminster). There may have been more Scottish Lib Dems that voted that way but I am not sure if the list has been updated since the most recent local government elections. 

Anything that involves spending money in England affects the [Barnett formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_formula), which dictates how much money the devolved governments get to spend on their own agenda. The Scottish MPs obviously have a conflict of interest in this regard - it is quite unfair they get to screw over English students in order to provide free tuition to their own (along with other stuff like free prescriptions).

The GDP per capita of Scotland and England are very similar, England - 35300 USD vs Scotland - 33680 USD [(source)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_subdivisions_by_GDP_per_capita_(nominal)). Christ knows what we (the English) spend the money on, if the Scots can afford stuff like this - or maybe the formula is unfair? Who knows. 

There is an argument about whether the income from North Sea oil fields should go directly to the Scottish government, but that isn't the point of my post.

Sometimes I think we rely on lampard to be a playmaker and box to box midfielder and a finisher all at the same time and it spreads him kind of thin at this age. If he plays alongside mikel or ramires in the deep role then he could have some opportunity to play up a bit or make some more forward runs.

true,[deleted],null,null,"That's the point.  Canary Wharf/the Isle of Dogs got massive investment, Ham, Stratford and Tower Hamlets didn't.


 London is rich but it is not ubiquitous.  There is massive prosperity in parts, such as the square mile of the City of London and Canary Wharf but, equally, there are massive parts of London which are/were incredibly impoverished in comparison to it, and other parts of the country, such as the 'far' East End and Tower Hamlets (near East End).  It was a rich city but with little parity.

What they've done is rather than shot gun blast all impoverished areas they've surgically struck a needle into some of the worst parts where investment would yield the greatest potential return.  There is a world of difference between West Kensington and Stratford, both of which are part of 'rich London' when it is seen as a whole.  Spend a little time in London and it quickly becomes apparent that London is more of a collection of communities than an homogeneous whole.  It also helps that Stratford and East London, through rail and air, are quickly becoming secondary rather than tertiary hubs to those coming to the capital, both overseas and domestic.  You can now fly into England's East London airport, or potentially arrive via the Channel Tunnel, and not think you've just arrived in a pseudo-post Soviet East European country or 1950s England.

England has most of the population, there are more English constituencies and they happen to vote Conservative and Lib Dem (more urban seats go to Labour).

Still, it's not as if the Scottish don't get their own back when it comes to tuition fees. Vote for increased fees in England (despite it having nothing to do with their constituencies), retain ""free"" tuition in Scotland.

In any case, what does this ruling have to do with the Conservatives? Cleanfeed (and similar systems by other ISPs) is a system set up at the behest of the **Labour** government to filter child porn. Fortunately plans to make it compulsory for all ISPs (that's a **Labour** idea) don't seem to have happened.

Look at the site.  It's not just sporting facilities; parks, walkways, transport, commercial buildings, everything.  All have been  rejuvenated.

 &gt;Isn't the issue wealth distribution, education, employment patterns?

That's EXACTLY it.  Wealth distribution in London, however rich the city is, hasn't been proportionate.   This puts wealth into disenfranchised areas and opens it up to future investment.  People would put their buck into an up and coming area but there were areas which had been left squandering.  This opens up a huge swathe of land, some of the most important land, to private investment because there's been a huge public movement.  You wouldn't open up a business in the old Isle of Dogs back then, now you would.  Now that this part of East London has undergone a makeover people are clamoring to invest.

&gt;I'm not against state investment. But if we are going to sink a lot of money into something it would be better to invest in something perhaps more worthy.

Well which area is more worthy?  I'm not against the more shot gun blast analogy but if you're going to do a precise strike it would have to be in one of the more built up areas.  Other UK cities ran for 2012,  London, when pitched, got the UK bid.  The UK bid got the world bid.

&gt;There are hundreds of things we could have done with the money universities, science, transport. Even a national sports programme.

There are, and that's a slightly different argument.  The UK went with an Olympics bid and whether or not the money could have been better spent elsewhere, it doesn't change that the UK Olympics will deliver positive results in a direction.  The direction could have been different, but the direction the UK went with the London Olympics will still deliver positive results.

&gt;The return looks so low and short term in a place rich but unequal. The money coming from a country that is feeling poor and broke from the mistakes of the very place that tapped them for a bail out.

That's the thing.  Don't think of London being rich and that therefore all parts of London were rich.  It is not.  They were not.  Large parts of the major income for the UK (London) were not rich.  

We can argue whether the bid should have gone to Manchester or Birmingham, but it didn't.  It went to London and despite discussions on where emphasis should be placed, it will deliver positive yield.",0,1311875301,null,0,false,0,c28k61y,t3_j1hjo,t1_c28k61y,t1_c28jfun,1427403955,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So, when my black day came, I went and asked him to help me… I’ll never forget what it was like up there. All bleak and cold, it was, a few bare rocks with some weeds sprouting from them and some pathetic little patches of sludgy snow. It was just grey. Grey, grey, grey. The tree the old man sat under was ancient and twisted, the old man himself - he was as brittle and as dry as a leaf in autumn… He just sat there, silently, expressionless, and he listened while I poured out my troubles. I was too unhappy even for tears, I remember. When I’d finished, he lifted a skeletal hand and he pointed. Do you know what he pointed at?
A flower. One of those little weeds. Just like a daisy it was. I looked at it for a moment and suddenly I saw it through his eyes. It was simply glowing with life like a perfectly cut jewel, and the colours were deeper and richer than you could possibly imagine. It was the daisiest daisy I’d ever seen.
Later, I got up and ran down the mountain and I found that the rocks weren’t grey at all. They were red and brown, purple and gold. And those pathetic little patches of sludgy snow were shining white in the sunlight!”

If the group doesn't want to see it, then they shouldn't go looking for it. For example, I'm not exactly exactly fond of all the foot fetishism stuff out there but I respect that other people like it so I don't look for it because I don't want to see it and others that do can still view it, neither party is bothered.

My other issue with the group thing is that with that attitude, where is the line drawn without compromising an individual's freedom? *Well, already it's compromising a freedom to view such material if you wish to just because a certain group disagrees with it.*

I think the cats and dogs as food products example works both ways in this argument depending on what side you're on because to me that also proves *my* point. If I wanted to eat those animals I couldn't because the larger group disapproves based on societal norms and what's really to say that they are correct in believing to not eat those certain animals? Then of course there's the thought of that other regions will eat these so who is correct in their certain belief?

That's the sort of thing that makes me hate the idea of norms so long as nobody is harmed by what you're choosing to do. *(Or, to tie in with the earlier example before it's pointed out, so long as it's consensual and between adults.)* Imo, no one group should be more correct than the other in these views so why not leave it up to the individual to make up their own mind?",0,1311877286,null,0,false,0,c28kgpj,t3_j21aj,t1_c28kgpj,t1_c28k8aa,1427404094,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Then there is no problem with redeploying labour, and yet we also avoid the apparent problems from the private ownership of these industries.

The model you espouse would either require businesses to run with a surplus to be able to absorb the redundancies elsewhere, which is inefficient - or a generous benefits system which would then need some form of stick to encourage people back to work.

Splitting the two...

Businesses should be run as efficiently as possible, as an inefficient business is not just wasteful, but is a tax on its customers who themselves have to raise prices to cope with their suppliers. That then drags down the entire economy, affecting employment and taxes from profits.

No company should ever operate as a proxy for the state by being required to step in to deliver political promises.

However, the state can then step in to spend the taxes raised from an efficient economy to support those who are unable to work.

&gt; In March 2010, a British judge found Newzbin guilty of deliberately indexing copyrighted content.[1] Chris Elsworth, the main operator of Newzbin, had said repeatedly at trial that he had no knowledge of infringement occurring on the service, and that Newzbin's categories for ""CAM,"" ""screener,"" ""telesync,"" ""DVD,""R5 retail"",""Blu-ray,"" and ""HD DVD"" didn't suggest any evidence of infringement. The judge was highly critical of Elsworth, stating that he found his testimony ""simply not credible""

Google, Bing et al make an effort to appear to be about indexing legitimate content.  Their business model would not suffer at all if they could find a way to eliminate all the piracy.  

As for the creeping level of censorship - you have a point.  The problem is that this is not the responsibility of the government - who had no input into this, or the ISP - who did at least fight against it.

My political views could be summed up as ""leave us alone as much as possible, please"" (which is an anathema to most left wing ideologies popular on here, which I believe are ultimately typified by a desire to micromanage). 

I actually think this set of views fits in very well with technologies that allow you to make your own stuff, or to buy stuff your mate or your neighbour made. 

I agree that this sort of technology is going to be a death-knell for many of the multinationals, except those that supply energy, minerals, or food. That's not a bad thing. The world will on average, be a happier place without sweatshops in China, India, and Thailand working people to death to sell cheap crap no one really needs. When you can make it at home, why ship it from the other side of the planet? 

Some companies will re-purpose themselves, like pharmaceutical manufacturers who originally arose from dye companies around the turn of the last century. But a lot of them are simply going to get sold off in chunks. If anyone will have the chunks that is.

You might be able to put together a printer capable of making a printer, and give them to all your friends...but can you teach them how to use one? Can you explain to them how to design, manufacture and assemble an iPhone from raw ingredients? Many people struggle to follow the instructions that come with Ikea furniture.

I've worked with a few additive process technologies before, and many of them are still at the 'great solution waiting for a problem' stage. The only one that's really taken off is printed electronics.

The problem with many such 'disruptive' manufacturing techniques is they need a lot of technical knowledge to use, effectively limiting their appeal to hobbyists and enthusiasts rather then the general public. While they put production into the hands of the masses they also destroy the efficiency and quality benefits gained by making many of a thing in a single place.

The irony of claiming that these technologies will lead to some sort of revolution against mega-corporations is that it is those same corporations who are at the fore-front of developing them, and who'd get the most benefit from them.

I should clarify, Dogbotherer and I have argued about this many times before. I agree with your position, these machines are going to remain very expensive for a long time, and the raw materials situation isn't going to be changed by them. And neither is the design issue. The type of world Dogbotherer is talking about is something my grandkids will have to worry about, not me. What I believe is that this type of technology could well alter world trade substantially, as it will kill off a lot of jobs and allow manufacturing to take place close to home than it does today. But corporations will still be around as they are going to be the only people with the ability to get the resources, technology and knowhow in the same place, at the same time.

&gt; The problem with many such 'disruptive' manufacturing techniques is they need a lot of technical knowledge to use, effectively limiting their appeal to hobbyists and enthusiasts rather then the general public. While they put production into the hands of the masses they also destroy the efficiency and quality benefits gained by making many of a thing in a single place.

The same thing was said about computers to begin with. And even in my lifetime they have gone from being machines a few geeks would buy to a world where my train ride to work has more computing power on it than a decently equipped computer science facility contained when I was a kid. I would also agree that for the foreseeable future this type of technology is going to be limited to industry alone. But I can also envision a world where you buy a device like this from Amazon, and then you have a Kindle that makes basic items for you if you order them. 

In short, I don't agree with Dogbotherers interpretation of how this technology will change the world, but I do think it will be revolutionary.

I think that's true at the present time, albeit [things are developing rapidly and will continue to do so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control#DIY.2C_hobby.2C_and_personal_CNC); additionally of course, it's not so much the ability to put one into every home (although that may come, certainly for less complicated designs and requirements), but the ability for small scale entrepreneurs to tool factories for orders of magnitude less capital, and to target local markets more competitively than larger scale long supply chain mass-production outfits.

It's like a little medical boost, yes... but he stayed the same person, in the same regenerated form as he already was in. So it's not new.

Beginning to regenerate [as in the verb] and BEING a regeneration [as in the noun] are different things.

I thought you were arguing that because the extra regeneration energy ended up creating a new him, you could arguing that the extra Doctor/Donna is his ""11th regeneration""? But now that you've responded, I don't really get that feeling anymore.

In case you WERE thinking that anyway, my argument against that is that although he has all of his memories and the most of his personality [plus that of Donna's], he is a different person. Literally a different entity with a different mindset and a completely different future. It's like having a twin. You're connected to that person, but you aren't that person, whereas regenerations stack up on top of one another so that, while you appear to change into another being, you're actually the same person at the core. You can't wander off and do separate things from the previous regeneration because you're carrying that past regeneration within you, not parting ways with them.

Other things to remember? 

Halls is stupidly expensive, but uni flats are really very cheap (for edinburgh). When you get a flat, don't pay more than about £310/month as you will end up choosing between eating and housing by the end of the year unless you have rich and generous parents. 
If you are in kings buildings, anything north of pollock halls is to far away. If you are in george square, anything north of queen street is too far away. If you are in kings buildings AND george square, budget in a ridacard (£36/month) when choosing your flat. The free bus will always be full when you are in a hurry.

There is a society for pretty much everything. Many contain an instructor who is late twenties/early 30's. He will almost invariably be male, arrogant and willing to sleep with 18 year olds. 
There are also many non-university societies. Some of these are incredibly strange, but can also be much much more fun than the uni ones. Related to this, on halloween go and watch samhuin celebrations on the royal mile, and on april 31st, beltane celbrations on carlton hill. It's quite an experience. When offered a hand rolled cigarette at these events, be aware its probably a spliff no matter what size or shape it is.

It's pretty much impossible to fail first year unless you do absolutely zero work, so make use of this to get all the partying out of your system. If you want a suggestion as to which bars to try, well you have 4 years, go experiment yourself.

On further looking, you want nice places to walk? As said, the pentlands and arthurs seat. Best way to get to the pentlands is to take the no. 10 bus. Also rosyln glen is nice and a lovely place for wild camping. You can get a first bus over to tyningham beach, or a lothian bus to the beach up in portabello. The hermitage at braid is lovely for a short walk, and has the quarry which is great for bbq's. There is also a canal which has a lovely path alongside it for city centre walks. A fun challenge is to do the seven hills. Don't do this in your first week, there is way too much other fun stuff to do.

Oh, and a problem I found when I was a fresher, you cannot turn off north bridge to get to the cowgate, whatever it may look like on google maps. There is a bridge there, you have to go round and down.

Ok, um, what else...

If you like little kookie, interesting shops, the grassmarket and cockburn street is the place to go. Incidentally, so you don't sound like a wally, thats pronouced co-burn. 

Haggis is secretly delicious, yes, you do have to eat it, yes you will probably eat it deep fried when drunk, no, there is no way to avoid it and going yuck without trying it will make you look like a tourist. Deep fried mars bars are also delicious, but for the real connoisseur, go for the deep fried curly wirly. They are less likely to make you violently sick.
When making your budget, include at least £300 for freshers week drinking, and at least £100 for joining clubs in case you want to join something expensive (most are only £3, but the more equipment it needs, the more it costs). Bear in mind, everyone joins the chocolate society, hardly anyone goes to more than one meeting. Do not bother.

Many computer labs are open 24/7. Woohoo! Resnet (the university internet) is horrible in every possible way. Resnet is the only internet in halls of residence and university flats. This is a good reason to move to private accommodation. Don't forget to factor internet costs into the cost of the flat.

MyEd is your lord and master now. Check is every day, and always check it as late as possible before you head to lectures in case of class cancellations. Also check the notice boards, as lecturers live in the 18th century apparently and cannot work the internet. The classics department is particularly bad (if they run any of your courses, depending on which ones you choose). Don't rely on the lecture slides going up on webct. A dictaphone is a brilliant thing to have, even if you are not dislexic as you can listen back to what you will almost invariably miss. Incidentally, webct is the anus of anuses. Your lecturer will not be able to use it, but each one will mess it up in unique and interesting ways. There is nothing you can do about this. (If you don't know what webct is yet, you will find out when you confirm all your courses in freshers week)

Do not expect much sleep in first year if you have 9am lectures. On the other hand, as a history student you probably wont start before 11am (damn history students). This is good. It means you can make use of the fact that most pubs have cheap drinks on weekdays. TBH in first year you can do that even if you do have 9am lectures. Make it to half and you'll still probably pass.

Umm.. Oh, go to Monster Mash for dinner some time. It's great! Frankensteins bar is worth a look once, but the prices are astronomical. 

Oh, and it doesn't matter where you go, or how many places say ""the birthplace of harry potter"" on signs outside, you will probably not meet j k rowling. Other edinburgh authors are a little easier to run across though, though certain scifi authors are easily embarrassed by squealing fanboys.

There are loads of little hidden gems all over the city. 
Anteaques is a tea shop/antiques shop on nicolson street and is.... uniquely wonderful.
Sadly you will miss the forest cafe and the big red door, but the bongo club is still going strong.

true,TX1138,pertwee,Pertwee,"Just four things:

Firstly, the Reapers are set loose by a VERY specific chain of events in *Father's Day*. Rose and the Doctor aren't only present, they're present twice. Rose is directly related to the man she saves and has memories of his death. Rose's actions cause her (and the Doctor's) original self to fizzle out of existence. That doesn't happen every time someone changes history (such as in *A Christmas Carol*), it's very specific to that episode.

Secondly, I will have to disagree with you about RTD's Era being intrinsically more 'adult' than Moffat's Era. RTD's Who was very much focused on big emotional moments, often at the expense of the plot. This results in episodes such as 'Boom Town', 'Doomsday', 'Last of the Time Lords', 'Journey's End' and 'The End of Time', where Russell repeatedly writes himself into corners, and is forced to resort to enormous cop-out resolutions to otherwise compelling situations. Scenes like Pete/Mickey/Jackie being able to teleport just in time to save Rose/Sarah Jane from the Void/Daleks, Floaty-Glowing Messiah Doctor, the Doctor-Donna's 'magical keyboard' solution to the Reality Bomb that serves only to reduce both Davros and the Daleks to a laughing stock, Donna's unintentionally hilarious mind-explosion powers that adds nothing to the plot and raises a huge number of safety concerns, and the previously unhinted-at third target that allows the plot to resolve itself without the Doctor being forced to make any moral judgement call whatsoever from 'The End of Time: Part 2' are all symptoms of a writer who appears to use plot in order to string together his (admittedly amazing) big emotional character moments.

One of Moffat's greatest strengths (IMO) is his ability to lay out a strong, cohesive plot, with elements that all tie together in order to create a satisfying resolution. For instance, 'A Christmas Carol' sets out a number of key plot points;

1. There is crippled Star Cruiser that needs saving from dangerous fog.
2. The planet is inhabited by fish that swim in this fog.
3. There is a flying shark that has swallowed part of the Doctor's sonic.
4. The fog is controlled by Kazran's weather machine using sonic waves.
5. Abigail's singing resonates with the ice-crystals that make up the fog.

All these parts, entertaining in their own right, go on to form the resolution to the story. This can also be seen in many of Moffat's other stories, but one thing of *critical* importance is that many of the plot elements are now forming over the period of *2 whole series*  as opposed to a 45-90 minute story. As such, the hugely emotional character moments that were such a large part of the RTD era now often find themselves attached to key plot points, and are thus treated with less emotional fanfare. I've seen people complain that Moffat's stories 'aren't as good as they used to be', but I've always argued that the beauty of a Moff-penned story is the way in which the various elements come together to form the conclusion. As of now, we have yet to have witnessed the conclusion to Moffat's epic 26-part serial, and are being forced to judge an incomplete story. It's as futile as watching parts 1-4 of *Inferno* and criticizing the story for being wholly unsatisfying. 

Thirdly, I prefer the new TARDIS Console Room. It's bigger, has a better sense of 'openness' to it (mostly thanks to the stairs leading off to different parts of the interior), and looks [fantastic](http://i.imgur.com/vnFFQ) when lit correctly.

Fourthly, I too hate the new Daleks; an opinion I apparently share with Mark Gatiss, Steven Moffat and Nicholas Briggs.

**TL;DR:** Davies stories tend to be focused around amazing character moments strung together by wafer-thin plot. Moffat stories (of which Series 5 &amp; 6 are a part of) tend to be focused around a strong plot, with smaller character moments that revolve around plot points. I like the new TARDIS Console Room, and dislike the new Daleks.

Yes.

&gt; will 3D printing sound the death knell for mass production?

No.

The great thing is, from a mass production POV, you can do much smaller production runs.  Parallels here are with the printing industry.  When it was a hot lead based process, you needed a very large print run to justify the cost of typesetting and setting up the printer.  Since anyone with a copy of Word and a laser printer can produce passable documents, a print run of 1, 2, or a couple of dozen is perfectly reasonable.   Mainstream publishing still exists.  The printing press will only be made obsolete wirth the elimination of paper.

I imagine this will be somewhat specialised at first, with companies offering limited print ruins to order.  Similar to the cafepress business model.  Whether there's ever a demand for a home 3D printer remains to be seen.  

Of course the technology does need to improve somewhat.  I've seen thwe output from these.  It's pretty good.  We even had moving parts, but it needs some improvement.

true,Super-Tramp,lfc99,null,"I kind of agree with this. After all the talk of Mata coming to Liverpool, it was pretty exciting. Now it looks like Arsenal have snatched a brilliant player.

I'ts glaringly obvious we need a new CB and LB. Firstly, a CB - IF we offload some of the players you mentioned, hopefully we can land Scott Dann.

In regards to buying a LB, unless Henry and co want to spend more of their own cash, I honestly dont know who we will get. All of the best left backs (who will probably want to play in the champions league) will cost 15-25m, and we wont make that much from selling players.


But, regardless of that, I am happy with the transfer window so far. Downing - has had a great season last year, will supply us with assists and goals, and most importantly, a bundle of chances.

Henderson is, honestly, a fantastic talent. He will be a big international player in the future. Jordan has come to the right place to exploit all of his talents and he is a rare player who is absolutely dedicated to the game.

Adam - There are no denying he is a good footballer. No, he wont take Lucas place, as they play different roles. We paid 6.5m, which i think, is a steal. He seems to be a very nice guy, and will be an excellent squad player.


We need not be disappointed by our results as of late. The galatasary and hull (first half) games were quite hard to watch, but what did we expect? Poulson, Degen, Cole, Kyrgiakos, Shelvey etc were all playing. Most of them wont even get on the bench next season.

Not wanting to say anything negative about those players, they're Liverpool players after all, but I don't think they're good enough. Poulsen, Cole, Degen, Jovanovic (although he might be off soon), etc. 

As for the player's we've bought, I'm a bit puzzled as to what the preferred first team is going to be. But at least having so many quality midfielders is a nice problem to have, for now. I'm also not very confident about our CB situation. I'm a fan of Skrtel, but Agger is injury-prone, Kyrgiakos has proven to be error-prone in the last 6 months, Carragher's age might become an issue this year although I'm hoping not, and Kelly, Wilson, Ayala etc may have potential but.. They've all been very nervous when playing CB and I think they're just a bit too young and inexperienced at the highest level. Strangely, I don't think that LB is a priority because Johnson can play there with Kelly as RB, although of course a left-footed player would be preferred and Johnson is also going to be more effective on the right. Flanagan and Robinson are very decent backups. So I guess that, ideally, I'd like us to buy a strong, tall, physical LB who can also cover for CB if needed.

EDL do their best to soak up a fair amount of tax-payers hard-earned... A quick trawl, by no means exhaustive, gave me these figures for the policing of EDL demos:

23 January 2010 – Policing Hanley EDL protest - £200,000

9 October 2010 – Policing Leicester EDL protest - £715,22515.
(Leicester City Council estimated that their operation cost a total of £137,000. Some businesses are said to have reported a decline in takings of between 40 – 70%.)

27 Nov 2010 – Policing Warwickshire EDL protest - £250,000

27 November 2010 - Policing Preston EDL protest - £350,000, 

5 March 2011 – Policing Rochdale EDL protest – £300,000

2 April 2011 – Policing Blackburn EDL protest - £625,000 

21 May 2011 - Policing Blackpool EDL protest £400,000.

Now it's certainly the price of democracy that we pay for demos to be policed, and it's also fair to point out that the policing encompasses the anti-fascist protestors too. But they have a lot of protests and they cost a lot of money.

We also have a problem with people who think that the NHS is the absolute tipity-tip peak of human achievement, that we can do no better and that all other systems are vastly inferior.  

The problem with the NHS is that everyone makes it into a political issue, we can't talk about it without people resorting to hyperbole and insults. It has problems, the wait time for my issue is terrible, as is the lack of communication, the fact that they still do everything on real dead tree based paper filing, the inability for disparate parts to talk to each other or share records, and that your basically stuck with the treatment your given. But it's also not a bad system at the core of it. 

So to answer you question, the funding issue I would see as a matter of necessary cuts, no matter which way you cut it we're spending more than we raise in taxes each year and cuts have to be made. How they are made is less of a central government issue than we are lead to believe, the PCT's are give a huge amount of freedom to make them and I can't see a reality where Cameron et al gave specific orders to let people die existing.

On ITV it was World of Sport and then Saint and Greaves.

Both the BBC and ITV stopped showing all live football in 1992 when Sky Sports gained the exclusive rights to broadcasting English football.  

Admittedly this was a time when there were only 4 channels so you couldn't expect the BBC to dedicate a channel to live football like Sky do.  And for that reason, I don't dispute the fact that there's much, much more live football on Sky than there ever was on the BBC or ITV.

But what precious live football there was on terrestrial TV disappeared overnight when Sky priced both BBC and ITV out of the bidding in 1992.  I think it's reasonable to describe that as ""taking football"".

You only have to read through the [Sky Sports Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports) to see how many sports they own the *exclusive* broadcast rights to for major competitions.

Funnily enough, even *when throttled*, Virgin Media still gets you better value than an unthrottled adsl connection. They do throttle though but they are very transparent about it, check out here:

http://shop.virginmedia.com/help/traffic-management/traffic-management-policy.html (see the table halfway down the page - and the fastest package isn't affected at all)

And also http://shop.virginmedia.com/help/traffic-management/traffic-management-faster-uploads.html for people with faster upload speeds (depending on which area you're in) - there's a tiny amount of throttling there but only if you use over 6GB in a 5 hour window, and the decrease isn't that bad considering the speed you usually get.

In my opinion this throttling is perfectly ok, it's no big secret that the internet is at peak capacity at certain times of days - so would you rather:

a) Pay more for your connection *all the time* because the networks have to be able to support massive data transfer at peak times and be massively under-used the rest of the day.

or b) Pay the prices you do now and have good service *except at a certain time of day* when your internet access become intermittend and possibly grinds to a near halt.

or c) Pay the prices you do now and have a small amount of throttling at peak times to prevent oversaturation and bad service - you get slowed if you transfer massive amounts in that window, but it stays reliable.

I'd definitely pick c) over the other 2.

At the end of the day, if they didn't throttle at these times they'd have to run a more expensive network and that cost would be passed right along to you - and if you're willing to pay more to not be throttled then you *can* because they offer such a package!",0,1311956739,null,0,false,0,c28s4qg,t3_j34vl,t1_c28s4qg,t1_c28qj1d,1427407773,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,KTPone,null,null,"I agree with you.  I loved how their stories pulled me in.  I don't experience that with Smith.  There was so much emotion in those stories and these, though well-crafted, leave me cold.  Why is that, I've pondered?  I've kind of settled on two things.  One, as you mention below, is character development.  In the RTD years, there were little bits dropped here and there in the episodes, therefore developing the characters' histories and personalities.  We came to know who there were, so that when decisions had to be made, we could feel their struggles.  Moffat's intent, as stated below, may be to build it over time, but, in my opinion, it is not happening.  I am only on S5/E5, but the characters are blank to me.  I think he could do more to do as RTD did, give me something to hang on to, to wonder, to watch develop.  I also feel the pacing lacks.  S5/E1 started out wonderful and drew me in, then rapidly decelerated and lost me.  I fell asleep in the second half of the weeping angel one, something that did not happen with Eccleston &amp; Tennant.  I'm thinking the direction could be part of the problem.

Oh, and I don't like the new TARDIS either.  I liked the quirky-ness of it seemingly being held together by spit and prayer.  This one's like a nice shiny pinball machine.  Not bad, but without personality, which is how I feel about the Doctor and Amy at this juncture.

Doctor Who's an edge case and we've had lots of conversations and learnings from it, and you can expect to see improvements in the future.

For now, your best bet to find the specials is to look in the Similar Titles sections, End of the World 1 &amp; 2 and the Waters of Mars should hopefully be there.

They are a fairly good team, by our standards anyway &amp; even played against the Boston Bruins last year! Nothing like NHL level, or even the AHL, but usually very atmospheric! Plus there is bars/clubs/food/entertainment surrounding the arena within the building!

I understand completely.  So here are some ideas I have.  And I'm from the US so it might be different in you live in the UK.

1) Doctor Who didn't get really get popular until like 2 years ago.  I dress up as the 4th doctor at a con 3 years ago and not that many people knew who I was and I ended up having to explain what Doctor Who was.  So I feel like they view Smith as the Doctor.  Maybe possible, I don't know.

2)  I've always felt like there has been this weird loyalty to the current doctor.  It took me until half way through series 3 to really really Like Tennant.  Because I felt like his acting had finally go to what I was craving, that dark broken soul thing, which is why I really latched on to 9.

3)  Newer viewer don't want to spend the time and effort to watch the old who.  After just a couple story arches I was beginning to like 1.  But when I watched the Movie was like wtf.  But then I listened to 8's audio plays and fell in love and I mean HARD.  So I think people don't have a full developed understanding of the doctor.  All they know is this one or just the last 3.

4)  I""m sure there is something to be said about his youthfulness.  But screw that.  I feel he's less handsome than the last 3, 5 and 8 are amazing. and for the daddy complex in me I love 4.

5) There is that ""first doctor"" thing.  What's the phrase, You never forget your first doctor.

I don't really like him.  I think he his acting has gotten better, but fuck man I feel it's sub-par compared to most.

But yeah, I can understand that. I remember people in the states going absolutely mad when Tennant went up on the stage for ComicCon, and same thing with Barrowman actually. But now is it that people are just bleeding in through the whole time lines, and thinking that the new episodes are the only ones? That's the part I don't understand. It's where people call themselves ""True Who Fans"" but never seen the originals. I told one guy, who claimed to know everything about Doctor Who, that in the original Series that the Time Lords were still alive, and the Doctor frequently visited Gallifrey. He lost it and claimed that those episodes were not the true episodes, only the Russel T Davies/Moffat era is the real Doctor Who. Is that what these people are doing?

2. I personally find *Vampires of Venice* to be a total bore, but it must be said that the whole 'simple solution to complex problem' is also present in author Toby Whitehouse's other story, *School Reunion*, where Mickey simply switches off the power to the school computers. In both cases, it was neither an RTD nor a Moffat issue. However, there is a world of difference between Donna's magical keyboard, and Abigail's singing. The former comes completely out of left field; at no point is the control terminal even *mentioned* in the proceeding 75 minutes, and Donna's amazing Timelord powers are only brought into existence a mere seconds beforehand. It feels lazy because it comes out of nowhere, and when combined with the DoctorDonna's flippancy to the whole situation completely negates *all* the tension built up over the past two stories.  With the latter, Abigail's ability to resonate with the ice crystals is brought into play very early on, and assists in moving the story forward. It is a part of her character from the very beginning, and in the end the Doctor is able to use her, along with all the other pieces of the puzzle, to provide the solution to the main problem presented in the story. Put simply, one was explained early on, and would form a *part* of the solution, wheras the other came out of nowhere, and was the *entire* solution. All those subplots about 'warp stars' and 'ostahargan keys' were all subplots that *should* have been important pieces of the puzzle, but ended up hitting a dead end and going nowhere. (I felt) It was a disappointing conclusion to a disappointing second half to a *wonderful* set-up in the previous two stories. I feel very similarly about *Last of the Time Lords*.

Tenant and Eccleston are both outstanding actors in there own right but with Smith I feel like he becomes the doctor rather than just playing him.

You cannot compare racism to rape. Especially a comedian being 'racist'.

As I said in my previous statement. A lot of my 'friends' put me in my place where it comes to me joking about race.

true,PhysicsPhil,null,null,"ISTM that the solution would be to either devolve the same matters in England too (which would produce something more like a federal system), to fully merge the scottish legal system with that of England (and correct the imbalance in the size of constituencies), or make Scotland into a Commonwealth Realm (on the conditions that it join Schengen, perhaps retains a common currency, and allows access to the fleet bases and airfields).

I think that full independence might lead to problems when the oil runs out, and a full merging of the two countries (essentially completing the process begun in the Act of Union) would be politically improbable.

Personally, I would prefer a federal solution (with the UK split into the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, the Principality of Wales, and whatever we want to call Northern Ireland), with the Westminster government responsible for defence, foreign affairs, the national curriculum, the NHS, welfare, and transport coordination, and similar items. The regional governments could then fund everything else, with funding provided as a share of general revenue based on the proportion contributed by that region.

In such an arrangement, it would make sense to move the capital of England to, say, Birmingham (as it is the next-largest city, it is well connected by air, the west coast main line, and motorways, and it is more central than London), with an area approximately corresponding to Greater London split off into a special capital district (like the Australian Capital Territory, rather than like the District of Columbia, which would be more equivalent to splitting off just Westminster).

It might be better to split England into two regions, with, say, Liverpool or Manchester as southernmost city in the northern region, in order to better balance the populations, but the regions shouldn't be so small that they become barely more than a few counties either (except Northern Ireland, for obvious reasons).",0,1311989363,null,0,false,0,c28w4c6,t3_j21aj,t1_c28w4c6,t1_c28k8au,1427409724,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

A lot of talk about how they are unelected - I voted in the EU election, never voted for the house of lords though.

There's pros and cons of course but most of our trade is with the EU and I'm glad to be in. I should add that i'm by no means a great traveller, having only been to the Euro zone once since it came in, but there you go.

I think anti-EU opinion is fine when it is informed, as I say there are pros and cons.  But I do get annoyed when people do not seem to realise that the EU is not the same as the European court of human right or the council of Europe.  Both pro and anti EU opinion is mostly uninformed IMO.

He'd probably be higher if I enjoyed his stories more, but I didn't really enjoy series 5 and series 6 has just been okay, for the most part. I don't think he's a bad actor at all, I think he just plays the Doctor in a very unique way. I think the one thing about him that I don't get that everyone else seems to, is Eleven's ""anger."" Even in his angry scenes, he never seems that angry to me. I don't think it's bad acting, I think they're maybe just going for a subtle rage that I have a hard time picking up on.

But I think a lot of it has to do with how insanely popular Doctor Who is right now. I mean it's always been popular, it's always been worldwide, but it's gaining a crazy audience in the US now and getting pop culture mentions left and right, and Matt Smith is like, the surfer riding this majestic wave. Know what I mean? That's just how I'm viewing it.

And obviously this isn't everyone, but there is a small handful of rabid fanboys/fangirls who can't deal with the fact that not everyone worships Eleven, and/or Amy Pond, and/or River Song, like they do. It doesn't matter how politely, how respectfully, or how thoughtfully you say it, if you express an opinion that is negative towards one of these three, you will get one or two downvotes, at least.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It isn't perfect but it's definitely a step in the right direction.

I used to be all for a federal Europe as one state but if you think about it we already have it. What's more an actual nation state would be impossible to maintain and any strong democratic government would be impossible.

So for now this is the best game in town. We have massive amounts of trade and labour being moved throughout all the countries of the EU, primarily among the largest economies of course. We have wealth trickling down to places like Poland, the Balkans, Baltic states and so on through workers from their migrating to places like the UK, Germany and France to earn money which they send back home.

**80% of Britain's trade is from Europe.**

We also have massive amounts of military co-operation through NATO to safeguard European borders. A lot of people will argue that you don't *need* to safeguard European borders but I think that it is primarily because we *do* have a massive military presence that we are not challenged for land and resources, at least for now.

We have incredible amounts of scientific co-operation between member states helping develop technologies and projects to benefit us all.

For the most part we even have a common culture a white, secular, capitalist Europe with socialist leanings.

Compare a Europe 70 years ago - enveloped in utterly total war between the major nations of the day resulting in tens of millions dead civilian or otherwise and the worst cases of ethnic cleansing the world has ever seen. This war weakened the continent of Europe for years to the point that even her most powerful nation - Britain became a pawn of the United States, unable to enforce its will around the world as it once had without opposition 20 years before. The European economy was dead.

Compare that to now. We've had no major wars in Europe for the past 70 years and only a few limited conflicts in several flashpoints in places like Yugoslavia. We have unparalleled growth in the European economy, as well as in science and technology and a voice, as a continent on the world stage.

Other major powers no longer deal with France, or Germany, or Britain now. They deal with Europe.

In Europe we have only one dictatorship left - Belarus.

We are reborn. We are united. We are Europeans. The last time our continent was so unified was under the Roman Empire. I'm sure they'd be proud.

Opponents of the EU, in my opinion, are largely very ignorant of other people in it. Having worked in a student's union bar I have met a myriad number of different nationalities and gotten along with many of them...apart from the French but they're alright.

As time goes on I think this idea that European migrants are taking British jobs and sucking our social state dry will dissipate. The overall wealth in Europe will grow and grow, until it finds an equilibrium across the entire continent. Many hostile to British integration into the continent still have the mind set that the British Empire never disintegrated. It is very much dead, as are all the great European empires. We must now integrate ourselves into this new European community fully, that need not mean the end of British statehood.

The only thing I would say is that we shouldn't jump over to the Euro just yet - the recent economic crisis showed a distinct weakness in one currency for a whole continent.",0,1312010541,null,0,true,0,c28xyic,t3_j3r8z,t1_c28xyic,t3_j3r8z,1427410588,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

You'd need to check with your accountant, but it may be the computer counts as a ""capital purchase"", in which case it counts as an asset which must be ""depreciated"" over say 5 years - ie if your computer costs £1000 you can offset £200 per year against tax for 5 years - which is a major bore.

My understanding (and what I do) is that if you buy computer components and build your own computer then it doesn't count as a capital purchase and you can offset the cost of the components against tax in the first year.

If you're VAT registered, you also claim back the VAT you paid on the computer (but then obviously you can't offset the reclaimed VAT against tax later).

Personally, I don't have that many ""receipts"" in a given year so I just have a box by my desk to put them in and at the end of my financial year I file all the receipts for that year in an envelope. I record the business expenses seperately in a spreadsheet which I used to give to my accountant (I now do my accounts myself).

Edit: If you also use your business computer for personal use, you'll be expected to make an allowance for this in your accounts. Say your computer is 50% for personal use then you'd be expected to only claim 50% of the cost against tax. (Check with your accountant).

true,frenchphrasebook,null,null,"Irishman here and I've come across a fair amount of anti-English behaviour. In my experience it is concentrated in the border counties from Donegal around to Louth. If you look at our election results, this is where you see the lion's share of the support for Sinn Fein. 

In Letterkenny once at a nightclub I remember four young English tourists were very disturbed with the menacing glares they were receiving when word quickly went around that there were English. Having come in just after them, we huddled them into a booth and told people they were our cousins, apologised and asked them whether they realised they were basically in the capital city of the IRA. Across the street stood a bar named for a nun who helped jailed IRA members. The local fast food chain worked as their money laundering operation. All the locals knew these things but it wouldn't be obvious to outsiders. They had been oblivious and soon left, shaken, for their hotel. Rural Ireland wasn't the twee place they had been led to believe, at least not for them after sunset.

I remember once working in a Grocery store when one of the night crew challenged a day-shift worker who happened to have an English accent. ""why are you coming over here, taking our jobs? You shouldn't be here!"". This guy might have had an English accent but if you can picture the most stereotypical Irish face, the one with ginger hair and freckles, that one belonged to him. You could take a fairly good guess that he had grown up in England but to Irish parents. You could see his body deflating.

So the people who make these sort of comments aren't the brightest I'm afraid and I'm truly embarrassed by them. All I can say is not everybody here is like them and hopefully you would find many more who would welcome you.

true,fool_on_the_hill,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"There are some things that could be confusing to newcomers. The branches of the Northern line are straightforward enough, but going further out on the Metropolitan or Central Lines can require greater care in picking the correct train (especially if you need to worry about fast &amp; semi-fast trains on the Metropolitan). Also, when lines share a platform (e.g. the 'Neapolitan' - Metropolitan, Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines) it's often not particularly obvious from looking at the board which line the next train will be on, if you're not familiar with the names of the destination stations.

The layout of the District line is also odd, since it's not possible to directly reach every District line station from every other District line station (you might have to change at Earl's Court), which IMO breaks the definition of a 'line'. Finally, the Circle line is no longer a circle (it's kind of a bent paperclip instead), which could be a massive gotcha for people who visit London occasionally and have out-of-date knowledge of the tube (although I think any routes that this change makes impossible were never sensible routes to take anyway).

That said, most newcomers are typically going from King's Cross to Oxford Circus or something, so have no excuse for getting confused. Even as a child, I remember liking the tube when I visited London. You just get a map, identify where your nearest stop is and where you need to go, and pick a reasonable looking route with few changes.

I think people get flustered because:

* The tube **is** complicated (it's absolutely huge), and if you're not good at ignoring irrelevant information (which not everyone does automatically) it can be overwhelming
* A lot of people find the atmosphere of the tube (crowds and confined spaces) stressful in itself, which makes concentrating on anything else much harder
* The penalty for making a mistake on the tube is extremely low, just a few wasted minutes getting a train back the way you came if you miss your stop. However, I think a lot of people don't realize this and worry about getting lost or overcharged or otherwise in trouble. The fact that experienced tube passengers are often very impatient &amp; unforgiving doesn't help.

true,DaveLambert,tardis,TARDIS,"Between Rose and Donna, it's clear that Donna had more character development.  But then, Donna had SO much farther to go!

When we met Rose, she had a very small world and kinda wanted more, but had no idea what, why or how.  She just drifted through life day by day (as many of us do), with work/family/boyfriend/entertainment and repeat.  By the end of her first episode, she had mustered up more bravery than her boyfriend did...she used a bit of talent she'd had since school (the gymnastics thingy with swinging on a chain) to save the Doctor and, in the process, saving the world (including her mum, who was in direct mortal danger at that very moment even tho Rose didn't entirely know it). Her BF (Mickey) cowered, and wanted to run away and leave the Doctor and humanity to whatever fate awaited them, as long as he was immediately safe, establishing him as a pretty pathetic character who Rose rightly abandoned a few minutes later in the story to go run off with the Doctor (boy, Mickey sure underwent as much character development as Donna later would!).

Rose's development was the same as the viewer's at first: to see the world, the universe, and the whole of time and space from the point of view that the Doctor had. To muster up that brief flash of courage and incorporate it into her daily life and routine, so she could REGULARLY fight battles and think her way through problems instead of just moving through life by rote. To learn to try new things and to be open to new experiences and to accept that there's more to life than being a cog in that great big machine we call society.  It's why, at the end of the first season/series, she was unhappy with the idea of going back to such a small existance, and why she could not adequately communicate this to her mum (Jackie) or her BF (Mickey).

By that end of the season she had developed her relationship with The Doctor enough to realize she had fallen for him a bit [(I mean, how could she not fall for him on the spot when he told the Daleks off the way he did, and say he'd come rescue her straight from the middle of the Dalek fleet)](/spoiler), which is why she was so tenacious about saving him and why she used every bit of her (limited) knowledge of the TARDIS to ""keep him safe"".  And why she also was so put off by his new appearance after the regeneration from 9 to 10. Did you ever see [this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZK8tPwA0Ro&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=78s), an extended version of the regeneration that aired in the UK as that year's Children In Need special? Americans - of which I'm one - usually aren't aware of it, since it was left off the DVDs! :(

In Series (season) 2, Rose has less character development because she's kinda already there...we mainly see her falling deeper and deeper for The Doctor, and getting smarter and smarter about how she handles threats (witness her attitude about how she dealt with Cybermen the second time she faced them, compared to the first).  In the meantime, we're seeing character development from Mickey (not to mention the return of Sarah Jane), which has an indirect effect on Rose.  By the final episode of her regular appearance, she's pretty much a hero for two universes...as is Mickey, for that matter!

TL; DR: the time Rose [gets stranded at Bad Wolf Bay](/spoiler) (for the first time), she really IS a pretty radically different person than the drab, ""everyman"" character we first met in Rose.",0,1312026289,null,0,false,0,c28ymta,t3_j3udd,t1_c28ymta,t1_c28yf3x,1427410906,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10

But whenever he's played at CB (which isn't a lot, for the first team at least), he's been quite nervous and his positioning and awareness hasn't been the best. I'm not saying he doesn't have the potential for that position, but maybe he's not the man to partner Carragher just yet. Also, if we're not getting a new LB, we may need Johnson at LB and thus Kelly at RB.

Kyrgiakos may have the experience and aerial presence, but as much as I like the guy, for the past 6 months he's committed a series of very costly mistakes, and I get the feeling that his confidence as well as whatever pace he had has left him. However, considering the aerial threat of Sunderland, I've a feeling that he might be the guy to start the first game. 

Similarly to Kelly, Wilson has been very nervous whenever he's played and with him I get the feeling that he'd hugely benefit from a season-long loan to a lower-level Premiership club where he can start week in week out and feel like a needed and useful player, a big fish in a small pond if you will, get some experience and most of all confidence in himself.

Agger is broken.

see, I've had the exact same problem. I normally always buy just the complete boxset at the end of the year, but this year I wasnt sure because of the gap between episodes.
So, I decided to buy the 6.1 DVD to keep me going until the series and complete dvd returns, and then buy the complete boxset anyway. 
But if you dont want to do this, then wait for the complete boxset. There are ALWAYS much more features/video diaries/audio commentaries on the complete, which is why I buy them. 
As for the 6.1 dvd, it only has the episodes, and two monster files. No audio commentaries or anything else.

I realize that the 1919 conflict was much more than simply a fight between two radically opposed forces (English and Irish), and I would assume that if that were the case, there would never have been a partitioning of Northern Ireland.

&gt;Thankfully, the days of Liverpool being reliant on Gerrard are over. Assuming Lucas &amp; Adam will be our first choice DMs, Meireles &amp; Aquilani can both fill in for Gerrard at AM. Shelvey &amp; maybe Henderson could also do a job. Doesn't the overcrowded midfield look like a great idea now?  
EDIT: The real worry is how this infection came about. Reading between the lines, Gerrard had an operation on his groin a few months ago which kept him out for the end of last season, now it turns out he has a groin infection. If he picked up the infection during surgery, it could be very, very hard to get rid of. Potentially career ending in fact. I hope to god he will simply be fit again in September, but having to sit out a month or two for antibiotic treatment is very worrying.

The circumstances are, for Gerrard's future, very worrying. I would not be surprised at all if this keeps him out for more than the next month or two &amp; continually reoccurs. Even if it just until September, that will make it a 6 month lay-off for Gerrard (he hasn't played since the United game in March) &amp; it will be a long time before he will fully recover, if, though I hate to be a pessimistic bastard, he ever does.

However, on the pitch, I'm confident we can get by. With Lucas &amp; Adam we're sorted at DM, Aquilani could be a very good AM, Meireles can provide box to box power &amp; the occasional screamer, and Henderson, Maxi &amp; Shelvey are all capable enough to fill in.

true,TossersUnite,uk,United Kingdom,"Thanks for the detailed response. Now, I broadly think along the same lines, but allow me to play devil's advocate for a second...

On trade, it seems reasonably balanced whether we are in or out. The external EU-wide tariff may perhaps hinder development in the future, considering the massive growth areas are the large emerging economies. If out of the EU, yes, we would suffer at the expense of those same barriers, but trade would be no means dry up. Norway and Switzerland are doing fine, for example. (The effect of the cash cows of finance, oil and fish are debatable). What's crystal clear however is that the economic case for integration is by no means certain. 

On the subject of peace, is this really the doing of the EU? The end of empire, the rise of democracy and the economic suicide of war make inter-power conflict surely unthinkable today? The UN could be argued to play the role of mediator now. 

It's not unthinkable that the EU could foster conflict in the future too. To quote Tony Benn: 'And, of course, what it is going to do – and this is what frightens me – it’s going to lead to nationalism because when you discover you that you elect a government but it can’t do what it wants to do, you know, people start saying, “It’s all the bloody French, it’s all the bloody Germans,” and it will into a sort of Yugoslav nationalism again.' [Source](http://www.thecommentfactory.com/an-interview-tony-benn-on-the-european-union-islamic-extremism-and-fidel-838/)

Of course economic union, as we're seeing the effects now, surely requires some level of economic parity. The talk of a 'two tier' Europe, split with the French and German titans on one hand and the Greek, Portuguese, etc on the other is very fitting. The Eurozone crisis is going to lead to Greece defaulting at the expense of German banks (thus pissing the Germans off) or the Greeks paying back their loans with ridiculous interest rates, thus further impoverishing them and enriching the Germans and widening the gap. 

So finally, where do we go? Is further integration really compatible with British statehood? It's becoming increasingly clear that permanent economic crisis can only be averted by stronger fiscal union in Euroland, leaving the UK something of an outsider.

The increasing power of the far right across Europe though- Le Penne in France, Wilders in the Netherlands, the EDL in the UK (not to mention the Eastern European neo-nazis) and many more makes me question the assertion too. Common themes are Islamophobia and- crucially- nationalism. The feeling that power is being whisked away by bureaucratic elites is a powerful tool of propaganda. 

On the HRA, that's Council of Europe, so no EU credit there. It is of course noteworthy the liberalising steps that must be taken to gain entry to the EU though, such as banning capital punishment. But is such direct influence on matters of justice really appropriate to assert over economically weaker countries (such as the Balkan states)?

So if the less rich nations of Europe begin to prosper and job opportunities open up in places like Poland, Ukraine etc. then we have to wait for permits too. The membership helps get round that. It also means people can just come here and take advantage of our social society too but I think they're in the minority. Most people want to work. Ever sat around unemployed? I find it maddening.

Tony Benn does make a very good point there but I think that'll only happen if we give the European parliament too much power, or if Britain switched over to the Euro and was treated as Greece was during an economic crisis. Correct me if I'm wrong but the whole idea of the EU and the Euro was a sort of ""together we stand"" policy and when the time came to help a member state out we all just kinda went - yep, you're on your own buddy!

I don't really know about the last point. Like I said I think it's a massive cultural thing. Britain has never played ball in Europe, not really. We were either the outsider under siege or the conqueror of the world enforcing our will on the continent as we pleased. We've never really had to play on equal terms before.

I think a lot of anti-EU sentiment spawns from a sense of entitlement amongst the British public who have this idea that we should run the roost and be given more control in Europe. The British are, and aren't European. We're the America of Europe - a mixture of the continent that came together under its own identity due to being isolated on an island.

To be frank, I don't want the French and Germans telling me what to do either, because let's face it they're the best of friends nowadays and don't really see us as European either.

The old attitudes are still there.

As for the conflict, clearly the Soviet Union had a lot to do with Western Europe refusing to war with each other in the past 70 years. The threat of 18,000 Soviet tanks pouring into Germany would do that to you. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

The UK iPlayer already works on many devices and platforms - iPads/Phones, Android, PS3, Wii, Virgin, the Web, other tablets and phones, etc. That's because the BBC has to provide it's services (which the iPlayer is) on as many things as possible.

Agreed absolutely and all of this is rightly so.


&gt;The Global iPlayer is completely different, and isn't bound by the public service remit of the BBC. It's aimed at people not in the UK, infact you can't get it in the UK. It's not a catch up like the UK version is, it's a completely different thing - more like Netflix. The approach to the whole thing will be different because of this.

This I don't buy. It's not *completely* different, it's incredibly similar. It has a different remit, sure, however it, crucially, unnecessarily caters for only a single vendor's product.

&gt;I don't understand how this is the case.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Liverpool is all gloss and no soul.

You have not grown up here. Talking about bars and the city centre touristy parts of town are not about what Liverpool is about. Think about Hillsborough and if you own a shop around here and I see the sun on sale, I'll be telling you you're in the wrong selling that in my city. My other people share my attitude of 'you'll never walk alone', or 'together as one'. 

lol, I'd meet you in the crack in town, a shitty pub with people actually smoking crack in the back of it. I'll talk to random rough and poor people, and ask them what our city is about. You'll be suprised to hear them talk, and share the same ideology as me, even giving some hint of wit to what they say. After that go to concert square and see normal lads who are either working as electricians or on the dole lol. They'll all tell you the same thing they ARE PROUD TO BE SCOUSE, proud of our accent, and proud of who we are as a people. 

We were capital of culture because it's just such a general idea. It seems to me you're walking around scared of really talking to people, so you're not getting the maximum benefits out of being in our city. Making statements on the internet such as 

&gt; Liverpool is all gloss and no soul.

Is fucking ridiculous. What is Londons culture? The most cultural people live in the highrise flats and say 'WAGWAN BLUD WER U FROM FAM', while posh wankers like you, then come to a different city like Liverpool and say it has no soul. lol, you're a muppet and if you don't like Liverpool then GET THE FUCK OUT. Gimp, I hope you actually say this shit to people in town who are scousers, and I hope they slap you to the floor and spit on you, you horrible maggot.

[Here](http://www.sidereel.com/Doctor_Who_%282005%29) is a link to the Sidereel page for the Doctor Who 2005-onwards episodes. If that link for whatever reason doesn't work, just go to sidereel.com, search for doctor who, and find the one that says 2005.

This page gives you the option to find online streaming links for every episode. Just click on the episode you want, click 'search links,' and it'll give you a menu of all the places it's available to view.

The two most trustworthy in my experience are megavideo and videobb. The only downside is that you can only watch around 72 minutes before the websites make you wait half an hour to watch more. However, if you watch one in megavideo and run out of time, there's almost always a videobb link to the next episode to watch while you wait.

My personal theory is a mod of the Valeyard theory (the dark/evil form of the Doctor that appears in between his 12th and 13th incarnation--possibly the Dream Lord).  I think that after everything and everyone the Doctor has lost, losing River (think of how tragic his last meeting with her will be) will push him over the edge (think ""the Time Lord Victorious"").  The Doctor (age 1103) decides to die to prevent himself from becoming evil and destructive.  This future, potential version of the Doctor is whom Kovarian, et al, is fighting.

They're a crossroads. Crossroads always clash.

As for Torchwood. Torchwood is a spinoff of Doctor who, and a lot of people like it... also a lot of people hate it. I would suggest trying it, I mean, you don't have anything to lose. Just keep in mind that it is a completely different kind of show from Doctor Who, really it is a lot like... Buffy or some such.

Lastly, if you need something else to watch I have some random Netflix suggestions (I know, you didn't ask for these, but I cant sleep so what the hell, might as well post them). Firefly, Star Trek, Star Trek Next Gen (season 1-2 of TNG are kind of bad, but if you get through them it gets better), Farscape, Dollhouse and BattleStar Galactica (Okay, really, watch BSG if you haven't all ready. No, I mean it. I am a die hard Doctor Who fan, but BSG is easily as good, if not better in some ways. Every one should watch BSG before they die.)",0,1312096844,null,0,false,0,c294atb,t3_j4omc,t1_c294atb,t3_j4omc,1427413650,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

But how solid are the numbers for the economic benefits? Inevitably they will not meet projections, and inevitably a project of this scale will run over-budget. So how much slack is there before the cost no longer equals the benefits? And how does this plan tie into the wider scheme for re-generating the Midlands (assuming there is one)?

There are other things we could be investing this in; improvements to the rest of our ageing train network for example, or even rolling out a next-generation broadband network to allow more companies to video-conference rather then travel.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The one thing I struggle to get people to come up with is a genuine positive of the EU that the UK couldn't achieved for less, to a greater extent, and with more accountability, outside the EU.

Every single positive listed so far in this thread.  Cheaper, better, freer.

- *Most the trade comes from the EU?*  Same can be said for Norway and Switzerland - you don't need to be a member of the EU to be a member of the EEA.

-  Freedom of travel?  Could be agreed outside of the EU and, besides, some people seem to think we'd need to apply for visas if it weren't for the EU.

- *Human rights?*  The ECHR is not part of the EU, and there's still nothing to say the UK couldn't codify its own constitution.

-  *Democracy/not the House of Lords?!* Add up all the people in the EU and divide by the number of MEPs.  Now do the same for the UK and MPs.  The EU is incredibly less representative, and they too have their 100% appointed Commission, only they're responsible for drafting all legislation.

- *Peace in Western Europe?*  Probably the laziest of the positives people give.  Low cost airlines, mobile phones and the Internet all say that if in a parallel world the EU would cease to exist tomorrow the UK would not be going to war with either France, Spain, Germany, Holland or Italy.  Simply. Wouldn't.  Happen.  People being able to talk to and visit one another, that's what stops wars.  It's hard to sell a war when we're all chatting amongst ourselves down tubes and in the ether.

- *There's a trickle down effect to the poorer countries with foreign wages?*  You can arrange as much or as little trickle as you want outside of the EU.  Having said that, those that have experienced this trickle have also experienced a brain drain and they're now finding out that the trickle is more akin to a drug pusher handing out free samples to get you hooked. 

-  *Sum greater than its parts?*   Problem being the sum is not duty bound to represent or act in the best interest of any one composite part.  It's a bit like a poor American voting Republican.  There's this argument that its making something stronger, wealthier, more powerful.  Only thing is, it's not them.  It's never them.  In fact, it actually serves to make them weaker.  In the political sense of having more clout on the World Stage the EUs torn anyway and what's more, outside the EU the UK is excellently placed with the Commonwealth.

Having said that I'm not really anti-EU, I'm just don't think the UK should be a part of it.  I'm still to find one solid thing for what the EU provides the UK which it couldn't get better, cheaper or more accountable outside, not one, and it's a lot of money when there isn't even one USP.",0,1312119090,null,0,true,0,c29595u,t3_j3r8z,t1_c29595u,t3_j3r8z,1427414100,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The new journey only saves 25 minutes, and you'll still have to get through Birmingham traffic when you disembark.  Damn, you still have to drive into Brum in the morning, or catch another train.   You still have to stand on the platform.  You still have to travel to Birmingham even if it could be 25 minutes quicker than the old Birmingham train. Plus, in addition to dreading what a seasonal commute ticket is going to cost, you'd be dependent on one form of transport.  Good luck doing a Birmingham-London commute in the car if the trains break down/go on strike.  Home counties not so bad; B'ham....*hell* springs to mind.

Or maybe it's that businesses will relocate from London because the train is 25 minutes quicker and now only takes an hour.  Might be cheap enough for clients to visit if they book in advance and travel off peak, it's still going to take them at least a couple of hours start to finish though.  Of course if they don't travel off peak or if they haven't been able to book in advance the car is much, much cheaper and arguably it might even get you there quicker.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;**All it took me is someone pointing out that Birmingham isnt in the home counties and therefore is ineligable to have investment or a future.** 

I didn't say that, I said a factory or industry might attract business, but not a slightly faster train.

&gt;**The derision positively drips off you,**

I was very careful to aim the derision solely at Birmingham.  I don't particularly like Liverpool either but there's nothing wrong with Liverpool as such, it's just a matter of personal taste.  Some cities just have a feel and it's up to personal preference, but that doesn't apply to Birmingham.  It doesn't have a feel, it has a condition.  It's the schizophrenic city of the UK.  It's a fractured society, a city which has been left behind with real  social tensions manifesting. Does it need investment.  Yes.  Has it had massive investment recently?  Yes.  The NEC, the Bullring, the canals, the cube.  Has it helped?  Yes, but the problem persists.

By rights B'ham with its central location should be the hub of England outside Londion.  In reality Manchester and Leeds have outstripped it.  Birmingham needs help but a train isn't going to be a panacea.  It's like a doctor telling someone they have cancer and then trying to cheer them up with a lollipop.

&gt;**We can either invest outside of the home counties** 

Nobody is complaining about that, if and when the money makes itself available.

&gt;**or we can continue to invest in the south to the exclusion of all else.**

Well Birmingham has had massive investment recently.  There's a huge extension programme going ahead with the M6.  Manchester's had a lot of investment and  Leeds is quickly becoming a recognised alternative to London.  Nobody commutes to London from the North because culturally it stands on its own, the major cities have their own identities.  What identity is Birmingham trying to sell, that it's now a little bit closer to London and only a two hour commute?  Because that's realistically how long it's going to take even with a fast train - at least!  

&gt;**Oh, and this rail line effectively makes BHX equidistant from central london as LHR, and quite a few people already live in Birmingham and commute to london via the existing train lines, probably cant see it from your high horse of course.)**

GOOD LUCK TRYING TO SELL THAT NARRATIVE!  That because London Heathrow into the City takes about as long on the Underground as Birmingham will take on a fast train they're equidistant.  You've still got to manage the Underground when you get off your Birmingham train.  You've still got to manage a prior train journey to get you to Birmingham to catch your London train in the first place.  You've still got to factor in time making sure you arrive early for the train.  

The idea of anybody saying that this in some way makes it as though Birmingham is only as far from London as Heathrow smacks of desperation.

&gt;**quite a few people already live in Birmingham and commute to london via the existing train lines, probably cant see it from your high horse of course.**

How many miserable souls need to be saved 25 minutes to justify £32 billion?  Some people might make it as a temporary solution to a temporary problem but that in itself is an argument as to why it shouldn't be spent on Birmingham.  It's a major city that doesn't hold its own.  People still go out of it to work.  Cities generally work the other way around; it's what they do.  One slightly warmer train and we''re expected it'll suddenly find its entrepreneurial flourish.  £32 billion - give it to something else if we have it to invest.

That's the point, nobody can.  They've also said they'll compensate houses which lose value because of the new line.  Nobody can put a figure on that either because nobody knows how it would be calculated or what's going to happen to the market.  I know it to be self evident that a lot of people will try to claim it.  £32 billion is starting to look more and more like a low ball.

So we've got a £32billion project to save 23 minutes off a Birmingham to London trip and about 45 minutes off a Manchester to London trip.  

If it was your £32billion to invest is this how you'd spend it?  Because I suspect it'd be better spent on research and manufacturing plants, maybe with a little kick back towards maintaining the current rail network properly until we have [mass produced zero emission fuel in the next ten to twenty years capable of flight.](http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/concordes-successor-revealed-at-paris-air-show-2300191.html)  Or is it that what it's spent on isn't really relevant and that it's more like a spoiled sibling complaining London got a present and now it's their turn?

I just think £32billion on a train set which saves B'ham 23 minutes, or means Mancunians visiting London can stay in bed 45 minutes longer isn't the most prudent investment.

&gt;When it comes to infrastructure projects it appears that anything goes in London whereas anywhere else has to justify themselves to the end of the Earth.

London has to justify itself just as much as anywhere else.  It's just that London, being the capital, finds it somewhat easier sometimes to justify certain projects.  Birmingham-Manchester didn't have any problems justifying the £3billion M6 lane extension.  Manchester even came 3rd in the world for the 2000 Olympic Games bid.

Manchester and Leeds don't do that, nor do Newcastle, Bristol, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Cardiff.  I'm the one saying Birmingham must address the real problems first.

There have been some arrests of anonymous ringleaders / irc admins which the media have managed to get a little confused about (and given the relationship between the two you cant really blame them). You should expect the anonymous arrests to continue for a long time yet, they have thousands of suspects to process and this will take time.
