true,Atman00,null,null,"I think you may be conflating a few different ideas.  There are certain events that cannot be changed, and then there are time locks, then there's the idea that a time traveler can't get involved in his own time stream.  All of these are separate concepts.  

We'll start with time locks.  The only time the show has ever mentioned time locks is in reference to the Time War, which was time locked by The Doctor.  It was something The Doctor intentionally *did* to the event, not something inherent in the event itself.  A Time Lock doesn't just mean the event can't be changed, it means nobody can ever visit the event, or leave it.  That's why we never see Time Lords (except in very special circumstances), and why The Doctor can't just hop on over to Gallifrey before the Time War.  It's all time locked, completely cut off from the rest of the universe.  

Fixed points in time are the events that can't be changed.  They have to happen the way.  Waters of Mars is a good example of this.  The Doctor repeatedly refers to it as a fixed event that can't be changed, and he's really depressed because he knows he has to let these people die.  It was a fixed point even though this was his first trip to this event, so it has nothing to do with him crossing his own timeline.  (Of course, he *does* change it, breaking one of the laws of the universe in the process.)  The show never makes it clear why there are fixed points.  It's just one way (out of many) for writers to explain why the Doctor isn't able to help a given situation.

Then there's the idea you can't go back on your own personal timeline.  This is a way for writers to explain why the Doctor can't just try again and again whenever he gets something wrong.  Rose's father is a good example of what happens when you interact with your own timeline, but the end of season 5 is not.  The Doctor crossing his own timeline has nothing to do with the cracks in the universe from season 5.  Those cracks only existed because the TARDIS exploded.  The reason The Doctor was able to interact with his own timeline in that instance was because the universe had already blown up.  In other words, the Doctor interacting with his own timeline was an *effect* of the cracks of the universe, not a *cause* of it.",0,1306462162,null,0,false,0,c1w98ka,t3_hk44h,t1_c1w98ka,t1_c1w5g6f,1427185312,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

(IE, the one that allows the series to continue past that point in the Eleventh Doctor's timeline; to the twelfth doctor, etc)

There are a few reasons I like this idea.
-It could be an explanation for how the doctor circumvents the 12 regeneration limit (Moffat said there'd be something about that, and I really don't like the lame retcon in that one Sarah Jane episode) I'd say it's feasible the ganger doctor's regeneration number is reset since he's a newly created doppelganger.

-The ganger doctor would be epic for time travel plot device since he's NOT the doctor technically, so he can interact with past versions of himself without fear of destroying the universe. (Up to the future version of the eleventh that dies, because after that any future regeneration of the doctor WOULD be the ganger doctor)
-Because of this last point, the TARDIS's conspicuous absence can be explained--the Doctor and the Ganger Doctor are working together to manipulate the timeline. I've always believed that the Doctor's invitation from the season opener contained more than the others' did and he knows more than he lets on. If he does know he's going to die, perhaps he gets the ganger doctor to help manipulate things. (IE, take the TARDIS, you're the new 'real' doctor now)

You *don't* add a line showing tax on invoices you send to clients. (Unless you're VAT registered, and unless you're going to be making a shitting fortune in your first year, you shouldn't be). Your invoices shouldn't say anything about tax or VAT, unless it's a note somewhere saying ""I am not VAT registered).

As a self-employed person (= sole trader, this is not a fishmonger), you will pay Income Tax and National Insurance. Don't bother reading up on VAT or corporation tax, they don't apply to you. You complete a self-assessment form to find out the amount of Income tax you have to pay (or you can get someone to do it for you). Apart from putting some of your income aside to *pay* the tax, I'd suggest you don't worry about it right now. Just get up and running &amp; get some money coming in. But don't leave it too late, check the deadlines.

For what it's worth, everything is MUCH MUCH easier if you think of your ""working"" self as a ""business"" - which is what it is - and separate it from your ""personal"" income and expenditure.

Legally, you don't actually have to have a separate bank account for the business if you're self employed. But for practical reasons, I'd strongly recommend it, right from the beginning. You'll find most banks charge for business accounts, but if you don't need a business credit facility, just open another current account (free) and use that. Or go to Abbey, who I believe still do free business accounts.

You'll be paying all your Income Tax in one or two payments, so put some money aside.

*The Green Wing* - Two series and a special of Anarchy, Lechery and downright oddity in a Hospital. Very little hospitalling actually occurs.

*QI* - Eight series of a Panel show hosted by Stephen Fry with a selection of (generally) comedians discussing things that are ""Quite Interesting"".

*Jonathan Creek* - Several series and specials of Paranormal Investigation. Really well written detective series. Produced by Verity Newman (Who's first producer), The guy that played Nixon in S6E1&amp;2 is in it quite a bit, and Paul McGann was in the latest special.

Your wording makes it sound like it was voluntary, it certainly was not.

In fact they didn't anyway, preferring instead to drop the case. Which is precisely the reason why the head of the CPS came out and advised those already prosecuted to appeal. Why? The implication is there was a [lack of disclosure](http://www.innocent.org.uk/misc/disclosure.html) to the defence (contrary to the CPIA), which would mean those convicted did not receive a fair trial.

But where lies my home?

My grass isn't green, 
My sky isn't blue, 
The river runs dry, 
My flower has died, 
This isn't my home.

I follow the moon, 
To find a path away from the scorching sun, 
I follow the stars to my abode, 
It's burning, 
I seize the moment to hear a story no one's telling any more, 
The worlds forgotten, the words forbidden.

I can certainly see why you think it wouldn't be the best move to sell Johnson to increase the summer spending budget for positions we definitely need like on the wings, left-back, CB, and elsewhere. but when you see two young RB's completely capable of playing there at the top level you have to wonder how it's going to work with three of them. Since FSG, Comolli and Kenny all basically agree that it's best to invest in younger talent, why not free up some payroll and spending cash to buy a nice young LB or Winger etc. 

All I'm saying is that Johnson is a a great player but certainly Kelly and Flanagan should be given a shot at RB once Liverpool signs a decent LB. My point is that Liverpool have 3 serviceable RB's now in Johnson, Kell, and Flanagan and we don't need all three and it would be in the clubs best interest and in good business to sell.

Maybe if they got a revamp, similar to Silurian/Dalek/Cybermen.

If they did revamp, cold, chilling, and deathly aspects would need to be greatly emphasized. I can envision a beefier ""Mr. Freeze"" version of the Terminator for instance.

The main thing working against them is lack of connect with modern concepts and pre-occupations (Daleks/Cybermen - technology taking over every day life, Silurians/Sontarans - genetic modification/supremacy, Autons - plastic is in *everything*, etc.)

All the Ice Warriors had going for them was the noble warrior with a touch of the inhuman and unstoppable.

First episode I watched was S2 E12.

I hated the show at first, I thought it was stupid and didn't want to watch it, but the guys in the house watched it, and I started to like it in secret.

I never admitted to them that I liked the show, and then things went horrible and I've never seen them since.

But I obsess over it now. Openly.

&gt; Whilst there is evidence that Jody McIntyre was inadvertently struck with a police baton the investigation found that the actions of officers were justifiable.

So he was assaulted then, and the MET are not going to take it further. And there is no reference to Mcintyre being violent. Also note that this report was not actually independent. The case of Jody is not really what 'pisses me off', but the wider context of political policing along with their monopoly on violence.

&gt; 10) Zoe Heriot (played by Wendy Padbury, 1968-9). Something of a human computer who stowed away in the TARDIS, Zoe had a neat line in exasperation at the Second Doctor's frequent mishaps, and was played with great charm by Wendy Padbury, who had to don some interesting costumes whilst in the role (writes Gavin Fuller).

&gt; 9) Nyssa (played by Sarah Sutton, 1981-3). A perfect foil for the Fifth Doctor, this aristocratic Trakenite was a gentle, sensitive soul who had to endure the Master stealing the body of her father, yet nonetheless was capable of moments of bravery.

&gt; 8) Jo Grant (played by Katy Manning, 1971-3). Another perfect foil, this time for the mother hennish tendencies of the Third Doctor, clumsy UNIT operative Jo was insanely loyal to the Doctor, who had to cope with her well-meaning tendencies which didn't almost go to plan. One of the warmest Doctor-companion pairings of the original series, as clearly seen in her leaving scene.

&gt; 7) Ace (played by Sophie Aldred, 1988-9). A streetwise tomboy with a passion of pyrotechnics, Ace was arguably the first time a companion was given an emotional journey as the series developed, prefiguring the Russell T Davies era in that respect, as the Doctor forced her to confront her phobias and neuroses. Sophie Aldred managed to give what could have been a very annoying companion a likeability which made Ace another good foil for the Doctor.

&gt; 6) Barbara Wright (played by Jacqueline Hill, 1963-5). Not standard companion material, being a thirtysomething history teacher, the idea being that she could interpret the historical adventures in the days when the programme was supposed to be partly educational, and definitely the only companion who helped save the universe in sensible sweater and shoes. Barbara had a remarkably varied in-depth range of historical knowledge for a secondary school history teacher, but was an integral part of establishing the series in its earliest years.

&gt; 5) Donna Noble (played by Catherine Tate, 2008). Donna surmounted her all-too evident limitations, as shown in The Runaway Bride, and matured from self-absorbed irritant to a mature woman who was able to show great compassion and keep the Tenth Doctor in much-needed check at times during her sojourn in the TARDIS. Catherine Tate gave a fine performance of some depth as Donna, and it was generally tragic for the character that her memory of that time had to be wiped.

&gt; 4) Peri Brown (played by Nicola Bryant, 1984-6). A purely personal choice, as the character of American student Peri Brown was no great shakes, but perhaps as I was at an impressionable age at the time, the companion I found, and still find come to that, the most physically attractive of all who have travelled in the TARDIS. Given the number of baddies who lusted after Peri I wasn't the only one!

&gt; 3) Leela (played by Louise Jameson, 1977-8). A savage huntress, the idea was that this companion, who relied on instinct and had received little or no education, could act as something of an Eliza Doolittle figure to the Doctor. Most comfortable clad in somewhat revealing animal skins, a lot of Leela's success was due to Louise Jameson?s fine performance in the role.

&gt; 2) Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper 2005-6, 2008). When I first heard of this casting I must admit my first thought was ""Oh no what are they doing?"" - but Billie Piper won me over quickly with a very fine, naturalistic performance as the companion who heals the Doctor after the traumas of the Time War. One of the companions who comes across best as a character in her own right rather than something of a cipher, as all too often happened in the past.

&gt; 1) Sarah Jane Smith (played by Elisabeth Sladen 1973-6, 2006, 2008). Who else? The fact that alone of all the companions she has returned to the recent series and been in two spin-offs shows the hold Sarah has on popular memory. An intrepid journalist, this was someone who clearly voyaged with the Doctor out of choice and who displayed great determination and bravery in the face of the all manner of horrors she encountered whilst on the TARDIS. The way in which Elisabeth Sladen - who died in April, 2011 - inhabited the role also played its part in making Sarah the best of companions to the Doctor.

I knew about Doctor Who before they started making new ones, because I'd seen a few references to it in regards to Douglas Adams. I figured if he'd had a hand in a few episodes, it must be worth watching.

true,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,"(disclaimer: I used to work for the UK's 2nd biggest ISP doing customer support, i know more than i really ever wanted to about ADSL)

it's nothing to do with Talk talk - the same will happen with any provider of ADSL.

you are on ADSL - which means your internet is highly dependant on your phoneline, which if you have only 2MBs, then is at a pretty far distance (i'd guess 6km from the exchange?), and you may just be too far out to get reliable ADSL. If its also fairly old, the line may just not be good enough.

You can try some things like

- checking there are no power sources near to the phoneline that may be interfering
- replacing the filter
- using a better modem (generally the ones that come free are pretty awful. A decent netgear/linksys is more likely to be able to hold a stable connection).
- check the [test socket](http://www.skyuser.co.uk/forum/view-master.html) . If it works fine in here, then there is a problem with the wiring/phones/something else in your house that is causing it.
-it's possible (though very unlikely) that there's a fault on your line/at the phone exchange. You need to go via talktalk support to have this investigated. HOWEVER, i would do this only as a last resort - its possible the checks that BT run at this point will say ADSL cannot be done on the line and will end your service.

however I suspect the problem is simply that you are too far away to get decent ADSL, and from where you said

&gt; We wanted BE internet but are not in a 'good area' so unfortunately cannot get it.

That sounds to me like BE refused to provision it (or BT did) due to line quality, so it's possible that talktalk have given you it on a phoneline that really isn't capable of getting it.

I find it odd that it has worked absolutely fine until yesterday. Over a week of internet but sometimes it could drop really slow, but that is understandable.

The BT man fitted a new 'bell filter' if I remember rightly? Into the main phone line.

We also have been running a netgear dg834g and the talk talk router and have the same problem. Thing is, at the moment... It seems it works ok when my Mac is connected wirelessly, but cuts out when the xbox's are connected through ethernet. (It was cutting out with just one yesterday)

We have had both xbox's working on it. (Even with it upstairs on a rubbish phone line extension which we read up was a bad idea so brought it downstairs.

To me this doesn't fall short of police tactics of the very same type of protests. Wind the young impressionable students up and get great photos, of a minority, of chaotic disobedient thugs. In the same sense it worked, however the police hadn't thought of people like Jody McIntyre being there and everyone taking mobile phone footage of the incident.

My final point would be that you and I don't sympathise with Mr McIntyre but there are a whole heap of students/non-students now who do.

My kids were overjoyed! They were most excited about K-9, as they are Old School Whovians and in a perfect twist, the Adipose episode was on television so they could find out who the cute little chubby dude was! Thanks Nogbog, you are a Timelord victorious!

Of course she was not at all happy when my mum chased her with a remote control Dalek, or when a life sized one started talking to her at a museum. 

When she got a bit more articulate she explained that it was because when Daleks exterminate people they go away and she didn't want Daddy to go away. She's 6 now and old enough to know it's not real, but she still gets visibly uncomfortable during any Dalek episode.

I never knew why people find Daleks so scary. They're slow, lumbering pepperpots with a plunger for an arm. My mum's generation used to hide behind the sofa when they came on. Thanks to my daughter I now realise that for many people they introduced the concept of sudden death. The fact that someone you love might be taken from you at any moment is a shocking idea for a young mind. That's what a Dalek represents.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's really quite simple - RTD re-wrote perfectly good origin stories for major characters (The Cybermen for example), and surrounded the Doctor with utterly *crap* characters that would not have looked out of place in *Eastenders*, and in fact if you tuned in at the right point you might have had difficulty telling the difference.

The Doctor: Can go anywhere in time and space but repeatedly ends up on a London council estate surrounded by morons who consistently refer to him as 'oi! Doktah!' and the audience is treated like idiots.  

Then we have the whole gay agenda thing, ruining another show with potential entirely in the process.  If RTD had remained in control I would not have been surprised had the Doctor regenerated into Julian Clary, painted the TARDIS pink and renamed the show to *Gaydar Who* where he travels throughout time pointing out gay people.  See him?  Gay.  Einstein?  Gay.  Hitler?  Gay.

And the Doctor having a daughter?  Please.

Oh and lets not forget the utterly stupid plots like the one where the Daleks want to destroy the entire universe.  Somebody didn't do the maths on that one.

RTD clearly had no clue or respect for established canon and focused too much on the insignificant details of minor bit part characters (old couple on bus going on about 'chops for tea' for example.)

I thought Tennant was great but often he was denied the opportunity to truly shine by being confined to working within what was essentially a sit com.


EDIT - I almost forgot!  THE DOCTOR DONNA!  Possibly the most stupid thing I have *ever* seen **EVER**.

if you don't have a test socket, then your wiring/lines are VERY old - i believe BT started installing them in late 70s - so that's definitely part of the problem.

mm, if it worked fine till yesterday, it could well be an exchange problem - bug talktalk a LOT, and they eventually will be forced to be report it to BT as a fault. Bt will then check the exchange for issues. It sounds like sudden interference or just overload/exchange fault if its suddenly changed to doing this.

the LLU info is useful - what that means is rather than BT's equipment in the phone exchange, it is talktalk's, so it might be that using any of BT/Orange/Sky/Easynet give you a better connection, but it's hard to guarantee that.

You could be right - I certainly heard nothing but silence from him and his party while Blair/Brown inhabited Downing Street. Obviously, as a former minister, he will have used the services of Downing Street on occasion. 

Would this be the Mr. Watson MP who trousered over £100k of our money on his London flat including furnishing it out etc (he wanted to ""use up the entire budget"" according to the Telegraph)?

And the Mr. Watson MP who spent the full Commons food allowance too? One only has to look at his triple chin and expanded waistline to find out where it all went. (I find it quite hilarious how the authorities had to question why a M&amp;S pizza wheel was on this expenses)

Just think of how many nurses his wastage and glutton could pay for - since that's the standard measurement under today's Labour Party (full of hypocrisy) and one he used to question the spending.

Some of the flesh story was genuinely terrifying. Melting people, walls on eyes, Jennifer. I loved the 'The Thing' vibes I got from this episode. From the time  the Doctor repeated the line breath, and the lady with the eyepatch appeared out of the wall again and the doctor was nonchalant about it... I was beyond terrified though. The end...I'm in shock right now. It's going to be a long week.

The Eyepatch lady is fucking terrifying. From the previews...oh god the previews hurt my head right now. It's probably worth noting the similarities between the Silence whispering, 'sleep, sleeeep,' and EPL whispering 'Pusshh.'

It'd be nice if after the next season was a continuing story arc. 

The first part of the season is beginning to make sense though. Amy's Child, the Impossible Astronaut in the first episode is supposed to be a weapon of some sort. She will bring about the silence or something. 

And I was going what since the Tom Baker line at the beginning.

I have even more speculation. This may not make sense though. Near the ending the Doctor said his memory may survive. I took that to extend to the other flesh beings, including Jennifer. I think Jennifer may eventually evolve into the Nightmare Child mentioned in the End of Time.

2) The silent were either just charged with catching and keeping the born child safe, OR are the really masterminds behind everything and are using others

3) Future Doctor knows all of this already and needed to go back in time and kill himself to get everyone on this mission, but we dont know who kills him and how he's coming back to life or changing his fate

No plot elements were leaked, of course, it's mainly just poor timing and, IMHO, spoiling the surprise that Moffat seems so adamant that he wants us viewers to have.  So, then, why would they ever want to tip off the viewer to the upcoming story, especially if Moffat seems upset that viewers are trying to find out what happens in upcoming episodes?  Don't you see the obvious contradiction here?

I don't argue that this is a major spoiler, and haven't said anything to indicate that.  Rather, I think it's just silly and stupid timing for the BBC to deflate the surprise that Moffat clearly wants.  It makes the BBC look terribly uncoordinated and, frankly, like they don't much care about keeping up with the desires of Doctor Who's producers.  Or perhaps Moffat is just being inconsistent?

true,smileyman,smith,Smith,"&gt;No plot elements were leaked, of course, it's mainly just poor timing and, IMHO, spoiling the surprise that Moffat seems so adamant that he wants us viewers to have. So, then, why would they ever want to tip off the viewer to the upcoming story, especially if Moffat seems upset that viewers are trying to find out what happens in upcoming episodes? Don't you see the obvious contradiction here?

No I don't, because Moffat wasn't pissed off at people talking about things that were appearing in future episodes, he was specifically pissed off that people were invited to the special showings of episodes 1 &amp; 2 and then revealed extremely specific plot details and endings before the episodes even aired. That's what he was complaining about, not general bits of knowledge being leaked. 

Going back to the beginning of this season, there's a huge difference between saying that Rory will be wearing a Roman uniform at some point in the future, and that Amy [is a Ganger](/spoiler).

Hell, Moffat himself promoted the first two episodes by saying that one of the major characters in Doctor Who would be dying in the first episode, which is far more of a spoiler than is a picture of a fat blue guy whom we've seen before.

Here a translation of 5 of his posts from hundred:

* in end of time the doctor says  ""I'm a girl! No! No... I'm not a girl. And still not ginger! And something else, something important, I'm, I'm..."" but can't finish the sentence. It might that he can now procreate (spell of Pythia/Sisterhood of Karn broken)
* first minutes eleven hour: two different door steps of the tardis appear and disappear. Later in flesh and stone [or another episode]:  a clock jumps from 12am to 12pm, a lost half day, where Amy sleeps with the doctor? In any case, there are definitely two different universes/time lines, with two different Amys (one pregnant, one not)
* River Song kills the doctor when she is a child, the child in the space suit; when she shoot, she says ""of course not"", because she remembers not being hit
* River is the daughte of Amy (and the doctor from that lost 12h) in one of the time lines but not in the other (or Moffat hints on that to keep us confused)
* Time of Angels: River injects Amy something, it may have caused the pregnancy or create a perception filter to hide it
* there are important shadows: behind the sarcophag in big bang, and again behind the car in impossible astronaut
* in a good man goes to war, the war might be about the child amy gets while being captured in the 51 century
before wife:
* idris is probably Romana and lives in the E-space
before almost.people:
* the doctor wanted to come to this place to examine the flesh and made the copy voluntary, very important for the story arc
* the doctor causes the problems and most of the people will die
* flesh has nothing to do with nestene or sontarans
* flesh may copy the tardis, or the ganger doctor disappears with the flesh or founds the order of clerics  or all die
after:
* flesh and probably the clone doctor survived (on molecular level)
* which may lead to time traveling flesh
* the silences are flesh, possible also river song and amy's parents
* twin babies in good man goes to war

The ""reasoning"" behind having the locks in place, was so that no matter what intrusion, there would still be a technician monitoring and controlling the power to the gate. One in-one out, 24 hour shifts. I suppose this was either safety or assurance.

RIDICULOUS THEORY TIME:
Maybe the Silence are actually a good race - they traveled back in time using their faux-Tardis to tell Amy to tell the doctor that she's pregnant. They protected the little girl, allowing her to grow up. They allowed themselves to be destroyed so that the timeline would be safe.
Also, maybe that didn't even happen. Maybe that single silence in TIA's beginning was one of thousands, millions.

Although, none of this is relevant until the next episode, so :V
Also, when Amy's transmitter is taken from her - maybe the things she said through it were from being in the outer-space hospital (I'd need to re-watch it)

the US wont get this episode for another week due to bbcamericas douchebaggery, so if you arent going to torrent/download it before then, you should just avoid the entire subreddit until next week. otherwise things are gonna be spoiled for you, as not everyone can walk on eggshells for everyone else. not everyone is current with the series, but you dont see spoiler tags on everything related to seasons 5 and 6 or whatever. so relax, and go download the episode from thejosh and be happy.

ALSO when you clicked the link and saw it wasnt a pic/vid whatever, and was text, you should have immediatly stopped reading. no one forces you to read. you would have had to go down three comments to get to the first spoilery comment in this thread, but you kept reading. its not really their fault, in this case.

ALSO lowkee posted no spoilers in this link. 'whaaaaaaaaat' and 'see title' are not spoilery in any way shape or form. you have no right to be upset with him, you should be upset with (and reply to) each individual that posted a spoiler in a thread that was not marked for spoilers.

ALSO no one made you click the link to this thread to begin with. it clearly shows its from doctorwho sub, and you knew you hadnt seen the episode yet when others had.

It surprised me, too.

As in, he wasn't so much picking the Doctor over Amy as he was picking the Doctor over *himself*. And that he trusted the Doctor's ability to help Amy more than Amy's ability to help herself. I think at that moment, he probably figured that Amy's best bet was the Doctor, regardless of either of their feelings about it.

And did Amy wish the Doctor back into existence via her Ganger while laid up in her prenatal prison?

And actually that train of thought opens up a whole other aspect of Amy being a Ganger that I hadn't realized - her more advanced ganger can be controlled across time as well as space. Amy's real body is in one place at some point in time while her Ganger hops all over time and space. That's been happening for at least a few episodes.

true,rhakai,null,null,"Something that keeps bothering me (In a good way) is the fact that there's still evidence of time travel in this episode, everything else aside--

First, the doctor mentions that he never thought he would say that again about the cockerel in rebel flesh. He also knows a good deal more about the flesh than anyone else. I'm torn between thinking this is just him having figured out what's going on with Amy and investigating and the idea that there's something timey-wimey involved. It seems a little odd that he would know about this early Flesh incident just on his own, and I think it's a bit odd he'd know about the Flesh offhand, too--we've never heard of it before.

Second, there's that bit with the phone in Almost People; when the real doctor is with the gangers pretending to be the ganger doctor, he makes a phone ringing sound just before the phone rings. I get that he made the original phone call to the little kid, but A) how does he know that this will necessary to save everyone trapped in the acid well room later and B) how does he know when the kid will call back--he's pretty spot on about the timing, too.

Finally, the doctor knows all about eyepatch lady, which seems really bizarre. I buy that he's able to figure out what's up with the pregnancy, especially if he knows about the flesh from beforehand, but how does he know about the lady telling Amy to push? That seems way too specific for him to have figured out on his own.

So, to conclude--there's some sort've time manipulation going on here. I'd say the Doctor's playing the long game--this is either somehow a future Doctor (Maybe he lied about his age in TIA?) or it has something to do with the future Doctor not having a TARDIS, or more simply, his invitation included more information than everyone else's and he's been able to do a little research based on what he told himself. (I think this is perhaps a little less likely by itself because it doesn't explain the doctor's comment about never getting to say that again, but it could be paired with something?)

Motivations: Why does everyone keep changing their minds? First they want to 'just live in peace' then it's 'we must kill EVERYONE!' This flips about 20 times, or about as many times as is necissary to pad out the two parter.

It's us or them!: Yes we get it! How many times do they say this??

Amy and Rory: Seemed a bit 'off' this past couple of weeks. Rory wasn't in his usual 'save amy' mode and seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time going after soppy girl. 

Acid mines: You do what now? Why? No one ever really seemed to get into why this mine was even here - who the hell needs acid? Why? Does it matter? Who knows.

Nothing mattered: Yes, we got the cool reveal about Amy, but nothin in the episode really came of anything. Quick, we need to run to this place! Now here! Now let's run here!

Neat and tidy: ""The Tardis has made you human now!"" Oh... ok.... ""This vial of stuff will stop your aneurism exploding!"" Oh... ok...  Handy that those peeps had to hang back and save everyone. Wouldn't want any duplicates hanging around.

Talking of duplicates: What's up with the gangers? First they are non-sentient avatar things, next episode there's dozens of sentient waste products piled up 'suffering'. 

The Tardis has made you human!: All except Amy. Because she was connected to the ganger. But aren't these things human? Don't they suffer? Wait, doctor, if you zap the Amy ganger, won't she 'die'? Oh... just go ahead then...

There are 2 sonics, the original and the one made of flesh when the flesh doctor was made. The FD had both the original and flesh sonic when he threw the real sonic at the OD (19:35). Meaning at this point they both have one. The reason the FD had both was to convince the rest of the people that they should trust the OD (which they think he is flesh) as he had the only method to track the missing girl.

At 39:00 it is really just to have a cool shot of the OD throwing a sonic at the FD (As the Doctor disintegrate so does the sonic, so odds are it was also made of flesh). As for continuity, I would just think that the FD gave his flesh sonic to the OD to... calibrate it to... destabilize the flesh. I don't know, I think it was made just for a cool scene.

As for plot, this has absolutely no relevance here.

2.) Blink. This is absolutely wonderful because it's almost the exact opposite of Girl in the Fireplace. In this one it's the Doctor needing rescue, and it's the normal humans doing the rescuing. In fact the Doctor is hardly in it at all, but it's got some of the best character writing in all of the new series. Plus it's got incredibly creepy and scary monsters.

3.) The Doctor's Wife. This episode shows the great ideas that can be had in Doctor Who and the wonderful settings. There's so much great imagery in this one. Plus it showcases the acting range of Matt Smith to perfection, allowing us to see a more human side of this sometimes cold and arrogant Doctor.

If we're assuming the little spacesuit girl is more than human, because of the regeneration and super strength, then either it's because of Time Head, or because Amy is pregnant by aliens.  I think it's not a case of Time Head, since the Doctor blows off that possibility.  

If Amy is pregnant by aliens, then it was presumably an alien baby all along, nothing to do with Rory, and therefore she was abducted and knocked up *before* the warehouse scene where she tells the Doctor she's pregnant.  There is, of course, all kinds of missing time in the first two episodes.

It makes sense that the Flesh Amy is never pregnant and the real Amy is, that's why the Tardis gets confused.

In 2004, Hemming became deputy leader of Birmingham City Council in a deal where the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats shared control of the City Council. He stood down from this position on his election to parliament in 2005.

In 2007 he became Liberal Democrat Spokesman for the West Midlands and returned to lead the West Midlands Liberal Democrat team of spokespeople with Lorely Burt MP as the Deputy Leader.

1) Blink  
2) Vincent and the Doctor  
3) The Lodger  

All of these are stand-alones, each of which exhibits a different aspect of what's brilliant about Doctor Who.

Starting with Blink sets the tone of creepiness and edge of danger about the whole show, plus you don't have to deal with such a totally *alien* protagonist right up front, you've got Sally Sparrow to relate to and the Doctor is out there as a motivating force. When Sally meets him at the end, it's also the new viewer's first real-time meeting of him, and it's great. 

Then Vincent and the Doctor is a great story with great characters and a super sweet ending that plays the whole range of emotion the show can hit. Including the Doctor's surprising compassion for the episode's monster, which is an important aspect of his character for new viewers to understand. 

The Lodger stays sweet, with really super-lovable characters and an edge of creepy danger and full-on Doctor wackiness, plus it's got the awesome ""head butt memory transfer"" scene, which is what it feels like to be introduced to the series.

Switching between Tennant and Smith episodes helps them from getting attached to a particular doctor. You do have to start out by explaining a bit about regeneration, and probably what the Tardis is, and that there's always a plucky female co-traveller.

true,smileyman,smith,Smith,"I'm convinced that the Doctor has known since the very first episode that he's going to die. Consider the following evidence:

1.) He comes out of the bathroom in the diner (why is his special straw in the bathroom anyway?), and is slapped hard by River. ""I guess that's for something I'm going to do in the future?"" he asks. ""Yes."" is the reply.

2.) He shows off his envelope and compares it to the others. It's also TARDIS blue, and that clue was enough to send Rory and Amy hopping across the pond and getting River to pack her bags and leave the Stormcage. There's no way the Doctor doesn't know who the envelope is from.

3.) The Legs, the Nose, and Mrs. Robinson tell him that he has to go to 1969, even when he says absolutely not. He asks why. River says ""spoilers"". She only ever uses that word around the Doctor to describe things in his personal future.

4.) The Doctor asks Amy to swear on something important. She says ""fishsticks and custard"". Of course that's what she fed him the first time they met. It's another thing that associates this event with the Doctor.

5.) Amy and Rory spend considerable amounts of time huddling in corners whispering about the Doctor, as does River when she's with them in the opening two-parter. The Doctor is clever enough to pick up on all that. 

Remember, this is the same Doctor who realized that something was incredibly wrong in the Beast Below by looking at a glass of water on the floor and realizing it didn't vibrate, and seeing a little girl crying quietly and alone with nobody to stop and comfort her. He's an expert at seeing solutions from tiny clues, and these are not tiny clues. Now for the coup de grace on the theory that the Doctor doesn't know.

6.) The Doctor seems to be a bit telepathic. He's definitely on the exact same wavelength as the ganger Doctor, to the point where they're reading each other's minds. He can feel the pain of the dying Flesh. Amy told one of the Doctors that he died in the future. Whichever one of them that it was telepathically communicated that to the other.

true,Matriss,tardis,TARDIS,"See, one of the reasons I like her is that she isn't all that smart.  I prefer the more ""normal"" companions to the ones who are supposed to be geniuses--that's what I watch the Doctor for (not that the occasional brainy counterpart isn't fun).  The Doctor did the same thing with Donna: she wasn't particularly brilliant, but was a good sounding board and both of them would notice a tiny detail that he was missing but was obvious to a ""mere mortal.""  It's not so much that Rose and Donna are *smart-*smart, but they are fairly clever in a pinch.  I think that's what they meant when they talk about how bright she is (like in Shakespeare Code, the Doctor doesn't say ""Rose would have this figured out"" he says ""she'd know what to say to get me to realize what the answer is without knowing it"").

The Mickey thing?  That pissed me off too, honestly, she should have let him go or reciprocated.

Her physical appearance didn't ever really factor in to it for me.  I guess I chalked it up to Billie Piper being a pop singer and hung it on my suspension of disbelief.

A big part of what made her attractive to me as a character was how she helped 9 deal with his grief over the Time War.  She reminded the Doctor of how he ""was supposed"" to be (without knowing how he ""was supposed"" to be) by just being open and honest about things.  There was a lot of give and take between the two characters.  The Gelth was a growing experience for her (""Different morality, get used to it or go home""), Dalek was one for him (""It's not the one pointing a gun at me"").  That sort of thing led directly to 10 being the way he is IMO (I like the idea that the things that happen just before the Doctor regenerates has some bearing on his personality), but that's fanon.

What I like the most about her, though, is how much she grows throughout her time on the show.  She goes from a directionless young girl who screws up a lot to a fairly competent women who's bossing UNIT around because she's the only one who knows what's going on.  By the end of Season 2 she had no problem investigating without the Doctor's specific directions (and if it lost her her face sometimes, well, that's the risk a Who companion runs).  Donna does the same, but unfortunately loses all her awesome character development.  They imply that Martha grew up a lot during the Year that Never Was, but all the results we see are a willingness to accept the crazy alien shenanigans that go on around her (which is standard for a companion) and her coming to terms with her crush on the Doctor.

* Ends justifies the means? We don't know the silence's end goal.

You really used speech and description to make them seem bad/evil, but completely disregarded my point of us not knowing at all their reasoning for any of their actions (hence why i said to disregard those since we can't say they're evil based on those actions, without knowing their reason for action.)

Regarding the ""they can just leave"" do we really know thats possible? The doctor says that the earth is the center of their empire, perhaps they actually started out on earth. Perhaps they're trapped on earth. Again you're assuming far too much regarding the silence. 

The only thing actually going against the silence is the speech you quoted. That particular silence seems odd though, considering how talkative it is (in both the orphanage and after being treated by the doctor) compared to the rest. Perhaps thats just for plot advancement. But I don't think that was enough for labeling the entire species as evil bad guys.

10.) Susan - It's sad that she went from being ""An Unearthly Child"" to ""stock screaming girl"" but she's important to the Doctor's life.

9.) Amelia Pond

8.) Ace - At first, I didn't like her on TV (I thought she was just a stereotypical teenager admittedly with an explosion fetish) but I liked the dark soldier-of-fortune Ace of the New Virgin Adventures novels.

7.) Zoe

6.) Romana I

5.) Mel - I couldn't stand her overacting in the classic series, but she does very well on Big Finish.

4.) Leela - the original Xena.  

3.) Nyssa - Mucho fapping at age 12.  I have a thing for intelligent, cute brunettes.

2.) and 1, I can't make up my mind between Donna and Sara.  I think Sara is much more important to the series overall, but if I have to choose who I would actually like best if they were real people and I knew them, I'd have to say Donna.  

As for the rest, Peri had two nice things about her, and that was it, Tegan was just a bitch, Jo was cute but not that bright, Liz was bright but not that cute and didn't have the personality to make up for it, Romanna II was alright but nothing to write home about, same goes for Barbara, Martha, and Rose (as I said in another post I didn't hate her, just hated how the new series became a soap-opera focused on her for two years)  Didn't pay much attention to Vicky, Polly, or Dodo.

Ian was cool, but was admittedly just there so there could be a ""leading man"" in the series.  I miss the Brigadier and Sgt. Benton (Mike Yates was just there, as was Harry.)

Or maybe they were both telling the truth. 

It wouldn't be the first time that the Doctor's had some deeper insight into things than everyone else around him. At the same time, it seems like the Jennifer was the only Ganger who was really distressed by what the rest of the Flesh was feeling. The others didn't really seem to care very much, and I got the distinct impression that they only sided with Jennifer in the first place because they thought it was the only way to save themselves – none of them (other than Jennifer) seemed particularly thrilled about the idea of started a revolution. So maybe Jennifer was an anomaly, and Doctor Goo was as nonchalant about it as he came across as being.

Obviously I'm just speculating here, but when I finished the ep yesterday I immediately rewatched that scene again, and this was what I came up with.

It essentially turned out a way to extend angst between Aeryn and Crichton once she and the remaining Crichton are returned, essentially turning it into the John And Aeryn Show to the detriment of the rest of the characters.

I really, really enjoyed ""The Ark in Space."" Fourth Doctor, hard to go wrong with him, and Sarah Jane, too. The best of the best!

If you want to go first Doctor, watch the first episode of ""An Unearthly Child,"" but then skip to about either ""Keys to Marinus"" if you like adventure, ""Sensorites"" if you would rather watch something political or psychological, or ""The Rescue"" if you prefer a stronger teenage female companion.

Let's say she's been pregnant the full nine months. The earliest most women find out they are pregnant is one month in. So say she's been pregnant for one month at the time of IA/DotM. Then that's three months on the run, which puts her at 4 months/beginning of the second trimester. She should be showing by now, but is not. If the baby is Rory's, she was most likely taken during this time. 

I'm unsure about her being taken in FaS as well. Hell, she could have been taken while she was in the Pandorica, why not? The museum film did say the Centurion had not been seen since he dragged the Pandorica out of the fire. We don't know where he was from then to the time he shows up as a guard. Perhaps someone sneaked her out and the ganger!Amy in?

Well if were real Amy she'd show a bit, but ganger Amy isn't. I think that, although the tech used to make ganger Amy is more advanced than the tech in the last two episodes, the Flesh may not be able to cope with faking a pregnancy long term. Either that or the Flesh Amy was designed not to show, which makes sense considering that they didn't want anyone (esp the Doctor) to know where real, pregnant Amy was.

I think she must have been taken since before the first ep of the current season but (potentially) after the last ep from the previous season. The Silent tells her to tell the Doctor that ""which he cannot know and must never know"" right in the beginning of TIA.

I watched Pyramids of Mars, and was impressed, and we plowed through Baker's time with the E-Space Trilogy and then Keeper of Traken, Logopolis, and Castrovalva because it was at the library. My roommate also had Doctor Who and the Silurians, The Sea Devils (3), and Warriors of the Deep (5). Those were some decent stories! Get a feel for the storytelling. Then I started pushing through major story points:

**One**

* An Unearthly Child (episode 1)
* The Daleks
* The Edge of Destruction
* The Aztecs
* The Dalek Invasion of Earth
* The Tenth Planet

**Two**

* Tomb of the Cybermen
* The Mind Robber
* The Seeds of Death
* The War Games

**Three**

* Spearhead from Space
* Inferno
* Terror of the Autons
* Claws of Axos
* The Daemons
* The Curse of Peladon
* The Three Doctors

I'm downloading The Green Death now, but cruising through well-known episodes and story points is working so far for me. I am probably going to be a bit more indepth with the later episodes, as they are, you know, intact. 

Best advice: Do not watch serials longer than four episodes or serials that are incomplete unless you have a good reason to--you've heard it's very good (The War Games, Inferno) or you have special character interest (The Daleks, The Tenth Planet), etc.  ",0,1306723147,null,0,false,0,c1wqid9,t3_hn3za,t1_c1wqid9,t3_hn3za,1427193592,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I think Gangers won't play a role in any of the latter half episodes, but the Silents/Silence will. Either sometime in the 3 months between ""Impossible Astronaut"" and ""Day of the Moon"" or, if it were **me** writing, around 14 minutes into DoTM when Amy is in the room of sleeping Slients and the marks appear on her face and hands and the previously locked door opens from across the room, (before the first time she sees ""Nurse Ratched"") Amy gets abducted by the Silents and replaced with Ganger-Amy (GAmy, if you will). Because the flesh can divide its cells, but not ""grow"", that is why her scans show up like Schrödinger's cat.

Amy's child isn't the Doctor's and it isn't River Song, it's a regular kid. Going back to the RTD era, ""Parting of the Ways"" showed Rose was able to absorb time energy from the heart of the TARDIS, but Dr. 9 had to suck it out of her before it burned her alive. And in Neil Gaiman's episode, the soul of a TARDIS can be placed into a human body, but the host body would quickly burn up die.

I think the reason the girl seemed to regenerate is because she is full of time energy as well. That is why she needed the spacesuit life support system. The Silent ships were made by trying to create TARDISes, and somehow they took Amy's baby and either put the soul of the dead ship in the tunnels of ""Impossible Astronaut,"" or the ship above Craig's place in ""The Lodger"" or maybe her baby somehow ""got a time head"" from being conceived on the TARDIS.",0,1306725346,null,0,false,0,c1wqop4,t3_hmvv0,t1_c1wqop4,t3_hmvv0,1427193675,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I think either sometime in the 3 months between ""Impossible Astronaut"" and ""Day of the Moon"" or, ideally, (if it were *me* writing) around 14 minutes into DoTM when Amy is in the room of sleeping Slients marks appear on her face and hands and the previously locked door opens from across the room with a Silent just standing and watching her leave, (4 minutes before the first time she sees ""Nurse Ratched"") Amy gets abducted by the Silents and replaced with Ganger-Amy (GAmy, if you will). Because the flesh can divide its cells, but not ""grow"", that is why her scans show up like Schrödinger's cat.

I also think Amy's child **isn't** the Doctor's baby or River Song, it's a regular kid. Going back to the RTD era, ""Parting of the Ways"" showed Rose was able to absorb time energy from the heart of the TARDIS, but Dr. 9 had to suck it out of her before it burned her alive. And in Neil Gaiman's episode, the soul of a TARDIS can be placed into a human body, but the host body would quickly burn up die.

I think the reason the girl seemed to regenerate is because she is full of time energy as well. That is why she needed the spacesuit life support system, because she's constantly burning out. The Silent ships were made by trying to create TARDISes (The Lodger), so after they took Amy's baby, the Silents either put the soul of the dead ship in the tunnels of ""Impossible Astronaut,"" or the ship above Craig's place in ""The Lodger"" and were able to use their imitation Tardis to travel back in time and drop the kid off for the prequel to Impossible Astronaut and/or kill River's Doctor (age 1103)...

true,nonpareilpearl,tardis,TARDIS,"I think we've only seen Flesh Amy this season, and my main reason for thinking this is that the first thing the Silent does in ep1 (in the first 15 min of the episode) is tell ""Amy"" that she must tell the Doctor what he ""must not know"" and what he ""must never know"". In response to ""must not know"" she says she's pregnant, and in the subsequent episodes she struggles not to tell him she saw him die (until this last one when she thought she told the ganger Doctor).

I agree with you about why her pregnancy scan is all...wibbly.

Rose did absorb energy from the TARDIS, but that was intentional - she had to break into the TARDIS to pull it off. This isn't the same as just traveling in the TARDIS, which Rose and many other companions have done. The only beings we have seen with energy like that thus far are the Timelords, so I'm pretty sure there's something going on with the child being Timelord or part Timelord (the Master did take at least one human companion in recent memory and who knows what Jenny is doing).

The teaser for the next ep showed an exchange between the Doctor and the eye-patch lady where he says that ""the child is not a weapon!"" and she responds with ""but it will be"" (or something like this). I'm not sure if there is any wibbly going on from being conceived in the TARDIS (maybe), but I almost want to infer that the ""big bad"" intends on making Amy's baby into...something.

It would make sense that Moffat is making the universe trying to right its wrong, like when Rose tried to save her father in Father's Day.

He's got great little one liners, but the overall feel shifted backwards from the way I watch it.

true,MissCrystal,smith,Smith,"Tennant is gorgeous, and I adore him.  That being said, his chin is all out of proportion with the rest of his face.  So clearly you are able to ignore strange heads if you like the actor a lot.  That being said, I do see some Eccleston in his performance, this is true.  I also see Baker, and some Pertwee, and snips of all the others, frankly.  Matt Smith may show some Eccleston qualities that annoy you, but he's not aping Eccleston any more than he's aping any of the others.  He's had some moments where he's had Tennant's personality shine through as well.  

I think part of the problem you are having is that Moffat has pulled things in.  The scripts and the camerawork and even the acting are smaller and more intimate.  Some of that, of course, is the effects budget, but some of that is just that Matt Smith's acting is genuinely more intimate.  It's in the eyes and the subtle way his face changes as he's watching the person he's interacting with.  This is what made the Lodger so brilliant.  Tennant telegraphed his emotions a lot bigger, probably because he's a stage actor first and foremost, and on stage you go big or no one sees what you are trying to do.",0,1306732343,null,0,false,0,c1wr8es,t3_hn6y4,t1_c1wr8es,t1_c1wqwd5,1427193933,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

true,MissCrystal,smith,Smith,"Who are you referring to with the goofy happy bubble of glee?  Smith or Tennant?  Tennant had goofy and fun from time to time, but mostly what he did was start that way and then get sad and serious by the end.  Because what was written for him was so much grimmer.  

My theory has always been, at least in the reboot, each Doctor is a reaction to what the last went through.  Eccleston was fresh out of the Time War, trying to forget what he'd had to do.  His Doctor was pretty much all rage and anger and pain, covered with the occasional over-manic smile that seemed brittle around the edges.  He tried to be happy-go-lucky, but the pain was so fresh.  Rose literally saved him from himself.  He saved her like he did for the small amount of redemption doing so offered him.  

Tennant's Doctor had learned from Rose that rage is not the answer, that sometimes, it's easier to do things with love and kindness.  He was melancholy toward the end because he had lost so very many people who were dear to him.  He was slowly coming to terms with what had happened in the Time War, but he put so much of himself in every relationship, relied so much on his companions to make him more whole.  Tennant's Doctor was more vulnerable in a lot of ways than Eccleston's, though he was slightly less profoundly damaged.  By the end, he had managed to get his heart broken so much, he was pushing everyone far far away.  

Then comes Smith.  He's learned that relying on his companions to be whole ends in pain, so he's trying to stay distant from his companions, but he's not capable of doing so.  It's just not in the Doctor's nature.  He's very much the sort of person who falls in love impulsively with those around him, but he doesn't want to be, because he knows it will get him hurt.  He's trying to be more analytical, but he also has had it with losing people, so he's trying to be closed off in a way, trying to keep himself separate.  The issue, of course, is that he just can't do that.  Because of who the Doctor is at the core.  He met Amelia Pond as a child and therefore has this incredibly paternal set of feelings for her.  He's learning more and more about River, and finding himself fascinated by what he's learning.  He's sadder than Tennant was, less patient, less forgiving of himself, but he's also much more of a caregiver at heart.  Also, bear in mind we have had less time with him than we did with Tennant.",0,1306742246,null,0,false,0,c1wruv4,t3_hn6y4,t1_c1wruv4,t1_c1wrbgf,1427194227,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

First, let me say I started watching doctor who with Eccleston and Tennant, so that's why I think this way, but I think Smith is too 2 dimensional. Tennant did a proper awesome job at being happy, sad, angry... So did Eccleston, even if he didn't stay long enough to really prove it. Smith is just alien all the time. I thought it was because of the Doctor's character, but then I watched other clips of Smith, and he always has this awkward alien way of acting, a bit like Chaplin. 

He never did a good job at being sad. Look at (The Doctor's Wife spoiler) [when House destroys all hope for him. He's angry, but really, it doesn't show in his acting. In the end when he goes ""finish him off, girl !"", he's smiling. He can't be angry, it just never works for him.](/spoiler). Also, (The Almost People spoiler) [when his ganger loses everyone's trust, he gets sad, but you can seriously see he can't act it. Same thing when he says bye to Amy. There is just no expression on his face.](/spoiler)

Ohhhh. :O I just went back and looked at that scene (again, lol) and what he actually says upon coming back into the room is ""Did you sense it?"" I just assumed that the ""it"" was ""a psychic connection with the Flesh"", but this view of it makes a lot of sense. Still, it's vague enough to invite multiple interpretations, even now that we know (more) about what was actually going on (which I'm sure was the point, lol.)

At the same time, I'm wondering how much their respective reactions would reveal anything about Gangers in general, or at least about Gangers copied from humans. What I mean is, did the Ganger-Doctor ""sense it"" because he's the *Doctor's* Ganger (and therefore has a connection with the original Doctor) or did he sense because he happens to be a copy of the Doctor (and therefore has the Doctor's weird Time Lord brain powers to some extent)?

The threat of Soviet expansion was extremely real in the 40s and 50s, and various nuclear flashpoint events occurred throughout the cold war that could've led to a nuclear event. Without nuclear weapons during this period, the strategic military and political posture of nations such as Russia, the US and even France would've been substantially different during the cold war. There was a very real threat of nuclear confrontation, particularly over Germany. That's why we had a giant Nuclear mine in Germany.

The question that is asked is what is the purpose of a British deterrent in a post cold war era. To say that nations will not go to war with each other would be disingenuous, but the chances of war in the near future against a nuclear state are relatively small, providing that sufficient stability remains in the west.

true,MariusNocturnum,null,null,"I once had a dream I was helping #11 with an alien imposter called ""Skew-You""s. Like the Gangers, they are duplicates of the person they steal the identity of. The intriguing thing was they only appeared to be the original, but if you physically touched them you would feel the actual appearance of the creature, rather than the person. In the dream you identified them primarily by counting the number of fingers they had (the creature had six, but you could only see five, which meant you had to grab their hand and count their fingers by feeling), and feeling along the brow line (the creature had a brow line that protruded more than normal). So, if you didn't physically touch them, you wouldn't know the difference at all.

The intriguing thing was that I had this dream before Series 6 aired. Kind of spooky.

Also, something of humorous value, the reason I remember this dream so well was because I was apparently constantly grabbing my wife's hand and counting her fingers in my sleep. Was quite funny.

EDIT: I should note, it was The Doctor that called them ""Skew-Yous"" in my dream, not me, so the creature appeared to have been given one of the Doctor's silly temporary names until he found out the real name of the species. Never did get to find out the real name, though.

Otherwise, though, I quite like how huge the new Daleks are. They feel like they'll just roll over you. (There's an interesting production point there, I believe - the Eccleston/Tennant Daleks were built to be at eye-level with Billie Piper).

Here's my humble suggestion for all of us Yanks whom the BBC have slapped by putting us out of sync with the original broadcast:  
  
**Torrent it, download it, stream [episode 6] now.  DON'T pay for [""The Almost People""] when it comes out on iTunes or Amazon, if that's how you get it, and DON'T by any means watch it on BBCA if you have a DVR or a set-top box that monitors your viewing habits.**  Do the same next week, for episode 7, because otherwise you'll be behind on that too, and *avoiding spoilers for a whole week on the internet is like walking through a minefield.*  
  

If enough people do this, the accountants at the BBC will hopefully see a sizable dip in time-shifted viewing outside the UK and realize that they have just lost a bit of money on their decision to put the broadcasts out of sync.  Hopefully, they will get the message, and future seasons won't have these issues.

At the end of the season, or when the DVDs come out if you plan to purchase them, THEN put your money down for it to show that while you *don't support the distribution methods you still support the show and the individual episodes.*",0,1306785901,null,0,true,0,c1wudnc,t3_hn668,t1_c1wudnc,t3_hn668,1427195482,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

&gt; Couples who have different surnames make different choices about their children's surname(s). Various alternatives are used:
&gt; Most commonly, children are given the surname of one parent, usually the father's.
&gt; Children are given the mother's surname, although this is more typical in cases of single motherhood or divorce.
&gt; Female children are given the mother's surname, and male children the father's.
&gt; Children are arbitrarily assigned the mother's or father's surname.
&gt; The surname of a neutral third party is assigned to the children.
&gt; Children are given the hyphenated surname consisting of their parents' surnames, in either order.
&gt; Children are given a blended surname, formed from each parent's surname.
&gt; Children can also be given a surname derived from elsewhere in the family tree, such as the maternal or paternal grandmother's maiden name.

No no no. This is basic stuff. The stuff in 1969 hadn't happened in Amy's time stream yet. Think of the Van Gogh episode for example. The monster was in the painting the first time they visited the museum, even though they went back in time and changed history (erasing the monster).

My thoughts:

•""what he must know"" = that she's pregnant

•""what he must never know"" = that he's going to die. Which she eventually does, in E06
    the second point has a type I think. You meant to put that he is going to die, which he already has. 

So im gussing he went into the lake and was killed all as a distraction over all. To a plot still unfolding and to details we dont now yet.
then again I dont know why the suit was even in 2011, or what ever year they were in. So he might not have known his death was comming. 

Or what he should never know: not thats shes prego, but that the kid has already, more or less been taken.
Also the timelines with the girl seems fucked, because she is already born and in the suit, yet amy just gave birth. So it is must be the girl has already travled in time.

You can't carry the analogy all that far though.

Personal theory: River (who is, in fact, the child) does kill the Doctor (who is the Flesh Doctor) on the beach in Nevada. Then she goes on to grow up and become River and the Flesh Doctor is ""her Doctor"" (or another one is generated from the original with updated memories) and she meets him again later on (from her perspective) and he teaches her to be the person she becomes. The poetry is that the first time the Doctor meets River, she dies. The first time River meets the Doctor, she kills him. So, River knew what the picnic was but had probably been told not to worry when she found herself there. She thought time would be rewritten, hence ""NO!!!!"" *bang! bang! bang!* ""of course not""

As little girl she was ordered to kill the Doctor. She didn't want to do it but someone (the Silence or most likely whoever is behind them or who knows because *THAT* is the big unanswered question.) had her do it. Hence, ""It's ok I know it's you."" Then the Doctor shows up in his past, her future, and he teaches her and loves her, etc.

true,thedragon4453,null,null,"A little outside perspective:

While I don't find Doctor Who to be a kid show, I do find it's a good family show. I like watching it with my daughter (she's 4) and she enjoys it as well. I've watched quite a few eps from series 1-4 with her, and she's liked quite a lot, and most are not too scary for her. The basic plot points she gets, although some of the nuance is lost on her, obviously. I actually really like her enjoying this show because it sends good message (non-voilence, using your brain, strong science and reasoning elements).

Contrast with Moffat's Who, this season:

Ep 1: Well, 5 minutes in, and the doctor is dead. Also, I can't quite remember why, but *I'm* terrified. Probably not kid friendly.  
Ep 2: ditto  
Ep 3: Screaming banshee thing. Although, it works out in the end, still nightmare fuel.  
Ep 4: Here's a good one - except the giant, terrifying TARDIS hallway scene.  
Ep 5: The ganger faces are pure nightmare fuel for a kid.  
Ep 6: Ep 5 + hallways filled with disembodied eyes, and a giant pile of scary looking ganger faces. Jennifer's various forms. 

Basically, it's a bit of a bummer. While I think the show has gotten smarter under Moffat (this whole season's arc has me blown away), it's also kind of a bummer because I used to use Who as daddy/daughter time, and now I've had her up until 1 trying to comfort her because the Silence/Banshee/Gangers/whatever are fake and aren't going to hurt her.

Most of Series 1-4 were not scary. I think Moffat overuses the scary element a bit as well, although, like I said, I really like his writing otherwise. ",0,1306812683,null,0,false,0,c1wwr5r,t3_hnuir,t1_c1wwr5r,t1_c1wwhfa,1427196603,22,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,22

Also, since Rory wasn't traveling with them at that point, he hadn't seen Amy since before his stag night, if Amy was already pregnant before their wedding it kinda changes the tone of it (more like Amy forced him into a shotgun wedding to avoid having a bastard child).

New (to me) Doctor Who episodes are a gift from the past. My only warning is that if you get into them, the stuff going on right now in the show doesn't really have the same sort of excitement to it. You can watch a year or two of classic Doctor Who episodes before you get to a new episode of the current show.

That said, watching classic episodes is an awesome way to get a fix during the time off. I'm still in the 13th season, but at the rate I'm going, I'll be done with classic episodes before the fall season starts.

I will say this, though. The classic episodes have some amazingly cheesy effects, some strange subject matter, some dated views of the world, and are absolutely wonderful.

true,adamant2009,eccleston,Eccleston,"I think that, as an independent producer with relatively unlimited freedom to do as he pleases, Moffat is still kind of wobbling around, learning how to walk. He's done very well with it in a lot of respects, but I think this wobbliness is easiest to notice in the transition from series 5 to 6.

In series 5, I was a little put-off by the whimsicality of it all. Most, if not all, of the Doctor's previous demons (albeit there were a lot of them toward the end there) seemingly resolved themselves internally when he regenerated, and Smith's Doctor became something of a Peter Pan figure, young but old and mischievous and so very *not-human.* I have a friend who loves 11 for this very reason, that he's so carefree at times he's more alien than 9 or 10 ever were. It irked me, though. In terms of the episodes themselves, while I greatly appreciated the more epic arc in relation to the more episodic previous structure as I felt it had the capacity for impressive development and complexity overall, some things were just silly (e.g., candy-coated Daleks). It seemed like the whole season was nothing but a whimsical dream.

And then came series 6. I don't know if Moffat received a lot of criticism similar to mine, but he certainly did a 180. Series 6 has completely removed most, if not all, traces of the show that I would consider kid-friendly. [The Doctor dying right off the bat without proper resolution](http://reddit.com/spoiler), nightmare-fuel enemies (even for adults, let alone children), complicated plotlines that you have to revisit if you're just a kid and you haven't paid that much attention, and little nuances like the Doctor [reducing Ganger Amy to Flesh juice with nary a word of apology. Didn't he just get through telling everyone that the Gangers were as good as people?](http://reddit.com/spoiler) It's a family show, but it's supposed to be kid-accessible, and I don't think this last season has done anything to accomplish that thus far. In correcting the downfalls of last season, it seems he may have pushed the series too far in the opposite direction.

However, as a head writer, I can't find myself able to respect him. His whole 'time can be re-written' thing gets under my skin, because that's impossible, both in reality and in the show's history. As Hartnell once said 'You can't rewrite history! Not one single line!' That's another thing that bothers me about Moffat, is that he's been very critical and very harsh about the Classic series. That's not a writing problem, yes, but I find that hating, not disliking or not enjoying, but actually hating the Classic is just......I have no words. The other thing in his writing is the whole 'Wibbly wobbly', and the stance that many fans have taken on it. It's not a valid reason for explaining away problems, and in Classic/RTD, the problems would be addressed and fixed, like in Father's Day. Also, as far as him being some brain teaser goes, I don't find myself surprised from anything that he's written lately, mainly because it's obvious. He just throws a bunch of smoke and mirrors over them, like his enigmatic Season trailer, and his 'mysterious' Twitter updates. My last problem with him is that there has been very little character development in all three of the main cast, and even in River, although because of her coming and going through time she can't be expected to be that developed, and most of the development has occured earlier on.

I think they should keep that mantra and only do a Dalek story with Davros or another 'Human' bad guy like Van Stadt in Dalek.

I adore Matt Smith as the Doctor.  I'm not so adoring of how Moffat's handled him so far, nor am I so adoring of the over-reliance on arc-driven episodes when so many of my favorite episodes under RTD were single or double episodes that had little bearing on the overall plot. (I will confess: I love River Song, but I'm a little pissed that Silence/Forest got hijacked into being part of a larger arc, but The Doctor's Daughter is a one shot? Uh...wha?)

Dear Mr. Moffat,

Stop using Deus Ex Machina resolutions, make more solid stand-alone episodes (and stop retroactively making standalone episodes part of an arc you haven't written yet), and for fuck's sake stop making us obsess over every tiny little detail in order to discern your plan when we should know by now that you're just going to pull something completely out of the blue just to fuck with us.

true,Kiram,mcgann,McGann,"I do have a few complaints, in general, about Moffats run.

As with other people, I'm gonna jump on the bandwagon and say that he could certainly do with developing the characters more. I think that with the Doctor, at least, he's done a fairly good job of showing us what he's like, but either later this series or at the start of the next series, I think we definitely need some reinforcement on that point. 

I feel that while Moffat seems much more comfortable understanding and writing about the very nature of time travel (abusing paradoxes and time loops and etc) I think he is throwing away some really golden opportunities. River meeting the Doctor out of Order was...inspired, but a simple backwards progression seems entirely too simple. It's much easier to get your head around, but then what is the point of the diary? The diary is there to sync up the calendars, but it doesn't seem to be needed if they are simply traveling in opposite directions.

He seems to be casting a bit of a wide net with the overarching plotlines, but I feel that in series 6 he either needs to give us more to work with as far as working it out, or simply drop a few elements of the plot. Somehow, the whole thing feels like it's simply not fitting together properly. Maybe it'll feel better later, but at the moment, nothing quite seems to jive right, and I can't tell what it is. The pacing, however, of the overall story arc seems terribly off.

And, once again agreeing with some people here, I think that Series 5 was great because it did give us a rest from the build up of past enemies and drama from the RTD years, but we are on series 2 of the Moffat era, and I think it's about time we started pulling in more references to the past. It's cool that this doctor is forward thinking and wrapped up in his own adventure, but the past happened, let's acknowledge it in more than bits of paper. Have him talk about past companions, ask River if she ever met Sarah Jane, etc. 

For the most part, I really and truly love Moffat's run, but I think he is missing some grand opportunities, and it could always, always be better.

Rory, for example, has definitely been splayed out with the whole ""Rory The Roman arc"", his defensive nature of Jenn in the ""Ganger arc"", and his general attitude throughout the series. I feel like I know Rory pretty well; which, helps me identify and feel for him a lot better.

I completely agree with the ""show"" rather than ""tell"". Smith is great at it.

Various theories include:
1) River Song. She says in Flesh and Stone that she killed, ""a very good man."" Next episode is A Good Man Goes To War. Perhaps when the Doctor goes too far to save Amy, River has to do something to stop his downward spiral? She also seemingly, definitively knows that the next time she sees the Doctor will be her last(or something like that) at the end of Day of The Moon. 

2) The Doctor on the beach could be some sort of Ganger and astronaut could be the other(original) Doctor. 

One note about him knowingly walking to his death, he says he's been running for a long time and he can't run anymore. I don't think we've met who he's running from unless it's the Silence. . .which would mean the Silence return later in the series with the eyepatch lady.

When he does approach the astronaut he seems to be relatively familiar with the person saying something a long the lines of, ""you can take the mask off I know who you are""

I feel like a lot is being pushed aside for this rather dark and complicated story arc. We're no longer in ""spectacular characters in spectacular places in time and space"" mode. I'd rather episodes be more centered around watching the companionship between Amy, Rory and the Doctor grow instead of episodes centered around progressing the LOST-esque plot while the companionship takes back seat. They are such fantastic characters with interesting relationships that the show doesn't need all this extra fanfare that seems to be going on. I'd like to see the potential bromance between the Doctor and Rory blossom and talk about that than be confused at the end of the episode and have to wildly speculate about what is going on.

I like seeing 11 in situations that seem to match his personality more. He's more childish and these episodes don't play to that at all. It DOES make for good character development and drama, watching happy-go-lucky Doctor get put into some very serious situations, but I think it's rather unnecessary. The ""Happy Endings"" line with the balloon from almost people was GOLDEN.


Also if you're going to have an episode with two doctors, I think a vast majority of the episode needs to revolve around that. It's a goody from a bag of tricks that you can really only pull once, and it's too much of a comedic goldmine to take second place to anything else.

* Waters of Mars - Thinks he has licence to rewrite history as he sees fit but it does not work that way and he realises he's become a monster, trying to shape time to his own will.

* The end of time - He is forced to face that time lords again and force them back into the time lock destroying his chances of connecting with any more of his race.

&gt;Abortion:

Hosea 9:11-16 Hosea prays for God’s intervention.  “Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.  Give them, 0 Lord: what wilt thou give?  Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. . .Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.”  Clearly Hosea desires that the people of Ephraim can no longer have children.  God of course obeys by making all their unborn children miscarry.  Is not terminating a pregnancy unnaturally “abortion”?

Numbers 5:11-21 The description of a bizarre, brutal and abusive ritual to be performed on a wife SUSPECTED of adultery.  This is considered to be an induced abortion to rid a woman of another man’s child.

Numbers 31:17 (Moses) “Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every women that hath known man by lying with him.”  In other words: women that might be pregnant, which clearly is abortion for the fetus.

Hosea 13:16 God promises to dash to pieces the infants of Samaria and the “their women with child shall be ripped up”.  Once again this god kills the unborn, including their pregnant mothers.

2 Kings 15:16 God allows the pregnant women of Tappuah (aka Tiphsah) to be “ripped open”. And the Christians have the audacity to say god is pro-life. How and the hell is it that Christians can read passages where God allows pregnant women to be murdered, yet still claim abortion is wrong?

 

&gt;Infanticide:

1 Samuel 15:3 God commands the death of helpless ""suckling"" infants.  This literally means that the children god killed were still nursing.

Psalms 135:8 &amp; 136:10 Here god is praised for slaughtering little babies.

Psalms 137:9 Here god commands that infants should be “dashed upon the rocks”.

 

The murdering of children:

Leviticus 20:9 “For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.”

Judges 11:30-40 Jephthah killed his young daughter (his only child) by burning her alive as a burnt sacrifice to the lord for he commanded it.

Psalms 137:8-9 Prayer/song of vengeance “0 daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.  Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.”

2 Kings 6:28-29 “And the king said unto her, What aileth thee?  And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.  So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.”

Deuteronomy 21:18-21 “If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.  And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.”

Judges 19:24-29 “Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.  But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go. Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord was, till it was light. And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold. And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered.  Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.  And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.”  To put it very bluntly this poor, young lady was murdered by her mate for being raped.

Exodus 12:29 God killed, intentionally, every first-born child of every family in Egypt, simply because he was upset at the Pharaoh.  And god caused the Pharaoh’s actions in the first place.  Since when is it appropriate to murder children for their ruler’s forced action?

Exodus 20:9-10 God commands death for cursing out ones parents Joshua 8 God commanded the deaths of 12,000 men, women, and children of Ai.  They were all slain in the ambush that was planned by god.

2 Kings 2:23-24 The prophet Elisha, was being picked on by some young boys from the city because of his bald head.  The prophet turned around and cursed them in the Lords name.  Then, two female bears came out of the woods and killed forty-two of them.  You would think that God could understand that sometimes the youthful make childish jokes.  Calling someone “bald head” is far from being worthy of death.

Leviticus 26:30 “And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.”

1 Samuel 15:11-18 God repents of having made Saul king since Saul refused to carry out God’s commandments (i.e., Saul refused to murder all the innocent women and children.)  At least god realizes what an immoral, murderous pig he is on this one.

I Kings 16:34 Laying the foundation for a city using your firstborn child and using your youngest son to set up the gates.

Isaiah 13:15-18 If God can find you, he will “thrust you through,” smash your children “to pieces” before your eyes, and rape your wife.

Jeremiah 11:22-23 God will kill the young men in war and starve their children to death.

Jeremiah 19:7-9 God will make parents eat their own children, and friends eat each other.

Lamentations 2:20-22 God gets angry and mercilessly torments and kills everyone, young and old.  He even causes women to eat their children.",0,1306852484,null,0,false,0,c1wz58q,t3_hnxcl,t1_c1wz58q,t3_hnxcl,1427197728,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The Master spent *centuries* in a rotten skeletal body because he ran out of regenerations. Do you think he did that because he was scared of the Time Lord cops? In fact, he almost *tore apart* Galifrey to get the energies he needed to give himself a new life cycle and the Doctor, with the help of a whole Citadel of Time Lords (at the end anyway) was barely able to stop him. So, why bother **tearing apart your home planet** if you could just, you know, regenerate anyway?

Yes, could well be a couple lines when 13 regenerates into 14 (Hopefully less melodramatic than these):

(random companion): But the legends say Time Lords only had 13 lives, and you said this was your 13th body.

13th Doctor: I absorbed all the regenerative energies of the timelocked Time Lords (assuming this is still the case), and/or other absorbtion of extra stuff for more regenerations.

Or they do a whole story where he happens to find an old Time Lord box that bestows a new life cycle on him.

Or something beyond my own limited ability to plot out.

For instance, here's one: What if the number of regenerations a Time Lord had was tied to the (original) Eye of Harmony in some fashion?  The cost of the Time Lords and Gallifrey using this immense power source was that it, for some reason, constrained their number of potential regenerations.  The Eye of Harmony/Gallifrey are now gone (inside the time lock) and thus that particular constraint is now removed.

So, it's a ""law"" in the sense that the Time Lords weren't about to give up the Eye of Harmony to allow Time Lords more than 12 regenerations, but it's something that couldn't be haphazardly broken because someone like the Master just wanted more lives.

The problem I had with Aqua returning was I didn't think we could accommodate him in his favoured 'man in the hole' position, simply because we have 5 or 6 players who want to play there. But if he is happy with a central midfield slot then he would be a good addition to the squad. 

That said, reading between the lines it sounds like he really doesn't want to come back, if that's the case then we should be letting him go. It's more trouble than it's worth having a discontented player in the squad, regardless of how good they are.

Also, be sure to watch the 2009 Specials between series 4 and 5:

- Series 1 (2005)
- Series 2 (2006)
- Series 3 (2007)
- Series 4 (2008)
- ""The Next Doctor"" (2008 Christmas)
- ""Planet of the Dead"" (2009 Easter)
- ""The Waters of Mars"" (2009 November)
- ""The End of Time, Parts 1 &amp; 2"" (2009 Christmas/2010 New Year's)

The flesh Doctor would (probobaly) not have that ability, so over the course of time, he would age. Maybe the original Doctor realized this, that the flesh's body would eventually die, so he let him borrow the Tardis for the remainder of his life. This would play nicely into how the Doctor told Amy and Rory not to interfere with his death.

The only hole in this is that the Doctor attempted to regenerate after being shot once, but then was prevented from doing so. I think that maybe being in the TARDIS for 200 years had something to do with that.

Still, the question remains, who actually killed the Doctor in the first place?

I think Smith is incredibly entertaining but he is more difficult to empathize with than Tennant's more amicable disposition. Smith brings more volatility to the Doctor. Personally I like it and think it adds to the show's intrigue, but I can understand people not being drawn by it. 

I remember there was a thread a month ago or so -- someone complained that the BBC America pre-episode recap (quick snippet that introduces the show) for Doctor Who is from the perspective of Amy Pond. Their complaint was that ""it's a show about the Doctor, not Amy; why is it from her perspective?"" Well, as an audience, I've always felt we were closer to the companions than the Doctor. Every time a new companion is introduced, it's a chance to re-introduce the Doctor and his world. It's the old screenwriting trick of using the ""new guy"" on a show for exposition. 

We--the audience--are all ""companions"" along for the ride. The Doctor is our main character and protagonist, but he's also part of the mystery and enigma explored on the show. When the writers and/or actors evolve The Doctor's character by doing things out of the norm, it  only adds to the excitement. For me, the more unpredictable the Doctor is, the more entertaining the show can be. That's what great science fiction has always been about for me -- the unknown, the mysterious, the unpredictable.

I really thought this subreddit was so all over Moffat that nothing was ever wrong with him. Yes, if I can quickly list some points, here they are :

- He doesn't seem to have any respect for previously stated rules in the show like some people mentionned the Hartnell comment about time cannot be re-written.

- Doctor Who is a kid's show. A kid's horror show but still a kid's show. I love the children in me even though I'm 24 years old and that's why I watch Doctor Who but I feel like the storyline goes on for way too long. It's not that kid-friendly anymore. It hasn't become ""Scarier"" or anything don't get me wrong, it's not about being a pussy but it's more the feel and direction the show has taken that appeal less to kids.

- The previous point causes a lack of development in characters. It seems like all the action is focused on small drama and scenes or references that we'll get in the next season or The Doctor being all goofy and all over the place. Don't get me wrong, I like it but being like that all the time without any development is not terribly fun to watch. I'm glad we got to see more though in the last two episodes.

The sad thing is that I listen to Confidential and Moffat's interviews and the guy has got the right ideas. He just can't seem to put them to good use or make the most out of what he has. The guy uses paradox to explain everything for goodness' sake, it's annoying :P

true,watcher1027,clara,Clara,"Moffat is an amazing writer and I love what he has done with the series.  Its hard to find faults with his tenure, but there are some.  

As mentioned, character development isn't really one of Moffat's priorities.  I think Moffat's focus is on the story, which is more in line with the classic series actually.  The RTD era focused heavily on developing the Doctor and his companions (we saw their families and their lives outside of the Doctor, something that we don't really see in the classic era too often) and I think we learned more about the Doctor in those 4 seasons than in almost all of the classic series.  Now, RTD went a little overboard and it got a little too emotional almost, especially in later seasons, but Tennant was so passionate in the role, fans didn't really notice/mind (I know I didn't).  

Moffat also seems to have little regard with changing events, creating paradoxes, etc. Though it creates some cool story lines and he has a very good grasp on time travel, sometimes he can get a little crazy.  I mean, he blew up the universe and essentially killed the Doctor briefly last season.  Cool, yes, but not actually following the established rules of changing time, etc. (though, we certainly saw our share of crazy, over the top things in the RTD era *cough*stolenearthandjourney'send*cough*)  

Moffat also doesn't wrap up his seasons quite like RTD did.  We still have unanswered questions from season 5.  I kind of liked RTD's essentially stand alone seasons.  Everything was wrapped up at the end, but there was still always that one last cliffhanger to keep you watching.  As long as Moffat does indeed plan to answer all of these things, I will be ok with it, but I wish he would answer more questions.  

In short, RTD focused was character development and he knew exactly how to make an audience feel the emotion of the characters (I mean, my god, how many times did we cry during the RTD era?!). Moffat focuses on innovative storytelling and draws people in with seemingly crazy events that are later explained (hence his extreme dislike for spoilers).  Both are good.  I prefer Moffat overall, but he could draw on some of what we saw in the RTD years. ",0,1306860301,null,0,false,0,c1wzvlv,t3_ho13y,t1_c1wzvlv,t3_ho13y,1427198145,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

1) Why does every single guttural utterance immediately have to be made immaculate gospel of divine importance? Why can't River just try to shoot something, it not die (as I imagine is somewhat common in her travels), and simply say the common phrase ""Of course not."" out of defeated frustration? Why does it automatically have to mean she knows what/who it is and why it won't die? If she knew about the astronaut, why didn't she seem to show it anytime before she shoots at it?


2) The kid could be Amy's or it could be a big red herring. We can't assume it's her's right now. We can only guess it might be her's with the condition we could easily be wrong. For all we know, she might miscarry. Only after she actually gives birth to a Timelord girl (young Timelady?) can we be reasonably safe in assuming the girl in the space suit is Amy's.


3) How in the hell does any of the above give evidence that River was in the space suit or is Amy's daughter? You just pulled that out of thin air.


I've yet to see any episode where killing your younger or older self is magically prohibited by the Universe. Show me a clip where the Doctor explains that the Universe actively intervenes to stop cross-temporal suicide and then I may take any of this with any consideration.


4) Or are you saying that because whatever was in the suit didn't die, that means it's the little girl and because the little girl kills the Doctor, that means it's River? Because that's tenuous at best. Unless the suit has a forcefield, I'd think that shooting it would put holes everywhere and hamper it's ability to keep one alive.

I don't think she's necessarily a Time Lord, and I'm not sure why she'd be regenerating -- but then again, the TARDIS Matrix has always had wonky powers. And I'm pretty sure it has its own sparkly golden light mist, doesn't it?

All in all, I think it's actually plausible -- it would mean the Doctor's Wife was far more significant in plot-relevant ways that we thought (which, from a Doylist stand-point doesn't quite make sense, given that Neil Gaiman wrote the episode and theoretically came up with the concept, not Moffat, but I'm ignoring that for now. .. ), and all those lines ""Sexy"" had about being the last of her kind, and her sisters being dead. . . 

Additionally, it sort of makes sense that the Silence would want to somehow create a soul and soul-carrier for their proto-TARDIS, even more than they'd want to make a Time Lord. Though why they'd need Amy to do it is another mystery -- although, time-travellers are weird, maybe there's something there.

The whole thing, IMO, will be as follows. The Baby is nobody we know, Infact I see it haveing little to do with the child who we saw regenerate.

Or at least sending it far far away (Killing is better as a writter for a tragic moment) This is gonna break The Doctor. Rory is the man River kills. ""A Very good man"" "" A good man goes to war"" He will defy all odds to save Amys child, Even if its not his own. ""Time can be re written, time can be unwritten"" ""The Only water in the forest is the river"" Big hint from series 1 maybe? The army thats all ""Today The Doctor will fall"" are there beacuse of River. ""Today is the day he finds out who I am"" This is the point it all swaps. The Apex of it all. I think River will kill Rory to save The Doctor. Of course he won't be pleased. It's full of timey wimey holes but would stop ep one if its the same kid. The Kid is used as a weapon to stop The Doctor. By changing that moment he changes the world. Hence he sent the invites? However by sending them it could be The Doctor shooting himself. We shall see.

Series 2 -- Rose and 10 -- 4 episodes away from Earth -- One on ""New Earth"", One on a spaceship ""Girl in the Fireplace"", Two parter on the asteroid planet circling the black hole ""The Impossible Planet"" &amp; ""The Satan Pit""

Series 3 -- Martha and 10 -- 3 episodes away from Earth -- ""Gridlock"" Return to New Earth, ""42"" on a spaceship, ""Utopia"" at the end of the Universe 

Series 4 -- Donna and 10 -- 5 episodes (!) -- ""Planet of the Odd"", ""The Doctor's Daughter"", ""Silence in the Library"" &amp; ""Forest of the Dead"", and ""Midnight"" 

Series 5 -- Amy and 11 -- 3 episodes -- ""The Beast Below"", ""The Time of Angels"", and ""Flesh and Stone""

Seriously, after his big death-and-erasure scene last season, he didn't come back 5 minutes later, and they still did the ""oh, shit, it's not rory, it's just a robot copy"" before turning him back into a real boy.

So even if he dies and stays dead for a couple of episodes, it's still likely that Moffat would ressurect him in a big ""oh, a paradox, now everything is back the way it was"" finale.

Therefore, even if he dies I'm not going to be very sad because ""rory's dead"" is harder to take seriously than ""scary vampire fish monsters"".

Getting a character into danger and then cutting to another scene is an old trick for creating some suspense. I'm just thinking they've over-used it with Rory and didn't realise it would inspire ""they killed rory! you bastards!"" jokes.

(Not that I'm 100% sure you're wrong - but there's something very fishy going on if the abduction was prior to her being stuffed in the pandorica, and the universe exploding.)

An abduction before the start of the first episode of this season - being a time when the doctor wasn't around to keep an eye on her - seems much simpler.

Oh, and even though Amy &amp; Rory had a honeymoon that was literally out of this world, it seemed that they had gone back home to live a ""normal"" life, until the Doctor suddenly summons them to a really awkward situation.

It seems reasonable that these events may be connected.

The phrase ""River is the only water in the forest"" seems more likely to be a clue for something that's going to happen, not something that's already happened - especially given that the Doctor seems to have worked out Amy was a ganger without any reference to that.

&gt; If Amy is pregnant and then captured and cloned, why wouldn't the pregnancy carry across like the blood clot?

Another good reason to suspect that she was abducted and impregnated much sooner - so the ganger wouldn't be pregnant.

When i first watched Rebel Flesh, I assumed both Amy and Rory were somehow replaced when the storm hit. Look at 16:30, and Amy looks the same super pale color as that unstabilized flesh. But the Doctor said she hadn't been there for a long time, and on Confidential, one of the producers said Amy hasn't been around since the beginning of the season.

No, there isn't as much flexibility or cost minimization as you'd see in the private sector, but do you really value efficiency over quality when your loved one is going under the knife? 

Let's be frank. If you have a vital service where quality is more important than efficiency, the only way to do distribute the service is via a government program, in my opinion. Otherwise, the incentives of cost minimization/profit maximization evident in private businesses will be too strong, and thus, quality will be reduced in favor of efficiency.

For a quick example, take a look at some US state's prison systems. I can't recall which states have partially privatized their prison system, but there are a few. In those states, there are increased reports of abuse of inmates, as well as new problems, such as judicial corruption and intentionally sabotaging a prisoner's chance of reintegrating into society. It's bullshit! Private prisons are actively working to increase the chance for inmates to get sent BACK to prison! More business that way, and thus, more government money. It's a flippin' shame! What's worse, some prisons are paying judges a couple hundred for each person they send to jail. What the hell?! They're bribing judges to ruin people's lives here! It's horrible! There were already a few mass-releases of inmates due to this corrutpion, if I recall correctly...

And since she was connected to the ganger in real-time, for a long time, possibly when she first became pregnant... going back nine months should tell you about how long she's been pregnant and probably how long she's been in the ganger body.

We know there were three months between the end of The Impossible Astronaut and Day of the Moon's intro, but aside from that there's been little explaination of how long they've actually spent in the TARDIS because of all the things never shown on-screen.  But I haven't seen the Confidentials (except one) so perhaps it explains how long the season's gone on there?

true,drinian,null,null,"Not really: most American networks, even our many cable channels, seem to have this ""not invented here"" syndrome. Witness the recent remakes of *Skins* (by MTV), *Top Gear* (by TLC), and any number of shows on the major broadcast networks. This isn't always a bad thing, as the US version of *The Office* is, I think, fantastic. But it's as if no network wants to broadcast something that they can't control completely: it was kind of shocking when I visited the UK, and even more so Australia and New Zealand, as to how much American TV is out there.

For some reason, though, our public broadcasting system, PBS, spends about half their time broadcasting UK stuff -- that's how I got into *Doctor Who*. But it's bizarre, PBS is still re-running things like *Are You Being Served?*, *Keeping up Appearances* and *To the Manor Born*, not recent programs or anything controversial. A lot of UK crime shows and period dramas also get shown under the ""Masterpiece Theatre"" brand on PBS. They picked up *Doc Martin* about five years after it aired in the UK. Public broadcasting has a very different (and, sadly, diminished) role in America.

In the particular case of *Doc Martin*, I happened to catch a rerun of it on ITV while in the UK for the opening night of the RSC's *Hamlet* with David Tennant, back in 2008. When I got home, I ordered the Region 2 DVDs from amazon.co.uk.

Netflix is a subscription-based Internet video service. For about $8 a month, you get access to a huge library of TV and movies that you can watch instantly. While a lot of high-profile stuff is available, it's the producers of shows that can't find an outlet in the US -- not just UK programs like *Doc Martin*, but independent films and documentaries -- who have been the most eager to get their stuff out there.",0,1306885880,null,0,true,0,c1x2l0e,t3_hodsx,t1_c1x2l0e,t1_c1x1vll,1427199420,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2
