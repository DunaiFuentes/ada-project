to be honest I saw block of text and did the same then hit reply for this message haha. Fuck hold on

&gt;C's life gets written over by A as A catches up to C's point in time where C talks to A

I guess this is where I get lost or have a differing conception of how time ""works"" (as much as you can understand time from sci-fi). I think of it as all events happening at the same time yet still separate, so in my mind, that's just a different timeline/timestream/whatever term they're using this week.

That's actually why I liked the episode so much. In my view, the Doctor is really killing Amy. Sure, they rescued the younger version of her so from the viewer's standpoint she doesn't die. And yet, because they pulled her into the viewer's and older Amy's timestream and created the paradox there is absolutely an older Amy banging on the TARDIS door to let her in and the Doctor is using some degree of double-think to say ""she doesn't exist, she's an anomaly"" while he kills this woman. That's awesome because it shows how Timelords see time (in my mind) where this one won't exist anymore because other Amy overwrites her therefore I deny her reality.

If we're going with same timeline being over-written until it's consistent with what ""needs"" to happen (for the viewer's benefit) that's cool too",0,1321487695,null,0,false,0,c30dfqk,t3_mej08,t1_c30dfqk,t1_c30d8wa,1427887852,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Well you have to take into account that there is only one timeline in the show: The Doctor's timeline, from the Doctor's perspective, in chronological (from the Doctor's perspective) order. That's the show's reality. 

&gt;the Doctor is using some degree of double-think to say ""she doesn't exist, she's an anomaly"" while he kills this woman. That's awesome because it shows how Timelords see time (in my mind) where this one won't exist anymore because other Amy overwrites her therefore I deny her reality.

That's a cool perspective, I hadn't thought of it like that.

&gt;I think the main difference between them is, Russell is very much about big, bombastic brush-strokes. It's a real thrill going through one of his stories and very emotionally elating. 

&gt;With Steven, those clockwork robots of his represent his brain, really. He's very much about the individual pieces clicking together. But that said, there's a huge crossover between the two, because 'Midnight' was very much a Moffat-y sort of script, and something like 'The Beast Below' was very much like a Russell script. So there's a big, shared common ground between them, and they're both fantastic. 

&gt;They have a slightly different approach, but both love the show and they're brilliant to work with. In that respect, it's not really very different at all.

They both have their respective strengths (RTD for small, character-driven stories, Moffat for epic, tightly-plotted timey-wimey sci-fi adventures) and weaknesses (RTD's tendency to be a little too self indulgent, Moffat's capacity to be a little light on the critical explanatory details) but they are both amazing writers.

We have been very, very lucky to have had two such talented, dedicated writers helming the series since 2005. Without them, I sincerely doubt we'd be discussing the merits of the show as it presently stands.

Truly, the only real concern I have regarding showrunners is a matter of who will be taking over once Moffat decides to leave. We were incredible lucky to have Moffat waiting in the wings during the RTD years; as of now I am finding it very difficult to name anyone with previous showrunning/writing skills present in the Moffat era.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"Enjoyed the read. Just a few items of criticism/encouragement.  First off, expect people to have no idea which Doctor you're referring to.  In your intro you explain The Doctor and his race, but don't forget to explain that he's on X regeneration(I'm presuming it's 11). It also wouldn't hurt to toss in a quick description of said Doctor, just for those uninitiated.

Second, work on drawing out the story a little bit more.  Something helpful is that The Doctor usually likes to get to know and understand the beings he encounters. You don't have to rush into the action. Look at 11th Hour. Even with, what, 20 minutes to save the world he still finds time to conversate/get to know Amy and Rory(Even if it's a bit involuntary at times).  This will not only help to explain the characters, but start to make the reader care about them more as well(Until the inevitable twist).

Don't even be afraid to embellish to conversation between The Doctor and the Time Lord in the spaceship. A quirk of just about all The Doctors is that they hate being confused, or not knowing a situation. Bring the reader into that confusion by making the conversation seem very one sided in favor of the Time Lord. ""Don't play games, Doctor. You know exactly why we're here."" ""What are you talking about? I'm not even sure I know who you are."" ""Oh Doctor, you can be so naive at times...or are you just playing one on your games? It does get hard to tell with you."" ""Tell me. Tell me right now what it is you're doing here!"" ""Well, if you really wish to play that game, Doctor, I guess you'll just have to find out first hand.""

Honestly, you have a good story here. It just needs some good dialog. Give us reason to care about this alien race, make us want to help them ourselves.  Make us hate the big bad alien in the sky. Make us just as confused and upset as The Doctor when he can't figure out why anyone would wish harm to such simple creatures. Maybe The Doctor even lashes out on them, as he often does because he thinks they're witholding something from him. Maybe even draw comparisons for good foreshadowing. Doctor yells at the aliens, claiming that they must be hiding something from him, and they look back in fear towards The Doctor the same exact way they looked upon fear at the 'Alien in the spaceship'.

Ok, I'm done rambling. I only originally meant to give you a few pointers, and went on a talking spree. I always feel like a jackass when I say this, but it's a really good start. I always feel like a jackass, because I don't mean that it's not good. I mean that it is good, but still has potential to become a full story.

Kind of like SpasticPanda, and I realize this is blasphemous in light of his recent form, I am kind of hoping vdV sits in lieu of a 4-4-2 featuring Defoe and Adebayor partnering up top. Defoe's recent efficiency in front of goal needs to be fostered, and I really want to see how well we can play with a dual threat of size and speed rather than size and technical ability (with vdV). If possible, I would also like to see Kranjcar get some game-time as well, whether it is as a RM or CM. I would really hate for him to be written off, however I doubt he'll find time if vdV is in any way fit and can at least be used as a substitute. 

If Agbonlahor is injured I think we have a comfortable victory at 3-0 with goals for Bale, Adebayor, and Modric. I know Bent will always have a chip on his shoulder at WHL, but I think without Gabby the team is far too one dimensional to give Spurs any run for their money at home.

**Banned football fan to dodge jail after sectarian abuse chant** 

A BANNED football fan who sneaked into a Hearts game looks set to avoid a jail term after being caught chanting sectarian abuse.

James Begbie, 19, from Kirkliston, had already been punished for threatening Celtic fans on an away trip.

And on October 15 he managed to gain access to Dunfermline’s East End Park, a game Hearts won 2-0, through a disabled gate, after which he embarked on the bigoted singing.

However, at Dunfermline Sheriff Court yesterday **he was told he would probably be spared time behind bars because the offence did not take place around Celtic fans.**

Prosecutor Azrah Yousaf said: “This man was already subject to a club ban which prevented him attending games at Tynecastle.

“At about 10 past four in this match police became aware of a group of supporters in the disabled area of the ground.

“The accused was heard singing on his own a Hearts song called The Gorgie Boys. It is sung to the tune of the loyalist song The Billy Boys.

“He sang ‘We’re up to our knees in Fenian blood, surrender or you’ll die.’

“Fans around him were becoming unrestful about the words he was singing, and he was taken out the ground.

“Police had initially refused the man entry to the game because he was seen as a high risk supporter. He left the stadium but was seen to enter via the disabled access.

“He has another conviction for a football related matter.”

**He admitted the sectarian abuse charge and religiously prejudiced breach of the peace, but said he did not consider himself bigoted.**

Sheriff Craig McSherry said: “If he was saying this at Celtic Park would this maybe be a greater aggravation, I wonder?”

“Taking into account the weekend you spent in custody and that **there is no evidence this was directed at opposing supporters.** In the circumstances I will defer sentence for good behaviour for three months.”",0,1321521396,null,0,false,0,c30hknu,t3_mde93,t1_c30hknu,t3_mde93,1427889867,0,false,Glasgow_Celtic,t5_2rgo4,0

Bullshit.

When I left school in 1990, dole was 29.50/week for someone under 25.  Even factoring in a rise in benefit from the mid 80s, you would have had at least £50/week between you.  

Also you can't just compare 80s benefit levels to benefit levels now, without taking into account how much cheaper food/petrol/rent etc was then.

Obviously I can't cite examples of people who haven't finished their greatest works and risen to fame but, if you want a more recent example: Tim Berns-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, didn't have an engineering degree at the time he invented it (he has a physics degree). 

All that said, it's hard to take seriously any criteria if it does exclude most of the great engineers of the past. 

Without a workable criteria for defining who does get to be called an engineer, the whole thing is a bit meaningless. You can hardly say anyone can call themselves an engineer unless they work for virgin media, british gas, etc (apart from the fact that both companies probably employ lots of real engineers in addition to their installation technicians (not really sure what they should be called but, technician seems better than engineer)). 

Edit: You become a medical doctor by completing a medical degree or, a doctor by completing a PhD so, there is a clear and workable criteria there: you have to know your stuff before you are allowed to be responsible for people's medical care and, you have to have been judged to have contributed to the sum of human knowledge in a meaningful way to get a PhD.

You are lucky if you don't have ties (family, mortgages to name two common ones) that make it hard for you to move to where the work is. You are lucky if you have a stable, safe job right now, while the job market is contracting. You are lucky if you've picked up a good trade like plumbing or plastering that you can fall back on when you can't do a job you want to do.

It's unpleasant (as your reaction demonstrates) to admit that some of this is luck. Yes, a lot more of it is hard work, but to say that everyone who works hard will succeed is not true - you might misjudge the job market (some people manage this more than once in a lifetime), such that you get into being an expert typist just as typing pools evaporate, or a skilled homeopathist just as homeopathy is discredited, or a competent taxi driver just before self-driving cars hit the market at an affordable price, or an expert shipbuilder just as the UK shipbuilding industry vanishes, or...

Heck, it's not nice for me to have to admit that part of the reason I'm a well-paid software engineer is that I had a streak of luck in my early life; I was born with an aptitude for engineeringy things, in an era where computer programmers are needed (so not the Middle Ages, for example), to parents who encouraged me to improve my talents (and who let me investigate their expensive home computer - a BBC Micro - and encouraged me to not just play with it, but to understand it), in an area with a decent education system that equipped me to do a Computer Science degree, and a country where I've been able to move to where the work is.

With that said, yes, while us employed people have to accept that there is an element of luck, the unemployed need to remember that you need to work hard, too, and accept the work that is available to you.

I know alot of people who've told me your better off on jobseekers than in a minimun wage job because of houseing benifits (haveing the state pay your rent makes a big diffrence to your income). If they get payed minimun wage they have to give all that up in order to be fair to non-jobseakers.

I meen sure the scheme could do with some changes for example i would rather see this scheme implement where people worked for the local council instead of private companys been as the goverment is picking up the tab anyways. But this is a first world problem and if you compaire these peoples lives and freedoms to those of real slaves you might get a shock.

edit: thinking about it unemployment plus minimun wage plus houseing would work out alot better for me than my current full time job i'ed make the same an hour and wouldn't be shelling out 40% of it in rent. so if they do what your suggesting i'll be the first to quit my job and sign up to the scheme.

The point is that anyone with a spanner calls themself an engineer today, and it really damages the image of the profession: there's always been a shortage of good engineering graduates because alot of younger people view engineering as a dirty, rugged, manual job, and the amount of times people have assumed I'm going to be a car mechanic because I do mechanical engineering is rediculous....

true,keenemaverick,tennant,Tennant,"That was my torrent. I'm building a new one that's more complete - contains the last half of season 6, season 4 of torchwood, the rest of the Sarah Jane adventures, a few of the missing Confidential episodes, an animated 10th doctor special, 2 different reconstructions of Shada (one with Tom Baker narrating the missing scenes, and one as an animated 8th doctor special), and generally higher quality.

I've got an FTP server up with it all right now. I've just got to do some file renaming and re-organizing so it's all a little less jumbled then I'll have a new torrent up.

I've also got all 4 of the 11th doctor adventure games and the 11th doctor DS game, about 100 novels, and a few of the comics, but I don't feel that those collections are complete enough to put into a torrent yet.

EDIT:

Hurray for adderall and a slow day at work. I've finished!

I'm just copying them all to my external drive so I can seed it at home as well as work, then I'll create the torrent.

It's 999 files, 351.26gb. All the new show files are 720p wherever it was available (I think season 1 only had DVDrip quality). Not all the filenames are consistent, but I have at least made them consistent enough that they'll sort in the correct order. The christmas specials are included in the seasons and named to put them in the right viewing order. The extras include the Animated 8th doctor version of Shada, the 30th anniversary special ""Dimensions in Time"", 3 episodes of ""Doctor Who Greatest Moments"", ""The Curse of the Fatal Death"" comedy episode starring Rowan Atkinson as the 8th Doctor, and ""Dreamland"", an animated 10th doctor special about area 51.

I even made sure to get the extra scenes in season 5 (between the first two episodes, and between episode 5 and 6, then a couple more at the end of the season). Unfortunately I could only find them on Youtube, so the quality isn't great. But I think those extra scenes only come out to maybe 20 minutes altogether.

I'm pretty confident I can say this is the most complete Doctor Who video collection in existence. PM me and I'll be sure to link you to the torrent as soon as it's available.

true,Rahms,null,null,"&gt; You aren't making sense. You say there is only one type of engineer then admit that there are lots of types.

At no point did I say there is one type, I differentiated two groups: those who are designers and those who are able to fix things: ""engineer"" is a catch-all phrase for different types of product design/creation.  There is a huge variety as literally everything that is man-made has been designed, tested and improved by engineers.  Doctor is similar: there is a huge multitude of fields, but ""doctor"" fits all. 

&gt; The title of engineer belongs to anybody with sufficient qualifications and/or training, not just a bunch of labrats.

Well yes, this is the whole point.  However, what you're missing is the difference between the true meaning of engineering (i.e. design and creation) and the new bastardised version of the word that seems to mean ""can wield a spanner"" which is, in fact, a technician.  Engineering is about originality, not repair.  They are no more engineers than a ""house doctor"" or ""tree surgeon"" is a doctor.

&gt; I may be getting the wrong end of the stick here but it sounds like the people who actually work out in the field are supposedly not engineers in your opinion.

And what do you mean by out in the field? Plumbers?  They aren't engineering anything, they are fixing it. Google for engineering:

Your last 3 or 4 replies have been already covered in my posts, can you please read the words I'm saying instead of arguing against points that no-one has made.  Electricians are not engineers, because they are not designing or creating anything.  They are not overcoming new problems, they are going through a set of instructions they have learnt to repair broken products.  You seem to have absolutely no knowledge of what engineering entails (i.e. the work done by an engineer, the material learned from an engineering degree) which is totally fine, and is true for many professions.  The fact that you *think* you do, and your actual interpretation is completely wrong is the whole reason the title needs to be protected.

Tree surgeon is fine because people realise he is performing a task vastly different to a medical surgeon.  The fact that people do not encounter engineers in their lives, or see them on TV and so on means that these TV repairmen and car mechanics become what people see as an engineer, and it is very damaging to the profession.  If you can honestly say you believe a tree surgeon is similar to a medical surgeon, then feel free to elaborate as to why.

That is, not be inclined to prejudge the issue as a consequence of having been assured, repeatedly, for the last twelve years, by the entire press, that the men accused are disgusting racist bastards and definitely guilty. Judge Treacy might as well have told the jurors that they must approach the case 'by eating fifteen Jacobs cream crackers, without any water or other emolument, inside one minute'. The case is a charade, and a vindictive charade at that.

&gt;A few years ago two of the men not now facing a retrial were sentenced to eighteen months in prison for having thrown an empty paper cup in the direction of a black policeman. Eighteen months! But of course they were not sentenced to eighteen months for having thrown an empty paper cup in the direction of a police officer, they were sentenced to eighteen months for the crime of having not been found guilty of the murder of Stephen Lawrence.

I guess I'm just surprised that there are enough people who are in this situation, and *also* happy to believe that people not born in the UK are the source of their problems. According to the Newspaper Marketing Agency, [4.5m people daily](http://www.nmauk.co.uk/nma/do/live/factsAndFigures?newspaperID=10#circulation) read the Daily Mail. That's about 7.2% of the UK's population. (I know this is just one day's headline, but the UK's unemployment figure is [apparently](http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9R1OMC00.htm) at 8.3%.)

I used to live in the States, so I'm familiar with Fox ([this was a great introduction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xkRgXEb73M&amp;list=PL0AFA4D553C0515B2)). I'm equally surprised that they are so big. Is media like this creating people who believe this kind of thing, or is there already a market out there that is being catered for? If media outlets like this truly are more wrong than others (I'm sure the Guardian gets it wrong sometimes too) ... why don't people stop buying? I'd love to get something like [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/) over here.

It's not my intention to bash the Daily Mail at all - just to understand what's going on. It'd be great to get an AMA from a writer or editor at the Daily Mail.

&gt;Me: I just get so pissed off by the older generation.

&gt;Therapist: Why?

&gt;Me: Because when I grew up, we were forced fed the idea that if we didn't want to be 'flipping burgers at McDonalds' then we better go to college.

&gt;Therapist: And?

&gt;Me: And now we've gone to college, have degrees, can't get a damn job, and the same people call us entitled assholes because we refuse to flip burgers!

&gt;Therapist: Touche.



The current crop of graduates have been raised to believe it is a point of shame to take a manual job. Because we wanted them to have something better, we've used fast food as a scare tactic to motivate them. We have made it socially unacceptable to have a job that requires sweat and/or a uniform. We've told them since birth that those jobs are for idiots and failures. They are acting entitled to a good job, because that's what they've been told all their lives.

A conversion is all about getting a ""customer"" through to the next tier, where a second guy/girl will take their money before (I assume) putting them through to real support.

The magic of this is that everyone can be completely ignorant of what's going on, a kind of silent conspiracy. Department A is gathering leads for B, their targets are to get people through to department B. Department B's targets are to get money from people for department C who then provide support.

And that's debunked using things *actually said in the episodes*, not just making stuff up that makes sense.

Of course, there are still some inconsistencies, but to be entirely honest, Doctor Who wouldn't survive without them.  There have always been inconsistency in the whole of Doctor Who, but it's what Doctor Who thrives on. It thrives on change. I mean, if writers weren't willing to change Doctor Who, then the TARDIS would still be a time machine built by The Doctor, not a Type 40 stolen from Gallifrey.

Your sense of anger is lower than average

If we consider City, United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle the 6 best competing teams in the table , we've already played 5 of the 12 most difficult fixtures of the season.

And we've taken 7 points from those 5 games. Not too shabby. 

Most promising is the fact that of the teams on that list, only Spurs and United have even *played* City. So while we're playing the likes of Villa, West Brom, Stoke, Bolton, etc the next few months, our rivals are playing each other.

Indeed, City play Newcastle and Liverpool back-to-back, shortly followed by Arsenal and Chelsea back-to-back.

At this point my biggest worry is that City will hit a slump of poor form for the next month or two. It feels dirty, but that's the team we need to be cheering for the most in the coming weeks--aside from Spurs of course :)

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is something I have spent way too much time on, but here is the answer as best as I can give it (or the best answer I can fathom, not being a genius).

Time is the most important force in all the universe. With out time, there would be no universe, simply because with out time nothing could ever exist. I theorize that what ever caused the big bang created a paradox, basically, how could the big bang happen if nothing could happen at all?

So, before anything else, the big bang created time. It threw out this wave of 'time' that everything else is surfing on. The further from the central point of the universe, the weaker time would be (in my theory) and the closer you are the stronger it is.

But what does it mean that time is weak or strong? It doesn't mean that things more slower or faster there exactly, it just means it holds more sway there (fuck this is hard to explain, though it makes perfect sense in my head). The way I figure it, time is like gravity, the more dense the object the harder the pull of it. So, when you get a place that is heavier with time, then time is... denser, I would imagine you could actually feel it (the way you can feel fog I guess).

Sadly, if any of my theories prove to be true, there would be no way of knowing. See, we humans haven't evolved to consider time, so even if we were at the central point of the universe we would have no real idea (also because time is relative, so you never actually notice the difference in time where you are unless you know what to look for).

The Children of Earth Mini-Series fits in well pretty much any time after Series 4 of Doctor Who.  TW: Miracle Day can be watched anytime after this as it is almost completely separated from Doctor Who. 

That being said, you won't have much confusion as there really is minimal overlap.  Also, I agree with the others, if you want something really in the vein of Doctor Who, give Sarah Jane a shot.

true,ammig,null,null,"Now that you mention it, I've grown to dislike her character very much.  Although I don't think it's her character's fault.  To be honest, I've not liked this last season very much.  I'd even go so far as to say I enjoyed the filler episodes more because the overlying plot hasn't been so great.  I felt like nothing was answered from first seasons and we ran around for half a year wondering how The Doctor died, and then we find out it was really a robot.  Okay.  There was an blog/article post floating around here that summed up my feelings about this last season pretty well.  I'm sure I could find it if anyone was interesting in that...yeah. 
 
That being said, the River Song dislike comes from the character's role in the plot.  In Silence in the Library and Forest of the Dead, she was established as this mysterious backwards traveling friend of The Doctor.  That would of been super great, if it had been executed well.  It wasn't.  The inherent problem was that she was built up as to be as important as The Doctor, to the point where towards the end of the last season I felt like I was watching ""The River Song Power Hour: Featuring Amy, Rory and The Doctor!""  

The poisoned her for me.  Did you ever know a kid who had done nothing wrong to you, and was an all around nice person, but you hated them with a passion because of something stupid like taking the last ball at recess?  It's kind of like that.  I can see the interest in the character.  I really can.  But everything she does at this point bugs me.  All the innuendos and the stupid catch phrases.  (Side note: There's nothing wrong with catchphrases, but when they're repeated over and over it becomes an annoyance.  And I know, I know...The Doctor has catchphrases too.  But they're not beat into the ground over and over with every single appearance.  Although the community seems to have killed the whole ""_____ are cool"" for me.  I cringe when I hear that, now.  That's not to say I don't use that phrase too, however.  Moderation is key, folks!)

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"I don't have a ""BBC ID"" and I'm not acquiring one, so I can't do the test, but, assuming it's about personal morality, whether or not you _agree_ with someone's moral considerations and decisions probably isn't the point, nor is it relevant to the criticism of lack of context.  People may have endless capacity for rationalising their moral choices, or may merely wish to take elements that they consider important but that you do not into account, but that still means that, if they're not available to consider, the choices become arbitrary or meaningless.  For one person, discriminating on biblical teachings may be fundamental, for another irrelevant.

This isn't an argument for moral relativism, it's always possible to assess and validate (or invalidate) people's moral frameworks on the basis of internal and external logic and other criteria, but it does mean you can't begin to understand why they make the choices they do until you can see the bases and justifications for their decisions - and that requires extensive if not exhaustive contextual information.

Someone might, for example distinguish between stealing from Tesco as compared to the corner shop on several grounds, even purely from a leftist political perspective:

The relative needs of the large corporation compared to the small independent outlet (implicitly as compared to the needs of the thief and their family) (the 'social justice' or 'economic need' argument).

The relative amount of subsidy the two outlets obtain from their relationship with the State (the 'taking back what is ours' argument).

The relative levels of involvement in nefarious political and economic activity at home and abroad of the two outlets (the 'taking on the man' argument).

I completely agree. I gave up before the end of the first *proper* section. I was already somewhat irritated by the number of personal details they apparently *required* to conduct this survey, but I was willing to let that go in the interests of science. But I can't in all conscience continue participating in a survey that so utterly disregards nuance and context in its multiple choice options. All multiple choice answer type surveys are flawed in this way to some extent of course, but this one seemed particularly bad. 

The question about the reason for imprisoning people is what got to me. Only three black or white choices were available: 'punishment', 'safeguarding society' or 'rehabilitation'. I believe the vast majority of people think all three are important to varying degrees, depending on the crime and the manner in which it was perpetrated. Moreover, the very wording of the 'rehabilitation' choice was leading and biased in my opinion: *[…] so they can return to society when they have been 'made good'*. You can almost hear the sneer in the questioner's voice! It could have easily been worded neutrally using something like ""deemed fit"" in place of ""made good"" and dropping the inverted commas. 

And you have to presume that the results of surveys such as this will be used to produce headlines declaring ""public opinion"" as being ""for"" or ""against"" particular choices when nothing of the sort is true.

&gt;You cannot make a single currency without economic convergence and economic integration. It's impossible. But on the contrary, one cannot plead for federalism and at the same time for the enlargement of Europe. It's impossible. There's a contradiction. We are 27. We will obviously have to open up to the Balkans. We will be 32, 33 or 34. I imagine that nobody thinks that federalism—total integration—is possible at 33, 34, 35 countries.

&gt; So what one we do? To begin with, frankly, the single currency is a wonderful idea, but it was strange to create it without asking oneself the question of its governance, and without asking oneself about economic convergence. Honestly, it's nice to have a vision, but there are details that are missing: we made a currency, but we kept fiscal systems and economic systems that not only were not converging, but were diverging. And not only did we make a single currency without convergence, but we tried to undo the rules of the pact. It cannot work.

&gt;There will not be a single currency without greater economic integration and convergence. That is certain. And that is where we are going. Must one have the same rules for the 27?

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"I dunno when I tried to find a job last summer (not this summer, i.e. 2010) it was just impossible.

As a student I couldn't claim the dole which was annoying but also meant I didn't have any stupid courses to attend which seem to exist solely to funnel money into the private contractors that deliver them rather than actually train or educate the unemployed.

I can't drive which was a major restriction to be fair - but even if I could none of the jobs offered enough hours or a good enough wage to make up for travel costs (be that the extremely high cost of running a car, especially when young and newly qualified, or using public transport). So once travel was factored in I'd be working for a pittance (well, well below minimum wage) and so it really wasn't worth it - it certainly wouldn't have been enough to live off.

Fortunately I had the choice (although not happily) to just sit at home applying unsuccessfully for the jobs that were worthwhile (including ASDA etc. I'm not some stuck-up guy who only wants the perfect job) whilst studying physics books etc. for my degree so as not to completely waste the summer. Many are not so lucky.

I think the morons on JSA are just the very visible minority. ATM, 1 in 5 young people are unemployed. That's a horrific statistic (and IIRC doesn't include full time students as they are economically inactive, not unemployed) and graduate unemployment rates are similarly depressing let alone general unemployment. I mean I think it's very hard for young people who generally lack experience etc. but I can't imagine it's easy for older workers either.

A great place for stuff is the Big Bargain Company on the Hillview Road (Belfast). They do everything from decorations to gifts. I got my halloween costume there, it has everything and it's very cheap.

When popular society changes its mind, then so do the rights and wrongs that were once considered sacrosanct or abhorrent.

If you consider EVERYTHING within the Whoniverse, then you'll never get anywhere. There's always something that will contradict something else, because the writers are always revitalizing the series with their own writing.  Sometimes it gets explained away, but most times it doesn't. For example, next time there's a major paradox, if the reavers don't show up then we probably won't get some explanation. It'll be more likely that whatever current showrunner decided that they're a one time construct that only gets in the way of the story they're trying to tell. This sort of thing has happened millions of times.

Now, plot holes within a particular showrunner's time? Sure, that's completely logical. Using the same example, I wouldn't personally bat an eyelash if the reavers didn't show up in Moffat's Who. However, if there was a time when they *should* show up in RTD's Who then I would certainly bring it up. They were introduced during his tenure. Don't bring something like that up if you yourself are just going to abandon it.

The thing I don't like about plot holes is just how people react to them, to be honest. This is a slight tangent, but people seem to love to point out 'plot holes' and 'inconsistencies' when there are none. It's true of any show, especially sci-fi.  I don't mind when people say,""Hey, I noticed X, but shouldn't it be Y?"" because that creates a discussion, and possible resolution. Like the person forgot about the scene in which Y replaced X. However, this isn't how it goes 90% of the time. Most times people just come in screaming,""OMG! This show is full of plot holes! I totally saw X, but it should have been Y!

*  Big landowners measure their holdings by the square mile; the average Briton living in a privately owned property has to exist on 340 square yards.
*  Each home pays £550/ann. on average in council tax while each landowning home receives £12,169/ann. in subsidies. The poor subsidising the super rich. In Ireland where land redistribution occurred, there is no council tax.

If you look at the case of Sean Duffy, he was going out of his way to inflict emotional harm, and was jailed under the Malicious Communication Act 1988, a 23 year old law which covers everything from sending letters to cool, modern terms like internet trolling. The only reason you know about this case is because it involved facebook, had he sent letters then you would never care.

Essentially, these laws do have good reason to exist. Freedom of speech does come with responsibilities, it is not a free for all to be able to wander down the street yelling nigger at people, taunting the victims of suicides, or making up lies about people for the sole purpose of destroying their reputation. However, none of these laws prevent you from saying exactly what you think about the government, which is the important bit. But what I would say needs looking at is libel laws, especially when it involves corporations or people/organizations selling snake oil.

As for ASBO's, they are pointless. It is essentially a way of sending someone a letter that clearly and assertively states ""please stop doing that"". A legal boondoggle if there ever was one. But there does need to be a mechanism in place to stop persistent shop lifters from going into malls, drunken teenagers from hanging around outside local shops making everyones lives a misery, or people from causing ASB.

true,pizza617,null,null,"&gt; I don't believe the public can be trusted with guns.

Why? In the US their are literally 9 guns for every 10 people. Considering so many of us are armed, you hardly *ever* hear about gun accidents. Gun crime is mostly limited to the black and hispanic neighborhoods where criminals target each other.

&gt; I wouldn't trust myself with one, and even if I was in a position where I'd need it I don't know how effective I'd be with one.

Why wouldn't you trust yourself with a gun? Because in movies and TV shows they often ""accidentally"" fire? That doesn't actually happen in real life unless you're a fucking retard. No modern handgun will ""just fire"" without your having squeezed the trigger. I've been carrying a Glock 23 in condition 1 (this means it's ready to fire. cocked, round chambered, no safety.) for 4 years now. I holster and unholster my gun multiple times a day and I know it's not going to just fucking fire as if it has a mind of its own. I know this because I understand how firearms function internally rather than receiving my education from action moves and crime-dramas on TV.

&gt; Non-lethal methods of self defence (e.g. pepper spray) are in my opinion a better opinion.

In my opinion, the option that provides me the greatest chance of survival is the ""better"" option. If somebody is coming at me with a knife... I'm not spraying them in the eyes with pepper spray, I'm drawing my Glock and squeezing rounds off until they're no longer a threat.

true,pizza617,null,null,"&gt; But the point is, more people have guns = more people get shot, and as a weapon guns are pretty likely to kill you.

I can agree with you on this. We obviously have way more guns and with it comes far more shootings. I can somewhat agree that a gunshot wound is likely to result in death.

&gt; I don't trust myself with a gun because I doubt I'd actually be able to shoot anyone even if I wanted to. By the time I reacted I'd probably have my own gun grabbed and turned on me.

No offense, but if that's the case you likely fucked up by being oblivious to your surroundings. I often hear people arguing that you can't draw a weapon in time because your attacker will be on top of you before you even know they're a threat. I know first hand this is NOT the case because I've had to draw my weapon in a potentially dangerous situation before. I was at a gas station in a bad neighborhood in the middle of the night in the dead of winter. I was the only car there (or anywhere nearby) and the attendant for the station was inside behind one of those thick glass windows. I remember spotting somebody crossing the street towards the gas station out of the corner of my eye who I immediately decided to keep my eye on. As it became clearer that he was approaching me, I made a subtle movement under my jacket to firmly place my hand on the grip of my Glock 23. When he was about 40 feet away I remember saying ""What's up? Can I help you?"" to which he muttered something about wanting a light for a cigarette. I quickly told him to not come closer, explaining that I didn't have a ligher. At this point his face contorted for a few seconds, looking genuinely mad, before he started towards me again more briskly. I took a few steps backwards, drew my Glock, and trained it on his chest when he was maybe 15 feet away from me. He literally stopped dead in his tracks staring down the barrel of my gun, almost seeming to doubt that it was real. His expression had gone from anger to confusion. After what seemed like an eternity but was likely no more than a few seconds, he quickly turned around and sprinted off.

Have you ever watched Animal Planet? You know when they show the Lions methodically circling a Zebra while licking their lips? All while the Zebra seems completely oblivious until the very last second... Humans aren't all that different. If you're aware of your surroundings, you should be able to pick up on if somebody means you harm well before they're ""on top"" of you.

This isn't how things change. Very, *very* occasionally a one-off action leads to change. Most of the time change comes about through the patient, principled, persistent hard graft of people who are prepared to organise and engage in a long-term process of political engagement and public argument. Some of the Occupy protesters are admirable in that regard (certainly not all) and this may yet become a movement that has a lasting effect, but gushing about change in such effusive terms just because someone is squatting in an empty building belonging to a bank tangentially related to the UK's financial crisis seems a little slacktivist to me.",0,1321659217,null,0,false,0,c30yc5v,t3_mgt5l,t1_c30yc5v,t1_c30tsxj,1427897903,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

We are well known within the industry as one of the few surviving customer-based, do-whatever-is-required British manufacturers.

The owner started the business in his garden shed almost forty years ago, and now he's a multi-millionaire.

The thing is, he's old-school. Unlike a lot of businessmen, he still believes in the values he started with. We take on apprentices every year. We manufacture everything in-house. We don't have *any* automated systems. Yes, we use machines like lathes, etc, but they all require at least semi-skilled operators to use them. More than half the workforce is made up of 'poorly-educated', but highly trained and skilled factory/engineer/service engineers who actually care about the company, and the products we produce.

The decline in the manufacturing industry is as much the fault of the owners of the British factories as anything else. If they still wanted to promote British-built products, they could, and they could still make a mint off it. The problem is, they see a quick way of cutting costs by outsourcing, and it is them who have decimated the British market, pure and simple.",0,1321660859,null,0,false,0,c30yjvz,t3_mh43p,t1_c30yjvz,t1_c30wzzk,1427898004,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

So the article is being a bit unclear on this fairly important distinction.

If it's the latter case then the cops *are* policing by consent and following the will of the community. The cynical side of me says that they'd only follow such a line when it suits them, from the point of view of budgetary constraints on this occasion.

Personally, I drive fast motorways, but am in favour of 20mph limits in certain places - much of Islington seems appropriate for the latter, at least the side-streets which are narrowed to a single-lane wide by a row of cars on each kerb.

It's also worth pointing out that speeding in London is *rampant* - if you live and work in the most of Greater London you routinely get snarled up in long, slow traffic jams which persist much of the working day, so it's a relief when the roads are clear and you can dash through.

Well, one way is to trust credible official sources, unless it can find good reason to disbelieve them.

I assume that's what's happened here. 

The Guardian will have researched on its own into whether Duggan was armed or not. It will have kept an ear to the ground for what other newspapers have found. It will have sources inside the police. And it also has the results of this investigation by the IPCC. It has good reason (from the IPCC for example, but perhaps other sources) to no longer believe the information the Met orignally gave to the IPCC. So its decided to say ""Duggan wasn't armed"". That's what the editors of the Guardian think is true. Perhaps it isn't, but it seems to me that they have a reasonable amount of evidence to think it true, and have come to a reasonable decision in deciding to publish the assertion that Duggan wasn't armed.

You seem to disagree.

I agree whole-heartedly, which is why I put 'poorly-educated'. The truth is, they *were* poorly educated at school, but they were all trained on the job.

Most of our workers were taken on straight from school, some even earlier as apprentices. They were trained on the job, just like they used to be during the hey-day of British manufacturing.

I don't agree that the education system is suddenly failing them, because it is doing no more or less for people like them than it ever has. The difference now is in the employers. They used to encourage school-leavers, take them on and train them, but that hardly ever happens any more. Eighty percent of our employees are/were local boys, taken on between 16 and 19, and trained on the job. The average employee stays with the company for fifteen to twenty years.

Again, the problem isn't suddenly the education system, because that hasn't really changed in the respect of how it deals with the less-academic students. They were always left by the wayside, and the employers took them up. But now it's the employers who have changed. They used to actively encourage people to join apprenticeships, but now they just don't care for the hassle, for reasons I can't quite fathom.

Furthermore you are extremely regretful, but you will be obliged to initiate small claims court proceedings if the bill is not paid within 14 days. Naturally they will understand the need for this, not only considering the number of bankruptcies caused by the current economic climate, but because you're sure they don't work for free and that they expect to be paid promptly by their own customers. 

You are extremely glad to hear that they're so pleased with your previous work that they'd like to commission you for more - you're delighted and looking forward to working with them again soon, but you need to be paid for the labours you've already completed on their behalf.

If you phrase this correctly - a mix of upbeat and regret - then they only cast themselves in a negative light if they don't pay up immediately. 

--- 

I used to work for a largish owner-managed company that took weeks and months to pay their own bills - typically waiting until they'd had the second red letter - and yet which was persistent as a bulldog when their own customers were a day late with payment. They were not very nice people to work for or deal with.

Speaking for myself, customers who don't pay their bills are amongst the most frustrating aspects of self-employment. I think the *very most* frustrating experience of my self-employment was a customer who went bust owing me money - it gave me the feeling that the law had legitimised him not paying me.

It was particularly aggravating because he was a regular customer, he seemed like a nice bloke and I didn't need the money urgently, so I had not bothered to chase the debt. When he went belly up it turned out that he'd been loaned tens of thousands of pounds by his bank(s) - some of his bad business decisions I was already aware of - and they would be getting  95% or more of his company's meagre assets.

It wasn't even worth me filling out the form for the liquidators (who would be paid in full for their part in the dissolution of the business), because I would be unlikely to see even 5% of the £500 he owed me.

So this guy with his own home (I rent), who drives a much nicer car than me, got to walk away from paying a tradesman because he'd covered his ass with a limited company. He had owed me for weeks, and had I pursued the payment and taken him to small claims court in good time, I would likely have been paid in full.

The partner of another company I did work for phoned me up shortly before they went bust, just to check that they didn't owe me any money. I did work for the other parter for some time afterwards, and when he first saw me after the liquidation he double-checked that they hadn't owed me anything, so that he could cash me out of his own pocket, if necessary.

true,widgetas,null,null,"Sorry, I deleted that comment as I've had a few beers and so let loose. I couldn't be bothered with the fall out so I got rid of it. That was of course before I saw your reply. It's *very* hard to make oneself understood on this topic, in my experience.

The overwhelming assumption always seems to be: Someone is criticising Islam therefore that someone is Islamophobic/racist.

While of course I can agree that sometimes this is the case, and also that it is the cry from the BNP/EDL etc., this is infuriatingly not the case. Not in mine, at least.

But I shall respond to your comment.

&gt; He has absolutely zero evidence that this has anything to do with Islam

But he didn't absolutely conclude that it was. He said this:

&gt; That is really the only thing I can find that would cause offence, and even that is reaching a bit.

He has gone out on a limb and has found the only possible reason that makes any sense but has said that this is going to be an extreme.

&gt; Otherwise I feel it might just be shit stirring, which I have seen too much of.

And this is the problem of which my earlier comment was speaking. Perhaps it's stirring, but in my experience the *assumption* of shit stirring is enough to close down any sort of conversation. That, I think, is a major and dangerous problem. If you have a chance, have a listen to Anne Marie Waters a little way down the link [here](http://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2011/09/14/secularism-2011-part-1/). She spoke at the Secular Conference (which I attended) back in September and detailed the problems her group, One Law for All, had encountered when demonstrating. Anti-facist groups had sided with anyone other than OLfA as they had assumed that OLfA were EDL sympathisers and similarly the EDL had assumed OLfA were on their 'side'! This is a very real problem and demonstrative of what I was attempting to detail in my earlier comment - Very often any criticism of Islam is deemed as therefore being *anti*-Islam.

I realise where you're coming from here, with regard to telling OP not to assume, but really he's not doing anything wrong and has made sure not to outright accuse Muslims of anything. He is simply musing on the subject and asking others if they have had similar experiences. There is nothing wrong with that, nor should it be taboo simply because it is connected to a religion that some people are misinformed about.

As with the issue I raised, [which I'll link to again here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/jfwae/has_anyone_seen_any_women/), it's seems that people thought I was out to bash Islam in general, which is/was infuriating. The only comment I got was along the lines of ""It's none of your business"" which was, frankly, incredibly naive and idiotic. I'm as far from the BNP as you can get, but that doesn't mean I can't see issues with Islam or at least the way some people will use or treat it.

We should not be shutting down discussions like this automatically. While I agree there are going to be some contributors who will need to be put right, we shouldn't be shying away from these topics simply because those idiots will come out of the woodwork.

Generally, yes. Officers over here in the US are almost always trained to draw and train their weapons on a suspect they believe to be armed. They however will not actually fire until a weapon has been presented. Sometimes the police mistake another object for a firearm and open fire too quickly. [Deandre Brunston was killed by the LASD when sheriffs mistaken a sandal for a handgun.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5_KUDKUvlw)

Rules on the use of deadly force vary greatly between the various states in America, so I'm unsure how officers in the UK are trained.

With Liverpool, I would be shocked if the racism suspension comes to fruition, but if it does they will be in trouble. However, it is important to note that Carroll has been missing some point-blank chances that he is not going to miss all year. Eventually he is going to start scoring and they are going to be less dependent on Suarez. And for Newcastle, I'm not sure what God Alan Pardew has been praying to for their form, maybe it's the God of really easy early season scheduling, but I sure am ready to see them slowly slide down the table. 

With regard to Spurs, it will all come down to performances against teams outside of the top 6. We seem to have gotten rid of our scoring issues from last year, so the main thing will be our defense staying consistent and allowing us to win those 1-0, 2-0, 2-1 games.. These are games in the past that we would either not score to begin with or give  away a cheap goal leading to a loss or draw. Our midfielders need to calm down, control the ball, and wait for the right moments - this has been the clear distinction between games we have comfortably won and games that have been nail-biters. 

tl;dr - Spurs win the Carling Cup, Europa League, Premier League, Champions League, Euro 2012, and WC 2014..

To be honest, it's terribly written. I mean, *bad*. The writing style made me feel like every quotation was delivered in the worst possible flat manner (if you watch Avatar: The Last Airbender, check out the episode ""The Ember Island Players"", and you'll know what I mean. Or any of Sigourney Weaver's acting.)

That said, it's the Doctor. It was $3, and I loved it. Really while the writing is sometimes cringe worthy, I got a lot of entertainment out of the 180 pages at 12 pt. font. I'm going back to buy more because while the quality is on the low side, the entertainment value is pretty darn good.

EDIT: A quotation:

*Lester, Harry and Sarah carried the concious Warner out of the room. Mechanically, Stevenson sttarted checking over his instrument panel. The Doctor wandered around the room as if he didn't quite know what he was looking for, stooping to examine some tiny scratches on the wall and floor.*

*(In his tiny metal walled room, Kellman sat hunched over a listening device. It had been a simple matter to 'bug' the control-room, and now he wanted to know what this too-knowing stranger was up to. The voices of the Doctor and Stevenson came through quite clearly.)*

*The Doctor found yet another tiny scratch on the edge of the instrument console. 'Have you noticed these rather strange scratches, Commander? They seem to crop up all over your base.""*

Terry Nation was also the only person allowed to write a Dalek story for DW. The one time the show 'accidentally' breached this, with 'Day of the Daleks', they had to add another Dalek story, 'Planet of the Daleks', to the schedule in order to appease Nation.

For the new series, the episode 'Dalek' was in danger of not containing a Dalek due to stalled negotiations with the estate. I suspect a component of the final contract was the Daleks must appear, along with a paid fee for their appearance, at least once in every series of DW.

Most of yesterday's obits focused on Danger Mouse, but Mark Hall and [Cosgrove Hall's](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosgrove_Hall_Films) work went much further than that.

[Jamie and the Magic Torch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_and_the_Magic_Torch) was hugely popular, [Chorlton and the Wheelies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorlton_and_the_Wheelies) went worldwide, and their version of Wind in the Willows won Bafta and Emmy awards.

I think one of the reasons that Danger Mouse was so popular was that it crossed the audience line, it was a cartoon which appealed to both kids and (often secretly) to adults.

Fun fact, Bernard Sumner (Joy Division, New Order) worked for them.

The DWP's public statements dripping with concern for the vulnerable and empathy for those who don't know the 'dignity' of work are just the tip of a pus-filled bubble of deceit.  They constantly leak lies and misleading information to the press in order to turn the public against the idea of a welfare state in these straightened times.  Look at this very story - the DWP has pointed out to the media that '%77 of GP's have signed someone off for reasons other than physical health'.  This is meant to convince us that GP's aren't the right people to decide whether someone is sick or not, but rather we should have non-doctors making those decisions by asking a series of set questions and ticking off against a checklist provided by a company who has every financial incentive to throw anyone and everyone off of their benefit.  A for-profit company that infamously gets it horribly wrong all the time, to boot.  But all the statistic actually states is that GP's may have signed off people for mental health problems - presumably ATOS would never sign anyone off for mental health problems because that won't be on their checklist.

My only point is that when the speculation *is* Islam related, more often than not people(on here, in my experience) dismiss the speculation outright because they assume the speculator has some sort of ulterior motive against Muslims in general.

And it's very hard to make this point without stirring the the actual anti-Muslim brigade who think you're on their side.

Case in point was a video I made on YouTube in response to someone claiming to be a Muslim who got very upset about a joke on Have I Got News For You. I pointed out his mistake but made it very clear I knew he was in a minority of Muslims and that only a few would have been (mistakenly) annoyed, plus I made a note to the BNP lot etc. that I was *not* on their side. It still brought out such people who made comments about Islam that I won't have to detail to you.

Consider a hypothetical but very similar situation:

Someone posts on here that they gave their nephew ""To kill a mockingbird"" to read, but a teacher at school took it off him and said it was inappropriate and offensive. OP doesn't know why but the *only* thing he can think is that it's because there is racism and racial violence in the book, and it must be because there are a large number of black kids in the school.

Now, ignoring that TKaMB is National Curriculum literature (or was), while I can believe the odd person might say ""That's quite an assumption"" (again even though OP says ""It's the only thing I can think of""), would you also think that someone would say 

&gt; I strongly suggest you delete this thread and talk to the school.

It seems a little over zealous and I question it for the details above.

In effect Osborne is betting that the economy is going to get worse, not better. Branson is betting the opposite; that the banks will recover their value so his deal hasn't been a loss-maker.

There's no doubt that we've made a loss on Northern Rock, I'm not disputing it, but that loss was incurred the moment we bailed it out, not in the act of selling.

In theory, yes.  But in practice, no.

Our politicians are democratically elected and are supposed to represent the views of their constituents. However, the party whip ensures that they actually vote along party lines (except when they're given a free vote on things that the ruling party doesn't care one way or the other about).  So the reality is that the PM and his cabinet are the ones making the decisions and the rest of us have little or no say in the matter.  The best we can hope to do is remove the ruling party from power at the next election.  That's the only real difference between what we have and a dictatorship.

I start off with the requirement specification developed in association with the client \ customer . I then develop an engineering implementation specification - not a programming specification - and definitely not things like UML . Each specification has a 1:1 relationship with the previous specification . The implementation has a 1:1 relationship with the implementation specification . The testing specification , on the other side , has a 1:1 relationship with the implementation . Each leads into each other and each follows on from the other. All are physical in their nature - engineering is physical .

I am concerned with how best to put projects together . I look at things such as componentisation , reusablilty , business concerns in the engineering , speed of operation , software structures , memory usage , communication methods , operational methods , the various ways of putting the projects together . This is a whole new level way above just programming . Most programmers just don't have a clue about software engineering . Given that I am also an embedded software engineer I also need a good understanding of the hardware .

Unfortunately, mega trends (boomer population retiring, globalisation of labour) mean that growth wont arrive.  This means the only way out of debt is default or inflation.

Returning to the OP, what he did say was that the only reasons he could think of were religious ones, and claimed (but then retracted) that it was banned in Arab countries around the world. The fact is that it is a book that was also banned in the USSR, and apparently also in schools in Florida, USA, something I found on the first page of search results. 

I realised even as I wrote it that someone might take the 'delete it' comment in the way I think you have. The thought that was going through my head was 'a lie will go round the world while truth is pulling its boots on'. (Note that I am not calling the OP a liar). These are difficult times, with the far right/anti muslim types on the rise and willing to use whatever ammunition they can. Even mainstream newspapers have carried stories which further anti-muslim sentiments, but which have proven false when properly researched. I therefore think it is justified to suggest that speculation should be put on hold until the facts have been established. And that is all it was, a suggestion. 

So in short, I do not want to silence criticism of Islam, muslims etc, but I think unfounded speculation is something we should not support. If he gets some evidence, that is fine.

I'm just pointing out the fact that people seem to think a lack of referendums means we don't live in a democracy.

I can't say I wasn't disappointed with the results for AV, but at the same time I'm sure it's something that could've been voted in parliament and would have got a similar result. My main fault with referendums are people are never well informed on both sides of the argument. I believe some group ran the campaign saying that if AV went through the BNP would get more seats, but the BNP were very against AV because it would mean they'd lose seats.

Of course,  they did not explain where  the  cuts would  fall.  Labour’s  plan  involved 
– slightly –  less reliance on public spending cuts relative to tax increases as a way of cutting the deicit, but in the short term the government’s VAT increase to 20 per cent has meant a  relatively  greater  reliance  on  tax  (a  Labour  government was planning a VAT increase in any event). The Labour cuts involved somewhat deeper reductions  in capital, relative to current, spending. Labour’s cuts were also ‘front end loaded’ so they were not greatly different from this government’s in 2011/12. The government’s  cuts  involve  a  fairly flat profile with no reductions in health (which has real growth), schools and foreign aid, and no cash reductions in science. **The Labour plan also assumed 3 per cent economic growth after 2011/12 though the origins of this growth were never explained**, and we  now  know  that  those  growth  forecasts were  politically manipulated,  whereas  the  government’s  more  modest growth  assumptions  were  based  on  the  analysis  of  the

People don't disagree with you because either they or you are more informed.  Sometimes they just disagree.  The balance, the weight of evidence, the savings, the gains for staying part of the EEA but leaving the EU is compelling.  Makes no difference, people are told it and they still support being part of the EU because of some romanticised imagery they hold for it.  I didn't read it in the Mail.  I didn't read it in the Telegraph.  You can sit down with some figures, a little world experience, and work it out.  You can do your own study and the results are always the same but some people still like the idea of the EU.  Fair enough.

As for the referendum notion most people just recognise that from time to time a single issue arises that has such importance and significance that it transcends party politics, something that calls for a strong mandate and that's what referendums can do.

If somebody wants to read tat in the UK and limit their entire world view to that tat they can do but getting balance and contrast in the UK isn't a problem unless you're deaf and blind.  What you're really suggesting is that those who run parts of the media *may* be able to sway people for their own self-interests, so on that understanding there should be no referendum so self-interest groups definitely *will* make the decision that best suits them.

Even an uninformed referendum of the idiot masses is preferential to private self-interests, no voice; no consultation.

Having said that the country knocked it out of the park and got it completely right with the AV referendum.  Yes, again, there were romantic fools being dishonest to themselves but even the AV supporters couldn't cobble a campaign together.  When Labour proposed it in the run up to the election Clegg himself called it a miserable compromise and then after the coalition he was left practically running the campaign.  Labour had a decade to do it so they didn't want it and the Conservatives knew they're the popular polarisers so they didn't want it.

I hear them say they are planning on having a discussion in the tents and a vote on what policies to adopt and I am incredulous. The problems of markets, capitalism and globalisation has been wrestled with for decades and more by the best minds and it remains a unsolved. I don't see how it will be sorted by some students in tent in a couple of hours.

They may need some time to work on that.

As for the bankers I think they have shown themselves to be guilty of incompetence, greed and actual crimes (Not all but a large group of the financiers, dealers and banking chiefs). Thats probably not a rare opinion even among the educated these days.

Recent years have shown a catalogue of systemic banking fraudulent and malpractice. Do I need to list all these? UBS for example the bank here being occupied has recently been involved in the a vast US tax evasion scheme. A crime for which it paid a fine but no one is arrested. The whistleblower is now in jail for releasing private tax secrets.

For the UK to have gone through market liberalisation to face out sourcing, in sourcing, decline in heavy industries and working conditions is one thing. The country may accept these as the realities of market globalisation.

To face the enormous wages paid to those at the top of the financial markets and be told this is because they are so profitable that this is the reality of the market is still in keeping with the market theory.

But for then the entire country to be forced to bail out the banks due to their failure is not just an annoying necessity but a dangerous political situation.

If you are looking for someone involved in banking that both asked to ""smash the state"" and then was bailed out I would point to Matt Ridley.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Ridley

An aristocrat, libertarian, science writer. He's an interesting person and has written well on other people's science and he appears in Reason TV videos. He claimed in 2006 that  ""Government is the problem not the solution""

&gt; In every age and at every time there have been people who say we need more regulation, more government. Sometimes, they say we need it to protect exchange from corruption, to set the standards and police the rules, in which case they have a point, though often they exaggerate it...
... The dangerous idea we all need to learn is that the more we limit the growth of government, the better off we will all be.""

He was also non-executive chairman of Northern Rock from 2004 to 2007, earning £300,000 a year. The very bank that took reckless lending to the extreme. 

The bank was of course bailed by the government. Its executives received large pay offs in the subsequent deal. I really don't know where Ridley finds the chutzpah to still claim the state is the problem is gob smacking.

The last 30 years has seen a general view in financial circles that all deregulation is good. The banking system today is supported by the state with an implied guarantee and quantative easing. A situation that was caused largely by their disregard for rules, even self imposed rules.

The next stage of the crisis is about to unfold. We may not be as lucky as 2008 when we could afford to bail out the banks.",0,1321733412,null,0,false,0,c314w9j,t3_mgt5l,t1_c314w9j,t1_c310lv4,1428180454,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Finally. It isn't correct though. The public sector is more than capable of producing wealth because wealth is not the same as profit. In our economy the state does many things that add to GDP. They educate and train people, they stop buildings burning down, they protect the population from crime, etc etc. Those things aren't worthless to the economy, and without them we would all be less wealthy. I'd even say that if those things were done by the private sector we would be less wealthy, because most are natural monopolies.

There have been many countries over the years that have gone even further, with state run companies or entire state run industries, to varying degrees of success. Most have failed, but that was not because they were incapable of producing wealth, but because there was little incentive to be productive.

I havent got my notes to hand asi  have a new laptop and all my research is on my other hard drive, but i think we won 2-1 about 10 times last seaosn out of 38 games and the season before that was the same and the season before that was about 7.  The average bet for us to win a premiership game 2-1 is around 8/1.  Obviously agaisnt the top four its going to be alot higher , there is a few teams we play agaisnt that the odds shorten to about 5/1 or 6/1.  Anyway be be stupid because i wish i did this now. I said to my friend im going to put on 25 pound on every game this seaosn for us to win 2-1. Theres 38 games in a season so 25 x 38 = 950 punds staking.  So to break even at the average of betting of a 2-1 win being 8-1 you would only need it to come in 5 times for yourself to break even, well you would get alittle bit of profit from five times with those odds. Anyway we have already won 2-1 three times in the prem this year,  it could of been 5 only for Newcastle to score at the end making it 2-2 in that game and then wen we beat bolton 3-1 wen defoe scored last kick of the game. ANyway i wish i stuck to my plan now and carried out the bet.

Say you moved to Hull and got a job paying £15k a year - a whole £9000 less than you get now. Take home pay is just over £1046 a month. There are seven pages of 3 bedroomed houses to buy in Hull on Rightmove for under £50k, the cheapest being £27k. A mortgage for that would be £40 a week. So after you've paid out your mortgage every month, you have about £880 a month left to pay the bills, buy food and live - all on less than 2/3 of the salary you earn now. 

Where you are now, after you've paid your rent do you have £880 a month to live on? Unless your rent is less than £650 a month, the answer is no and you'd be better off moving to Hull and taking a £9000 pay cut.

People are obsessed with the top line, see they can move to London, get a pay increase of several grand or more, don't do the maths and move lock stock and barrel to London or nearby. That is why London has a population density nearly 10 times that of my county and that the prices of average accommodation is several times more. Yet the wages being paid in London for similar jobs are only about 1/3 higher, and certainly not enough to give the same left over to live on. It doesn't add up, does it?

true,I2ain,smith,Smith,"I understand some of your comments and questions on the episodes. Some things are a bit cryptic, and others are left open ended. 

However, I think I might be able to help in a few spots. The large gap of time in Day of the Moon, as well as having to go out of the way and build a prison in Area 51, is purely to confuse/escape the Silence (or so I think). It seemed as though it was a large ploy to seemingly remove the Doctor (and everyone else) from the Silence's grasp, making them assume that he was captive and no longer a threat to their current plans. 

The whole setup with the prison and showing Canton act as a double agent created the story that the US government was going after the Doctor, therefore preventing him from doing anything to the Silence. Part of the reason why I think this works is that the full involvement of the Silence in the Doctor's future is not known at this point, so it's not about preventing his death, but simply fighting against them.

Let's Kill Hitler was a rather bizarre episode, especially with it's immediate misdirection (Hitler being such a small part and being shoved away almost instantly). I think the whimsy that comes with the reveal of River Song as Amy's daughter helps remove the hubub about protecting the baby. It is no longer necessary to track her down, because, like the doctor said in The Impossible Astronaut, she'll find them. I think what it comes down to is finding her at the right time at this point, as changing her past would change who she is for the Doctor.

I do agree that it is strange that she MUST be in the suit, since the suit can act on its own, but I suppose that just goes along with her sole purpose being to kill the Doctor. However, I don't think it's that crazy that time goes all haywire when River goes against a static event in time. The events try to rectify themselves, and when she fights against it, everything just goes crazy. It isn't explained how she can do it, but I suppose that's left to imagination.

Oh, I did want to say that getting rid of River's regeneration ability was kind of necessary, though. They kind of walled themselves in with this one because we already saw River die (and she didn't regenerate) and we have seen her between her regeneration in Let's Kill Hitler and Silence in the Library, meaning that she has never again changed appearance. Given that we've seen her future, it's impossible to have her do timelord-y things without revealing that she is part timelord prematurely.


As far as the open ended stuff from Season 5, I totally agree. There has been no closure on that front. I will say that I don't entirely mind it, though, as it allows the Silence to return in Season 7. They are such good enemies, and I personally think they make for good episodes. I think perhaps having a two part finale in Season 6 would have been a good decision, as well, but I'm not complaining.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"I don't mind the thing about the Doctor letting himself out. See there are two kinds of time travel we see in Doctor Who. What I believe is that the Doctor got himself out of the Pandorica a different way, but we didn't see it. Because right after he did so, he gave Rory the sonic to get him out in the first place. Thus, the original escape gets wiped from time, so to speak, and is replaced by the Rory-with-the-sonic version.

The other kind of time travel is where we actually see the original version of something that is later written over and never happens. Like Last of the Timelords.

Actually there's a third kind. Where you see time currently changing before your eyes- A Christmas Carol as Sardick's memories are rewritten.

Time is relative. When you try and portray time in a show with an audience who can only view time as linear, you're going to get multiple perspectives. Same with language translation.

I didn't care for the big reveal in AGMGTW either, it felt more like a setup for LKH. LKH I did like even if there was some last-minute write-ins.

The Silence poke her brain to make her a killing machine and then plant her with her parents to wait for when they first meet the Doctor- so she can kill him.


But good point on why the spacesuit needed an operator. I think the Silence were going to originally going to put River underwater to sneak up on the Doctor (as plan B since the poison lipstick failed). Thus she needs the suit to live. They know they carry out this plan because they know about the fixed point. *BUT* then she turns on them. They still need to adhere to the fixed point so they put her in the suit anyways.

The fixed point is River killing the Tesselecta Doctor. River can't stop time, she broke it. And she wasn't supposed to do that. I mean, in fairness, time pretty much blew up because she did that.

Total point on who blew up the TARDIS. We can either assume it was the Silence, or hope Moffat will explain in future.

River grew up with Rory and Amy BECAUSE the doctor saved her as a kid and presumably hid her. Or he saved her and the Silence left her there to one day meet the doctor. As for the regeneration thing, I am pretty sure the doctor mentions something about a baby being conceived in the tardis would be....unique. So thats where the regeneration came from. 

I am still hoping saving baby river will be a part of season 7 rather than just having to assume it happened off screen though.

It had several  good, even great, ideas, such as the Silence creatures, the Doctor dying and River being Amy and Rory's daughter.

However, there were many problems with the execution of those ideas.  The whole 'The Silence being a religious organization trying to kill the Doctor' was stupid, and the organization really ruined the incredible monsters and made a shitty villain.  

Everything in Let's Kill Hitler was shit, really.  

The Mels thing was completely unnecessary, and River's first attempt to kill the Doctor was partly unnecessary, but I guess they needed a way to explain how her brainwashing was broken and how she lost her regenerations.  But the brainwashing was unnecessary in the first place since the space suit made her kill him, also a stupid idea.

It was really a case of too many good ideas, and therefore too much stupid shit had to be done to get them to fit together.  I hope Moffat will back up a bit next season.  Cut down on the story arc, and pick one good idea and focus on it.  This series just had way too much going on: the Doctor's death, River's origins and past, a new villainous organization, Amy and Rory's characterization, and hints of the Doctor's future.

Ok. So here's my rant for this episode.

1) This episode was not good for me. I spent the entire episode yelling at the TV, mainly at Leon. I don't care how powerful of an enchantment you are under, you DO NOT ever never ever tell Merlin that he's just a servant. Bad Leon!

2) The writers ended the show without having the Knights apologize to Merlin! WTF! They all owe him the biggest apology ever because they were complete and total assholes. Between this episode and Aithusa the knights deserve to be bitch slapped. Especially Gwaine, Mr 'I hate nobility and will never be mean to Merlin just because I'm a knight now'. I love Gwaine. He's my favorite knight, but so far this season I want to punch him.

3) Agravine, why can you never be good at being annoying when it would be useful! I mean, normally you being annoying is just annoying, but the one episode that you suck at being annoying in is the one episode where it would have been good. Gwen almost found out and since I hate you, I'm blaming you Agravine.

4) Leon and Gwaine fighting...XD

So this episode was awesome because we get to see the knights more, but it sucks because the knights were being asshole the entire time. Between this episode and the last episode, I'm so pissed. Gwaine and Gwen should both totally know about Merlin's magic now but nooooo. Agravine has to fail and Gwaine has to be the most oblivious moron on the planet!

Think about it like this: Eccelston's run has some pretty dumb episodes, but overall he is a great actor and there are definitely some good storylines going on in between the bad. He lasts for about 12 or so episodes, then Tennant takes over the role. Tennant has a few corny to awkward episodes, but from this point on, everything will only get better.
