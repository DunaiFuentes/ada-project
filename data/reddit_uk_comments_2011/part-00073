Tempted to say 'citation needed'. It has certainly been asserted loudly and frequently and for long enough for everyone to believe that it is true. But is it worse than the private sector?

Of course in a huge public organisation statistically there will be many examples of inefficiencies to plaster across the press, but similar inefficiencies in a big private organisation are less likely to be uncovered and there is less political motivation to do so.

true,talking_to_myself,uk,United Kingdom,"Benefits allow people to survive, but that's about it. 

Possibly, in the UK, if you have children you might be a little better off on benefits. But that's because child care is expensive because living is expensive and the paid child-carers need to survive too. Working when you have children is like working for two people- you and the child carer. Few places pay that much for entry level jobs. This is true unless the child care is subsidised by the government, which in turn costs the tax payer more or less the same as you staying home and looking after your own kids whilst on benefits. This must have been worked out by someone in some government department somewhere in the last ten years and this situation is what they chose.

Forget kids; 30 hours a week for 60 quid = £2/hour.  And perhaps they pay your rent on top of that, so, say an extra £100 per week = £160p/w. This is something equivalent to earning £5.50 per hour before tax. (£100p/w btw is going straight to your landlord, but remember *you* are the benefit scrounger although if he wants to increase *his* income he just puts up your rent).  £160 p/w doesn't sound too bad an income for doing not much, but although I don't know you I'm willing to bet you earn more at the moment. The extra time off you had per week in this case how would you spend it? Would you like to meet your friends for drinks? Forget it. How would you pay your bills... food, heating, mobile contract, *internet*, or the random shit you buy on ebay? You would spend your time desperately trying to find a job which paid you more (because there's much less chance of working any cash in hand now and selling drugs in the evenings doesn't appeal). In the mean time, this 'community work' you do could be just about *anything* the local council can't convince any other human being to do for minimum wage (reducing the chance of finding a real paid local job in the process). You will have no choice other than do this or be homeless, and if there are no other jobs in your town...

If you quit your job to do this instead, know that if you wanted to quit *this* you would be living on the streets within a few weeks because all your benefits would be stopped.

Most use of force laws are ""any person powers"" so to speak. I don't know exactly being at the bottom of the food chain but they are in a number of ARVs (armed response vehicles) and they available to TSG AFOs (authorised firearms officers). The idea of having them in ARVs is that they can have a non lethal option alongside the use of firearms. TASER is not always appropriate. The subject is to far away so it won't reach, they're likely to unaffected by it for whatever reason, public order situation also renders the TASER pointless. So it would only be a case of getting an ARV to the scene and start using them.

Problem is even very exclusive advisor's (who will only take clients with significant amounts of cash to invest) are in my experience pretty poor at their jobs.

Portfolio theory suggests that you don't care too much about the risk of any asset, what you need to care about is the average return and the correlation. However every advisor I've seen plans shit out like this:

How much risk do you want to take?! 
O.K. you want W bonds, X 'safe' funds, Y risky funds and Z HEDGE funds.  (Hedge funds are super exciting by the way!!) 

They then adjust W, X, Y and Z based upon your 'risk level'. 

Which is a totally ass backward way to do it, portfolio theory tells you that it doesn't matter what 'risk level' your assets are in half as much as how big the corrolation is. 

If you go into UK Gov bonds and BP bonds and invest in Shell and a bunch of small oil service companies and then a bunch of emerging market industries reliant on oil and a hedge fund which does something in the same market. Even the slightest upset in that market is going to cause you massive pain.

And they will ALL charge you money for something which is essentially freely available, as John Kay points out in the long and the short of it.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;[citation needed]. That's a thoroughly unbelievable number. It also ignores the fact that many cluster bombs are designed to operate in this way to deny areas to your enemy for extended periods.

Does it matter if you believe it or not? Testing to military standards is pretty damned rigorous; a very long and expensive process. If bomblets are failing to explode, the most obvious reason is that they've out of their recomended shelf life (yes, munitions have a 'best before' date), not that the weapons are intrinsically unreliable.

&gt;That's not what happened. The US choose to wage war in Libya for it's own interests. There was no expectation of anything and any public support for the intervention was built on a pack of lies that has subsequently been proven as such.

What? The invervention was built on protecting the civilian population against a nutcase who was in fact dropping cluster munitions on peoples houses (something proven by the New York Times). Isn't that the point of this little debate?

&gt;NATO bombed the shit out of population centres.

NATO bombed the shit out of the loyalist forces, many of which were deliberately camping out in civilian centres for human shields. NATO went to great lengths to protect cilvian life. Of the 26,089 sorties conducted, 9,618 were strike sorties. Of the link you provided, there were 6 incidences of civilian deaths as a result of NATO bombing missions. Thats around 0.06% of missions resulting in civilian casulties, and although any one death is clearly a tragedy, I wonder what you belive a reasonable percentage would be?

&gt;No such thing, the whole ""smart bomb"" meme is nothing more than propaganda to lessen concerns about our military habits. A modern bomb may be able to hit a designated target with a reasonable expectation of accuracy, but this is irreverent given our lack of discretion in our target choice as well as continuous intelligence failures. Remember, we'll take out an entire apartment building to kill one guy who is rumoured to be in the restaurant below.

A weapon is only as smart as the person using it; that's been true since the dawn of war. But in what way does this make cluster munitions different from any other weapon?",0,1320922528,null,0,false,0,c2yo83g,t3_m60ml,t1_c2yo83g,t1_c2yhrie,1427858434,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I ordered a rubber cover for my HTC a year ago or so, it never turned up and I got into a running battle with the supplier. They said it had been delivered and I had my address wrong, I knew it hadn't and the address on my Amazon account was plainly correct as I get a lot of stuff sent from Amazon. After toing and froing for a couple of weeks and them flatly refusing to send out a replacement I put a simple comment on their product page with one star ( you can't give no stars for some reason) : Don't order from this company, they don't deliver. 

They went absolutely fucking ballistic at me.  It became a case of: Send  me the product and I'll remove the comment vs Remove the comment or face court action. I was like: What, just send me the fucking product?

So I mentioned it to my lawyer for shits and giggles ( FTR I work in the music industry, the guy I use is pretty heavyweight and I had a bit of ongoing business with him anyway so it didn't cost me ) He sent them a simple letter basically saying in not so many words: If you really want to do this, go right ahead, or you could just send my client what he ordered.

Edit : That fool Watson has just accused Murdoch of being a mafia boss running a criminal empire. What a fucking idiot. The rest of the room sighed at him as he did it and shook their heads.

Edit : Actually it doesn't seem pointless. I'm shocked, in all honesty, but I don't believe James Murdoch belongs in jail. I originally couldn't envisage him not being knee deep in the phone hacking cover up. While it's clear he pragmatically authorised a large payment to stop something going to court which would end up costing, he believed around the same and damage reputation I don't see why that is a terrible thing. I can't believe I'm technically now on the side of James Murdoch, perhaps it's due to the inept bludgeoning of our great and good MPs.

Edit : And now Davies is paraphrasing Murdoch and trying to change the meaning, so that he can argue against the new altered meaning. This is amateur. :(

Edit : Tom Watson looks regretful (I may be imagining it!). Perhaps he realises the gravity of his ridiculous outburst.

Edit : It continues to get worse.. the last MP asked him a ""Have you stopped beating your wife"" question. Along the lines of ""Given your lack of questions which were screaming to be asked are you incompetent"".

Now of course the demand is high again and you've got the situation where there are 100s of people on a waiting list and not enough free plots. Most of them are now subdividing plots when they become free, and becoming stricter on kicking people off.

Agreed though, the demand for allotments doesn't look like its going to drop in the short-term and some of the councils should be creating more plots - particularly in the urban areas where many people don't have gardens.

Well there is that, but you also have to think how many of them were written with the know that the chances of them being implied were remote. I know it sounds odd to put a manifesto together, with policies you know wont get in, but given that you have to pay lip service to all factions of the party, it is possible some were written as appeasements. That could be said for LD or Tory.  Sounds a bit whimsical I know but I always consider every angle. Also there will be some similarities with any manifestos, simply because it is the same country facing the same problems that need tackiling, and the solutions to those may be similar. 
I have even found myself agreeing with some of the Tory policies ( shock horror, it stuck in my throat!) yet I am a very left lefty.

I suspect it might be a combination of both, but in general cargo shipments to the UK from Asia are noticeably more expensive than shipping to the USA.

Air fright isn't that much worse, but sea shipments are a lot cheaper across the Pacific to California then rail fright across the USA than sea shipments to the UK via Singapore, Suez and English Channel -- all three being amongst the most expensive shipping lanes in the world.

Retailers do seem to have higher costs in the UK per outlet, although I haven't done any detailed analysis and my view is based on overviews of telecoms retailers in both countries.

Obviously if your base costs are higher, then even the same profit percentage applied at the end retailer in the UK and USA will result in a higher cash amount being added in the UK.

true,lightsaberon,null,null,"&gt;But the new system essentially is a progressive tax; the more you earn, the more you pay back. In fact, it's a damn sight more progressive than having everyone, even the very poorest people, pay for middle class degrees.

Let me give you a hypothetical example of how unfair this is.  Graduate A gets a sociology degree, £50k in loans, becomes a charity worker and earns average of £22k.  Graduate B gets a law degree, £50k in loans, becomes a lawyer and earns average of £200k.  Sure, the lawyer will pay more, but obviously the charity worker will be hit harder.  A millionaire paying 40% in taxes isn't hit as hard as someone earning £20k and paying 40% in taxes.  It's obviously not as bad as that, but helps to highlight the point.  It would be fairer if university fees were paid through progressive taxes as a whole.  Why should a millionaire not pay for university education, of people he benefits from, because he didn't get a degree?

Let's take another hypothetical.  Graduate A has rich parents, they pay the £50k fees off immediately.  Graduate B is not poor enough to waive the loans, he is just above the limit.  B ends up paying more for his degree over time.  This is very unfair.

I have a dog, and when she would vomit or have diarrhea, at first we would take her to the vet every time. 50 or 100 dollars later, they said she probably just ate something that upset her stomach, gave her a can of what was basically boiled chicken and rice, and said not to worry so much. 

Now, unless she seems really violently ill or is acting strange, we don't bother with the vet and just give her food for an upset dog stomach. 

I hear parents tell stories about how with their first kid, they take them to the doctor or ER every time the kid seems even mildly ill, but then they ""learn"" and on the second kid they don't freak out so much about minor things. 

This is one of those stories that makes my apprehension skyrocket, because it only confirmed in my mind that you shouldn't ignore the small things....but then depending on your insurance and such, it's really not financially feasible to go to the doctor every week when your kid is just a little stuffy.

The physical location (campus size) is reasonably large. Technically it could take as much as 20 minutes to walk from one end to the other but you tend to be roughly focused in a 5-10 minute radius. Student body is somewhere slightly below 20k, last I checked.

The University is located pretty much in City Centre, which is pretty comfortable for a night-time stroll (if you're really into that sort of thing).

I don't know the figures, but that without the support of a lot of students, the Lib Dems would have won even fewer seats. The 'no tuition fees' campaign was one of their most high profile campaigns, with Clegg and others doing big photoshoots signing the pledge. I would say that a lot of students who may otherwise have voted labour, or may not have voted at all, instead voted for the LibDems.

I can understand that political realities meant that this had to be dropped - but they handled it in such a crap, wishy-washy way, that it didn't look good. If I was a full time LibDem supporter, from before the election, then I would be delighted with the outcome, as they've got proportionally  more power in government than they deserve from their seats. But if I'd voted for LibDem because of their student promise, as I'm sure a lot of people did (I personally didn't), I think I would feel justifiably angry.

I dont hate Nick Clegg at all, but I think this coalition has shown him and his party up, and in the long run will turn a lot of people away from them.

This is very much besides the point. The parties have been given the right to form a government based on the votes of the people. If they have made pledges that cannot be fitted into a coalition deal then they have no right to form a government. 


This was not a manifesto promise. This was a personal pledge by each Lib Dem to his electorate. Every lib dem who breaks that pledge has personally lied to receive votes.  


A Manifesto promise is based on a party winning. It makes perfect sense that such promises can only be a guide when forming coalition policies. The fact that we get any is a bonus. And to force the whole manifesto would be undemocratic.

&gt;A coalition is always going to result in things you wanted not making the cut. You must have known that when you voted.

Given we're discussing student fees in this particular thread - you're placing an awful lot of savvy on a demographic that are most likely voting for the first time, not necessarily turned on to politics and with no long term experience of how any of the political parties work. I'd go so far as to call the youngest voters naive as a result... believing the promise that *if this person is made Prime Minister, he and those who stand with him will not allow a tuition fee rise*. 

That man didn't win outright - but he and those alongside him who made personal pledges to fight a rise in tuition fees did *not* come through on that pledge. 

Consider the damage this has done for a whole generations faith in the current political system. 

Whether Clegg has done a good job with what he has at the moment is immaterial. For me and - dare I say it - a great deal of disillusion young folks like me; his word is mud. Why would I ever wish to see this man and his party in power, knowing that anything they say could be let go and glossed over so easily?

In fact the Lib-Dems got more votes during this election than they did in the last one, and they lost seats! How is that fair?

The problem is that politics is seen in this country as ""winning"" the election, and then one party gets absolute rule for 4 years. Which is utter bullshit, because if the vote swings the other way 4 years later they new party will try to change everything back, and we're back where we started. What we need to start doing is perceiving parliament as a place in which intelligent people work together, equally representing a cross-section of society, and work out compromises that all of us can live with. 

Unfortunately Clegg had to break some of his election promises, because he didn't win absolute power, and hung parliament necessitates compromise.

How so?

*While out of power, the Labour party set up a working group to examine electoral reform. The resulting Plant commission reported in 1993 and recommended the adoption of the supplementary vote, a system very similar to AV, for the Commons. Labour's 1997 manifesto committed the party to a referendum on the voting system for the Commons and to setting up an independent commission to recommend a proportional alternative to FPTP to be put in that referendum.*

*After winning the 1997 General Election, the new Labour government consequently set up the Jenkins Commission into electoral reform …  The commission reported in September 1998 and proposed the novel alternative vote top-up or AV+ system.*

I don't really see that AV diverged hugely from the consensus of the reform that's been discussed in the last decade or two. Is it perfect? No. But I think it was hoped it was reform that people could accept.  ",0,1320953519,null,0,false,0,c2yrxu9,t3_m7cer,t1_c2yrxu9,t1_c2yqne2,1427860175,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The students (or young people, if you like) got stung with it this time as their ""chosen one"" lied to them. 

Unfortunately this means a kind of majority rule that isn't necessarily healthy. The system will never ever work 100% effectively because each group will always have a particular interest at heart. 

Suppose I'm a young person - so right now I care about education and new jobs for graduates... ...then I'm a young parent - I want to know what the government is going to do for me in terms of child support, health care for my baby, housing etc... ...then I'm a rich businessman - I want my interests protected including not having to pay crippling taxes on my million-pound home and three cars... ...then I'm an old man and I care about my health care again, support for old people, pensions and so on. 

But unless the rich businessman is putting a teenager through University they probably won't care about Cleggs lies of late... or unless they have a father in a care home who can't afford the gas bill they won't care about pensions for the old. 

In short: People are self interested and selfish. 

And as long as we're governed by a system that represents the needs of the most influential or the target demographic - others may be left out. Perhaps I have a rather utopian view but it would be nice to think that everyone's needs could be considered equally without any one group paying the price to an ""unfair"" level.

true,chochazel,null,null,"&gt;You clearly do not understand economics, promoting pseudo-growth through the expansion of the public sector is only creating a fictional bubble of ""prosperity"".

No.  A person who is employed by the public sector will be able to spend their money in the rest of the economy just like anywhere else.  In no sense is this an illusory situation!  In economic terms it is not a bubble of prosperity.  It is just employment in another sector.  You may disagree with it in political terms, or think that those people could be better employed, and you have every right to that opinion, but there is no economic justification for saying that it is illusory or fictional!

I think you may be confusing growth based on the public sector and growth based on borrowing.  Growth based on borrowing certainly is capable of producing a fictional bubble of prosperity, but this is due to the fact it is built upon borrowed money, not specifically because that money has been borrowed by the public sector.  Money borrowed by the private sector would also create a fictional bubble of prosperity.  In fact, the private sector is far more likely to create fictional bubbles of prosperity based on borrowing, and this is exactly what was happening in the last decade, and it's what directly lead to the financial crisis at the end of the decade.  The borrowed money which sustained the housing bubble was not being borrowed by the public sector!

As for Labour, the story is again a bit more complicated.  They were running surpluses up until 2002 (the start of the war on terror), and small deficits up until the financial crisis in 2008.  Overall, [debt was at a lower level in 2008 than it was when they came to power in 1997.](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/downchart_ukgs.php?year=1990_2011&amp;state=UK&amp;view=1&amp;expand=&amp;units=p&amp;fy=2011&amp;chart=G0-total&amp;bar=0&amp;stack=1&amp;size=m&amp;color=c&amp;title=)

Debt was 41.92% of GDP when Labour came to power in 1997, which, contrary to what you say, was not significantly less than it was when the Conservatives came to power in 1979 (43.61%).  This in turn was lower than when Heath (previous Conservative government) left office in 1974 when it was 47.87%. In 2008 it was 36.25% 

The subsequent massive increase in debt which you correctly identified, all happened after the financial crisis.  Debt rose to 52.25% in 2010.  Historically, the increases correlate with economic failures and wars, rather than any particular political party.  

Debt continued to increase massively after the election, and will continue to increase in the next few years.

You might find this graph interesting:

http://www.tutor2u.net/blog/index.php/economics/comments/timetric-public-sector-employment

It shows that public sector employment was actually falling from 2005 to 2008, and then rose suddenly, largely because of the large number of banks transferred into state ownership.

* Introduce an Education Freedom Act banning politicians from getting involved in the day-to-day running of schools. Teachers are held back by constant government interference which distracts from teaching. We would cut the size of the central department of Children, Schools and Families, and focus its activities on a few strategic priorities. Local authorities will not run schools, but will have a central strategic role, including responsibility for oversight of school performance and fair admissions. They will be expected to intervene where school leadership or performance is weak.

* Give all schools the freedom to innovate. We will ensure a level playing field for admissions and funding and replace Academies with our own model of ‘Sponsor-Managed Schools’. These schools will be commissioned by and accountable to local authorities and not Whitehall, and would allow other appropriate providers, such as educational charities and parent groups, to be involved in delivering state-funded education.

* Reform the existing rigid national pay and conditions rules to give schools and colleges more freedom, including in offering financial and other incentives to attract and retain excellent teachers, while ensuring that all staff receive the minimum national pay award. opportunities at college and university

About the Doctor: I wasn't able to glean much from just the one episode, but I was a bit surprised at how he had no qualms with leading the Aztec woman on or helping Iztar (may not be spelled like that) win with the cactus.

Clegg had the option of giving Cameron confidence without entering coalition, allowing him to form a minority government. It's quite a common model and is used in Denmark amonst others. Cameron's policies would have to get through the house and the Lib Dems would not have been tied to collective responsibility, which would have given them far more bargaining power. Such a solution would not only have helped Clegg push the Lib Dem's agenda, it would have been more democratic, as all MPs could have supported both their party and their manifesto commitments.

Instead of this he took a ministerial role with all the perks this comes with, tied himself to supporting policies that went directly against his manifesto commitments and betrayed his party's agenda and his own supporters.

Lister wakes to find that millions of years have passed, his pet cat evolved into a bi-pedal cat species, with one last remaining, so named Cat, and his worst frenemy and bunk mate, Arnold Rimmer, has been turned into a Hologram in order to keep Lister from going insane.

The coalition agreement was very pro-Lib Dem considering the ratio of seats. But other elements in government seem to lean further towards the Tories than I would hope or expect.

For example, my MBP was £280 cheaper than in the UK and ram (8GB) was £24. However, your math for the Asus Transformer Whatever is slightly off. £500 is $800 (1.6) and includes 20% sales tax. Removing the sales tax (*5/6), the cost of the Asus is $666. I used to calculate import tax at 20% for my products coming in from China and taking another 20% off $666 is $555. So, the price difference is $50 but because our tradition in the UK is to actually tax sales and include that tax at the time of purchase, the cost is $300 different. If my import tax is wrong I'll happily update this.

* land is easier to get.

Like for example if I said ""It's a crime to do that"" (talking hypothetically here, so ""that"" could be anything). If I know it's a crime then I must already know what particular crime it is. For example it might be a crime of murder or a crime of theft etc. If I say it's a crime to do something but I don't actually know which crime it is then I must have been making it up because I didn't actually know if it is a crime or not because I don't know which crime it is. 

And it's the same with what you said. You said something was a fallacy and I asked you which fallacy it was. But it seems like you don't know what fallacy it was. Is it (for example) the fallacy of *""Argument from ignorance"" (appeal to ignorance, argumentum ad ignorantiam): assuming that a claim is true (or false) because it has not been proven false (true) or cannot be proven false (true)*, or is it another fallacy?

If you can't remember it's name, perhaps you can describe it instead. How exactly does this fallacy work?

Yes, I know of Mil-Spec. But 1% is still an insane number. The CBU-87 has an [official failure rate of 5%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBU-87_Combined_Effects_Munition) and an [actual failure rate in combat of around 10% depending on the type](http://www.landmineaction.org/resources/resource.asp?resID=1035).


&gt; If bomblets are failing to explode, the most obvious reason is that they've out of their recomended shelf life

Some are specifically designed not to explode and are used for area-denial purposes. Like landmines they now often have programmed shelf-lives, but like anything the system has reliability issues and even when it does work you still have packages of high explosives waiting for a JCB operator to find and set off. It's basically a modern form of ""salting the earth"".

&gt; The invervention was built on protecting the civilian population against a nutcase who was in fact dropping cluster munitions on peoples houses (something proven by the New York Times)

It has subsequently been proven to be false. There is no credible evidence whatsoever of any military use of weapons against civilians. 

The information provided to western media was carefully managed to gain public support. Besides the lies about ""viagra equipped rape squads"", here is a quick [timeline of what happened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2011_Libyan_civil_war_before_intervention):

* 15 February: protests broken up by police in scenes no more violent than have been seen in the US recently
* 16 February: protests turn into riots, government buildings are attacked and burned and six policemen are killed
* 17 February: the police (not military) fight back, killing many of the rioters
* 18 February: a pre-existing terrorist group with extensive ties to Al Qaeda uses the situation to take over a military base. All base personnel are executed. Meanwhile, the rebels lock a bunch of ""collaborators"" in a jail then burn down the building

From then it's basically a tale of the rebels capturing and looting towns followed by counter attacks from Gadaffi's forces. 

Quite different from the impression you had, right? International law allows any recognised government (dictatorship or not) the right to defend themselves against armed uprisings, which this absolutely was from almost the very beginning. NATO intervention was built entirely on the premise of protecting civilians, not inhuman rebel groups who are attacking and holding entire villages. The east of Libya where this all happened has always had issues with these terrorists, in fact just five years ago the west was helping Gadaffi crack down on some of them. The divisions are tribal and go back generations.

You know the rest, though the level to which NATO led the conflict was vastly understated. Basically we'd bomb the target to dust and the rebels would roll in with the TV cameras to mop up and get some good clips of them shooting empty buildings. 

Amnesty International investigated the claims that the military was used against peaceful demonstrators. [They could not substantiate a single claim](http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2011/06/481209.html), all of which incidentally came from the rebels themselves and were reported by our press without any fact-checking. The claims about rape being used against protesters as well as the use of mercenaries could not be substantiated. The rebels have been using this later claim as a ruse to allow them to torture and execute any black people they find, raping their victims wives and daughters. The fact is that they are racist and always have been. These are the people who are ""liberating"" Libya. Their rule will be worse than Gadaffi's, mark my words. Women's rights have already taken a pasting. 

Interestingly, a top CIA asset, [Khalifa_Belqasim_Haftar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalifa_Belqasim_Haftar) was flown from his home in Langley for the conflict. He was initially the unofficial rebel leader but later became the de-facto leader when [his forces executed Abdel Fattah Younes](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8669596/Libyan-rebel-leader-shot-dead-by-own-side.html).

Like Iraq, the war was built on lies. The truth may come out in the popular press eventually but I wouldn't hold your breath. 

Libya was a response to the changes in Egypt where we lost our stalwart ally dictator. We got involved to help ""mould"" the new government in Libya but were wrong-footed when it faltered and we had to ""intervene"" (i.e. ""take over""). They've already locked out Russia and China from Libya's oil markets and signed a whole load of new contracts with us. 

&gt; NATO bombed the shit out of the loyalist forces, many of which were deliberately camping out in civilian centres for human shields. 

If you believe that then I think I've just wasted my time. 

&gt; Of the link you provided, there were 6 incidences of civilian deaths as a result of NATO bombing missions. 

My god, that is not the total for the conflict!! The civilian casualties are in the thousands! We helped the rebels surround and bombard many towns for extended periods, exactly as we were accusing Gadaffi of!",0,1320967542,null,0,false,0,c2yu6zp,t3_m60ml,t1_c2yu6zp,t1_c2yo83g,1427861311,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Usually when people talk of a fallacy they mean unsound or incorrect *reasoning*. So for example ""the sky is green"" wouldn't be a fallacy, it would just be wrong; factually incorrect

Something like ""the sky is green because you are ugly"" would be a fallacy though, as the reasoning used to draw the conclusion is not logically sound. Another example of fallacious reasoning would be ""1+1=2 because my cat's breath smells like cat food"". So for a fallacy you need logically unsound reasoning or rhetorically unsound reasoning. You need something like *""I say A, therefore also B""* and for there to be no logical or reasonable connection between A and B.

So I think you probably just mean wrong or false rather than a fallacy. So your claim is that wut999 is wrong: his statement is false.

Can you explain what you mean by saying he is wrong. Why don't people have a right to burn a poppy? Do you mean they don't have a legal right to do so (and if so, can you say which law it breaks) or do you mean something else?

Similarly, I know for a fact that I have never said that burning puppies while shouting ISLAM IS DOMINATING is right, so asking me to explain why it's right doesn't seem warranted. 

You however, definitely did say that it's a fallacy (although it turned out you really meant it's a false statement) to say that people have a right to burn poppies. Like so...

* wut999: I think burning poppies is horrible, and it deeply offends me, but they still have a right to do it.

* You: That's a fallacy. It's a false statement to make. People did not fight in the war so that muslims could burn poppies and shit on our culture.

So, can you explain what you mean by saying he is wrong? Why don't people have a right to burn a poppy? Do you mean they don't have a legal right to do so (and if so, can you say which law it breaks) or do you mean something else?

Sadly for you, British civil society is a little more mixed than that. Furthermore I'm sure plenty of Muslims, especially those who's ancestors fought on behalf of or in alliance with Britain (not to mention Muslims currently serving in HM Forces), will be equally offended by the actions of IAC.

Sure what IAC is doing is tactless and offensive, the way to minimise offence is simply to limit the coverage of their protests. Sadly, creating hysteria about an immigrant nation and an erosion of ""British values"" better serves the purposes of our elites, so expect to see these muppets plastered all over the front of the Sun/Express/Mail etc. Now I could solve this by banning coverage of these fools [perhaps to avoid offending the larger public] but I bet the newspapers would be up in arms about defense of free speech then.

The problem is that is one group wants free speech, then all should have it. To ban groups like IAC is simply the thin end of the wedge.",0,1320977134,null,0,false,0,c2yvjbu,t3_m7imv,t1_c2yvjbu,t1_c2yvgnp,1427861973,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

We weren't quite sure to believe her or not but, being the nice people we were, gave her the benefit of the doubt and let her and the kid hang around.

And hang around they did.  Wouldn't leave the whole time we were there, just chatting to us and all.  She was nice enough; just a bit annoying.

All this being said, it did lead to one of the greatest moments I can remember when my friend started boking and her kid decided to choose that moment to start batin' him on the head.  Fucking hilarious to say the least.

""Studs"" aren't always good in bed. I like that there's depth and flaws to his character besides being the ""stud"" and I thought this past episode was good character development for him. I do agree with you about Rudy, and I think they could do some different things with his character. What you have to remember is that it's only two episodes into the season (yeah I know, that's 1/4 of the season already). I don't think the writers had time to write for Rudy specifically, so they just put him in Nathan's place for the time being. Hopefully, he'll get some character growth during the new season and if there's a season 4.

You see, in *Let's Kill Hitler*, River Song (or Mel) offhandedly mentions that ""the last time I [regenerated], I ended up a toddler"", explaining her age discrepancy... in a way.

You could pull some mumbo-jumbo out of your ass to cover up the fact that Melody and Amy grew up together despite the fact that even as a toddler, Melody would still be 20+ years older than Amy (born in 1989, Scotland) like prolonged Time Lord Agency (which holds about as much water as a teflon drain, if you take into account the fact that her and Amy not only grow up together, but *physically age* together also) but it still wouldn't cover the real mistake: How does a toddler get from some back alley in New York to Leadworth, where she would, presumably, gain a family and proceed to stalk her mother and father who (for reasons still unexplained) she recognizes as such.

true,serenityunlimited,null,null,"There have only been two episodes from this season so far so take this speculation with the grain of salt it deserves.

Every character has a new power (or is new to the show).  This means each character now has more aspects to who they are, giving more to explore.  

Misfits has six episodes per season/series; there are six main characters.

Episode one focused on Rudy.  Granted, this was partly to introduce him to the show, but it also contained a fair amount of exploration and development of his character, and how he was able to evolve by learning to cope with his powers.

Episode two focused on Curtis.  This explored a lot of his weakness in character and his shortcomings.  It also explored the difficulties that can arise with his power (both the physical/societal differences as well as the psychological side).  From this, Curtis learned to better understand his power, grow as a person in a substantial (and positive) way, and flesh/feel out a lot of the conflict that has been festering inside him.

Each episode had other plots within as well, but there was a dominant plot in each centered around a single character.  They may well continue this approach through the rest of the season, which allows them to continue overarching stories, as well as develop each character in a very personal basis.

Take Kelly, for instance.  She has a ""useless"" power (""Imma fookin' rocket scientist!), which is shown in the second episode to have some merits to it (when she fixes the car for Powertrader Man).  The creative powers behind Misfits aren't ones to do useless things - they might use it to show that people are sometimes helpless, but they don't dangle it there, untouched and unabused.  I suspect there will be a Kelly-centric episode which focuses on her and her relationship to her new power, whether it is understanding how to apply it in a more useful way, or change powers, or struggle against its lack of usefulness in the gang's situations.

That leaves three episodes, three characters.  I only saw a snippet from next week's preview, but it seemed to suggest Simon as a prominent plot.  That might be his episode, then the Kelly episode, then two more: an Alisha episode, and an episode for a grand finale where it all comes together.  

**tl;dr five episodes centered around each character, then a finale.  This was Curtis' turn**

Regarding your actual question and opinion however, I did enjoy the episode.  I didn't care much for Curtis up until that point, but this really developed his character in a way I found most interesting.  I like the other characters a lot, though, and would have liked to see more of them.

true,charlesdexterward,null,null,"No, the twenty year gap I'm referring to is between 1969 and 1989, and has yet to be addressed.

Okay, I'm going to examine this a little more closely:

-At the end of DOTM, Melody is in New York ""six months later"" after the events of the episode, so December 1969.

-The next time we see her in her chronology is the opening montage of LKH, in which she is hanging out with young Amelia, who has already met the Doctor. According to Wikipedia, Amelia met the Doctor in 1996 when she was seven. Assuming that this scene takes place that same year, we now have a 27 year gap between DOTM and the LKH opening.

-Just before Mels regenerates into River, she says ""The last time I did this I wound up a toddler in New York. Took me ages to find you two.""

From this, I can think of a few different explanations:

1. The DOTM Regeneration is the one she was talking about, and she somehow remained a child for 27 years before she started aging at a normal rate. Unlikely.

2. There is another incarnation between the DOTM Melody and Mels, which incidentally also regenerated in New York. Possible. She could have realized that it was 20 years prior to the birth of her parents and decided to regenerate into a child after they were born so she could befriend them. We already know from Romana I into Romana II that regeneration can be both voluntary and controlled.

3. The Silence found her in 1969 and plopped her off in Leadworth in the early 90's. Possible, but it would mean that she was lying when she said ""it took me ages to find you"" and also that the Silence have time travel capabilities.

4. Steven Moffat just didn't think it through that precisely. Possible. If he had really put that much thought into River's back story prior to this season surely there would have at least been mention of Mels, if not an appearance.

5. Steven Moffat HAS thought it through, very throughly in fact, and something of importance happened during this period that will come back to be important later. Also possible.

Modric was valued at about 40m this last summer, and he's a player in his peak years coming off a full season of stellar play.  A year ago 35 mil was enough for David Villa, a 25 goal a season striker (I know his form's been mediocre, but at the time it was an eminently fair price).

Whilst that is a useful utility, it does not allow you to compare what it used to be like and it majors on the total amount repayable rather than what the month to month cost is. 

I agree that generally with debt you should look at the total amount payable, however with SLD there is that write off clause that effectively nullifies the risk of spiralling debt due to interest payments. 

I honestly think the Lib Dems biggest blunder on student loans was not calling it a graduate tax. Debt has far to many negative connotations (especially at the moment).

I keep hearing this, but I'd like to see some proof of this.

I recently had a 1.5 year old kitchen appliance fail and tried to take it back to Robert Dyas. I was told that it was out of warranty. I cited the Sale of Goods act and the fact that it should be guaranteed for a reasonable life span. But here's how it works...

Once a product is over 6 months old, it's then up to you to prove that the fault is a manufacturing defect. This means that you have to go and find a reputable repair company to inspect the item. They then have to write a letter stating that in their qualified opinion, the fault is a manufacturing defect. 

Once you've got that, depending on the value of the item, you either have to take them to small claims court (which in the case of Dyas, I could) or get a solicitor and take them to proper court. You can claim for the cost of the item and the direct costs that you incurred (so not the time you spent getting your case together). 

I'd love to see some real backing for this '6 year warranty' myth, given what I've just been through.",0,1321011869,null,0,false,0,c2yymli,t3_m7fux,t1_c2yymli,t1_c2yptr9,1427863432,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Taking your literal meaning of ""we"" to personally include you, then you've made some strange statements in the past.

Another way to look at it too is that if your friend goes travelling and does F all for two years and you bust a gut getting a decent job then you are the sucker paying their interest payments.

[This](http://www.wak-tt.com/tt/2yearwarranty1.htm) prepared legal advice covers the minimum standards in plainer English.  This is not something they can wriggle out of, and if they try then it's a matter for trading standards.  If you're having trouble with mouth breathers in store don't waste your time, just write to head office quoting the appropriate legislation, and saying if they are not prepared to honour the law you will take them to the small claims court, citing both the EU part and the SOGA.  Be sure to mention that you have tried in store and left disappointed, as if you do go to the small claims court this will count in your favour.  Note in the letter that further costs would be incurred should further action be required.  Keep to the facts, no emotion at this stage.  If they don't comply, send a copy of all correspondence to trading standards and file in the small claims court and start recording any hours put towards this as you can charge for those as well.

The 6 year thing isn't a myth, it's intended to prevent abuse by the customer and third party errors being covered by the manufacturer.  For example if a dishwasher is meant to deal with plates that have been rinsed of large food items and you don't then it can jam up.  If an electrician installs a hob on top of it and it overheats parts of it leading to electrical failure, this is also not the manufacturers fault.  I'm assuming in your case you feel that this is a fault where the manufacturer should be considered responsible.

Which by the sounds of it you were not. He could have been considered to have been in charge of the vehicle (although not driving) because he had ready access to the brakes and steering. Interestingly the law holds that the engine does not have to be switched on for you to be considered driving. I can remember a specific case with a guy who was disqualified from driving, who sat astride his motorcycle and then propelled it down the road using his feet against the ground. As he was able to both steer and brake the machine he was found guilty of driving whilst disqualified, even though the engine was not switched on. I can't remember the name of the case off the top of my head though. I digress, you could also be in charge of the vehicle if for example you put the keys in the ignition and turned the headlights on. Also you have to be on a road or other public place. Some people have already said ""But Tesco is private property, so how does that work?"" Tesco's car park is indeed privately owned by them, however for the purposes of the road traffic act a road or other public place is one which the public (or a section there of) have ready access to. Obviously Tesco car park meets that definition. When he was found the officers would have considered him to be in charge rather than driving. He was charged with (and convicted of) failing to supply a specimen for analysis. This happens when someone thinks they'll be clever and not do the test. Or try and cheat it by blowing around it or what ever.

Season 2: Another tie: The Dalek Invasion of Earth and the Time Meddler

Season 3: Lots of lost episodes, some gems among them, but gotta go with the Celestial Toymaker

Season 4: Again, lots of missing. Three way tie (none of them complete stories :( ): Tenth Planet, Power of the Daleks, Evil of the Daleks (I do have a thing for 1960s Dalek stories, yes.)

Season 5: Tomb of the Cybermen, hands down, but probably because it's actually complete. Ice Warriors and Fury from the Deep are close seconds, maybe even better stories, but recons are a pain to watch, imo.

Season 6: hands down the War Games. Honorable mention (first Troughton story I ever saw) goes to Seeds of Death.

Season 7: (Yay for color and no more missing episodes!): The Silurians, but honestly Pertwee's whole first season consists of remarkably good stories.

Season 8: Season 8 focuses almost entirely on the Master and all the stories with the Delgado Master are masterpieces by default.

Season 9: Another hard choice, but I gotta go with the Time Monster. Honorable mention goes to Curse of Peladon ""Haroon haroon haroon!""

Season 10: The Three Doctors wins , but just barely beats Carnival of Monsters. Honorable mention: Planet of the Daleks. (did I mention I have a thing for Dalek stories?)

Season 11: I can't choose the best, but the worst is definitely Invasion of the Dinosaurs.

Season 12: (Hi, Tom!) The Ark in Space. Yes, Genesis of the Daleks was in this season and is obviously a landmark of the show, great story and important in the history of the show, but Ark beats it for pure awesome.

Season 13: Pyramids of Mars. Sutekh still frightens me, even though the sets and effect haven't aged well. First story I ever saw, when I was 5. Very close second: Brain of Morbius.

Season 14: Ridiculously amazing season, one of Tom's many. Robots of Death. Close second: Deadly Assassin. Honorable mention: Talons of Weng Chiang (shows its age a bit too much these days sadly).

Season 15: Horror of Fang Rock&gt;The Sun Makers&gt;Underworld&gt;The Invasion of Time, but all these stories are so amazing that they are just a hair away from being unable to rank for me.

Season 16 (Key to Time): The Pirate Planet and the Armageddon Factor are the two best serials. Power of Kroll and The Androids of Tara are the worst.

Season 17: City of Death followed closely by Destiny of the Daleks. Honorable mention: Nightmare of Eden.

Season 18: Honestly can't pick. I guess Full Circle isn't my favorite, but beyond that, I honestly can't decide.

Season 19: (Hi, Peter!) Earthshock. VERY close second: Kinda.

Season 20: Snakedance. Close second: Arc of Infinity. Honorable mention: Enlightenment followed distantly by King's Demons.

Season 21: Planet of Fire followed closely by Caves of Androzani (That's right, DW hivemind. I like the previous story better than Caves, but not by much) Honorable mention: The Awakening.

Season 22: (Colin!!! Old Sixy. STFU, haters.) Vengeance on Varos, close second: Attack of the Cybermen. Honorable mention: The Two Doctors and Mark of the Rani (You got me. I'm also a fan of Ainley's Master. Again, haters, STFU.)

Season 23: TTL is one long story, but Mindwarp is my favorite.

Season 24: (""You ain't seen nothing yet!!!"" Hello, Sylvester!) Paradise Towers. Honorable mention: Dragonfire.

Season 25: The Greatest Show in the Galaxy. Close second: Rememberance of the Daleks. Honorable mention: Silver Nemesis.

Season 26: If you have made it this far, you are required to watch Season 26 in its entirety. Don't worry, all the stories are pretty awesome.

Leading to shortages of services which can lead to resentment in the local communities.

In theory, the councils should see a proportional increase in council tax from immigrants moving to the area. The problem is that when new migrants move in they tend to (at least at first), move into shared multiple occupancy at places which are already paying council tax, leading to no immediate increases in tax revenue for local councils while at the same time increasing the number of people these councils must provide services for.

So yeah, while legal immigration is great for increased tax revenue on a national level it can lead to temporary shortages in front line social services (especially in the short-term).",0,1321026511,null,0,false,0,c2yzspa,t3_m8iu7,t1_c2yzspa,t1_c2yyv8j,1427863985,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Miraculously, it finds other living creatures and reaches out to them- subjecting itself to what is likely a very deep and intimate mind-meld with a total stranger in hopes of little more than learning the language- but instead of reaching out in return, they panic, and fight, and plot its murder from ten feet away while it's still trying to figure out all this business with the muscles and the nervous system. It tries to form a connection with the only one who seems interested and not afraid, but that just makes the others angrier, and they nearly turn on and kill them both. Its only salvation is the intervention of a less bloodthirsty individual- an intervention that involves throwing it back into the wild to resume its previous lonely existence.

""Constant government interference"", that is a joke given what is going through and who is doing it, as is the implied notion that Local Authorities are somehow hindering the running of schools, ""Over the last 20 years, the 150 English local authorities have progressively engaged less in day-to-day management of schools, but they retain duties for strategic planning of education in their areas.""
http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmchilsch/88/8806.htm
Like it or not, politicians are accountable for educational spending and for what goes on in schools. Wouldn't the plan for introducing an Educational Freedom Act be that it would be supported by an Education Standards Authority? If there is not going to be political intevention in schooling then why bother with having such an authority/quango at all? I agree that Local Authorities need bolstering in this aspect, but not without some oversight and not just for weak/underperforming schools.

What's actually happening with 'freedom to innovate' and Sponsor Managed Schools? Give all schools the freedom to innovate by making cuts in the education budget, and to fund 'Free Schools and an increase in Religious schools. Surely the interests of 'Sponsors' will undermine local democratic and parents' interests and involvement. Kinda cuts against giving ""all schools the freedom to innovate"". It's all well to talk of setting schools free to manage the curriculum,  couched in terms of enterprise and innovation but it is worth bearing in mind that it might allow schools to reintroduce Latin and Greek, to avoid vocational diplomas and to downplay citizenship, social and health education. Presumably any intervention is such instances would be a no go?

Also interesting to note that there were more similarities between Lib Dems' and manifesto education proposals than there were with the Tories, and I don't object to all of the Lib Dem's proposals. To say that what has happened, however, is in the spirit of those proposals is a big fat fucking lie and a very loose interpretation of ""more or less what's happened"". But, hey, we've got Pupil Premiums now...groan.

Although there ware obviously a fear that a breach of the peace would occur in addition to the public order threat. ""A breach of the peace occurs when harm is done, or likely to be done, to any person, or in his presence his property."" Any person may arrest another to stop or prevent a breach of the peace under the common law and may use reasonable force to do so. Section 3 of the Criminal law act also holds that any person (constable or otherwise) may use reasonable force to effect or assist in the arrest of persons committing offences, who have committed offences or are reasonable suspected of having done so, and to detain persons unlawfully at large.

If there were threats along the lines of ""Oh well, MAC won't be there so lets go and beat this lot up."" Then there would be good grounds for taking that course of action. Whilst there are some members of the EDL who are reasonable in so far as they won't do things like that, many more are not that reasonable. You also have to look at the group's history. If there were a fight between the occupy lot and the EDL the EDL would win and The occupy mob would be occupying the back of ambulances. 

Note that when someone is arrested to prevent a breach of the peace, their fingerprints, photographs and DNA are not taken as it is not a recordable offence and the police and criminal evidence act does not apply to it. It does however apply to their detention and treatment. A person is can not be guilty of a crime because it is not a crime. However they can be bound over by a magistrate to keep the peace.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I'd love to go on about how opening up hospitals to the private sector is a bad idea - I really am against it. For now though, it's just this one hospital, and I would ideally prefer it ended there, for a multitude of reasons.

The reason hospitals were so shoddy in the first place before the NHS was because they were distributed amongst the most wealthy and capable of paying. Their distribution has been so bad that I suspect even today their coverage is still not quite what it should be, since it's not cheap to build new hospitals and acquiring the capital to fund the project has taken a backseat against the initiatives of every government for a good while.

Money is a key problem on this front. We are throwing around reports and statistics saying the NHS performs worse than contemporary services, but we're not remotely looking at the fact that there are all kinds of cultural and human geographic variations within Europe that could impact health standards, which makes a side-by-side results comparison with Europe a bad idea to base reforms on.

With regards to privatization, there is a comment on that site that made me think. To paraphrase it: since producers like to set their product prices based on demand, it is not surprising that the cost of medicine is sky high given the value people place on seeing their families survive. It sums up for me exactly why the private sector should not operate using market economics in the health care sector. Of course they can deviate from this model if they wanted, but given the cost of health care in the US and their desire to stick to private health care principles, evidence suggests on a significant scale that overemphasising the role of the private sector can be detrimental to the cost and distribution of health care in society.

There are success stories to the NHS and I think there's still room for improvement, but I do not think the involvement of the private sector helps. I suspect if anything it will result in taking steps backwards from the unified service we operate today, and it removes transparency from the NHS in favour of negotiated contracts. I don't feel this will contribute to innovation in the healthcare sector or even increased efficiency, merely reduced costs and potentially decreased efficiency in the grand scheme of things.

I criticise numerous religions/religious all the time for various activities, but when it comes to criticising Islam there *is* a general sense of unease, it seems, as people are beginning to assume there are racist overtones.

Anne Marie Waters from the [One Law for All](http://www.onelawforall.org.uk/) campaign spoke about this problem (in a sense) when she address the National Secular Society Conference in September.

It's not racism since Islam isn't a race, but I'd say that's a technicality.  This isn't a considered objection to various issues with Islamic culture.  People oppose Islam because it's different and that scares them.  Anything else is a rationalisation.

true,sqrrl101,null,null,"Not sure what'll be going on for New Year's eve, but here's my general recommendation for pleasant places in Oxford:


**Bars/pubs:**

* *Raoul's*, cocktail bar in Jericho.
One of the best cocktail bars in the country serving a wide variety of classic and novel cocktails in a relaxed atmosphere. The staff are always willing to give advice or make something bespoke, and the drinks are always superb.
http://www.raoulsbar.co.uk/

* *The Turf*, old pub just off Holywell street.
Bit on the pricey side for a pub, but the building is a lovely ancient thing and it's nestled out of the way down an easily-miss-able alley. Serves a variety of ales and whatnot and they do roast chestnuts during winter.
http://www.theturftavern.co.uk/

* *The House*, cocktail bar on Blue Boar street.
Their range isn't quite as good as Raoul's, but they serve good quality cocktails and the bar has a wonderful intimate feel. Very generous happy hour, too.
http://www.housebar.co.uk/

* *Brown's*, cocktail bar/brasserie on Woodstock road.
An excellent place to go for a refined lunch, Brown's serves some lovely high-quality food in addition to having a very well-stocked bar with staff who know their stuff when it comes to cocktails. The atmosphere is generally very refined, the seats comfortable, and they sometimes have a live pianist playing their grand piano.
http://www.browns-restaurants.co.uk/locations/oxford/


**Restaurants:**

* *Atomic Burger*, burger joint on Cowley road.
Decorated with 80s/90s pop culture icons and dripping with nostalgia. Does a huge array of burgers (including veggie option), hot dogs, etc. All the ones I've tried have been delicious and the portions are significant. They do superb breakfasts, too.
http://atomicburger.co.uk/

* *Al Shami*, Lebanese restaurant in Jericho.
They serve authentic Lebanese and related middle-eastern food which is totally delicious. Very pleasant decor, too.
http://www.al-shami.co.uk/

* *Jamie's*, Italian on George street.
Not the cheapest place, but not ridiculous by restaurant standards and they serve genuinely delicious food. I'm personally not a fan of Jamie Oliver, but god damn that man can put together some lovely recipes.
http://www.jamieoliver.com/italian/oxford

* *Al Andalus*, tapas bar on Little Clarendon street.
Serve a good range of tapas dishes ideal for sharing. Pretty reasonably priced and gives you a good range of things to try.
http://www.tapasoxford.co.uk/


**Attractions:**

* *The Ashmolean*, museum in city centre.
Houses one of the world's best collections of ancient and recent historical art and cultural artefacts. I'm no expert in the area, but it's definitely worth a wander around as the building is stuffed with beautiful treasures. Also, there's a cafe/restaurant on the roof which is reputed to be top-notch.
www.ashmolean.org

* *Modern Art Oxford*, art museum on pembroke street.
Again I'm no expert on the subject, but I understand that it has a rather well-respected collection of modern art, and I've certainly enjoyed the occasional wander around.
http://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/

* *Covered Market*, on the High Street.
I know nothing of the covered market's history, but it's a large indoor market with lots of shops ranging from authentic hand-crafted stuff to old-style butchers to tatty t-shirts. Very definitely worth a wander around, if only to see what's there.
http://www.oxfordcity.co.uk/shops/market/

* *Natural History Museum/Pitt Rivers*, adjoining museums on Parks road.
Housed in the same buildings, these two museums are together possibly my favourite place in the city. The first one has probably the UK's finest collection of skeletons, fossils, minerals, etc. outside of London as well as various other weird and wonderful exhibits (e.g. tank of live cockroaches). The latter is one of the world's best anthropological museums with bizarre and fascinating items from a dizzying array of cultures and time-periods. I'd recommend getting up early and devoting a full day to these two museums as there's a lot to see.
http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/
http://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/

* *History of Science Museum*, museum on Broad street.
Housed in the world's oldest purpose-built museum building, this contains an array of scientific instruments and equipment stretching back over hundreds of years and covering medicine, physics, chemistry, etc. They often have superb exhibitions on, too, including a wonderful steampunk one last year.

* *Port Meadow*, big field in West Oxford.
This open area is ""common land"" which means it's governed by some weird set of traditional rights. I don't really understand the details, but it's a lovely open field with a couple of small lakes and animals constantly grazing. If you enjoy walking, this is a great destination, and it tends to look particularly spectacular at sunset/sunrise.

* *The University*, everywhere.
Oxford University, the world's most ancient English-speaking university and arguably the best, is distributed throughout the whole city and it's pointless trying to see it all. What's definitely worthwhile, however, is taking a wander around some of the colleges that compose it. They have some stunning architecture and if you're going in winter then there shouldn't be too many students around getting pissed off at your wandering aimlessly about their home. The standard colleges to visit would be Christ Church and Magdalen, which both have amazing imposing buildings, but I'd also recommend having a look around Balliol (on Broad Street) which is a bit smaller but is one of the oldest (along with University and Merton) and has some rather impressive plant life.

So, yeah, that's my thoroughly biased list of suggestions. For more, I recommend starting here - http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/guide/oxintro.html

Also, easiest way to get to Oxford from London is probably getting a train from Paddington, but it's certainly not the cheapest. My preferred method is the Oxford Tube (http://www.oxfordtube.com/). Much cheaper (especially if you aren't booking well in advance), runs throughout the night, and I'd argue it's more comfortable. Free WiFi, too.

Just because there is no government imposed regeneration limit anymore, it doesnt mean that time lords dont naturally have a limit themselves. It could be like a human growing old. After enough regenerations, their regenerative abilities might just crap out, causing them mutations or simply death from not having enough regenerative energy to complete the process.      
     
This may be why the Doctor (when he was young) never seemed too concerned about missing/extra limbs or features, yet the recent older doctors seem to get worried about it. He's getting old. 
         
12 may have been the old limit, but a time lord could possibly have enough energy to regenerate 16 times (or 100 times, or 507. Who knows). But in theory, it was never unlimited.        
**tl;dr It's loosely similar to if our government had mandatory euthanasia at age 70.  If one day they stop euthanizing all the old folks, it doesnt mean the old folks are now immortal. They may still have a decade or two left in them.** 
     
Bottom line, Time Lords have a lot of regenerative energy, but not unlimited regenerative energy. River used all of the energy she had to bring a completely dead body back to life. ",0,1321050148,null,0,false,0,c2z34i6,t3_m51ut,t1_c2z34i6,t3_m51ut,1427865617,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I think Downing and Adam can both be great assets to the team, but at the moment they're both a bit hit and miss. Sometimes you see sparks of genius from them (like a brilliant cross, or some great vision). Other times they cause me to rage.

I'd also like to see Maxi get in ahead of Downing for two reasons: 1. I think Maxi and Suarez link up well together 2. Seeing Maxi starting will make Downing have to pull his finger out and hopefully become a better player. Having the players fight for a place in the starting 11 seems to be working for Man City so could work for us too.

As for Carroll... well I don't want to see him dismissed so soon (especially since he cost so much) but at the same time I'd rate Suarez (obviously), Kuyt and even Bellamy ahead of him in the strikers role. But if he doesn't play and develop he'll never work out so he still needs a place. I'd like to see:

true,[deleted],null,null,"Compared to the historical record, a top marginal tax rate of 50% is not high at all. There's a reason why things [went to shit in the 80s](http://www.dailydoseofexcel.com/blogpix/teaparty1.gif) (US figures). The UK has a smilar trend over the same time:

&gt; [In 1974 the top-rate of income tax increased to its highest rate since the war, 83%. This applied to incomes over £20,000 (£155,247 as of 2011)...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_Kingdom)

I don't think it is a coincidence that there was a high taxation for the super rich of the 50s, 60s and 70s, and emergence of mass further education, improved public health, longevity, accelerated technological growth, and good infrastructure. Society was doing so well it supported a generation of lay about hippies one could point out!

What you, like many, don't seem to realise is that people can be effectively taxed nearing 50% of their income anyway, and as a percentage of income, the figure generally gets higher the poorer you get. Immediately people are hit with 20% and practically another 20% disappears through VAT alone, then add on cigarettes, university fees†, fuel duty, road tax, TV license, council tax, and it quickly escalates. (Of course this doesn't include the general 'poverty tax': higher insurance contributions for the bad neighbourhood, higher impacts of crime, greater ill-health, etc, which are all made worse by wealth inequality). Meanwhile, there is only so much of the essentials that the rich can buy, so the money naturally accrues for the fabled '1 percenters'. Business therefore goes after this 'free' money and investment is skewed towards luxury industry, and technology or infrastructure that *would** be beneficial for the less affluent goes neglected. 

The luxury economy expands (which is of no real benefit to the poor) and resources are wasted on gratuities, but even then there is only so much of that the super rich can buy. The money has to go somewhere, maybe a second or third home which inflates the housing market, or off it disappears to various abstract financial markets remote from the real economy. Of course the monied gets the bonus of having their piles work for them, and the poor get the extra tax of having to service debt (+bank changes, late fees, and so on).

The greater the wealth the more wasteful and dangerous the individual, so there needs to be an entropic effect that counter acts the gravity that capital has (money --&gt; more influence --&gt; more money --&gt; repeat). To continue the analogy are you surprised that there has been so many financial black-holes? [Notice the damning lack of entries until the 80s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis#20th_century).

† A note on university fees: lets say a student is 35k£ in debt (which can never be bankrupted away!!) after three years, in reality though he has lost 3 years income, so it's something nearer an 80k£ deduction. For the rest of his life he takes in 35k£ a year and works for 45 years, that's roughly an extra 2% tax for the rest of his working life just including the debt. Add the debt and losses and that totals a loss worth 5% over his entire life.",0,1321069524,null,0,true,0,c2z59wp,t3_m9all,t1_c2z59wp,t3_m9all,1427866627,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Your aggression here is misplaced, though, because although the OP is using the wrong term (through no fault of his own, it's just a specific ignorance on this point), the sentiment is positive.

Next morning, I get up to get ready for work to find my 10 year old son passed out in the hallway.  He'd gotten up in the middle of the night, unable to breathe and tried to come to our bedroom to ask for help.  He was running 105 degree fever and barely conscious.

We rushed him to the hospital only to have him diagnosed with double pneumonia.  I ended up staying home with him for 4 weeks until he was finally cleared by the doctor to go back to school and get back to his regular stuff.

I can tell you, the worst feeling I've had as a parent was when the doctor was listening to my son's lungs, got that **LOOK** on his face and said ""huh..., that's not right...""  Thought my life was ending.

The ER doc said the same thing yours did, sometimes with kids, it can come out of the blue and hit like a mack truck.  Thankfully, my son recovered and is back to his normal self.

I guess it's because the Daleks are supposed to be such great enemies of the Doctor, but I found the whole confrontation to be lacking.  

I will agree with a lot of my fellow Love and Monster haters.  Although I loved Elton and his dancing, I just didn't like the villain, it was just awful.  The idea behind it wasn't necessarily the worst, but it certainly was great.  That coupled with poor execution left me baffled as to how this actually aired.  The fact that Elton mentions a love life also creeped me out severely, because what the hell?  All of this being said, however, I actually liked the format of the show where it displayed a different point of view from the Doctor and you get to see how large an impact the Doctor has on the people he comes into contact.

true,tangled_foot,uk,The Toon,"Yup, I have refused to buy a poppy for the last couple of years.

Two main reasons:

The british legion is all well and good but in terms of how much I give a shit about things, helping the guy whose leg got blown off in Afghanistan because he made a shitty career choice is pretty much at the bottom of my concerned list.

The whole thing is just a massive excuse to glorify the army, which I, almost without exception, disagree with. Its a massive recruitment drive, the army should not be allowed to march through our towns and cities, well not until the day that the police and firemen do the same thing to 'remember' their dead. The whole thing is sick. 

Which leads on to bonus point 3 - Who the fuck are we remembering anyway? WW2 and WW1 veterans, well that's one thing, but 'remember the soldiers in Afghanistan?' what the fuck? I don't owe them the respect of remembering them more than I do anyone else who has died at work (tree surgeon died the other day..just trying to save trees...tragic), for the people who *actually* remember them, well they have to deal with it every fucking day, for me to hang my head and act all remorseful, well that's just a piss take. I (and 99% of the other people holding silences) didn't give a shit about them the other 51 weeks of the year, I don't really see why I need to start now. It was their stupid choice to join the army and now its their family who have to deal with their mistakes.

What we should do is focus on ways people can help the country without flying off to far away lands to be shot. Because most of the people I know who are in the army are there because they didn't really have another option. So I guess that it is sad that these are the people who are dying, but if we (as a society) stopped glorifying killing foreigners and started sorting out these problems by providing people with options maybe we wouldn't have to 'remember' so many people.

Personally I'm only aware of two people who were circumcised: One for religion (1980's) and the other from 'tradition' I think (1940's).

The justification argument: Yes indeed. I think anyone who is aware of the for and against arguments but isn't circumcised etc. and is in favour of the practice is in a very small minority. It seems to be predominantly those who have something invested in circumcision that are in favour, very similar to female circumcision (all of it, not just *the worst* type). In fact the usual cry of ""You can't compare the two!"" is rubbish: There are so many parallels, which are quite blatantly obvious, that it's an injustice to both infant girls and boys to separate them based on sex.    

I'm doing research on circumcision on and off at the moment, so if I find anything relevant *and* remember (the important bit), I'll let you know.

They have 3 levels, option 1,2,3 and infinity.

Option 1 is throttled and capped to shit, but then you only get 10gb a month, so if anything this is a good thing as it stops people uploading 5 gb of iplayer data. But only none http is controlled (so this is what your linked chart shows). 

Option 2 is the same as option 1 but gives you 40 GB a month to use.

Option 3, is throttled if usage is over 500gb on non-http (very easy to circumvent using encryption on utorrent btw)

Infinity can be had on either option 2 or 3 and I assume they apply their fair usage policy in the same way for either.

For me the thing that matters is that time and again BT have shown that they don't hand out cease and desist notices (unlike virgin) and they don't throttle connections (on option 3) based on the time of day (like virgin do) and they are lobbying for less regulation of internet connections (i.e. digital economies act) unlike virgin, who support it. 

All companies have a maximum usage limit, unless you have a corporate account, and 500 gb is actually very high. So if you want fast broadband you're much better off with BT than Virgin.

Then another lady jumps out the door with her and saves everyone. Just seemed a bit dull. However, when I re-watched it I gained a little more appreciation for it.

So the visuals are lacking quite a bit (which never bothers me, but I know some people just can't get past it).  Then there's the.... ""Start at season 5 and watch Matt Smith"" because they gave it such a fresh start when he came in, but I personally prefer not to go all the way through a newer season then back up. 

That being said, my personal opinion is... watch Blink. Season 3, episode... 11 I believe? Anytime I introduce someone to Doctor who, I put Blink on and have them watch it, give it about a week, and they tell me that they're hopelessly addicted. Every time. I think the reason is that the series was re-established enough at that point so it was visually gratifying as well as just super wonderful writing. This isn't a main story by any means, so you don't have to have a lot of foreknowledge of Doctor Who to be able to understand it. The Doctor isn't even the focal point of this episode, but it just gives you such a feel for how the show comes off.  From there, I would say jump back to season 1's episode titled ""The Empty Child"". The visuals are a bit better by this time (though not as good as they started becoming in season 2 until now), but you can get a enough of a feel for Chris Eccleston to just sort of fall in love. This is definitely my favorite season 1 episode. And from there, I'd say go back to the beginning of the new series and go in order.

As a rule of thumb someone who puts the keys in the glove box and goes to sleep on the back seat is showing no likelihood that they intend to drive the vehicle because they are not in the driver's seat and access to the keys is not ready. If the keys were not in the vehicle and that would (as you describe) completely immobilise the vehicle then again I would personally think that you would have no likelihood of driving.

true,bored-now,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I did the same thing with Ian.  What made it worse for me is he's one of those kids that never - ever - gets sick.  When we moved to Oregon from Colorado, he'd already had all of his vaccinations, and we were so busy doing other stuff, we never really got around to getting him signed up with a primary care physician.  If he needed a physical for something, we would just take him to my husbands doctor who would give him a quick once over, check his vaccination records, sign the papers and send us on our merry way.

Then there we were in the ER, and I was near hysterical with everything that I could have done better to prevent my son coming down with this, second guessing every decision I made.  He'd had the cough and the off/on fever for 3 days, should I have taken him to the urgent care sooner?  If he'd had a PCP, would they have picked up on something different?   Did the urgent care miss something obvious?  What if I'd hit the snooze on my alarm and hadn't gotten up when I did??

Thankfully, the ER doc was a kind man, and saw all the emotions going across my face while we waited for the tests to come back, and I watched my normally vibrant son who had a habit of bouncing off the walls with energy, lay in the hospital bed, struggling to breathe, and he explained to me that odds are, the urgent care doctor probably didn't miss anything, and that my husband and I had done all that we could to care for him, and make sure he was okay.  It was just one of those things that can happen, and pneumonia can hit really fast and knock someone down within 24 hours.

I wish you strength, and blessings upon you and your family.  I can't imagine the pain you went through when you lost your child, but know this - you probably did everything right, all within your power.  Know also that you loved your son, and he loved you right back in return, and the love of a child is the greatest joy someone can feel.

Whether Ptolemy would have had Pytheas' real latitudes at that time is a much debated issue.

* Got banned from a kebab shop.

* Went to take a piss in the sea after leaving a club and underestimated the size of the waves - result: ruined shoes/everything wet.

* Needed a piss so bad on the N25 but could not hold it. Used a beer can instead. Also, smoked on the bus (no memory of this).

* Found £25 on the floor at Digital and spent it all on jagerbombs in matter of minutes.

* Went for a walk around campus when bored and crashed parties.

* Woke up in a random hallway. No idea.

* Contemplated cooking a rabbit. They looked delicious.

* On more than one occasion, my housemates did not want to go out so I went clubbing on my own. Met lots of people and rarely got back on my own. Good times.

&gt;Dispatches investigates one of the most powerful and influential political lobbies in Britain, which is working in support of the interests of the State of Israel.

&gt;Despite wielding great influence among the highest realms of British politics and media, little is known about the individuals and groups which collectively are known as the pro-Israel lobby.

&gt;Political commentator Peter Oborne sets out to establish who they are, how they are funded, how they work and what influence they have, from the key groups to the wealthy individuals who help bankroll the lobbying.

&gt;He investigates how accountable, transparent and open to scrutiny the lobby is, particularly in regard to its funding and financial support of MPs.

&gt;The pro-Israel lobby aims to shape the debate about Britain's relationship with Israel and future foreign policies relating to it.

&gt;Oborne examines how the lobby operates from within parliament and the tactics it employs behind the scenes when engaging with print and broadcast media.

The only person who can know how much revision you need is you, I'm afraid.

Consider this - You only have 5 exams. I realise I just said ""only"" but realise that it is more than do-able. If it weren't then the system would not work this way and you'd be doing less. I realise it's a shitty thing to do, but I did similar topics to do and I managed it. So do many others every year.

I also took Maths and Chem (and similar subjects) so I can at least relate to those topics. When I got to Uni I average more than 15 exams every summer, usually over a two week period. It's do-able! So are your five. Don't look at the overall picture, but rather break them down into chunks.

Can I ask what modules you're doing in maths? I assume you have the syllabuses for all the topics. My overall advise would be to go over them again and again (which might seem obvious) ensuring you're not brushing over things that are a little too complex.

If you want or are after it, I'm sure I can help you to a certain degree with some topics. I ended up doing Maths &amp; Physics at Uni so *might* be in a position to help you with various things. My maths modules were P1-6, M1-3 and S1-3, even though that was 2002. I'm a Physics postgrad now - not blowing my own trumpet but letting you know that I am likely to be able to help a little bit with one or two of your issues. I could be able to help!

Categorise and Memorise. Just break things down, set manageable goals and take it a bit at a time.

If you feel you need more or that you aren't doing well enough in mock papers, try and make that one hour into an hour and a half. Weekends you should probably spend two hours a day or more if you have the time.

It's all about the goals. Just break it down, target things one by one and you're fine.


One last thing - make a list of the topics you really find yourself struggling with and spend more time on them. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and all that.

Then you have to spend time on seducing her (which could range anywhere from less than an hour to several weeks, depending on variables), and then you get to have sex. If you want to have sex and are OK paying for it, then you simply visit adultwork.com, spend some time browsing until you find someone and book an appointment. This could take you 15mins or so. That could well be addictive in the long run, especially if your not able to do well in relationships for whatever reason.

But then there are things like specific kinks, you might want to have sex with a Thai girl with huge tits and curly hair, a blond SSBBW, or a girl who is (or  just looks like) the girl on the cover of Super Spunky Adventure Park 9.  Or you might just be a guy who's wife doesn't want sex anymore, but you have kids, a mortgage, and your president of the local wine &amp; cheese club so a divorce would just be unfortunate.

Personally I have no need to pay for sex, but I can see how other people might want to. And when it comes to sex in relationships, I've had some amazing sex with women who are just weird and unstable, or unsuitable for relationships (thinks *Being Jordan* is the best book ever written...), so it's not a hard and fast rule. Depends how closely you link emotion with sexual pleasure, which isn't that closely for me but then I'm apparently slightly sociopathic.

true,Alex_Plalex,dalek,Dalek,"Female Whovian here: we get a bad rap because of obvious reasons concerning the stunning cast of male actors.

I just want to say that there are definitely multiple layers to why I love it so much. On one hand, there is the amazing world they've created, with the possibilities and stories and characters. It set my imagination ablaze, and it's affected the way I think and see things in real life and in my head as well.

I've also properly discovered a lot more British TV that isn't the stuff that's made it across the pond yet, solely from watching actors from DW guest on it like QI, Nevermind the Buzzcocks, etc., among other random BBC series with DW actors in them. It's nice to have the connections to spider out with instead of just blindly jumping in.

Then there's the brilliant writing and emotional connections to the characters. Then the character and plot analysis, and speculation, and theories, and the online community of Whovians... that's a really fun part too. Probably my favorite.

Then, it's just ridiculously iconic, and I think that's partly what gets people so pumped up about it, because there are so many little codes and symbols that people can display and relate to, and maybe find other fans they can geek out with, or whatever.

And finally, yes, there are a lot of really attractive fellas.. Barrowman, Tennant, Darvill, Smith... which is really just a nice bonus. Yes, I've gone through and upvoted every DT post on r/ladyboners and will continue to do so as they crop up, BUT... that is far from the only reason I like Doctor Who.

I think most (if not all for some) of those reasons really apply to anyone. Personally I hardly know anyone who knows of the show, and the few fans I've found are probably close to 50/50.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The GA is able to make procedural (as opposed to substantive) resolutions that the security council cannot interfere with at first blush.

The security council can interfere by exploiting technicalities (such as by declaring the subject-matter of the resolution one which the security council is currently excercising judgment over.) Such a manoeuvres will effectively 'claim jurisdiction' over the topic, and prevent the GA from passing resolutions on it. If the GA was going to do something particularly inflammatory with Palestine, the US could easily raise this and block the GA from discussion. You may think the other SC members who support Palestine may stop this, but they wont. The general principle that a SC member gets its way in determining whether an issue concerns it or not is a universally supported goal that all of the P5 agree upon.


But that aside let's return to the issue at hand. The Vatican and other organizations relationship with the UN can be split into 2 components:

* That they are a recognized sovereign state
* That they are accepted into the UN as an observer


The two issues are severable, and as I'm sure you can see, one of the issues is a procedural matter for the GA, and one is a question of international law (substantive). 


**Palestine is already an observer in the GA**. 

Which means the only issue left is the **substantive** one of whether it is a sovereign state. That brings us back full circle, a GA resolution to give Palestine the same position as the vatican is really a substantive resolution to give it sovereign statehood. 

That **can** be vetoed by the SC, or will simply be ignored in international law as not attempting to change Palestine's status in any way shape or form.  ",0,1321184900,null,0,false,0,c2zet5o,t3_ma08f,t1_c2zet5o,t1_c2zejie,1427871192,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"&gt; The revelation that the company shares some of the fears of its critics has caused fresh uproar.

Why? Surely it's a good thing that they recognise some of the problems that may occur in the future so they can prevent them. Wouldn't it be worse if they just continued blindly pretending that taking over a hospital wont have an affect on the operation of their business. If they'd just said ""nah, everything will be fine"" then they'd have been slated lying or ignoring the implications of taking over this hospital, so they can't really win.

The important thing is how they deal with it. I notice there is no link to the document in question and all we're given is a couple of sentences out of context. Without this we don't know if the document continues to address the concerns, are they going to do something about it or just ignore it? Do they have a strategy to make sure care is not affected? 

Instead the article just panders to the leftist misconception that the only people who can provide good health care are the state and that everyone else are just blood sucking vampires trying to gut the NHS for profit.

It really annoys me that people can't have an objective conversation about health care in this country without their emotions getting in the way.

I just found the [document](http://www.circleholdingsplc.com/uploads/document/file/19/circle_holdings_admission_document_20110614.pdf) in question. Here is the section (page 21) that the quote is from:

&gt; **If Circle fails to effectively manage its anticipated growth it will have an adverse effect on Circle’s business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects and consequently those of the Company.**

&gt; As well as the establishment of further independent hospitals, Circle intends to significantly expand its NHS business. Circle’s growth has placed, and its anticipated growth will continue to place, a strain on its managerial, administrative, operational, financial, information technology and other resources and could affect its ability to provide a consistent level of service to its patients. Circle intends to further expand its overall business, headcount and operations in different geographic areas in the UK. The Group will also face additional obligations in connection with becoming an AIM quoted company, for example compliance with increased disclosure, reporting and corporate governance standards. To manage its growth, **the Group will need to** continue to improve its managerial, administrative, operational, financial, information technology and other resources and reporting systems and procedures. Moreover, **the Group will need to** implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across all of the Group’s existing and future hospitals and facilities. **These efforts may divert the attention of its personnel from its core business operations, any of which may adversely affect its financial performance**.

I also just tried opening newzbin.com and couldn't, so unless it's coincidentally down anyway, looks like their filtering of _that_ sort is applied to infinity too.

I don't really care much about the throttling personally because \*gasp\* I buy nearly all my entertainment on cds and dvds anyway, and when I do occasionally torrent something, I don't find it a hardship to stick it on overnight.  It would do that anyway, it's just considerate to housemates.  The other sort of filtering I don't like at all, even though I dont want to use newzbin anyway, I see more of a 'slippery slope' there that is very distasteful.  (If you're thinking I'm a hypocrite, well, I didnt want to use BT at all in the first place, but it wasnt entirely my decision.)

All that notwithstanding, speed is fully as advertised, it's actually not like the unrealistic marketing bullshit we've seen around ADSL which greentoastandbacon mentioned (though I agree it's no surprise if people assume it would be).

That's because the system is much busier during the day than at night, and runs more slowly.

Do you have encryption set to 'forced' in utorrent (or whatever you're using)?

They will only ever throttle non-http, so the easiest way to see if you're being throttled is to go onto a really strong torrent, I would recommend the official ubuntu iso torrent as it always has a load of seeders. Try it with and without encryption, if it runs faster when encrypted, then you're being throttled.

Its worth leaving utorrent on 'enabled' anyway, as then it will use encryption if possible, and you shouldn't have any issues with throttling.

Quick PSA: the number of upvotes and downvotes does not accurately reflect how redditors have voted. Reddit only accurately determines the 'score', or the difference between the two--the ""real"" numbers for the upvotes and downvotes are fuzzed, to prevent spam/bots/etc. Fuzzing the numbers prevents pay-for-vote scenarios, because those offering the pay won't have any way of knowing whether or not you've voted.

Make a note of everything they say to you, and insist a note of your phonecall is made.
Explain that you will be sending a copy of your tenancy agreement over,  and this will show when you moved in and that the debt is not yours, don't take their BS that it is not sufficient, it is. Also make a note of how much you have been wrongly charged in debt. 

Did you swap the bill over to your name when you moved in before realising there was a debt on it?

There is probably an appeal to *actually talking* to a *real girl* when you're this horny. From what I recall of Babestation you can see her live on the screen whilst you talk to her - that has attractions that photos don't, and there's more interaction than a prerecorded video.

I guess the experience of chatting on cam-whore sites feels similarly interactive, but I would guess there's a convenience about being able to pick up the phone and dial - a guy can get through quickly and spontaneously and without thinking about it (or the price).",0,1321212871,null,0,false,0,c2zh6t5,t3_ma64r,t1_c2zh6t5,t1_c2zbtvj,1427872327,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Get over it, Torres was not a youth player and all loyalty would have been lost when Rafa left. We have Suarez, who presently, is in excellent form similar to the 2007-08 Torres.  ",0,1321216141,null,0,true,0,c2zhlad,t3_mazrh,t1_c2zhlad,t3_mazrh,1427872501,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Nope. Auton Rory opened it with the sonic.

&gt;2) The Sonic Screwdriver has been as much of a part of The Doctor as his own being. It's an extension of him. A Sonic was inside the Pandorica. A Sonic was on the outside of the Pandorica. Same thing, opens it.
