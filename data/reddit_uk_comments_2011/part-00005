true,BarelyReal,null,null,"Since the end of series 5 I've been going back a lot and re-examining 10 from a more suspicious perspective. In my opinion The Doctor has always struggled with the ethics or mechanics of making these changes or interfering, he has just always been able to get over it fairly quickly. 10 wanted to be the dashing good guy loved by many, because he still could not face what he did during the Time War and why. 9 was cynical and rough around the edges. He had to work harder to see the good in everyone and everybody, and the first series to me was like his rediscovery of how fun and positive time travel can be. 10, on the other hand, still hadn't worked out his own issues. I think he came across the most ""Human"" because in a weird way he wished he could be this romanticized version of humanity, devoid of their worst traits and the worst traits of the Time Lords. Waters of Mars was his confronting just what he is: a Time Lord, a being capable of abusing great power. He faced his inner demon and the inner demon came very close to winning out. The End of Time, at that point, is almost like the Universe's way of balancing out by making sure the Time Lords were secured and 10 died. 

Then 11 comes along after 10 went out all but kicking and screaming. 11 comes along and he's more like The Doctors of old, as if he's finally let go of all the baggage of the Time War and he's comfortable just being. He's accepted what he is and where he's been, but he never looks back. He's always just moving on, moving on so fast he can barely stay in the ""now"".

Homosexuality shouldn't be *pushed* as something interesting or unusual it should just come up naturally with nothing special attributed to it, unless its actually relevant to the discussion. You don't say ""Albert Einstein, a famous Jewish scientist"", you say ""Albert Einstein blah blah blah"" and would normally only mention his Jewish ancestry in the context of him getting the fuck out of Nazi Germany. If romantic relationships or historical interest happen to come up just bring it up as if its something normal, not something special that has to be pointed out and looked at is if its a special case.

I don't don't want history lessons to start with ""Alan Turin, a homosexual, blah blah"". Say ""Alan Turing invented lots of cool stuff"" and then end with ""and when the authorities found out he was shagging a guy they persecuted him to the point of suicide."" Its not something special or relevant to 99% of the material so it should stop being seen as something so abnormal and weird that you have to point it out.

I think if we had lessons where we were given lists of ""famous black people"" a lot of people would be fairly annoyed about it, why should it be any different? Sexuality shouldn't be an issue unless its relevant to the discussion.

I can see why people would disagree though- some people think it should be pushed and pushed so kids realise that there are lots of gays. Thing is I think kids already realise gays exist, but the problem is kids learn that gays are ""special"" rather than ""normal"" because everyone else makes a big deal of it.

 He just signed for a new club that's paying him an exorbitant amount of money; what else is he to say? As I read it, he is not insulting anybody directly, which would be something along the lines of ""Finally, I get to play for a top-level team, which I did not have the privilege of in my last club."" Rather, he is complementing the team he just signed for, with a few supporters of his former club reading too deeply into what he said.

To deny the fact the he thinks highly of Liverpool is a bit of a reactionary stance, in my eyes. As I said before: He did well for Liverpool, and was a upstanding player while he did so. He's immensely talented, if a bit moody, and I wish him the best.

I'm totally in favour of positive representations of all consensual sexualities in school, but I don't think any should be presented as being 'cooler' than any other.  Just as sex is said to be 10% of a good relationship and 90% of a bad one, so sexuality should be of minimal importance to a fair and just society, just as it's been of too much concern to a prejudiced and unjust one.

I don't expect us not to have put in some bids for a striker since I read some forums and people are demanding Levy and Harry's heads. But what they are constantly doing is improving the squad. Pienaar is a good player and will offer something extra (mind, I'm surprised Kranjcar is still here, albeit pleasantly). Pip Neville and Charlie Adams wouldn't have been marquee signings but both offer a lot.

Bear in mind a misfiring Chels teams have signed a £50m striker who ""can't play upfront with a partner"", is in terrible form, and will probably demand a start (from fans, the player, the fee etc).

Pushing a leaflet through a door is not criminal damage unless it was a leaflet written on an axe. Has she even been charged with anything, or was it just a case of sticking her in a van for a bit? In that case, trying to stop an arrest would have turned a slightly tumultuous into a violent one. The best thing to do in that situation is to go along with it while playfully taking the piss.

The only time you can really stop an arrest if is you have overwhelming force and a very high probability of success. It is high stakes and if you fuck it up, not only are people likely to get hurt, you'll probally end up in a cell on an assault charge. 

As for the cops, you do kinda have to feel sorry for them. Most of them probally don't really care either way on the issues in question, although on this one they probally do.

&gt;We're reaching critical mass for Doctor Who spoilers, so let's jump right into it. Production is currently underway for Steven Moffat's episode seven, which is the first half of the season-spanning cliffhanger. Simon Fisher-Becker's CV lists his blue-skinned technology dealer - who we first saw with River in The Pandorica Opens - as being called Dorium Maldavar. More intriguingly, he is listed as appearing in an episode called ""Demons Run"" - and signs on the location filming for that episode display that particular phrase. So it would appear ""Demons Run"" is the title... now we just have to figure out whether the omitted apostrophe was intentional or not. ([Doctor Who Spoilers](http://doctorwhospoilers.com/2011/2011/01/and-the-title-of-the-game-changing-episode-seven-is/))

&gt;That same sign that reveals the title of episode 7 also features a strange new logo that we haven't seen before. It's thought to be the logo of the Clerics, the church-run army seen in ""Time of the Angels""/""Flesh and Stone"", as it resembles the patch worn by the soldiers and River Song in those episodes. The logo combines the symbols of the US Air Force, Chrysler...and the Greek letter Omega. Of course, Omega is the name of the legendary Time Lord that menaced the Doctor a couple times in the classic series, and has been widely rumored to return since the beginning of series five. So this might be the first hint of Omega's role in the proceedings...although it's so minor that it might just be included as a little in-joke by the production team, and Omega isn't really coming back. ([Life, Doctor Who, &amp; Combom](http://lifetheuniverseandcombom.blogspot.com/2011/01/omegacleric-logo-for-series-6-doctor.html))

&gt;As for the monsters in ""Demons Run"", we can now confirm that at least one Sontaran makes an appearance, as Dan Starkey's CV lists him as a Sontaran in this episode. He previously played Commander Skorr in ""The Sontaran Stratagem""/""The Poison Sky"", among other new series roles. The Cybermen have also been spotted on set for this episode, although we still don't have any confirmation of the rumors that the original series Mondasian Cybermen will appear. ([Doctor Who Spoilers](http://doctorwhospoilers.com/2011/2011/01/a-legion-of-cybermen-and-some-casting-news-for-episode-seven/) and [part 2](http://doctorwhospoilers.com/2011/2011/01/unmasking-the-sontaran/))

&gt;Now onto episode three. This spot was originally occupied by Neil Gaiman's episode, but that episode has now been moved to the fourth position, with Mark Gatiss's ""What Are Little Boys Made Of?"" moving to the second half of the season. This new episode three is written by Sherlock writer Steven Thompson. Casting is coming together very quickly, and there are some exciting names for fans of prestige television, as Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville is playing a pirate captain named Avery - who may or may not be the real life pirate John Avery (also known as Henry Every), arguably the most successful pirate of all time. If so, this isn't the first time Avery has figured in Doctor Who — William Hartnell's penultimate story ""The Smugglers"" is all about the search for Avery's gold. The episode is currently filming down in Cornwall, which is where ""The Smugglers"" was set. So yeah... this episode might feature the most awesomely obscure in-jokes and past story references in Doctor Who history. I'm excited. ([The Doctor Who News Page](http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2011/01/dwn280111162008-doctor-who-casting-and.html))

&gt;Finally, a few more casting notes. Misfits actor Danny Sapani (he plays probation officer Tony Morecombe) will appear in the new episode 3 as Colonel Manton. Lee Ross, who played Gene Hunt's arch-nemesis Litton on Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes, is playing the Boatswain, getting us yet another tiny step closer to DCI Hunt himself raging into the TARDIS in some future episode. And, going back to ""Demons Run"", Annabel Cleare and her young son Henry are both in the episode, playing what the older Cleare describes as ""small"" roles.

Could have also mentioned that Westminster does in fact have ultimate sovereignty over the devolved Parliaments and can technically withdraw their power at any time...

But one thing that I wanted to point out was that you mentioned that he made us feel important. I think this is where a lot of the hurt comes from because he was a world class striker to us and he was someone who EVERYONE revered. We felt special because we had someone that everyone wanted, someone that was a staple and an icon to not only Liverpool, but to football in general. 

With the money from the purchase we were able to secure two great strikers that should make for a better situation. Someone posted:

Carroll + Suarez &gt; Torres
....and I agree with it.

Although it's heartbreaking, in the end, everyone should have gotten what they wanted. We wanted a pair of amazing strikers, Torres wanted to be on a team with with a horse and a wife stealer.

I'm not sure how the caps are enforced in the UK these days though, when I lived there I had some shitty 10gb plan too but breached it by a good 90gb every month and never heard a peep from my ISP.

Prior to that I had cable, back before virgin took over and they had no caps or throttling - as far as I'm aware modern day cable in the UK throttles certain protocols during the day but allows full whack downloading overnight.  I wasn't happy to move to a city where there was no cable and have to sign up for crappy adsl.

I guess the fuss is all about how unreasonable these caps are in this day and age - ISPs keep pushing this idea that anyone using over 25gb a month is most likely a pirate and not the typical user when the reality is that the nature of the internet is just massively bandwidth intensive these days, you could easily eat 200gb without any pirating.   It's a step backwards, it was when these caps were introduced in the UK and still is now in Canada.

It's profiteering, pure and simple and it shouldn't be allowed.  Bandwidth doesnt cost what they're charging for it, I only wish that people in the UK had kicked up the same stink when our ISPs had the bright idea of implementing caps (they most likely got the inspiration from Australia, NZ and South Africa - where there were technical reasons behind capping people, internet was and still is a bit scarce round those parts)

When there are mistakes made, or worse rules deliberately bent to breaking point, they are covered up and not properly investigated. The IPCC is great but underfunded - they cannot investigate the vast majority of cases themselves (by vast majority I mean on the order of 99%). The rest are investigated by the force being complained about. 

As for Ian Tomlinson, that was a very extreme case, yes. But it displays a lot of symptoms of what is wrong with the police *generally*. There would have been no investigation at all had someone not recorded footage of the assault on their mobile phone. Whne it was reported the police tried to deny it. When the footage was released they tried to suppress it. Their version of events had no basis in reality. The first  post mortem was done by a pathologist already known to provide dodgy evidence (he'd been called on it several times and was later de-licenced for it in another case). The police would not have done any investigation had the IPCC not stepped in. When the IPCC handed the case to the CPS the CPS decided they needed to do their own investigation. They took so long over it that they concluded the only reasonable charge was assault, and the statute of limitations had passed on that one. No charges were brought at all over that.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"The saddest thing is that my mother (an educated, enlightened, intelligent woman) reads it.  Initially she'd read it as a ""guilty pleasure"", knowing not to trust anything she saw in it, but as the years went on, she got older, had more trouble keeping up with modern developments and the way the world was changing and as a result got subtly but progressively more paranoid and nervy, until now I frequently find her believing (sometimes even *defending*) things she reads in it.

I've literally watched my mother turn from the person who turned me on to New Scientist (back when it was less of a tabloid) into someone who reads the Daily Mail, sees terrorists behind every corner and *actually believes* (for example) that ""gay marriage will corrupt the meaning of the word marriage"", or not only that [Muslims really cared about](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1322435/Cafe-owner-ordered-remove-extractor-fan-case-smell-frying-bacon-offends-passing-Muslims.html) the smell of pork coming from an extractor-fan ([correction](http://www.khilafah.com/index.php/news-watch/europe/10712-pcc-clears-mail-and-telegraph-for-publishing-prejudicial-anti-muslim-story)), but that that single incident - *even if true* - would have any kind of statistical or evidential weight when forming a mental picture of Muslims in general.

She's still intelligent and thoughtful, but now her experience (the source from where we all draw our opinions, and the axioms we use to reason from) of race-relations, homosexuality, politics and foreign affairs is formed almost entirely from tabloid Daily Mail lies and agitprop.  When pressed, most of the stories or examples she gives are from the Daily Mail, and most are provably false.  Sadly, that means that no matter how smart she is, she can't easily spot the fallacies and inaccuracies that she's ingesting because she's existing largely in an current-events intellectual monoculture.

Worse, because it's such a habit to read it now (and she obviously [identifies as](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) ""a Daily Mail reader""), even when you point out how horrifyingly inaccurate the DM is, she tends to hand-wave away the examples as exceptions rather than the rule, or accepts its unreliability but claims she doesn't *really believe* what she reads... even seconds after she's just offered a DM-sourced claim as the truth.  Push her on the issue and she just [gets irritable and tries to back out of the conversation](http://philosophtly.blogspot.com/2009/07/cognitive-dissonance.html).

It's like watching someone walk a little bit of shit into their house on their shoes every day.  Each quantity is tiny, and has little over-all effect, but after several years of it *every room in the house is knee-deep in shit*.  And worse, creeping normalcy prevents them from realising that being knee-deep shit is a bad situation, and hence taking action to clear it out and return the house to a sanitary state.

She's a highly intelligent woman, and she clearly doesn't *think* of herself as ""someone who believes what they read in the Daily Mail"".  However, sadly, brainwashing works *precisely by* sneaking around and under your expectations, and altering your opinions and attitudes not with obvious, conscious, rational argument, but by slow, gradual, repeated, cumulative poisoning of [the reserve of experiences available to you](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic) when forming opinions.

The only good thing I can say about the Daily Mail is that - through the effect it's had on those I love - it's really brought home to me the concept and importance of informational hygiene - making a conscious effort to draw news and information from numerous different sources, compare and contrast them, and never, ever, *ever* allow yourself to get trapped in an informational monoculture.",0,1296651976,null,0,true,0,c1f62fr,t3_fdqtn,t1_c1f62fr,t1_c1f5y5v,1426736319,33,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,33

If the Daily Mail told us the full unsensationalized truth, they wouldn't be able to spread their Agenda. Their sources would provide a clear, even handed view of the story that wouldn't drive people to be Homophobic, Transphobic, Racist fucktards like the Mail want us to be. Because as Homophobic, Transphobic, Racist fucktards, we are more likely to buy their Homophobic, Transphobic, Racist paper.

Remember that transgender kid who the school said was going away as a ploy to reintroduce her back as a girl? According to a representative of the Transgender children's charity Mermaids (who kindly volunteered to go on the radio to give the child's family's side of the story) the story was that the School, not knowing how they could pull off having a transgender child once known as a boy being reintroduced as a girl without causing masses of controversy hatched a badly thought out plan to reintroduce the child not as boy x returning as girl x but as a totally new student. Sadly, this didn't work, the kids recognised her and an emergency assembly was called. The kids told the parents about this and, instead of asking the school what was going on, the parents called the papers, giving a oversensationalized shock story that was basically a half truth that missed out most of the detail.

The press didn't bother to talk or listen to the parents or the school, and the daily mail ran said story, missing the truth and portraying the child as some freak and the school as some overly PC institution pushing some evil agenda. The child stayed home but had to flee to stay with relatives under police escort due to death threats.

Now if the Mail was impartial, researched the story, researched what transgenderism was and actually spoke to people who knew what they were talking about, the whole senario may have gone a bit differently. People may have learnt a bit about transgenderism and how it's not some ""choice"" or mental illness but something that is treated by the medical community as a physical defect, how transgender people are in effect born into the wrong body through no fault of their own.

We would've heard an even more facepalm-worthy story of how a school cocked up dealing with a sensitive situation (in this case a transgender child) instead of trying to get some form of advice (which is readily available from groups like Press for change).

The education department of a local council would've learnt a valuable lesson in how to deal with a situation like this, there would've been a conversation and an increase in understanding about transgender issues and nobody would've had to send a death threat to an 8 year old.

But nope! The Daily Mail JUST HAD to spread panic about this story as if the headteacher of said school encouraged his/her students to piss on the Union flag.

You're assuming that you can tell them a false but emotive story, they'll run it, then it'll emerge that it's untrue and the Daily Mail will look stupid, right?  They'll be embarrassed for being taken in and we can laugh at their red-faces.

The thing is that what this article and even your anecdote demonstrate is that *they don't give a shit whether their stories are true or not*.  You can't prank them by reporting false stories, because they'll just lap them up, print them and our scattered criticism and occasional laughter will be drowned out by the sound of all the money they're making confirming the prejudices of blue-rinse housewives and racist fuckwits.  You can't embarrass them with fake stories, because *they aren't embarrassed by fake stories*.

Pranking the Daily Mail with fake stories is like arguing with a troll - you will never win, because *they're playing a different game to you*.  you think if you make a compelling point to a troll he'll give in and admit he was wrong?  Hell no, because *he doesn't care who's right*.  The entire point of the game is to wind you up and get you to respond, and no matter what you say, if you respond then you've lost.

Likewise, if you make up tempting stories that demonise minorities and flatter the prejudices of Daily Mail readers, you aren't embarrassing them because they happily make up similar stories themselves.  All you're achieving is - quite literally - *doing their job for them*.  You're playing the game of ""true or false"", but all they're playing is ""profitable or unprofitable""... and sadly, ""untrue"" for them is often closer to ""profitable"" than ""true"" is.

I understand the urge to strike back - [believe me I do](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/fdqtn/a_horror_story_reconfirming_why_the_daily_mail_is/c1f62fr), but you don't beat a prowling lion by throwing steaks at it.

The people who would recognise and laugh at fake stories in the Daily Mail already do so, because there's no shortage of examples already.  The people who don't largely wouldn't even acknowledge it if you held them down and rubbed their noses in annotated, sourced, cited corrections of the DM's output.

If you really want to hurt them, persuade people not to post Daily Mail stories on reddit, persuade them not to buy the paper, and debunk their bullshit at every possible opportunity - do your own small part to damage their reach, reputation, mind-share and profitability.

The problem here is *wilful misinformation*, and no matter how tempting it is, you don't ever make muddy water clearer by throwing more shit into it. :-/",0,1296660296,null,0,true,0,c1f6g87,t3_fdqtn,t1_c1f6g87,t1_c1f66hu,1426736497,39,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,39

We didn't blame the comedian tho, didn't even occur to us it was his fault. Still, when a joke that has most people laugh causes traumas in one person... I dunno.

My friend wasn't actually offended, not in that way. The dead baby jokes in some way triggered something in her, to do with miscarriages and a still born child, and it really really upset her. We both knew the comedian wasn't targeting her, didn't know about her experience, and would probably be mortified to know what happened. And neither of us want to censor anyone. But that experience, a good, fun night suddenly turning into (for her) several hours of weeping and feeling really shit, gives me pause for thought in this debate.

I don't have a simple answer here, and I don't want to remove any jokes. I just want to point out that 'being offended' isn't always about some Guardian readers sense of political correctness. It is (sometimes) someones genuine pain. Had I not been there I'd probably think it was all bollocks, but it did happen.

**WARNING: DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ""CHILDREN OF EARTH"" SPOILERS!**

&gt; Sacrificing one child to save 200 million (or the entire human race) doesn't seem like a choice.

Unless it's *your* child (or grandchild). Yes, I know that probably seems crazy and irrational to you, and it is. But it's also quite understandable to anyone with children. That's just how powerful parental (and grand-parental) love is, and it's what made the choice so wrenching for Jack --- as it would be for anyone in that situation. He knew what the right decision was, but he also felt horrible pain at having to do it.

&gt; Sacrificing your grandson to keep from having to sacrifice another, random, child is an interesting moral choice

No, not really. In fact, it would be a decision that would be very hard to sympathize with at all.

First of all, while it would still be awful for the one person whose child was sacrificed, it would be pretty understandable and forgivable for a person to save their child over another one. In fact, most people would be pretty shocked if that person *didn't*.

Secondly, it would be far less powerful from a narrative, dramatic perspective. Since the grandchild is a character we have come to know in the story and has a real humanity attached to him, the viewer would feel less empathy for the sacrifice of some random child who came in at the last minute, so it wouldn't *feel* like a difficult choice at all. It would, frankly, feel like a cop-out. ""Oh, look, I don't have to sacrifice the child I love, because PlotDevice Junior is here! Whew!""

However, if the other side of the scale is weighed, not by one child, but by *millions* of other children -- even if those children are not fleshed-out characters the viewer has developed some attachment to -- the moral weight of the decision comes across loud and clear.",0,1296673526,null,0,true,0,c1f7h3f,t3_fdq2e,t1_c1f7h3f,t1_c1f7ez5,1426736977,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The desire to protect one's own offspring is one of the most powerful emotional urges there is, and it can very easily lead one to irrational -- and even morally wrong -- choices. We can rightly condemn those characters for their selfish actions, but we can at least understand what motivated them.

But that doesn't compare to what I was saying. I said that it would be understandable and forgivable for someone to choose to save their child over another *single child*, which is the example you gave -- the way you think the final scene should have played out. Because it's understandable and forgivable, that would have had far less dramatic impact. It would have felt like a convenient plot device to save the character from a *truly* difficult decision.

But Jack had no such luxury. He was faced with a choice that any parent/grandparent would dread, and he made what most people would consider the morally correct decision -- what some would say is the *only* decision. But the moral correctness and inevitability of that decision did nothing to lessen the emotional pain, which is what made that scene so incredibly powerful.

This story is about a criminal who has lost certain positives (or whatever you wish to call them in jail), the fact that he is a rapist is relevant, however the ethnicity of his victims is not. The fact that he is black and raped white women is only mentioned as the Daily Mail know it will rile up the target audience. More so due to the fact that he is also an illegal immigrant.

You suggested earlier that if the rapes were being carried out against muslim women that your thread would not be downvoted.

wait a minute, from the comments

&gt;I wish to clarify the subject of Creationism in relation to our science curriculum. Department for Education guidelines state that they do not expect creationism and intelligent design to form part of any science curriculum developed by any state funded school that has the freedom to develop their own curriculum. However, they would expect to see evolution and its foundation topics fully included in any such science curriculum. Creationism will be embodied as a belief at Everyday Champions Academy, but will not be taught in the sciences. Similarly, evolution will be taught as a theory. We believe children should have a broad knowledge of all theories in order that they can make informed choice.

&gt;I would appreciate it if you could print to clarify for your readers.
Kind regards,

true,AlanCrowe,null,null,"There are two big problems with the article. 

The question of cost is a quantitative one. The author mocks concerns by framing them as concerns about subsidy

&gt; Electricity from wind power is expensive and subsidised by my tax dollah

He then makes this a yes/no question of whether or not there are subsidies.

&gt; My brother’s circumcision was subsidised by your tax money. Get over it.

But the underlying concern that wind power is unduely expensive goes unaddressed.

The second problem is with the authors misunderstanding of the concern that wind power is 30% efficient. Since wind is free, inefficieny is not in-it-self a problem, which should be a clue to the author that he is missing something.

He is missing the physics. The energy of the air flow is given by the usual formula 1/2 m v squared. Does this mean that the energy available goes as the square of the wind speed. Unfortunately not. The wind turbine is standing still and depending on the air rushing past. The mass of air is given by the density times an appropriate area times the wind speed. The wind speed comes in for a third time. Energy available goes as the cube of wind speed.

The underlying intuition about wind power is that calm days do not matter much because there are not too many of them. One is aware from day to day life that there is usually some wind, and, ignorant of the physics, one simply assumes that if the wind is blowing at half the design speed of the turbine, the generator will yield half as much energy; disappointing but not disasterous.

Unfortunately, when the wind is blowing at half strength the generator is only operating at 1/8 power. If the wind freshens, the power output will improve. To get up to half power requires that the wind blow at 79% of design speed. The controversy is not about calm days, it is about ordinary days, when the wind is only at half the strength of the optimistic figures used to justify the construction of the wind turbine. The claim that ""wind turbines are 30% efficient"" sounds like the mangled version of the claim that wind turbines are being justified on peak output figures but will only contribute 30% of that. The controversy lies in the widespread practice of quoting installed capacity figures in a way that leaves Joe Public in the dark and in for a nasty surprise when he finds that his tax dollars have only paid for 1/3 of the capacity he thought they were purchasing.

true,real_moxie,null,null,"&gt; I'd like to see Amy replaced with a character who is worthy of Rory's affection, rather than Amy being some sort of prize that Rory is lucky to have.

Definitely. It seems like one of the only things going for Amy is her looks. I've never found her to be a particularly *nice* person, just one who is used to getting her way (probably because of her looks). And that's fine, there's a lot of people like that, but it bothers me that she's supposed to be such a ""catch"" when I've never found her to have many redeemable qualities. 

At least Rory showed character growth over the course of the season. I think he always had backbone, and loyalty, and a great love for Amy, even at the beginning, but that showed even more as the season went on. On the other hand, I still don't feel like Amy had much character growth at all - she was still the same girl, more or less, as she was at the beginning. (And since I don't find her to be a particularly likable character, I find this all the more frustrating.) 

At the risk of downvotes, I'm still not sure if it's really Amy the character though, or Karen Gillan's portrayal of her. I still contend that at least Matt Smith and Arthur Darvill (and Alex Kingston too!) really embrace the characters, and are very much the characters, but to me Karen Gillan is just acting the part.

So even if Amy way supposed to have character growth, and perhaps be a little humbler after Rory died, I never particularly saw it.

Longwinded way of agreeing with you, but there it is. Rory needs someone who can respond to his character development and grow with him and the relationship, and not remain the stagnant female who is used to always getting her way.

You comment that the underlying concern of the undue cost of wind power goes unaddressed, actually it doesn't entirely and alludes to the unit cost reducing dramatically, but the point of the article is about dispelling the superficial stereotypes people resort to when there is no substantial objection other than NIMBYism.

You make the point yourself that the measure of efficiency is something of a red herring, which is rather at odds with the final point you make about Joe Public being led to believe they will get more than they do, which incidentally is not the case. 

Before any wind development is even proposed, never mind actually paid for and built extensive studies into wind patterns in that location are undertaken, obvious really, so the output is pretty well defined before anything is proposed.

true,unAdvice,null,null,"**WARNING:** This could get long and seem diatribe-y, but these are just my (incredibly nit-picky) thoughts. I still think that this is an **excellent** implementation and it's hard to imagine a better game being made for the Whoniverse (a GURPS adaptation excepted!), so consider my criticism largely academic in nature, from my perspective of a long-time RPG geekette. For *normal* people it is, as the Doctor might say, fantastic! :)

It's lack of depth isn't make-or-break - an RPG core set has to either give a brief overview of everything or choose to focus on one or two things (usually character generation and story elements) - and as a game designed for beginners, they chose the better option, especially as the story aspects are well covered in the show!

However, by only briefly covering everything, I get the same feeling that I get when a movie leaves itself open for a sequel - unfulfillment. Ultimately this feels like a beginner's box more than a core set, one that will eventually be replaced down the road by fully-fledged player's and GM's books.

For a specific example: much of the info on character creation is repeated in the GM's guide (though in more detail), and I can't help but think it would have been better to have those two sections rolled into one so that other sections could be much more detailed without increasing pagecount (like gadgets, ore even expanding the list of player abilities) They say they do this so that players have a 'rules-lite' version so that they can make characters quickly, but there's no reason that rules info couldn't have been added in a shaded box perhaps so that players could ignore the info if they so chose. 

Given my druthers, I'd have left out the story token sheet (or replaced it with a sheet of PC/NPC tokens) and got rid of the dice (It's great that they're going for 'ready to play', but how hard is it to get your hands on a few D6s?). Instead of that extra expense, either expand the GM's book or throw in a slim pamphlet that contains the generic 'how to run a game' info that every GM's book needs to have but every GM only ever reads once, thus freeing up more of the actual GM's book to be a gaming resource (this problem is not unique to this set of course!).

The production values are OK, I would have preferred hardcovers, but that's just personal preference and it would have drastically increased the cost. The box could have been designed a bit better - once you punch out the story tokens, you will never get the box closed again, so as a storage medium it's not great. The books are well laid out and clear enough (the focus of the rules is on collaborative storytelling rather than game balance), the odd typo and strangely literal interpretation of some of the Doctor's witticisms notwithstanding.

On the positive side, it's incredibly flavourful, and they managed to actually make it possible for one of the players to play the Doctor (or a Time Lord) without it absolutely breaking the game, and the rules are simple enough to play with kids as young as nine or ten. In fact it's kind of ideal in this sense if you have an older player to play the Doctor and the kids play companions.

**First Doctor**

* Meets the Daleks for the first time

* Leaves his grand daughter on Earth, in a future that needs rebuilding after Dalek occupation.

* Meets what may be a fellow Time Lord, the meddling monk, who has his own TARDIS.

* Is on Earth when the Cybermen first appear from Mondas, a 'twin planet' of Earth that is about to expire. Regenerates from exhaustion after this adventure.

**Second Doctor**

* Travels predominantly with Scottish highlander Jamie McCrimmon until his regeneration.

* Encounters Cybermen and Daleks in various adventures. The concepts of a Dalek Emperor (Davros first appears in fourth Doctor stories) and a Cyber Leader are introduced.

* Introduces the Ice Warriors, a race of Martian warlords (they are name checked in Waters of Mars).

* The Doctor teams up with UNIT, a combat unit dealing with alien threats, to fight the Great Intelligence. Meets the soon to be promoted Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.

* Becomes entangled in a plot involving a rogue Time Lord recruiting soldiers from Earth history. Gets in too deep and finally decides to contact Gallifrey for help, effectively turning himself in for stealing the TARDIS and leaving his homeworld.

* Time Lords fix the Doctor's problems and cut a deal. He will regenerate but be confined to Earth with his knowledge of time travel inaccessible. His companions are returned to their own times, only remembering their first meeting with the Doctor.

**Third Doctor**

* After a bout of amnesia, the Doctor makes a home with UNIT as their scientific advisor. The Nestene are the first threat he deals with.

* The Master comes to Earth, a renegade Time Lord that yearns for power over lesser species. The Doctor knew him on Gallifrey and has a begrudging respect for him. The two clash for most of the third Doctor's stories.

* Jo Grant, a UNIT secretary, becomes the Doctor's companion for some time before leaving to marry an ecologist. The Doctor is visbily heartbroken and gives Jo a crystal from the planet Metabilis Three as a parting gift.

* The Doctor is asked by the Time Lords for help after Gallifrey is attacked from an anti-matter universe by an embittered and exiled Time Lord, Omega. The first and second Doctors are plucked from their time streams to help out. On the success of this mission, the Doctor's knowledge of time travel is restored.

* Sarah-Jane Smith, a journalist investigating missing persons at UNIT, stows away in the TARDIS and becomes involved in a lone Sontaran's efforts to change Earth history so he can repair his ship. Sarah stays on as the new companion.

* The inhabitants of Metabilis Three, large arachnids, arrive to reclaim the crystal the Doctor took for Jo. The confrontation with their queen costs the Doctor his life. He returns to UNIT and collapses as the Brigadier and Sarah-Jane watch him regenerate.",0,1296874658,null,0,false,0,c1fjxly,t3_ffefy,t1_c1fjxly,t3_ffefy,1426742883,14,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,14

true,[deleted],null,null,"But immigration isn't solely beneficial, sure, it's beneficial to the business owners as they can use the increased supply of labour to drive down wages, and we don't need to expend resources in training our own citizens, but to the normal people it increases unemployment and drives down wages and working conditions whilst increasing house prices dramatically in areas with work, forcing everyone to lower their living standards to afford it.

But I agree with you that it shouldn't be an issue, ultimately there is no inherent difference between the people of different nations, as you say, we are all humans and these are just imaginary borders.

All the problems are ultimately the cause of the current economic system, as the increased supply of labour results in unemployment and lower wages for the workers rather than relieving the work burden on all. If we didn't have the immigrants here then eventually technological progress will allow the work to be automated and outsourced (via telepresence, etc.) anyway, so it's not the fundamental problem.

My point is that the things people are _really_ angry about - the unemployment, unaffordable housing, etc. are really problems of the economic system rather than immigration, and so instead we need to get people to realise this and call for change, rather than just attacking the immigrants as an easy scapegoat.

But pretending there is no problem at all is not the way to go. As that just fuels the anger as a growing number of people are left unemployed whilst the businesses lobbying for free immigration make greater profits. Ultimately the problems are inherent in global capitalism, and so already we can see the Conservatives resorting to nationalism and xenophobia to try and alleviate the anger, as though it would be any better if it were British people working in terrible conditions at terrible wages as the demand for labour is ever reduced by automation and outsourcing.

TL;DR: The fundamental problem is globalisation and automation reducing the demand for labour, but the capitalist elite cannot risk people seeing that the problems are inherent in the system and calling for change, so instead they resort to nationalism to try and suppress revolt.",0,1296904944,null,0,false,0,c1fl5wv,t3_ffqpl,t1_c1fl5wv,t3_ffqpl,1426743460,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Whilst I fundamentally believe in open borders and free movement of people, we have a number of issues.  Many of these are merely matters of perception and could be tackled by better information and less scaremongering, but others are deeper-rooted and some may even require genuine structural change.  There's the issue of population density (both national and regional); the related issue of net flows; the issue of rapid changes in local and regional demographics; the issue of the politicisation of immigration policy; the question of infrastructure at breaking point; the matter of how increased immigration disproportionally impacts the poorest and most marginalised and materially benefits the wealthiest etc. etc.

Full disclosure: I'm currently a British immigrant to Vietnam and have had long and interesting discussions with the locals here about their views on immigration, especially as regards whether us interlopers should be able to work, set up businesses, buy property etc. and what that means for them.

Then maybe we should be aimng to become these business owners.
I think the main problem is the education system. If people were given the skills to build businesses and thus make the most of automation of labour, we could all become part of the capitalist elite, we would all be wealth creators, and the economy would be driven forward. Which brings us to the same conclusion via different routes. It is the current economic system which is the issue. 


However, i am kind of pro-globalisation. I think it is these borders that help large corporations outsource labour.

Well, I support the global exchange of products and resources, I don't think we should revert back to isolationism and protectionism. But the movement of labour can never be truly free, because those people cannot afford to travel and live in other nations, etc. it is this concentration of wealth (derived from the private monopoly on the communal land and resources) that creates this effective slavery, as their only other choice is subsistence farming and the risk of starvation, and even that could be criminalised as the land is privatised.

Again, the problem is the economic system which is built upon the private monopolisation of communal resources, and the inequality that results.

Most seem to follow the same pattern; a group of friends get together and contact a well off organiser, who arranges transport, work and housing for them. Once here, they sleep 2-4 to a room and pay off the debt and rent from the organiser, while saving and sending money home. They work more hours than I'm am usually allowed to work and get less than minimum wage (it's less, because the agencies skim off money to pay external payroll companies, which they own).  After a couple of years they go back home after having saved enough to buy a decent house, which isn't much.

If they actually had to stay and get a house in this country, like the rest of us, they would demand more money. If they had to work as hard as they do for the rest of their lives, they'd work less hours and demand better working conditions. holidays etc. 

&gt; tl;dr is immigration actually beneficial (need sources)?

It is beneficial to those that employ them, and that's it. While here, they save money or send it out of the country, removing it from our economy. They get paid less and so pay less taxes. They force down pay for all unskilled work. They deny people that have to live here permanently a decent job, because most people cannot compete without having to forgo a family, live in a bedsit and die before retirement. Basically, they just enable the rich to become richer and make the poor poorer.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"From the top... Okay, now I know what your problem with my argument is. You're essentially saying I'm dismissing the possibility that immigration is a problem through reduction and dismissal of other arguments.

The reduced arguments I put forward were in my opinion not necessary to expand upon since they were purely examples of what I consider to be ignorance of the bigger picture and how immigrants are rendered as the scapegoat as there are other variables to consider, but on the whole, the blame is pushed onto immigrants. If it wasn't, we wouldn't be having this discussion. I'm well aware that there's two sides and I'm aware of the potential negatives and the positives to immigration.

I do not however, feel that my point relating to positive discrimination and political correctness was based on a figment of my imagination. I think even without the simplified arguments at the start that point would stand. If you feel that immigrants are being treat better than yourself, policies which favour them over you will cause problems.

I'll admit on the whole I could probably structure arguments better, but I wouldn't consider the presence of what you consider a straw-man that isn't tied to the next points in my argument to somehow indicate my entire series of points are incorrect.

The whole reason immigration is considered a problem is because there are a wealth of both positive and negative experiences/opinions relating to it. Communities feel they are broken up, workers feel their wages are driven down by cheaper labour, University graduates lately feel they are losing their graduate jobs to immigrant graduates, different demographics feel the government favours asylum seekers or immigrants for benefits and/or social housing... then on the flip side we have things such as a more dynamic range of foodstuffs and cultural variety in things such as entertainment or artwork for example, we have people who are willing to work the jobs that most of us would consider below us, we receive an exterior viewpoint to the systems that run Britain and we gain a more intimate knowledge of alternative cultures. We also are helping to spread a better understanding of the British culture back to their homes which is, whilst a long shot at making a point, perhaps good for foreign relations as well.

On the whole, evidence for and against immigration is more or less anecdotal; a mixture of ""I know someone who did this"" or ""A business near me does this"". Company policies and government policy can all be spun to be either negative or positive. We have a variation of qualitative measures and quantitative measures we can use to try gauge just what we think of immigration if we wanted, but it will never be representative of the whole population and the nuances of the impact of immigration everywhere.

I am of the opinion though that on the whole, immigration is a positive experience both culturally and economically. 

My end point to my first point in my original post was, basically, given the previous global nature of the British Empire and the cultures we brought in with it, as we are seeing sustained immigration the traditional British culture is perhaps adapting to accommodate the cultures of people despite the various resistances. I'd say it's a good thing as I said above, some may not.

I think there are a lot of people who are pretty poor and not very educated, and that quite often this means they don't have great lives. 

Obviously, a lot of these people are going to be legitimately frustrated and angry. But the problem is that often, because they're uneducated and don't have any responsible sources of information, their understanding of politics, society, economics, etc. is just fundamentally wrong. And so they don't understand the real causes of their poverty and their unhappiness, and think it has something to do with immigrants or the euro or something equally bizarre. 

Basically I think a lot of people are racist because understanding everything in terms of race is the simplest way to view the world. You can literally see race with your own eyes, whereas the real structures (economic and political) that actually govern our lives are much more elusive and harder to grasp.

true,fuf,null,null,"I kind of see what you're saying. You're saying that it's sloppy to allow the same word to apply to two very different things, which is true. I was wrong to say the meaning of the word changed, because it does still have its original (economic) meaning, it just has a whole bunch of extra (political) meanings as well.

I'm just saying you can see why its meaning got broader, and it's not like people are idiots for thinking it means anything other than corporatism. In the 30s and 40s Italy and Germany were called fascist states because they were corporatist states, but the ""war against fascism"" wasn't justified on the basis of defeating corporatism. After simple self-defence, the war was justified on ethical grounds by an opposition to political totalitarianism and to basing political ideology on race, and that's what ""fascism"" came to represent more than anything else. It took on a whole political dimension beyond just economics. 

Basically, any time someone uses the word fascism, unless they are explicitly talking about economic systems, it's pretty obvious they mean the broader political meaning. 

But anyway, I just wanted to say something about your argument for why the new meaning is bad:

&gt; What information does using the term fascism in this new manner communicate that cannot already be communicated clearly with other words?

The thing is we don't justify using a certain word because it communicates something more clearly than other words. Obviously any word can be replaced by a series of other words that mean the same thing. We *could* stop using the word ""triangle"" and replace it with ""polygon with three corners"" and the meaning would be just as clear, but it would be pretty inefficient. It's easier to just say ""triangle"". 

You can't argue against a particular use of the word fascism by pointing out that it can be replaced by other words, because any word used in any way can always be replaced by other words (that's what a definition is).

true,OldLeopardSkin,english,England,"Okay, I can't speak for every fascist (much as say, Clegg cannot speak for every liberal). But here it goes.  
  
**My view**: Genious is the only thing western nations have going for them, they cannot compete with third world sweatshops so they must lead in the technology sector. That said I don't think the economy should be export based either, since the whole recession thing was due to the fact that we are tied in with the American market.  
My main point is that mentally weak people shouldn't be born in the first place, things like Down's syndrome are detectable in the womb and the child should be aborted due to the fact that the likelyhood is, it will not be able to support itself and society will have to shoulder this individual without seeing any return. The mentally ""weak"" people who are smart enough to support themselves with a job and don't commit crimes etc. should be left unmolested and free to become the next Galileo. Degenerates should be punished, and conditioning should start from childhood to combat degeneracy (much the way religion did back in the day, but the definition of degenerate shouldn't be as extreme), no matter how smart degenerates are, they often end up representing their society (such stereotypes of black people always end up depicting the most degenerate blacks who as we know do actually exist (see: snoop dogg); I'm sure the Spaniards think the average Englishman is a football hooligan). Mentally weak people who cannot support themselves (think Lennie from ""of mice and men"") should be made to do easy manual labour and sterilised or if they are completely useless (i.e. vegetables) they should be humanely euthanised. 
  
**Nazi view**: Rather simplistic, Kill off the mentally weak, keep smart people for as long as they are useful to you, then kill them off.  
  
Case in point:  
*""I will have no intellectual training. Knowledge is ruin to my young men""*,  
*""When I take a look at the intellectual classes we have – unfortunately, I suppose, they are necessary; otherwise one could one day, I don't know, exterminate them or something – but unfortunately they're necessary.""*  - Adolf hitler.  
*[Action T4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_T4)*
  
**Italian fascists**: The Italian fascists didn't do much about the mentally weak, they saw everything as a struggle where the weak always lost, the fascists thought that if they were truly mentally weak then society would kill them off without any systematic slaughter, strengthening Italy. They believed that the intellectual (i.e. the man who only valued intelligence) was bad - as he can never be the model of heroic masculinity and action they loved so much, but that intelligence itself was a good quality to have.  
    
Case in point:  
*""Fascism combats not intelligence, but intellectualism which is a sickness of the intellect not a consequence of its abuse, because the intellect cannot be used too much... it derives from the false belief that one can segregate oneself from life.""*,   
*""the healthiest and most vital of them assert themselves against the weakest and less well adapted through conflict""* - Giovanni Gentile  
*""Book and Musket — Perfect Fascist""* - A slogan of theirs.

I never said they didn't deserve it. It's nothing against Theo Paphitis or the other dragon's personally. I don't want to take money away from them and I think they worked hard to get where they are.

I think there is an imbalance when business men make more money than people who save lives and benefit mankind. Usually this isn't a huge problem. Philanthropy can really help the world, look at Bill Gates pledging to give away so much money and all the Billionaires following suit. I just feel it gets out of hand when you have single people sitting on money that an entire city can earn.

Are you saying Theo has worked hard enough to be worth over 20 times that of a Doctor? Twice that of Stephen Hawking?

This is just speculation on the part of the MI6 guy's part. Plus, he never said what the mail are attributing to him, what he said exactly was:

&gt;“Should these extremists then decide to become suicide operatives, HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] intelligence resources, eavesdropping and surveillance would be hard pressed to find them on any ‘radar screen’.

They even falsified the quote on the left-hand side of the page. This is just bitchy wind-up drama designed to appeal to dopes, you should deeply question anything you read on that newspaper.

&gt;The official figures, which examine the ethnicity of those accused of violent offences in London, suggest the majority of men held responsible by police for gun crimes, robberies and street crimes are black.

I would imagine the majority of men held responsible for these crimes are lower class too, so what? Of what use is this information exactly? They're also probably have brown eyes, should we pre-emptively lock up all brown-eyed men? It's not unusual or surprising that immigrants make up a higher percentage of petty criminals than non-immigrants, just as it's not unusual or surprising that white, upper-class people make up a higher percentage of serious fraud and white collar crime such as fraudulent expense claims or insider trading. This doesn't signify anything except an inherent societal inequality that spans generations rather than some kind of genetic tendency to different forms of criminality. It certainly doesn't signify a ""failure of integration"".

Well you know what the biggest problem with ""multiculturalism"" is?

Organised Religion.

Yes religion. I mean think of it. We have the two biggest religions at each other's (and other people's) throats demanding special treatment to be utter knob heads. And I know, there are wonderful and kind religious people but or the most part organised religion has been a bane on society, in particular the Abrihamic one's. So here's an idea ladies and gentlemen, why don't we do something that is just as shocking and extraordinary as what Switzerland did with Minarets and Declare Organised Religion to be a form of mental illness?

I don't want to ban religion that would make as much sense as banning schizophrenia, it doesn't matter that the fancy piece of paper says it's banned, it will still exist. Like the mentally ill, I pity religious people. I pity them because they have been brainwashed into a way of thinking that not only causes society as a whole harm but also themselves harm. They believe that if they do something like find a person of the opposite sex attractive or eat the wrong food or do the wrong thing on the wrong day they will be punished by some great deity. They feel the need to treat people based on what some book written thousands of years ago says. They ""hear god"" and believe strange things that sound like something out of an LSD trip. You wouldn't you have some sort of pity you'd reserve for a schizophrenic or someone with PTSD? It's tragic, not abominable.

Yet, David Cameron is encouraging faith schools to open, some of them teaching things like Creationism and encouraging this illness we have dubbed religion. I have no problem with people believing in a sentient creator or an afterlife, it's just when people believe, hand on heart that said god will only let you into this afterlife if you follow the bible or the five pilliars and demands you hurt people and try to convert the, that it becomes, in my eyes at least, an illness.",0,1296954317,null,0,false,0,c1fnmji,t3_ffzbb,t1_c1fnmji,t3_ffzbb,1426744624,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

on topic: Extremist Religion is the biggest problem with multiculturalism, though to be fair without religion there would be no extremist religion. 

Note: by extremist religion I mean the people who knock at your door telling you about the wonders of christ. I think Christianity and Islam are the main causes for extremism, probably because they're the *biggest* religions. I have to say though, Christians knocking at my door and posting things through my letterbox saying that I'll go to hell if I don't repent and go to church have been more of an inconvenience for me in that last 3 years than any Muslim I've met.

Then again, I'd imagine there are considerably more Christians than Muslims in my area.

No, I don't. Research shows that differences in crime rates between different ethnic groups persist even after social variables are controlled for:

http://www.colorofcrime.com/colorofcrime2005.pdf (See page 11, 'Poverty and Crime')

Some interesting statistics:

**Crime Rates**

* Blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder, and eight times more likely to commit robbery.

* When blacks commit crimes of violence, they are nearly three times more likely than non-blacks to use a gun, and more than twice as likely to use a knife.

* Hispanics commit violent crimes at roughly three times the white rate, and Asians commit violent crimes at about one quarter the white rate.

* The single best indicator of violent crime levels in an area is the percentage of the population that is black and Hispanic.

**Interracial Crime**

* Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving blacks and whites, blacks commit 85 percent and whites commit 15 percent.

* Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. Forty-five percent of their victims are white, 43 percent are black, and 10 percent are Hispanic. When whites commit violent crime, only three percent of their victims are black.

* Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a white than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery.

* Blacks are 2.25 times more likely to commit officially-designated hate crimes against whites than vice versa.
Gangs

* Only 10 percent of youth gang members are white.

* Hispanics are 19 times more likely than whites to be members of youth gangs. Blacks are 15 times more likely, and Asians are nine times more likely.

**Incarceration**

* Between 1980 and 2003 the US incarceration rate more than tripled, from 139 to 482 per 100,000, and the number of prisoners increased from 320,000 to 1.39 million.

* Blacks are seven times more likely to be in prison than whites. Hispanics are three times more likely.

That's not inherently a risk with current GMOs, which only have a few differences from naturally-occurring species. The transfer happens, but no risk to human health or ecosystems with current technologies have been demonstrated.

For example, if herbicide-resistant traits from GM crops are transposed into indigenous organisms, what real risk to human health or farmers is actually present according to you? 

According to most scientific overviews, it's a minor issue that at most affects farmer crop yields on a temporary basis and introduces no additional risk to human health.

&gt;The British public have been exceedingly clear about their position on GM food

I agree with you, if people don't want it then government has no right to force it on them. I still think the public consensus is wrong, but it's their choice to make.

But their reasons for not wanting it are generally because they're uninformed about the technology thanks to the discussion having been contaminated by anti-science propaganda from loony green groups for decades.

For example, one of the major reasons that people opposed to GM foods cite is that they believe it's unhealthy for human consumption. This is despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting this contention and virtually all of it actually showing the exact opposite - that GM foods and their unaltered versions are substantially equivalent from a human health standpoint.

There is some scientific disagreement over the potential _ecological_ risks of _future_ GMOs, but pretty much none on the fact that current GM foods are healthy for humans. 

&gt;that's a terrible comparison [referring to my comparison to anti-vaxxers]

The banking crisis and bailout vastly increased our national **debt** and the massive public sector wages and pension payments form a big wedge of the **deficit** which is why we are having the cuts. Yes some of the deficit goes into **debt** interest payments, but not most.

Banking bonuses for this year were way too high. I would never say otherwise, however they were less than the amount the UK government borrow in a single month as part of our massive annual deficit. Yes we need to sort out banking, but even if we completely fixed it, we would still be left with a massive deficit to tackle, after public sector spending went up massively under Labour.

true,jaymeekae,null,null,"I do think multiculturalism in the UK has its issues. I am in support of immigration in the UK, and migration between countries in general. Mixing and intermingling of cultures is great but it does raise problems and cause issues within tight knit communities and these issues need to be managed.              
            
The main problem with multiculturalism in the UK is that there is a lack of integration. You can see in areas like East London that segregated communities have been established over the years. There is little to no encouragement for immigrants to actually involve themselves in British culture, or share their own cultures with us. If you arrive in this country past school age, it's entirely possible to go through life without ever really engaging with any ""native"" British person. I wouldn't class this as successful multiculturalism.                 
                
I agree that it's sad that you can't just throw a bunch of different cultures at Britain and expect everyone to play nicely, but it just doesn't work that way. There is resentment from people who've lived in an area for 50 years, when they realise their high street is full of people who look different from them, and speak a different language, and have a different background. Yes, that's racism, and it's shitty, but it exists in people. The thing is, I think it can be avoided.                               
                 
We need to look at ways we can encourage more integration and avoid the current self-segregation of communities. Things like compulsory english language courses for anyone arriving in the UK would be a good start. Community programs that encourage those who've been in the area for 50 years and those who have just arrived to intermingle would be amazing. I realise all these things cost money but I think they're more or less necessary if you want a successful multicultural society.                
              
Maybe over time things will improve (since kids are forced to mix at schools so as generations go by, there is less separation) but currently there are definitely problems and it's pointless to pretend they don't exist.

[This page](http://academicsreview.org/reviewed-content/genetic-roulette/section-1/1-3-bt-corn-is-safe/) references those studies, and explains in layman's terms how the researcher was in error:

&gt;Gilles-Erik Séralini claims that Monsanto’s data show that there are statistically significant differences between the control groups [normal corn] and those fed Mon863 [genetically modified corn from Monsanto].

&gt;One test of false differences is to see if groups fed different amounts of the corn being tested develop proportionate differences.  This of course is not true since differences that were observed at 11 percent corn in the diet were not observed at 33 percent, but more importantly, experts have consistently concluded that none of the differences have any biological significance—that is to say they would not harm the animals in any way.

&gt;One way to test if an observed difference is real or coincidental—a false positive—is to feed animals two different amounts of the corn being tested, usually at 11 percent  and 33 percent in the diet.  In this study, effects seen at 11 percent were not seen at the higher dose.  That’s a sure clue that they were false positives but Séralini counted them anyway.  Perhaps more important, expert pathologists studied the differences and concluded that none of them were biologically significant and none would have any adverse effect on the animal.

In short, his claims have been completely rejected as methodically and statistically flawed by most of the scientific community, and have not been replicated but instead repeated studies have had opposite results.

&gt;One major concern about GM is that it allows corporations to build agricultural monopolies

That's completely separate from (nonsense) health concerns, and separate from (possibly present) ecosystem concerns.

Conflating these concerns makes an argument less convincing, not more - because it gives the impression that if the health concerns raised are so easily dismissed then so are the claimed monopolistic practices of Monsanto et al.

My advise is to make the stronger argument instead of intentionally weakening your own position.

""Indeed, the Home Office report highlights that ""these percentages should be considered the maximum potential estimate of non-compliance, as the coverage for those leaving the UK and the focus of roll-call investigations mean that actual levels of non-compliance are likely to be lower"". MigrationWatch does not seem to have taken this caveat into account in its analysis – it has assumed that all of the ""potentially non-compliant"" are in fact working illegally.""

i mean, that's really basic. how do you feel about that? furthermore, if people are slanting figures to make immigrants look bad, what could their motive possibly be? if they are not relying on figures to justify anti-immigrant sentiment, what is the sentiment based on?

Counties aren't separated by economic disparities in the same sense as countries are. They provide a good counter example though; people and companies can move freely between counties, but are people in the north as wealthy as those in the south? Has it lead to wage equality?

&gt;it only creates a race to the bottom in developed countries. it would lead to increased wages in undeveloped countries, thus reducing the need for net migration from LEDC'S to MEDC'S.

Does it though? How much benefit do immigrants working in this country actually provide their own country? If you look at the economy of [Poland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Poland#Budget_and_debt) for example, from 2004 on it's difficult to tell whether they've seen any benefit. I'd hazard a guess that of greater benefit would be providing people with decent jobs in their own country, so they can spend money in their own economy and pay their own state taxes.

&gt; it is quarantining these separate states that enables large corporations to use the wage disparities to exploit both the working classes in LEDC's and MEDC's.

I utterly hate companies that outsource to other countries, but I can't deny the positive effect they have on that country's economy. I'm sure they do more to lift the economy of that country than the immigrants that come over here do. Both have a detrimental effect on the working class in the better off country though.

A better solution imo, and one that worked flawlessly after WWII, is state investment in poorer states. By taking money from general taxation, you are targeting income in a progressive way instead of disadvantaging the poorest. And by investing in the state of the other country, you are enabling it to build its own economy and provide its own jobs. You won't have multinational companies using their labour and sending profits abroad, and you won't have people working in other countries and depriving the state of taxes it desperately needs.

&gt; if open borders led to more uniform wages across the world, TNC's wouldn't be able to outsource our jobs to India for peanuts.

All very noble sounding, but flawed imo. If we ever did get to a stage where we had perfectly uniform wages across the world, states would compete for businesses in much the same way as they do with corporation tax, except they would be competing with their minimum wage and employment right laws. Companies would still want to move to wherever had the cheapest, most flexible and easiest to sack labour and there would still be downward pressure on wages because of it.

Nationalism and the like (i.e the religious and devout football fans) only serve to segregate. You are making a point to describe yourself in a way that you can identify other people that are similar to you.

It has been pointed out numerous times that blacks in the UK are creating a statistically higher than average crime rate - and that blacks are also much more likely to be victims of crime.

Now, in the past this was always looked at as a ""race"" issue and framed by the question ""are blacks predisposed to crime"" which is bullshit - and a straw man argument, it can easily be torn down. 

However, the fact remains that one ethnic group is committing a disproportionately high amount of crime. And the figures you provided indicate that blacks aren't even the worse off of all the ethnic groups.

So returning to the old ""poverty"" trope is as meaningless a waste of time as blaming it on racial characteristics.

I'm liberal, but I find it frustrating when other liberals are so desperate not to point the finger of blame at any group they always blame everything on poverty.

Consider this - the Chinese and afro-caribbean communities aren't likely at all to have militant Islamists in their midst - there are likely to be less radicalised  young men from those groups who go on to fund, or support terrorism.

Likewise, no Polish men are being accused of beating their wives to death for honour-killings.

We have to accept that all cultures have unique flaws and unique causes. But I would say there's an elephant in the room, and it is this: young black men are much more susceptible to cultural influences that tell them they must behave in a belligerently macho way with gang culture being a very strong influence.

I'm not saying that it's racial, I'm not saying it's the fault of the poor little kids who are brought into it - but there is something about the secondary and tertiary aspects of their culture that seems to tolerate or facilitate or is simply not strong enough to fight off the negative influences as well as say, Chinese or Jewish ethic groups.

The question of who benefits has been relevant to globalization. What do you make of this recent reddit?

http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/ewn79/hedge_fund_ceo_if_the_transformation_of_the_world/

Of course a country can't really fight globalisation on its own. The rest of the world carries on anyway. Unification of markets leads to a unification of governance.

The pressure comes from not opening up your borders when other counties have access to the labour the markets want.

Naked capitalism does not come cheap it has a cost in terms of social cohesion and quality of life.

As for the cultural question about immigration. I find that people of all backgrounds tend to cluster together. This creates boundaries between communities. You might say so what? But communities rely on shared identities to resolve all sorts of things - political power, justice, welfare. People are social and have a deep spiritual need to belong to a larger group. Feeling isolated and disconnected is unhealthy for anyone.

Its a complicated issue and I can't say I hear anyone who has resolved these post modern issues that the modern world has thrown up.

&gt;I just don't recall the British people being asked, ever, if they wanted multi-culturalism?

&gt;The nation's politicians, across the spectrum, have agreed to the arrival of millions of people who are not able to function in British society without millions of taxpayers pounds being spent on their specific needs. And now, at a time of economic crisis.

&gt;I think if politicians were honest about the mistakes that have been made, the absurd open-door policies of the past 15 or so years, then perhaps the average British taxpayer will fell less agrieved.

&gt;Much ado about nuclear nothings

&gt;The Telegraph has caused quite a stir by reporting that the New START Treaty negotiations require the United States to provide information on Trident II Sea Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) that the U.S. sells to the United Kingdom. Some folks have been up in arms about this, believing it to be a slight to our partners in the Special Relationship. While it seems like a pretty dickish move by the U.S., I don't see it that way.

&gt;Firstly, the language of the agreement in the document linked to by the Telegraph only requires the U.S. to report to Russia on Trident II missiles while they are in U.S. hands. Essentially, the treaty requires the U.S. to report and allow inspection of all offensive arms produced and maintained by both parties, including SLBMs. We have to report on each Trident II we make - why on earth would the missiles we make for the UK be exempt from that? I'm sure the Russians would just accept an ""Oh those? Those are for the UK. Don't worry about them and please don't look at or count them."" I know this is surprising, given U.S.-Russian relations over the decades, but something tells me that the treaty would be completely useless unless we gave them the details on our export missiles. Same, same for when the UK returns them to us for destruction at the end of their life cycle. We can't have the treaty at all (the overall effect of which is still up for debate) without this clause. Which was, apparently, in the 1991 START Treaty. There is no change in policy on this.

&gt;Our UK readers are probably thinking, ""That's all fine and good for you, but what about us?? This screws us!!"" Not exactly. Your new government has changed its policy on keeping its stockpile a secret and is moving towards increasing transparency on its nuclear weapons and policies. Since the UK uses SLBMs exclusively and you have a known number of submarines, the whole world knows you can only keep 160 missiles in operation at any given time. You also make your own warheads, so each missile's yield is still your state secret and not something we can know or share with the Russians. This clause doesn't change what the world knows about your arsenal, where it is, or how it may ever be used.

&gt;Bottom line is everyone needs to calm down. This hasn't changed anything that has already been ongoing for 20 years and no one's security is degraded by it. It sounds like the U.S. is screwing the UK, but a few minutes of reading reveals that we're not. The Special Relationship may not be as special as it used to be, but we're not stabbing you in the back. Well, in the New START Treaty at least. The other takeaway? Never take anything the Telegraph reports at face value. Ever. ",0,1297058350,null,0,false,0,c1ft4vr,t3_fgf5p,t1_c1ft4vr,t3_fgf5p,1426747276,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
