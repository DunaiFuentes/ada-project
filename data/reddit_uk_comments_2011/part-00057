It isn't that he was able to do this because the universe was ending, that didn't really factor into it (I don't think).  The answer is not going to mollify you either though.  The Doctor can see fixed and unfixed points where the viewer and (most) companions cannot.  That is the benefit of being a Time Lord, he knows when he can interfere in the time stream and when he cannot.

So the Doctor is able to go back in time to set up everything because he knows he's able to, just like he can't go back early and stop it all from even starting because he knows he can't.  This sounds like a lame excuse, because it sort of is.  But this is an established part of the Doctor Who mythos that has been built upon over time.  Moffat just used something that was already established so it's not really his writing since he's still working within the ""rules"" of the show

Technically, no, but practically, yes.  

If they're growing (and not just dealing) then they've got a lot more than buds to flush down the toilet.  I'm guessing it would take a dozen or so flushes to get rid of an entire plant, and that's assuming it was chopped up into pieces first.  Multiply that by however many plants they've got and it just ain't gonna happen.  Not unless the pollys are silly enough to come knocking on friday night and wait until monday morning to get the search warrant.

&gt; Also, for the sake of replacing a door, the amount of officers that will barge into your house who are being paid far outweighs the cost of a hinge, or if it's one of those plastic doors, then a new door.

Yeah, I take your point.  It's not worth the police's time to do things nicely.  It's no consolation for the old guy with the sunbed who had his door smashed in for no reason, but I think he was pretty cool about the whole thing: total respect for the police, just doing their job, luckily we saw the funny side, etc.

The first two weeks will be full of events designed to help you meet as many people as possible and you'll be surprised how great that is for your social life. Don't shy away from it, it might be intimidating at first but remember a lot of people are new there too and so you're not alone.

I didn't say you should ""love"" it when people abbreviate the title. I just suggested it might be a good idea to just let it go. Yeah, maybe some people unfamiliar with the show will think that, but so what? Who appointed you Defender of the Title? 

Of course you are allowed to like or dislike whatever you want.

A question would not be 'What do we learn about the education system from Hard Times' it would be more like 'discuss attitudes to education in Victorian times as evidenced through literature' meaning you could use both Hard Times and Jane Eyre - thus discussing embryonic state schools, orphanages, private education, girls v boys education etc etc etc.

The poetry, Chaucer, Shakespeare would be used in questions asking about the pathetic fallacy, metaphor, idioms etc etc although you could use any examples from any of the set texts you had studied. I don't recall being asked to do a direct compare and contrast between one book and another.

true,canonymous,null,null,"&gt;Does he physically lose ""life points"" every time he regenerates?

Maybe. It's unclear if there is still a limit on the number of regenerations a Time Lord can have, and whether or not that limit, if it exists, is culturally or biologically enforced. In Classic Who, it seemed as though there was a limit of 12 regenerations, but the Time Lords would sometimes grant extra ones as an incentive or a reward, which makes it seem as though they were artificially limiting the number for some reason. Now that the Time Lords are all dead, there may be no limit on the Doctor.

Presumably the flashy lights are a side-effect of the regeneration energy rebuilding the body of the Time Lord, and we know that it leaves some side-effects for a day or so [spoiler](/s ""#10 regrowing his hand, River zapping the Nazis"").

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Bloody hell, used to be £120 an oz for nice home grown sticky buds when I were a lad ;(

Oh don't remind me.  Over about 10 years the price rose steadily from 120 to 140 but the quality remained top notch.  And then, just like you said, it all went to pot (if you'll pardon the pun) about 5 or so years ago.  For a while you could still pick up for 140-160 an oz, but it was shit.  And then a few years ago the ""high grade"" came along at £10 a gram.  Compared to the shitty stuff at £160, paying £280  for the good stuff made sense because it lasted at least twice as long.  But now even the high grade stuff is now of variable quality.

It makes the idea of growing your own all that more appealing.  But I'd much rather pick it up from a shop legally and pay tax on it, given the choice.  I don't fancy that 6am knock-the-door-down call, especially now that I've got kids. 

It's so frustrating that I'm a grown man, a father, I run my own business, pay all my taxes, and in all other matters, act like a responsible and law-abiding citizen.  I've been toking on and off for nearly 20 years and I know better than anyone what effect it has on me for good or bad.  But still a bunch of interfering busybodies think they have the right to tell me what [God|MotherNature|Evolution]*-given plants I can and can't ingest in the privacy of my own home.

true,[deleted],null,null,"For a start, there's the [Doctor Who Podcast Alliance](http://doctorwhopodcastalliance.org/), which is an organisation of almost ALL the Who podcasts. There are a lot of of them, as you say, but that's a neat site for them.

My specific favourites are [Staggering Stories](www.staggeringstories.net) whose site also has some other fun stuff around (including a story written by me, if you can find it). These guys are the funniest group around, or certainly the silliest. They all get on so well together, and there's all these quirks they have around, so much fun. They review Who, plus sometimes other sci-fi shows. They also do commentaries, and have done one for most of the new series.

[The Flashing Blade](http://flashingbladepodcast.net/) is also awesome. Tony Gallichan (the main host, and co-founder of the DWPA) is a wonderful wonderful man. I could listen to his voice all day, and he's got the slightly barmy attitude of a man who could surely be the Doctor one day. Bob and Vicky are his co-hosts, and they all get on beautifully, despite (unlike the Staggering Stories lot) being in different parts of the country/different countries. They recently lost their original co-host Jo! (always spell her name with an exclamation mark. Always.) a few weeks ago, but if you look through their back catalogue they review old and new episodes with her too.

Finally, very quickly, [The WhoCast](www.dwowhocast.com). Also with that Tony chap and his good friend Not-A-Real-Professor Professor Dave. More serious show than the others, but they still have lots of laughs. Because DWO (the site that makes the podcast) is one of the biggest out there, these guys get interviews with writers and directors and actors nearly every week. Some really good insights, and exclusive access to those interviews too!

There are lots of others I like too, but this is long enough.

**TL;DR**: All three do episode reviews, and on a scale of silliness to seriousness:

true,ewokjedi,null,null,"There are parallels, but those are made patently obvious by the dialog at the end. So if it's a secret, it's a revealed secret at the end of the show. Ultimately, the similarities are somewhat skillfully emphasized at the end to highlight the interplay between the plot of the episode and the season's theme about the Doctor needing his companions and the companions sometimes (always?) making huge sacrifices for his sake. 

In other seasons, the emphasis is on the Doctor's need of companions to help him retain his sense of humanity. This season, the focus is more on a darker aspect of his need for their support. I think it all points to a hollowness that's central to the tragedy of his character.

What they are doing that is not related to spurs.
ways to masturbate or cock jokes. (I get that they are a close group of friends who have a lot of dick jokes... but after the third one it gets a bit repetitive.)
Too much talk about the scum.
I don't give a shit who retweets you.  I like twitter as much as the next man, but I don't need 10 minutes of talking about twitter.

Things I do like:
It's about fucking spurs.
Sometimes the talk is insightful.
They have a yank.
The attempted weekly segments.. the cab guy, killer, grandma etc etc


My two cents.. I listen to it weekly, and likely will continue.. my gripes are more or less minor annoyances, because at the end of the day these guys are bsing about my favorite club, and that is all that fucking matters.

true,TabascoQuesadilla,mcgann,McGann,"For the Eighth Doctor, I'd go chronologically.  I have them broken up into ""seasons"" on my hard drive, based on when they were released.  Here's the complete list - I've put an asterisk next to my favorites:

--edit-- I've added a ""Season 0"" for the ones that take place pre-*Storm Warning*, including the new Mary Shelley ones.  The Mary Shelley ones should probably be listened to after *Terror Firma*, but the rest can be listened to before *Storm Warning* with no problem.

**Season 0**

- *A Company of Friends: Mary's Story* (the other 3 stories are non-canon, unless you count the comics and novels as canon)
- *The Silver Turk*
- *The Witch from the Well*
- *Army of Death*
- *Shada* (animated webcast or extended BF audio drama; remake of an unfinished Tom Baker serial)

**Season 1**

- *Storm Warning* *
- *Sword of Orion*
- *The Stones of Venice* *
- *Minuet in Hell* (my absolute least favorite of all of them, by the way)

**Season 2** (overall my favorite ""season,"" I think)

- *Invaders from Mars* *
- *The Chimes of Midnight* *
- *Seasons of Fear* *
- *Embrace the Darkness* *
- *The Time of the Daleks*
- *Neverland*

**Season 3**

- *Zagreus*
- *Scherzo* *
- *The Creed of the Kromon*
- *The Natural History of Fear* *
- *The Twilight Kingdom*

**Season 4**

- *Faith Stealer*
- *The Last*
- *Caerdroia*
- *The Next Life*

**Season 5**

- *Terror Firma*
- *Scaredy Cat*
- *Other Lives*
- *Time Works*
- *Something Inside*

**Season 6**

- *Memory Lane*
- *Absolution*
- *The Girl Who Never Was* *

**Season 7** (technically ""The Eighth Doctor Adventures, Season 1"")

- *Blood of the Daleks*
- *Horror of Glam Rock*
- *Immortal Beloved*
- *Phobos*
- *No More Lies*
- *Human Resources*

**Season 8** (EDA Season 2)

- *Dead London*
- *Max Warp*
- *Brave New Town*
- *The Skull of Sobek*
- *Grand Theft Cosmos*
- *The Zygon Who Fell to Earth* *
- *Sisters of the Flame*
- *The Vengeance of Morbius*

**Season 9** (EDA Season 3)

- *Orbis* *
- *Hothouse*
- *The Beast of Orlok*
- *Wirrn Dawn* *
- *The Scapegoat*
- *The Cannibalists*
- *The Eight Truths*
- *Worldwide Web*

**Season 10** (EDA Season 4)

- *Death in Blackpool* *
- *An Earthly Child* * (Big Finish subscriber exclusive, not part of the EDA range, but it's important and definitely goes here)
- *Situation Vacant*
- *Nevermore*
- *The Book of Kells*
- *Deimos*
- *The Resurrection of Mars*
- *Relative Dimensions*
- *Prisoner of the Sun* *
- *Lucie Miller* *
- *To the Death* *

There are also three new ones coming out with Mary Shelley as the Eighth Doctor's companion, but I have no idea where those would take place.

Also, there is another subscriber-exclusive one that I didn't include here (*The Four Doctors*) because A) it's not all that good, B) it's more of a Fifth Doctor story than an Eighth Doctor story, and C) it's not important at all to the Eighth Doctor's arc.  I don't even know where to put it in this list.  (Though probably after *An Earthly Child*, now that I think about it...or *maybe* after *The Girl Who Never Was*.)

Finally, a DWM-exclusive (and very short, and rather inconsequential) one called *Living Legend* takes place between *The Chimes of Midnight* and *Seasons of Fear*.",0,1316837041,null,0,true,0,c2m6s65,t3_kp5jx,t1_c2m6s65,t1_c2m5qxm,1427640169,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Always struck me as little short of madness- particularly when I discovered that examination boards in other parts of the country (Wales, specifically) don't forbid taking the texts into exams, and that University English degrees at quite high-flying institutions (York) are assessed solely on the grounds of coursework- without a single exam.

1. My guess is that the prison takes the concept and/or image from the person's mind and projects it in the room. That is how the prison got the perfect fear because those college girls/the Indian dad/etc knew exactly how to act and say to break the people. So if this is true, all the angels were was a projection of Gibbis's concept of an angel, not a direct image of an angel. If those fake angels did have the same property of an image of a real angel, then all anyone would have to do is think of an angel and you would start turning to stone and such.

2. Gibbis's race is one of the most ancient and the most conquered in the universe. It would probably be in their best interest to know any of their possible overlords and the angels aren't that unknown across the universe. So it is possible that Gibbis would know them. As for why he is afraid, there is one main reason. Gibbis wants to be enslaved but doesn't want to die. His race will happily be ordered around but they would do anything to not die (Which is reinforced in many ways throughout the episode). Which is why the angels scare him, you can't stop, reason or weasel your way out. They don't want to enslave you, just feed/kill.

But the real reason why is that it was just a red herring for us to think it was Amy's room (explained in the confidential).",0,1316842556,null,0,false,0,c2m7blc,t3_kiq5v,t1_c2m7blc,t1_c2m4h9j,1427640415,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Is she more likely to be spouting out a random question to herself for no reason, **or** is she asking Rory a pertinent question about whether the Doctor has seen her most excellent display of violence, adding that he gets ever so cross - when he is known to despise violence?  

She also shows two displays of unrealistic ""TV hero vision"" in the scene.  She asks Rory the question without having been shown to see him (although she does finish the question looking at him, and they continue the conversation between them in the same tone of voice), and she shoots the Silent accurately without seeing it at all.  Neither moment is realistic, but both together at at least consistent.

As for referring to the Doctor as her old fella: Amy pointed out that River acts like the Doctor's wife within minutes of meeting her, plus they constantly flirt and bicker, and River is heartbroken a few minutes later when she finds she has just kissed the Doctor for the *last* time...

Initially, you'll be angry and upset and want your child back. But later on, you might feel like you weren't really bonded with your baby at all.

Yet she's still frantic about wanting her child back up until Let's Kill Hitler [remember the prequel where she calls the Doctor and she's like, ""I know who she grows up to be, but please find her""--or something along those lines? She still wants to be with her daughter. But in Let's Kill Hitler, she finds out that her daughter is also some other woman she had been hanging out with for something like twenty years... She probably assumes that she doesn't get to raise her and has reconciled with that.

But she still asks the Doctor to tell River to visit her if he runs into her.

I thought both Carroll and Suarez played very well. Carroll has started to drop back a bit to pickup the ball, and showed he CAN actually use his feet to pass nicely. This stopped our team from just hoofing it up to him. He should have scored one or two of his chances but overall I felt he was one of the best players on the pitch. Suarez did exactly what was expected, terrorized the Wolves defense and was once again the star. 

The biggest questionmark about our team is our defense. It still looks pretty shaky. A center defensive pairing of Carragher and Skrtl does not leave me with much confidence. Enrique looked good going forward and linking up with downing, Kelly did not have particularly good game but he is coming back from injury so it is understandable that he is a bit off form.

There are lots of credible analyses that demonstrate the massive potential for UK offshore wind, but here's a couple of starters:

* Offshore Wind: the Potential to Contribute a Quarter of UK Electricity by 2024. http://oro.open.ac.uk/8395/1/Wind_31-2-Boyle.pdf

* UK offshore wind, using less than a third of total available resource, could: generate electricity equivalent to 1 billion barrels of oil annually; create 145,000 jobs and provide £28 billion in tax revenues annually; make UK a net electricity exporter; avoid 1.1 billion tonnes of CO2 by 2050. http://www.pirc.info/projects/offshore/ + http://www.offshorevaluation.org/

Wind - and all renewable energy - creates more jobs per unit of investment than fossils or nukes while producing cheap, reliable, clean, safe electricity. Just about every country has worked this out and is now investing heavily.

Which sounds good, until you realise that ultimately it wouldn't impact the consumer's price much but would make middle-men and markets manipulators super rich.    

Electricity cannot travel great distances without incurring huge costs. So realistically you would put the electricity on the EU wide market and the market would magically decide the most cost effective thing to do is *not* to send it across the new EU smartgird and instead to sell it locally. Making the entire project a complete waste of money.

I think it's a bit more difficult to produce statistics about whether someone was under the influence of cannabis though. With alcohol you can just take blood samples and if their blood alcohol level is above a certain percent, we can say that they must have been under the influence of alcohol when they were driving. Cannabis though, as far as I know, has no such established threshold and I'm not sure how easy it would be to develop one. It effects everyone differently for starters, for example some people appear to drive better when they're high, perhaps because they pay more attention. Some people of course would have a massive tolerance through using it every day and while the amount in their blood may not even be noticeable to them, it might be a huge dose for someone with no tolerance and would impair them massively.

Kelly - 8. Had a difficult time against Jarvis, but did well, especially considering that Henderson didn't offer much support.

Carra - 8. Made a few mistakes, but mostly solid if unspectacular. 

Skrtel - 7. Was a bit reckless; however, he correctly judged that we were winning no headers in the midfield and pushed a bit up front to help out in that department and often made correct decisions.

Enrique - 9. Partly at fault for the goal. Solid otherwise. Some good passes to up front. Would still like to see him further up the pitch during the offensive phase.
 
Henderson - 3. Invisible. 

Adam - 7. Good going forward, didn't do enough defensively for me.

Lucas - 7. Silly mistake for the yellow, the sort that defensive midfielders simply must not make because they're in a constant danger of getting a card anyway. The goal was mostly due to his lack of concentration, in my book. Watch the replays before you disagree. He was supposed to mark Fletcher. But did well, still.

Downing - 8. I thought he was very decent; some of his crosses were excellent. Probably should have passed instead of taking the shot that Hennessy blocked. I still think he should be better at running with the ball and getting past defenders. 

Carroll - 8. Surprised me. Worked hard, won headers, was a constant nuisance and a very strong presence in box. Should have hit the back of the net with the chance he had. 

Suarez - 10. Some wrong decisions and some mistakes, but wow is he good.

Kuyt - 6. Was a lot better than Henderson defensively and exactly what we needed at that stage of the game. His offensive play was a disappointment, however; the 2 vs 2 counter attack of him and Gerrard was messed up by Kuyt's decision to come to the middle rather than stay to the right and stretch the defenders, ultimately leaving Gerrard with nowhere to go. 

Gerrard - 7. Wasn't on much, but he seems to be very, very sharp. Some of the passing and defensive play was excellent, and he seems to have lost none of the courage and determination.

&gt;You are bidding on a TomTom Go 700

&gt;This was my wife's, may her knicker draw be infested with the fleas of a thousand Camels...

&gt;The Go 700 was once the top of the range Sat Nav from TomTom, with an internal Hard Disk Drive instead of the traditional SD Card, and had full Bluetooth and Wireless capabilities.

&gt;I bought this for the back-stabbing harlot, some four or five years ago, before she met Nigel with the Little Penis, and it cost me over £400...
As bless her cheating little heart, she gets lost driving out of the street...perhaps without this she would never have found the way to Nigels door, nor perhaps his stain riddled bed...

&gt;Her infidelity was discovered when I took her car for an MOT, and while waiting, I was tinkering with the Sat Nav and noticed that all her recent journeys had all been to Nigel's...
So, like any normal human, I reprogrammed Nigel's address to one in a town far far away...

&gt;My wife bless her treacherous ways, didn't realise there was anything amiss until she was driving East along the M4.
She then tried to act all innocent and lying through her cherry red venemous snake lips, asked if I could sort out her beloved TomTom as something was terribly wrong with it: when she used it to drive to her sisters it took her along the M4.
I presume her sister means Nigel with the erectile problems...
With the anger of the betrayed I said I would, but my frustration and anger caused me to accidently delete all the files from the internal drive instead...

&gt;Words were spoken, accusations were made... The air hung heavy and was coloured blue with profanity...
I find it difficult to believe her claims that this is all my fault...
I wasn't the one getting lost while travelling to Pencil Dick Nigel's house...

&gt;After much arguing she has decided her future lies in the squallor of Nigel's cockroach infested hovell...
Good luck to them both... may the ten plagues of Egypt visit their stained adulterous bed...

&gt;I now have her TomTom Go 700 but have no idea how to reinstall the software, and really I don't want the reminder of the cheating, lying, heartless, creature of the night.
All the other accessories are still in her car, so I hope they are happy living at Nigels together.

&gt;Therefore this auction is just for the TomTom Go 700 itself...

&gt;I'm sure someone somewhere can make this work...

&gt;As an after thought...There is no returns for this...I really don't want it back...

&gt;The auction Starts at a low but fair £20 and all proceeds will go to taking me out on a bloody good night with copious amounts of alcahol, wine, women, and song...and if the price is right...maybe a curry to boot...

&gt;So please bid with confidence that all proceeds are for a very worthy cause...

&gt;Good Luck

If anything it is like reading the longest book ever and having that feeling of needing to know what will happen next never subside.

Sure he saves the universe time and time again, but he also destroys race after race.  The best part is that the Doctor is fully aware of this, and he never tries to but himself in the shoes of a god. Up until Water on Mars we never really saw the dark side of the Doctor.

true,PSquid,colin-baker,Colin Baker,"There's only one, but she has one hell of a twisty timeline from our point of view. I'll try to put it into order here (if I get anything wrong, feel free to correct me, and I'll edit it in).

So, from River's point of view, things happen in this order:

* She's born, as Melody Pond, and raised by a captive Amy for a short while, before being taken away to be brainwashed, apparently in 1960s America. (End of The Rebel Flesh through to the end of A Good Man Goes To War.)

* She starts calling Nixon because she's scared. Once the TARDIS team find her, she's shot by Amy, ~~and thus shortly afterwards~~` `^1 and ~~an unknown amount of time~~` `^2 nine months later, regenerates into Mels. (Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon, though we don't actually get confirmation that it was Mels she regenerated into until Let's Kill Hitler.)

* She grows up with Amy and Rory, forces the Doctor to take them to 1930s Germany, is shot by Hitler, regenerates, poisons the Doctor, finds out her name is/will be River Song, saves the Doctor, is left with The Sisters of the Infinite Schism (with a shiny new diary), and starts on her way to becoming a professor of Archaeology. (Let's Kill Hitler.)

* She graduates as a ~~professor~~` `^3 doctor of Archaeology, shortly before being re-captured by Madame Kovarian and the Silents/Silence. From there, she is placed in the space-suit, and placed into Lake Silencio, ready to kill the Doctor. (End of Closing Time.)

* She is locked up in the Stormcage Containment Facility for killing a good man, seems very likely now that it's the Doctor. (Between episodes.)

* She's visited by Rory, asking for her help at the Battle of Demon's Run, but refuses, only to turn up at the end, revealing that she couldn't, because she _is_ Melody Pond. (A Good Man Goes To War.)

* She receives her blue envelope from the Doctor, and goes to Lake Silencio, where she sees the astronaut (probably herself) kill the Doctor, ~~though she seems unaware it's probably her~~` `^4 . She goes on to help the Doctor in defeating the Silence. (The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon.)

* She's a part of the events revolving around the opening of the Pandorica, and also gives Amy her diary in the rebooted timeline, so that she remembers the Doctor, and he comes back. He returns the diary to her after the end of the Ponds' wedding. (The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang.)

* She is let out of Stormcage temporarily, in order to help with the events surrounding the crash of the Byzantium. (The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone.)

* She becomes a professor of Archaeology` `^3 . Either before or after that, but still in this segment of her timeline, the Doctor takes her to Darillium to visit the Singing Towers, and gives her the upgraded version of his screwdriver. (Between episodes.)

* She goes to the Library, where she defeats the Vashta Nerada alongside the Tenth Doctor, and finally sacrifices herself in order to enable the Library computer system to bring back everyone who was saved. Her consciousness is uploaded to the library computer, and she ""lives"" on in there, for the rest of her life as far as we know. (Silence in the Library/The Forest of the Dead.)

TL;DR: Her timeline is _very_ wibbly-wobbly, and pretty timey-wimey.

&gt;*Post your PayPal email address and I'll send you a couple of bucks for a beer. I'm sure others would be happy to send a buck or two to help you try and kill the brain cells and forget the wench*

&gt;A really nice thought.. but really I don't deserve that accolade...
&gt;Instead anyone who feels similar make a donation to 
**Cancer Reaserch or Heart Disease Research**
both are worthy causes

&gt;Maybe some good will come from this listing...

When the doctor asks the question, ""why do you want to kill me?"" and they answer, ""because you are a terrible, violent, destructive force,"" he agrees and decides not to fight because he's so defeated by now. 

The Silence are a religion and they have strict moral codes. Once the doctor lays down his sword, so to speak, they may refuse to aid in his destruction. When their sect is fallen, there is no Silence on the hill behind them, in view of Astronaut River.

Because there is no silence, Astronaut River is now able to remember the act of killing the doctor. Because her future self is standing on the beach, she gets a sudden memory of this right in time and is able to step in to prevent it, knowing *exactly* what to do because she's already done it. Timey wimey. 

The Doctor then peaces out for his Christmas special, taking Astronaut River with him and they get married. Her story is over and we don't see her again next season. Future River, Amy, and Rory all continue with their lives, meeting past Doctor just like they did, and pretending to not know anything about his future, just like they did anyway when he died. 

Nothing in the timeline is disrupted and we get a nice montage of the Doctor and River being romantic. The episode ends with the hint of a mystery and the promise of more to come. We meet a new companion in the Christmas special, who may or may not stick around for season 7.

We know that the following day is d-day, so less then 24 hours remain....

Amy and Rory are shown to be in England the previous day(?) and obviously have not had the envelope yet (unless they were shopping for the trip but they were too carefree for that i think).

River is confronted by the silence 5000 years in the future as she graduates as a Doctor of archeology, presumably put in a spacesuit and sent back to the past ( the time might be wrong here, im sure someone can correct/verify).

With all the wibly wobbly going on why give craig the line about using up the last remaining time cleaning the house?

The date is fixed as we learn about it in Lets kill hitler from the time traveling shape changing robot people.

The song is old and the girls in the doll house were singing it and now appears to be prophetic about the death of the doctor.

I haven't a clue where this is going, somehow the date is significant and fixed as earths timeline and the Doctors timeline are converging....

&gt;Welp, this is /r/doctorwho where only fools express criticism so bring on the downvotes.

Seriously, there's nothing that makes people want to downvote more than this.  Its hugely irritating and against the reddiquette. 

&gt;but why did Alfie's voice begin to broadcast anyway? 

Because they were monitoring the store and babies are *loud*

&gt;If the Cybermen are so susceptible to a baby's cry, why wasn't that enough to stop them from converting billions of people before?

Cybermen aren't susceptible to a baby's cry, as I understood it.  But Craig was, and as he was at that point hooked into the Cybermen, his emotions spilled over onto them.  And as has been established before, emotions + Cybermen = Bad times.

&gt; It could have even been redeemed if the Doctor showed more emotion because of the danger that he brings to those around him.

I don't think that was the point that was being made.  Yes, the Doctor felt that at the beginning, but I think its about how the people around him are better off.  That was hammered pretty heavily with the whole ""I'm sticking with you because its safer"" and the Doctor telling him he believes in him contributing to him overcoming the Cyber-conversion.  And the whole exiting with a smile and ""I was here to help"".  *That* was the revelation.  

&gt;Lastly, if they give River the astronaut suit because they heard that's what she was wearing when she kills him, where did the idea even come from? Why an astronaut and what's so impossible?

The difference it seems is that the wind farms get more because they're subsidised.

I believe that wind turbines have to be stopped during times of very high wind (such as when the UK got the tail end of Hurricane Katia the other week) because they could be damaged

I think i have it figured out:

1) After TGC, the Doctor drops Amy and Rory off at a new house with a new car.

2) After Closing Time, the Doctor travels back in time to lake silencio and sends the blue envelope

3) 2 months after TGC, Events of the Impossible Astronaut (Amy and Rory in thier new house get the letters. The Doctor presumably interferes with Amy's career as a Model/Fragrance person since she wouldnt have time to pursue a career in that field. Basically the Rory/Amy in Closing time is some Alternate Amy where the Doctor did not contact them.). Possibly Could be Retconned by the Wedding of River song.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5) Something weird happens to Rory and Amy's memory where they do not remember the events that follow even though they were dropped off back in time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Events of the Day of the Moon

5) Events of the Doctor's Wife [although does it really count? they had to literally leave the universe for neil gaiman to write the episode]

6) Events of Rebel Flesh/Almost People

7) Good man/LKH

8) Night Terrors

9) TGWW

10) TGC, After these events the doctor drops them off back in time

11) Closing Time, takes place a few years later (b/c Alt Universe Amy is now a famous model/fragrance person as the doctor is much older when he dies.)

""Russell [T. Davies] reckons it's all about parenthood with me,"" he smiles. ""It's his view that every writer has one story that they go on re-telling and that being a father is mine.

true,darthjoey91,dalek,Dalek,"Here is the story of the Doctor and The Big BAD WOLF. Aimed at very young kids, with liberties taken.

Once upon a time, there was a Doctor. He was young and old, skinny and fat, and short and tall. He wore suits, scarfs, hats, celery, and carried a screwdriver to help people. He also had a magic blue box. This magic blue box was also a space ship and a time machine.


One day, the Doctor met a girl named Rose. Some mean people were attacking her and he saved her. He offered her a ride in his magic blue box. He showed her new worlds, the past, the present, and the future. Along the way, they saved people from monsters. They fought spiders, ghosts, trash cans, and zombies, as well smelly monsters, hungry monsters, and flying monsters.

On one such adventure, the Doctor was trapped by some of the trash can monsters. These monsters were especially terrible because they wanted to hurt everyone everywhere. Rose wanted to help the Doctor, but stranded far away from him with the magic blue box. She wanted to help him so bad because she was in love with him. She tried to use the magic blue box to go save him, but couldn't get it to work. She pushed every button and pulled every lever, but nothing happened. Eventually she started to cry.

When she did, one of her tears landed on the control panel and the magic blue box came to life. It promised to help Rose, but in order to do so, she would become a big BAD WOLF. Rose would've done anything to save the Doctor, so she became a big BAD WOLF.

After becoming a big BAD WOLF, the magic blue box carried her off to save the Doctor. When she got there, the BAD WOLF ate the trash can monsters, making them never able to hurt anyone anymore. She ate so many of them that she made it so that hadn't hurt anyone, especially a man named Jack Harkness.

When the Doctor saw that Rose had become a big BAD WOLF, he knew that he could change her back. The Doctor kissed the big BAD WOLF, and she changed back into a girl again. Unfortunately, because of the cooties that wolves have, the Doctor was hurt, but when he got better, he was David Tennant, and all was well.

The comments here are more mature, and i agree with most of it.

* Carroll is a bit unlucky not to score, he had so much chance for me.
* Suarez was brilliant as always, Causing all sort of problem for opposition defences.
* Downing looks more speedy than the previous game making the game more exciting.
* Hendo didn't do much, lacking in tracking back and link up with the rest. BUT theres always room for improvement.
* Lucas did a solid performance, just need to improve on the tackling.
* Adam did so much better in this game, more accurate passes and better defending.
* Enrique contributes quite alot on the left wing with pretty accurate passes and dribbling.
* Skrtel just need to be calmer and learn to tackle with more technique.
* Carra as usual a bit slow to mark, but did reasonably well.
* Kelly was solid, considering hendo didn't track back to help sometimes.
* Reina did a good job as always, pretty good saves apart from the wolves goals.

If you honestly believe that 6 players on Arsenal (who got beat by us, hammered by ManU, and embarrassed by Blackburn) deserve ATLEAST .10 better than our number one best rated player I think you need to reconsider your thoughts.

If you have watched this season so far, there's no need for a spoiler tag, as all this has been revealed this season: River is surrounded by silents who are brainwashing her against her will; they can implant a subliminal suggestion such as ""you should kill everyone of us"" and you do it. You can't see/remember them unless you look at them.

River (and presumably one or more silents) is in the TARDIS and she can't control it (i.e. ""Tell the Doctor you have lost control of the TARDIS"", ""Tell him someone or something has taken over by remote control"", ""Pilot the TARDIS here""). 

River is genuinely frustrated the TARDIS won't respond to her (afterall, she doesn't recall being told to fumble with the console). She tries to escape after linking a couple of cables together, opens the doors to find herself against a wall, and says ""I'm sorry, my love"". The TARDIS explodes through every point in time, and the Doctor still survives.

Of course something else could have happened, but I think we have enough evidence from this series to  figure it out. It just hasn't been presented on screen.

What I'm still waiting for is the red end of the sonic screwdriver, the dampeners, and of (hopefully) learning that the silents perished in the library after being made a snack of by the vashta nerada.",0,1316938036,null,0,true,0,c2mf2k2,t3_kqm6a,t1_c2mf2k2,t1_c2mem39,1427644135,13,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,13

In Caves.. the Doctor is put in the middle of a complex tangle of social, economic, and political upheaval on two worlds killing their own over a drug that slows aging. I think the story is much more complex than any of the stories you listed, and it's more plausible relying on the hatred and paranoia the antagonists have for each other to drag the Doctor through this place where everyone is a villain not against the Doctor, but each other. The entire story is basically a metaphorical house a cards collapsing on top of the Doctor and Peri, and one of the darkest classic episodes in that era.

&gt;In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is also defined as its weight per unit volume. . .

EDIT: Nevermind. Just cause it's the densest material in the universe doesn't mean it's the heaviest:

&gt;The density of granular material can be ambiguous, depending on exactly how its volume is defined, and this may cause confusion in measurement. A common example is sand: if it is gently poured into a container, the density will be low; if the same sand is then compacted, it will occupy less volume and consequently exhibit a greater density. This is because sand, like all powders and granular solids, contains a lot of air space in between individual grains. The density of the material including the air spaces is the bulk density, which differs significantly from the density of an individual grain of sand with no air included.

Plus it is quite obviously made by a fanboy which I very much appreciate.

I thought it was bang on in terms of visuals, everything from the camera work to the sets to the 'creature' special effects and the 'other' sequences was just sheer eye candy. Hope they manage to stick with this and not step over into the realms of bad cgi. I felt it had a good balance when it came to horror (at least one scene will make the average viewer cringe) versus action and thankfully isn't fully of gobshite hoodies or OTT teen angst which I thought it might be after seening the trailers.

It was let down a little by being confusing to start off with and tended towards information overload but this I think was just due to them setting up the story lines and introducing the characters. Hopefully the pacing will drop back a notch or two to a less frantic level with the coming episodes.

One thing though, an I know this is prob just me but it REALLY bugged me that the guy who was also in Pyschoville spoke and behaved more like a child of 10 -12yrs old when we know he's is actually 17-18yrs old.

true,Banjo-Fella,null,null,"I've been trying to figure this out too, and it has me so, so confused! I don't think it can work in the way you suggested, because wouldn't Amy and Rory be stuck in a temporal loop?

They would be dropped off by the Doctor at the end of TGC, they'd receive a mysterious summons to America, would go on multiple adventures with the Doctor, during which Amy would give birth to Melody, and then they'd be dropped right back at the start of this sequence, with no way for them to escape from it. So, surely that can't be it?

The order of the episodes probably describes the order the Doctor experiences the events in. So, what does the series look like from Amy and Rory's perspective? I think it could be something like this:

A Christmas Carol -&gt; Night Terrors -&gt; The Girl Who Waited -&gt; The God Complex -&gt; A break during which Amy becomes a model -&gt; Amy is kidnapped by the Silence -&gt; The Impossible Astronaut -&gt; Day of The Moon -&gt; The Doctor's Wife -&gt; The Rebel Flesh -&gt; The Almost People -&gt; Amy gives birth to Melody -&gt; A Good Man Goes To War -&gt; Let's Kill Hitler

This would explain why the Doctor seemingly ignores Amy's need to rescue baby Melody, and instead goes gallivanting around Apalapucia, and so on. I still feel this isn't right, either. Maybe it's too complicated... maybe the Doctor and the Ponds experience the events in the same order, and the end of TGC is the second time he split up with them.

I could be totally missing something, so let me know if I am. But things like this really irked me after rewatching the ep today.

Having said that, I'm coming around to believing that Redknapp might have quite a bit more Billy Beane in him than I gave him credit for:

In the past few years, Arry has taken a good number of cheaper players, and extracted pretty amazing performances from them, particularly with acquiring the likes of van der Vaart (who would forever ride the bench at a United or Real Madrid), but gets lots of first team playtime and European action with Spurs.

I think Adebayor's hiring is awfully similar to that of David Justice's transfer to the Oakland Athletics (where a player was deemed to be unusable/past their prime, and the original club paid a majority of the wages just to clear some space on the roster, and the new club is able to extract just a few more great performances from that player).

Moreover, Scott Parker, who was on *nobody's* radar, was a bargain hire and has, so far, turned out some amazing performances for the club.

Unsure about this year's numbers, but last year, our total wages were almost [half](http://www.footballticketsonline.co.uk/top-five-wage-bills/) that of the Arse.

Moreover, we've got one of the lowest [cost-per-point](http://www.epltalk.com/revealed-the-premier-league-table-thatll-make-you-go-hmmm-31868) ratios in the Prem.

First place this year? Nah, our wage structure makes that impossible, but Redknapp and whoever's running the show on the ground seem to be doing a damned good job of finding talent, not paying a heck of a lot for it, and extracting amazing performances out of it.

But what strikes me as being more interesting is that many of the things you liked about the ep are things I hated. The everyone's-a-villain aspect is very bothersome. If there's one thing I like about the Doctor, it's that he likes humans rather a lot. And there's just nothing to like about us here. This is the worst of humanity: no one learns a lesson, the bad guys--or at least one faction of them--win, and the episode ends with a pile of corpses for whom I feel almost no sympathy. It's dark, but I'm just not seeing where that makes it good.

Almost as disturbing is the house-of-cards problem. The Doctor is completely lost in what looks--to me, at least--like a pretty minor interstellar trade dispute. I know I've been spoiled by massive, cosmos-ending finales in the RTD era, but surely Five has gotten through worse than this completely unscathed. Any encounter with the Daleks ought to be much more dangerous than this. 

Of course, your last reason is the one thing about the episode I loved, although the sacrifice, again, felt sort of lacking, since I don't understand why the Doctor is such a hapless victim of everyone he comes across in the story. 

Anyway, thanks for the answer.

Today we held a silent and visual protest against the criminalisation of the Celtic support, both from the ‘Offensive Behaviour at Football…’ Bill and the disproportionate policing that we and the wider Celtic support currently face.

While the new legislation will likely have a direct effect on our group – particularly as the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland are demanding that it specifically refers to banners and displays – it extends beyond just us and all Celtic fans will be affected.

The proposed new legislation denies football fans the right to freedom of expression and treats us all completely differently from others in society. This is despite there being very little disorder at football matches – and certainly far less than at music concerts or at bars and clubs around the country.

It comes on the back of a season when our manager was attacked by bigots because he comes from an Irish nationalist background. The response of the politicians has been to draft a law that, according to Justice Committee chair Christine Graham, is designed to target the Celtic support for our Irish identity and for singing songs in support of Irish nationhood. It looks like the bigots have won.

The protest was a massive step for our group to take. We want nothing more than to back our team for 90 mins and give them our support, especially on the back of defeat at Ibrox last week. But we feel this issue goes far beyond one half of football and that if the Celtic support doesn’t begin to influence the debate around policing and the new law then we, like many other Celtic fans won’t be there to support the team – we’ll be banned and possibly jailed.

In many ways, though, this is already happening. We currently have three members awaiting trial for ‘offences’ committed at the first game of last season. Their alleged crime was holding a a banner that, days later, bigoted elements of the Scotland’s Shame support complained about after seeing on the internet. The case has been doggedly pursued by the Procurator Fiscal, who has appointed a Fiscal more used to murder trials to take charge of the prosecution. We’ve also had members and others in section 111 arrested on made-up charges and instantly banned from every game in Scotland while their case drags on through the legal system – the police don’t even need to consult the courts to do this now.

At every match we’re filmed constantly and subjected to petty intimidation, like strange police officers greeting you by your first name. And it’s not just us – at every away match the police are filming fans coming off buses, in pubs and at stadiums and fans are given full-body searches at grounds. At the recent home game with Motherwell a fan was arrested and dragged out of the main stand by several police officers for singing ‘go home ya huns’. Fans arriving home from Sion in the early hours of the morning were greeted by a welcoming party from Strathclyde Police, there to say hello and take their pictures.

The time has now come for our club to stand up for our fans and use their considerable influence and voice to defend us from disproportionate policing and discriminatory new laws. It is also time for the support to come together and oppose policing and laws that seeks to silence us and treat us as part of a problem that, if it exists, is not of our making.

We won’t roll over to a political agenda that seeks to criminalise us and we call on all fans and fan organisations to join us and protest against the criminalisation of the Celtic support.",0,1316958995,null,0,false,0,c2mfzwx,t3_kqf3c,t1_c2mfzwx,t3_kqf3c,1427644575,5,false,Glasgow_Celtic,t5_2rgo4,5

Tick tock goes the clock And what then shall we see? Tick tock until the day That thou shalt marry me 
Tick tock goes the clock And all the years they fly Tick tock and all too soon You and I must die. 
Tick tock goes the clock, we laughed at fate and mourned her Tick tock goes the clock, even for the Doctor
Tick tock goes the clock He cradled her and he rocked her Tick tock goes the clock Even for the Doctor...""*

Here's what Kovarian and the children at the end of CT said:

*Tick tock goes the clock and all the years they fly, tick tock and all too soon your love will surely die
tick tock goes the clock 'till river kills the doctor*

and furthermore, here's what the prequel to TWORS sang:

*Tick Tock, Goes the clock, Tick Tock, Goes the clock,
Tick Tock, Goes the clock, Doctor, Brave and Good,
He turned away from violence.

The falling of the silence*

Just because time travelers remember she existed doesn't mean she ever did. As far as the universe is concerned, she didn't. There never was anyone there *to* die. In that moment in Rory's and The Doctor's life they saw someone who was about to blink out of existence. But once the TARDIS spins up, that was fiction.

As for number 2, it's a running gag.  It's supposed to be funny.  It's not all the time.  For examples I present: The Doctor's Wife and The Almost People/The Rebel Flesh.  Additionally, he's making judgements based on the information he has at the time.  He always does this.

He knows that things don't add up, but he doesn't have enough information to come up with a better theory or suffers from confirmation bias.  He was wrong because he didn't conceive of the Cyberman ship having crash landed.  For The God Complex, the room presenting people's fears would make the idea that the monst feeds on fear a reasonable conclusion. It's only when he notices the minor detail of faith that he fully understands.  In the Girl Who Waited, he actively lied and made it look like he was making a mistake.  For Night Terrors, even the Sonic told him the problem was the cupboard and not the boy.  It wasn't until he saw the photo album that he began to figure it out.  Curse of the Black Spot was more of a situation where he had almost no information and was busy trying to keep people from killing each other."")

I don't mind characters being killed or dying.  But pretty soon they'll be zombies.  I'm expecting a Voodoo plot line to resurrect a companion soon!

The problem I see with his being wrong a ""gag"" is that he loses credibility as a hero when 2/3 of what he says is blatantly wrong, as we come to find out.  Compare this doctor, 11, with even 10, and there is a marked distinction in the way that situations are handled.  Tennent was more questioning than assuming which led him to be a more identifiable character when we see him make the leap of intuition into a complex answer.  Smith, on the other hand, seems to highlight his INability to handle a situation up to the crisis point (with people dropping left right and center along the way) where we see he's either been lying, since it is rule #1 for a reason, or just patently wrong.  This tends to lead to a trope of either a deus ex machina of ""I'll just sonic THIS now to fix everything"" or ""Good thing I thought of THIS in the last second"" which seems, to me, to be the easy way out for Moffat.

The Doctor's always been the confident guy, the guy who knows everything and at this moment, after having to tell Amy to lose faith in him, he lost it in himself. But Craig is so sweet and tells the Doctor to not be hard on himself, to give himself a break, because well, saving the world and people gets to be tiring. Craig still believes in the Doctor and it's nice to know that the Doctor can feel tired and insecure about himself like everyone else. Moffat made the Doctor so real. 

And I totally cried; bawled like a baby. 

My favourite line is when Craig said to the Doctor after he came back home (idk quoting might be a tad off): You took time off for me? 
I felt like it was silly that he asked in such a surprised way, but it made him feel like he was so important that the Doctor would miss some colossal universe event to help clean a house. And that's why we all love the Doctor: he'd take the time to help us.

As much as I love the man I was not happy when he called it children's viewing.

Too many people do not understand the difference between family viewing and children's programs. Family programs are made to entertain children but also adults. It's a mistake to label them as children only.

I think a good difference between Children's television and family is Sarah Jane Adventures which is clearly made for children and Doctor Who which is clearly made for all.

I got D, D and E, in History, Economics and Psychology appropriately. Do I feel I deserved to go? I don't know. I had various family troubles during my studies that put me off, I had to drop Maths because the college planning department failed to timetable it correctly and made it run into other subjects, had a medical issue for a few months that hurt my studies... frankly I could have and should have done better and I tried the best I could at the time, although in retrospect I wish I had been better informed about alternative colleges because the one I was at sucked.

Now I don't know what you feel a piss-poor course is. I opted to do History. Not History of Art or whatever, just straight History. As a subject, do I feel it has any value to an employer? Perhaps not, but how many subjects do? I would say a straightforward degree like Maths has precious little application in the majority of available workplaces too, for the same reasons. What matters most is the skills that someone can learn and take from a degree, and I feel the things I do as part of my History degree reflect better upon my natural talents than most other degrees. I had originally hoped to do Computing, but apparently half an AS level in Maths and Economics was not sufficiently maths based to get on to a 4 year course that covered maths.

Anyway, I feel that University should, first and foremost be an educational establishment. Employer-related skills can be taken from courses, but should not be specifically 'tacked on' to bolster employability.

I just sometimes feel singled out because I opted to do History, and people who do things such as Geography and the likes feel their subject 'matters more'. For myself, I feel History as an academic study works well with my natural skillset and equally contributes to my learning new things. I think it should have some value to an employer specifically because it isn't tailored to doing just one thing.

I don't know, perhaps you think subjects like History are pointless. There's certainly some that do. If that is the case, then I suspect you would consider me to be not worth giving a University place to and I'm wasting it on a piss-poor course. Personally I feel I'm not, and I'll defend my decisions as long as I have to. There are however a lot of students I've seen who are wasting their time though, who don't turn up to most lectures, don't contribute to seminars, don't discuss ideas and shoot down anyone with ideas - it's like they have a schoolchild mentality where it's 'uncool' to contribute more than you have to.

Whoosh.  
The point of that poster is to extol the virtues of the heritage of Britain *that is accessible via its fantastic museums and galleries*.

Yet another justification for me to watch all of NuWho. I completely ignored the meta this time around. Ok maybe not completely. I know which episodes Moffat wrote during Davies' tenure and that the show changed quite a bit when he took over. You can't really avoid knowing that - it's brought up all the bloody time.

That's one sign that a show has lost me* - when I start paying attention to who directs an episode and who gets credit for writing. How much time the opening and closing credits take up. How long into the episode before we get the opener. Which names are shown during the first scene and how long before that stops. Is it at the same pace every ep, or do the names fade in so as not to disrupt the flow?

How much time do they spend running?

How many lines/minutes on screen a character gets and is there any part of it where it's clear the actors are in the same place and the same time. (this one always makes my ears prick up - in at least one show that I know of, towards the end, the protagonist was never shown with the rest of the cast because she'd turned into such a bitch nobody could stand to be around her. she couldn't stand to be around them, either. good times.)

How many of the scenes could easily be removed without damaging the story line or season arc? How many episodes are full of filler? (I'm looking at *you,* Torchwood.)

How many explosions, how many bipedal aliens with opposable thumbs and two eyes, how much of an ep looks like CGI?

And then I get to watch Confidential. I have them burned to disc for Later.

&gt; Frankly, you can probably tell by most post titles whether it's going to be about something you haven't seen yet

That isn't true, and exactly why I made this post. Ambiguous or humorous titles often don't explain whether a seemingly innocuous comment about a plot point could be contained in the post. For example, the #1 post on this subreddit right now is titled ""[An interesting parallel](http://i.imgur.com/QwDxe.png)."" I clicked and immediately said to myself, ""What? Certain death?"" and then assumed there is an upcoming (for me) plot device where he almost dies, but doesn't.

I did this for 6 months was well paid, but after the contract had finished they let me go straight away as my part was complete.

So they requested a Novell system to push the apps, thats what they got it worked perfectly was very efficient  . Problem was that as soon as I left, nobody knew how to use Novell. You read that correctly, they did not hire anyone who could understand Novell at all except me (2005/2006). S instead of getting people in with he right skills they dropped that side and started again. Guess what happened, team built new system, team no longer needed after initial build.

I do like him a lot though (Withnail and I is the best buddy movie ever), so that'll fade as I get used to him, I assume.

&gt;Rosanna: “We ran from the Silence.”

&gt; Rosanna: “There were cracks. Some were tiny, some were as big as the sky. Through some we saw worlds and people. And through others we saw silence…and the end of all things. We fled to an ocean like ours and the crack snap shut behind us. Saturnyne was lost.” 

These seems to imply that they fled through a crack - perhaps crossing over from Universe B to A.

Correct, those decisions are made by scouts, agents, management, and ownership.

&gt; Adebayor was never deemed ""unusable"".

I believe this is a matter of semantics. Nobody doubted Adebayor's quality (although he'd been well-publicized to be a headcase). It was that City had other options (Dzeko, Balotelli, Tevez), and so was trying to shed themselves of him any way they could. He had been deemed ""unusable"", in that context.

&gt; Parker was on ""nobody's radar""? What? There must have been half a dozen Premier League teams wanting to get his signature during the summer, he had just won the Footballer of the Year Award, also.

While you're right that Chelsea were looking at him, but consensus among a quite a big swath of media/journalists was ""why are anybody chasing this guy, he's too old, he's the only thing good going at Hammers, he can't consistently make the England line-up, etc"". Perhaps it's the media environment in which I expose myself, but I had heard nothing but neutral to negative news about the guy.

&gt; To be brutally honest, everything you've said brings me to the conclusion that you don't really know what you're talking about.

Fair criticism.

I can only assume it's a recent one, because the most recent would be the one's being talked about. But saying ""episode 10"" lets me know it was a fairly recent episode. I can think back to the past couple of episodes and take a fairly good guess at which one it is. 


""AGMGTW"" is completely meaningless unless you know what the titles are, and what titles belong to what episodes. Using episode initialisms requires you have to have more knowledge than simply episode numbers.


Besides, it's trivially easy to keep track of once you know what episode number just aired. Then you simply have to keep track of ""Last week was 10, so this week is 11. That means 9 was that one two weeks ago with the ____aliens.""


Without having the title memorized, you *have* to look it up. You can't figure out what ""AGMGTW"" means or is referring to if you don't keep track of what every episode is called. See what I'm getting at? 


Both methods have their problems, but considering that using a jumble of letters requires more memorization, I think a plain number is probably a better solution.


I'm more looking at it from the angle of new and casual viewers who don't keep track of those kinds of things. Let's assume you don't know what either one means. Without being able to glance down or look it up, which one is easier to decipher, ""AGMGTW"" or ""#7""?


Though to be fair, once you *do* know what most of the titles are, your way is easier as the titles usually have the needed context to figure out what the episode what about, so you don't have to double-check a reference to be sure. Well, unless you memorize what number goes with what episode.


I guess what I'm saying is:

My way is good for new, casual, or occasional viewers, plus those with bad memory. It allows them to guess within an episode or two. Your way is good for dedicated fans.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"They've already started on the second QEC; the shipyards currently fabricating the steel sections will just keep on working interrupted until all the pieces for both carriers are made. The NAO did a comprehensive report which you can read [here](http://www.nao.org.uk//idoc.ashx?docId=d144d7d9-e564-4c67-ae6c-107a24e714c7&amp;version=-1), which has a graph on page 18 showing the utilisation of the naval shipyards. In short; the main fabrication of the carrier programme will be completed by 2014, and work on the Type 26 won't pick up until 2017 (at the earliest). Its also a fair bet that there won't be as many new frigates made as currently expected (there never is). The shipyards on the Clyde (Govan/Scotstaun) will likely be closed by the end of next year, with more to follow by the end of 2013.

The submarine sector is ticking along, but Barrow have already laid off a load of engineers and staggered out the construction of the current subs over a longer time frame with only long-lead materials on order.  The successor class will be the new Trident, but political delays due to the nature of the coalition are holding back the investment needed to start the initial research. That won't be green-lighted until the Lib Dems are back on the opposition benches.

[This](http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2011/04/typhoon-jca-f22-and-common-myths-and-hype/) is a good run-down of the current Typhoon, export potentials, and a big part of why these jobs weren't cut months ago. But the India bid looks like it will now be decided in April of next year, and only a handful of those planes would be made in the UK (the Indian's want to learn how to make fighters and part of the contract is their company of choice making the aircraft under licence; this is why the American's got kicked out of the bid - they don't share technology). Ultimately, the current world economic climate means that while some of these exports may so materialise, they are unlikely to arrive soon, or in sufficient quantities to be of much use.

That leaves the air wing of BAE with just the Hawk trainer jet and its Mantis / Tarranis UAV programmes, which are in steep competition with other companies (there is also of course the new UK/French MALE UAV programme which has just started).

The land sector of BAE is of course already gone; it lost the FRES contract to General Dynamics and closed its tank plant in Leicester last year.

BAE is going to continue to shrink, and continue to shed jobs, over the next five years. There simply isn't a demand for expensive platforms any more; there is no high-tech opposition to face. China may change that with its new carriers and huge numbers of submarines, but china is still a long way from the UK.

Furregzample, did you know that in the original *Casino Royal* movie, Peter Sellers was such a drama queen whacko nutjob that he refused to be anywhere near Orson Welles, so that all of their scenes were shot seperately.  That film sounds like the most glorious mess ever, all those directors, all those ruined careers, heart attacks and well, Woody Allen for no real reason.  Must look for a book about it.

My faveorite thing about Confidential is the way they spend 20 minutes covering the many varieties of sausage sandwiches available from the catering van, served by a lumpy bloke with warts called Eric, then spend about 14 and a half seconds with the writer actually talking about the episode.  Oh, the idiosyncracy.

Seriously though, that is my favourite.  I've been a bad lad and torrented all of series 5 and 6 so far, as I've been unable to get a blu-ray drive working on my decrepit PC, but have recently (today) given up and ordered a standalone player. My next stop will be the Blu-ray box set of series 5, and I'll do the same again this Christmas, but with a 6.  I only mention this because I'll get all the Confidentials, as well as apparently some interesting directors commentaries.  I will hopefully then have enough new material to tide me over until Series 7.  Great to be me!

Craig: What would have happened if you hadn't come?  Stop beating yourself up!  If it wasn't for you, this whole planet would be in absolute ruin.

Otherwise, there has been no evidence that a new flesh doctor was created, and we also have to wonder why. There was a very good reason that Amy and baby River had flesh counterparts, as they were used as manipulation tools by madame kovarian against the doctor. But why create another doctor?

Still don't know.  Probably a random Silent who was tasked with blowing up the TARDIS.  They used [insert explosive McGuffin name here]



* What had the Doctor been up to the entire time between dropping the Ponds off at the end of the Christmas special and showing up at the diner in Utah?

That's a good question, along with what did he do all summer looking for Melody.   You can't tell me it took him 3 months of realtime only to find nothing? 

* At what point was Amy switched for her ganger?


They said.  Between Christmas and America.  Off camera before the series started.   Not an important plot point, really, other than it happened.   Not hard to do with a race that you can't remember seeing.  Definitely implies they survived 1969, though. 


* At what point did the Doctor go back and insert himself in various bits of history? (the Laurel and Hardy movie, Tower of London, the Commandant's office, etc...)

From the time he left Amy and Rory to the time he visited Craig.  The 200 year span he went from 900+ years old to 1100 years old.

* How did the 1969 U.S. Air Force get Zero Balance Dwarf Star Alloy? Why did the Silents need to kidnap ganger Amy? Or was this when they did the switch? (Though probably not because she saw Kovarian before being taken) How long was she really in their custody?

I'm sure they got it from UNIT or TORCHWOOD or just by nature of being in AREA 51, I'm sure the US has it's own supply of tech.  There was the events of Dreamland that discussed the Roswell Crash.

[With a surface gravity of 100,000 times that of Earth, the atmosphere of a white dwarf is very strange. The heavier atoms in its atmosphere sink, and the lighter ones remain at the surface . . . . Scientists hypothesize that there is a crust 50 km thick below the atmosphere of many white dwarfs. At the bottom of this crust is a crystalline lattice of carbon and oxygen atoms. Since a diamond is just crystallized carbon, one might make the comparison between a cool carbon/oxygen white dwarf and a diamond.](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/dwarfs.html)

It really all comes down to the fact that this is a sci-fi show and they can create whatever scientific explanation they want in order to make the plot work. Since dwarf star alloy can apparently hold time-sensitive species in the DW universe, it worked with this particular plot line.

true,aussiekinga,dalek,Dalek,"Waters of Mars is one of the specials with David Tennant, towards the end of his run. In it he travels with no companions, due to the events at the end of season 4, however I don't believe any plot points for the end of season 4 are given away during the special. Actually, there is one minor thing mentioned which is the villain of the S4 finale, but it's not a big spoiler in that that information is plastered all over the DVD cover, and the mention of them doesn't ruin anything else of the S4 story.
There is one comment made prophesying to the specials after TWoM, 'The End of Time' - which is where The Doctor dies and is replaced by Matt Smith. (The prophesy was first made in the 'Planet of the Dead' special, and repeated here).

It does therefore lead into ""End of Time"" which I wouldn't watch without having finished season 4.


Overall I think you could watch The Waters of Mars without too much in the way of spoilers.

I have watched all of DW, and am only now going through Torchwood. So you don't need to have seen TW first. And I don't think DW will contain any major spoilers for TW, as the characters only turn up now and again (such as in the season finale of Season 4).


Finally, if you are new to it, season 5 is a reasonable jumping on point, that doesn't ruin many (if any) plot points from the last 4 season.

I theorize the Doctor can only tell someone his name when dying, and the only reason he would is so his death can be prevented, and she was seriously keeping him from giving spoilers on the upcoming series.

And Craig *does* prove him right - Craig goes above and beyond; Craig saves the day even after all of the Doctor's plans have failed, blowing up the Cybermen with love - and now the Doctor can walk bravely to his death, comforted by the knowledge that the human race will be okay, that he doesn't *need* to be there every time to catch the entire species as it topples towards destruction.

true,toanominaldegree,null,null,"I'm wondering at what point do River and the Doctor's time line converge/reverse? Where do they begin the romantic relationship they had mentioned throughout the series? 

It's seems that their relationship happened during the 200+ year gap. 1100 year old Doctor seems to be post-relationship, seeing as how much he enjoyed reminiscing with post-relationship River in the Impossible Astronaut. His journal was in sync with hers to the point where he was aware of spoilers that she was not. If their relationship is consistently backwards and did take place, a reversal from the previous dynamic of the series would have had to occur. Wherein the Doctor is now a future version with knowledge of River and River is a past version with no knowledge of her future relationship with the Doctor. Did the reversal occur during the Hitler episode? Or did it happen beforehand? 

Did it happen during the 3 month period in which he went looking for her? Did he find her, discover that their time lines running out of sync was fixed and that he could not bring her back to the 'present'? Is this why he did not pick up the phone in the TARDIS when Amy called? Did he lie to them or simply bend the truth when he saw them next? If he did find her during that period did he find her as Mels and leave her as he did with Amy? Or did he find her as River and when?

More than likely it was not the only thing that he was doing during that time but it seems reasonable that River was in there somewhere. ",0,1317015445,null,0,true,0,c2mm9cb,t3_kr3kn,t1_c2mm9cb,t3_kr3kn,1427647589,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

In the universe it usually does not become a problem for future and past selves to be in the same time so long as the past self does not see or interact with the future self (the future self would already be aware of the past event, them interacting with past event would be their present).

At the time, it seemed that there was a production error or a mistake of some sort was made because the Doctor was wearing his coat, which he had lost earlier in the episode.  In The Big Bang, the finale last season, we learn that the Doctor was wearing his coat because that was a version of the Doctor later in his own timeline.  Point being, there were two *different* Doctors in that episode.  There is a whole lot of speculation that there are two Doctors running around now, Doctor Who, the original, and Doctor Goo, the ganger copy.  In The Eleventh Hour, 11's first episode, the first thing he eats (and hates) is an apple, and yet in The God Complex, he looks at and eats, with no visible discomfort and without spitting it out, an apple.

I would disagree with you though, in that i *do* believe the Doctor has changed, but i think it's a good thing. Personally, i believe that a lot of Moffat's run is a direct if subtle refutation of Davies' depiction of the Doctor. Davies kept painting the Doctor in simpler and simpler colors. He's wacky. He's a genius. He always makes the right choice. He's godlike. He was sort of becoming a caricature of himself.

So now it's Moffat's turn, and how does he write his Doctor? He lies. He makes mistakes. Sometimes he makes selfish or cowardly decision. Does that make him bad? Only if being a person is bad. Moffat has worked to change him from the Lonely God into the mad man in a box, and i think the switch from deity to mortal is a refreshing one. He's fallible, which means his victories have meaning again. Now it's possible for him to make the wrong choice, so when he makes the right choice it isn't just ""ho hum that was inevitable.""

 I have watched enough Doctor Who to be suspect of him being killed while regenerating. That however isn’t the thing I have been obsessing on. Has anyone else noticed that there have been 2 recent episodes about a father’s love for his child. Or that that tick tock song is in Night Terrors. Did anyone see River’s initial reaction to Rory in A Good Man Goes To War. How about that Rory has no fears or beliefs at all. He cares about The Doctor but sees him as dangerous. I know I am Rory centric but I feel that character has a lot of secrets. Remember he has access to almost 2000 years we know nothing about. There are some distinctive interactions between Rory and the Doctor. I have this idea that the more Rory needs to access his Roman self the more tired and world ( or is it Universe/ multiverse)weary he becomes.  (To those who question that 1990 name badge remember plastic Rory was alive during real Rory’s timeline and we know nothing of his family. They weren’t even at the wedding. Amy's parents sat around them and his were never shown. )
So here is my strange theory: We know he would do anything for Amy whats to say he would not do the same for his daughter. Would he kill The Doctor for River or Amy If he thought it was the only way to save them? Would River kill him if he did?
Definate Spoiler side note: Young Rory and Young Mels are listed in the credits of The Wedding of River Song on IMDB but Young Amy is not.

I think that sort of assumption as much to do with why this project went south then the sort of management issues runnerthemoose explained.

It's never that simple with the NHS. *Ever*. The thing that IT types seem to forget is it isn’t the way that the software works which is the problem, it’s the way the rest of the NHS, the biggest employer in the country, works around it.

You can’t just design a system to meet the requirements and say ‘here you go’, as cheap as that would be. The cost of re-training everyone would likely dwarf the cost of developing the software. You’ve got to design a system which both meets modern requirements, and precisely replicates existing working practises without changing anything which might upset people.

Modifying software to the working environment is never a simple process. Mars UK is currently in exactly the same mess; they customised a the roll-out of a new global stock management system to suit the UK working practises, and its all gone to hell. They have a warehouse full of stock and only a fraction of orders being filled, and that’s a company which can afford to throw buckets of money at the problem.",0,1317030501,null,0,true,0,c2mnagb,t3_kqw4e,t1_c2mnagb,t1_c2mj8id,1427648076,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In essence rather than having a massive centralised database with all records in the data would be de-centralised allowing regions or GPs to pool together to run these smaller clusters which would be paid for by small fees being charged to hospitals for access to those records and also charging for moving a record to a different cluster as people migrate internally. 

The value from the GPs perspective was the ability to use the datasets for medical research and to offer more value-added services to patients as they would have more complete knowledge of the patient - something which is alarmingly rare even today.

Sure, the Doctor dies and no one knows how to see or properly maintain the web of time since the Time Lords are gone and he was the last. So what follows is that time itself goes nuts and everything happens at the wrong time or in the wrong order or what have you. The bizarre timelines we've seen hinted at in the previews happen as the whole structure of linear existence collapses in on itself, so all kinds of weird stuff starts happening. Several versions of all the characters, not just two but piles and piles of Doctors Amys Rorys Rivers and probably Silence people too. Somehow the Doctor or some version of him figures out a way to straighten it all out, and realizes that he can't die because he is the last being left who can keep time running the ""right"" way. They made the point that no matter what the Doctor still cares about his friends and responsibilities even at the very end. So the Doctor's burden of existence continues because he can't just lay down his life.",0,1317033692,null,0,false,0,c2mnf43,t3_kro2s,t1_c2mnf43,t3_kro2s,1427648136,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,widgetas,null,null,"From a purely ""This is the law"" point of view: everyone (well, almost) else in the country has to abide by planning rules and is penalised when they don't. I was in near Dale Farm last week and met a police officer who's been to the site and dealt with the people there. I was quite surprised at how little respect she had for them: None at all. She appeared to actually detest the group of people in general, but not without reason as she's been dealing with them and their shenanigans for years. Even if we ignore any other criminal activity (which is apparently rife), they are still living illegally. Why should a special case be made for them?

There's really no reason not to remove the people while the authorities take down the illegally built property. The ""We've been here 10 years, why are they bothering now?"" argument isn't a good one. It doesn't matter when a 'crime' was committed, people should still face the consequences of their actions.

I'm open to hear from others why I might be wrong in my feelings on this matter.

edit - and they've just won another appeal. This would be why it's taken 10 years so far...

edit 2 - I should point out that, as far as I know, there are plenty of legal houses there. The issue is only with homes that didn't get any planning permission.",0,1317033729,null,0,true,0,c2mnf6f,t3_krpch,t1_c2mnf6f,t3_krpch,1427648137,36,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,36

true,TropicalUnicornSong,uk,United Kingdom Avon/Middx,"I'm also in agreement. I think it's worth noting that the local settled residents have had a rough time with the pikeys, and deserve to have their town back. 

Unfortunately, as righteous as I feel the eviction is, I think it will turn out rather like shovelling water. These people will displace and become someone else's problem, probably leaving a snail trail of human waste and garbage as they navigate to their next unfortunate destination.

I'm not surprised the Police Officer you spoke to had little respect for them. This is a culture characterised by pushy, aggressive men and tacky, charmless women and children, known for it's deep seated criminal streak. 

It's unbelievable that these people are getting support from authorities in the form of an extension, and EU spokesmen turning up harping on about human rights. They play the race card at the drop of a hat, and the notion that this eviction constitutes ''ethnic cleansing'' is moronic.

This culture is a putrid, sickening boil on society's landscape, and I for one would love to see them fuck off back to Ireland.

By the way I'm talking about Irish pikeys, not English gypsies.

Edit: Furthermore, let's not forget that they've been offered alternative residences in the form of council houses, which they've of course rejected claiming that they're ''travellers, who prefer a life on the road'', as it's part of their culture apparently, despite the fact that they've been living in Dale Farm for the past ten fucking years. But let's not let that little disparity between reality and their version thereof get in the way of a good old hippy protest.

That's right, hoards of feckless, mouth-breathing hippies....or should I say, middle class, don't-fancy-getting-a-job-yet, self-righteous anarchist cunts have emerged from the filthy undergrowth to support the pikeys. Thank goodness these geniuses have arrived to inform us of the moral landscape. They know what's what! &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;


Notice in many of the TV interviews, the pikeys are nowhere to be seen, as they've left the soap dogders to do the dirty work for them, while they fuck off inside to drink tea and bitch about settled society.

Also, notice the distinct lack of an adult male contingent within the pikey ranks. Turns out they're all too busy to be dealing with their family's eviction and they'd rather be off tarmacking some poor pensioner's drive.

I'd prefer to have one of them always up front to stretch the space between the opponent's midfield and defence. Obviously that should mainly be Suarez because of the way he plays. 

Couple that with the fact that Gerrard very often joins in on the attack, and we're left with the situation where our central midfield consists only of Lucas. He's good, but he can't get everywhere. Against the teams playing with 3 midfielders, we'd get overrun, badly. It has already happened several times this season and I've no doubt that this would be our weakness even with Gerrard back in the side if we do go 4-4-2. 

So long story short, I'd prefer us to go back to 4-5-1. Suarez up front, Downing and Kuyt on the wings, Gerrard in the AM role, with Lucas and Adam sitting further back - Adam basically in the Alonso role - and of course I'm not saying he's as good at it, but it would obviously suit him. 

Of course, I'd rather have Mereiles instead of Adam in central midfield, as I feel he'd offer a lot more both defensively and offensively. 

Carroll would, for me, be a part of Plan B, when we either control the game so well that we can drop a midfielders, or vice versa, when we're so overrun that we need to consider the long ball tactic.

You can also call citizens advice, but they are overworked and not always able to immediately advise.
that covers your holiday stuff - get your legal position sorted out. It's not a matter of what he can afford, you are legally entitled to paid holiday, he gets no say in the matter.

now, for the boss , just don't answer the phone. Outside work time, you aren't obliged to be contactable.

for the coworker, you need to figure out how to handle her. What i would do in your place is document your problem (ie, after she gives you work, email her back with 'can you clarify this this and this etc' , ) that way, you've got written proof that she's being unclear , and the ball is in her court to fix it etc.

it also sounds like you need to find some ways to deal with stress - no job is stress free, and the better you can handle it the easier things become for you.

also, in the worst case, you can just find another job (which ok, in this economy is not the easiest, but it can be done).",0,1317038288,null,0,true,0,c2mnmuq,t3_krqhk,t1_c2mnmuq,t3_krqhk,1427648237,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"It happens all the time. People build something then after the fact discover they either haven't filed the correct planning application or filed it but the plans changed in such a way to invalidate it. Often times these ""after-the-fact"" applications are accepted.    

I'm of two minds on this one. Firstly I do think they should be punished for ignoring planning regulations but I also know that nobody will give them legal permission to build (due in part to racism and bias).    

So if you're a ""traveller"" and you want to settle down, what do you do? You get punished for doing it the legal or illegal way. Society is just hell bent on breaking your community up and there is no compromise.   

To be honest, if it was up to me, I'd turn around and agree to grant them planning permission but in exchange they have to pay through the noise financially. Make it un-cost-effective to blackmail society like this, but yet still allow them to keep their existing properties.    

Then everyone wins. These people get to keep their little community, and the next people to try it will think twice because of the future financial pressures.

http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/index.htm

On [holiday time](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/Timeoffandholidays/DG_10029788)

&gt; [full time employees] are entitled to a minimum of 5.6 weeks paid annual leave - 28 days for someone working five days a week 

[...]

&gt; part-time workers are entitled to the same level of holiday pro rata

So you should be getting 5.6 * 5 * 2/5 = ~11 days paid holiday per annum

&gt; Also, am I right in thinking that I am required by law to have an actual, physical, on-a-piece-of-paper employment contract?

No.  From [here](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/EmploymentContractsAndConditions/DG_10027905):

&gt; Your employment contract doesn’t have to be in writing. However, you are entitled to a written statement of your main employment terms within two months of starting work.

Next point:

&gt; Add to that a passive-aggressive co-worker who doesn’t explain properly what she wants me to do and then gets mad when I screw it up

Your first course of action should be to politely address these concerns with her.  Ask if you can arrange to have a meeting with her to discuss your work.  At the meeting, ask her if there's something you've done wrong and how you can improve it.  Assuming she reacts reasonably and says something like ""You should be more blah blah and keep me informed about blah blah"", you should then follow up the meeting with an email to her, cc'd to your boss, saying something like ""Thank you for our meeting earlier to address how I can better fulfil my role.  In response to the points you made, I will blah blah the blah blah with blah days of you requesting it and I will blah blah whatever else you asked me to blah blah"". 

Make sure you save the email (not on your work computer) and/or print out a copy for your records (keep it at home in case you turn up to work one morning and find you no longer have access to the building).  This is important because it demonstrates that you showed willing to investigate and correct any perceived defaults in your work.

&gt; Oh, and that my boss likes to occasionally phone me up at around half 8/half 9 in the evenings to voice his suspicions about other members of staff.

Unless you have previously agreed that you will be available on call in the evenings, you have no obligation to take his calls.  If you do take his calls then it counts as work time and you can take the equivalent time off in lieu, or request overtime.

If/when your boss says ""I called you last night and you didn't answer"" tell him politely that you can make yourself available to be on call between the hours of X and Y on whatever days you like, assuming that you'll be paid for it or can take the time off in lieu.

&gt; I fear that when I do phone him, I will explode and all the aforementioned stuff will come out in a fiery ball.

If you have been signed off work and have informed them of the fact then I don't *think* you have any obligation to phone your boss.  Send him an email saying that you will be back to work on X day and will gladly have a meeting with him then.  Do the same thing - ask him what's wrong with your performance (if anything), take notes, and follow it up with an email so that you have a written record of what was discussed and/or agreed.  You might want to print out the above pages to show him if and when you discuss your holiday entitlement.

Do not, under any circumstances, explode and let the aforementioned stuff come out in a fiery ball.  You do not want them to have any claim that you have acted angrily, irrationally or anything like that.  If you feel yourself losing your cool then ask for the meeting to be adjourned for an hour or so to give you time to think/calm down.

If you feel that they are making your life hell and you can't continue to work there, then you should write them a letter explaining why you are leaving (again, politely, factually and without emotion) and use the phrase ""I feel my position is untenable and that I have no choice but to tender my resignation"".  You may then have a case against them for [constructive dismissal](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/RedundancyAndLeavingYourJob/Dismissal/DG_10026696) (follow the advice on this page - there's more detail than what I've written).

If they get rid of you then you may have a case for [unfair dismissal](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/RedundancyAndLeavingYourJob/Dismissal/DG_10026692).

Finally, don't trust any advice given to you by a random stranger on the internet.  :-)

Contact ACAS and/or your Citizen's Advice Bureau and they will be able to help you out.  See [this page](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/ResolvingWorkplaceDisputes/index.htm) for more info.

[Wiki for AD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini):

&gt; This calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of Jesus of Nazareth, with AD counting years after the start of this epoch, and BC denoting years before the start of the epoch.

The Wiki also details how often the date of Jesus' birth has ""changed"", thus affecting the exact period covered by AD.

&gt; Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive date

&gt; Some scholars rely on John 8:57[22]: ""thou are not yet fifty years old"", making the earliest possible year for Jesus's birth c. 18 BC

I know it's just nitpicking, but CE at least says ""we're counting from this year, because that's where we're counting from"" rather than AD's ""we're counting from this year because this is when we think something significant happened... but we're not sure, and it's open to change, though probably not"".",0,1317040081,null,0,false,0,c2mnqqb,t3_krpy6,t1_c2mnqqb,t1_c2mnoe3,1427648301,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

EDIT:

So every year the UEFA Champion's League takes place during the regular soccer season. The tournament consists of the best teams from the top leagues of Europe. Each of the top leagues (decided by really convoluted strange statistics) gets a certain amount of teams that can participate. I think this year England has 4, Germany has 3, Spain has 4, Italy has 2, and France has 2? Maybe? Anyway, what's important for you is that they give the Champion's League places to the top 4 teams in the premier league from last year

As you may or may not know Liverpool didn't finish in the top 4 so they don't participate this year. There are pluses and minuses to this situation, mostly economic. Being in the Champion's league yields huge money from ticket prices but mostly TV revenue (additionally it is considered one of the most prestigious titles to hold in the world)

This means that Liverpool couldn't afford to bring in a player like Eden Hazard during the last transfer window because 1) we didn't have as much money if we were in the CL and 2) he wanted to play for a team that has Champion's league soccer.

All the City fans (maybe 30 or 40) were seated together though, and you could hear them chanting and cheering the entire game. And thats why I decided to follow them. Because of the fans. I knew nothing about the club or the money or anything, I chose them because they lost 3 -nil, essentially.

This idea has been played with in many episodes in the classic Dr. Who, 2 notable examples are the Valeyard, which is the incarnation of the Doctor's dark side, and 7th Doctor. And it continues to be played with. I do agree that the Doctor is terribly complex but I think it is the anti-hero within himself that makes it so. He has to grapple with knowledge that he could potential control time and space itself, just like the saying power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Look what it did to the Timelords, his entire race opted to wipe out the universe for their own gain in power. I think this is a much bigger part of his darker side than his self-loathing and I, also, think draws on it/gives into it from time to time which causes his self-loathing.

So in short I do agree that he is self-loathing, even more than usual, but I think it is because he is drawing on his dark side to do something (or has done something) in order to save himself from final death and the clincher is that he justifies because he is the only one that stands between the monsters and us, and he is right...

It's true that Lennon and Bale on the wings is one of our most potent attacking threats and I know teams fear coming up against them.  So many teams play narrow and that limits them.  

Having not one but two extremely quick wingers really makes a difference in my opinion.  Playing van der Vaart or Modric on the right side really changes the way we play.  With Walker becoming quite impressive it's not as huge an issue, but I would not want to lose Lennon since he's our best natural right sided winger.

Second of all, Amy's flaw is that she worships the Doctor.  It's clear that this isn't a good trait in her.  The Doctor messed up her entire childhood, but she still adores him, despite it creating massive issues with abandonment and growing up.  Their relationship is not equal, but the Doctor is strongly paternal towards her.  It would be boring if she were Donna 2.0 and was always snapping and calling him spaceman.

Like I said you can have your own reading, but I really think that the character has too much heroism to be made petty or simply scared.

I think his self-loathing in this incarnation is much more a factor of his heroism than it is of his weakness or dark side.  He's a god who's going through a self-critique and that's likely to be a pretty epic thing when you think about it.

He's undergoing this critique in order to improve himself so that he can be a better person, or timelord, god, whatever.

He's faced his death so many times before and was plenty certain it was coming but never shrinked from that.  The difference here is that he's also beating himself up over other things.

He's going through a bit of a mid-life crisis.  Or a quarter-life crisis.  Or a  pre-millennial crisis.

I mostly agree. I worded it poorly, but I think it's plain that the Timelords took it upon themselves to be the instilled order in the universe. I think we have enough evidence to show they were not completely necessary post reboot since the TimeLords were essentially pulled out of existence into the Time War. The rebooted Who is essentially a universe that never had Timelord interventionism, because if the Time Lords were even still occupying their own past the Doctor would inevitably run into them in our universe, therefore, the maintaining of the web of time was not explicitly necessary.

Also, remember Deadly Assassin and Arc of Infinity are good arguments why the Timelords are not responsible when it comes to watching over time, because they seem to always be nefarious or inept thereby causing the biggest problems.

That being said, the one story that would be wibbly-wobbly enough to justify the involvement of several Doctors (and even companions) for the purpose of good story is the Time War. The premise: Some evil, external force enters the aforementioned time-locked event and simultaneously pulls in multiple Doctors (5, 6, 7, 10, 11). Their goal is to escape the time lock before the war ends, or the Doctor's existence throughout the cosmos is permanently erased, and the only way to do it is to aid Eight in defeating the still-mysterious Nightmare Child and using The Moment to destroy the Daleks (which for whatever reason is the only way they can all go home).

Have it end with Eight sacrificing himself to ensure the escape of his fellow incarnations. If they can't have Eccleston make a cameo, his final shot can be the beginning his regeneration as he disappears in bright light while all the other Doctors are forced to leave him behind.

That's why you shouldn't have mentioned it.

Teachers teach to the curriculum.   
The current ICT curriculum is crap. End of story, really.

(As an aside I believe there *may* be computer ""science"" GCSEs or A-levels, but they're harder than ICT, and so it's not worth teaching them when all subjects are worth about the same. Also we don't have that many teachers who are capable of teaching it).

So what you *should* have mentioned in your letter is how the curriculum is crap, and that the number of kids capable of simple computer programming tasks has plummeted in the last 20 years or so.

You should have suggested that computer programming should be a mandatory subject in schools (or that it should be mandatory for schools to offer it as an option), accessible languages like Javascript (??) and Python and that Free and open-source software can fulfil the need for a programming platform at zero licensing cost.

Many schools already require kids to have a laptop, so promoting the Raspberry Pi is just a distraction. I believe in the value of the Raspberry Pi, but it's difficult to explain in one paragraph - it's more a reaction to the number of kids who have £300 laptops (or schools that have classrooms full of PCs) on which they can't so easily install Linux because they're expected to learn Excel and Word (!!!) for class.",0,1317086676,null,0,false,0,c2mtp9n,t3_kryoi,t1_c2mtp9n,t3_kryoi,1427651162,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,strolls,null,null,"1. We don't know what's causing his low speeds - it may not at all be Orange's fault. I live 1.4 miles from my exchange, by a fairly direct route, yet my line is only capable of about the same speed as he shows, because [the cable used in parts of my town is rubbish](http://www.adamchapman.com/mkbag/issue/default.html) [link is not my site]. I would be *glad* to get 3.5meg down - right now my line is synchronised at only 2meg.

2. Broadband is a commodity market in the UK, and you more or less get the quality you pay for. I say ""more or less"" because the more money your provider spends on TV adverts, the less they'll have to spend on peering and technical support. It's well-known that some of the best-known UK ISPs are rubbish - buying broadband on the basis that the TV advert says ""woah! it's really fast dude! like lightspeed!"" is a mug's game. If you read consumer reports then the fastest ISPs are well-documented - ADSLguide.org has league tables which are updated regularly and the forums there are reliable (*Which?* might also be worth a look). It's not hard to find out which ISPs are consistently and reliably fast.

ISP's claims are *not* to be trusted. A customer of mine lives in an area of my town which has long been notorious for having poor line quality; he had an ADSL service with Eclipse Internet. When Openreach installed FTTH / FTTC (fibre) in his street, BT sent him a letter advertising their 40meg ""Infiniti"" service. Unaware that he could have got a fibre-based alternative (i.e. using the same line that Infiniti offered, and comparable speeds) he signed up for it, but interestingly he did so on a second line. When the new service was first installed he was able to freely switch between the two networks (using a network cable or choosing the other wifi network) and irrespective of the speedtest results (like that posted by the submitter here), his homepage loaded *visibly* faster on the older ""slower"" ADSL service. BT actually sent an engineer when they installed the service and he asked the guy about it - the engineer could only shrug and say ""it's working, phone technical support"". The homepage was not tied to either ISP but was a horse-racing news website.

Poor line quality can sometimes be resolved, if your ISP is any good. My mother had Openreach (BT wholesale) digging up her street and garden this week, putting in a new line between her house and the nearest cabinet. It took a ridiculous amount of work and persistence to get this work done, basically nagging the ISP - they had to start a second ticket because the first one got too long for their call tracking system. This was only possible after moving to a better ISP - I had tried with her previous provider and she had had at least two visits from Openreach engineers in the past. But her previous provider's idea of tech support was a call centre full of clueless idiots who demanded hours of phonecalls, whereas the newer ISP was staffed by professionals who responded to updates logged on their webpage. After years of my mother saying ""yes, but my current provider are so cheap and I get free phonecalls"" we were able to get this resolved within weeks of moving to the reputable provider.

Finally, most ISPs these days have ""fair usage"" limits on their ""unlimited"" plans. Yes, I think this is bullshit, too, but this is a fairly well-established practice now, and we all know how to deal with it. Find out what the ISP's ""fair usage"" terms are before signing up with them. Many ISPs have off-peak periods during which the limit does not apply - I can download as much as I like between 11pm and 9am, and I use the scheduler plugin for the Deluge bittorrent client to administrate this. You can get little NAS hard-drives that will run such a schedule. 40gb per month is a bit of a piss-take, IMO, but there are ways to deal with it. A&amp;A ISP will allow you to guy 1TB of off-peak bandwidth for £3 a month.",0,1317090075,null,0,false,0,c2mu5nw,t3_ks3c5,t1_c2mu5nw,t1_c2mrq2u,1427651377,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Repair attempts

Despite a general lack of enthusiasm for fixing the chameleon circuit, there were nevertheless a few efforts made.

The Fourth Doctor was hoping to repair it in Logopolis by using Block Transfer Computations when the Master interfered with the Logopolitans' calculations. (DW: Logopolis)

Nyssa tried to repair it on her own, without even referencing the TARDIS manual. After double-checking her work and finding it surprisingly sound, the Fifth Doctor chose an overly-ambitious environment for the first test of Nyssa's work. He materialized in one of Earth's oceans, whereupon it turned into a whale - both externally and internally. It became so comfortable in its new form that it seemed to forget that it was a TARDIS at all. Only by transmitting his heartsbeat (sic!) underwater and reminding it of its link to him was the Doctor able to swim into one of its arteries, undo Nyssa's fixes, and return it to its usual police box shape. (BFA: The Deep)

The Sixth Doctor's next attempt was more successful. He repaired it for a brief period when he returned to Totter's Lane in 1985, but after it began to transform into shapes that still refused to blend into their surroundings - and on some occasions even made it hard to figure out how he was meant to enter his ship in the first place - he reverted it back to its usual police box form. (DW: Attack of the Cybermen)

During his seventh incarnation, the Doctor briefly enabled his ship — or, more precisely, a version of his TARDIS (NA: Blood Heat) — to work again. (NA: Conundrum) He later reset it to a police box after Mortimus hacked into the circuit and nearly gave away its location by turning it into the Statue of Liberty while it was materialised around Nelson's Column.

true,strolls,null,null,"Basically because the EEC was presented to the British public as a simple common agricultural policy and trade agreement, which would streamline importing and exporting of goods and reduce the need for paperwork and customs checks when going on foreign holidays.

People of my father's generation (he's in his 70s) feel that the federalised Europe that the EEC has become is ""seceding our sovereignty"", and that they never agreed to this. My father grew up during WWII - he remembers ration cards, his street was bombed, his father came home from serving when he was c 15 - and so this concept of ""Great British sovereignty"" is important to him. There are plenty of people 20 years his junior who have inherited such ideals, having grown up relatively post-war. 

I'm pro-Europe, but culturally, especially during the latter half of the last century, federal Europe makes a lot more sense to people who grew up and live in the core western European countries - I would imagine that there is a huge percentage of them who can be in another European state, driving less than an hour or two. When you regularly go shopping in a neighbouring country you realise more readily how much you have in common with them.

So the fact that we're an island doesn't help, nor does the inclusion of FSB (Former Soviet Block) countries. In the former case, just the Dover to Calais part of the trip takes planning and an hour or 90 minutes, and discourages mingling. Not to mention that Calais itself is pretty shitty - all there is there is a Tescos, so you probably have to drive an hour to see ""the real France"", not like popping over the Italian border into Provence. The latter FSB countries are still perceived by the likes of my father - and in fact many over 40 - as grey communist dystopias of neglected towerblocks, the narrative they grew up with during the Cold War. These people ask ""what do we have in common with these countries"" and perceive them (probably wrongly) as a burden and a tax drain.

As I say, I'm pro-Europe, but IMO the anti-European sentiment of many (older folks in particular, and not just in the UK) robs the EC of some of its legitimacy. The close Irish referendums on the Lisbon treaty is a good example - 53% for and 47% against is hardly a glowing mandate to proceed. Practically half the population is being dragged in kicking and screaming by the other half. In fact, those percentages are only the turnout - half the Irish didn't bother to vote, because they knew that their politicians would keep dragging them out to the polls until they got the result they wanted and an irrevocable decision had been made. The previous referendum had been cancelled when the conclusion had been forgone, so in response to this the European Constitution was watered-down.

Generally I feel this is characteristic of the whole Euro saga - we're not able to legitimately plough ahead with Europe with the full approval of the population (in Spain 77% voted yes for a Euro constitution, compared with the aforementioned Irish 53%), so Europe has become a big mess of compromise to appease the naysayers. The core Western European countries wanted a common currency, but they weren't prepared to secede financial responsibilities - hence Greece's financial mismanagement is able to take down the whole Euro (it may not do so, but its government debt had no checks imposed upon it by Europe).

I could go on a lot longer about this, but there comes a point at which one is rambling. British politicians have spent decades pandering to Euro-sceptics - making a show of sovereignty makes them seem important. Yet what's the point of our British politicians when the laws they're passing are merely British language implementing European dictates (pub smoking laws) or we can appeal our human rights to the European High Court and overturn any law passed in the Houses Of Parliament. It's not in the interests of politicians (MPs or MEPs) to emphasise the influence of Europe, because it will only lead to *Daily Fail* readers and a pensioners (large voting blocks) calling for an end to it (which is probably not at all realistic).

true,Sigma-44,dalek,Dalek,"I can see your point as bringing back some humor to the series, and I completely agree that this season was pretty dark. I just wish it was more of a ""real"" episode, I guess my real main problem with this one is that Craig lived. Which I understand that if he died the entire point of this episode would be flipped on its head, but the love of his child?

This might just be a personal bias towards this type of event, but I cringe every time this is done. These are a race that screech across the stars doing as they please because they are strength incarnate, nothing stands in their way unless that thing is stronger than they are. Which of course so far has been our raggedy man, but the simple emotion of one single human stops them? If this power existed these men of metal wouldn't be able to get five feet before some baby cries and things start hitting fans.
