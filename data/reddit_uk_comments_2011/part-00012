true,justlaw,null,null,"Guys, thanks for all your comments on this video and thanks to bevem2 for posting it up.

Just to be absolutely clear the police are very limited to their powers of entry to private homes in the UK. This is covered in Section 17 of the Police and criminal evidence act. There are also long standing powers of entry for 'breach of the peace', this is a commonlaw right.

In this instance the police officer had no right of entry, he did a number of other things on top of trespass, including threatening to arrest for 'obstructing an officer'. Be in no doubt this officer was completely in the wrong, he was acting without any lawful authority. 

The officer left the police, thereby avoiding any disciplinary action. (a common tactic used by police in UK, indeed the officer who beat Ian Tomlinson had also avoided disciplinary for violent conduct by leaving the police. He then rejoined another police force and the rest is history)

This officer was a bully and like most bullies probably did this kind of thing to others. If not for the 999 call his claims that he'd never entered the property may well have been unchallengeable. Certainly you can hear in the video the officer being asked to leave and the officer refusing.

Please each and everyone of you stand up for your rights. Freedom is not genetic, you do not give it to your children. Each generation must fight to protect it.

true,jhchrist,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"The original Doctor Who introduced quite a bit of reusable technobabble (e-space, chameleon, randomizer, and dematerialization circuits, sonic screwdriver, the matrix, regeneration, etc...), as well as quite a number of episodes that have nothing to do with technology at all, where they're in some forest on an alien planet, and technobabble might only creep in on the edges (eg Tom Baker: Face of Evil, but there are lots). It seems like there is more random, nonsense-of-the-week stop-asking-questions technobabble in the new series, and that its taking a more central role, too.

Star Trek frequently had either *consistent* technobabble (warp field, phasers, transporters, dilithium crystals, cloaking devices, subspace, etc...), or technobabble based off of scientific ideas in vogue at the time (TNG: Yesterday's Enterprise, TNG: Genesis, TNG: The Loss). With Star Trek, you can usually have a basic idea of whats going on because it lets you learn what the technology is and how the technology works. When its just a new random string of words every episode, the audience disengages because they can't get any real idea of whats what.

**tl;dr**: Its not the amount of technobabble, but how reusable and learnable it is. They should build a canon of technology and try to stick with it.",0,1299981465,null,0,false,0,c1kijzq,t3_g2seh,t1_c1kijzq,t1_c1ki96i,1426981669,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The most frequent place I tip is a Chinese restaurant I go to, where the food is always amazingly well cooked, presented and the waiters *usually* are very accommodating and pleasant.

I also tip a cab driver if he's a nice guy, knows the route he's taking and doesn't try to talk to me about something I really don't care about and ignore any signs that I'm completely disinterested.

And I don't tip my barber simply because, whilst he's a nice guy and he does a good cut, his prices are above average as it is.

I hate the mere concept of what a lot of people perceive to be 'tipping' these days. People working in the service industry should **not** expect to receive tips and be pissed off when they don't; I don't say this conveniently either; my opinion would still stand if I worked in one of the industries.

true,UNITBlackArchive,tardis,,"I was a huge Trekkie for years, until the Abomination that JJ Abrams made.  But even with Trek, around Voyager, it was getting a bit dull.  When I started getting into Doctor Who, I realized what had been missing from Trek and I loved it. 

With Classic Trek - Kirk-era stuff - there was tech, but a lot of the episodes just had crazy stories and we loved them.   Sylvia and Korob were really just little chicken creatures with seemingly magical powers.  No explanation needed.  Trelane was some sort of matter-to-energy creature, but really a kid, not an adult.  Got it.   Don't need to technobabble out of it.   Tribbles really make no sense, but they were fun.   

During the Next Gen era, they would use technobabble to enhance the story to make the Sci-fi concept more believable, and that was good, but some of the episodes had technobabble being the plot point.  Quantum string entities and Anti-time and such could get in the way of just telling an interesting story.  I found that over time, it made some stories boring and at times made it lose the magic of the storytelling.  Overall, I loved Next Gen and DS9, but with Voyager, it was getting stale.  Enterprise was good at times, but still lacked the spark of just telling a fun story. 

Doctor Who just says, ""Hey, there's a weird thing"" and moves on.  No explanation given and none really needed.  Shaking off the need to technobabble everything and give a rational explanation actually made me love the show so much more.   

Jack had a squareness gun.  It makes square holes and repairs them.  Got it.   Don't need to know how it works.  Not important to the story.   The story moved on.   Silurians live underground and use Geo-thermal energy.  Got it.  Don't need explanations of their tech or their biology.  Weevils in Torchwood.  Weird things that came through the rift.  Aliens? Mutated people?  Doesn't matter.  And what caused the rift and what type of energy is it?  Doesn't matter.   What is the TARDIS power source? Who cares.    What radiation does a Sonic Screwdriver emit?  Don't know.  Don't care.  Not important.   

There's a time and a place for Technobabble.   I love the Star Trek tech manuals, but DW doesn't get bogged down in it and I love that. 

Now, possibly hypocritical of me, but I hated the Star Trek JJ Abrahms movie because they tried to use it but it made no sense.   ""Red Matter"" as a liquid that makes black holes made absolutely no sense.  I don't even think DW could pull that off and make it work..

&gt;It's not just faith schools - it's multi-million pound subsidies to religious organisations, it's contracting out public services to religious bodies, it's exempting religious employers from non-discrimination laws, it's employing faith advisors in every government department, it's keeping 26 bishops in our national Parliament, it's privileging religion in charity law, it’s constantly misinterpreting the 2001 census as saying that 72% of people have a religious faith - it goes on and on. And most of that was done by the Labour government that our new Communities Secretary Eric Pickles deplores as anti-religious.
So forget niceties about whether you are culturally Anglican or not: think about the effect your answer will have on government policy.

Couldn't agree with him more. Our last 2 prime ministers have been Christian (maybe more I'm not sure). They think it is representative of Britain to have religious people in our parliament. It isn't.

Opponents of News Corp’s bid for British Sky Broadcasting have taken their fight to the corridors of power with a direct lobbying effort principally aimed at Liberal Democrat MPs and peers.

The alliance of newspaper owners and BT have sent a letter to politicians of all parties challenging the ideas underpinning a remedy accepted by Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, to answer regulators’ concerns over the concentration of news provision represented by the proposed 700p-a-share bid.


In its letter to MPs and peers, the group says that the remedy if fatally flawed. If accepted, it would see Sky News spun off as a freestanding, listed company funded by a 10-year contract with BSkyB, with News Corp as a 39.1 per cent shareholder.

People advising the group say that while the lobbying campaign does not mean they have abandoned hope of a legal challenge to Mr Hunt if he allows the merger following a 15-day consultation, it is a stronger option at present.

“Politics can be a quicker and more decisive path than the law,” a spokesman for the alliance said on Sunday.

The alliance says the new company will be “in a state of economic dependency vis a vis News Corporation” and that proposed safeguards of its editorial independence are “weak and of the sort that News Corporation has previously being adept at undermining”, a reference to similar arrangements allowing Rupert Murdoch to take over Dow Jones in 2007 and The Times and Sunday Times in 1981.

The letter, which has been distributed to senior Liberal Democrats at their conference in Sheffield, also claims that neither Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, nor the Office of Fair Trading believe the remedy is sustainable in the long term.

In accepting the remedy as an answer to problems identified by Ofcom last January, Mr Hunt pointed out that Ofcom had said that the 10-year nature of the deal did represent “the long-term” in the fast-moving media world.

There are other planks to the opponents’ argument.

They say the 15-day consultation period is too short and that settling the details of the remedy “puts too much power in the hands of the culture secretary, rather than independent regulators”.

The person familiar with the group’s strategy said that the undertakings published by Mr Hunt are so vague that they represent a “pig in a poke”.

No financial details are provided, making it impossible to tell whether the new company could be sustainable.

Some analysts have argued that the remedy makes Sky News more vulnerable to financial failure than it is currently, which makes Mr Hunt’s claim that he is acting to protect diversity of voices in the media, seen unreasonable.

The bid’s opponents believe the Liberal Democrats, members of the UK’s governing coalition, are unhappy about the terms of the deal and its accelerated nature being favourable to the News Corp, whose UK newspapers gave the party a torrid time during the 2010 election campaign.",0,1300047305,null,0,false,0,c1kljvs,t3_g3973,t1_c1kljvs,t3_g3973,1426983152,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

When I think of an Olympic Games, I think of something exciting and memorable, like (And I have some bias here as I'm Canadian) the most recent Vancouver Olympics with the Canada- US gold medal game. Even if the US had scored in overtime, that would have been a fantastic game, and if they were to go to a place like that it could elicit the kind of feelings that the BBC commentator had during the time The Doctor picked up the torch. If you're going to make a speech like that, make it so that you have those kinds of feeling, whether or not these particular Olympic games have happened yet or not.

2 to 3 -Quick shot of 3 falling down.  Then he's in the hospital

3 to 4 -Quick scene with 4 on the floor, then he gets up and changes clothes

4 to 5 -5 wears 4's burgundy outfit briefly

5 to 6 -6 is seen with 5's outfit for some time

6 to 7 -7 wears 6's costume for the first story

7 to 8 -No costume change as 7 was in surgery.  8 wakes naked in the morgue

8 to 9 -Not shown on screen

9 to 10 -10 seen breifly in 9's jacket, but promptly gets put in bed in Pajamas

10 to 11 -11 wore 10's suit for most of the first episode, but it was badly damaged

true,Borax,cnty-expat,Low Orbit,"There are a LOT of ways to go about this.
My personal crusade is the regulation and control of recreational drugs, so I'll focus on that.

There are a lot of ways to go about this, the most effective being a fully regulated system as proposed by the [Transform Drug Policy Foundation](www.tdpf.org.uk). Implemented over the course of several years, this would pull the rug from under the feet of organised criminals, dissolving the £10bn+ drugs cost us each year. There is no doubt that we would need to re-invest some of this into regulatory bodies, education and other mechanisms to ensure such a system runs smoothly, but overall there would be not just a financial benefit, but our freedom and safety would benefit too.

If you didn't want to take that specific route, then you could always cut the legs off of the Taliban, by shifting every penny we spend on keeping ""our boys"" in Afghanistan on steering Afghani farmers away from growing opium instead. A huge percentage of Europe's heroin comes from Afghanistan, and guess who gets all the proceeds from the conversion to heroin and then sale on the streets.

Assume 20% of the Afghan population is an opium farmer, and that the UK's Afghanistan war bill is £1bn/year, (a low estimate, since all estimates suggest the cost has been in the billions for the past 3 years and continues to rise.) The average wage in Afghanistan is around US$500 
Spreading this money amongst the farmers means that farmers could be paid about $250/year to grow wheat instead of opium, 50% on top of their normal yearly wage.

This would result in more wheat for the world, and less opium for the Taliban. With less money, the Taliban would shrivel as the UK government wants it to, the heroin supply would dry up, as the government wants it to, and there would be more money for public services, something the government appears not to want.

Even with these incredibly conservative estimates we see that fighting fire with fire is pretty much the least efficient use of our money. This doesn't require any change in drug policy, so if Dave doesn't want to read [TDPF](www.tdpf.org.uk)'s enlightening tomes, he doesn't even have to. 
Win-win, right?

true,holohedron,null,null,"You know, my instinctive was to just say ""no way, few things ever are"", but as I was actually RTFP instead of answering the title I realised that actually this might not be such a bad idea. There's so many people at university in the UK doing all kinds of ridiculous junk degrees with no hope of being employed at the end of it (and on state welfare). Even for really good subjects it's hard to find a job at the end of it.

It's the typical result of something Blair really believed in and behind the policies he made when in power - believing anything the government was responsible for could be improved by making decisions based wholly on targets and simple statistics. A typical example would be something like education. Labour seemingly decided that by increasing the number of people going to university by a specific % it would automatically improve the quality of education, as a whole, in the UK.

The trouble with targets like this is people achieve them. Universities naturally accepted more and more students and as the country became richer based on an accounting *disaster* of a bubble more and more people could afford the amount, especially with fees paid for by the government (through borrowing money of course). It was unsustainable from the start. There simply aren't enough courses that make you employable in the UK, and with the global recession and particularly dry UK finances there aren't really enough higher level jobs to go around either. 

Britain could have been an industrial powerhouse of a nation. Right from the Industrial Revolution until today it was always known for being innovative and capable of making everything 'in house'. Perhaps we can revisit that idea by helping manufacturing industries i.e. companies that could expand the number of reasonably capable technical labourers, and start to at least pay them a minimum wage, they stand a good chance as an industry of making money. This would also have the handy knock-on effect of being a benefit to the national economy.

If Britain actually made something of value instead of gaining a large % of its GDP through reorganising money in vaults, money that turned out to have just been a bank's imagination anyway, things like a global recession wouldn't sting so much when they hit - we'd still be making something of value.

In Keynes' theory, one person's spendings goes towards another's earnings, and when that person spends her earnings she is, in effect, supporting another's earnings. This circle continues on and helps support a normal functioning economy. 

When a recession hits, people's natural reaction is to hoard their money. This stops the circular flow of money, slowing the economy. If the government cuts spending at the same time, everyone is cutting and the economy will stall badly.

A Keynesian economist would say the solution to this poor economic state is for the government to step in and increase spending, either by increasing the money supply or by actually buying things on the market itself. Focussing on getting the economy working first, and put off cutting the deficit until the economy is in recovery (when tax income will be rising too).

People talk about government spending as a contributor to the consumer cycle as this would be the answer but where does that money go?  On imports of course as we have no industry to speak of when it comes to the things people spend money on.  So any government spending will just contribute to the downward trend of our economy.  

I would suggest that the way people invest needs to be looked at.  Right now investment is based on best returns which isn't in anything that actually produces anything.  If we had incentives for people to invest in jobs, manufacturing, research and development we would have investment that contributes to a real economy and not a paper made one that can be gone as quickly as it was invented.

So I would suggest that tax breaks be given for schemes that produce what we need in this country so greater returns would be gained from socially conscious minded investment.

We are short on natural resources so deep cuts from the Canadian model will not work here.  Economic growth in resource rich countries work on the exploitation of those resources which brings money in which would not have been their in the first place.  Their whole system is based on exponential growth and when that is interrupted their whole system will fall.

So the only resources we can glean are those in which we create.  Invention, development, and production.  Our tax system does not promote such things.  You will find that much of this kind of resource will be found in countries that do not punish the proprietor for being inventive and progressive.  Every effort is made to accommodate such people with speedy government decisions that do not stifle the growth of their ideas.

No matter what cuts are necessary.  But along with those cuts there needs to be an invitation coupled with a lot of ass kissing to those who can create jobs.  Then the government needs to concentrate more on educating our young to be the brightest candidates for those jobs.  To many useless degrees and certifications are given out that lead our educated to menial positions irritating the rest of the public with unwanted calls to buy yet another policy that takes money out of our economy.",0,1300104236,null,0,false,0,c1kofsn,t3_g3dnr,t1_c1kofsn,t3_g3dnr,1426984509,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

3. Holding-Mid/Winger: I know opinions vary about the two players I'm about to mention... but I think players like Charlie Adam (a solid holding midfielder who is proving himself in the Premier League) and Ashley Young (a player who can provide some width in the midfield).

4. Reina: This situation is the elephant in the room. If we can convince Pepe to stay... no worries. We carry on with other priorities, but if Pepe leaves, I'm sure there'll have to be a long hard search for a worthy replacement.

In fact the top corporations and financial institutions are recording record profits. If this is a time of austerity why the fuck are the rich getting richer than ever before?

The BBC world service cuts are short sighted as well. In the long term the BBC world service has done more for British foreign interests than any foreign aid program or military intervention. By being a informative, fair and neutral news and information source people associate these qualities with Britain.

The education cuts are also pretty dumb. In the modern world the only thing that will keep Britain afloat is a educated work force.

But with this absurd focussing on 5 A*-C grades - a figure that, by definition, not everyone is going to be able to achieve - schools have looked for a way to show off how good they are while still allowing kids who would not traditionally be able to achieve that level at GCSE to have some hope of doing something equivalent, so they're not on the scrapheap at 16.

This is why the vocational qualifications exist.  Yes, they are a dodge for a fundamentally broken system, but the key point is that they do not disadvantage kids for whom a traditional academic pathway would be unsuitable.

The kids at my school are economically deprived and lack social mobility.  Parental support is at a premium.  They come in, by and large, underachieving at 11 and on average leave us at 16 with some sort of value added in.

I shudder to think how many of our kids would react to a purely academic pathway.  When they see themselves achieving D to G grade work after 20 years of governmental grandstanding about the gold star A*-C level, they will simply give up.

Until the ridiculous league tables are done away with, that measure and compare incomparable schools with each other, the disparity will stay, and we will be forced to compel these students down inappropriate pathways that will set them up to fail.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's an interesting form of synchretism that's happened in the UK. 

Saint Nicholas has always been big here, almost to the extent of being the unofficial Patron Saint of the Union, and even after the reformation, recusants and the less committed Protestants still prayed to him for intercession more than any other single saint, including Mary (This is impressive, since the Marian Cult was always strong in England).

As time passed however, and the new reformed faith became more ingrained in people's minds, even Saint Nicholas began to fall out of favour, save among the remaining Catholics who still held strong to their old beliefs. However, whereas nowadays, many people will use the phrase ""Oh my God"", or its variants without actual thought to its meaning, 18th and 19th century British Catholics for whom using the name of the Lord was blasphemy, substituted this with the name of Saint Nicholas. BUT, and this is the really interesting part, they began to corrupt the name, as the name of Saint Nicholas would be a shibboleth to identify the speaker to any hardline protestant who would be obliged to turn them over to the authorities for the fitting punishment. So instead, they prayed to ""San Iclas"".

Eventually, with Catholic Emanicpation, there was a widespread ""opening up"" of religion, a Glasnost as it were, and suddenly Saint Nicholas experienced a new vogue; (fun fact: more British churches of any denomination are name for him than anyone else), to the extent that during Victoria's reign, he began to be associated with the burgeoning festivities surrounding Christmas. (His iconography and hagiography here is relevant, but I won't go into it now). 

Ashamed of betraying the reformed roots, the wider Protestant population were afraid to celebrate one of the papist saints by associating him with such a joyous time, so they hijacked the bastardization ""San Iclas"", which had, as is natural with the evolution of language, become ""Santa Claus"". Even then however, many preferred to use the Euphemism ""Father Christmas"". 

Catholics fought it for some time, but eventually they succumbed to social pressures and resumed the worship of their old friend Saint Nicholas, reverting to his original name as laid down in the Calendar of Saints.

Now how is this relevant? Amy, a young girl from the North East of Scotland, a region in which Catholicism was prevalent until long after the 1560 reformation, who moved to a sleepy English village in which the only church is likely to be Anglican, with only a distracted aunt to shore up her knowledge of her nieces faith, Amy misremembers teachings from her nursery school, and instead of praying to Saint Nicholas for intercession with God, she prays to Santa Claus.",0,1300171210,null,0,false,0,c1ksgzr,t3_g41y0,t1_c1ksgzr,t3_g41y0,1426986529,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

Now that Murdoch is being permitted to acquire the rest of BSkyB (except for Sky News), it cannot even be said to be a British company. Note that the US does not permit such extensive ownership of media by foreign nationals.

I have seen the free-for-all in the US. Yes, some good programs emerge but on the whole the presentation is rubbish. Despite subscriptions most channels carry so many adverts that it makes following a complex story challenging.

You mention shows that are successful with a segment of the population. They are cheap to produce, extremely profitable but ultimately free of any real merit. How many times have you seen reruns of a quiz show? The best is that the format can be resold.

The UK has produced some excellent costume drama. Would it do so without the influence of the BBC or would the content go down towards ever more quiz shows? Funnily enough the costume drama makes money too, but it is the long-tail rather than short-term profits.

Yes, I am in favour of a certain amount of cultural promotion (note, not protectionism) not only does it foster talent but it also makes money in other ways such as the selling of the English language (English as a foreign language is a major export) and tourism.

You mention that culture is in a state of flux, which is very true. I don't need another run of the classics but I do want TV like ""The Singing Detective"", ""Pennies from heaven"" and ""Edge of Darkness"". I want historical drama like ""Brideshead"". Funnily enough, of these titles two came from commercial TV. Would they have come without a state broadcaster is another matter?

I agree that people should be able to watch what they want. However, media is packaged. It is very difficult for me to buy what I want from a broadcaster as channels are not geared yet to sell a little of this and a little of that.

Lastly, one area of state sponsorship has come to an end under this government. There will be a lot less wasting of money on enterprises such as ""The King's Speech"".",0,1300185910,null,0,false,0,c1ksz1s,t3_g3fu0,t1_c1ksz1s,t1_c1ksueq,1428205329,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It has nothing to do with nukes. China has only recently become wealthy, same with India. Russia was in very bad shape after the cold war ended. Pakistan is the odd one on your list, we pay them money, but not because of the nukes, we pay them to stop the (relatively) Western friendly government from collapsing and Islamic radicals seizing power, which would impact operations in Afghanistan and probally result in a war with India, which would drag China and the US into play.

The most important thing you need to remember is that the UK is a very rich nation, we have one of the best qualities of life on the planet. Despite all the cuts things are still pretty good here.

One of the big problems of aid historically is that it perpetuates corrupt and incompetent government and that it makes leaders of recipient nations look to please western donors rather than their own people.

I would say that there are a few exceptions though, for cases of ""self serving"" aid.  It has got to be worth promoting peace and stability in places like Kashmir when local governments cant/wont for complex political reasons if only to reduce the chance of nuclear war or the conflict being used as a recruiting tool for extremists.

Overall I think that aid should be more concentrated than it is even now.  I would like to see the UK agree 5 and 10 year plans to focus almost all our aid on a few nations with the agreement of locals and see a real, coherent plan for places to work themselves out of poverty rather than a mish-mash of little projects doing some good here and there.

Takeaway usually offer only part time work to native Brits, and even then it's on minimum wage. You can't live on that. And if it's a second job then the tax will be so high that it's just not worth doing.

If we had done that for BR then I think they would have been just as good.  And even then, it has only been the massive focus on reliability (the overall measure of lateness and cancellations etc) over the last few years that has improved that.

As for telecoms, you do realise that virtually all broadband is actually provided by BT right?  Other companies buy it off them and sell it to you, that’s why all the packages are so similarly priced, they are buying from BT (who also sell on but only at the price set by Ofcom so that other companies can compete), whacking on their % and selling it to you and I.

Im too young to remember BT as it was but Im willing to accept it was pretty badly run.  My issue is that nothing has changed, its just under new management.  You can sort out the management without selling something.  That is what shareholders do with private companies and its what government *should* be doing with all public services.

I cant comment on your experiences of the NHS but I am sure that the US system would be no better.  Since it would be the same people running everything you would still not see the same GP (do Americans even have GPs?) twice but you would probably have had scans or treatment by now, but then could you have afforded it when it was charged at 100 times the rate the NHS costs and your insurer refused to payout because you once stubbed your toe and might have had a cold when you were 12 but did not inform them?

The truth is that things in the UK work.

They are not perfect, they could often be improved but I think that that is a slow, evolutional process, you solve nothing by big sweeping changes, especially when they are driven by ideology rather than practical responses (like the rail privatisation was, Thatcher said it would never work and she was right).

&gt;I think you didn't actually read a single word I wrote, because you're still displaying that derisive attitude. People will do any job for a fair wage.

You clearly haven't heard about the UK benefits system. Not to be unduly *derisive*, I know there are genuine people out there looking for jobs. But, I guess this debate kind of sums up my point: instead of people looking for ways to make themselves more attractive to employers, they're sitting on their hands blaming immigrants.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; It's a bit ludicrous to suggest that immigrants with work permits are paid below minimum wage without bringing up any backing evidence.

This is actually [a very common practice](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6593321.stm), and often the low wages are justified by the employer housing their employees in accomodation above a shop, or feeding them.

&gt; I'll concede that some business owners may bring in family members to work for them. How is that different from the Brit who employs his own relatives?

Very true, and I'll concede that. However, I don't think these guys form the majority.

&gt; where in the UK will this not be an issue?

Anywhere outside of a city centre. In the town where I live there are two of each type of takeaway at most, that's sufficient room without even competing.

The point I was trying to get at is that there are more ways of differentiating a business than price alone. Quality of ingredients, portion control, taste; they all make a difference in how people choose and quite often people are willing to pay more for these things.

&gt; True; but it's narrow to not consider that they may not be able to pay what is ""fair"" in your opinion.

Fair in my opinion? My opinion is irrelevent in this. Minimum wage is a legal obligation, and that's all I would expect them to pay.

But you are right, they may not be able to pay such wages. But such a situation requires a new business model, not simply closing doors.

&gt; But if business is down, won't they have to get rid of some staff?

Or they could get their sales staff to look at new avenues or new clients - something they should actively be doing anyway. Business is not a passive process.

&gt; You clearly haven't heard about the UK benefits system.

Haha, I most definitely have. In fact, you and I see eye-to-eye on many of these points and, as a former employer, it's kind of a rare experience for me to be speaking in favour of entry level workers :)

Seriously though, I'm not really advocating higher wages for unskilled work, what I am saying is that a business should not be operated in such a way that paying *minimum wage* would risk bankruptcy.

It indicates that the business has been built on unfair working practices, and in some cases, may have forced other businesses in the area to adopt similar practices in order to compete, and that's unacceptable.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; As for telecoms, you do realise that virtually all broadband is actually provided by BT right? Other companies buy it off them and sell it to you, that’s why all the packages are so similarly priced, they are buying from BT (who also sell on but only at the price set by Ofcom so that other companies can compete), whacking on their % and selling it to you and I.

That isn't true.

ISPs can provide ADSL on BT's network in a few ways:

LLU - where the ISP owns its own equipment in every telephone exchange from which it wants to provide a service. The ISP pays BT to rent space/electricity in the exchange, to have their equipment connected to customer lines, and to rent the customer line from BT. It is often cheaper than using BT's network and lets them provide services that they couldn't do through BT.

BTwholesale ADSL - this is where the ISP rents DSLAM ports (one per customer line) from BT, and also rents ""central pipes"" which are the interconnections that allow data to/from customers to be transferred to the ISP's own network. BT is only providing the means to get data to/from the customer, not the actual internet connection.

BT ""central plus"" - where the ISP really does resell a BT service that provides internet connectivity - the Post Office is one example, and it probably does it because it requires the ISP to have little infrastructure of their own.

Ofcom set the prices for LLU and BTwholesale services.

So, your assertion that ""virtually all broadband is provided by BT"" is wrong. Depending on the product used, BT provides aspects of the connection but it is up to the ISP to price it and provide the actual internet connectivity.",0,1300216629,null,0,false,0,c1kuxuc,t3_g44pf,t1_c1kuxuc,t1_c1ktgiq,1426987692,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,SEMW,null,null,"&gt; Honest opinion is bullshit. Declaring that homopathic medicine has no scientific basis is a fact.

Fact (aka truth, justification) *is* a valid defence.  It applies in different cases: you'd use truth as a defence if you made a statement of fact that was true; you'd use honest opinion as a defence if you were making a statement of opinion.

If you were referring to the Simon Singh case (which was chiropractic, not homeopathy), the chriopracter's claim was that he was making an assertion of fact (that they were being consciously dishonest).  That is something that would be pretty much impossible for Singh to prove.  The chriopracters' position was supported at a preliminary hearing, but Singh appealed the hearing, and won -- in appeal it was ruled that he was making a statement of opinion after all, and so could rely on the defence of fair comment.

&gt; The entire burden of proof in our system needs to move.

I kindof agree, in that there is a bit of an element of 'guilty until proven innocent' about the current system.  But I'm not sure how reversing the burden of proof would work.  E.g. say I publish a tabloid newspaper article saying ""G_Morgan is secretly a Nazi who drinks baby blood"", and you sue me for libel.  If the burden of proof was on you (rather than me as it is at the moment), how exactly could you prove that you're *not* secretly a baby-guzzling nazi?

true,EatBooks,null,null,"I completely agree with him about David Tennant and his more...rampant fans.  Look, the Tenth Doctor really defined the new series and I respect him for it.  The actor is extremely gifted and his looks, charm, and enthusiasm really make his episodes a joy to watch, no matter how dreary the material may be.

But Matt Smith is wonderful.  He's going to perfect the Doctor's character.  Or maybe he already has.  He's a better fit for the series, in many ways, turning Tennant's charm and enthusiasm into eccentricity and good naturedness.  He's a different Doctor, but one I--as of right now--prefer to any of the new incarnations.

I also agree with Welshy about the fifth series being the best constructed out of the new episodes.  It really is the best full story so far.

Saying that, I'm not sure I like that he mainly went for Smith's ""big"" moments, sometimes from the same episodes!  I love his speeches, too, but there are a lot of comparatively quiet scenes that really define the newest Doctor.  

One that really sticks out in my mind is from ""The Hungry Earth"" where Smith gets angry with Alaya for initially claiming she's the last of her species, saying that [he knows what it's *really* like to be the last and how ""it sits in the heart.""](/spoiler)  It's a great line.

Rose was a very needy girl. She was able to solve the puzzles in each episode, but ultimately, I think her character desired a constant companion, something should would have wasted her life aching for as she aged and the Doctor didn't. I was quite happy that she did get some semblance of what she wanted, even if the replicated Doctor wasn't *exactly* who she wanted.

Martha was intelligent and bright, in the beginning. The toll of wanting something more from the Doctor completely changed her character, resulting in someone hardened, wiser, and maybe a bit sadder. Sure she did find someone to love her, but I feel like her time with the Doctor did her character some disservice.

Donna, now I feel she was the perfect counterpart to the Doctor. She had it all, despite the fact that she felt not as smart and ""nothing special."" She helped to make the Doctor understand things about his line of work that Rose and Martha failed to impress upon him. It wasn't just about making sure history happens as it should, as in the episode regarding Pompeii, it was about compassion. She insisted on helping everyone, in any way she could. 

Also, Donna's personality was full of sass, and loved the Doctor in a platonic way.

true,animorph,null,null,"My favourite post about Martha (also found via Fuck Yeah Martha Jones):

While I have always loved Martha, I think that she suffered the same problem as I outlined with Lana: a fundamental lack of respect, and a lack of voice. Her function within the show seemed to be to highlight the ‘gap’ that Rose left in the Doctor’s life: she was defined by comparison and contrast with Rose — she was like this, you are like this — and disfavourably so by several characters and then again by commentators within fandom. While Martha had a great number of excellent qualities — she was a humanitarian, she was a medical student, she was exceptionally smart and determined and humbled — fandom insists on defining her by contrast to Rose (and later Donna) and in terms of her feelings towards the Doctor and vice versa.

I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen people argue that they would have liked Martha better if she hadn’t fallen in love with the Doctor and I just cannot understand what it is about falling in love which makes some female characters more sympathetic and others less sympathetic — and I cannot abide by this insidious idea that being in love ever diminishes a female character (or any character). I don’t think that Martha’s reaction to her feelings for the Doctor reflected badly on her and while it upsets me that the writers gave her feelings for the Doctor only as a way to kick her in the teeth on a weekly basis for no reason of either character development or plot I don’t think that it’s a reflection on her as a character. The writers didn’t often bother to highlight her brilliance, her self-sufficiency, her compassion, or her determination and while I would have liked the focus to have been on her rather than on her one-sided relationship with the Doctor and while I would have liked to have seen the show through her eyes rather than seeing her through the Doctor’s eyes — none of this makes Martha a bad character; it just makes her a character who was unfairly treated by the writers. But she still had all of those amazing traits which people wilfully overlook in their dismissals of her. Because you know what? Martha Jones is a rockstar.

I work long hours, I have to because everyone else does, so if I want to buy a house or have other nice things, its compete or do without.  In mainland Europe the working week is limited to 36 hours (plus more bank holidays than us, more leave, longer maternity, paternity leave, earlier retirement etc).  So while other, equally technological, nations still have time to relax, we brits leave early and return home late and tired.  Thats one reason I dont know my neighbours, I dont have time.

We have also purposefully concentrated work into London so that adds travel time to most peoples long days.

Plus, with a housing market like ours, my home is not just a home, its an investment too.  I will move every 5 years to try and get the biggest return on investment (with pensions evaporating this is the only way most of us will have a retirement).  So its not like there can be a community really, if everybody moved every 5 years.

I would also add that failed multiculturalism (let me be clear, I mean people choosing not to integrate for whatever reason) means that I will never have much relationship with a lot of people in the place I live since they are here for a few years, working even longer hours than me for less money and then plan to return to wherever they came from.

My overall point:  Society is gone, partly for technological reasons but also for cultural and political ones.  So it is a bit late to start bemoaning the fact no one has street parties anymore.  If that is really a problem then we need to do more than wag our fingers at people and say ""why dont you know your neighbours?"".  We need to re-examine the whole basis of our economic and social policies.

You *chose* to work a long way away from your home (or to put it another way, to live a long way from work).  You *choose* to move every few years.  You *chose* to give up after one vague and slightly ham-fisted overture to your neighbours, etc. ;-)

I appreciate that you made an overture to your elderly neighbours, but it would seem to be obvious that the easiest way to do this is to say hello in daylight - tabloid hysteria about crime is a genuine problem (especially for older people) that discourages socialising, but it's not remotely insurmountable.

FWIW I think we broadly agree - the nature of society is changing, and it's for a combination of technological and cultural/social/psychological reasons.  And I also agree that non-integrative multiculturalism was probably a bad idea (it reminds me entirely too much of ""separate but equal"", and we all know how well *that* turned out), because it only works when you assume everyone already buys into the same core values that the country's culture is built on (freedom of speech, equality, secularity, etc), or at least will refrain from campaigning to change the laws to better reflect those of their homeland.

However, the important thing to remember is that *you can still befriend people and get to know your neighbours* if you care enough and are willing to put some effort in.

It's impossible to go straight into high quality manufacturing. When a country has low skills (like the UK has now) they have to start with low quality goods and then move onto higher quality.

The UK can't compete with 3rd world nations in low quality goods because of wages.

So we would need either high government subsidies or a large drop in the minimum wage (neither of which are likely to happen).

My point has primarily and always been that it should be more attractive to work than not. Exclude (just for the moment) unemployment caused by the recession; we have failed to address the problem of a lack of suitable jobs - this made worse by providing benefits for the unemployed without creating employment opportunities. 

So out of necessity, benefits need to be marginally worse than if you were to be in unemployment. Maybe some sort of credit for those who have been employed and through no fault of their own find themselves out of work?

Edit. Been looking at the sickness numbers. The new Atos tests are quite ruthless, however those appealing successfully against decisions are quite high. Even on those figures though, a conservative estimate of those forced to rejoin the jobs market would seem to be around the 800k to 1m mark. Unemployment on those figures could see a figure approaching 5m. Further, there are likely to areas with historical poverty that rely on state sector employment where the proportion of unemployed will be far higher.

 I'm fairly certain, or at least I hope, these additions will be staggered as the government hope for the economy to pick up, but the measures being introduced are considered generally a hell of a gamble.

You do not have to register to place an ad on Gumtree so that leaves it wide open to fraudsters &amp; scammers. [Here](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/bargains-and-rip-offs/article.html?in_article_id=517391&amp;in_page_id=5) is an article about how the property scammers on Gumtree operate.

&gt; Gumtree.com is a popular choice for those looking to rent and as such has become home to scammers looking to rip them off. A close call with these con artists showed me how they operate.

This is just one example of the elaborate scams on Gumtree.

Now Gumtree have been forced to check the ads before they go live to make sure there are no scams, this does not work because the scams are still getting though and honest punters end up waiting for days or weeks in some cases for their ads to be posted.

Have a look at the Gumtree [feedback forums](http://forums.gumtree.com/viewforum_f_6_Gumtree_Feedback) to see what the main complaints are.

* Ad Processing for days... Why? 
* Ads stuck in processing forever - giving up. 
* Cannot post ad - stuck in processing
* Why after 6days is my ad being processed 
* 5 ads, 5 days processing, 2 requests for help HELP 

These are just a few examples of the problems people are facing on Gumtree.

We are not saying that we have the solution, but we believe that by forcing people to register we will cut down on the scammers as users will have to pay £1 to register to prove that they have a UK address.

Any ads our users post go onto the site immediately.

If we have any scammers on the site we will delete their account and ban them as well as their address, email address, user name etc.

Yes!  They don't realise how lucky they are.

I think it would be possible to have a political system where a cross-party committee of people chose the next head of state/governor general.  According to Wikipedia the current prime minister nominates the GG and ""may consult privately with staff or colleagues"" in doing so.  Any outrageously corrupt nomination (eg the PM's uncle, or the chairman of her brother's company) would clearly backfire politically and electorally.  It wouldn't be hard to codify some kind of ""conflict of interest"" bar.

true,Peskie,essex,Essex,"Here's a scenario where the Police didn't approach the children (there were three one 10 and one six and a four year old - funny they didn't mention the other two children in the headline!) 

You go up to the children and tell them off - politely of course - that's probably what the newspaper calls  accosting. Their parents come storming over as they see an adult talking to their children. You get an earful of defensive abuse if not physical despite you pointing out that their child was causing wonton damage to property they didn't own. You'll probably be called a paedophole or pervert and then they call the police and you get arrested for interfering with the children's destructive play. The newspaper headline now reads 'Paedophile arrested for accosting children in park' no mention of the reason why or details of the damage they've done.

It's much better that this issue is dealt early with by police officers before the children have the potential to graduate to spray painting the local shop shutters/windows because she doesn't instil in them a respect for the environment and other peoples property regardless if it's a place with public access as their parents don't seem to be taking any responsibility.

Also the headline is inaccurate and inflammatory with respect to the way it's written to make it seem that it's okay to pick flowers that don't belong to you and it's outrageous that its pointed out that it's called criminal damage and theft which is fairly accurate.

Personally I would rather call the Police than approach someone causing damage (child or not)  to my garden by picking my daffs. especially in todays society and especially when the mother thinks it's ok to let her three bored children play in the daffodils.

The good:  First, it looks damned good.  It really does. Matt Smith's screwdriver is a big screwdriver, and this is a good sized wii remote. I like the balance of this remote more than the typical wii remote.  It feels lighter at the front end which means that Playing ""Force Unleashed"" is much easier on my wrists.  I have big hands so I don't have a problem using the remote sideways for driving games.  But smaller hands do have a problem with this.  Reaching the buttons can be uncomfortable.  The battery charge seems to be quite excellent, holding well, not even one bar down after 3 hours.  I don't know how long charging took 'cuz I plugged it in and went to bed.

The bad:  It won't synch on it's own.  I have to use another wii remote to tell the wii to resynch and then it will recognize the sonic screwdriver (this may mean that my wii is deadlock sealed, I'm looking into this). Some of the buttons stick out more than on the other wii remotes.  I kept on bringing up the Wii menu in light sabre duels.  

All told, I'm very very happy with my sonic screwdriver.",0,1300333678,null,0,false,0,c1l2qxj,t3_g5mmv,t1_c1l2qxj,t3_g5mmv,1426991440,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Barca are definitely another team we should want nothing to do with. BAE defending Messi gives me nightmares, much as i love him lol. 

I feel like If we play Inter, they would be at an advantage, since they already played us and know what to expect, and injuries are making us weaker than when we played them in group. So i don't want to play them. 
For United and Chels, it is a similar story. They know us well, and know how to deal with us. Out of the two, I would rather chelsea. With Torres not contributing and them struggling to find a formation that will work with him and their other personal, now is an opportune time to face and beat them.

As far as Shaktar goes, i feel like we would do better on the artificial field this time around, so I wouldn't mind playing them actually.

We wanted to make things as simple as possible when registering so we don't actively verify sellers by phone, address etc. Our philosophy is to ask people to pay £1 to register, when they do this they have to provide an address, we only accept registered users from the United Kingdom. We also track the ip address of everyone who registers, so and registrations from outside the UK are deleted (the seller gets their £1) back.

If a seller abuses their account and scams people we will delete their account, yes they can re-register, but not with the same card details, address, email address, telephone number, user name, or real name. We realise that this won't stop everyone, but it should be an effective deterrent.

There are advantages to not having a registration system for sellers, but then again it opens it up to everyone, I have spoken to a few Gumtree users and a lot of them were frustrated by the amount of rubbish that they found on Gumtree, particularly the property scam. Additionally, Gumtree have to check ads before they can go live, this leads to delays that are time consuming and affect the genuine users, all our ads go live immediately as well as any updates.

Once a seller has registered and paid their £1 they can place as many ads as they want for free. There are also various ways to promote your ad (homepage focus, featured, highlighting, uplisting etc.), to do this you must purchase AppleCactus credits (you get 100 if you sign up during the initial launch phase, 30 normally). With Gumtree you have to pay for each ads promotional individually, with AppleCactus you can buy credits and use them to promote all or some of your ads, you just top up your account with more credits when you need some more, it saves having to enter your card details every time you want to promote your ad/s.

* Make it clear its FREE (or £1)
**This is explained when you click on register, we are going to add a banner to the front page shortly.**

* Use City and Item Name in URL?
**Good idea, wee speak to the coder.**

* How a redirect telephone? - when sale ends telephone no longer public.
**This is in our phase 2 plan, we will probably charge credits for this service.**

* Seller Verification - (see flippa.com)
**We will run with the system we have for now and see how it goes.**

* Create a Listing API (if not your property section will suffer)
**Not entirely sure what you had in mind here.**

* Add Postcode Data, for Search
**Already in there**


* Strange Domain, no?
**Yes, we chose AppleCactus because it's international, it's actually a type of cactus from Peru that bears a red fruit (http://imgur.com/SmuHI) website is red &amp; green. And one of the main reasons is that the domain was available and the search engines should pick up things pretty quickly.**
**I agree it doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, but the feedback has generally been positive so far and their are benefits to having a fairly unique name.**

**Copied from another reply to save me time :-)**

* During Start-up Process, Work with other Classified Websites API to bolster up listings.
**Great idea.**

1) The Toughies (IMO): Barca, Inter, Madrid

2) The Might Put Up a Fight (IMO): Tottenham, Man Poo

Obviously the last group is the best so i'd have to go with either of those teams...


In all seriousness I would group Chelsea with the toughies, cause we always put on so much effort when he hit this stage of the CL which makes us tough to beat.

No it isn't.

My point is that it is worst for those from poor families that do well, as they end up being saddled with huge amounts of debt, as those from wealthy families can just pay it off immediately, meanwhile those who do stupid courses and party for 3 years barely pay anything at all.

So it is the hard-working students from poorer families who are hit the hardest. It's an awful system and I'm very happy that I was lucky enough to get to university before it is implemented.

A tax system is not supposed to punish hard work and subsidise the lazy. Why is it even necessary to have this additional layer on top of income tax in the first place?",0,1300379164,null,0,false,0,c1l4r8s,t3_g5pqa,t1_c1l4r8s,t1_c1l4phn,1426992388,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London," I did my Royal Signals basic training at 16 and got to around week 12, broke my wrist badly and had to withdraw. They said that I could pick up again once my wrist had healed but by this time I'd completely changed my mind and didn't go back ( probably one of the best decisions I ever made )  If I'd stayed in I would have then shifted to a 36 week communications engineers course so basically my six months would have been up well before I'd finished training. 

In respect to this they're asking kids ( In the Signals ) to sign contracts well before they've finished training. IMO the cooling off period should be at least a year if not more, but the Army I guess don't want to spend all that money training you for you to just leave.  

The other question here though is: Is 16 too young to become a soldier? I'd say no, basic training is fucking tough, after about 10 weeks you become probably the fittest and most alert you'll ever be in your life and by this point you've grown up fast, you go from boy to man in a very short period of time. Personally I didn't find myself too young to get through it, although I may have had a very different opinion if I'd been thrown into the deep end in the Gulf war which, if I'd stayed is what would have happened. I know a lot of my Northern mates were never the same when they came back from the Gulf, in fact I'd go as far as to say they came back complete fucking nutters.

Basically, we felt that when people have great ideas and great skills (either in starting up a business, or doing work in the local community - which then grows into a bigger ongoing concern), the legal aspect can sometimes be problematic as people are typically uncertain of how to go about it, and they are also stopped from growing because they can't navigate this field properly. You need to be a legal entity to get a business bank account, for example.

With that, my friends and I have created OneClickOrgs - a free system that allows for the easy formation of an Association. An Association, as a legal entity, can help you get a bank account etc, amongst other things.

In addition, we have a self-modifying constitution, and the ability to invite new members to join the association, as well as the ability to run day-to-day decision making.

We did all of this because basically we thought it would be a good thing to help anybody in the UK who is either helping other people, or who is starting up a small business and doesn't want to get bogged down in legalese until much later - when they are a more mature organisation.

I can buy disposable, top up cards from the internet or post office. I think PayPal can generate them online. So this verification is, dare I say useless.

Personally, I'd say there's no need to watch them in order. In fact, I'd say it's better to watch a bit of every Doctor, just to get a feel for them. And those very long 12-parters (""The Daleks"") in the black and white era can be a bit of a bore sitting through in one go (they were of course never meant to be seen back-to-back like that.. and it honestly kinda shows).

So.. pick a few out of those lists there, one for each Doctor maybe. That's how I started collecting Classic Who: order sets of ~7, aiming every time to get one of each Doc. I found it the best way to keep it 'fresh', and not get stuck on one particular TARDIS crew.

The Doctor, after all, knows that he may be the good guy in most of his adventures, but not all of them.  Being powerful means having to regulate yourself, after all.

7.) *The Big Bang*. [Seeing the Doctor dance at Amy and Rory's wedding is terribly sweet.  Also, being a mentor to children is simply one of his strong suits, you know?  Even if he's showing them one of the worst dances in the universe.](/spoiler)

6.) The Doctor doing Craig's job in *The Lodger*.  The football scene made me cringe and feel embarrassed for poor Craig, who obviously didn't know what he was getting into when he agreed to have the Doctor live with him.  I understand he just doesn't like being upstaged by an alien with two hearts and twice the ability at kicking a ball around a grassy field.  But watching the Doctor actually work in Craig's office made me crack a smile.  Eleven is a maverick and the strangest things just come naturally to him.  

5.) In *Cold Blood*, the Doctor setting up the discussion between Nasreen and Amy and the [Silurian race](/spoiler) and then stepping back.  The diplomacy was elegant even if the audience may have to wait for the pay-off.

4.) In *Vincent and the Doctor*, Eleven tries to talk to Van Gogh about depression and why it can be very challenging.  Vincent, who's preparing to paint, shushes him and the Doctor relents.  I think this moment sums up a lot about the Doctor's career as a time traveler.  He often interferes, but sometimes he just has to go with the flow of things.

3.) In *The Pandorica Opens*, the Doctor and Amy attempt to outwit pieces of a Cyberman.  The exchange in which the Doctor admits this isn't one of his better plans and then leaps out, yelling how he's a distraction, is brilliant.

2.) *Vincent and the Doctor*, again.  [The trip to the future to show Vincent how his paintings have survived him.  Maybe this is more of a series moment?  I'm not sure, but it's one of my favorites.  It was very moving to watch the Doctor's delight at Vincent's reactions.](/spoiler)

1.) *The Big Bang*, again.  Because fezzes really are cool.  Also, the Doctor showing up [to help out River Song after she's been on a time loop in the Tardis for two thousand years](/spoiler) is the stuff of sci-fi fairy tales.  I knew at that point that I wanted Moffat to write for the series until forever.

BONUS. (11th?)  The deleted scene from *The Hungry Earth* where the Doctor admits to Amy that he [likes Rory. A lot.](/spoiler) It's so sad they had to cut that part out.  I think it's important to establish the Doctor's relationships with all of his companions.  Maybe spelling it out was too obvious?  Or maybe they just filmed it later and said it was deleted to appease the fans?

** *The First Doctor* **


Runner-up: **Beating the Game of Rassilon with his 2nd, 3rd, and 5th incarnations, outsmarting them all in the process, in *The Five Doctors* **- Runner up only because I find it hard to endorse Richard Hurndall as the First Doctor. He just isn't the Hartnell I know and love. That said, the Doctor's quick mind in this episode backs up my theory of the First Doctor as an academic with an intellectual mind, rather than just an intelligent one

10. **Kidnapping Ian and Barbara in *An Unearthly Child* ** - Well this started it all didn't it? It has to be in here, and the introduction to a frankly disconcerting old man who is at once troubling and familiar to many is done very well. 

9. **Losing the Mercury fluid-links in *The Daleks* ** - He may be a petulant and crotchety old man, but this is the first time that he shows the real inquisitive nature that later incarnations would. The fact he does so by basically damaging the TARDIS seems anathema to us now, but serves only to underline how young and inexperienced this old man really was.

8. **Apologising to Barbara at the end of *The Edge of Destruction* ** - I think this is the moment that defines the First Doctor for me. Not only does he sacrifice his pride to do what is right, he does so after being scolded and isn't ashamed of it. The first time his golden heart shows through the cold and callous exterior, and you can tell from here on in that he begins to show real affection for Barbara

7. **Breaking the Monk's TARDIS, first in *The Time Meddler*, and later (and even more epically) in *The Dalek's Master Plan* ** - This is quite refreshing when compared to the 10th Doctor. He's met another Time Lord, and he disapproves of his actions, but instead of forgiving him, he decides to play a practical joke on him. His knowledge of the inner workings of a TARDIS underline his scientific side (though I, perhaps territorially, think of him as having been a historian back on Gallifrey) that would come to the fore in his 3rd incarnation, also suggests that he is perfectly capable of fixing and flying the TARDIS perfectly, he just choses not to for the sake of adventure.

6. ** Hiding from the Moroks in *The Space Museum* ** - Could you imagine any other Doctor hiding inside a hollowed out Dalek and then impersonating one to himself? I thought not. The First Doctor has a wonderful sense of humour when he wants to.

5. **Making some Cocoa and getting engaged in *The Aztecs* ** - An easy mistake to make, and though you feel sorry for Cameca, it's obvious that Barbara has had a positive effect on the Doctor. Instead of brushing her off as he would probably have done had this serial ocurred even half a series earlier, he lets her down gracefully and allows her to keep her dignity

4. **Fooling Nero with the harp in *The Romans* ** - While I may disagree with the portrayal of Nero and his entourage (Tigellinus was a badass, not a simpering idiot), the artful way the Doctor gets around an awkward situation is a testament to his character, and shows that he doesn't need the Sonic ~~deus ex machina~~ screwdriver

3. **""So you're my replacements — a dandy and a clown!"" from *The Three Doctors* ** - His very presence is enough to quell the arguments between the ever quarrelsome Second and Third Doctors, and as much as I love the Second, the First blows him out of the water in terms of authority. As a side note, the First's presence in this serial breaks my heart a little, because Hartnell clearly was not long for this world, and he just couldn't bring the character he had created back.

2. **""Up there is the scanner, those are the doors, that is a chair with a panda on it. Sheer poetry, dear boy! Now please stop bothering me!"" from *The Time Meddler* ** - I have to admit that while Barbara is my favourite Companion, Steven and Vicki are my favourite combo, and combining Steven's disbelief with my affinity for Pandas, this witty put down becomes one of the best lines in Who history (losing only to *How is Harvey Wallbanger one word?!*

1. **Fighting off not one, but two assasins in *The Romans* ** - Come on, how is this not Awesome. The First Doctor is by this point the back of 400, while he looks good for his age, he's clearly not a spry young man. The assasins clearly doen't think he is either, and the fact he manages to fight them off armed only with his walking stick, having tremendous fun at the same time makes shows just how much ass the First Doctor can kick, which once again, is a vast improvement on the torment of the New Series.

&gt;I'd like to keep my complaint simple:  

&gt;Outcasts was a quality sci-fi drama that started out slow, but picked up the pace and ended well. It's unjust that the show be cancelled due to ""poor ratings"" when one considers the re-scheduling of the show to an inconvenient time-slot had no doubt turned away a few viewers that missed the later great episodes.  

&gt;I must also ask, were BBC iPlayer ratings taken into account with this decision? I know myself and many others within my demographic (young, IT-orientated, too busy for TV) prefer to watch things via the iPlayer service, and a program such as this would have no doubt generated a good following both via the live-broadcast and iPlayer viewings of it.  

&gt;I ask of you BBC, comission a second series and let the show recover. I have absolutely no-doubt that expanding upon those final episodes would attract more viewers than the first series managed to do. You obviously thought this show was of good enough quality to commission the first time around; continue to support quality, don't work off the ratings when you certainly caused them to decrease with the re-scheduling.

true,hennell,null,null,"I'm going to mention at the start here I saw maybe 20 mins of the first episode of Outcasts. Didn't get into it; stopped watching (That's how I roll, sorry). I've heard there's some pretty bad reviews, but lets ignore that to talk of figures:


The show did have poor ratings. CBA to look them up, but pretty sure they averaged about 12%~ of the total audience (~3million or so) and around 45%~ down from the BBC1 standard for that time slot.

TV wise that's somewhat embarrassing, and given the less then impressed critical response was unlikely to change. And a series-arc show gives an increasing barrier to new viewers anyway, making a significant rise almost impossible. 

I've no idea if iPlayer views were considered, my guess is the execs would look at them before canning a show; but moving a show in the schedules is very rare for a UK channel, especially with a prime show like Outcasts. Whatever numbers they could see can't have been good.

You've also got to note the TV 'politics' at play; Danny Cohen has been BBC1 controller for a couple of months. Given his public comments that the show was 'a misfire' I'm guessing he had no big part in it's commissioning; maybe he chose to promote it maybe not, either way he's chosen to cancel it. That's his big stamp; his sign ""I make the decisions now, and I'm not above making the tough ones (If cancelling a low-rated, critical mauled show is 'tough').

My point to this wall of text is A) I like discussing media matters :D and B) You have almost 0% chance of getting it back. Harsh I know (I believe it had a cliff hanger ending?) but that's TV. If it had been Cohen's baby, maybe it'd have got a reprieve; if there was more media support it might have had a chance; but risking media backlash about wasting 'licence payers money' over a little watched show won't be worth it.

My suggestions to you are; contact the writer and tell him how much you enjoyed the show. Tell the BBC/Kudos (?) how much you'd like a radio series/ comic book continuing the story. I can't see it back on TV, but a cheaper medium with a ~2million audience 'head start' is plausible. (BBC7(Or rather: radio4extra) have a lot of sci-fi slots, and you might be able to get it on there). Campaign for an dvd/itunes release which is more likely (having the content and all.)

Maybe you could get them to change their minds, but I really doubt it. It's a public enough story, it would be very embarrassing to bring it back now, unless they were really really confident it will trounce the competition. At that's just impossible. Sorry, just how I see it. (Also sorry for the masses of text. I find this story very interesting)

But what made me get into it--like REALLY into it, watching seasons/series one after another--was a combination of three episodes watched out of order.  They were:

1.) The latter half of *The Big Bang*.  I didn't know what was going on, but I knew I liked it and finally understood what the fuss was about.  The pace was exciting, too.  It spoiled me--TERRIBLY--but it was worth it.

2.) *Blink*. Not my first Tennant, but it helped me realize that if it wasn't just *The Big Bang* that was exciting, maybe the rest of the series was worth a try.  Also, I'm a sucker for horror movies with happy endings.

3.) *A Christmas Carol*.  The story took hold of me and I'm not sure it's let go, yet.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"Actually it goes down like this:

There are 12 biscuits. The worker has one biscuit, but before he can do anything with  it the government demands he hands over nearly half of it.

""Where's my cut?"" says the government.

The worker hands over half the biscuit to smash up into crumbs to be distributed amongst the poor, civil service workers and on pointless projects that serve no real purpose.

The bank takes 8 of the biscuits, then creates packages containing certificates based on the perceived value of the biscuits and sells these certificates, so that people can trade on the perceived value. The bank then takes out insurance on the biscuits, packages these certificates up, the sells the other side. From the 8 biscuits, the bank makes more than the entire GDP of the whole world, but no-one notices.

""Where's my cut?"" asks the government.

The bank has more money than god. No, seriously - the catholic church, impressed with the money making capabilities of the bank moves it's assets to the biscuit bank. The bank buys the tin and biscuit factory to offset it's UK-based profits, but uses a complex system of structured investment vehicles to mitigate the tax and gives the government 4 biscuits, because that's what the government's seen the bank take. Nothing so far is illegal. The bank then starts lending biscuits at super cheap rates to the worker so he can buy houses, like the ones he's seen on channel 4 property shows. The banker is happy, the worker is happy, the government is happy.

Suddenly the worker, the government and the banker realise that the certificates the banker sold to the government aren't as valuable as they thought they were (certainly not as valuable as the world's entire GDP) and the value drops to what they were, which is bits of paper. Bits of paper are worth less than options on future biscuits. The bank goes into a tailspin. The government shouts, ""MAKE IT STOP!"" - the bank can't.

The bank borrows 6 biscuits from the government, who had to open a new packet of hob nobs it magically created out of thin air. These 'imaginary hob nobs' don't taste of anything and are largely invisible, but for accounting purposes are listed as being on the table. The government now owns the majority of the bank, paid for with imaginary hob nobs.

The banker is depressed, the government is worried, the worker looks at the table and is confused. He takes his half biscuit, declares he's leaving the table and wants to keep what he has as far away from the banker and government as possible.

""This was all your fault!"" - claims the worker. ""Everything was good before, but now my biscuit property empire is crumbling as I can't afford to pay the interest and I've lost my job, all because you made loads of money and I'm not making any.

Don't just dick around during the away match. Being offensive and grabbing a goal, even at the cost of a 2-1 loss away, is worth it nine times out of ten. A 1-1 draw away, is more often than not a small victory due to the away goals rule. Because you know that when you come to the home game, the visiting team will have to be offensive in order to get anything out of the game. And that opens up space for attacks.

If you let a team come over knowing that they only need to play with a compact formation with two full backs, six central defenders, a defensive midfielder and a striker, then they will.

One glaringly obvious option is missing:
What if they're your same sex partner, but you don't have a civil
partnership?

Surely that would be ""Same sex partner""?

Dear Sarah

The 2011 Census form is the result of lengthy consultation with census
users and has been thoroughly tested.

It is not possible to provide a separate tickbox for every variable or
scenario, due to space constraints on the form. However, it will be
possible to produce counts for same sex partnerships, as this information
can be deduced by cross analysis of the responses to the relationship and
sex questions.

Please contact us again if you require any further assistance.

Finally, when you initially wrote to us, we sent you an automated response
with a selection of links to our website. Did you use them? Did you find
them useful? Any feedback you can give us so that we can improve our
service would be much appreciated.

Regards

Graduating High School is in NO WAY the same as completing the equivalent qualifications in the UK.  Pupils leave school in the UK with subject-specific qualifications, rigorously assessed according to national standards.  There might be a leaver's dance for 6th years/year 12s, and the pride comes at opening the results in August.

In the USA, ""students"" have to pass all classes with a D minimum, complete a service project and give a 5 minute presentation.  For that, they are awarded a diploma, wear academic caps and gowns, and march around to pomp and circumstance while parents weep in audience of whatever ernomodome graduation takes place in.  This is followed or preceded by a lavish prom.  It's ludicrous.  And the number of students that aren't able to meet those requirements is equally confounding.

My absolute **favorite** is the ""Hello. I am the Doctor,"" scene from 'The Eleventh Hour.' The cinematography, the score, and the script all underscore Matt Smith's first true monologue beautifully - it really stunned me. Gives me chills to this day.

Another really great one, perhaps my favorite in the Tennant era, is in Girl in the Fireplace. After [the Doctor smashes through the window, defeats the Clockwork machines, and realizes he's 'trapped,' Reinette shows him the fireplace and the Doctor patches it. As he spins around, he says,](/spoiler) ""Wish me luck!"" to which Reinette replies, ""...no.""

It happens so quickly, and it always strikes me down. There's so much pain in Reinette's voice and it is explained so subtly and with absolute succintness. Then, the immediate blow appears on Tennant's face, as if every time he ever flitted in and out of someone's life came back in one go.

That scene really, really sold me on Tennant. It's less than ten seconds of interaction, but it's so pretty and painful that it made me love him as an actor (and Moffat as a writer).",0,1300463483,null,0,false,0,c1l8v08,t3_g611q,t1_c1l8v08,t3_g611q,1426994400,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

You can pick 5 courses with the exception of medicine, where you can only pick 4. Everyone then has to write a personal statement, no more than 4000 characters and list their qualifications. This is all done online.

Because in the uk, we gain grades in formal qualifications such and GCSEs and A-Levels, your course may stimulate certain requirements you have to meet. For example, a Chemistry degree may want an A in Alevel chemistry. This varies a lot depending on course and university prestige. 

However, you apply for university before you have sat your final exams, so universities rely on predicted grades and the personal statement. Some unis have interviews, some set their own entry tests. There's a fair bit of voodoo in the process, but there are two main offer types: conditional or unconditional. 

A lot of your application rests on unknowns: you cam be offered a place based on predicted grades, so come results day you may or may not have met the requirements of a conditional offer. Students then can go through a process called clearing if they do not meet the requirement of their backup choice or just don't hold any offers. Clearing let's you lobby unis for a place on a similar course with entry requirements that you do fulfill.

From having a kind of warden person on the floor in his halls of residence, to having to study for exams every single term. Even in the middle of terms they had exams. It really slowed down the pace of study, he found. He was put in some classes with postdocs, and he was ahead of them.

It's been ramping up every year since at least Sydney 2000, possibly earlier. I was reading on their site this week that for London 2012 you **cannot** pay with anything other than a Visa card. No cash, no cheques, and if you don't have a Visa card... they'll sell you and *let* you pay with a pre-paid Visa card. How kind.

The mobile phone thing will either be an ""Official Mobile Phone"" sponsor issue, or to do with cameras and image rights. Bottled water will be about ""Official Bottled Water"" sponsorship. They can use the security argument to ban all food/drink and sell you vastly overpriced products once you're inside - cinemas have been doing it for decades.

And even if you totally flunked your O Levels/GCSEs, you'd be out the door of school and would have to sort it out at a college.

In American schools, traditionally there was more chance of a student being held back while their classmates moved onto the next grade. You had to pass exams to move to the next grade. So actually finishing the final grade actually meant graduating. In practice it's more of a formality and kids are not held back very often.
