I think the main point here is that the daily telegraph is assigning the ruling to the EU who have nothing to do with the matter, it is just crappy journalism to fuel the anti EU sentiment and misleads the readers. (Especially if europhobes are going to use the judgement as an argument to get to get out of the EU without understanding that being in or out of the EU wouldn't make a difference to this situation).

true,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"I'm voting for AV for a few reasons. After looking at the results on the BBC's 2010 Election site on a constituency by constituency basis, you can see how, by roughly estimating what the second (and third) preferences of the losing parties are, the results can be wildly different. I'd like to see things shaken up a bit.

For example, by assuming a UKIP voter is likely to have a conservative as his second choice, the conservatives have a chance at winning in some seats. Likewise, the same can be said for Lib Dems with the Green Party, and Labour with the Lib Dems (a 40%/40% split between Lab and Con with 20% for the LD). The idea that a town full of people who have conservative (with a small C) preferences could lose to a small socialist minority because the vote was split amongst the Tories, UKIP and English Democrats is disheartening.

Secondly, I think ranking by preference will change how people vote. I have a feeling that a huge amount of people voted not with their hearts, but with the brains in the last election in an attempt to 'Not let Labour get back in', or 'Not let the bastard Conservatives ruin the country again', which resulted in people voting for the enemy of their enemy; who in many cases wasn't their friend. By listing by preference, smaller parties stand a chance at getting their deposit back as people are not scared of wasting their vote.

Lastly, I think the data gained from the new system would be tremendous. I have a thing for scouring data, and discovering that people who vote UKIP as a first preference also vote Green as a second preference (even before Tory!) would be so interesting. Interesting not just to me, but also to parties themselves. Think about it; if Labour knew that the majority of people who voted Green first, voted for Labour second, it would spur them on to develop a more comprehensive environmental policy.",0,1298938324,null,0,false,0,c1ir4vw,t3_fuj7p,t1_c1ir4vw,t3_fuj7p,1426951348,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Thats alot there! Perhaps you could take a road trip around the UK :) but either way as others have said you should visit a few; perhaps narrow down your choices?

I can't say much about the other places because I don't know them but I am from London so I straight away ruled out London universities (I have lived here all my life, and probably will move back post-university: I want to see the rest of the UK). So I visited lots of northern ones including Leeds. 

Leeds I really didn't like; there was nothing wrong with the university. It had a great department for my subject and a lovely library! But I didn't like being in the city (would that be a benefit to you?) due to it being so busy/night life extreme/ = city like.

That's why I chose York because it is close to the lovely town of York (and Leeds) but is seperate. A campus university with lots of green and a huge lake with ducks and swans walking about everywhere. 

Anyway, I strongly reccomend you visit! I would have applied to Leeds and maybe gone there and hated it.. because I wouldn't enjoy living there. but you might! So you should visit. You are living for a year in this place... which type of place would you like to live!

I disagree with you completely:

1) Simply don't put down a second choice

2) If having to wait longer for election results is not a price your willing to pay for a more representative democracy then fair enough, but if you go to the other extreme we should just put all the votes in a box and pick out a winner.

3) Are you really saying that you don't think the average British person can count in ascending or descending order without re-education! If you have such low expectations of your fellow man why vote at all.

""    Radio 4 operates, as so many British institutions do, on two levels. Its structures reflect the natural conservatism of the British people, but the world view of its guiding spirits is more naturally radical, leftish and Guardianista. From the Royal Opera House to the Foreign Office, the same combination of traditional outward forms legitimising bien-pensant attitudes is at work......

.....The leftish bias in Radio 4’s content manifests itself subtly, yet insistently. Voices from the far Left such as Linda Smith and Jeremy Hardy are introduced on the News Quiz, or given their own shows, in a way which gives no clue to their political shading. The station treats them as though they were souls with no mission save laughter, like Humphrey Lyttleton or Nicholas Parsons, but the humour of Smith, Hardy and others such as Mark Steel is deployed for a particular polemical and political purpose.""

I don't know where I'll be working afterwards, as I'll do my PhD in Greece and then see how it goes from there, but your words helped a lot!

Newcastle University is a Russell Group University, if you're concerned about the prestige of the institution, don't be. It also has one of the highest graduate employment rates in the country. I don't know about the specific course, but the University has an excellent reputation. Newcastle also has an international airport.

I wouldn't rule out any of the film / cinema / visual culture courses - yes, there aren't many jobs available in these exact fields but they will give you the same transferable skills as any of the other courses you're considering.

From your list, I think all of them would be fine choices (Birkbeck has a good reputation for your areas of interest) but I would lean towards Manchester or York. I have to disclose a bit of personal bias in the latter as the external examiner for my PhD was from York University (and teaches on that course). Of these, I'd imagine Manchester would be easier and cheaper to travel to than York.

If you're sure you want to do a PhD in the future:

* choose an MA course that will lead to an area you are prepared to spend 3+ years studying (i.e. the course content is more of a priority than the University itself)
* ask to speak to an Academic in the school you're considering for your MA about the route to a PhD - if you want to apply for funding, it will help you to let them know from Day 1
* find out whether they have a postgraduate mentoring scheme or other support programmes for making the transition to a PhD

and good luck!

It is worth remembering that this 'non-judgmental' insurance approach to risk assessment still leads to unfair off-sets. The sensible 17 year old driver has to massively off-set the idiot 17 year old who crashes.

Insurance companies aim to best assess the risk of paying out by using a plethora of risk factors which they then use to generate the premium. 

It strikes me as odd to claim that this is not judgemental. A judgement is made based on the statistical evidence available. I agree that it is not racist or sexist but is judgemental based on the risk factors used.

The question is whether those factors are acceptable. I think a useful dichotomy can be introduced: Individual choice risk factors; which would include type of car, size of enguine, the area they live in and group characteristic factors; race, gender physical characteristics.

The former seem acceptable as price determinants to me while that later do not. This is because the former do not punish someone because of a happenstance of their birth whereas the later do. 

Perhaps I am about to extend my argument beyond breaking point but another counterfactual would be a retailer introducing risk based pricing. Theft from stores reduces retailer’s margins. As things stand this cost is factored into the price which everyone pays. If a statistical analysis were to show that young black men were disproportionally likely to shoplift (or indeed people with red hair or green eyes) would we as a society find it acceptable for that retailer to charge a particular demographic higher prices to off-set the cost. Allowing them to charge individuals from other demographics, which are statistically less likely to have introduced the cost, a lower price.
I would argue that it is not because this pre-judges an individual based on a particular group characteristic. 

The same rationale leads me to believe it is unacceptable for insurers to pre-judge and differentially price based on group characteristics over which the individual has no control.

First of all, Jenny could potentially have other good stories just as she was as played by Georgia Moffett; no need to have another actress take on the character to make it intriguing.  Secondly, I just don't see anything about Jenny's character (what we've seen of it) mirrored in how River Song acts.  Third, I have to side with everyone who says that River Song hardly interacts with the Doctor like she's any sort of his offspring.

Fourth, ""The Doctor's Daughter"" was written by Stephen Greenhorn.  2 episodes later was the 2-parter ""Silence in the Library"" and ""Forest of the Dead"", written by Steven Moffat. I hardly think Moffat jumped on Greenhorn's story and wrote a character based on another writer's character.  Certainly not that quickly, and not without seeing how well the whole thing went over (after all, if the audiences hated Jenny, or even just the idea of what she represented, then Moffat would be in a hole...and so would then-showrunner RTD).  Of course, Moffat could have possibly changed his endgame for River Song since his initial concept, but then again why would he?  He seems to have had plans for her all along, and I think whatever those plans were at the start are probably still in effect.  After all, Moffat's written every story River Song appears in (including her next two appearances, the two-parter that opens the Sixth Season).

Think more about how River Song's last appearance (""The Big Bang"", the Season 5 finale) wrapped up, and see if you still think River Song is Jenny.  Here's a transcript of that:

&gt;RS: Did you dance? Well, you always dance at weddings, don't you?

&gt;Dr: You tell me.

&gt;RS: Spoilers!

&gt;Dr: (hands her back her diary and vortex manipulator) Brought it all back, but I didn't peek.

&gt;RS: Thank you.

&gt;Dr: Are you married, River?

&gt;RS: Are you asking?

&gt;Dr: Yes.

&gt;RS: Yes.

&gt;Dr: No, hang on. Did you think I was asking you to marry me, or-or-or-or asking if you were married?

&gt;RS: Yes.

&gt;Dr: No, but was that yes, or Yes?

&gt;RS: (emphasizing it) YES!

&gt;Dr: River, who ARE you?

&gt;RS: You're going to find out very soon now. And I'm sorry, but that's when everything changes. (activates vortex manipulator, and disappears)


Note that when she says ""sorry"" to him, she sounds a bit like Tennant.  And when she whispered The Doctor's name to him in her original appearance, she said ""I'm so very sorry"" to him, also rather Tennant-like.  And in Big Bang, when she dealt with the Dalek, she told him (the Dalek) that she was River Song, and had the Dalek search for her name in his files; he was then begging for mercy: he was scared of her! It's MORE likely that River Song turns out to be a future regeneration of The Doctor, rather than being the Doctor's daughter!

&gt; CTP insurance is required for every registered vehicle in Australia. It protects you from claims if you have an accident that injures another person. It does not cover you for damage to other property or damage to your own vehicle - nor does it cover you if it is you who is injured in an at-fault accident. 

&gt; In most states and territories there is only one approved provider of CTP insurance, however NSW and QLD offer vehicle owners a choice of insurer. Premiums are dependent upon the type of vehicle and who will be driving it.

&gt;The reasons for this are not entirely certain. Traditional arguments tend to favor socio-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol and drugs than females in most societies, and are more likely to die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as car accidents) or intentional (suicide, violence, war). Men are also more likely to die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include: cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, and coronary heart disease. These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer etc.

However, each of these individual risk factors can (and are) taken into account when calculating premiums without recourse to a gender shorthand. Something which individual life choices cannot influence

One aspect of age which potentially differentiates it from the group characteristics class of factors that I proposed is that age, or more precisely ageing, is something which every human regardless of circumstance experiences. 

However, you are right that it clearly does not sit well in the other individual choice risk class of factors either.

The way I have resolved this in my own mind so far is by reformulating age as experience. This I feel not only better reflects the reality of the risk posed (A 22 year old with 4 years continuous driving experience I would imagine is far less likely to be involved in an accident than a 50 year old who has just passed their test) but also brings it within the realms of individual choice risks. 

Based on this reasoning I think actuaries should (despite the practical difficulties) use experience to calculate premiums rather than age which seems to me to be essentially a short hand anyway.

The question I want answered is; is their politics better for it? Is it engaging the people better to the point where their voter turnout is increasing rather then declining as it (generally) is in this country?

But the thing that *really* bugs me about the coalition is what happened immediately after the election. The Torries and the Lib Dems locked themselves away from the public and horse-traded the policies we'd voted for in exchange for ministerial cars. How is *that* an improvement in the democratic process?

I'd understand if the party made concessions but stayed true to its principals, its promises to the voters, but then the Lib Dems (arguably the most idealistic of all the parties) showed that even promises carefully worded to be irrespective of an election result, promises signed publicly by each MP, can be traded away for power if the political situation demands it. How is that an improvement of what we have right now?

true,Elanthius,english,London,"Well its popular to complain about the ""horse trading"" but it happens anyway under the old system. For a start no party has ever implemented their entire pre-election platform. Some things are kept and some things are ditched and there's no negotiation or ""democracy"" there either its just Tony Blair or whoever doing whatever the fuck he wants to. 

Secondly I distinctly recall from the digital economy bill they passed just before the election that the Tories and Labour had obviously pre-decided that it would pass regardless of what anyone thought and they brought out a three line whip (or whatever the fuck its called) and every MP was forced to vote on it as per the Government's instructions or face dire consequences.

Lastly, at least during the ""horse trading"" there's two sides arguing about what's best and coming to compromises. The all powerful Labour government of most of the last decade rammed through a ton of crap that the people absolutely did not want but there was nothing anyone could do to stop them. A million people marched against the Iraq War for example and that's just the most blatant one. There were plenty more authoritarian attacks on liberty that the ""democratic process"" supposedly didn't want that were still pushed through.

Personally I think the ""horse trading"" is an improvement over the current system. Suddenly there are two or more sides with conflicting opinions all with a proper slice of legitimacy and they have to come to a compromise. Everyone gets a little of something that they want although they do have to decide what they want the most and what they are prepared to give up on. It's no shame that the LibDems had to back down on some of their promises. They are the junior partner in a government coalition. If they wanted to run riot doing whatever crazy things they can dream up they should have won a full majority. They didn't and the effect is that both Con and Lib have tempered their extremes.

Also, I don't agree at all that the LibDems traded their principles for power. If they had stood by their principles and given up on power then absolutely nothing that they cared about would have been implemented and for all we know the Tories would be chopping down all the trees in the country and using the wood to build bonfires out of poor people by now. They abandoned (for now!) some things they care about in exchange for the ability to implement some other things they care about. That's a worthy exchange in my opinion. If they hadn't taken this opportunity there would have been another 100 years with no LibDems in power and who knows where the fuck we'd be by then.",0,1299017504,null,0,true,0,c1iw6ph,t3_fuj7p,t1_c1iw6ph,t1_c1iw2xs,1426953732,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The British monarchy in it's current state is hugely unconventional monarchism. It's a title without substance, by convention she gives Royal Assent to everything. When you say monarchist I thought you supported a restoration of a traditional monarchy, where all power lies with one person. Which is just awful. If by monarchist you mean you support what Britain currently has, I have no quarrels; it just seems a rather obscure way to say it.

Still, democracy over monarchy any day.

&gt;They bring in tourist money, and provide a highly respected diplomatic service for Britain to the world (unlike David Cameron and his gun runners).

I read somewhere [citation needed] that they bring in more money than they spend. I don't mind having a royal family around. I don't agree with their past or having a hereditary form of government, but currently they are just a very elaborate tourist attraction. I agree about the respected diplomatic service too. All in all I support them while they have no power and cost very little.

For example,

&gt;Recently, the immigration minister admitted 139 suspected war criminals have been given the right to settle in Britain permanently. They are thought to include former henchmen of Saddam Hussein, an Afghan official who tortured prisoners, and Rwandan genocide perpetrators 

Another example of the political bias of British justice is the contrast between the treatment of Assange and that afforded to Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Who was held in Britain on October 17, 1998 under an international arrest warrant issued by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón. Unlike Assange, who has committed no crime and has not even been officially charged with one, Pinochet spent his time in the UK in luxury while being feted by leading politicians such as ex-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. His defence team included Clare Montgomery, the lawyer for the Crown who argued for Assange’s extradition.

Manchester is my number one option as well right now, due to its prestige and its airport! Otherwise, the other programmes interest me more.
&gt; choose an MA course that will lead to an area you are prepared to spend 3+ years studying (i.e. the course content is more of a priority than the University itself)

Since I am after scholarships and I aim at becoming a professor, it means that I need ""obvious"" (prestige-wise) qualifications on my CV because this is how things work -in Greece at least. The course content is satisfying in almost all the MAs that I have been offered a place at, and that is why I am wondering about the Universities themselves.
&gt; ask to speak to an Academic in the school you're considering for your MA about the route to a PhD - if you want to apply for funding, it will help you to let them know from Day 1

and

&gt; find out whether they have a postgraduate mentoring scheme or other support programmes for making the transition to a PhD

I'll do my PhD in Greece, so I know that if I get a first-class honours MA, I will be entitled for scholarships; that is certain.

Thank you SO much and I am SO sorry I took up your time so that you would advise an immature and troubled stranger!

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Unlike Pinochet, Assange made no claim he was unfit to stand trial

The Home Secretary at the time, Jack Straw, refused to allow anyone to see the medical report, making any effective legal challenge a near impossibility. Juan Garces, the Spanish lawyer who represented the families of the disappeared, said, ""The medical examinations are closed to us.... We are blind on this point."" 

&gt;Assange does spend his time on bail living in luxury, certainly compared to how I live my life.

The comparison is not being made to your life. Assange has not been charged and in fact the allegations of sexual assault in Sweden were drooped within 24 hours by Swedish chief prosecutor Eva Finne, who declared the accusations to be groundless, so why is he under house arrest at all? On the other hand Pinochet was charged genocide, terrorism, torture and forced disappearance of people and visited by former Prime Ministers for tea.

&gt;Assange didn't claim imunity as a head of state

And Pinochets claim for immunity as a *former* head of state was rejected.

&gt;Unlike Pinochet, Assange didn't claim immunity because the UK hadn't implemented the law he is suspected of breaking (i.e. the rape/sexual assault was already a law in the UK when he slept with the girls)

So genocide, terrorism, torture and forced disappearance of people are not covered under UK law?

I note that you rather conveniently fail to comment on the 139 suspected war criminals that UK authorities have permitted residence and are under no threat of extradition. 

 &gt;What I'm saying is that this particular article is crap - i.e. it's arguments are rubbish

The quality of journalism is another discussion, I find all the right wing mainstream media piss poor , but always find it interesting when the bourgeoisie media start criticizing the bourgeoisie and in regards to you peddling the old criticism of 'agenda pushing', that is the case for every publication in the UK, to think otherwise is naive.

&gt;I'm not saying ...that the legal system isn't biased.

But that is exactly what you are saying,...'it's arguments are rubbish'...I think you quite clearly think the legal system isn't biased. You completely ignore the fact that suspected war criminals are allowed to stay in the UK and that a mass murderer was let go with the support of leading British politicians under the pretext of a *secret* medical report but see nothing controversial about extraditing a man for *allegations* that were dropped within 24 hours on the basis of being groundless...and you somehow come to the conclusion this is 'hardly controversial' or that you are '*not* saying...that the legal system isn't biased'.",0,1299054456,null,0,true,0,c1iysc6,t3_funkf,t1_c1iysc6,t1_c1ixpxu,1426955024,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Under the new system, they will start to pay back the loan at a higher wage than they do now,

This is exactly my complaint!

IMHO, if you are earning less than 21k a year, your job is not graduate level.

Under the new system, you pay back 9% of everything your earn over 21k.  So if you graduate and get a job you never needed a degree for, if you wasted your time and SLCs money at uni, then the that is fine, the government will eventually pay your loan off when you hit 50 or whenever.

If you get a graduate entry level job and start earning above 21k, then you pay 11% NI, 23% marginal tax and now 9% student loans.  That’s 43% gone before you get to pay for rent, food and transport.

Savings are never going to happen (unless you can grow your own food and walk to work in home made shoes).

So you cant buy a house, you can live to work to hope that one day you will be given enough raises to finally be paying back faster than the interest that you are getting charged is being added (which at 24k, the average grad starting salary in the UK, you are no where near).

Meanwhile people with enough cash to never have taken a loan go straight to buying their first house.

Then after 5 years, when you are just getting to the point where you are decreasing the principle, they buy their second.  You still cant afford the deposit though, so you rent theirs for more than the cost of their mortgage.

Means while the guy who did basket weaving and is happy stacking tins in Tesco 16 hours a week and drinking Tesco’s own lager is on housing benefit.

Under the new system people who fuck about are fine, people who are rich get richer and people who come from nothing and want to climb out pay through the nose.

The effect of all this is a regressive tax on people who earn middle incomes and whose earning rise more slowly than others.

Edit:  Sorry this is long, we probably wont agree since this is ground we have both covered many times but really, the new system is the worst possible for people who are poor and work hard.

Too high and they wouldn't get the students (and hence money), too low and the better students will look elsewhere (naturally this is an oversimplification but for an individual course it essentially holds).

Now there are in the position where they have to optimise two variables - entry requirements and course fees. Naturally, if all Russell Group and 1994 Group universities set the fees at £9k then we have the situation that you're positing will happen.

However, if a university sets its fees at, say, £7500/year, it will be a better proposition for students who like the idea of being £4.5k/£6k less in debt by the end of their degree. As a result it can take the pick of these students, increasing its entry requirements and hence demand better students. Obviously Oxbridge/Imperial will always be able to set the fees at £9k and demand the best, but it's not currently clear whether all universities will be able to do this. As soon as one university sets their fees even marginally below £9k they are putting themselves at an academic advantage.

Naturally some courses require large funds for equipment but there are other high-earning subjects which do not (maths or law, for example). If a university can offer these at a lower price without impacting the quality of teaching then they will be able to attract better students. All this remains to be seen however, I'm just saying I wouldn't automatically assume that &lt;£9k fees =&gt; lower quality product/output.

Dear Prime Minister Cameron,
Dear Deputy Prime Minister Clegg,
Dear Ministers,

What gain to democracy can there be in one man owning nearly half our countries mass media; and having the power to control 'the conversation' and thoughts of so many. 

The fact Rupert Murdoch can meet with you personally, and (at least claims to) hold great sway in the outcome of elections; where as citizens such as myself, are forced to send off these most likely un-read emails shows the power the man currently has. Giving him ownership of BSkyB would further trample our rules on media ownership and continue the decline of political discourse in this country.

Giving Murdoch more control, more power and more influence in the UK media market; is not best for UK citizens; is not best for media competition and is not best for democracy. I can already hear what Murdoch has to say in several existing ways; do not give him yet another mouthpiece diluting public discussion.

In entertainment programs, being an authentic character is sometimes more important than being understood (cf. The Wire). But Professor Cox is presenting educational/scientific content. In this kind of documentary programming, the reverse is true: Good enunciation and elocution are much more important than the personality of the presenter. Part of the reason why e.g. Sir David Attenborough is so respected is because he is such an excellent speaker. Yes, Attenborough is not a science professor like Cox, but as long as the script is up to scratch, I'd rather listen to a layman speaker with great delivery instead of listening to a scientist with not so great delivery. Granted, there are exceptions. Case in point: Professor Stephen Hawking. But in Hawking's case there is a compelling personal story that engages and draws in the audience on an emotional level that is very rare. And so it should be, because generally speaking there's too much emphasis on star qualities and biopics and celebrity culture, and often not as much real hard science.

All of this is not to belittle Cox or his achievements, really. Even my former ""hating"" was more in a HHOS-HHOK sense.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You are assuming that 17 and 18 year olds will make logical choices about a difference of 1/6th in their final debt compared to the possible difference in earnings.

I think that they will act out of fear and the knowledge that they dont have to pay that extra for many decades (since repayments are fixed irrelevant of debt size, higher fees mean paying longer, not more per month...).

The argument over whether humans are logical operators in economic systems is a much bigger one than I think I can comment on.

&gt;As soon as one university sets their fees even marginally below £9k they are putting themselves at an academic advantage.

Here you assume that the advantage of picking up brighter, more cost aware students outweighs the disadvantage of getting 1.5k a year less per head for a given course.

Assuming that you can only charge one rate (and not say 1.5k less for people with good academics or people who list them as the first UCAS choice) this really comes down to how much more valuable those students are compared to your average AND to how many more student you will attract.

So if those students are much brighter than your average AND they are very willing to consider your uni over somewhere else (remember this is a catch 22 because very bright students are comparing you to OxBridge) you will get a high return.

BUT if those brighter students only really effect the quality of your course a little AND if 90% of students just opt to pay whatever and go to as good a place as possible then you will stand to lose badly because by cutting Everyone’s fees you lose a lot of money to attract a few brighter students who add little value to the course.

Looking at the effects of the maths here, I think you will need students to be very willing to ""trade down""  AND to add a lot of ""value"" to your courses in order for it to work.  If only one of these is true then the final value added will be a lot less than the value added by the now lost fees income.

As such a VC would have to be very confident to pursue an undercutting strategy compared to a max fees, added quality strategy.

Sorry for quoting you back to yourself and for this being so long.  I guess what Im saying is that is *might* be worth cutting fees to get better students but only if those students somehow add a lot of value AND you can either attract a lot of them or somehow attract them without cutting fees for all the students you were going to get anyway.  I think its called market diversification or something...

Whatever you views are, it would appear that the idea the comprehensive school was supposed to create, a grammar school class education for all, has not worked. So I would look at re-introducing a modernized grammar school system which put academically talented kids in a separate school system while not repeating the mistakes of the previous tripartite system where those who are less able were given the bare minimum required to work in a factory. Done correctly, this would ensure that no matter your background, if you have talent it is nurtured. Combine this with polytechnics, where students whose talents lie in more technical subjects can continue to get education after 18, but in a less academically orientated system, and we would have something similar to the German system. 

The current system tries to treat everyone as equal, and as such tends to ignore the fact that some peoples talents are academic and others are in more technical areas. And this is not working for us.

We also need to encourage more people to take the risk of creating their own firms, not entirely sure how we would do this but we need to work towards an environment where the next Google or the next Huawei could start in Chelmsford or Bradford, rather than just vainly hoping that some multinational will take pity on us and build a factory in the UK.

For me, it should be all or nothing:  Either education is a right and free for anyone able to pass the entrance exam OR everyone pays.  Why we should subsidise people doing ""unprofitable"" degrees by taxing only those who do profitable ones is beyond me, in fact its worse than the free market because it actively punishes people for being profitable...

However I do believe in the market place and I would like to see the government ensure that there is sufficient competition so that consumers can vote with their cash .

Housing - Official Uni Halls accommodation is ridiculously expensive. It's very nice and you're guaranteed to meet people but yea it's extortionate.

I lived in Pollock myself back in the day and it was a lot of fun but if you're on a budget it's not the best option. Gumtree (Kind of our equivalent of Craigslist) is good to private ads, the Uni accommodation service has a few good flats which are cheaper. At the moment a fair price for rent in a private, centrally located flat hovers around £350 a month. You can spend A LOT more very easily but you can get good accommodation for less as well, luck of the draw.

Ocean you say? Plenty of spectacular beaches and water sports nearby. Uni has a surfing society, lots of independent ones as well. 

Performing Arts? Edinburgh has a plethora of theatres and, although not as many as London, it gets many of the big shows as well as plenty of smaller companies. Plenty of opportunities to get involved with student productions as well.

There already are networks of communities of people who help one-another; creating forced contractual requirements to help for free is not creating anything close to a society on that level, it is creating administrative functions to enforce working for nothing. A true society I would imagine would not need coercion via contractual terms for money or benefits.

On that note however, I do think the Jobcentre needs a lot of changing. If an individual wishes to volunteer to work, they should be allowed. It seems pathetic that if you volunteer for over 16 hours a week they can stop your benefits because you are considered to be not looking for permanent employment.

In contrast to my earlier point, why could we not perhaps give an individual benefits if they want to do charity work for 16 hours or more as an option rather than a requirement? The elderly who enjoy voluntary work could benefit financially, youths who don't want to work could get involved in their community for money and people who can't find work could take it as an alternative to JSA.

Reputation is such an important commodity to universities.  Only real difference between graduates of the same disipline, in terms of employabilty, is the universities reputation.  And the damage done to a universities reputation by charging less, can't possibly be balanced by a few extra students who come for the cheaper fees.  Additionally, charging lower fees is going to discourage the best students from applying, hurting the uni's standing even further.

In the UK the old polytechnics have been trying to bring themselves up towards the level of other universities for the past few decades now, why would any of them CHOOSE to go back?

**An online television station?** Not cheap. Not one word in the proposal for an online, fresh-air style television station is a synonym for cheap.

**Gigs chosen by students?** Give me a break. Booking the freshers acts is a bloody expensive affair and realistically, EUSA shouldn't be paying an extra £5k to book a massive band so students don't have to pay for gigs themselves. Every President that's got in has mentioned this somewhere, and then realised how unfeasible it is. They could, for a much smaller price, invest more in the untapped talent society, and see Edinburgh Uni bands promoted more within the uni.

**Free recording studio, dark rook, table tennis.** Just say table tennis. It's the only one that's even remotely possibly going to happen. You can't even pretend that EUSA is going to organise a free recording studio. Unless it's unstaffed you're looking at everything getting stolen or broken. If it's volunteer staffed, you're looking at a difficult, equally expensive system where we need volunteers who are experienced sound engineers with massive patience for entitled kids. If it's staffed, hello paying someone's part-time wages. Same with the dark room. Pretending this is viable is flat out lying.

**Power our unions with renewable energy.** Honestly. 

**Housing co-ops.** Have you ever tried organising even four flatmates to pay bills on time. Don't take the piss.

**Free transport to KB.** In your mind, when every single person bases a campaign on this, and then invariably fails to do it, did they just change their mind? Or did they, upon seeing the bill for a dedicated bus service, immediately realise it's fucking expensive. The bike rental scheme was a better idea, but to the best of my knowledge that didn't pan out either.

**A student letting service.** Because that won't be massively expensive and difficult to co-ordinate and achieve. Given the massive cuts eduction faces right now, the last thing Edinburgh Uni or EUSA wants to get into is competing with real, existing letting firms that are out to make a profit at whatever cost.

**An end of year festival on the meadows.** People have previously tried to organise this. The cost was estimated at a good few thousand pounds, especially due to insurance and policing.

**But:**

An online television station is a society in its own right, like fresh air. If he really wanted to set this up, he'd just set up that society.

For 'gigs chosen by students' i assume we're talking about freshers week, because eusa doesn't really do any other gigs. What students are choosing the gigs? The new freshers? They're hardly going to be big on the edinburgh band knowledge. Freshers want pendulum and example and vampire weekend. If we were talking about putting on actual gigs with local bands, the only people doing that are, again, the untapped talent society, and the odd other society crossover. I'm all for giving them money to do that.

The student letting service could work, the way you're explaining it, but it does really just sound like a noticeboard with flat listings?

Well, perhaps that's what he intends to do.  And why not.

No, he isn't just talking about freshers week.  EUSA actually does put on a fair few gigs during the semester.  The untapped talent soc. may be doing just fine, but I have never seen one of their gigs advertised.  I fear you might be missing the point on this one.  Gigs, chosen by students (a committee of students, with a real interest in music), to be put on in EUSA venues throughout the year.  What's not to applaud about that?

Dodgy letting agencies wouldn't be allowed to advertise there.  It'll be the only place you'd need to look, and a place you could trust.

He has, yes.  I don't see why that makes him careerist; it's clearly something he feels passionate about.  You'll have to take me on my word - he's no interest in sexing up his CV, nor in remuneration.  Trust me, have a chat with him and you'll see what I'm saying.  He wants to be president of EUSA because he wants to make the University better, and he thinks he can.",0,1299114347,null,0,false,0,c1j2nm8,t3_fw1cb,t1_c1j2nm8,t1_c1j2lvp,1426956846,0,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,0

Cant quite remember now but Rafa said something along the lines of he couldn't hack it mentally over here in England (we dont know why) and that was the reason why, during the end of last season when Aquilani was fit, Rafa didn't give him consistent starts even though we needed creativity in the middle to 'save' our season.

He did shine against Portsmouth and some other lower teams, but lets face it, those teams made anyone with some flair in the middle look good. I just think he wanted to go back home, and when Hodgson came in he saw an injury prone player (mind, when he came in we were supposedly in a 'rebuilding' stage and had to clear out deadwood and players on big wages) who wasn't fit for England. 

Think the basis of the loan was that we send him out, if he has a good season and gets match fitness we get him back fit without risking him in the Premier League this season OR he gets bought for a fee that we can use to reinvest, or if he has another bad season we're not having to pay his huge wages and again find that out the hard way ourselves. The decision was as much Purslows as it was Hodgsons I think.

Mind, Meireles was Aquilani's replacement (and lets face it, that worked out quite well). Which means we still haven't filled the gap Alonso left (or Mascherano for that matter, as we've all seen Poulsen play).

true,crazylilting,welsh,Wales,"debt is scary no doubt.  But it is a new thing here in the UK for students to have debt.  Many other nations already have this and they seem to cope just fine.  Yes it would be nice to have no debt, and yes it would be nice to have free education.  But from my perspective I would be subsidizing your income by paying for your education.  

Look at the average income and their tax burden which goes to pay for people who will make 4 or even 5 times what i make, how is that fair?  I think people are just so used to getting a free ride here that they see it as their right.  

I think it is sad that your friends are in families that put their children down and limit their futures but that is also a fact of life, a good friend would help them see their own worth and help over come the damage that their parents have done.  Short of that there is no real answer.  We can't put nanny cam's in people's houses to prevent them from abusing their children...

Also if you think apprenticeships are easy to get you are mistaken as well.  As a joiner who is looking for an apprentice I can assure you that I wouldn't choose just anyone.  I won't hire anyone who doesn't have a good grasp on maths, trigonometry, has a patient temperament, and has an aptitude for woodworking.  The other thing with apprenticeships is that many people just use this as a means to pay next to nothing to have a body around the shop.  They do not teach them much and the colleges are no better at training people to be trades people.

&gt;Protest doesn't seem to do much more than be cast as irresponsible loonyism by minority groups

**BloodRedSumo:** 
&gt;I want riots. I want them violent and loud

Zygotic hits the nail on the head: history does indicate that violent and loud protests are counter-productive unless a threshold in size is reached. 

Ten people being violent and loud are thugs. Five hundred people being violent and loud are hooligans. Ten thousand people being violent and loud are rioters. All of these can easily be dismissed by any government and all of the media. But a million people being loud are protestors with a legitimate voice. 

There are lots of things to protest about, but the reality is these issues only incredibly rarely bring a million angry people to the streets. 

If you look at the UKUncut protests against Vodafone they get media attention for peacefully disrupting high-streets, shop fronts and the like with a tiny number of people. Whether they directly achieve anything is another matter, but the point is clear; you can make yourself heard without breaking things.

I think 2500 people can easily make the top of the headlines without so much as chipping a teacup. 

If 50 groups each with 50 people made their way to the middle of the 50 busiest road junctions in rush-hour in London and all sat down and refused to budge, you can bet your arse there would be very little else on the news for a couple of days as the city grinds to a total halt and police are unable to deal with such a large number of constantly changing sit-down protests. 

Whether this exact tactic is a good one or not I hope I’ve made the point that more often than not, expressing anger angrily devalues your own argument, whereas expressing anger calmly and cleverly is very hard to ignore.

Cut forward to today, where we have an Xbox 360-style rendered moon, lens flare ahoy and the textures aren't even accurate while someone manages to give us less information than we had before.

This doesn't need to happen, we have video footage of us going to the moon (which to be fair would probably be used in both versions at some point), the JAXA probe shot the moon in full HD, including it's circumnavigation and earthrise.

Compare [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJkKf_1R4mI) to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8E_3ku17H4) - notice how leading up to a minute in, for some reason Titan is now green and instead of showing [actual landing footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUlr8fKI2bc) which was incredible to watch the first time, that's been eschewed in favour of CGI. Notice how Cox goes on about Alaska as though he's talking to a two year old or someone from /r/woahdude and then goes on to try and compare it to Titan without actually telling us an awful lot, he then goes on to tell us that water on Titan is like steel (which is untrue, on Titan water appears to behave in a similar way to how rock does on earth). I'm not having a massive pop at Cox in particular as much as science documentaries in general. To be fair to him he gets a trip to Alaska, his face on the telly and all he has to do in exchange is read from a script that he probably lacks a great deal of influence over. But if you compare it to BBC's planets I find that Wonders of the Solar System is more focused on entertainment than informing people and the reliance on CGI, and even worse inaccurate CGI makes people dumber for watching it.

The straw that broke the camels back for me was [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri9bAtQDe00&amp;feature=relmfu) utter, utter, drivel.

Your inability to draw any comparison or even to attempt to question the political pressures at work behind two men, under house arrest and awaiting extradition from the same country, one for charges that have already been declared groundless and other on charges of genocide, terrorism, torture and forced disappearance of people and being courted by leading British politicians and the very different outcomes, indicates that although John's arse may well be itchy, you have your head stuck up yours.

Manslaughter isn't just for negligence it's for recklessness and killing someone without specific intent too.  Specific intent is quite a particular thing, and I'm not sure simply pissing around in an incredibly irresponsible manner would cut it.  My knowledge is somewhat out of date, but as far as I'm aware it goes something like this...

You'd basically have to have proved, so that the jury were sure, that these guys specifically intended to kill or to have caused grievous bodily injury.  Of course, if death/serious injury were a moral certainty of their behaviour, it wouldn't have mattered a jot that they didn't desire it.  However, whilst they could've easily been convicted of gross negligent/reckless or constructive manslaughter (the latter being killing someone as a consequence of committing a crime, in this case interfering with fire equipment), I think you'd've been very hard pressed to have convinced a jury, certainly me, that they intended to kill/seriously injure people or that death was a moral certainty.

If there's a guy on a bicycle, you may click for hazard - but if you pass him and nothing happens, then that's that.  However, if a few seconds later the guy on the bicycle suddenly veers out, you click again.  The original hazard has developed - the test is measuring the gap between your first and second clicks, i.e. spotting the original hazard, and spotting when it develops into something that requires you to take action.

I believe it still scores you out of 5 for this, though I can't remember the exact method.  I believe it's correlated to the time taken between the 2 clicks - so if it takes you 2 seconds to notice the hazard, then 2 seconds to notice when the hazard develops, you lose 4 seconds.  The 5 point scale rewards that accordingly - perhaps anything under 1 second for each will give you a 5.

No, it's the way it's been for ages (since the abolition of grand juries in 1933). [From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrates%27_Court):

&gt;Magistrates' courts deal with minor offences (generally, fines of up to £5,000 and imprisonment of up to 6 months). However, when dealing with two or more offences, a magistrates' court has the power to impose a sentence of up to a year if at least two of the offences are triable either way. For certain specified offences, maximum fines may be higher (for example, for fly tipping up to £50,000). Magistrates sitting in a Youth Court have the power to impose a sentence of youth detention (known as a Detention and Training Order or DTO) for a period of up to two years.

&gt;They are often considered to be the workhorses of the criminal justice system in England &amp; Wales and handle over 95 percent of the criminal cases in that jurisdiction. When an either way offence is to be tried at the Crown Court, magistrates are responsible for committal to the Crown Court (a task in former times dealt with by a grand jury), which requires the Court to consider whether there is a case to answer based upon statements and exhibits submitted to the court.

Minor offences can only be dealt with by magistrates, with an 'either way' offence the magistrates decide whether a Crown Court trial is required (although the defendant may waive this right), with serious offences the court must indite the defendant for a Crown Court trial.

[When appealing the outcome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenges_to_decisions_of_magistrates%27_courts) the defendant may escalate to the Crown Court, or possibly the High Court, but will never receive a jury trial.",0,1299189703,null,0,false,0,c1j7g6j,t3_fwfqi,t1_c1j7g6j,t1_c1j7byi,1428205805,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ah, indeed although a Magistrates Court decides whether it is itself able to commence with a summary trial or consider a committal to Crown Court, the defendant has a 'right of election to a Crown Court'

e.g.

&gt; Defence ""right of election"" to the Crown Court after not guilty plea

&gt; 22. Where the magistrates consider the offence is suitable for summary trial, the defendant is told of this, and warned that, even after a summary trial, the magistrates may nevertheless send the defendant to the Crown Court for sentence where they feel the offence merits greater punishment than they have the power to impose. The defendant will then be asked: ""Do you wish to be tried by this court or do you wish to be tried by a jury?""

&gt; 23. A defendant therefore has to agree to a summary trial if this is the course of action to be followed, but has the right to ""elect"" or choose jury trial. In simple terms this means that the defendant still has the choice to elect a Crown Court trial even if the magistrates' court decides that a case is suitable for summary trial.

http://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/enforcementguide/court/magistrates-mode.htm

So it would seem we still have the right to trial by jury for minor criminal offences.

It is not an attempt to use the Middle Classes, to ‘pull up’ rather than an attempt to provide fair opportunities to all (pull up what btw, academic achievement? Ofsted reports?) And even if the lower classes should be held responsible for their heinous crime of being lower classes, their children should not be, I would think we are a bit beyond the whole ‘sins of the father’ thing

That is of course, going off on a tangent from the point though, whatever happens, a large number of parents will be disappointed. All the article said was that some children aren’t getting into their top six schools.

You are right; inequality is getting worse (in some ways), what would your solution be if not mixing up pupils to give pupils in the lower classes access to proven teachers?  Grammar Schools? Were the brightest get the best education, because if those are run properly, there will be the lower class ‘shite’ in them too because many are quite bright. Everyone going to their first choice schools? Resulting in the old poor schools being closed down because no one goes there, which would just make a different school the poor school in the area, and/or make all the others suffer because of high class sizes.

true,scrunchcrunch,null,null,"This is an example of a pun based on an idiomatic (phrasal) verb. In this case ""go off"". 

An idiomatic verb consists of a verb and a preposition. The meaning of an idiomatic verb has nothing to do with the meaning of the individual words that make up the idiomatic verb. For example ""get over"". The meaning of ""get"" and ""over"" have no bearing on the idiomatic meaning of ""get over"" (recover from an emotional set back).

Go off like a frog in a sock means that a frog in a sock would die, and very quickly go off (go rotten) in a major way. Then, by the beautiful power of puns and idiomatic verbs, this idea is extended to mean that if anyone was going off in a serious way (ie having a lot of fun in a boisterous manner) they were going off like a frog in a sock. It is a pun on the different meanings of ""go off"".
 
Another example of this is ""Flat out like a lizard drinking"". When lizards drink, they lie down very flat. So, again by the power of puns and idioms, this now means ""flat out"" in the sense of very busy. A person who is flat out like a lizard drinking is very very busy. 

These are both common Australian idioms that brits have picked up, not always getting the right end of the stick.

The real skill in creating these types of idiomatic puns, is picking idioms that have multiple but contradictory meanings. Someone having fun could not really be compared to a frog rotting in the sun in an old sock, or could they.... Someone very very busy could not be compared to a lizard lying around in the sun having a leisurely drink, or could they....

true,[deleted],null,null,"On the face of it the solutions proposed (Lower grades for university entrance for kids from poorer backgrounds etc) are perfectly rational decisions which can't be individually argued against. Each of these issues and solutions are synonymous to concentrating on the trees and not seeing the wood.

Society has in many ways vastly improved over the decades and centuries. The most fundamental change is the reduction of child mortality. [This has a direct impact on fertility rates](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_on_global_population_growth.html). The west has sub 10% child mortality which has reduced fertility rates and stabilised population growth.

But there is a distortion: The well meaning, perfectly rational decision to help those less fortunate, particularly solo mothers, by providing benefits and increasing those benefits for each child born. I am not arguing against this policy, it makes perfect sense but it has allowed those less well off to be able to increase their family size without the direct impact of the reduction of resources per child as those without access to these benefits would experience. This has then lead to an uneven population growth where the most children are born to those less able to financially support them.

The social policies introduced by successive governments have all been to try to improve the lot of those born into this uneven playing field mainly by squeezing the middle classes with taxes and throwing benefit after benefit to the lower classes (I am completely biased here being middle class myself but this is what it looks like from my perspective).

I cannot provide a simply worded, concise solution to this problem because it is not simple but I'll try anyway:

A nice idea I have heard about is to provide every citizen of a country a minimum income. This is given to every person at a flat rate from the poorest to the richest that is tax free and that it can be used for whatever purpose they wish with no minimum age of recipient. When a child is born they automatically receive this but is placed into a trust fund until they are an adult.

There is no shame in receiving this income as everyone receives it, it allows the poorest to be able to survive and allow them to add to their income without detriment by working in whatever capacity they can. Everyone will start their adult life with a nest egg that can help them get a leg up if they use it sensibly.   Any addition of dependants has a direct impact on the spread of their resources so the incentive is to have as few children as possible. When combined with free health care, education and contraceptives and a little fairy dust all the unevenness will magically disappear in a cloud of smoke.

No politician will even consider this as it is too long term and making the changes to implement it would be very disruptive. Not to mention that this is yet more social engineering which I rallied against near the beginning of this thread.

Trying to spread out the clever, well brought up kids to try and pull up the less fortunate without considering the root of the problem is going to fracture society even more.

That is a fair debate, and the balance is a delicate one that people have always and will always struggle with.

However, education is different. Education you only get one real shot at, and has the ability to determine the rest of your life. And because that shot is when you are a child, you don't have the control of your situation, that means you can be blamed for it.

I would also point out, that sometimes (in fact often) spoilt middle class children, are worse to teach than deprived lower class children. Any child, no matter their class or upringing, if their actions are seen to be significantly damaging the education of their peers (all children do to some degree at times) should be dealt with anyway.

In short, give all children a chance, but deal with all children if they are ruining that chance for others.

This is true, but there's a crippling problem with it - it only holds true if *every area cared for homeless people equally*.

If you decentralise decision-making, then some areas will spend more money and provide better facilities for homeless people than others.

Given the various regions of London are geographically close, it's pretty obvious that you'll then see homeless people drifting towards the areas where they receive good care, and away from the ones where they get little or no support.

This will further stress the areas already providing good support, and the areas which provide little will cut their homeless-services budgets as an unnecessary expense.

Good caregiving services then end up looking under-funded and giving poor service, and poorly-funded ones end up looking over-funded and unnecessary.

At this stage all the *good* regions can do is cut funding (to cut the attraction to homeless people from other areas) and give worse service, or the other areas can start funding better services (competing to have more homeless people in your area - yeah, I can see councils going for *that* option &lt;:-).

Net result: worse services for homeless people, as the only areas who give a shit about them become inundated, and either have to cut back on their services or limp along as best they can, while other areas cut back on their ""unnecessary"" support services, shift the problem onto neighbouring areas and get praised for doing so.

Looked at it this way, this is actually an argument for *centralised* control - at least that way you can try to ensure that comparable (and acceptable) services are provided in all areas, and keep service-users spread out where they can be tackled manageably, and by the local authority who *should* be caring for them.",0,1299243484,null,0,true,0,c1jai80,t3_fx794,t1_c1jai80,t1_c1jafkn,1426960555,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

You people pay high taxes. I mean...it's pervasive in your life. A pretty big deal. And with all of the tax you pay, this new government can't make everything that needs to happen, happen?

Ah, so they'll *cut* taxes, maybe? Spur some growth? Cut some spending as well?

If it were our personal finances, it's like posing the question of ""Well, should we earn more money or start cutting things from our budget?"" And someone then asks ""well, have you thought of being frugal, not overspending wildly, looking for deals and values, etc?"" and it's like someone just told you something shockingly outrageous.

It's such an easy problem to fix. In the US, we'll need a collapse of the country to get rid of the military-industrial complex draining us. For you, all you need is some smarter politicians.

When I lived in Vancouver, the Liberals came to power, closed down the mental hospital and all of the mentally ill were simply released. And became homeless. Started committing crimes.

true,BonzoTheBoss,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"It's articles like this that make me wonder what David Cameron or any of the other politicians actually think. Seriously, what is their world outlook? What do they think during the average day? It's obviously going to be different from the ""common man"", but by how much? I'm just curious as to the thought processes required to arrive at such blatantly bad ideas. At what point do they sit around a table, look at some new legislation and think ""Yes, that's a jolly good idea!"" and then wonder why people hate them for it.

There's also the probability that (making wide generalisations here) most politicians probably had everything handed to them growing up (especially tories) so they can't associate with the problems and concerns of the common person. I won't go as far as saying they're incapable of empathising, but articles like this support it. I appreciate migigating cirumstances, they can't always make popular decisions, sometimes the good of the country as a whole must come before the individual but I don't know (not without becoming prime minister I suppose) how these decisions are made. For example, I understand cuts in public spending need to be made, but the way they've gone about it just feels wholly wrong. Having said that, I cannot provide an adequate answer for how they SHOULD do it either...

Another problem I forsee is the public becoming alienated with politicians (even more than they are now) to the point where change is made impossible. By this I mean, let's say that I become a politician, I'm a pretty average guy, came from a poor household and (might) understand what people want from their government. When I go on my election campaign the people may have become so disillusioned by years of contradictory, apparently unsupportive and outright lying governments that they won't believe my promises, and just accept the shit they're given as the norm, stagnating change. The point being that we might genuinely get a ""good"" politician but no believe it. Perhaps Nick Clegg really is a good guy, but circumstance has resulted in no one ever trusting him or the Lib Dems ever again because of their ""compromises"" (substitute for ""bending over"") on policies which they promised but were unable to deliever on.

TL;DR: To what extent are politicians disassociated from the public? Do any of them truly understand what people want from them? Do they even care? Have we become so alienated that we no longer believe in politicians even if they're genuinely hard-working for our interests?

1, 2 and 3 introduced the basic personality of the Doctor and the doctor/companion relationship.  As well as the 3 general plots (secret aliens in modern times, disaster in the future, old mythical creature/monster in olden times being an alien up to no good)

Aliens in London/WWIII introduced the concept of the Doctor being known about by the government and cemented the idea that he had been meddling on earth a LONG TIME and set new users up for the existence of UNIT

Dalek introduced the Daleks and gave an informal history of their relationship with the Doctor.

Long Game covered the idea that you aren't supposed to bring tech back in time to alter the timeline and also the Doctor's feelings about humanity and how curiosity and discovery were considered important and core human traits. (Answering: If he can time travel and wants to help people why doesn't he just bring the cure for cancer back in time?)

Father's Day covered temporal paradoxes and why you can't just ""redo"" things to prevent all the disasters from happening in the first place.

Empty Child/Doctor Dances covered types of life and problems/bad guys beyond basic ""giant evil space monster"" or ""human who is a dick"".

Technically, LLU is available in rural areas. Any ISP can install their equipment in any exchange and offer LLU services (and near me, TalkTalk has done just that on exchanges with approx 2000 lines). It's just that the economics often don't stack up, so ISPs don't do it. But it is available.

Seems his main gripe is the departure of Xabi Alonso, Torres and Mascherano rather than trophy glory, as he signed a contract extension last year when he knew we'd be playing Europa League football this season. I suppose he still wants trophies but he doesn't mind waiting for them, as long as the club shows ambition to get there - the difference between him and Torres.

But since we have a release clause in his contract, we might not even have a say in him departing for United, so it's up to him - but his last quotes don't sound good.

Still, not all negative. If the owners show ambition in this transfer window I can see him staying.

Torres' form was never just about what was happening or not happening in Liverpool, you only need to look at his at his performances for country to see that. As far as ambition goes, look at what happened in the last transfer window, then you have united who have just offered carrick a new contract ffs. During the bad times we needed Torres to stand up and be counted, not sulk and bide his time for a move like he did. Look where he ended up, playing for Ancelotti who is garnering about as much support from his players as Hodgson had. The writing is on the wall for him if you ask me, then where will El Nino be? Right back where he was with us, whilst we kick on with a brighter future. What Reina has to ask himself is does he want to do the same? Does he want to join Fergie; who may have half the FA and Murdoch press on his side but sadly not father time. Does he essentially want to play for Henry or the Glazers? I know who I would rather be kicking a ball for. As Kenny said, the club has to be bigger than any one player. I'd sooner have a team without him than have deadwood hanging around who aren't committed to Kenny and putting Liverpool back where they belong. Pepe, go join a club whose hallmark of winning is cynicism, rule bending and intimidation of officials if that's where you feel like you belong. If you have class then you know there's few places better you can be. Kenny and the Kop will be King with or without you.

Anyway, I know how awful it is when you apply and get rejected meanwhile there are far less able people in the same job (I even got rejected from ASDA :/). But ultimately they want to hire the least capable, so they are trapped in to the job like mindless slaves - they basically want cheap machines, and it's cheaper to use minimum wage labour than it is to automate the work.

But it's not the immigrants' fault, they are just trying to find work just like us. It is the fault of the economic system that creates this absurd situation of simultaneous overwork and unemployment, and means we cannot use the supply of labour to relieve the work burden on all whilst sharing the products of our work. 

That said, no amount of communist theory is going to help really, so honestly I would just recommend trying to find any opportunities you can, be it working or for further experience in whatever it is you studied. Anything is better than being stuck doing nothing, both for looking good on a CV and stopping depression setting in, though I know this is far easier said than done.

I was surprised how many people seem to have the attitude that ""the world doesn't owe you a living"" etc. with no recognition that really we could all be in a similar situation. It is absurd that we have such technology and wealth and yet we still have unemployment and homelessness, etc., it would seem that it would be far more productive if we invested in automating menial work, sharing the burden of the remaining work equally and using the wealth to educate and train people to do work that is really required.

It's only for special damages. It recognises at the time it was made a women's reputation was likely to effect the course of her life significantly. And thus is you smeared her in this way and could not prove your claims then special damages could be awarded. 

But the sum of the special damages is not automatically higher than it would have been otherwise.

In the UK if you make a false claim about someone you're guilty of slander/libel. The only defence to the charge is to prove it's true.
This law doesn't remove that defence. It effects only the award after the defence fails to prove it's true.

As for the phrase 'positive discrimination', think liberally here. It places value upon a women's reputation in a world were such things had recognisable value and such this law protects that value.

As for sexist. It's not, it doesn't offer women anything men don't get. It just recognises a situation which today would still be the case.

I think you're misunderstanding what the law says and that's why you think it's about all that. It's not.

The Act makes slander of this kind actionable per se in that **no** proof of damage is needed; so it's saying that the victim need not prove that the slanderous words actually caused her any actual (special/monetary) damage.

I am not arguing that the Act entitles women to higher damages ? Only that if a man were to go to court on the same grounds he would have to prove that the slanderous words have caused him damage (i.e. prove special damage). Thus offering women automatic right to claim defamation without any resulting damage that men would have to prove. 

&gt;It places value upon a women's reputation in a world were such things had recognisable value and such this law protects that value.

Isn't a man's reputation in this regard also important ? To make this only apply to women IMHO it diminishes the woman's worth to how 'pure' her sexual history is.

All it does it pre define for the courts one type of special damages in one set of circumstances. If you check case law you will find lots of similar but unratified law you could use just the same.

In modern courts this law would merely lead to the judge awarding the special damages to the sum proved. Which could be nothing, or could be something.

This in simple terms means that a woman could take someone to court because somebody claimed they were adulterous and the courts would have to decide if it was slanderous even if no damage had occurred (damage is presumed) whereas if a man in the same circumstance  would have to prove damage.

I'd have to check old bailey for case law, but I going to say this. The burden for women was probably already proven to a standard in case law that led to it being ratified by the legislator. I doubt this just spontaneously came about. If it did I'd be surprised.

To get any actual damages one would still need to demonstrate some compelling reason for a sum. The judge doesn't just award it. 

And yes, while there is a little extra for women here, it's not just because they're women. It's because of the real circumstances of our society on or around the time this was ratified, which if you check your history was actually placing huge demands on women to remain pure/chaste, etc.

A Judge is unlikely to feel any real sympathy for anyone who attempts to use this law just for the sake of it. While it can be read as being sexist I doubt it actually ever caused a ruling to be.

Imagine reading all positive discrimination law in that light. It's racist, sexist, hetro-phobic and generally not balanced. But if you put it into context those laws are ratified and backed by a wealth of cases showing need for them

It's archaic, and it's out of custom. It has little power and it's unlikely to result in any real sexist rulings...

So far you ranted a bit about immigration and people playing the race card, but I don't really know what discussion you actually wanted to have here. I thought your post was just a rant, but you said you want discussion. Well, about what?

Not what you said on your post, unfortunately. And I'd bet that their decission was not based on skill level, but on what they'd get back as a company.

&gt;I base them on immigration because we don't need more humans that can't speak English in Britain.

Sure, I think it's reasonable to expect people to learn the local idiom of whatever place they chose to settle in.

The 'Ghost Walks' are fun, and will give you something to do in the evening - I think there are a few to choose from, but I'd highly recommend going on one of the ones that take you into Edinburgh's 'underground city,' it's really interesting. 

If the weather's nice, you might want to take a walk up to Calton Hill or Arthur's Seat. If you want something indoors, there's the Museum of Scotland (although I've never been so don't know what it's like), or the Edinburgh Dungeon, but that's probably of more interest to kids. If you want to travel a bit further afield, there's the Falkirk Wheel, too.

In Glasgow, there's good shopping and there are lots of museum/art gallery type stuff you can do. There's the Burrell Collection (very cultured), Kelvingrove museum, House for an Art Lover (a Rennie Mackintosh building), the Science museum, or if you're not sure, there are bus tours you can go on from the city centre to lots of places. I think you can get on and off them as you please, if something grabs your fancy. 

The city centre or the west end of Glasgow have some good places to eat. I'd recommend Ashton Lane in the west end if you like a bit of jazz/live music while you eat (or maybe not, if you don't like students...).

Can't really help you with the rest, it's been years since I've been to any of them, but in London you should be able to get a map of the underground easily enough, and that will help you plan things out, the tourist spots at each station are clearly marked.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"What I would like to see ideally (so it's never going to happen) is an overhaul of our central and local government system. In effect, what you'd have is this:

* At the Parish level, local volunteers with responsibilities for maintaining things at parish level, budgets promulgated from local area councils. The ability to call for a vote and make anything law at the local level (not new laws, just the ability to overturn laws made higher up) provided the turnout is greater than 75%.

* At the local area level (consider it to be borough or city level) an elected council accountable to the people with the ability to overturn laws made from above and responsible for things that councils typically provide.

* A council of councils for each area in the county. This wouldn't hold any significant power but would be a regular meeting of nominated representatives with support for resource sharing and working together. The national government would be directly accountable to the council of councils.

* A national parliament for each of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as for each territory that requires one. This would be directly elected by representatives. Political parties would not be permitted - everyone would be an independent. Every expenditure at this level would be public information available on the Internet. The national parliament can be dissolved by the council of councils for that country.

* A cut down British parliament - in effect a cabinet and council of councils at the UK level, with 3 representatives from each country. The role of the British parliament will be one of facilitating co-operation at the national level and conducting certain functions that cannot be done at a national level (e.g. defence minister, security functions, foreign functions etc.). The British parliament could propose laws (which will have to be debated and voted on at national level) but would have no power to vote. The British parliament would report to the head of state and the head of state would have the power to dissolve parliaments/councils at any level but no ability to intervene in any other way. There would be no house of lords.

* At any level, any public officer can be removed if a petition to remove them collects signatures from more than 20% of their electorate. In the event of that officer being removed, either that level of government can elect a new officer internally or it can be thrown out to public election.

I realise that such a system would not be without flaws. After all, our current system has many flaws. I do believe that a government closer to the people, voted in by the people and voted out by the people would be better, and that transparency cannot be more necessary for such a government to function.",0,1299418603,null,0,false,0,c1jk2ei,t3_fxbvg,t1_c1jk2ei,t1_c1jjzzl,1426965160,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
