Edit: While the details are obviously very out of date (you can in fact say ""bloody"" now) many of the core points still hold, for example:

&gt; **British reserved, not unfriendly**. You defeat enemy propaganda not by denying that these differences exist, but by admitting them openly and trying to understand them. For instance: The British are often more reserved in conduct than we are. On a small crowded island where forty-five million people live, each man learns to guard his privacy carefully - and is equally careful not to invade another man's privacy.

&gt; So if Britons sit in trains or busses without striking up conversation with you, it doesn't mean they are being haughty and unfriendly. Probably they are paying more attention to you than you think. But they don't speak to you because they don't want to appear intrusive or rude.

Another great book is [Watching the English](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Watching-English-Hidden-Rules-Behaviour/dp/0340818867), which is thoroughly entertaining but also contains a lot of interesting analysis of our behaviour.

Speaking personally, the most annoying things are claiming you won ""the war"" for us (just don't - I can go into more depth if you want to know why, but just don't say that and you'll be fine) or acting like your way of doing things or how your country is is better. Our country is different to yours. Not worse. Different. (Can you tell I've been rubbed up the wrong way by 'merkans before? :P)

In closing, again from the Instructions for American Servicemen in Britain:

Addressing strangers as Sir/Ma'am/Miss. It sounds really quaint. The only people who say that are people who work in shops, restaurants and hotels, and servants.

Getting place names wrong. Say ""Lye-sester Square"" and you might as well have an arrow over your head saying ""ignorant American"". ""Leicester Square"" is pronounced ""Lester Square"". No one minds ""Bucking-Ham Palace"", though (we say ""Bucking-uhm Palace"").

Fortnightly recycle collections are fine as they don't decompose and attract insects and vermin unlike general food and other non recyclable waste.

I agree on the cuts, they are simply not on when we just blew 1.5 billion bombing Libya and god only knows how much on the coming Olympics, but in comparison to some of the ways we throw good money after bad its at least a direct benefit for a lot of people who have been struggling with such a system for a while.

I think The Curse Of The Black Spot is heavly underrated. It maybe sometimes a bit low budget or a bit one-shotty and quirky but I think that is what we loved in the past seasons of Doctor Who.

Hell, if it were all made of story arcs and in comfort-story-telling zones we wouldn't have Blink.

So, I think its a great episode and I hope to see more of the likes on Season 7.

PS: A Good Man Goes to War DELIVERED.

PSS: While I loved the overall story of The Doctors Wife I kind of don't like so much the idea of a human TARDIS. I like to think it is like a living-inanimate-thing.

It's not really that weird. I'm barely treading water at the moment, overdraft is maxed, gone past it, can't keep up with my loan payments.

So I listen, and I do some maths... their proposal is to roll my *interest free overdraft into the one big debt, resulting in me paying *more* back per month, for a longer period of time. Cheers, Natwest.

If you look at how banks behave, from my level, to the level of countries borrowing, their behaviour is very inconsistent and contradictory. They'll recommend one thing to a developed country and something else to a less developed country (like: get rid of all your food stockpiles and crush small businesses). The only consistency to their behaviour is: What makes them the most money?

The fact is that the private sector has to fund public sector pensions, and these days private sector people are lucky to have a job at all, or to even have their pay frozen.  
  
I'd love to be able to afford to just give everybody £20,000 a year for doing nothing, but we can't afford it.  The money just isn't there, so the public sector simply has to suck it up this time.  
  
With regard to the firing problem, it's just personal and 2nd hand experience.  People just being bad at the job are never sacked, and even people stealing from the 'company' is often ignored because the bosses don't want to make a fuss.  I'm not claiming any objective data, but I think I have sufficient reason to believe it's not isolated.  
  
Union are definitely a problem.  The concept of a union is fantastic - workers need to collectively bargain to redress the balance of power that would otherwise swing far too much towards management.  But union *leaders* are largely just a bunch of class warfarists who love nothing better than leaping on any excuse to strike, even if it's nothing to do with their own industry.  A good union leader understands that the continued profitability of the business is necessary for the members to stay employed.  A bad union leader will see the business itself as the enemy.  Sadly, I feel that the main large public sector unions all fall into the latter category.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;But since we're not asking other European nations to fund our public sector pensions, that's irrelevant

No it isn't. It means countries that are considerably less affluent provide better pension provision than we do.

&gt;The fact is that the private sector has to fund public sector pensions

You make it sound like a benevolent donation, not deferred payment for work done. 

&gt;private sector people 

What is a 'private sector person' exactly? Surely any worker at the moment is lucky to have a job in either sector. People often don't work exclusively in one sector all their life, and both sectors are interdependent.

&gt;But union leaders are largely just a bunch of class warfarists who love nothing better than leaping on any excuse to strike, 

This is not backed up by the facts at all. Strikes in this country have been declining for some time, and union leaders seem to my mind seem extremely reluctant to use the strike weapon. When they do, it is backed up by a democratic process. The more firey rhetoric is normally deployed to avoid radical elements 'outflanking' the leaders from below. Lets be clear. It is workers themselves that decide to go on strike and nobody enjoys doing so. It is normally an act of desperation.

&gt;A good union leader understands that the continued profitability of the business is necessary for the members to stay employed. A bad union leader will see the business itself as the enemy. Sadly, I feel that the main large public sector unions all fall into the latter category.

A good union leader reflects the voice of his or her members. Not sure which ""concept of unions"" you are using, but by most measures unions are considerably more 'pro-business' and less socialist than they have ever been.

Both Avebury and Stonehenge have been 'repaired': Stonehenge had several monoliths lifted back into place and concreted to stop them moving, while a number of the stones at Avebury were unearthed and re-erected [by an archaeologist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Keiller) who bought much of the land to preserve it.

&gt; Buried stones, some up to a metre below ground, were uncovered and replaced in their original stone-holes.

Fair enough they're the original stones in the same place, but it's not as original as you might think. Probably doesn't matter as they're still great places.

Compare Stonehenge [before](http://heritageaction.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/stonehenge_18771.jpg) and [after](http://www.lrfdecor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Stonehenge.jpg). Photos are taken from pretty much the same angle - You can see how wonky some had become. They were righted and secured, along with other work.

Further to your suggestions: Silbury Hill and West Kennett Longbarrow. Both are close to Avebury and are pretty damn funky. [Also check out the shrine in the west corner of the field opposite and east of the Hill (centre of the map linked is where the shrine is)](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ll=51.411775,-1.856003&amp;spn=0.009034,0.022724&amp;hnear=Bristol,+City+of+Bristol,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=h&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;z=16). Lots of ribbons and offerings and whatnot left by people who believe in such things.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You make it sound like a benevolent donation, not deferred payment for work done.  
  
I said nothing about benevolence - it's mandatory.  Private sector workers fund the majority of public sector pension costs.  Even [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/dec/13/pensions-public-cost-funding) doesn't dispute this:  
  
&gt;**The Guardian**  
&gt;The government paid retired public sector workers £21bn in 2007-08 ... But this ignores two key issues. The lion's share of contributions were paid by employers, which are funded by the taxpayer. Employee contributions are nearer £7bn.  
  
It is entirely reasonable to ask public sector workers to contribute more than 33% of their own pension payments (especially when their salaries are funded through taxes in the first place), and striking over such an increase is downright disrespectful.  
  
&gt;It is workers themselves that decide to go on strike and nobody enjoys doing so. It is normally an act of desperation.  
    
And they get led by union bosses, who sometimes don't even put offers to vote by the members - they just say 'oh it was a shit offer - we recommend you strike'.  Union bosses were urging their members to join the wildcat strikes a couple of years ago, Bob Crowe famously walked out of negotiations saying he had a strike to organise, the guy from Unite was paying more attention to his PDA during negotiations a while back....  
  
I'm never going to believe that the bosses of the big influential unions are in it for their members.  They've proved time and time again that they're in it for themselves.  
  
&gt;Not sure which ""concept of unions"" you are using  
  
The point of unions is to provide collective bargaining power for workers who would otherwise be run roughshod over.  They're supposed to promote equitable dialogue between management and workers over conditions and pay, but modern big union bosses treat them more like political parties to try and influence government policy.",0,1317409793,null,0,false,0,c2nuohx,t3_kwl0w,t1_c2nuohx,t1_c2nu2ti,1427668984,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

1.) *The Doctor's Wife* -- This has to be not only my favorite episode of the season, but one of my all-time favorites, as well.

2.) *The Girl Who Waited* -- I'm not even a big fan of Amy, and I wept openly at this one.

3.) *A Good Man Goes to War* -- I agree with Resilience: this episode DELIVERED.

4.) *Day of the Moon* -- I'm not going to lie, I may just be biased towards this because part of it took place in my home state. But the way they beat the Silence was just epic.

5.) *The Impossible Astronaut* -- Again, there's that home-state bias (I've been to the part of Lake Powell where they filmed a million times!), but it really was the best season opener we've ever seen, if a tad frustrating.

6.) *The God Complex* -- I actually really liked this one. A cool idea and a freaky hotel, as well as some interesting characters.

7.) *Let's Kill Hitler* -- A good episode, but I kind of hate how the River storyline has been hijacking the season.

8.) *The Almost People* -- I actually quite liked this, if in part because it proved my theory about Amy to be spot-on. 

9.) *Night Terrors* -- A great idea, but I just wasn't satisfied with the resolution.

10.) *Closing Time* -- I like Craig, I really do, but this episode was just...awkward. They could have done a lot better.

11.) *The Rebel Flesh* -- Interesting concept, but it just dragged too much.

true,janoo1989,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I'm surprised that *Talons of Weng Chiang* and *Genesis of the Daleks* are in the top 5 fan favourites. Both are 6 parters that really drag.

*Talons of Weng Chiang* was incredibly slow and had the Doctor shooting a giant rat (a normal rat zoomed in) with a rifle. The Asian stereotyping in that episode is extremely painful to watch in 2011. The most embarrassing part is [John Bennet](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F_GgpYlflKw/TW-7V0FgwkI/AAAAAAAAEaQ/kFDFICpCeo4/s400/j_bennett.jpg), wearing some god-awful make-up to play the villainous Chinese magician, [Li H'sen Chang](http://www.wearysloth.com/Gallery/ActorsB/tve1343-19770226-98.jpg). Being an Asian, I'm not saying I'm offended. After all, this was a product of its time (like a lot of great Classic *Who* episodes) but it's the kind of thing that warrants a facepalm.

As for *Genesis of the Daleks*, it gave us Davros and an amazing introduction but apart from that, it just dragged its feet through at least 4 of the 6 episodes. 

If you're looking for some great Tom Baker serials, I'd highly recommend *City of Death,* written by Douglas Adams (highly accessible, with terrific dialogue).

I eventually gave up on inkjets and bought a colour laser (Konica Minolta Magicolor 255DN) and I've never looked back.  I've had it about 3 years now, and although I don't print much (maybe 20-30 pages a week), I'm still on the original toner cartridges.  I wouldn't waste my money on an inkjet again, unless, perhaps, I need to print lots of high quality photos every day and then I would spend the money on a professional quality HP.  

TL;DR: inkjets look cheaper at first glance, but they cost you more in the long run.

PS  Canon scanners are cheap (&lt;£50) and do the job fine.

Those gullible workers being led up the garden path by their evil union overlords. Shockingly, people have minds of their own. You use highly selective examples, particularly with RMT which is a special case. Most union leaders are incredibly moderate. To much so IMO.

&gt;Bob Crowe famously walked out of negotiations saying he had a strike to organise

Workers have the democratic right to use the power to withdraw their labour, and organise in the workplace in order to defend their conditions or improve them. If they didn't the history of the last century would have been starkly different.

&gt;The point of unions is to provide collective bargaining power for workers who would otherwise be run roughshod over. They're supposed to promote equitable dialogue between management and workers over conditions and pay, but modern big union bosses treat them more like political parties to try and influence government policy.

Isn't that what their doing right now? The unions have plenty to be angry about, having only agreed a few years ago to raise the retirement ages and increase contributions over time. The state is the countries largest employer by far, and so requires strong trade unions to keep it in check.
