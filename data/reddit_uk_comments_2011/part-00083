The euro crisis and the future of individual nations within the EU.

As many many many people advised at the time, the euro was a terrible idea with a plethora of flaws. However, these were deliberate flaws potentially designed to eventually create an economic crisis which would force independent nations within the EU to sign up to complete fiscal and political union in a way which would be impossible had Markets be calm and everything calm.

A lot of the suggestions are deliberately stupid and designed to fail such as the tobin tax. This was proposed as it would primarily effect London. They estimated that this tax would raise £57bln a year, £40bln of which would come from the UK. Effectively we would be paying for a bailout fund for the euro, a currency which we have no intention of joining.

I really am by no means hold a strong political allegiance apart from thinking ed balls is a dangerous man but it's slowly becoming apparent that Europe is transforming into a greater Germany with France taking the position of chief fluffer.

And I said, ""Oh no. It's not *another* medical drama is it?""

She told me it was about this 900 year old alien traveling through time and space in a blue police box. I just gaped at her. And then she told me about how this guy reincarnates his face and how there are old ones, and I had to ask if I'd have to watch all those. She said not, and I had thought to myself, ""Good, because there's no way I'm watching OLD tv."" (which I hated at the time). And then, she mentioned salt-shaker aliens. Which by that point, wasn't too weird.

I went home and YouTubed it. The first thing I saw was some skinny *idiot* shouting about everything in front of him. And then the next brief clip I saw was of a red bus flying through a desert chased by manta rays. And I went ""Oh *HELL* no!""

It was not until she sat me down in front of Blink months later that I saw it again. On Youtube after the first video part ended, she told me, ""You don't have to watch anymore if you don't want to.""

And I, ""No, no, it's fine. Play the next bit.""

K-9 Mk II was built by the Doctor and travels with him and Romana. This one stays with Romana in E-Space. In the Eighth Doctor version of Shada, apparently he came back to Gallifrey with her. Meaning there were presumably two K-9s there?

I'm ideologically opposed to Tory values. I believe they're self-serving, and seek to benefit the individual. This is fine if you assume that everyone has equal opportunity to ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps"", but I don't believe equality of opportunity exists. The Tories are for maintaining the status quo, and aren't interested in increasing social mobility. I believe that's a fundamentally immoral and flawed position, particularly when it's presented as an ideology to people that can't prosper under that system, by people that can (and will continue to do so). I'm not rabid about it, and I don't advocate class war, I just strongly disagree with it, and I really don't believe their motivations are particularly pure and altruistic. 

However, the alternatives - Labour and the Lib Dems - are almost equally distasteful to me. As you point out, the Labour Party's shift to the right over the past 20 years has been incredible, and they got lots of things wrong in government. They're mostly all career politicians (an accusation you can level at all the parties, of course), and they're toeing the line, earning a living by being opposed to something. Tony Blair is pretty much Satan incarnate to me - and that's *despite* the good and progressive things he did. 

TL;DR Politicians are all much the same: self-serving cuntbags with the moral and intellectual authority of five year olds, although I admit I find this particular crop of Tories particularly unpleasant.

I was a bit like, ""ah shut up you daft cheese head youre talking rubbish"".

But he was right, and its an attitude that I find from a lot of people on the continent, not everyone supports Europe, but those that do tend to see it as an agreement between friends, and this is key, they are our friends, the majority of Europeans, particularly Germans and Dutch, they both adore our nation funnily enough - particularly the Germans who carry nothing but admiration for us. We are sat out on an island (the Germans call us monkey islanders, the cheeky bastards) on our own spewing our own hatred for others based on historical events that are long finished and no longer carry any real resonance because we became friends and this is key to what Europe is really about, its a partnership of friends its never just been about business and trade, and our government has just fucked them finally completing a process a process that the Iron Liar (the evil lying witch whore of Grantham) began. 

Of course our politicians want more and more power and more decisions but do you really actually genuinely trust them? they whole lot of them are a bunch of liars, crooks and scumbags, there are only a handful among the lot who hold any true conviction for serving the nation - there are notable exceptions. Their main goal is climbing the ladder and getting to a position where they can lie with influence, where their lies actually have an effect. Pond life, labour, tory, liberal they are mostly all bastards on a career ladder that puts their egos and their careers before the of the country, take the whips for example the most undemocratic process of them all, every MP should be given a free vote on every issue.

Anyway back to the point, we have just shafted them in their hour of need, and said literally we dont want to be in their club of friends at a very critical moment. That really is not very nice, our economy is weaker than the rest of Europe because they have been getting their strategy on how to reinvigorate our economy completely wrong, in a recession you dont cut spending you increase it, because that puts money back into the economy, they've only realised this now and we are starting to hear about public infrastructure schemes. The British public made a mistake voting them in because their party does not have the foggiest about how to run an economy they are consumed by mantra, they arrogantly think capitalism is going to save us, and it is  exactly that that has screwed us.

We are the sixth largest economy in the world because we have a group of friendly nations we trade with, Europe has been massively massively massively beneficial to our economy. I really truly hope they do not hold this decision against the people, because the people of the counry are not to blame for the short sighted and frankly unfriendly decision of an idiot politician and his corrupt and self interested ""business advisors"".

We've now moved our financial industry closer to that of the cayman islands, the place people come to avoid restrictions, but it is exactly that lesson that needed to be taught. 

The financial industry take the piss and threaten to move their operations elsewhere if we become more restrictive, my answer would be fuck 'em, let them go, we dont need to be threatened, they do good business in our country so they are not fucking threatening, but it absolutely plain and clear, they will spend the rest of their lives to drag their arses to jail for their insider trading practices and their tax avoidance schemes and the corruption that absolutely does take place in that industry, they are not honest, the level of corruption that goes in that industry is disgusting.

I wonder if you've seen the interview, he made a throw away joke about the BBC needing to be impartial,  Which was then taken out of context.

Not only is it obvious what he's joking about  from a transcript, it's a million times more obvious if you watch the video and listen to his tone of voice.  The joke was about the BBC, not the strikes.

I also noticed while looking for the video on youtube, nearly all of them cut out his comment before that line.  Surprise surprise.

Clarkson may be a boring knob, but nowhere near as bad as the people that were offended by this comment.

Matt Baker: Do you know anyone who has been on strike today?

Jeremy Clarkson: Of course I don't, no. What, somebody public service? No, I don't. No, absolutely. But we have to balance this though, because this is the BBC.

Matt Baker: Yes, exactly.

Jeremy Clarkson: Frankly, I'd have them all shot. I would take them outside and execute them in front of their families. I mean, how dare they go on strike when they have these gilt-edged pensions that are going to be guaranteed while the rest of us have to work for a living?

As to tax levels, there was nothing in the proposals for that to be set by Brussels.

Finally, if the EU has to approve out budgets, we may not be allowed to de-value the pound. Which is the only thing keeping us from being Greece 2.0.

edit: From their overwintering fact sheet:

If a hedgehog is found sleeping out in the open, away from the nest, it is not hibernating and is probably suffering from hypothermia and in need of attention. Take it indoors - an outbuilding is not warm enough - place it on a towel-wrapped warm hot water bottle and wait for it to stir. If it doesn’t it may have died, but it’s worth checking. Medical assistance can be given by a local wildlife rescue centre, with the direction of a sympathetic vet. Hartmanns fluids, warmed, can be given under the skin and dexamethasone injected to improve circulation, along with covering antibiotics.
When the hedgehog shows movement it should be offered Lectade (Pfizer) to drink or Dioralyte.This is available from vets. No solid food should be given for 12 hours, after which a liquid food, like Ensure or Complan, can be offered.

true,edsballs,null,null,"Yeah nobody gives a passing thought to the UK granted. The UK understands that very clearly and most of it boils down to the fact that UK parties have been saying the euro was a mistake since it's inception.

The UK has been marginalised in the union because it doesn't sing from the right song sheet. Why would anyone in Europe care about the UK when a number of it's politicians have been sticking their fingers up at it for decades.

However, despite it's irrevelence the UKs financial contributions are extremely welcome. London provides the major European financial hub to compete with TK and NY... It would be pretty embarrassing, cute even, to pretend that Paris, Frankfurt or Brussells could do the same.

Despite the UKs irrelevance a number of European leaders (up for re-election soon) have been quick to point the blame at Anglo Saxon capitalism for it's own European sovereign debt crisis. Who might the Anglo saxon capitalists be?

The US and the UK...

Yet, the EU are happy to ask for an unprecedentedly large bail out from the US federal reserve and lets be honest, if London accounts for 80% of all financial transactions in Europe, who is going to be the overwhelming looser from this dangerously poorly researched Tobin tax proposal? The UK. I suspect that with Britain outside of the agreement the new tax won't go ahead.. 

We should check back in a few months and see if it's been brought in.... I'll make a sportsmans bet with you... 10 euros that without London the EU won't bother introducing a transaction tax. I will honestly pay.

I would like to point a few things out however, I am half 'Continental European' and spend a lot of time speaking and working with friends and colleagues across the continent. Until a couple of years ago when other priorities took over I would spend a lot of time over on the mainland. I never read the Daily Mail. 

I am not anti EU, it's a good idea very poorly executed in my opinion. A lot of my family and friends on the continent feel the same but I'm not the sort of person who will spit in your face and tell you that it's raining. It's all an embarrassing disaster and this agreement, Britain or no Britain does nothing to address the underlying issue. 

Let's have a look at the bottom line,

The one country who stood to lose £40bln a year vetoed.
Europe is no closer to fixing the Euro crisis it has been struggling for about 2 years now.
Markets still think European Leaders are the morons in this debacle.
Europe is one step closer to being a unified state.

Also, I think it is a bit silly for you to talk about little Englander huddling in their anoraks, I'm guessing that you are not much of a 'reader'. Infact, thats an outrageously stupid statement.

If judged on foreign assets held the UK is by far the largest country in the world. The UK is falling apart at home so all it has left is investing abroad. 

However, nice of you to come to the UK page to comment about how much you don't care about the UK...

As a case study of how the Daily Mail twists and distorts facts to give a false overall impression without actually *lying*, that is.

I won't bother with the list of possible ways to spend money.

I personally think bank shares are high risk and I've said why. That's it.

As for ""what would you do"". As you ask, I'd invest outside the UK and the Euro. For example the [GBP has fallen nearly 30%](http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=GBPJPY=X#symbol=;range=2y;compare=;indicator=volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=;) so investing in a stock that stands still eg a Japanese stock, would have beaten the arse off the dilapidated UK banks.

true,AgentOfMisdirection,null,null,"I just read David Cameron's demands, or prerequisites, in the FT.  Everybody would do well to step back and forget which party they support, and who is from what, and just look at the actual UK bucket list:

*(I took it from the FT which is a signup to view site, pain in the arse I know but it really is one of the best sources for such matters)*

&gt;**[A]ny agreement to tighten fiscal discipline in the 17-member eurozone should not distort the single market covering all 27 member states.** 

That the freedom of the single market is itself more important than banding countries together under fiscal restraint.

I'd have thought that one was pretty straight forward and acceptable for everyone.  The single market should be protected.

&gt;**[A] separate protocol to protect the City of London from excessive EU regulation.**  

A big red klaxon of a warning that the burden must be shared and  distributed fairly.  That a European Financial Transaction Tax would effect the UK disproportionately, for a problem that has essentially been born out of the Euro.

The UK government had already said months back that it does not object to a global Tobin tax but a European transaction tax would see London financiers move to Asia and the US.  I don't see how that's good for France or Germany either.

&gt;**[A]n agreement to let Britain enforce bank capital requirements that are HIGHER than the proposed European maximum.**

I like the idea of banks having to have more capital.  I don't like bailing banks out.  If Britain wants to go higher, set the beam higher, I don't really see why France and Germany should flinch.  Are they really suggesting that British banking should be LESS secure so it is more comparable to mainland European banks?  That's ridiculous.

Of course Britain should be allowed to set itself a *higher* standard if it should choose.

&gt;**[A]n agreement that the new European Banking Authority should remain in London.** 

If Britain had chosen to go with the reform surely the point would have been to improve stability.  In the event of it going through it would have made sense to keep things that were working and established where they were.  I can't really see what could be gained by moving it.  It's an hour or so from Brussels and in the heart of the world's number one financial centre.

&gt;**[P]rotection from EU regulation of London-based US financial institutions that do not trade with the rest of Europe.**

When in Rome, as the Romans do.  If the Yanks don't want part of Europe-proper don't make them privy to European regulation.  That Britain wanted to be able to retain a personal relationship with the US and to let Americans worry about American banks.

&gt;**[A] written guarantee – making explicit what is already the case – that unanimity should apply to any proposed “user charges” for financial groups, including any variant of the controversial European financial transactions tax.**

So basically a love letter for something that is already happening.

Every one of those points is genuinely both fair and in the interest of Great Britain.  I don't really see how poor, little UK two-tiered Europe has come off bad.  At all.  I know words like 'outside', 'two-tier', and 'cold' sound negative but *outside* is good when you're talking about a prison, a hospital or a mental asylum.  Outside is where I want to be.  'Two-tier' sounds apart, alienated; I like to think on it as exclusive,  above the rest.  Don't think of it as not being part of the crowd, think of it as having your own balcony at the opera.  Cold.  Cold is exactly what I like when talking about financial meltdowns.  Cold's a good place to be.  Britain likes cold.  It's used to it.  But we're not really out in the cold, we're out in the drizzle.  I like drizzle even more.  I even like the word.  It's mellifluent: *d r i z z l e*.  When people with their heads on fire are running around screaming, ""The UK is going to be left in the cold!"" I think of the word drizzle, close my eyes, and take in a deep breath as I  imagine the smell of freshly mown grass and petrichor.  Yes, Britain has stepped outside into the drizzle to have a cigarette whilst the rest of the European types sort out the mess they created.

I guess you can say I'm okay with what Dave did.

There's many 80's bands I don't really have this love for because they weren't in my dad's collection; e.g. Depeche Mode, Duran Duran, Sonic Youth, New Order, REM, The Cure, The Smith.

It is palpably absurd that he couldn't rely on the support of any country in Europe on this relatively trivial issue.

We're talking about Europe.  Keep up.

&gt;We could have that 'alliance' with Germany right now. IF we agree to handing over fiscal sovereignty of the UK to the EU.

No, Germany wasn't offering an alliance in return for handing over fiscal sovereignty!  Stop being so ridiculously disingenuous.  

&gt;The 'crazies' you refer to were in the European Parliament. Fuck all to do with this.

It's got everything to do with this, because diplomacy is about how you relate to individuals.  It's about interpersonal relationships.

There are three key elements to this situation:

a) Interpersonal and diplomatic relations with other nations and their perceptions of us.

b) Britain's attempt to influence how Europe managed its finances, which it predominantly does because it believes its ideas would be for the benefit of Europe.

c) Britain's attempt to secure its own unique national interests with respect to the City of London.

Because a) was lacking, as a result of things like:

- the Conservatives in the European Parliament breaking away from the mainstream

- Cameron wishing to placate his party with strong and critical rhetoric in parliament and in the press.

Britain already had got everyone's backs up.  This meant that whenever it attempted to do b), it angered the rest of Europe who saw it as Britain trying to control something they had opted out of.  This all meant that when it came to c), Britain demonstrably had no support.  Wherever the positions of the other countries in Europe have fallen now is the result of the previous 18 months.  Better statesmen would not have messed up a) and b).  There is nothing so inherently implacable about c) that Britain couldn't have won the support of plenty of other countries.

On the subject of yellow cards: Bellamy has to expect that they're inevitable the way he gets heavily involved in *every single* argument with the refs. It would seem his managers over the years have simply stopped trying to fix this aspect of his on-field persona. He usually manages to dial it back enough after he gets in hot water, though. 

I disagree somewhat with your view of Agger's. It was late and certainly would have looked reckless in real-time to the ref on the field, so I definitely don't think it was a totally bullshit call.

true,glglglglgl,blue,Misfits playlist: now complete as far as possible,"OK, no technical background other than an interest in film:

* When you can see both Rudys, but only one of them front-on and just the back of the other, they're probably using a body double. That is, someone who is roughly the same height and weight, wearing the same clothes, who stands with the back to the camera, while Joe Gilgun is the Rudy who's face you can see.
* Their scuffles are generally quite fast-moving, and there's not always clear shots of their faces. The less focused on the face is, the less it matters that the body double's face is the wrong face, because as long as it's similar enough it will still look like a blurry Joe Gilgun to the viewer.
* If you can see both of them and their faces clearly, then they're both Joe Gilgun. How? Well there's a couple of techniques that I'm aware of, each of which have dis/advantages depending on the situation. One would be to film one or both of Joe's parts in front of a green-screen, and super-impose that onto the proper recording. Another would be to literally film the scene twice, once with Joe as Rudy1 and then with Joe as Rudy2. CGI would then be used to mash the two together
* As Misfits is shot on Red, which is digital, it's likely that one of the above effects is used rather than this old film technique: the cameraman would set down the camera in one place, cover up half of the lens (or film), record onto the left half of the film, rewind the film (and move the actor to the other side of the shot), change the cover, and record onto the right-side of the film. Even that can be made into quite complex shots though, for example [this scene from Back to the Future II \(1989\) with Michael J Fox playing three different characters](http://youtu.be/5ztwns5PkJY?t=20s). That also involved an automated camera movement system that allowed the makers to perfectly replicate the camera's movements multiple times.

This used to be a lot more obvious in TV - think about any old clone/doubling episodes of sci-fi shows: one copy of the character would be on the left, the other on the right, and there would usually be a virtual line down the middle of the screen that neither would cross) but it's a perfected special effect nowadays and nearly anything is possible: doubles interacting with each other, passing each other objects, etc.

tl;dr: fighting scenes aren't too difficult because you don't see the faces that clearly, so a second person who more-or-less looks like Joe Gilgun can be used. Scenes were you can see both Rudies clearly are a bit more complex, especially if they move around the set a lot or physically interact with each other.

edit to add: of course, sometimes you can be lucky and the actor has an identical twin (Xander in Buffy, for example) making it so much easier: you often just need to dub the voice over if the twins have similar mannerisms.",0,1323548432,null,0,false,0,c36wdme,t3_n7l7i,t1_c36wdme,t3_n7l7i,1428001605,25,false,misfitstv,t5_2s8pg,25

People like to get pissed, and when they are pissed bad things happen, to them or others. They always have, and they likely always will. Go look at Hogarth's Gin Lane. Unless you want to seriously limit peoples access to alcohol (pretty intrusive by the state I think) you will always have drunken people on the streets. I reckon alcohol has been around longer than the state.

If you read the article closely, you will note that the booze bus was set up as a way to ease pressure on the ambulance and A&amp;E services. While there is a cost, this must be balanced against the cost sending police or ambulance to deal with these people when they get into trouble.

As for the fines, I can see the point yes. But remember when you start fining people you start building a beauracracy of fine collecters, enforcers, lawyers, courts etc, to back up that system and make it workable. A scheme like this probably saves us money.

Of course we used to not do anything for drunk people collapsed on the street, perhaps this would be a situation you would prefer. Just remember how much the pub industry has changed and taken over our cities, and how many people now visit them. Thousands of drunk people in every city centre on a weekend night. 

Maybe the pubs should pay more toward the clean up of drunken people.

We have a very well developed financial services industry, and the wider EU does not.  As a result of this, what is in our interests is not in theirs when it comes to regulation and taxation of relevant activities.  As much as I dislike the influence banks have on our domestic policies, I don't see that as a good reason to hurt our own chances at financial recovery for the benefit (mainly) of foreign economies.  The extra contribution from our companies (with costs passed on to you and me), would not be enough to significantly alter the direction of Europe, so I don't buy the idea that we need to do this to secure our trade links for exports.  Further to that point, with the Euro:Pound exchange rate [moving as it is](http://www.oanda.com/currency/historical-rates/), our exports are becoming less attractive to Eurozone consumers, so we're struggling there anyway and not because of an image issue.

I also care little for posturing by politicians, French or British, so Sarkozy's complaints have really only amused me.  He's certainly made himself look like a difficult fellow to negotiate with, which serves to improve Cameron's image, certainly at a domestic level.  I expect a lot of international observers will be drawing similar conclusions.  Many of them are already worried about their level of exposure to European sovereign debt and are probably considering the options of how to extricate themselves from owning those and how best to protect the value of what they hold (i.e. save the Euro).  The result of that process will be very cold and calculated, so again I'm not concerned about the bluster.  The only part of the theatre that does strike me as particularly relevant is that Cameron was brave/arrogant/dumb/your choice enough to take this all the way to veto.  My personal take is that this shows an impressive level of dedication to protecting domestic interests, especially if you take his proclamation that it is in our domestic interests as an honest expression of his opinion - whether right or wrong.

Your point 1 - I agree!
Your point 3 - yep, but there are some subtleties. For example, a company - say Tesco, might advertise for a 'designer' - but this description doesn't tell you the real nature of the job. It could be a clothes designer, a carrier bag designer or a software designer. So it's simply not possible to determine what kind of job we're talking about from the few words in the job title. So I've done it by 'sector' - the sector drop down indicates the main business activity of the employer (... there are plenty of cleaners in the NHS, but it's listed under 'public heatlhcare'). Your other comments about too many retail style options I agree with - and it's not a difficult job to try to sort them out - thanks for giving me the motivation :0)

Your point 2 - about the 'noisy' way of selecting regions. One of my main design goals was to make sure people knew just *where* the jobs they were applying for were based - too many times in the past I've chased a link to a good-sounding job to later discover it's based in Exeter - or worse, Port Talbot.

This all should have been done quietly. He needed allies on the inside. There were plenty that had issues and a more astute politician would have been sure he was going to get what he demanded before going in.

I'm not a person who judges solely on ideology. I'd rather a competent person who disagreed with me than an incompetent thinking along my lines. The problem with Cameron is he is out of his depth here and made a serious strategic error that left everyone facing the worse of all possible solutions.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, I have a friend on the PC gaming platform Steam, you see. A while back we became ""Steam friends"" because we both played Left 4 Dead 2 more than we should have, then over the next few months we began talking through Steam's IM service more often because we had similar interests (Steam, Harry Potter, etc.), and now we chat pretty much whenever the other one is online.

Anyway, backstory aside, there was an interest where my friend's opinions differed with mine: anime. I was a hardcore otaku, he compared watching anime to getting dipped in acid. So I set out to show him anime. One day, a month or two ago, he finally relented, saying ""2 episodes only"". His one condition: I would watch a single episode of Doctor Who. So, I'm like ""Pssh, okay. You British people and your British shows."" So I agree, and he links me to one episode: Blink.

*about 45 minutes later*

Me: ""Okay, that was without a doubt the best thing I have ever seen in my entire life.""

And then I went on and watched more and more episodes that either he recommended or were highly acclaimed. Rise of the Cybermen/Age of Steel, Impossible Planet/Satan Pit, Girl in the Fireplace, Army of Ghosts/Doomsday, Gridlock, and Human Nature/Family of Blood, if I remember correctly.

After that, I took the final step and started watching the entirety of the series (since 2005, of course) from the beginning. And as I type this, I have seen the entire new series, rewatched a few episodes, and I might just be able to name every single episode of all six series in order. Oh, and I'm three series done with Torchwood as well.

I think I'm one of the few, if not the *only*, who actually liked her. Probably because I've twisted her so much in my mind. 

I see Susan as a girl who ran away from home. During one of the episodes (forgive me, I don't remember which one), the Doctor says to her that she should be in school, so she didn't even graduate before she left. I imagine that one day Susan came home with devastating news about her future. From what we've glimpsed of Galifrey, it seems like a totalitarian government where their futures are decided for them. Perhaps Susan didn't like her future. She, like her grandfather, wanted to see the stars. So they stole a TARDIS and set out into the universe. Once she got there, she realizes how sheltered she was. In a totalitarian government, frightening things don't happen because they're not allowed to happen. Or maybe that incarnation of her is just chicken. Though she seems to toughen up during her last episodes on Earth.

Because Susan named the TARDIS (note that ""dimension"" isn't plural), I think she was kind of a genius mechanic that helped build a new society after the rebellion against the Daleks. I like to think that after David died, she went hunting for the Doctor, but was captured by the Time Lords and taken home. Here she could have either died during the Time War or escaped after being forced to help Rassilon, but missed the Doctor and being killed in the War. Perhaps she's traveling, looking for the Doctor because he never came back or (my favorite) perhaps she was thrown into the Time Vortex for betraying Rassilon and helping the Doctor win the war (but also killing everyone). Maybe I'm wrong, maybe she's still with David, on Earth, waiting for the Doctor to come back while slowly suffocating in the boredom of her human life style.

Anyways, that's why I like her. Because I've completely screwed up her character to make her more interesting to me. It's what Carol Ann did, she and Hartnell came up with the runaway Time Lord theory.",0,1323577133,null,0,true,0,c37010z,t3_n7pl1,t1_c37010z,t3_n7pl1,1428003431,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Why?  Allegiances are not formed on the basis of good will, the UK would just need to offer similar assurances to small states as the French and Germans do through the Euro.  Remember that many smaller states are not too keen on closer integration and don't necessarily like France and Germany. The fact that Cameron hasn't managed to convince any of them is very telling.

&gt; The other 9 non-Eurozone states will not ally with Cameron because, for some fucking bizarre reason, they are still planning on joining the Euro at some point in the future

That's because there's still lots of faith the Euro will be fixed (and it will). The closer approximation of EU states looks inevitable and with Cameron being ineffective, the UK will be increasingly marginalised.  One does wonder what the situation will be like in 20-30 years time if the UK follows in this vein; will it be locked out on the doorstep of a strong, federalised Europe?

A few random thoughts:

* You should start by writing a business plan.  It doesn't have to be anything fancy or formal, but should set out the basic details of what you're planning to do, how much it's going to cost and how you think you're going to make money from it.  You said elsewhere ""if I've done my sums right..."".  Well those sums should be written down in your business plan.

* If you can get a full-time job in the IT industry, then consider doing that for a few years to get experience of how businesses work.  

* Be flexible.  It might be that you start your company to develop and promote one particular idea/app but you end up making more money from doing something else.  You obviously know how to build web sites, so perhaps you can make ""steady money"" building web sites for local businesses while you build up your ""killer app"" for the longer term.

* Enjoy yourself.  Running a business is hard work that requires commitment, dedication, balls of steel and a sense of adventure.  It can be exciting, terrifying, rewarding and soul destroying.

Can't help you there. I know that CS is very hard, and that the bastards always steal computer room after computer room for their tutes, but that all I knows.

&gt;Accomodation prices for 2 people? Hard to find roommates?

Minimum normal rent for a single person wanting a room is about £300 per person, not including bills, for a dump. For an extra £25-75 a month you can improve the quality of the place you get significantly. Room mates aren't hard, although you'll generally end up living with friends of friends, most people don't do the whole advertising for a room mate thing, except the Chinese.

&gt;Is it hard to find a part-time job in the city?

Well, about 1/3rd of the students I know work, on the other hand there's always students quitting so if you're basically competent at life you can get and keep a job.

&gt;Any dislikes overall?

Several. Lack of culture is a problem, although things like big name comedy acts now seem to come here a lot more.

The main thing though, is that this city is dark, and it is grey. At this time of year it's dark before 4pm, on some days it never really gets bright, and with the entire city being made out of granite, that makes for one depressing winter.

Also, the weather is pretty terrible. It rains a lot, but worse, it's a really windy city, and the wind cuts you in two.

So yeah, overall, lack of culture, depressing in the winter due to lack of light, and pish weather. Still, I give the city a bad rap, it's got some cool local venues which do stuff, the people are broadly nice and decent, and AU, for all its sins, isn't a terrible uni.",0,1323597841,null,0,false,0,c37218d,t3_n7q2q,t1_c37218d,t3_n7q2q,1428004377,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Good morning - I'm a bit late to the party, but I used to work for a website that did job adverts, so I thought I'd have some good stuff to input:

* Registration is a real barrier to people applying for jobs. We discovered this when we made users subscribe on the job page. Mostly it was because people just don't remember usernames and passwords, but it also put off people who'd find the job somewhere else
* You need to think about where people enter your site and how.  Despite what you may think the majority of people aren't going to come through email alerts, they'll still search through Google.  You're at a serious disadvantage here because your job profile pages are essentially duplicate content (if it is just a scrape of the companies website) and won't rank.  
* You need to make sure you work on making your category pages more search engine friendly.  Currently you have a mismatch of urls, titles, etc.  People link to these, so you need to make sure they are consistent and understandable to someone looking at them.  You also might find it useful to put links in that take you up and down a level in the location options.
* Many people don't search for jobs by sector, but some do.  Personally I'd use your Analytics to see what common phrases people search for and creating short cuts for them.  This is easy to track in Google Analytics but requires a bit of set up.
* Your customers are the people you put ads up for.  Eventually these people will pay you the money to keep the site going.  Your users and job applicants are the things that will make your customers keep coming back. You need to keep them all happy.

Personally I'd prefer that it cost more, but we gave it to a company in this country.  At least then, in theory, we are creating some jobs in this country as well as getting a project done.

However the trouble is that we keep giving the projects to the same big organisations who don't necessarily do it in this country anyway.  They outsource it to other organisations.  What the Government should do is hire some people who can do big IT projects and sub contract the work out to lots of smaller, local organisations.

Of course the Government won't do that, because it would get accused of wasting money on management.

Just out of interest, is the NHS at the core of all your case studies because it is the only one with any data?  Presumably if a private company has a failed IT project, they'll try and make it work somehow by fudging it and then keeping quiet about it.

I'm a gay man, and occasional frequenter of gay bars. The issue isn't so much straight people being around so much that the whole idea of a gay bar (aside from extremely overpriced alcohol) is that it is a **safe space** for LGBT people, somewhere we feel comfortable to show affection/sexual interest in the same way that straight people can *everywhere else*. Straight women often go to gay bars because they want to get away from predatory straight men. Whilst I don't blame them for doing so, it does mean that eventually predatory straight men will follow them. That's where the issue really arises.

Straight people can hit on anyone they want pretty much anywhere. If the other person isn't interested, it's rarely a big deal. LGBT people can't. If an LGBT person hits on someone of the same sex in the wider world, there is a risk, and not just a perceived one - this actually happens,  that they will get *beaten to death*. If there are a lot of straight people around, some of whom are there solely to pursue women, this feels like a risk. 'Why would they be in a gay bar in the first place' I hear you ask.

Although I can understand why some gays would like a 'gay space', as the author points out, I have to say that I am not in favour of the idea: equality legislation should work both ways. I should make it clear that I'm active in the secular community and have written quite a bit (as though it matters) about such matters as the B&amp;B. I'm (*very*) pro-equality for everyone. But it is because of that that I balk at the idea of gay only hotels. Again, I can understand *why* but no... such things can't be allowed to subvert equality laws.

I've only been to one or two gay bars and I won't pretend that I am in any way a hard done by individual being as I am a white, 'middle class' educated, English male. But if I had been turned away at the door for being the wrong sexuality, I have no doubt that I would feel some degree of shame or, rather, humiliation at not being allowed in.

I personally am not homophobic or ever ridiculed someone for being gay, nor do I gawp at gay couples holding hands or kissing. So by what 'right' (for want of a better word) would someone have to turn me away at the door?

Not in Brighton we don't. 

There are ignorant fuckwits in all walks of life, just because they happen to be straight doesn't mean the minority should spoil it for the majority. 

 I don't think there are any expressly gay only bars here, I would need to check. I should be able to go to what ever bar I like, and I do. I shouldn't need a chaperone to prove I am gay-friendly :-).  You cannot go into a general bar here and not expect a percentage of people in there to be gay, it is just the way it is and no one bats an eyelid. 

Simple answer maybe to ban hen parties, they do that in some general bars. Or have a list of rules outside, that isn't uncommon for any bar. Make it humorous, "" If you are straight, please remember Gaydar does not always function well in here"", or "" if you are straight, you will be regarded as an honorary gay for the duration of your stay, and maybe experience the same norms and expectations"". 

Seriously though, LGBT peeps should feel at ease anywhere, to be safe anywhere,  to start banning a section of society, because they make you feel 'uncomfortable' and based on their sexuality is what LGBT have been fighting against for so long. To then do the opposite seems hypocritcal and will give a boost to any remaining prejudice.  Personally speaking I don't want to give the homophobes any more reason to spout their rubbish.

Stoke were solid yes, but second half were outplayed by us especially in the midfield. Our defending was scrappy throughout, but bar a few good saves from Sorenson they weren't much better.

Kaboul's problem is his temper. Understandably aggrieved from the Shawcross dragging incident, but there is no excuse for getting a yellow for dissent - every player knows that if they chase and shout the ref it'll come to a yellow and then, for a centre back, you're walking on eggshells all match.

I think playing VDV today was the wrong move, it's not his fault. He got frustrated because his creative style of play was nullified by the physical Stoke team - everyone knows that they play hard and I think 'Arry should've used him as an impact sub and gone for the more direct Defoe route.

Can't really argue with the rest of your points, apart from fuck Chris Foy and his crack team of eagle eyed linesman. As someone who qualified as a ref 3 years ago and still does the occasional county match... it's pretty odd that he missed so much.

sorry to say but of the top teams (city manu and us) we have the least dept, maybe if VDV gets injured we fall back on Sandro/defoe, but after that we have shit all, and he has had injury problems in the past.

I work with drivers (but am not one myself) and you wouldn't believe the shit they have to do, and started a hate thread is just idiotic and contributes to the negative feeling they have against them.

Bus didn't stop at your stop? Probably full or more likely has a fault that **BRITISH LAW REQUIRES IMMEDIATELY TAKING IT OFF SERVICE**. 

Bus shut the doors on you? Probably running very late or here's an idea - didn't see you because there are blind spots when you sit in the cab of a bus.

Bus driver ignores you when you get on/off? Probably having a bad day - when you deal with the idiots that they do on a daily basis they are bound to get pissed off at some point.

Driver intentionally going slow making your oh-so-important day run late? Because the bus *must* run to a timetable and if it does not then VOSA can fine and/or rescind the operator license.

Driver not letting you off between bus stops or when the bus is waiting on arriving at a stop in traffic? Again VOSA and the Traffic Commissioner do very strict and frequent checks on buses and if a driver is found to have let off a passenger before a stop they can be immediately banned from driving.

Bus running late and you're pissed at the driver? Don't be. Most likely an incident or traffic has held the bus up and believe me drivers do not like to run late because it makes them late and can cost them an early finish or break time if they have to change buses later than expected.

Bus doesn't turn up? Perhaps it has broken down. The amount of times I've heard people complain about a bus not turning up is unreal because it's impossible to know what happened to it. There are often times when a bus will fail and have to be towed (by a specialist towing company) back to the garage.

There I've said my piece now give the drivers a break and delete this flamebait of a post ;).

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"A lot of bus drivers are real assholes but unfortunately there is sometimes method to their madness. For example I've noticed that they're far more likely to leave people behind at stops where the next bus will be 5~10 minutes away, than ""middle of fucking nowhere"" stops where the next bus will be a long time.    

They still aren't exactly a joy to be around often leaving early or late just because all of the other bus drivers did the same or giving you shit for paying with anything other than exact change.   

But then again I find the other people using the bus equally irrating, often not looking for their ticket until after they board the bus, or searching every pocket on their body looking for money (or just for MORE exact change, instead of giving that 20p, let's dick around for two minutes finding that 10p!).   

Oh and don't get me started on loud people (teenagers, loud phones, or shitty headsets).   

I wish I lived in London so I could just use a magical swipe card to pay for the bus instead of dicking around with cash and paper tickets. What is this 1980?    

Plus why the fuck don't buses have GPS trackers on them? I could rig up a GPS tracker app for under a £100 which sent a text message every ten minutes to a web-site which people could check to see the location of their bus, so they don't have to stand in the fucking rain. But NO! Using modern technology is so god damn difficult for these old fucks. Fuck you First bus, fuck your PDF maps, and your shitty ass web-site.

Only in the writer's daydreams. He believes in a stereotype that left wingers are fiscally irresponsible. He must have the idea that when the left comes into power, they will always expand debt, and then later the right will rein it in. Given what I see of what Cameron is doing, and what Brown did before him, perhaps there is something to this stereotype when looking at the UK. However, ""left"" and ""right"" mean different things in various countries. The left will always lean a bit more toward social democratic policies and heavier regulation of industry. The right will always lean toward economic liberalism. However, how this manifests itself is always different.

A responsible left wing always believes in the requisite taxation to pay for big visionary public projects. A left wing  party which doesn't believe in raising taxes to pay for their big goals isn't really a left wing party at all. It's actually more to the right of center. If they believe that ""economic growth"" can always foot the bill... I would be careful about trusting their judgement.

Reading Transport seems to have it. Many of their bus signs seem to give you an estimate of when the bus is due to arrive based on where it is. But then the buses I get seem to have onboard WiFi so a 3G connection already exists - so it is trivial to fit a GPS receiver and transmit the data.

&gt;Bus doesn't turn up? Perhaps it has broken down. The amount of times I've heard people complain about a bus not turning up is unreal because it's impossible to know what happened to it. There are often times when a bus will fail and have to be towed (by a specialist towing company) back to the garage.

similar to you I work with buses (not driving) and these two confuse me the most. If they're sat on a bus sat in traffic, it's just one of those things, and they accept it. if they're waiting for one in nose to tail traffic, and it's somehow the bus drivers fault.

for the sake of argument, a bus takes half an hour for a journey every day. if you were to drive the same route in a car every day, you'd be more than 5 minutes out in rush hour one day to the next depending on traffic etc, but somehow the bus is supposed to manage it to stick to the schedule to within 90 seconds or so.",0,1323646343,null,0,false,0,c3771gr,t3_n8mjj,t1_c3771gr,t1_c37548o,1428006809,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The spokesperson's comments were simply:  

&gt; The manager has *asked* the players to look across and recognise him and his staff on the bench after a goal.  

(Emphasis mine)  



But [the Guardian reports](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/dec/11/football-news-in-brief):  

&gt; Chelsea have denied newspaper reports that their players have been instructed to include André Villas-Boas in their goal celebrations.  
&gt; A spokesman said the manager had merely *drawn his players' attention to his own goal celebrations* and those of his coaching staff in order to reinforce a sense of unity.

they author has focused on the headline figure that magically make it look like that mental health is only an issue in 2% of abortions.

if you put that in to a real perspective it looks less realistic as a headline quote to push their issue.

any unwanted pregnancy will be a situation with far higher levels of stress and anxiety which can all lead to mental health issues.

now look at the national stats on mental health and you find of the general populations which includes those in low and high stress lives that the figure are 1 in 4 suffer mental health issues!

yes 1 in 4 http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/help-information/mental-health-statistics/

from looking at it this report seems to say that the level of mental health is not linked to the abortion but to the mother, it reads that the issue is more complex and would possibly need more research. 

OW SHIT!!!! it stated the bleeding obvious

no really that's basically what they have said, mothers with unwanted pregnancy more likely to have mental health issues and yes an abortion may not fix that.

it does not say that having 198,000 babies in the care of people suffering mental health issues due to no fathers, abusive relationships, poverty, or any of the other real factors will magically make god come in to existence and make there future life's not a life of misery, neglect or abuse.",0,1323653600,null,0,false,0,c3785ss,t3_n8nqd,t1_c3785ss,t1_c377pd7,1428007331,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Surely with all those things in play they would have by now especially as it took a lot less to cause the last house price crash in the 90's. You've only a couple of years before financial experts say we'll be well on our way out of recession. **OH WAIT A MINUTE** [The crash actually happened in 2008/9!!!](http://www.housepricecrash.co.uk/indices-land-registry-national-monthly.php) **IT HAS BEEN AND GONE** and it was just over 18% from the peak in UK house prices in 2007, pretty much the same percentage drop as the last crash in the early 1990's. Since the crash in 08/09, prices have recovered by about 8%. So as we've already had the crash which was nearly two decades after the previous one, when is the next one going to be now we're slowly clawing our way out of recession? 

Do you actually even know which of the several points I made in my original post you started ranting at you are actually targetting? There seems to be quite a shotgun approach whose aim is dictated by you being proved wrong.

true,[deleted],null,null,"No, it means your gross taxable income drops by £4k. It goes as follows assuming you don't actually make a profit from the rental - i,e the interest is the same or more than the rent:

* As a salaried worker you pay tax through PAYE on £50k, about £10,100
* You have £4000 a year interest on a rental property mortgage so you claim the £4k as a tax deductible expense. Your gross taxable income for the year is now £46000 (£50k-£4k interest).
* Your annual tax bill should now be £8410
* As you have actually paid £10,100 through PAYE you have overpaid tax/NI so you would get a refund of £1690.

Because you get the £1690 back, your actual out of pocket cost of the mortgage interest isn't £4000 but £2310 as the govt have basically ""refunded"" you £1690 of the interest.

Now this is where it becomes more interesting for people who are on lower incomes where they are just above or qualify for tax credits and/or other means tested benefits. Their annual income for benefits purposes isn't what they pay through PAYE but what it is after the £4k ""expenses"" has been deducted. So on a tax credit claim you wouldn't put down your income for the year is £50k but that it is £46k. For those on tax credits it would mean a rise in the amount they were paid.

People don't seem to be understanding my point: I'm not undermining the fact he's still trapped, or the allegory of him to Brooker, but more that the setting illicits this idea of those Twilight Zone type post-apocalyptic futuristic nightmares where energy is a scarce resource, and the final scene showing the world in all its beauty would prove that the cage itself is also completely unnecessary. At least if the windows are screens, then there's still some justification in the setting itself; if there is some sort of energy crisis, then they need to create energy somehow in order to keep everyone alive. A hierarchy has evolved where people provide the energy they use to survive in a harsh world of diminishing resources.

The screens at the end being windows would just be an extra little stinger after all those fantastically poignant speeches; that they don't even need to be in the cage for the survival of the species... the cage itself is an invention of higher-ups, yet another form of hamster wheel entrapment for the benefit of the elite few.

Wanted to say one thing as well: If any of you Spurs fans read the comments sections from articles about our loss today, you'll notice a relentless amount of hate from people saying ""Spurs will never finish top-4"" or ""Spurs will be lucky to even qualify for Europa"". I want to remind everyone to stay classy, this is a very tough loss to swallow, but there is an undeniable reason why it seems to many people lavish the opportunity to jump on Spurs

Here's why: These people are threatened. The established order of the PL prior to 09/10 was ManU, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool. Now that Man.City have done what they have, and Spurs have gone on this amazing run, the playing field is leveling out VERY quickly. A lot of people believed that 09/10 was a fluke and this year most pundits picked Tottenham to finish 6th. Prior to today, Tottenham were playing lights out, and there is no reason going forward that they can't continue to challenge at the top. This scares Chelsea, Liverpool, Man. United, Arsenal fans to death. Prior to the abysmal first-half today, we were the toast of the PL, whether the fans of the other top teams want to admit it or not. So do not succumb to the moronic people relentlessly bashing Tottenham right now, these people are simply afraid that Spurs are finally starting to break their mold. One match and one referee do not decide a season, this is just a bump in the road.

&gt;how do you think electricity is produced? One form of energy is converted into another. How do you think a wind-up torch works?

I've been hit on a few times at gay bars, and I've always just said ""sorry I'm straight"", and no problems.

[here](http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/x-factor/praise-the-lord-konnie-huq-sacked-from-the-xtra-factor/) 


&gt; Konnie Huq seemed a surprise replacement for Holly when it was announced back in June this year, with the likes of Christine Bleakley and Kimberley Walsh being strongly rumoured to take on the show. The petite host’s first appearance on the programme immediately drew criticism from fans, who blasted her for being unfunny and cringeworthy.

&gt; A production source said today: “Simon Cowell hasn’t been impressed and it seems certain she will be axed. Every week there seems to be a new mistake.”

&gt; Despite Konnie’s cock-ups however the show saw its highest ratings ever this year, with over 2.31 million viewers tuning in compared to last year’s 1.8 million.

2.  Put it somewhere you'll remember
3.  Right click on your desktop
4.  Click 'Personalize'
5.  Click on 'Desktop Background' at the bottom
6.  Change the picture location to the folder you created before
7.  Click 'Select All'
8.  Select the duration of time you want between image swaps. (I like 30 seconds to a minute)
9.  Save changes and enjoy an appearing and disappearing TARDIS!

Immediately following each unpleasant new announcement, Cleggsy Bear shuffles on stage to defend it, working his sad eyes and boyish face as he morosely explains why the decision was inevitable – and not just inevitable, but fair; in fact possibly the fairest, most reasonable decision to have been taken in our lifetimes, no matter how loudly people scream to the contrary."" - Charlie Brooker.

And also a ""stupid reason"" to the doctor might seem more serious to the person involved. For example if a child took three or four multivitamins, that might seem ""silly"" to a doctor but to a worried parent that might be life or death.  

Also, if you're the sick person you often have poorer judgement than you normally would. Once when I had a 24 hr bug that resulted in things shooting out of both ends, and I literally felt like I was dying, and thought about wasting NHS direct's time with it, but now it seems silly/stupid.

The people were trapped in little boxes, constantly staring at screens, forced to perform seemingly pointless mindless tasks with no understanding of where they fitted into the world. They were encouraged to form their sense of identity by purchasing things and feeling superior to those worse off. All of that works as a fantastic allegory for our lives.

______________________________


I think you're making the mistake of not wanting to agree with/listen to Dawkins because you don't like him as a person, for some reason. That might be completely legitimate and I know plenty of atheists, even, who think like that. But I get the impression you didn't read the article.

If you had then maybe you would have addressed his point, noting that Cameron's response to his question was laughable and arrogant, as well as dismissive and missing the point entirely.

You think Dawkins is a smug cunt, which I can understand, but I will poke you about your assertion in why Dawkins thinks Kurt Wise is a ""disgrace to the human species"". But I shouldn't have to: You linked to it already, but I don't think you really reflected on what Dawkins was actually saying.

The entire quote:

&gt; ""... the most extreme case is the geologist Kurt Wise, who has a PhD in geology from Harvard. And said ""If all the evidence in the universe pointed towards an old earth I would be the first to admit it, but I would still be a Young Earth Creationist because that is what holy scripture teaches me.""    
You cannot argue with a mind like that. A mind like that, it seems to me is, well, a disgrace to the human species.""

Dawkins is not commenting on Wise's belief in a god specifically but rather he is reflecting on the fact that Wise, a scientist who has obtained the recognition of an institution like *Harvard* who awarded him a doctorate, has openly admitted that he would ignore any and all evidence to the contrary in favour of a very old holy text.

Dawkins abhors such intellectual dishonesty. He is making the point that when it comes to people like that, **no** evidence will shift them. This close mindedness is, in his opinion, disgraceful. I tend to agree, though I will not call someone a disgrace *just* because they have a belief in a deity. Neither I'm sure, does or has Dawkins.

Do you have evidence to the contrary?

true,widgetas,null,null,"Can you quote or point out exactly where Dawkins says anyone is a ""bad Christian""? Specifically this linked article. I think you're attacking from a slightly misguided angle and, like Cameron, missing the issue.

If you're referring to the assertion makes that Dawkins makes with regards to whether or not Cameron is actually a Christian, his point is that the PM is, perhaps, 'not religious enough' in the sense that it his apparent level of faith doesn't justify his willingness to have children indoctrinated at faith schools as a matter of course.     
By the way, if you're of the opinion that children *aren't* being indoctrinated in faith schools, I would really like to hear your reasoning. I'm not just saying that or being flippant: I'm interested in how people can justify faith schools without the religion angle being important. If you do think that way, then please let me know why?

&gt; That is his problem and he should keep it to himself.

I really have to question why people must find ways to dismiss people like Dawkins. If you think he's a dick: Fine. But that doesn't mean you can ignore anything and everything he says as a matter of course. Many other people hold the same opinions. Considering the issues being raised, in particular in this case: ""Why are politicians so intent on allowing religious organisations to force their beliefs on children?"", I would have thought more people could understand the problem.

The [British Social Attitudes survey](http://ir2.flife.de/data/natcen-social-research/igb_html/pdf/chapters/BSA28_12Religion.pdf) reported last week that **50%** of people fall into the ""No religion"" category. When you consider those who ticked ""Have a religion (cultural or otherwise)"", you find that 56% never attend religious services.

At the very least it would appear that half the British population are not religious. At the most, something like three quarters *plus* are not religious in the active sense. And yet *two thirds* of state schools are faith schools!

WHY!?  Why must schools be run by religious organisations? The answer is obvious: Because it means they can teach children to be that particular religion. But that doesn't tie in with the feelings and belief of the general public.

To someone like myself, I find the idea of my child (should I ever have any) going to a faith school of *any* kind, to be as troubling/disturbing an idea as it would be to your common or garden Christian if their child had to go to a Muslim school or a Hindu school faith school. I wonder how many people have considered that: How many Christians (active or cultural) do you think would be happy with their child being taught in a school that was 'of the Muslim' faith? (This is not implying they're Islamophobes, but Islam is the best example to use here). I would say: not many. And that is precisely how many of us without religion feel.

If you (a religious person) wouldn't like your child being subjected to an education that has a constant background of a different religion to your own, then why do you (a religious person) think it's fine for those of us (and our children) who do not have a religion to be subjected to that/your religion at school? It's OK for families who are that particular religion, but everyone else can lump it?

The point is: The CHILD is not a particular religion, even the religion of their parents. So why must successive governments, and many religious members of the public, think it's a great idea for schools to have a faith element in the background all the time?

I totally agree, it's a good and sober reflection.

---

I can't help to think that we're in bad luck regarding the penalties at the moment.

I feel that we somewhat lost the game vs PAOK because we got a penalty as well as one of them got a red card. It changed the whole game. There were hardly no space left for us to exploit and PAOK set up a strong 10-man defence that we just couldn't penetrate.

I honestly think that if PAOK would have been 11 players we could at least have made it a draw. Sure, they might have counter-attacked in 0-4 or something, but it would have left the areas open for us to exploit.

Yesterday we all know there should at least have been a red card and a penalty for the hand/arm save on the goal line, or a penalty a few seconds earlier when Kaboul was dragged down, or even let the goal stand that Ade correctly scored a few seconds later. We didn't get the goal because of the linesman's mistake, but that's not the point.

I guess we didn't get either of the penalties because we had already gotten one (which, in all fairness, might have been a bit cheap). But it seems (to me), strangely enough, that the penalties have been more to the opposing team's favour than to ours - even though we got a goal out of each penalty.",0,1323701867,null,0,true,0,c37cyhu,t3_n8orm,t1_c37cyhu,t3_n8orm,1428009590,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

But seriously, or well.. rationally, I think 2-1 or 3-1 maybe, I hope for 3 points that is all. And a decent ref.

I would pick:

Hart, Clichy, Lescott, Kompany, Richards (is he fit? Zaba if he isn't), Barry, Yaya, Silva, Johnson, Aguero, Dzeko.

I would pick Johnson over Nasri because I think johnsons been working hard recently and he's looked good in his last few games, though I know when he starts he doesn't always work that well. I'd play him more on the right cutting in rather than right up the touchline.

I'd pick Dzeko over Balotelli because I think it'll be a heated game and well, 'nuff said.

Is Richards fit? Do we know?

You're absolutely right that they're fundamentally different players, which makes the quote a bit confusing for me as well. I don't think AVB sees Modric as an advanced midfielder, so then we don't have room in our XI for him. Romeu and Ramires are not going to be displaced by him. They're crucial to our formation. If he could slot in *comfortably* at AMF then we're talking, but now we have Meireles and Lampard. Sure, Lamps is getting old but him and Raul are putting in some fine performances, not world beating but pretty good, and Mata comes central and does some of Modric's job there too.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Heres a run down of the three tendencies, in my view, that create ""public order situations"" out of protests:

The bloc, generally, try to avoid the police and attack property. For them, attacking the manifestation of capital on the street is its own justification. In anarchist theory its called 'propaganda of the deed', which was essentially a euphemism for acts of terrorism in the 19th century. There was actually quite a lot of backlash among the radical left 'activists' against the bloc after march 26th. That was certainly the first time we've seen one that big in the UK, and it might be the last for a while.

There also, undoubtedly, some who turn up to ""have a pop at a bobby"". These are a tiny minority, but there are very dangerous for everyone involved. They are likely to hurt a random protester or passer by as a police officer. 

Finally: there is a much larger minority that believe protests have to break away from the agreed route of a march/the legal confines of protest if they are to be noticed in the media and by politicians. They consider ""A-B"" marches completely pointless. Included here are the radical left, UKuncut, occupylsx etc.

Both were liberal types, opposed to tax dodging and what not, but not the radical leftists people tend to think UKuncut are. The TSG arrived very quickly and sealed the doors. A large crowd started to build and a few people tried to climb in through the windows.

I don't ultimately have much of a problem with the police response.. I have my own views about private property, capital and what not, but don't really hold it against police officers when they try to stop occupations. I was odd though that the chief inspector in charge had told people inside they were going to be let go, and then suddenly the plan changed. 

To my mind, disrupting the running of a single store involved in a tax controversy is no more disruptive than snarling up the capitals transport with protesters. According to [private eye](https://skitch.com/politicalcustard/r39nr/fm-private-eye-1286) the Met tasked 25 counter-terrorism officers to deal with the 138 charged. How that is in the public interest I don't know. 

The arrests were used for political reasons. Theresa May made a lot out of them in parliament and the press, deliberately not distinguishing between the occupiers and those who had attacked shops earlier in the day to make herself look good.

Ultimately, if I am breaking the law with a political aim then I am not going to be bitter about being arrested. That said, the mass arrest of F+M lot seems like a bit of joke when most of the bloc got away with it.

I picked St Martins College to study my degree as it was closest to the source of what I wanted to do (fashion is London based like woah) and it gave me an Old Boy's Network to abuse. 

Art colleges are specialised and come with their own set of alumni to use and abuse. i cannot reccomend going to one enough if you actually want to make money as an artist type after. ",0,1323715157,null,0,false,0,c37eykm,t3_n9lpa,t1_c37eykm,t1_c37ess9,1428010599,1,false,Portsmouth,t5_2sjg1,1

true,Gourmay,cnty-uk,Frog-Yank import,"Yes but, to answer the question, about ten years ago, when I was actually in a music school, I auditioned for where I was living's version of pop idol. I wanted to see what that world was like because although I do rock music I happen to have a good voice and people spent years saying 'ah it's a shame you don't want to do pretty songs' (what I do is not even close to hardcore). I already had very negative views on those shows but I always think you don't dismiss things if you don't know anything about them. I was selected out of many many many people which was the only thing I wanted to prove. I didn't go back, even then I knew what that entailed: it's a direct route to sabotaging yourself as an artist. I went, I saw, I learnt everything I wanted to know to confirm that the pop industry is not my world. It's all faker than fake and the majority of people are despicable. I could go on and tell you that the equivalent Simon Cowell saw my half-purple hair and baggy black turtleneck before hearing me and it was clear that there wasn't enough cleavage...

I've spent years learning to play electric guitar, practically my whole life writing songs, I got hired as one of, if not the only chicks working for the biggest guitar mag in the country. I'm not going to throw this all away.

A guy I did a cool song with in high school got pretty far a few years ago, got kicked off of course. The whole thing was beyond cretinous because this guy is American (studying in London) and if you get far enough in the American one, you do stand a far better chance of having a long-lasting career. Carrie Underwood is now one of the top-selling country artists in the US and the girl who won the first one is still hugely popular. But here's the catch and the fundamental aspect of these shows: this is a show for **interpreters** not artists. And the whole problem lies in the fact that we are being sold 'artists'. Not to mention that it completely kills the magic of an incredible singer when you see them struggling on a tv show before they become superstars. You should spend years honing your craft in your rehearsal room before you go public; I'm sure being famous at a young age is fun but most artists wouldn't want what they were doing at 19 to be put in the spotlight.

You suck at instruments, that's fine, there are plenty of bands out there (pop, jazz, you name a style) that just want a singer and will even write your lyrics. And that's the way you go about having a prosperous career, there ain't no way but the hard way. As a wise man said, it's a long way to the top if you wanna rock'n roll.

As a last little anecdote, I knew a few people (really talented musicians) who were being paid peanuts writing albums for some of the kids from the shows; because that's where the talent ends up today, as mere props to the shite bolloxfactor wants to sell you. EDIT: Oh and also, the claims of it being fixed are quite true although I don't know how deep that runs. What I know is that the affiliated record companies would shove some of their new protegees in the show to get them some free publicity.

Here's a super mellow cover I did years ago for my previous band's record if anyone is interested, it also features Eliott Murphy who's a big shot in the US and very talented: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrlRcespPcs",0,1323715316,null,0,true,0,c37ezka,t3_n9lvf,t1_c37ezka,t1_c37dsb9,1428010614,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

true,[deleted],null,null,"If you managed to use tax avoidance techniques to get your income down to £30k, would you go blabbing to the media how much you'd actually earned with all the witch hunts on the go?

You got told the figure that they declared as net profit on their tax return. I can assure you that was a lot less than the money that actually went in the bank. If they're managing to get their net profit down to just £30k on paper with a property portfolio that size in a time where rents are at record levels I'd say they were actually damned good businessmen and very qualified to teach people how to make money - you don't get rich needlessly paying tax you don't have to.

As you seem to not understand what I am on about as most people who have never been self employed or run a business or been in accounting don't seem to, I'll give you an example which I hope will make it a bit clearer and easier to understand why I say what I do. So here goes:

Today I went to buy stock. Its a 212 mile round trip which I do in my own car. I claim mileage at HMRC rates of 45p per mile so as far as my accounts are concerned, it cost me £95.40 to do that journey which is the amount that goes in the books as an expense. The real cost to me that I actually fork out of my own pocket is about £25 in diesel/wear and tear as I get well over 50MPG. So deductible allowance HMRC say I can claim is £95.40, real cost to me £25. OK so far?

Now say I bought three laptops (doesn't matter if I've bought more) at that auction and sold them for £30 profit each so I've made £90 in total on them. However I have £95.40 mileage expenses to offset against that £90 profit so my accounts show a £5.40 loss for the total sales for those three machines. But in reality it only cost me £25 to do that journey so I actually am up £65 in real terms which is real money I can put in the bank even though **on paper** I made a loss of £5.40.

Done right and all whilst being done perfectly legally, you can actually need to have one hell of a turnover to make £30k profit on paper. As you can see from what I illustrated above, a lot of the expenses and allowances you can claim which bring down your net profit don't actually cost you what you're claiming.

true,silletta,null,null,"I actually felt like this episode made great strides in terms of the two's friendship; it clearly showed just how much Arthur relied on Merlin's word. The first thing that showed it was when the new princess stated clearly to Merlin ""he listens to you above all others"" and asked that Merlin give her a chance. Even a newcomer could see how valuable Merlin was to Arthur. The show has never flat out said that Arthur listens to Merlin the most out of anyone, even with his uncle. The second thing, and this to me was the most showing, was the end scene with Merlin and Arthur as the prince pondered over his love for Gwen. Arthur was so vulnerable there, and hadn't even bothered to hide this in front of Merlin. He was a completely open book, and was helpless. He turned to Merlin and clearly asked ""what should I do."" For me that means a great deal, as Arthur has never shown weakness like that to anyone, except for Merlin. He flat out asked Merlin what he should do. His servant. It's hard not to see a strong relationship from that.

I did not like the threats for banishment either, but I do believe that Arthur was in a state of emotional turmoil. I don't think he could've actually been able to go through with it.

Honestly I would love to change course and become an illustrator, but unsure how. Working on a side project in making my own comic and seeing how it goes, as I am getting a bit weary of fashion.

you have to *really* research an art college/degree to see if they benefit you, and I am a bit snobbish in that doing an art degree in a place that is famed for medical degrees (like UCL or Southampton) seems a big waste of time to me.

Whatever you pick, art schools/degrees usually end up in two ways, to be honest. One way is that there's a very strong teaching presence, and someone can look at your degree portfolio and say ""ahh, you went to _____. I can tell by your work."" This is actually really common in art degrees everywhere, and your work ends up being very similar to that of your classmates, as there's a house style that everyone adopts. HOWEVER, these colleges usually are practical and teach a great deal of common sense and actual physical technique also, be it printing or photoshop or whatever.

The other type of college has a far looser hand on teaching (here is a project, I'll see you occasionally, now fuck off and do and I'll see you for the critique) and you're expected to develop your own style. Usually these colleges are quite reputable and hard to get into, but the bad thing is they teach absolutely nothing in terms of real life skills and how the industry works. People who graduate from one of these are usually left with no clue how things work or even how to apply for work, but do have a nice bit of paper saying they went to _____ school of art.

My way of viewing it was that the cycling was mostly just a way of giving people something to do, and they carry on because they're given reward in the form of entertainment. They know that other people have it better than them, but it's been set up so that all the entertainers came from the same starting position as them.

The society we live in is obviously nothing like what we see in the show, but a lot of people at the lower end of the economic spectrum do earn little money in unchallenging jobs when most are undoubtedly capable of doing more but have little opportunity to do so.

Reality TV shows and celebrity life in culture is a little like the lottery - it doesn't obey class boundaries and often the ones who make it do so more through luck and looks than through talent. Lots of people feel this way, but can't really do much about it - especially when so many others don't mind the situation they're in.

Brooker's career has been a bit like the arc Bing followed - he started off ranting and complaining about how television both exploits and mollifies us - but enough people found his criticism entertaining that he's been absorbed by the industry and now enjoys the benefits that come with it.

If we're talking about specific people, I know she's too famous now to be cast in Doctor Who, but Hellen Bonham Carter would shine as a lady Doctor. I would choose her even if I didn't have this ridiculous girl-crush on her and her acting. xD

Some around here might dispute any claim I'd make to 'intelligence', but I'll have a crack at it.

I've been trying to find a copy of the full text, but short of a subscription to the New Statesman, will just have to settle for the quotes in this article.

The first quote targets MP's, and the second is ambiguous to if it refers to MP's or the public in general, so I'll tackle both parties separately.

Putting to one side for a moment the slightly condescending implication that intelligent and educated people out-grow religion, I'd argue the beliefs of the individual MP's are mostly irrelevant. *As* MP's their role is to represent and respect the range of views of their constituents (even if its not a majority view), not tell them what's good for them.

As for the general public presuming that religious faith is 'good for other people', well in terms of faith schools they certainly seem popular amongst agnostic families in terms of educational and behavioural standards, to the extent where people will pretend to be religious to get their kids in.

And on a side note, why is it so wrong to defend a parents right to raise their kids in line with their own culture and/or beliefs?

I never really had an opinion of Banksy one way or the other, and I still don't have one after watching the documentary on Channel 4, (graffiti isn't really my cup of tea, but I can appreciate a good piece of art when I see it) but watching the program did make me appreciate his work a bit less afterwards.

Also, maybe he was trying to portray that the powers Seth gets are usually useless, as they are the ones that people don't want. After all, it's not like the healing chick in season two was about to give away her power. Maybe now that they have some rapport with Seth he will allow them to get better, more powerful ones in the next episode.

But the way in which those people lived made me feel pretty uncomfortable; the lack of any outdoors, performing basic tasks, being forced to ""resume viewing"". I know this is meant to reflect on our world, and perhaps be some sort of alternate reality, but I feel like ordinary people would find a lot of this unacceptable.""

As far as the storyline is concerned, for all we know these people never knew the outside. The world we watched in this episode could be the world they know.  This point hit me when the audience was made of avatars and not people.  Another theory for me anyway is that the three judges weren't there.. they could have been holograms.  We notice at the very end how it is revealed that higher res renderings exist when the main character looked out into his ""free world"".

Anyway, I really enjoyed this episode and hopefully you get a chance to re-view it someday and recall some things I just typed out.

true,Julian1986,null,null,"I read the article and thought it was the typical banker bashing - then the author got on my nerves!

The writer mentions the importance to our coffers of tax but misses out income tax that employees will be paying.  One criticism of the investment banks are the salaries; plugging simple estimates in about the industry and my results suggest this was omitted either out of naive clumsiness or to massage data into information to make his case.  The widget maker in the Midlands maybe on £20,000, when the investment banker is on £80,000.  I am not sure the reliability of this link but it matches my expectations of values:

http://www.kleinwortbenson.com/content/1030/bankingsectorcontributesoveratenthofuktaxstudyreveals  

Ignoring misleading figures, my confusion spreads to his argument that the sector is not the biggest sector and that it is inefficient so should not be protected.  If I remember industry is about 13% GDP and banking 10% in this country.   Policy decisions could remove clearing houses and brokers from London - this alone would throw us back into gloom and recession, whereas currently we are just in gloom expecting recession.  

In regards to inefficiency I am not sure his reasoning that anyone involved in mortgages caused the bubble.  Prices go up and down over long cycles and people give loans out to buy houses.  That is business as usual for building societies and retail banks.  It sounds a bit fatalist but any economist who has decided to tame recessions ends up looking stupid (and often with a worse recession to boot),

So our banking sector has been misrepresented as not contributing tax, jobs (only 1.5 million and not 2 million jobs!) and costing us lots of money (RBS has lost us half the value he states) through cronyism and being related to our ruling class.  This did not bother me at all.  

Now then onto when he got on my nerves.  His major short coming was in his presentation of data as information.  What really annoyed me was when he called it statistics.  Statistics in the political sphere has come to mean random titbits of data presenting in a convincing and serious manner to make people believe you.  Sadly I feel that is where this article resides.  I know journalists work on a deadline and it is better to spin things and google selectively but I expect more from the guardian.

I've not done anything, and I won't... however, I'm 100% certain I'm right.  He could have found out everything he was given by ""the best lead"" by searching M_tt, Wi_dows, T_uro which is all I did.  Every lead he was given he asked someone else to message them, giving a nonsensical reason why he couldn't.    
  
When he came back on line after ""a night's sleep"" he ONLY answered the replies, over enthusiastically, that gave out little hope.  He did not even acknowledge the replies which were obviously getting very close to finding his ""friend"".  He only began to do so when I messaged him asking why.  His rather cringeworthy Uriah Heepness grew exponentially as people began to doubt him after his ludicrous comments about ""The Window Company"", and with it his suddenly halting and vulnerable sounding command of the English language.  Compare early posts to last posts.   
  
 A guy who is a full on gamer, knows how to tether his phone yet can't get on Facebook, can't do a standard search on the Google taking a couple of minutes, preferring to type an essay to Reddit and loves to play the victim.  A guy who said he would delete the thread to safeguard his ""friend"" yet still hasn't done so.  He talks about being on line, exhausted all day, his suddenly broken English clearly a symptom of this *cough*.  He was on there around 3 hours tops, after his 9 hour ""sleep"".    
  
It has been suggested he's a competitor of the ""Window Company"".  I'm more inclined to believe he's just unbalanced and seeking attention/likes to play the martyr/victim.  It's because I really believe he is unbalanced that I'm not going to set the *""Cornish mafia""* on him.  My uncle lives near Truro in a place called Lanner and is actually a window fitter, and has been so for 30 years.  He would know the people involved.

It's hard for Americans to wrap our heads around persecution between Protestants and Catholics. To us, they're practically the same thing. It's disconcerting at first for us to see two white, Christian populations involved in a conflict we're used to associating with much more disparate ideologies. And then of course was the shift from viewing it as a religious conflict to realizing it's about land and identity, and religion is just a part of identity in Northern Ireland.
Art breaks through cultural barriers much more quickly than trying to explain does. I can see the need  to move on from the ugly message that went along with it though. It would have been really cool to take a picture of the mural as it was, then paint over it with a mural representing a more contemporary (and perhaps more inspiring?) viewpoint.

It's amazing how he's one of our best players on the attacking end of the counter attack and breaking up counter attacks too. His surging runs are awesome. I love see him get the ball with three players around him, but since they are more than two feet away, by the time they turn to even look at him he's gone. The best part is his runs and his vision after receiving the ball just keep getting better! On top of that he wins like practically every single 50/50 ball.

Part of the joke and the challenge of Misfits 1 and 2 is that for most of them (except Alicia), their super powers are pretty fookin super. The limiting factor, in all cases, are their own personalities.

Now that the characters have shown heroism and compassion and valor and selflessness... their powers are craptastic.

Boy that sounds strange. 

Yeah, Lamps looks and sounds pissed. I'd expect nothing else from him, it's completely new to him and he expects to play. In contrast Ferreira is fine with his squad role and we don't expect him to be a world class right back. We need big games from Lamps and we need him to be pissed off when he doesn't play. Look at the ferocity of his penalty, that's exactly the fighting spirit we need in him.

I also think his evasion of answering the question regarding transfer policy implies that we will be buying a new striker.

true,bluesandtwos,null,null,"Whilst I see what you're trying to put across I do have a few points. Firstly there is such a thing as any person power of arrest. Section 24a of PACE means that anyone can arrest for an indictable offence. A constable may arrest for indictable and summary (generally lesser) offences under section 24 of PACE. As a citizen you may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances to effect or assist in that arrest under section 3 of the criminal law act. Those bits of law are commonly used by loss prevention teams at big shops. In regard to hitting someone with a baton, it is an offensive weapon and requires reasonable excuse or lawful authority to be carried in public. Police officers, Military, UKBA officers, HMP prison officers (who whilst acting as such have full powers and privileges of a constable) and oddly water bailiffs have lawful authority to carry one. Most members of the public do not. However if someone broke into your home and you hit them with your cricket bat in self defence and could show that you used no more force than is reasonable, that is lawful. There are a lot of other similar examples.  You need not be arresting anyone, and nor the police officer. The common law holds you have a right to self defence and that includes the right to strike first. The differences in use of force law between police and public are not very different. Where they do differ is in places the public would not need those powers. ",0,1323754250,null,0,false,0,c37l74d,t3_n8euk,t1_c37l74d,t1_c372th9,1428013541,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I don't think its entirely fair that he was subjected to that kind of scrutiny, but I definitely resent him for leaving all the same.  That being said, I'd still have him back.  If he carried himself properly  I think he could pretty easily win back all his old fans as well (as long as he starts putting the ball in the net of course).  In a lot of ways he's kind of the missing piece to our puzzle right now.  He really is a pretty big, powerful forward but he plays with a lot more finesse and would fit so much better into our style of play than someone like Carroll does.  I mean really, think about it. Suarez and Torres up top? Suarez has such good movement off the ball, he would be opening up holes all over the place that Torres actually has the skill/speed to exploit.

Though I'll tell you something. I started the black and white stuff 6 months ago and treated it like an education experiment. 6 months later, a couple weeks ago, I go back and watch a story I never cared for. I liked it a lot more- the emotions and nuances of the story I never noticed before stood out to me.

Older tv isn't as dramatic with the music, the camera direction, and such. The stories hardly focus on the companions, but once you get used to this more subtle form of tv and you learn to adapt to the pacing, it's fantastic.

The only things that truly will be trying and understandable off-putting are the black and white days, and especially the reconstructions. There's nothing wrong with black and white, and Troughton and Hartnell are fantastic, but the pacing was at its slowest then and the camera direction was practically nonexistent.

Later you'll find yourself playing for Newcastle, while still recovering from a series of injuries that has all the experts of western medicine who knows how a knee is supposed to be pieced together shaking their head, and sometimes throwing up a bit whenever you injure yourself during national team duties. And in the end, you find yourself as a sometimes substitute on a pay-as-you-play contract, where the only matches you start are in the League Cup.

It isn't a great article, but that's because its a science article in mainstream news which means it ends up dumbed down and gets very few ""column"" inches. 

&gt; it's probably why places like Scandinavia have such low crime rates. If you're ignoring every murder, assault, and rape committed by people under 15 things suddenly look a lot better.

They don't ignore the crime they just don't prosecute a child for it. The crimes still get reported and recorded. The same actually happens here when a kid does commits a crime under the age of 10 or no-one gets caught or prosecuted for a crime. The real reason they have lower rates of crime is because more people of a reasonable standard of wealth; which is the strongest correlating factor between crime, health issues and lots of other things.

The reason the age was lowered from, 15 I believe, under labour was based on some dubious anecdotes about gangs using children to commit unspeakable acts, the idea was that this would cut crime rate (crime rates did go down under labour, but I don't know if you can attribute it to this, other laws that they introduced or just the relative increase in prosperity that happened between the mid 1990s and mid 2000s). There are still child services, there are still councillors and psychiatrists that can help these kids that have clearly been taken advantage of and possibly been abused, I doubt giving them a criminal record does much when they don't even understand its implications. It was more about policing and the concept of discipline.

The whole idea that a lack of discipline is the main reason for someone becoming a criminal or why a child has a lack of *personal* discipline seems to rest on logical assumptions that I'm not sure make sense. I, for one, spent most of my childhood without being disciplined (I think I got a few detentions at school for talking in class and not doing my homework) and I've never committed a crime; the kids at my school that are now criminals were absolutely disciplined, had to spend hours doing stuff like cleaning the playground, writing notes of apology etc. Furthermore, when kids were beaten at school that didn't stop crime, just like the death penalty didn't *prevent* murder.

The solution to raising a child without issue seems to be a stable income home, strong and respected communication between parents/guardians and children and levels responsibility given at the right ages. The gaps in between are for parents, teachers and child behavioural experts to fill. I'm not saying no discipline (and I'm really, in no way qualified to do so), but the aim of a punishment has to be clear, it can't be revenge or to teach them that ""actions have consequences"" it has to be so they understand what they did is wrong.",0,1323767521,null,0,false,0,c37mgf1,t3_narng,t1_c37mgf1,t1_c37m7xh,1428014217,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

I get shunned for my choice of words quite often here where as friends I have from England and Sweeden see no issue with how speak. It was just how I was raised. I feel much more comfortable being able to talk freely and not get eyeballed like a spazz.

I do also have important personal issues that are compelling me to leave the USA, but I cannot express them here. I only wish to know how much of my knowledge is skewed before I go.

I have become a lot more sensitive to these sorts of things since moving to Iceland and have been assimilated into their general attitude towards women. I visited the UK last year and met an old friend. He had a copy of Nuts. I flicked through it and was genuinely shocked at some of the language in there, it's just something we don't have here in Iceland.

My view is that the USA seemed more tense politically and socially, you couldn't find debate, on tv or in a bar, it tended to just be an argument, with the winner the one who didn't back down. We have our share of nutcases and problems, now granted I don't live in London, that place is 10x more extreme, but it's just more laid back. Also cars. You don't need them in a city, and you don't get looked down upon if you don't have one, that was a peeve.

Things to know (largely useless ones), coffee shops shut pathetically early, infact everything shuts pathetically early, going out for a meal is more expensive, but less chain-orientated, servers don't rely on tips, so ratchet down the tip to 10% and you're still generous, oh, somehow we've managed to take the saturated fat out of the air here, I swear you lose 5lb just by staying here a month.

This particular film is an annual tradition; sadly last year's was canceled due to snow-in but this time the weather is set to be good enough to allow both the volunteers to set up and the viewers (i.e. you!) to come :3

If you've never seen or heard of this film, here's a blurb:

&gt; George Bailey (James Stewart) has devoted his life to helping the people of Bedford Falls, struggling to keep the wealthy skinflint businessman Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) from taking over the town. When his family building and loan business is compromised, George’s reputation and spirit are so crushed that he considers a drastic solution. A gentle apprentice angel named Clarence, however, has other ideas. 

If you're not a facebooker, here are the details (note that you do NOT need to reserve or join the facebook event to attend):

* Doors open at 18:30, film is from 19:00 to 21:00!
* Full address is: [St James Church, Church Street, New Bradwell, Milton Keynes, MK13 5LG](http://g.co/maps/7ydfs)
* Tickets are £6 normal / £4 concession (student, OAP, etc), however you can buy 10 for the price of 8
* Purchasable at the door or can be reserved from Boutique 73 in Wolverton or by emailing ursywhite@hotmail.co.uk
* Mulled wine, mince pies and other refreshments will be available on the cheap!

Be sure to book, as this film sells out quite quickly! Angel wings are encouraged :3

Oh, and **one more thing:** If you'd like to volunteer for this film or for us in general, great! We're a real friendly team of volunteers who get a good work out sorting all the film equipment out.

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"&gt; Firstly, we're not choosing some random innocent bystander to pick on; this is making fun of a bully.    

We have no idea how this incident got started. While I won't abide by this women's language or how she chooses to carry herself, I won't make judgements based on a YouTube video which starts half way through the conflict.    

&gt; Secondly, as has been pointed out, homosexuality, race, and gender are -- by any objective definition -- innate and not something that can be changed whereas for &gt;99% of overweight people, being overweight is a choice.     

So just to be clear if it turned out that homosexuality was a choice (as a lot of people feel it is) you would be against it? But as long as it remains natural/genetic you support it?    

I just ask because that is where your logic takes us. If you only support things which aren't a choice, and you feel you have the right to insult others based on their ""choices"" then by extension anything which I can suggest is a choice you're against.   

&gt; Thirdly, this woman most likely doesn't have ""a [medical] issue with food""    

Not an issue I brought up. You aren't quoting me. My position is that nobody should be attacked for the way they live their lives, in particular when those things are linked to addiction and or quasi-mental illness (e.g. depression).    

But since you're getting into the tired argument about overweight people and smokers costing society more, let me remind you that that is in fact untrue. Factually speaking because the overweight and smokers die younger their total healthcare bill is lower, on average, than ""healthy"" people who live long enough to need long term care/cancer treatment/etc.    

My position is more broad than defending this women. Frankly I couldn't give two tiny shits about her. The issue is one that people feel like it is ok to attack others for their lifestyle while in the same breath condemning them for racism. These two things are contradictory. Being racist is just as unreasonable as going after someone for their weight, smoking, drinking, or any other addiction. No matter how you want to justify it it all boils down to bullying people so you can feel better about yourself.

True, which is why I have otherwise paid no interest in this story other than this philosophical debate. I would personally choose to wait until greater context has been provided so as to form a considered opinion. However, within the context provided, the woman is clearly the aggressor. My points are based on this assumption; if she transpires to be a victim who is unable to form a constructive defence and makes bad decisions as a consequence, my argument would not hold (as elaborated upon below).

&gt; So just to be clear if it turned out that homosexuality was a choice **(as a lot of people feel it is)** you would be against it? But as long as it remains natural/genetic you support it?

(emphasis mine)

The statement highlighted is an obvious attempt to liken me/us to the irrational homophobes who disregard the plethora of evidence that shows homosexuality to be innate. However, if somehow homosexuality were found to be by choice, it would still have to be somehow harmful to the rest of society before it would be worthy of derision amongst people who otherwise deserved it.

&gt; I just ask because that is where your logic takes us

No, that's where a highly-reactionary misreading of a subset of my ""logic"" takes us. To clarify, based on my previous comment, the aspect would only be worthy of belittlement if

1) It was highly likely (&gt;99%) a result of choice and

2) The individual who is being insulted is themselves the aggresor and worthy of belittlement and

3) The aspect being attacked must be in someway detrimental to others/society.

&gt; smokers costing society more

I never said they did.

&gt; Factually speaking because the overweight ... die younger their total healthcare bill is lower, on average, than ""healthy"" people who live long enough to need long term care/cancer treatment/etc.

1) Additional cost to society is just one aspect of the inconvenience it causes.

2) This is not born out by the evidence: http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/v16/n8/full/oby2008290a.html In particular, see [table 2](http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/v16/n8/fig_tab/oby2008290t2.html#figure-title).

&gt;  Frankly I couldn't give two tiny shits about her. The issue is one that people feel like it is ok to attack others for their lifestyle while in the same breath condemning them for racism. These two things are contradictory.

These two are completely different for two reasons:

1) Belittling an aggressor/bully helps to reinforce society's opinion that bullies/aggressors are ""bad"" and undesirable.

2) Belittling someone for something beyond their control is irrational and pointless, serving only to divide society. Belittling someone for something they can control, and shows that the individual is taking avoidable, detrimental actions and is not a good role-model.

&gt; No matter how you want to justify it it all boils down to bullying people so you can feel better about yourself.

No, it boils down to mocking bullies for making bad decisions.",0,1323777499,null,0,false,0,c37mzmi,t3_n9zvi,t1_c37mzmi,t1_c37mvdo,1428014470,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

My main problem with high streets ( and I see this up and down the country as I tour a lot ) is that they're all carbon copies of one another; you've got WH Smiths, Primark, Claire's accessories, Waterstones, Clinton Cards, Greggs, Tesco Metro etc. etc. all chains that have moved in and pushed up the rates knocking out the traditional smaller business such as Butchers, Greengrocers, fishmongers, family bakers etc. 

The all-in-one supermarkets don't help either. 

I mean I'm lucky, where I live in London we've campaigned against the chains so I still have a decent place to shop and I can avoid those horrid cathedrals of capitalism we call supermarkets and malls. Obviously I can go ten minutes down the road and find that shit, but I have a choice.  Many small towns haven't had that though, they've just been overrun so they're stuck with it.  

I will add that supermarkets are not cheap either, they just appear to be cheap, it's a great illusion. My weeks worth of vegetables from the local greengrocers costs triple that from the Sainsbury's down the road, believe me, the girl and I have done the sums. It's mainly because it's all pre-packeged i.e. you have to buy an amount they tell you to buy resulting in an expensive amount of pointless waste. The stuff they sell tastes like crap too.

The fatigue is  waking up after a day of doing very little and struggling to do anything at all. The memory problems, often referred to as 'brain fog', are basically problems with short-term memory. You know when a word is on the top of your tongue? A bit like a severe version of that when trying to think. Sorry if the descriptions aren't great.

Before I fell ill I lived in upper-middle class suburbia with no real problems in life. Had a decent group of friends, a girlfriend, found school easy etc. The first things I noticed were problems playing a full 80 minutes of football and coming in from school everyday and needing a nap. That's when I started going to the doctors which eventually lead to seeing a specialist. It took about 10 months to be diagnosed and by the end of that time I was longer able to go to school. 

I managed to bluff my way through my GCSE's after missing a full year of school then tried my best to go on and do A-levels but I just couldn't cope with it. Now I'm not doing much living with my parents and I'm on incapacity benefits. I live a pretty shit life now doing very little. 

I am 99% sure it is caused by something physical although I have nothing but my life experiences as to why I think that is. The illness does leave you very vulnerable to psychological problems though.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;You don't think the way they have imploded the economy, needed trillions in government support, and brought on a worldwide double-dip recession should be counted against them?

The UK has spent 124 Billion of money on buying shares in banks, or providing them with loans which they have to pay back, to date as of Oct 2011.

There was a systemic problem in the early and mid 2000's with deregulation of the US sub-prime mortgage industry and bad behaviour by both the general public and the mortgage brokers, along with complicity from several but nowhere near all US banks. This lead to the 2008 recession.

The current crisis which exists is partly leftovers from the 2008 crisis which created serious liquidity problems over the world, and the sovereign debt crisis which, again while having been facilitated by or two dodgy actors (out of hundreds of thousands), is ultimately something which has been perpetrated by politicians acting unwisely for decades, brought to a head by the financial crisis and some unfortunate timing of various political events.

Now I have given you reasons that the UK financial sector should suffer very little of the blame for this current crisis. Unless you can give me reasons against what I have said you should stop saying what you have said, because not only is it wrong, but it encourages the legitimacy of this self-destruction of a 10th of our economy that so many fools are chasing.

&gt;Your points about the benefits are true. However, that doesn't mean we can't take a close look at how badly the banks fucked things things up in 2008, and think about possible improvements to the way they operate.

As has been said ""The banks"" is an excessively flawwed term. If you want to talk about the recession the largest possible unit you can look at is banks on a national scale (if looking at regulation). Otherwise you need to talk about specific banks, not just all of them together worldwide.

&gt;It's not ""defending British sovereignty"" to keep letting the banks do whatever they want.

I don't believe I ever said it was. I also don't particularly agree with the way this whole EU treaty thing has gone down with Britain just walking away from the table. That said, the banks are not doing ""whatever they want"", they are acting within a set of regulations which, frankly, seem to broadly work. Is it probably worth tweaking things a bit, putting in some safeguards in areas which have been exposed as a little too weak? Sure, that's a gradual process which happens all the time anyway.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;They created overly-complex instruments that they didn't understand, and then spread them all through the financial system.

They? Who is they? There were plenty of US banks which stayed the hell away from the subprime crisis because they knew it was looking dodgy. As for, say, Nordea of Sweden, or Banco de la Nación of Peru, or many of the other innumerable banks I could list for you, they were not involved. So I ask again, who is ""they""?

&gt;There was insufficient resilience in the system they created, so when these things starting blowing up, the whole thing came crashing down.

Well of course, thanks Captain Hindsight! That's just an issue of choice. Do you want a financial system which earns money or not, and how much do you balance the ability to leverage, which effectively limits the amount a bank can earn. It's all too easy to say that banks must have been over leveraged because things went wrong, but then again the rise of world GDP in the last 100 or so years has been inexorable despite two major world depressions and dozens of smaller ones. The global financial industry has contributed to this greatly, and the oft promoted idea that banks shouldn't leverage at all, as much as it appeals to those who would love to never have a financial crash again, would also retard our economic progress greatly.

If you start in year 0 with 10 apples per year, and you can either choose, for examples sake, a 10% increase on that per year with a 20% decrease every decade on average but delivered randomly, or a 5% increase on that per year with no decreases ever, which do you choose? The former is going to hurt more, but when that 20% kicks in every decade the people who go with the former system are still at a better stage overall than the people who go with the latter system.

&gt;I hesitate to point the finger at individuals, it seems to me the problems were systemic, not with particular banks but rather a failing of the whole system.

This systemic problem is that banks can fail. It is basically impossible to reduce the probability of this to 0 without doing away with the way the modern financial markets work, all we can really talk about is degrees of probability. So do we want 15% increase with 40% drops every decade on average, or 10% with 20% drops? But that's just a quantitative issue, not a qualitative one.",0,1323781948,null,0,true,0,c37n9w9,t3_na6ab,t1_c37n9w9,t1_c37mtrk,1428014598,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

What other half? I don't care for opinion. Snipes aside, if you can't see that trying to arrest a photographer under the Terrorism Act is misuse of police power, there is no hope for you.

Just two examples of me saying that the police in this case were wrong. You might consider the fact that charges would go nowhere inconcequential, but the CPS disagree.

&gt;if you can't see that trying to arrest a photographer under the Terrorism Act is misuse of police power

Er, I have no idea what I've said that gave you that impression, shall we try again?

&gt;they were wrong



&gt;an irrelevant sideshow to my original post.

Your original post was about how taking a cash settlement wasnt enough (fuck settlements), and saying that  the officers should be criminally charged instead. My point is that charges would never have gotten anywhere, and so would not be brought by CPS - instead taking the settlement was the right thing to do, it would be a case of one of the other - if you attempted to persue criminal action against them then no settlement would have been offered.",0,1323783788,null,0,true,0,c37nf04,t3_na5la,t1_c37nf04,t1_c37neap,1428014651,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1
