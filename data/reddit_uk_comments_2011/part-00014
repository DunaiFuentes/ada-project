There are 3 completely separate issues about the census:

* There is a fine for not filling it out. Ridiculous, but I doubt it will be enforced anyway.
* The data is processed in the US, where the privacy rules are less strict. Silly to protest about if you have any popular social network account, a GMail account, or have ever posted the same data with your full name on the internet.

London generates a hell of a lot more money than any other part of the country - it most definitely does not rely on subsidies from other cities in the UK! London, contributes 20% of the GDP of the UK, and 30% if you count Greater London. 

[PWC state that London has the highest 'city GDP' of any city in Europe.](http://www.ukmediacentre.pwc.com/Media-Library/Global-city-GDP-rankings-2008-2025-61a.aspx)

More damning to your argument, though, is that the GDP per capita of London is a bit over â¬44,000 - with the average of the country being only â¬26,000. Central London trumps yet again (The City, being the main reason) at â¬71,000. ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_England)).

true,BonzoTheBoss,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"I appreciate how you might interpret the situation that way, however I would like to draw your attention to some differences between this ""revolution"" and those that occured in Egypt and Tunisia. The crux in both of those countries was the military. When push came to shove the military refused to fire on its own people, as I stated in another reply:

&gt;In Tunisia and Egypt both times the national army refused to turn against its own people, which effectively solidified the revolutions. In Libya it's completely different, primarily because Libya doesn't have an effective national army, Gaddafi purposely kept them weak fearing a military coup (citation [here](http://www.npr.org/2011/03/10/134404618/gadhafis-military-muscle-concentrated-in-elite-units)). Instead he's using elite troops loyal (possibly actively indoctrinated) only to him, and hired mercenaries from Africa, both of whom have no problem gunning down Libyan civilians.

That is why we did not intervene in Egypt Or Tunisia, and in Yemen a top military general has [backed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12804552) the uprising there so there is still a chance the military will defect and install democracy there (i.e. we don't need to intervene yet). Gaddafi made no secret of the fact he intended to wipe out the people opposed to [his](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12790942) rule (scroll down, it cites he says there will be ""no mercy""...).

As international relations are extremely complex, and thus (as much as we would like) cannot always be black and white. Truth is the US probably won't intervene in Bahrain (at least not until Libya has been resolved) because their 5th naval fleet is [based](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/17/bahrain-protests-us-fifth-fleet) there. As for Syria I haven't done as much research but in all honesty I think it's more an issue of popular opinion and resources. The majority of media coverage is focused on Libya which affects public opinion. I'm not saying it's right but politicians will only act when they feel the people will support it. At the moment (as bad as it is) the situation in Syria hasn't escalated to a full on armed assault on the people by the states military (yes protestors have died, but it hasn't turned into a full scale armed uprising like in Libya). So ultimately the respective governments won't expend expensive military resources intervening in more than as many countries as they can. (e.g. each [cruise](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12806709) missile costs Â£500,000...)

I think it's unfair to compare Obama and Cameron to Gaddafi. I haven't seen any mercenaries gunning down civilians in my neighbourhood anyway! I agree they won't always act for purely ""humanitarian"" reasons, indeed you need to consider the fact that they need to act in the best interests of the nation as a whole, which doesn't always mean playing nice (e.g. selling weapons to dictators, but the proceeds may pay for healthcare, schools etc?). That said, even if there are ulterior motives (i.e. oil) in intervening in Libya, it was still the right thing to do. And if it was exclusively about oil and profit; like I said above surely it would have been more logical from a purely ""business"" respect to let Gaddafi slaughter his people and resume normal operations asap?

I'd agree with the lobbyist point but we'd need a very large sum of money in order to lobby successfully, something that multinationals have access to but we as individuals don't. There was a 38 Degrees idea not so long ago that we all club together to lobby politicians. A middle ground would be a more transparent lobbying process, something that is being campaigned for already (see www.spinwatch.org).

The point of protesting is it raises awareness. MPs (often to their chagrin) also have a responsibility to their constituents and will sometimes even soften or change policy to get the votes of the people they represent. The police who are actually going to be on the frontline at this protest might be more sympathetic now they've realised that their jobs are in jeopardy as well.

Obviously this can't be the case when party policy is enforced by the party whips (see Iraq). Perhaps voting reform here would allow a bit more competition in the form of independent candidates, and stop the 'say anything near election time to get votes then default back to the big evil plan' strategy.

true,2009dc,null,null,"France, with Britain taking a similar position, called for war early on. But only once it was clear that Gaddafi was not going to quickly crush the protests, and that a strong rebel position had been established in Benghazi. Had Gaddafi been able to put down the opposition in the early stages of the internal strife, I have no doubt that Paris, London, Rome and Washington would be working with him today - as they had been doing for years before.

Paris openly supported the rebel factions based in Benghazi while the opposition forces were in the ascendency against Gaddafi's forces, a de facto declaration of war against Libya. At this point, an open military conflict between France and Libya became a near certainty. It was only a matter of what combination of forces would back the war and who would oppose it.

The French government saw an opportunity to take the lead in Libya through backing the rebels at a point when they were gaining ground and it appeared Gaddafi might fall. This would have allowed Paris to make up some of authority it lost in North Africa after the fall of Ben Ali and Mubarak - two of France's closest allies in the region. Being the main sponsor, with Britain, of a new regime based on the ex-Gaddafi figures in Benghazi would have been a major geopolitical coup for Paris and London.

Gaddafi only started winning the conflict with the eastern-based rebel forces when the latter made utterly reckless and ill-prepared marches on Gaddafi's strongholds. Columns of rebel forces, without any real military hardware to support them, attempted to take towns still held by the government and were decimated by the Libyan armed forces.

The rebels launched this offense after France, backed by the UK (and in all likelihood receiving covert assistance from the United States), recognized the Benghazi leadership as the new government of Libya and offered them full support. I think it is reasonable to speculate that the Western powers encouraged the unprepared offense by rebel forces. When, as could easily have been predicted, the Libyan army crushed the rebel advance and launched a counterattack, the major powers, again led by France and Britain, used this as a justification for military intervention.

The die was cast as soon as France announced its support for the rebel leadership in Benghazi. There was no way that Britain or the US was going to stand by while Paris reshaped Libya in its interests. London quickly adopted a position very close to that of France; but Washington prevaricated, uncertain of whether to unseat Gaddafi or let his forces push back against the rebels. Ultimately, Washington had to intervene because it could not tolerate an Anglo-French campaign in Libya that would have left US interests out in the cold. US imperialism has not permitted Paris and London an independent role in the region since the 1956 Suez Crisis - and Washington wasn't going to let them take the lead now.

As for lobbying, you don't need a large amount of money to lobby parliament. You just need to identify the Select Comities and All Party Groups and constantly engage with them. If you need money, then raise donations from the public, but you certainly don't need millions, especially as most people now have access to computers and the internet.

I know protesting is about raising awareness, but honestly that is just the first part of the process, and the majority of people who protest will stop there having done their bit. Awareness in itself is pointless, especially when we have loads of people trying to raise awareness about everything from unsanitary drinking water in Africa to the latest gadget they are trying to shift. People just tune it out or whatever the last thing that they saw becomes important. A million people marching on whitehall doesn't scare MP's, because frankly they don't know those people and have no connection to them. People protesting individual MP's might have more impact, as the MP will know that the people outside their door are the people who will or won't vote for them.

As for the link, I got you and Haywire mixed up, and for that I apologize. But given that, I do have to note that the edge of violent confrontation that seems to be creeping into this march/movement is worrying. The second you have someone on TV heaving a brick/paintbomb/smoke grenade at a cop, the easier it is for the powers that be to go ""well obviously these people are violent extremists, and we don't want our political discourse dominated by extremists"", the Daily Mail will run a shitty editorial on the protest and your instantly relegated to non-importance.

As for manufacturing, automation isn't entirely ubiquitous just yet, it will be in the future but for the next generation at least we'll still need people to make stuff. There is plenty of room for sector growth, probably not the mass market crap but definitely high end stuff and handmade/bespoke stuff.

While I broadly agree I would take issue with the reliance you place on the finance sector, if all we do is tax them more then it is likely that they will leave, and until we have refocused our economy significantly we are still reliant on them for a very large amount of our tax receipts.

true,kank84,canada,Expat,"To a certain extent family members can already take over a claim in some situations, but only for the benefit of the claimant (i.e. a parent acting for a child, a guardian acting for a person who does not have capacity, an estate acting for the deceased).  The sort of situation they are mooting here is some sort of nightmarish free market on who can pursue a claim and retain the benefit.

A prime example would be the market for personal injury claims.  These types of claims are already a commodity to a number of parties.  Claims' farmers and before the event insurers regularly ""refer"" (read ""sell on"") claims that they have taken the details for to a solicitor for anywhere between Â£300 and Â£900.  The solicitors then act on a contingency basis until proceedings are issued, and then utilise the BTE insurance, or set up separate after the event insurance to cover the other side's costs.  The solicitor will, at the conclusion of their claim, recover their costs and an uplift of anything up to 100% of their costs again (this uplift depends on how risky the claim is, and rewards solicitors for not just taking the sure win).  It is not unusual for a solicitor to make Â£20,000 from a claim that's worth Â£5000, so you can see why it's worth paying Â£900 to get their hands on it.

The sort of scenario that would be created if the case in the article is allowed is even worse than what already exists.  The claims' farmers will stop just selling claims onto firms of solicitors, they will start offering money to purchase the rights to your claim.  Fallen down and hurt yourself? Can't be bothered with the hassle of medical reports, statements, potentially having to go to court, and possibly having to wait years for your compensation? We'll give you Â£500 right now and take your claim off your hands.  The company would then instruct a solicitor to act on their behalf, as the legal owner of the rights to this claim, and they would keep all the compensation at the end.  The company wouldn't need to pay legal fees because the solicitors would still act on a CFA, and companies, local authorities, councils etc get hammered with loads of claims, for which the benefit is going to this enhanced claim farming company.

In fairness the scenario above does rely upon the current scheme for costs in pi cases, and this is currently under review and likely to change at somepoint in the future, but never the less this could easily spiral into something terrible.

Compared to other nations where education is free if you have good enough grades to get accepted, and they offer scholarships to work in research there in the summers, etc.

With university education, I think it's something we should look into. There is a chance we will reduce the amount of EU students coming here, especially at the low end of the scale (such as Derby university, which I attended), but at the top end we can offer high end education that consistently has more people applying than can get in. And it does have the unintended consequence of possibly encouraging more British students to study aboard in the EU, which I think will help to curtail some europhobia going forward. I still think we should have just called the new university tuition repayment scheme a tax rather than the complicated loans system we ended up with. I would agree largely that access to higher academic and technical education needs further examination, however I would disagree that the new scheme is as bad as has been made out.

I appreciate that we might be able to get some return, but I am skeptical on how worthwhile it really is for tackling unemployment and helping normal people.

At the most basic level, having more of our economy geared towards exporting will generate more cash we can use to invest in social programs. This has been a problem for some time, we import to much. Even automation would provide a similar revenue stream at the expense of jobs. But unfortunately we're in the no-mans land between no automation and full automation. But for the moment, an economy with more manufacturing in it will provide more jobs and revenue, both of which we need.

&gt; I agree we shouldn't tax them hugely and cause an exodus of capital, but I do think there needs to be an evolutionary process to restore reliability and security to the sector, perhaps with the government heading a consumer co-operative bank and providing secured, reliable funds for stringent mortgages, business loans etc. while investment banking can still be a private matter. We shouldn't make the same mistake of leaving such a critical part of the economy (and the country) in the hands of short-term profiteers again.

I think that we should focus on this in stages, firstly a pan-European separation of retail and investment banking (doing it in the UK alone wouldn't work), then we could examine the idea of re-tooling the parts of Northern Rock and RBS left over from that as co-op type bank.

I agree that the new loan system isn't as bad as has been made out. But at the end of the day, Â£50k debt is still Â£50k debt, and that will only ever complicate things (moving abroad, etc.) and keep in mind that it is the perception that really matters rather than the reality (for better or worse).

&gt;But for the moment, an economy with more manufacturing in it will provide more jobs and revenue, both of which we need.

Yeah, I kinda agree, I mean it's better than nothing. But I mean, I still think we'd do better to take an active approach in stopping unemployment, by government investment, etc. as just lowering tax might not do it (and any effect would be delayed anyway).

&gt;I think that we should focus on this in stages, firstly a pan-European separation of retail and investment banking (doing it in the UK alone wouldn't work)

Well for once we actually agree on something entirely :P

My real worry at the moment is that the government is largely run by banking interests, and so we'll probably just end up repeating the mistakes of the past with no changes, as no-one outside the loop has any say whatsoever.

So if a product was Â£1.20 by itself, or two for Â£2, how is it cheaper to go and do two separate transactions at Â£1.20? 

I work in Tesco and I'm well aware that we have some offers in which the SEL states that, for example, a bottle of Irn Bru is 70p, but on two for Â£1.50. Obviously at first glance you'd think that thats a bit of a scam. But this is because this offer applies to multiple products...so if you bought Irn Bru at 70p and say, Sprite at Â£1, you would save 20p. The till software would *never* increase the price of a product, it is in fact impossible for cashiers to do this without putting it through as a generic item. (dept. sale)

On a side note, interesting oversight from Tesco which has been long fixed : Say product is buy one get one free and is Â£2. Till software was programmed to calculate this buy subtracting Â£2 of the final price if two products went through. However, if both products were reduced to say, Â£1 (with the yellow reduction labels), *the till software would still take Â£2 off, which means the customer would get them for free!* Whats even more hilarious is if they were reduced to say, 50p, the tills would *still* take Â£2 off, meaning that if a customer came through and just purchased those two items, the till would go to negative tender and in order to keep the cash office happy, you would have to give the customer Â£1 back!

Oh the joys. :P",0,1301095997,null,0,false,0,c1mcpyi,t3_gbejz,t1_c1mcpyi,t1_c1mc5i9,1427013798,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Yup, and we've been doing it for centuries. Before we did it, a variety of other nations also did this. It's pretty safe to say that at any given point in history the dominant society in whatever area you pick was exploiting the less advanced cultures within it's sphere of influence. It's nothing new.

&gt; Why is it that we think it is acceptable to 'help' all these current wars instead of helping the less fortunate get educated and get a job, help our economy get back on track with more money being transferred into public services instead of military warfare? I mean we don't even have money for our military yet we start getting involved in Lybia

Partly, they have resources we need. People don''t like admitting this, but we're reliant on resources the world doesn't have enough of, and that are mostly in areas far away from us. And without these resources we wouldn't be able to have education or public services that were worth anything compared to what we have now. You might hate it but frankly without stable energy and resource supplies, we're screwed. So yes, we are killing people to ensure we have the resources we need. Get used to it, because it's only going to get worse.

But with Libya, there is also the problem of Gadaffi. He is brutal. The 1996 Abu Salim prison massacre saw 1200 people, mostly political prisoners, killed in less than 3 hours. During the recent uprisings there have been frequent accounts of piles of bodies discovered mutilated, mostly of soliders that refused to fight. Yes, we sold him weapons, but frankly Regan should have finished the job back in the 80's and killed him them. If we didn't intervene in this then not only would the result be verging on genocide, it would also show the rest of the Arab world that people who supposedly proselytize democracy and freedom don't care about them.

&gt; Britain to me is beggining to fail and fall behind to other '1st world' countries that are 'stealing' our educated.

See, the way RTD did things really changed Who from what it was. In the classics almost everything that happened on earth could have happened, just hushed up. With RTD everything was a giant explosion, end of the world, daleks everywhere etc. It made Doctor Who something obviously taking place in a fantasy reality, rather than in our reality as the classics would have you believe.

So when Moffat got the show he wanted to bring Who back to its roots in some ways. Now, how to explain all these events in our history that we know did not happen? The cracks, they gobbled everything up and the Doctor fixed it all, creating our reality, as it really is. So therefor, no giant cyberman in our history, no Dalek invasion, no anything that you could know for a fact did not happen in our reality.

Because women are protected, black people are protected, homosexuals are (mostly but not fully) protected and disabled people are protected, the male, or the white man, or the heterosexual man is the only remaining set of  attributes that can be made fun of or put down without an associated ism. I'm not suggesting that to put down people based on other attributes is right, far from it. However, we live in a world where other attributes have had rights movements with mixed success, heterosexuals, whites and men have not had such a movement and as such no-one speaks up for their rights. This is what leads to discriminative policies such as 'affirmative action', a great example of which was Blair's female shortlist - an 'affirmative action' that instead of choosing people on merit, resulted in a completely counterproductive set of politicians referred to as 'Blairs babes'.

Some businesses are inherently moral, and had conscience as part of their mission.

The original founder of the Guardian, Scott, insisted that his business was enlightened in all senses of the word. The current owners are a slightly different kettle of fish. Much more like UkUncut's targets, you might say.

Anyhow, shouldn't all people try to do good and be charitable, irrespective of their wealth? Or is a donation from a rich person worth less than a donation from the poor? That sounds like moralising, rather than morals. 

As an aside- I'm fairly qualified to talk about charity an the public sector- being that's where I work (social housing). I can confirm it's a bloated, moralistic, hypocritical mess that fails more times than it succeeds. The biggest barrier to things getting better is the entrenched mindset of the unions and the often poor quality of the managers, many of whom are more interested in clocking on until they can retire with a fab pension than actually doing a decent days work.

Your point about the relative cost of charity to a millionaire and someone worth 5k I can see appealing to the religious, but it is somewhat undermined by the fact it only looks at the cost to the giver, which is pretty irrelevant. A 10k gift can do a lot more good than a Â£50 one.

Yes, _corporate_ business by its very definition is amoral - it has one goal, the pursuit of profit. Whether enlightened self-interest is a social good, I'll leave for the Randians to argue, but corporate business is morally neutral.  However, it's clearly bad if you happen to be a human being, because corporations don't care about human beings unless they're consumers.

Corporations _under_ pay people for their labour.  In an ideal corporate world, workers are starving and work for the bare essentials and there is a huge pool of non-working labour to keep the price scraping the bottom of the market.  Full employment and fully paid out labour are an anathema to corporations.  Profits aren't so much theft as rent to lazy capital, workers work, owners of capital take interest and rent and profit and other forms of unearned income.  Capital never creates wealth without labour and indeed it adds nothing to the value of labour it's merely a tithe taken by the wealthy.

true,chochazel,null,null,"The massive danger is that they are cutting at the worst possible time - namely in a recession so...

 - Public sector workers lose their jobs

 - As a result, tax receipts come down and benefit payments go up

 - The newly unemployed stop spending their money in the private sector

 - People in the private sector start losing their jobs

 - Goto 2

We could easily end up with all these cuts *and* with a greater deficit.  This is what happened in the 1980s - Regan and Thatcher both came in saying they were going to roll back the frontiers of the state and the ended up spending loads on benefits (despite cuts) running massive deficits and massively increasing the national debt.

We were coming out of a recession, which necessarily means that tax receipts go up and benefit payments go down.  The deficit would have naturally been reduced anyway.  Britain was always seen as a safe bet with the bond markets; it's far from clear there was an immediate danger to the economy - certainly no worse than the danger posed by the cuts.  Now of course, there was a structural deficit, which means even with adjustment for the economic cycle a deficit would still have remained, but the sensible thing to do would be to get the reductions from economic growth, *then* cut the public sector and raise taxes when the private sector was in a position to fill in the gaps and experienced workers would be in high demand.

George Osborne is taking a massive gamble with the economy, there's no doubt.  The reason he's doing it now is purely political.  He was able to come in, act all shocked and surprised at the deficit (even though both parties obviously knew about the state of the public finances well before the election) and it was early enough into the parliament that he could still blame Labour, go into national emergency mode and use WW2 pulling-together spirit and the honeymoon period to sell the cuts to the public and hope the economy would somehow pull out of it and the budget would be balanced by the next election.  

It would have been simply politically disastrous to leave it three or four years, and introduce cuts so that the worst would be felt just before the next election... much better for the country, but far worse for the Conservatives.

There is also a strong air of using the sense of crisis to push through non-manifesto politically motivated pet projects that they wouldn't otherwise be able to sell or justify e.g. the Health 'reforms' which are actually nothing to do with the deficit.

There is also a failure to deal with the real causes of the problems:

- Bankers' bonuses are not just envy/punishment politics.  It's insane that there are people who are gambling with other people's money, getting hideously rich if the gamble pays off and losing nothing if it doesn't.  None of their own capital is at stake, yet they stand to make millions from good deals.  *Clearly* this will incentivise them to take far more risks than would be objectively rational.  As soon as everything starts booming, the whole thing will become a pyramid scheme once more; the growth in the investments is fuelled by new investments which are made with borrowed money to get the benefit of the growth in investments etc.  

The only move the government's made from its initial aggressive talk about banking reform is retreat.

- The wars and PFI were a key cause of the additional spending (though the deficits were historically tiny until the financial crisis.)  Until Afghanistan we had surpluses.  PFI is *such* a terrible deal for the taxpayer it really needs to be legislated against ASAP because that's potentially far more of a time bomb than public sector pensions, which, according to Hutton, are due to be a smaller percentage of the GDP year on year even without any changes.

- Tax avoidance is obviously now a major problem in the logic of the whole thing.

This all plays into the narrative that the most vulnerable and poorest are being made to pay for mistakes that were in no-way their fault, whilst those who are most culpable have the money to lobby for their interests.",0,1301172087,null,0,true,0,c1mgmub,t3_gc02q,t1_c1mgmub,t1_c1mfvmo,1427015637,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

I can think of about 5 immediate issues with your first paragraph, I'll only state the obvious one: Corporations, by and large, do care about their staff- staff tend to make up about 60-75% of the outgoings of a company. Self-interest (Randian or otherwise) would dictate that anything you sink that much cost into, you would care about.

As to the underpayment for labour- that's just gibberish. What's the alternative, higher payment that people should receive? If you mean that you -think- businesses should pay more, fine- great opinion. Companies should pay well: it breeds loyal, happy, focussed staff who feel good about themselves and the work they do. I know this, because I used to be a well paid corporate worker, before I left to go into the public sector. The rest of your paragraph is discredited Marxist theory, so I'll skip the kant, but the idea that there's some element of coercion in a labour transaction nowadays is ludicrous. I think you are proposing a system more akin to 1930's Russia, and I cannot remember how many people died as a result of that one, I only know that it was slightly less than the butchery that was taking place under another similar system just to the west of the USSR at the same time.

On the last bit, I'll avoid discussing religion- I think that the political system you are tacitly espousing is much closer to a religion than an economic one, and you seem to have read widely on that, so I'll assume you know a lot about religion.

The reason why no party put forward a comprehensive plan, was  because all parties would have had to make unfair cuts and tax rises that nobody would ever vote for (even if we waited a year before cutting more than the 6bn labour cut at the end of their term). The parties had to hide the truth to get elected. Now the election is over, people can pretend that the Coalition is elitist but all parties, realistically, would have had to make similar cuts (even to the NHS, there's no way it's sustainable or realistic to maintain current funding).

The original claim was that Labour massively increased the size of the state, whereas in fact it was the private sector that shrank. That is, the biggest change was due the the huge decrease in GDP, not a huge increase in the size of the state. Previous to the crash public spending was [still less](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/downchart_ukgs.php?year=1900_2010&amp;state=UK&amp;view=1&amp;expand=&amp;units=p&amp;fy=2010&amp;chart=F0-total&amp;bar=0&amp;stack=1&amp;size=1067_754&amp;color=c&amp;title=UK%20Public%20Spending%20As%20Percent%20Of%20GDP&amp;show=) that the Tories left it at in 1997.

&gt; Nope, the massive budget deficit and cuts were specifically mentioned. Historical revisionism?

Find the direct quote. Most of it is from headlines and the author. The credit agencies have no business pushing for policy and they know it.  They mention a ""strong fiscal consolidation plan"" and threaten to ""review the long-term rating"", but stop short of saying 'we'll drop the rating if you don't do such and such'. The same press release was reported by the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8567682.stm) completely differently. It even mentions the report says that ""Cutting government spending could jeopardise economic recovery and damage governments' power to tax"" to balance any mention of spending cuts. Even in a more recent [news report](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8403896/Moodys-warns-Britain-over-triple-A-credit-rating.html) (one that isn't prejudiced by 2010 electioneering), spending cuts are only mentioned in the context of how they affect economic growth.

&gt;It is their choice to offer it at that price and if you don't want it, don't pay for it.

Thanks for the condescending tone.

I am aware of the motivation behind the strategy. I still have a right to be pissed off by it.

Of course you might save money in the long term if you purchase non-perishables on offer, particularly if you normally would anyhow.  However, I do think think many offers are playing into a false sense of economy and people don't get nearly the money out of it they think they do. 

&gt;I bought four cartons of apple juice for Â£4. I could have bought 1 for 1.20. I saved money by buying in bulk

You still paid them Â£4 today when you might have come into the store intending to spend Â£1.20.  Multiply that by several items and your wallet might be quite a few pounds lighter each week. Even if you use every single thing you ever multi-buy ([and not many do](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/3341796/Wasted-food-costs-UK-homes-10-billion.html)) it's still a shitty deal, as I prefer my money in my bank account, not ""investing"" in long term apple juice futures.

The only things I've seen that have made any real difference here have been where protesters have had genuine leverage, worker strikes tend to do quite well. General protests appear to do and achieve nothing anymore.

It's quite discouraging.

If the government really is doing something that the majority doesn't want, then why the fuck should they be allowed to do it?

All they do is ignore the protesting, it's my opinion that more needs to be done. I say this not because I support the current protest but because I support a change in the way we all as a public go about stopping our government from doing things that aren't wanted.

Well, shipping is the 'art' of liking, supporting and/or encouraging a fictional pairing (sometimes to the dislike of those who 'ship' another pairing that involve one part of your couple. There are HermioneXRon shippers, and HermioneXHarry shippers. I actually ship Hermione and Snape...). It can come across as ""they're so cute"" to writing elaborate fanfiction.

OT3 is shorthand for something that's usually not canon- One True Threesome. Like OTP (One True Pairing) it's your preferred set of lovers. OT3 is usually what the fans go with when dealing with a canon love triangle and all three are likable characters.

With Doctor Who, some people ship Rory, Amy *and* The Doctor.

I'm generally of the opinion that people are contradictory and incapable of being rational about pragmatic policy decisions. It's not exclusive to the mob, it's something that politicians suffer from also.

&gt; It's our way of life and political systems which have turned us into children and victims and whiny little ""the government should do something"" victims. 

I would agree, but I would say that meritocracy combined with more localized forms of government would be a better solution to our immediate situation than demarcy or anarchy. It might even be a transitional system, but going from what we have now to anarchy would be in no ones interests. I also have issues with how a direct democracy would scale beyond the limitations of Dunbar's number, and how unpopular yet expert knowledge would fit in.

&gt; Desiring the impossible, in and of itself isn't a bad thing, how you go about achieving the best with what is is far more important. Politics is the art of the possible as they say and there's a progression from aspirations, to dreams to fantasies depending on how deliverable they are.

Well, as we've discussed before, meritocracy has its own critics (those who believe it would tear society apart, those who believe it is inherently conservative and biased towards the status quo - the self-defined ""best"" selecting the next generation of ""best"" etc.), but I'm certainly a fan of localism as you know.

There are multiple French Revolutions, the notable and relevant ones being in the late 1700's and around 1830. France undergoing multiple revolutions just over the Channel at least before 1832's Reform Act (coupled with the later 1848 revolutions across Europe and the 'revolt' in India against British rule) created a genuine fear of the potential of revolution in Britain. There was genuine fear of a revolution when the government couldn't agree on the terms of the 1832 Act, and even then when it was passed it wasn't quite as 'Great' as the title 'Great Reform Act' implied.

There was the Luddite and Chartist movements after, coupled with general resistance to the Poor Laws. Those people who claimed to care about who they represented did not neccessarily actually listen to them and in many cases (not all) seemed to live inside a sphere of their own.

Earl Grey, about the 1832 Reforms he put forward, actually said that ""There is no one more decided against annual parliaments, universal suffrage and the ballot than I am. My object is not to favour, but to put an end to such hopes and projects.""

My point was, you shouldn't really assume that changes happened gradually over time because the politicians felt kind. People wanted these changes and had to fight for them.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_structure_of_the_United_Kingdom

The social structure of the United Kingdom continues to be built on notions of social class. Though definitions of social class vary, most are linked to factors such as occupation, level of education and wealth. Until recently even the Parliament of the United Kingdom was organised on a class basis, with the House of Lords representing the hereditary upper class, and the House of Commons  representing everyone else. The Queen maintains her status at the top of the social class structure.

Since the 1980s there have been a number of social changes â the reform of the House of Lords, the expansion of home-ownership and higher education â which have altered the social landscape. Some have gone so far as to proclaim a classless society, although such claims have been met with skepticism.",0,1301228085,null,0,true,0,c1mjozc,t3_gb0mf,t1_c1mjozc,t1_c1mjo7h,1427017148,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I was on shift last night at a major news network, and we covered both angles separately. One package about the peaceful demonstration, one package about the riot. Two entirely separate events.

The reason why the riots took precedence? Because people smashing shit up is visually exciting, and very unusual. (Well not as much as it used to be). People are destroying public property, storming banks, and smashing windows of hotels, and you're asking us NOT to report on it? The major shopping and tourist area of London got shutdown for at least 8 hours as people were hurling smoke bombs and bricks at shops and you don't think this is newsworthy?

If we cover it, it's called sensationalism. If we don't cover it, it's called censorship. Just giving you a different perspective. 

FYI, until this screen cap, the BBC actually ran ONLY a front page about the protest MARCH, not the riot. With a total of four photos of the march, followed by one photo of the riot. This was the case until I finished my shift at 0600 this morning. I know because we check it frequently.

But of course, we're all pricks in the media aren't we? Being run by a massive overlord with an agenda against the people. Utter bullshit. Look at Libya State TV. That's what you're accusing us of being. 

Those people that donned masks and destroyed things in the city should be the focus of your hate. They weren't part of your march, but they stole your thunder. They were only out to destroy, they didn't give a fuck about your message.

Your argument for a robin hood tax is to penalize the banks because they did bad things. Yes I was paraphrasing and trivializing that to them being 'mean and nasty'. I was doing this because you are deploying an argument which is trivially simplistic. 

Your argument *deserved* trivializing:

* Banks are entities made up of people, the people who fucked up the economy have already gotten vast payouts. Even if you damage their industry the lesson is still 
&gt;""If you fuck up the economy thats O.K. so long as you personally make out before it blows up"" 

* Banks were bailed out by the tax payer, this was deemed necessary, there has been no structural or regulatory change thus if banks are punished to the point of insolvency they will once again require bailing out. 

Finally a robin hood tax is not a liberal idea, I count myself as a liberal (in the UK sense of liberalism not the fucking crazy US sense). A robin hood / Tobin tax is an attempt at increasing the 'friction' of trade, please for the love of god if you're going to get involved politically and actively protest for this at least google what is involved and some of the arguments / reasons for wanting to do it.

Having said all this - I'm very glad you are at least interested enough politically to care, I *do* think all is not well with the UK and the coalition but the march for an undefined alternative was quite clearly just the unions trying to big up their own support.

&gt;The report concluded that North sea oil revenue would have given an independent Scotland one of the strongest currencies in Europe and a large tax surplus. It went on to say that officials advised government ministers on how to take ""the wind out of the SNP sails"". The incoming Labour administration classified the document as secret over fears it could give a further boost to the SNP's policy of Scottish independence

&gt;In the previously confidential advice to ministers, Professor McCrone said that an independent Scotland could be transformed by oil revenues and become a leading power in Europe. 

&gt;""Just as deposed monarchs and African leaders have in the past used the Swiss franc as a haven of security... the Scottish banks could expect to find themselves inundated with a speculative inflow of foreign funds.

The problem here is 95% about the community not bothering to do anything about it and assuming that the police can...  To arrest a dealer they need to know who they are and have enough evidence to obtain a warrant as well as getting enough evidence during a search to make an arrest.  To arrest a user they need to get there whilst they still have the gear on them.  If the community in which a problem is occurring doesn't help the police out in some way, the police are always going to be on the back foot in dealing with the issue, if no one reports such activity they will always be a few steps.  Yet most of the time the community around the problem does nothing, either due to apathy, involvement of fear.

On the other hand traffic officers are always on the road (quite legitimately) and are there to see the law broken...

So if you want your drug problem dealt with, raise it with the police a few times, tell them what you see and what you know, that way they might have enough information to do something proper about it.  The biggest problem the officers I know in my local area have is that people are happy to complain broadly about an issue but rarely provide enough specific information to do anything about it, it's frustrating for them to know who drug dealers are but not have anything they can use to justify either surveillance or further action.

That said, I wish my lot would get out of their cars more often, they are likely to see more if they are on foot rather than driving past at 30mph, of course if they did that we'd need rather more of them to cover the same areas and the way things are going with the cuts we are going to see the opposite (as well as less time for officers to do their actual jobs because they are losing admin staff too..).",0,1301243525,null,0,false,0,c1mkele,t3_gb9wj,t1_c1mkele,t1_c1mcp0d,1427017486,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Nobody claimed that they did any of these except hitting people with shields and batons, and kicking people in the legs. I have the bruises to prove this. What is it about right wingers and intellectually offensive hyperbole?

&gt; The actual TUC rally was a perfectly reasonable event. UKUncut should have joined with that as opposed to going off, doing their own self-aggrandising thing which allowed (as they absolutely must have known would happen, unless they really are a disorganised bunch of idiots) the fuckwits to coat-tail them with their own bullshit vandalism.

UKUncut believe in direct action, and we saw by example of the anti-war protests that sometimes simply marching isn't enough. Of course this won't change things over night, but peaceful direct action (and the occupation was peaceful) sets seeds and proves points. Black bloc are nothing to do with UKUncut, and it isn't like they can ban anyone that's a potential member from attending UKUncut actions.

Absolute load of bollocks right there. People were dancing, singing, playing samba and happily drinking with each other.

I am afraid in the various threads on here and elsewhere re Saturday I have seen numerous responses raving on about police 'brutality'.

&gt;we saw by example of the anti-war protests that sometimes simply marching isn't enough.

No it ain't. However in the General Election of 2005 the LibDems ran on an unequivocal anti-war, withdrawal manifesto and got 22% of the votes. Marching would be enough if it actually reflected what people think on major issues. It does not.

&gt;Black bloc are nothing to do with UKUncut, and it isn't like they can ban anyone that's a potential member from attending UKUncut actions.

I did not say they were; UKUncut however, like to represent themselves as savvy users of direct action (and I have some sympathy with them - please stop with the 'anyone who remotely says something I disagree with is a dripping-fanged right winger' bollocks) and even their most sympathetic supporter has to acknowledge they made a ricket on Saturday by going off an doing their own thing.

&gt;We were told we were allowed to occupy. Fires were fucking tiny and just to keep warm. 

Being allowed to 'occupy' (I assume by this language you mean you were allowed to go to the public space that is Trafalgar Square) is not the same as setting fires however 'tiny'.

* Connexions: A service that helps people especially from families where people aren't massively clued up about getting a job, get into employment -- this was a brilliant tool that helped to break the benefit dependency loop.

* David Cameron has stated that he wishes to privatise as much as he can. This is awful, there are services that are NOT supposed to make money and by trying to make them function as a business, you are creating a huge conflict of interest.

This has spawned a somewhat fanwank-y retcon explanation for how the two versions of the story can possibly exist, which goes along these lines:

* Originally, the events played out with the Fourth Doctor. Let's call this Shada(4).
* As a result of the events of The Five Doctors, the events of Shada(4) were undone, meaning that no one was able to stop Skagra from finding Salyavin - throwing the rest of causality into imbalance. Let's call this Shada(0).
* Because the effects of Shada(0) would eventually ripple out to the rest of the universe, possibly leading to the destruction of everything, the universe (or possibly the Time Lords) could not logically allow Shada(0) to exist, so some other instance of Shada must exist. By chance, the Eighth incarnation was more available, thus leading to Shada(8).

OTOH, I'm not really happy with how the sonic screwdriver has now morphed into a full-fledged magic wand.  River needs to increase the reception on her radio, so she says ""Can you sonic me?""  He points it at her when she's about 60 feet away, and though it has no obvious sights or anything else to help aim the thing, he wiggles the one button it has, and it upgrades all the electronics in her radio in a half second.  How did the screwdriver know which of the objects in front of it he was interested in?  How did the screwdriver know he wanted to upgrade the electronics instead of, say, undo the screws on the back so he could look inside?  Why, it's a telepathic magic wand!  Even Harry Potter has to say the name of a spell to use his wand; the Doctor just has to *think* what he wants it to do.

The main thing I like in 11 is that they have made him a bit less ""human"" - a bit more mysterious and obvious about knowing he is the brains+experience of the operation.

His performance feels more like the older Doctors than the previous two for this reason: take Pertwee, remove the karate, mix in some of Trouton's more playful persona (and a very small touch of Bakers ""is he completely batshit or not?""), modernise the writing to match the current audience, and finally add a great performance by the lead actor and the rest of the cast, and you've got 11.

Apparently he has signed up for another series, which is a good thing.

true,MissCrystal,smith,Smith,"&gt;It makes sense to me that 10 would be moodier than 11; he's still a lot closer to the Time War, and when he first regenerates he hasn't really told anyone about his part in it. With any horrible burden, you usually feel a lot better after you say it out loud. Once it's out, it's a lot smaller. You can be more you after that. Eleven is clearly a more unburdened Doctor than Ten was.

I totally agree here.  I've been feeling like the new Doctors are going through the stages of grief, actually.  9 was in denial and angry.  He even engaged in a bit of bargaining.  ""If I save all these people from the nanogenes, I will make up for what happened/what I did and everything will be ok!"" 10 had moved on to the sad and moody, but he slipped back into those other emotions from time to time, since grief is never really linear. 11 is progressing quite well, almost back to a more normal state of mind, except that he's still trying to keep people a bit at a distance. 

That being said, he's BAD at keeping people at a distance.  He's got a bit of a fatherly instinct thing going on with Amy.  He met her when she was so young and he lectures her on her clothing and he tries to make sure her relationship is going well, because he knows Rory is loyal and loving and will be good for her.  He worries about her, and often thinks of her as young, naive, and unable to take care of herself/make decisions on her own.  She surprised him with the Star Whale, so he's slowly letting her make more of her own decisions, but it's been hard for him.

He's healing.  Slowly, but it's definitely happening.  I think Amy and Rory will leave before he's ready for them to, but I think ultimately he will understand why they had to go then and he will like knowing that his little bird has flown the nest, if that makes sense.  I really think HIS feelings there are pretty parental, despite what Amy would like.

I'm really interested in where they will take his character next, too.  I bet it's going to be FANTASTIC.  Moffat's writing is so strong, and he's very good at giving us such complete characters, flaws and all, that I'm dying to know where he sees the Doctor going next.",0,1301274313,null,0,false,0,c1mmfkr,t3_gcm5e,t1_c1mmfkr,t1_c1mm8kq,1427018451,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

Amy restoring the universe wasn't predicated on what conscious knowledge or memories she possessed. If that were true she wouldn't be able to bring back entire planets, galaxies even, historical events from all across time and space or even the previous Doctors.

If we consider that time is wibbly wobbly via a non-linear, non-subjective stand point. River's final encounter with the Doctor is her death (Silence in the Library/Forest of the dead). This means she has had all her encounters with future Doctors (Eleven, possibly Twelve and beyond). In her final adventure she explicitly mentions the events of the wreckage of the Byzantine and stopping the end of the universe, both series 5 adventures in her past but the Doctors future. To quote Data ""It has occurred. It will occur."" when River encounters Amy in Time of Angels she plays it cool even though from River's perspective she just saved the whole universe with both Amy and the Doctor, no biggie, but Donna becoming the Doctor Donna, an event River immediately knows as one of the most significant events in the Doctor's life leaves her speechless when she comes to the realization of what point in the Doctor's time line shes in.

Not to mention in the Sarah Jane Adventures episode with Eleven after Big Bang while Rory and Amy are on their honeymoon before Christmas Carol, the Doctor asks Sarah Jane and Joe to remember every moment they ever had with him she has a flashback to the events of Stolen Earth.

People don't talk to each other in the street, let alone give people orders like that; they mind their own business.

You have to remember that these people are activists. They do give a fuck. People, including myself, *were* picking stuff up and *were* telling people to put shit back. 

Some people in the thread have been saying we should have citizen's arrest the thieves but that's insanity.

I'm 90% certain that was the guy I pulled out by the shoulder, actually. One with a black hoodie and a bag? There's an easter egg in that bag ;-) It's hard to dell due to the masks and stuff, but he had a kind of scrawny shape that was quite particular.

So a system of giving money to collages and schools, who can give their students grants based on what they actually need would be better than a blanket amount of money going to a large amount of students based on a limited set of rules.

You can't have your mobility essentially limited by a test you take at 11, that is insanity. Get rid of religious state schools and grammar schools, and fund secondary moderns/comprehensives much more. One school system for all! And there's no reason that brighter pupils would be limited, that is why there is streaming and setting.

It's a huge argument, but one thing is certain. Since Grammar schools were abolished the number of working class kids getting into the higher reaches of life has declined dramatically. As a result most of our leading politicians today are from private schools. Your hostility to grammar schools is based in ideology alone, not facts.

&gt; Where exactly has it worked? And how?

Telecoms has worked quite well.

&gt; That says RBS and LLoyds, who in turn own other banks. But we also bailed out Bradford &amp; Bingley, Northern Rock, and HBOS.

Northen Rock was nationalised, and we forced Lloyds to buy HBOS, which resulted in Lloyds needing a bailout. But again, not bailing out these banks would have caused more problems.

&gt; So a system of giving money to collages and schools, who can give their students grants based on what they actually need would be better than a blanket amount of money going to a large amount of students based on a limited set of rules.

It would be interesting to see how you'd actually regulate this, and make sure there was a standard, fair way of doing this without having a national body to manage it anyway.

&gt; But if the staff were rolled into the Jobcenter then it's a single point of call for all career and job related inquires. No point maintaining 2 organizations when one could provide both functions.

But this isn't happening, connexions are being laid off.

&gt; Only because they haven't had to. Again, it would be better to put the resources directly into the places they are required rather than maintain a separate system.

I don't understand ""haven't had to"". Telling people to do more with less isn't some magical way to make things more efficient, it simply puts additional strain on an already strained system, and quality goes down. The national guideline limit for teacher is to do no more than 30 cover periods in an *entire year* - they should be an emergency measure. She did 30 last *half term*. It's killing her.

&gt; It's a huge argument, but one thing is certain. 

It is a very big argument, but I do think the arguments for selection are generally super-ceded by the arguments for streaming.

But I think it is more of a symptom than a cause, I mean I don't think anyone would choose the life of a single mother living in a poor council estate area or living off of the black market teasing out an existence.

The problem is that many of these areas have gotten so bad due to a lack of decent employment in the area. Having parents on benefits affects the attitude of the children too and leads to a terrible cycle.

Even if we cut the benefits these people would just turn to crime or whatever to survive - they aren't simply going to disappear and as the investment to help them find work is also being cut it seems that crime is the only alternative.

That doesn't justify what they do at all of course - but it is important to remember that these problems don't have a simple solution of just cutting the benefits even if one could ensure that the vast majority of benefit claimants were protected (which doesn't appear to be happening either)",0,1301317835,null,0,false,0,c1monhe,t3_gckx3,t1_c1monhe,t1_c1mmfz7,1427019493,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Perhaps you should come along next time, this shit happens all the time. If you don't move, they'll grab you, hit you with shields, but most commonly they will kick you in the legs. Now if you're actively trying to hold them off I guess it comes with the territory, but often people end up between protesters and police without realising and all of a sudden batons are raining in. I was grabbed and swung around by my bandana until I got loose and threw it off.

A bit of a generalization. It really depends on the size of the organization. In my experience having worked for firms with 10 staff members and 400000 staff members the larger the organization is the more waste you will see. Mainly because it's easier to hide yourself away inside a big firm than it is in a smaller firm where people know each other. For instance working for a university and for BT, the level of waste was around the same with the exception that the university environment had an attitude of ""more money will come from somewhere"", rather than BT's attitude of ""we must save money, so here is a list of stupid things we can do to save money"". At larger firms that are are result of a merger between a formally state firm and a firm that has always been private, I noticed a huge distinction between staff from the state owned part, who were much more opposed to changes in the firms direction than staff from the always private bit.  

As for the private sector as whole creating more jobs, it will if we work at it. It won't do it overnight, but if we spend time creating the right environment and educating people with the right skills then it will. And this is important because without a more vibrant private sector we won't be able to fund the public sector correctly.

And I can't think of anyone who will need the council officials who sniff ashtrays as part of their job for that matter.

A lot of what the government does is seen as waste by companies. The private sector exists to make money, and they already have enough challenges.

Victory of the Daleks was a hit (he loves the Daleks) and any Cyberman episode. Vampires of Venice kept his attention (he likes the ladies). Cold Blood was great because the Silurians are really effective visual monsters.

I suppose in situations like this you have to think about the alternatives.

If they ask them to all leave quietly so they can arrest them, then they're unlikely to all just file out.  If they release everyone then the shop sues them for not enforcing the law.

My guess is the police were going for the wrong target/s and it will be thrown out. Just my humble opinion I hasten to add. 

The  irony is with the whole thing that the stupid people who committed the damage to property in the name of freedom or anarchy or whatever they damn think, are the whole reason why the police have to come out in such force in the first place. They are the people who caused the kettling and all those innocent people to be arrested and in some cases hit with batons.

I disagreed with the TUC and I just went out for a days fun and in the main found a carnival atmosphere. I witnessed some masked protestors throwing stones and paint at property but more disturbingly I witnessed the police threatening and even physically hurting other human beings.

If I were to hypothesize though I would say that everything the timelords did before the time war is concrete. So when the timewar (and Galifrey) were locked away so were the other time lords... in a way.

[Warning, working this out as I type]

Because the time war was part of the timelords collective timeline they couldn't interact with a timelord from after it. See, the timelords run on Galifrey time, or they did, and Galifrey is out of time. I don't even think it is really a physical place anymore, and can only be reached by time travel. So, with this the way it is there is no time before the timewar anymore, and back before it there was no time after. At least from a timelords perspective.

true,ruaidhri,mcgann,McGann,"&gt;It's been suggested, for instance, that Genesis of the Daleks is the Time Lords' first offensive against the Daleks in the War.

I've always liked that theory. It makes sense, given that the Time Lords were using the Doctor and time travel as a weapon against the Daleks. Am pretty sure once the Daleks copped on to that, they must have worked hard to find time travel technology so they could retaliate against the Time Lords. 

It also means that the Doctor was the one individual who started and ended the Time War.

Also yes to a Paul McGann on screen appearance. A nice potential storyline I heard would involved River killing the 8th Doctor,perhaps as a hired assassin sent by the Daleks at the end of the Time War. It has a nice potential for a multi-doctor setting involving 8,9,10,11. Perhaps the other regenerations of the Doctor could rescue/save River, making her realise what a mistake she's made.

The increase in fees will help to drive people into courses that they feel are a worthwhile investment, but unfortunately those from poorer backgrounds are going to see the cost and turn tail because it is a lot of money (even if it is not an up front payment).

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"these are some really flimsy arrests for a peaceful demonstration with very little damage caused, it wasn't malicious, and it was basically just a sit in, which UKUncut have done many times before without being arrested. It is not anything like the chaos that the tabloids have been parading about. if you take out the 150 that were arrested in this peaceful demo, that gives you about 60 arrests for what i would deem unacceptable behaviour. If you take the more generous figure of 500,000 protestors, that gives you an arrest rate of 0.012%. An 8th of the average arrest rate for a football match. Do you see football trouble on the front page of the dailymail every week? No! The trouble with this country, is that too many people think definition of patriotism is to agree with everything that is written in the tabloids. And that's how you control the proletariat. 

Any movement that is a threat to the current system is delegitimized via a sensationalist propaganda machine masquerading as the free press, presenting their agendas in an underhand way that the working class is too busy to look into properly, thanks to decreasing wages and increased work hours which means they don't have the time to educate themselves about the reasons why they have to work so hard for so little. And so they get their world views in a quick fix from these hideously corrupt institutions who know their readerships are ill informed &amp; lack the resources to become informed. These institutions are thus able to convince the ill informed that they are looking out for the interests of the working/middle classes, and so anyone that questions the propaganda is met with suspicion/hostility from these classes. And that is how any movement that could possibly upset the oligarchy and mobilise the working class is nipped in the bud so easily, time and time again. Want evidence of this? There were 8 times less arrests for violent offences at this protest than at an average football match. Yet this is front page news and is being used as leverage to put greater restrictions on protests. My friends are also now convinced that all the protestors are scum. How fucking obvious could it be?

Not to mention dividÃ© et impera. Some people blame immigrants for lack of social cohesion. What a load of old tosh. Community spirit and social cohesion was destroyed when wages were forced down, hours were increased, people didn't have the time to spend with their neighbours, consumerism took hold, and we were all holed up in our own houses looking at the flashing picture box, not talking to the rest of our community, but swallowing everything in the media that told us to beware of our neighbours. watch out for the paedophiles, don't trust the blacks, muslims are evil, all gays have got aids, there's rapists everywhere. dont go outside, there are too many people that are a threat to you. stay indoors. it's safe there.
(evidence? crime rates are actually going down. paedophilia has not increased in decades. blatant propganda)

And that's how you keep the proletariat down.

Couldn't agree more, my GF is a political journalist, I've tried to get her on here ( and r/UKpolitics ) several times because her own opinion on certain topics is, quite frankly, way more informed than ours is. I sometimes discuss political issues with her a few days/weeks before it ever goes to press. 

However, she won't even entertain this place because of editorialising ( she reads the topic headers and it winds her up)  in fact it drives her mad to the point of her not even liking *me* coming here. She's like: "" Why do you even discuss politics with people you don't even know who have opinions like that?"" 

If however she got into the comment discussions I'm sure ( in fact I know because we have some pretty well informed discussions here) she'd change her opinion of this place. 

I dunno, maybe it turns other informed people off too. It's kind of a big deal with the press this sort of thing.

Why this Doctor, who had fought with gods and demons, why he had run away from us and hidden. He was being kind. He wrapped my father in unbreakable chains forged in the heart of a dwarf star. He tricked my mother into the event horizon of a collapsing galaxy to be imprisoned there, forever. He still visits my sister, once a year, every year. I wonder if one day he might forgive her, but there she is. Can you see? He trapped her inside a mirror. Every mirror. If ever you look at your reflection and see something move behind you just for a second, that's her. That's always her. As for me, I was suspended in time and the Doctor put me to work standing over the fields of England, as their protector. We wanted to live forever. So the Doctor made sure we did.

Texts to the emergency service were recently enabled to allow deaf people to call. I guess you could also use this if you didn't want to be heard on the phone for whatever reason. 

I also believe that the services can send your phone a specifically formed text message, which if your phone has GPS, will get it to send back your co-ordinates.

As freerangetrousers(?) has noted, you need to provide the basics of english pub food - roast beef (and chips), roast chicken (and chips), roast lamb (and chips), etc. As described, chunky chips, not skinny fries. Gravy certainly an option (but not assumed).

[Chips](http://www.otherother.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/chips.jpg) are not [crisps](http://www.yes-zim.com/shopimages/products/thumbnails/crisps.jpg), btw. I realise you are probably aware of this, but it is worth pointing out, just in case. :)

As far as importing your own menu, I'll give you a basic breakdown based purely on my own personal opinion:

Philly Cheesesteaks :sounds like a  basic **steak sandwich** here, and perfectly acceptable. Just don't call it a Philly cheesesteak.

Ranch Dressing : Not a problem, as an extra. Well known

Chicken Fried Steak with White Gravy : Advertise as Southern Fried Chicken, you'll be fine. No-one here knows of White Gravy, though. Call it **Pan-fried Chicken Steak with BÃ©chamel sauce**, and you'll be laughing. I want the copyright, though. I'm not kidding. This **will** be your best-seller. I'll check up on you, you know. I know people. Important people.
 
Fried Chicken : Not a problem.

BBQ Ribs : Not a problem.

Gumbo : Don't even think about it. Seriously. Call it 'Southern Stew', however...

Jambalaya : Debatable, but you might get away with it, although I doubt it.

Pulled Pork BBQ : Call it slow-cooked pork, you'll be fine. Don't dare serve it in a bun though.

Mac n Cheese : Known here as Macaroni cheese. Not a problem, as long as home-made, and cheesy.

Burritos, Tacos, Enchiladas : Mexican always goes down well, as long as this not *too* hot - the hot option is always good to offer, though.

King Ranch Chicken : just call it chicken casserole, you'll be fine.

Smores : Weird cracker/marshmallow/chocolate weirdness. We'd probably like it, but it don't call it smores, call it chocomarsh delight or something. (95% of your customers will not know 'smores')

Apple Pie ; Well, d'oh!

Fried Catfish : Catfish a no-no in UK (Europe, fine, but not UK) - just does not sell well. Carp is similar, and will sell in UK.

Coleslaw : Not a problem

BBQ Slaw : BBQ coleslaw?

Huspuppies : WTF is this?

Chicken Pot Pie : Just call it Chicken Pie, or Chicken Hot Pot, you'll be fine.

Chicken 'n' Dumplings : Dumplings more traditionally served with beef stew here, but you might be okay.

Shrimp Etoufee: See 'Gumbo'

Pimento Cheese : No. Just no.

Fried Green Tomatoes : Will not sell, sorry.

Chicken Alfredo : Huh? Isn't Alfredo a pasta dish? Is this just chicken pasta?

Meatloaf : Universal, I think.

Good luck. Hope I have not made things too complicated!

Does the PM want the subs to carry out retaliation/vengeance? Because they're in no position to research the identity of the attacker. Anyway, if the attacker was obvious the US or some European allies would take care of them (Before they themselves could be hit), and if it's terrorists; it'd be hard to hit those responsible with a full blown army, never mind an emotional crew trained primarily in submarine warfare (Pretty sure the secret to winning in Afghanistan is not submarines).

So does it tell them to get on with their lives? The world as we know it has changed completely; the world's truly gone nuclear, and chances are there'll be more (see above point).

The most logical thing to do in my mind is hand control to the captain. The rest of the country doesn't exist any more, and if the UK's been attacked it's unlikely to be the only target; why defend a dead nation, and why attack a country before you know the current situation? No real choices can be made except by those still alive; and who knows but them what they're facing?

All this pondering leads me to believe the letters are likely to be nothing more but an 'inspiring message' about how Britain still lives on; the survivors are the future and whatever they have to deal with now may God be with them.

true,SendInTheNinjas,null,null,"Hi there. I read in your response below that you're considering opening in Cheltenham. I actually grew up near Cheltenham. Whilst it has some rather boring 'identikit' places like whetherspoons/pizza express etc, it also has some individual, more expensive restaurants tucked away. What would probably be a good idea is something in the middle. Something that offers quality, not mass produced, food but for a reasonable price. I don't think people want an American or Cajun style place - that's really not what people eat round here. We don't want another 'branded' place that's trying to create a 'look' or a 'theme'. If you're going to do pub food, it has to be nice, homely, 'warm' meals that people find comforting. In the winter, it should be roasts and pies etc, in the summer lighter dishes with fish and salad.

One final thing - please for the love of whatever, consider people with allergies. There are a lot of us, and we'd like somewhere to eat too. The most common allergy is to wheat/gluten, which means all the 'mainstream' places in Cheltenham are no good, because they all do Italian food or things in pastry. It's not hard to make gluten-free alternatives to things, and it really makes a difference for people. Also please be careful with cross-contamination of known allergens like nuts/fish/milk. You might think it's silly, but if your place is known to be good with allergies then you'll get a set of loyal customers who'll keep returning because they know they'll be safe there, and they'll also spread the word about your place to others. Also, don't forget the veggies - the UK has a big veggie group and all of your menu above had meat in it. 

Anyway, good luck with your pub and maybe my mum, brother and I will come in if you actually serve something we can eat. ",0,1301448120,null,0,false,0,c1mycsv,t3_ge9ow,t1_c1mycsv,t3_ge9ow,1427024186,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The standard of a fair amount of English pub food of the 'chips with everything' variety, is pretty poor.   
IMO the general rule is, if the pubs main focus is drinking, the food will be poor. But lots of pubs these days have seen they can pull customers away from restaurants by offering a higher standard of food, so they make much more effort with their menus. I'm guessing you'd fall into this category. 
I used to live in a fairly backwater village 30mins north of Cheltenham.  A pub there has been doing well since introducing a tapas menu. If that can work there, you'll be fine in Cheltenham. 
So I think you should go with what you know, and use the authentic American themed menu as a usp. Don't water it down or change it until you get feedback from your regular customers. ",0,1301448145,null,0,false,0,c1mycvd,t3_ge9ow,t1_c1mycvd,t3_ge9ow,1427024186,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,SendInTheNinjas,null,null,"Well for the vegetarians it's quite simple, I guess. Say if you have a burger, do a veggie burger too. Do some dishes that are vegetarian 'classics' (am not a vegetarian so don't know them) where there's no meat or fish. Always remember to have a variety of red meat, white meat, and fish options as people have different tastes. 

As someone with food allergies, eating out can be very disappointing. I can't count the number of times I've stared at a menu and literally found nothing to eat. If you get someone come in with an allergy, don't make a big thing of it. We hate that. We feel like freaks anyway. Quietly tell them that you will discuss things with chef, then come back and tell them what chef suggests they can have, like 'you can have X without the Y', or 'Z is definately not safe' etc. There are also some simple steps you can take to make things more gluten-free. Firstly, make all your sauces/gravy with cornflour instead of regular flour, and state this on your menu. Don't roll your meat in flour before you cook it, I mean what is the point. Please have things that don't have breadcrumbs or pastry on. Have a gluten-free desert that's not ice-cream (we're not all 5 thank you) - creme brulee is a good one. Make sure all your dishes are prepared in a way that, if someone like me comes in with an 'odd' allergy (tomatoes in my case), you can make the dish without them. Simply taking them off an already done plate IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. 

What we really like is places that go the extra mile for us allergy nutters. Do a gluten free pie. Do a gluten free cake. For the love of christ do a range of things that don't have flour in - things like shepheards pie *do not* need flour in, it's just silly. Please don't just do steak and chips. Keep everything in your kitchen ordered and contained so we're not constantly worried that chef has previously prepared something that might kill us. It really makes the world of difference to people when they find a place that actually understands and is willing to accomodate a health issue they have no choice over. My mum and I have actually been refused service in places because we're 'too difficult'. If you make us feel like normal people, we'll keep coming back.

No stringent measures were taken to regulate who can charge what.  When the vote was taken the plans were half-baked and rushed through, MPs didn't even really know what they were voting for.

As for ensuring more bursaries are available for lower income families, again no rigorous measures were set out.  Any subsidies offered to low income families should be purely related to living costs for the student in the short term and be nothing to do with the fees.  Tuition fees have no impact on students until they are earning a healthy wage.  Why should the family income have any relation to this long term, low risk loan?

The whole ""you look like Time Lords"" thing is a reference to a minor plotline in the Big Finish Audios (culminating in Zagreus). Unhidden Spoilers follow!


Basically, Rassilon is a huge xenophobe and tries to eliminate or change all the species that aren't like him, including humans. Part of his Time Travel expiriments opened a gateway to the previous universe and what he saw scared and repulsed him, so he wants to make everything in this universe like him. He was stopped before he could change everyone to look ""humanish"".


In terms of circular time; a lot of the EDA and Big Finish stories are based around the ""Big Crunch"" idea of universes constantly exanding from a Big Bang and then collapsing into a point of singularity and then exploding again. There are oodles of Lovecraftian monsters that found a way to escape the crunch and are from the ""Previous Universe"" (including space-vampires), sometimes the Time Lords are from the previous universe, sometimes not; some universes exist within others and leak out. It's heavily implied (sometimes) that humans will be the equivilent of the Time Lords in The Next Universe. 


""Taking of Planet Five"" was my proabably my favourite of these stories. It's lots of confusing fun.


The ""Monsters from a Previous Universe"" idea is carried over to the new TV series with ""Impossible Planet/Satan Pit""; the Doctor says the Beast being from before the universe is impossible, he probably just forgot about the six or seven other monsters he met from the previous universe. He does that.

Tennant was amazing, and he could lay it on with rich meaning as well, but I think Smith's performance is more brilliant in understatement. Compare Tennant's talk with Wilfred Mott, wherein he tells Wilfred that he sees mankind as giants, with Smith admonishing the captive Silurian for lying about being the last survivor of an extinct people or remarking to Kazran that he had, in 900 years of space and time, never met anyone who wasn't important.

The article is from 2010. Just saying.

Unpaid debt of any form has a negative effect upon an economy. If it is not paid back then the pain is transferred to the rest of the economy in the form of higher inflation and/or lower demand.

If the UK refused to pay back its government debt, for example, then the savings and investments of a lot of Britons would be severely compromised.

Moreover, if government debt just keeps getting higher and higher as a proportion of GDP, then so will the cost of paying interest on such debt. This then erodes the spending power of government because money is spent servicing debt rather than paying for hospitals, police, schools, welfare, etc. This erosion has already happened because of the actions of past governments.

Government debt tends to be financed by the rich, who naturally want to increase their wealthiness. Borrowing money from the rich in order to pay for health, education and welfare now ends up compromising health, education and welfare in the future while simultaneously enriching the wealthy.

Now I wasn't forced to sell my properties however there was a 95% foreclosure rate in one of the neighborhoods i build it, people were literally throwing their keys into the banks doors and running.  There was even 3 suicides in the area due to people loosing everything.

Now even though house prices went bellow what people borrowed, this shouldn't of caused so much problem becuase house prices bounce back.

The reasonable grounds for suspicion under the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act are very, very low, so unless a search is completely without suspicion it's likely to be ruled legal, and as I said above, even if it does turn out to be unlawful, there are no negative implications for any resulting prosecution case and the IPCC is highly unlikely to penalise officers significantly over mere illegal searches if they find them guilty at all.

Absolutely refuse to give consent; that should really be the default position for any civilian-police interaction involving civil rights, but I wouldn't expect it to work. If they stop and search regardless then it's always worth consulting a solicitor, though. Also, make sure you get all the required paperwork from the searching officer; if they do act illegally that's pretty much the only way to prove it short of video-taping the stop.

true,mizzermike,uk,Norwich,"Wages are paid to the staff at the library. (I think, or are libraries voluntary?)

Books are paid for, which distributes money to the publishing houses.


You seem to be missing the concept of aggregate demand in an economy. All money is an a circular flow, and the more that flows, the more is produced, the greater National Output.

For example, my road has no streetlights.

A streetlight is a public good, this means it is non-rivalrous and non-excludable. My benefiting from the streetlight does not reduce anybody else's ability to benefit from it, and the government cannot stop anybody else from benefiting from it.

Let's say the government decides to put a new light down my road. If a streetlight cost Â£10,000. Where does that money go? If 10% of the money goes to labour, the worker who constructed this new streetlight now has Â£1000 in his pocket.

The rest went to the cost of materials. Where does all this money go? Eventually it all ends up as wages, or it is used to buy more resources for the factory. (which will, in turn, end up in somebody's pocket)

Both the construction worker and the factory workers now spend this money on goods, the cost of these goods end up as somebody else's wage, then it is spent again.

**So how does Government spending increase GNP?**

More government spending means that households have more money to spend. If households are spending more, firms need to produce more goods to meet the increased demand. This may mean that the firm needs to hire some more labour, benefiting the economy even more and increasing output even further. More workers means even more spending and so the cycle continues.

note: this isn't 100% accurate, but it should give a good rough general understand to how government spending leads to an increase in aggregate demand.

They are not using legal means to avoid taxes that they don't owe. They are using means that have not being legislated against to avoid taxes they definitely do owe. It's a prime example of why we need a GAAR.

&gt; And why does that negate millions in charity donations?

The charitable donations are another tax write-off. The web of companies themselves are owned by a so-called charity of questionable motives. They may be just giving money to fake charities for all we know.

Also, the theories discussed above are from John Maynard Keynes (Keynesian economics) and the opposing view is known as monetarism.

Monetarism in short believes that markets naturally ebb and flow and that there's a theory of boom and bust and that Keynesian style economics sews the seeds for its own destruction. Opponents of monetarism refer to the paradox of thrift and that 'waiting for growth' is too risky.

Key thinkers/schools on both theories:
Keynesian Economics - Keynes, Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz

Monetarism - Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Austrian School, Chicago School
