Firstly I'll deal with this issue as this accusation makes me sick to the stomach! I'm by no exaggeration Lucas Leiva's biggest supporter. I tolerated all the stick I could handle for supporting Lucas ever since he came to the club, I've wore his shirt every season since he joined and have had an eye on him even before he came to Liverpool. He's my favorite player and I've always had confidence in his ability. Phew, that was a mouthful.

As for Carroll, I know how much potential he has but his fitness is a concern, he seems to be sluggish on the ball. He's never been a poacher though, he's the first man to get on headers and he has an absolute behemoth of a left foot but he doesn't find the space deep in the box.

Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all six series.

If you choose to start at 2005, please watch Blink beforehand. 2005 is a little hard and Blink will reassure you that it's worth it.",0,1319489822,null,0,false,0,c2u469m,t3_lnehq,t1_c2u469m,t3_lnehq,1427777304,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt;We have the same few people on our briefings most days and when we finally get enough to lock them up for a while crime rates for the priority crimes; burglary, vehicle crime, etc, noticeably fall and when they are released they go back up again.

I don't know if you've seen the stats for people convicted following the riots, but some figures I saw were roughly (from memory):

- 75% were under 24

- 75% had a previous conviction, with an average of 15 convictions each

- 0.6% were employed

Funnily enough, crime plummeted afterwards. I think you can draw your own conclusions here.

&gt;A large problem is, unsurprisingly, drugs. People have a habit they need to feed and when you don't work there is only one way to get that money. Solve the drug problem and I believe you'd reduce offending greatly.

But the black guardian - his entire purpose is to reduce the universe to chaos. When presented with the possibility of killing trillions of people, his response was ""A small beginning."" He didn't want conquest, he just wanted destruction. And he was willing to kill TRILLIONS of people, just as a manipulation technique to try to trick the Doctor into thinking he was the white guardian...

That kind of evil - it's not as mindless as The Satan Pit - it's genius and strategic and it wants to destroy everything, and he has the power, technology, and wit to make it happen if it weren't for the doctor being a half-step ahead of him.

Generally we are given discretion over arrests and actions. If we overstep or breach laws or policies we are expected to justify our actions alone and can lose our jobs. That said when you go to major incidents like the above or the London Riots you would not be able to say ""I am not going to join this police line"" because, quite rightly, this would be dereliction of duty. Unfortunately this also means you would be sucked into whatever happens next - be that widescale abuse or isolated incidents of excessive force. You could report it afterwards but it would be hard to impossible to stop it as it is happening on that scale.

I would like to think policing has changed dramatically in the last 20 years for the better, especially given the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which gave a lot more rights for the public before and after arrest.

It seems that when we get to major incidents like those mentioned senior management get involved and issue orders which don't necessarily make sense to those on the ground, but if they are lawful orders we are expected to comply as we do not have the over-all view those in charge supposedly have.

At the end of the day I would not be happy to follow an order which strongly broke my moral code unless it could be justified to me in a way that makes it obviously the correct course of action. Of course not following the order could cost me my job and it easier to say these things not having been in that situation.

The more reports we have the more of an idea we have of what is happening. We can see that, for example, this area is having a spate of cycle thefts and act on that - this is how we tend to catch people.

That is generally the problem too. We catch someone who is clearly committing, for instance, a burglary every couple of days but we can only prove 2. When in court he is sentenced to prison for a year for the 2 proved, and surprisingly there are no more burglaries in that area for that year. He's released and the cycle starts again.

Of course this simplifies things and it would be wrong to convict people of crimes with no evidence, but it's something to think about.

true,DrunkenTypist,eng-devon,The Mild West,"This is a good question and one that I find difficult to answer. This is not because I am a dishonest person who likes to steal stuff (at least I hope not). 

As someone of a certain age the idea of paying for television (and this is principally what I watch - I very rarely pirate films) is just alien to me. I should say that most of this is USA tv series that are either shown miles out of date here or given terrible/irregular timeslots. Also when I 'steal' several episodes of a series it is pretty much nailed on that I will be going out and buying the box set. 

I was working nights for much of the time that programmes like Oz, The Wire, The Sopranos were on and I brought dvds of all of these. I have watched Breaking Bad, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones online/torrent and I dare say I will get a box set of these.

As far as films go - I do torrent a few European films, they are not shown here because the cinema cartels don't give anything other than Hollywood blockbuster crap screentime etc. Some I go on to buy - the rest I don't in the same way I don't buy every film I watch over here.

Looking at what I wrote it seems I would have to have a total inner cultural change - and that ain't going to happen.

Edit to add - when Twin Peaks was first on, I watched it and recorded it on VHS. I have subsequently bought this on dvd.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The trick is to read your own link and not just the headline.  It is an article with one ambassador saying that Norway using its right of veto *could* spark a *discussion* on the future of the EEA, not Norway's position in it.  Nobody threatened Norway's exclusion.  Nobody.

           ""A serious question that will be raised is whether
            the EU can accept that a non-member nation,
            that fully participates in the inner market, shall
            have a privilege that member nations do not have,"" 

YEAH, they should ask that question.  It's also *the* golden reason why the EEA is exactly where the smart people should be!  The article also says, *""Westerlund emphasized that he sees this discussion as highly hypothetical.""*  As in the ambassador is backing up exactly what I've just said and admits that the EU will do nothing about it because that's exactly the deal Norway and other EEA members signed up to! 

The point remains that whilst there is an EEA that's where the smart countries are; making the most of the advantages with very few of the disadvantages.

&gt;As for selective application of EU law, that's exactly what is not supposed to happen. 

Apparently the ambassador and the chess grandmaster who wrote the article, and the Joint Committee all disagree with you.

&gt;Tons of additional bureaucracy, as if we hadn't enough.

Norway pays for its part in the EEA and the cost of all the bureaucracy already it's just a fraction of what EU members pay to the EU as a whole, but if you are going to provide a pro-EU argument being in the EU to cut down on bureaucracy isn't really going to be a strong flank!  Norway has by far and away much less bureaucracy because it's part of the EEA and not part of the EU.  Another reason to be in the EEA not the EU.

What you have just done is shown and linked to an example of Norway looking at a directive and flexing real muscle with an EU ambassador acknowledging that Norway, as an EEA member, actually has greater privilege and control than full EU members in this regard!

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Needless penalty, maybe, but it was also embellished and he was on the receiving end of the exact same shove before he shoved the QPR player. So I'm not willing to fully blame him for this one, despite admitting that he can give some rash penalties.

I know, there definitely was embellishment but the ref gave the foul against him which is what matters in the end. And it's not the first time either, he conceded a penalty against Fulham last season as well which Cech did save. And I wouldn't be surprised one bit if he concedes more penalties this season. He makes challenges he can't win regularly which costs us at times, if he can cut that out, I'd be perfectly happy for him to start every game alongside JT. 

&gt;Disagree. Mikel there allows Luiz, Bosingwa and Cole get forward with regularity. Luiz there would restrict the full-backs.

You're right, Mikel provides excellent cover in our attacking phase, but when the other team is in and around our penalty area, I feel iffy with Luiz as our last line of defence. I'd also consider moving Luiz to RB and Bane in CB. Bosingwa's having a good season but he can't cross for shit and his defensive contribution is also questionable.

&gt;Yes, but same for Torres; he's made some silly mental mistakes too.

True, but Torres has been scoring too and his work rate off the ball is also immense this season, whereas Drogba's looked out of it since he came back from his concussion. I still love Drogba and always will, I just think on current form Anelka should be starting over him (moot now that Drogba's suspended and Torres is back...).

Strange because the other commenter, boq, saying it doesn't happen like that managed to link to a Norwegian article quoting an EU ambassador that explained it happening just like that!

&gt;The veto is not a negotiating tactic or a way of opting out from individual laws. 

That's exactly what it is!  Not a negotiating tactic, although they have wiggle room of interpretation as laid out by terms in Article 7 setting up the responsibilities of the EEA Joint Committee, but a way of opting out on individual directives written in Brussels.  No laws are forced on EEA states.  They also have regular meetings to influence legislation they may be asked to sign up to.  

&gt;The idea that the UK could just veto the law, the EU would implement it and the Internal Market would continue as normal is bizarre and wrong.

Oh it's bizzare but that's what a veto does.  You accept there's a veto.  Are you really expecting people to believe they set up and agreed to a veto that could never use or attain?  They do have a very real veto!  It does exactly what it says on the tin.

&gt;As such, I did answer your question: the UK gets to both influence and vote on trade legislation.

So you're going to argue that for a split 8% of the vote, and all four major UK MEP parties vote in different blocs (or don't even have a bloc at all) is a good pay off in comparison to; maintaining control of fishing and agricultural policy and saving on EU CAP and CFP, controlling quotas, able to negotiate trade agreements outside the EU without going through a commissioner, a seat on the WTO, a veto, regular input and still part of the four freedoms?

That doesn't stand up any scrutiny.  Nobody in the right mind would even begin to try and argue that that's even close to being a balanced trade off.  It transparently weighted in the EEA's favour.

But 'No', that still didn't attempt to answer the question.  The question  was what business argument makes the UK leaving the EU look stupid.  You gave a Swiss cheese answer to why it should stay in - not what was asked.  I'll try again:

&gt;a way of allowing students to study abroad easier (Yay if done fairly)

Again, under the EEA people from EEA states as part of the common market have the same freedom of movement as all those from full EU states.  This is an EEA Yay.

&gt;a way of declaring and enforcing key justice principles (Yay)

The ECHR is a piece of Council of Europe legislation, which is not the same thing as the EU Council.  This Yay is for CoE not the EU.

&gt;a way of easing travelling (Yay)

A bit of accidental tautology.  Freedom of persons is one of the Four Freedoms of the EU.  It's also something that EEA members outside the EU get.

&gt;a way of making spending money abroad (and taking forigner's money) easier (Yay in theory, although it turns out this has some nightmarish qualities, so Nay)

I agree with what you've said but then it doesn't get any easier than debit/credit/banker's draft.  I've never met a European shopkeeper that didn't find a way to take my money if I were offering it.

&gt;All in all I'll say yay and take the bad with the good.

It's up to you but just to put it out there, you can take all the yays through the EEA and none of the EU associated nays.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"Luiz has given away careless penalties in the past, but I think it's part of a process of maturation for a defender. I don't think the one given against QPR should be lumped in with the others, he clearly thought he was in for a battle and got duped. Live and learn and I'd expect him to do better next time, but I can't blame him for thinking he could do what he did. All game he tried to play as physical as QPR were playing him, he'd get penalized for it, and QPR wouldn't even be whistled. Tough day for him.

&gt; I feel iffy with Luiz as our last line of defence.

I think what usually happens is Luiz plays the role of stopper, so comes out to make the first tackle, and his partner (Terry) plays sweeper, cleans up anything that gets past Luiz. I don't think he is that last man and sometimes you'll even see Mikel behind Luiz. Luiz has the pace and strength to cut the space of an attacker and slow the attack down. Can't argue that he's given some dodgy penalties as a result of being overaggressive, but I like to think he is getting better/more mature.

Not sure if I said this to you already, but I don't think the solution is to move Luiz to right back. I don't doubt that he'd be great there, but I think a lot of his runs are best when he moves through the middle. To restrict him to a wing would restrict the effectiveness of his surging runs. I'd speculate that he wouldn't be the same attacking player if he was tied to a wing, nor would we be the same team; with Terry/Ivy at CB, there'd be no supporting runs through the middle so we'd only rely on two midfielders to hold it down, as Mikel would be forced back to compensate for Luiz/Cole forward runs. We would just lose attacking options in the middle, without really gaining anything on the wing (well, Luiz is probably better in the final third with crossing/dribbling but not that much better). I think giving more time for Luiz to adapt to English defense is the best thing here, he'll become much better.

Agreed about Torres though. Hate to say it but Drogba needs to rediscover himself, just like Lampard did. Happy to say that it appears quite evident that it was simply a bad patch of form for Lamps at the beginning of the season, not an indication that he's past it.

true,Alex_Plalex,dalek,Dalek,"But that's kind of how it would go, wouldn't it? Especially with his personality? It's typical of getting over some sort of bad experience... first you're just screwed up entirely, then you start to heal but you need something to help you along (in Ten's case, his companions) and then you really start to get over it and start to lose some of that darkness, but something always lingers (in Eleven's case, major guilt and insecurity as to whether he's doing the right thing in the end).

----

Nine was really struggling with the recent trauma, so of course he's going to be a bit bitter. But then he meets Rose, and something about her starts to fix him, and he needs that.

-----

Ten is starting to look at the Time War a little bit more objectively, but still has quite a way to go. He starts to realize the extent of loneliness, particularly after he loses Rose, the girl that was helping him heal his wounds. He's fiercely protective and cares so deeply about so much; he really needs somebody around, but still, everyone leaves him some way or another, often tragically. So he gives up on relationships in general because he feels that he just screws everyone up, but then realizes that he gets weird as fuck when he doesn't have anyone to balance him. All in all, Ten is highly emotional, cares *so much* about everything and everyone, and really feels everything very deeply until he starts having wicked problems with what he's becoming, and this is where Eleven picks up his issues.

----

And then.. to me anyway (YMMV) Eleven is more of a ""fuck it, I am so out of touch with this shit by now I just don't even care, I'm going to wear a goddamn fez."" He's a confident motherfucker.. at least on the outside. He's confident about his abilities, cleverness, and wit. However, although it's not quite as bad as Ten's last days, he has a pretty decently sized god complex, and this sort of lingers and bothers him a lot, so he hides it behind silliness, but also is realizing again how silly everything *really* is. He's also considerably less protective of his companions... whether it's because they've proven they can take care of themselves (Rory/River, anyway) or if he just realized that it's too hard to get as attached as before in the long run, because they do always leave...

I think the fear factor for midnight is a similar (albeit different) one as for the impossible planet; where the monster is largely invisible and passes between people, but you also see a very large part of the human element.  Although I think all three of those episodes were very well written.

You can use force to prevent crime, effect a legal arrest or to protect themselves, another of their property. The issue is it must be *reasonable*.

If someone comes in and attacks you then you are legally entitled to use all necessary force, including deadly force, to neutralise the threat. However the minute that person stops posing a threat you must stop. This means you can not shoot a person in the back as they are leaving, you can not continue to beat them up when they are on the floor, etc.

The stance of the government and courts is the same, however people get confused over certain cases such as Tony Martin or the group in London, however in those situations they went over what was necessary and that is why the ended up in more trouble than the burglar.

In the spirit of honesty from my experience police and defence do not get on very well despite appearances. I will be courteous to a solicitor and perform my job but I don't necessarily agree with the way they do it.

I think this is partly a result of the way our adversarial legal system works. There is not an over-arching desire to reach the truth, it is who can present the best arguments.

Also police will put many hours into a job when they know a person is guilty, a solicitor comes in and (in a lot of cases) they know they are guilty but they have their discussion and then a story is presented in interview which is often a LOB.

Another thing I think creates this situation is the fact that I know of only one instance of a solicitor stating they are [professionally embarrassed](http://babybarista.blogspot.com/2007/02/day-105-week-22-professionally.html) and this includes from colleagues who have bene in a lot longer than I have. I'm sure this should be happening more than it currently does.

At the end of the day we are both fighting different sides of a battle and there will always be animosity between us.

Police do not get any of the money from tickets or fines, however, so there is no incentive on us to issue these and I, at least, am not targeted on how many tickets I issue.

Most officers I know don't really like the traffic side and would rather not issue a ticket (there are, of course, those that love it) however some people just seem very keen to talk themselves into a ticket!

I'll give you an example. There was a man sitting in a car holding a knife to himself and pushing it against his chest threatening to kill himself. He was tased and told to release the knife, he did not do so and tried to stab himself again so he was tased again.

Is it better to do it this way from a distance or for officers to jump in mob handed and try and pull the knife away, increasing the risk that they or the man get cut or seriously injured?

As much as some people don't like it police can legally use force to enforce compliance with legal requirements, and if people don't comply they could get tased. I don't agree with tasing people for stupid reasons, for example the traffic stop video that goes around, but I think taser is useful for limiting risk to everyone.

Who said they would?  Many of the directives make perfect sense.  If however one crops up that doesn't fit well or compromises the UK it'd be in a position to (a) firstly negotiate through the JC, (b) hold it open to interpretation, and (c) veto as a final option.

EU countries don't have that.  The UK currently only has a split 8% vote, the commission writes all legislation, and if a directive passes with the 4 main UK voting blocs split 4 ways, it is accepted.

&gt;In such an instant it is in the hands of the EU Commission, according to article 102 of the EEA agreement, to suspend the part of the agreement that the vetoed legislation falls under, which in return goes against the overall aim of the agreement to insure legal homogeneity on the internal market. Vetoing EU legislation could therefore lead to snowballing efect resulting in the dissolving of the agreement â not only for the individual state but also for their two other EFTA partners in the EEA (Eriksen 2008).

&gt;Directly because of this suicidal effect built into the agreement the  veto right has never been used. Once the Commission did, however, start the process. That was in 2002 when Liechtenstein voiced reservations regarding a new legislation on money laundering. An agreement on the issue was subsequently made in good time before any further consequences (Tengsl Ãslandsâ¦ 2007: 33-34). This formal veto right can be compared to the Atom Bomb in the way that it might be effective to hold but not very beneficial for anyone touse it.

Countries within the EEA have very limited negotiation and little opportunity to influence legislation. The idea of vetoing and picking-and-choosing legislation is simply not what happens.

There is legitimate criticism over the CAP (although there are upsides to stable agriculture output that tend to be taken for granted, and its budget is dropping). The CFP is a rounding error. There is little benefit to having a seat in the WTO when we're part of the internal market with common goals (and, of course, number of seats is less important than impact). I'm suprised you didn't mention the cohesion policy which is generally more contentious than the other issues.

It's also far from clear that the EU would let the UK join the EEA. The EEA is a historical abberation, and it's pretty reasonable to assume that the block of 27 countries doesn't want to be held to random by the UK.

The knife/self harm example could have been a very good use of a taser, depending on the circumstances of the case, which the officers on scene have to call for themselves. 

As for compliance in situations which do not pose a serious risk, it is not clear to me from your reply where you draw the line. You say ""police can legally use force to enforce compliance with legal requirements, and if people don't comply they could get tased. I don't agree with tasing people for stupid reasons..."" 

My anxiety is that the temptation of a stand-off weapon like a taser will over time erode policing by consent. You rightly say that asps or sprays have risks to those other than the target. Tasers are advertised as being safe all round (certainly to the officer and bystanders, whatever your position on taser related deaths). Where in the past an officer might decide, for example, to take the time to think and talk, might they think in future 'fuck this, taser him, job done.' I am not talking about now maybe, but as time breeds familiarity and familiarity breeds, if not contempt, then at least a loss of respect for the original function of the tool.

&gt;As EEA acts are only legally binding after they have been implemented by the Icelandic parliament, it can be concluded that Iceland holds a formal veto power over EU laws. It has however increasingly become evident that the EFTA/EEA states cannot refuse EU legislation without threatening the whole cooperation.

You then go on to say they have limited negotiation...*right after the paper yourself quoted it as being an Atom Bomb nobody wants to see go off and little Liechtenstein negotiated an agreement!*

So, again, they have input, they have room for interpretation, and then they have the Atom Bomb threat that nobody wants to see go off - going on the massive assumption that it would go off.  Nobody's remotely trying to argue that they'd use the veto willy-nilly.  As it stands the UK has negligible input into directives as it is.  Conservatives have 26 seats, UKIP/Labour 13 and Lib Dems 12, and they don't have the Nuke option.

There is no picking and choosing directives as it is.  Everybody accepts that directives are passed on a quid pro quo.  Nobody is suggesting that the EEA simply get to pickand choose either, they do however have room for interpretation, it does have to go through a second line of defence in that it has to be passed in Parliament so there is a safeguard.  Simply put it makes the country safer and Europe certainly doesn't want to see the UK kicked out of the EEA, or the EEA itself collapse, so let's not spend too much time on flights of fancy.

&gt;There is legitimate criticism over the CAP (although there are upsides to stable agriculture output that tend to be taken for granted, and its budget is dropping). 

Damn right there is.  It's set up to work for German and French style agriculture which is nothing like the British model.  British farmers receive a truly raw deal.

&gt;The CFP is a rounding error. 

The CFP is killing the fishing stocks and quotas set are culpable for massive waste hitting a major British industry hard.

&gt;There is little benefit to having a seat in the WTO when we're part of the internal market (and, of course, number of seats is less important than impact).

Having a UK voice at the WTO for a start, and the UK is uniquely placed with its position in the Commonwealth to actually wield real influence in forwarding the function of the organisation.  

&gt;I'm suprised you didn't mention the cohesion policy which is generally more contentious than the other issues.

It's six of one and half a dozen of the other as far as I'm concerned.  I'd far rather the UK directly develop Wales, Commonwealth ties and have money left over for the deficit but I'm far more concerned with British industries suffering under the common policies.

&gt;It's also far from clear that the EU would let the UK join the EEA. 

If the British people were to be allowed a referendum Europe wouldn't want to lose UK trade anymore than the UK would want to lose EU trade, and the EU certainly wouldn't want to lose out on UK contributions to the common market either which the UK would still have to pay, just saving the country billions.  To suggest the EU wouldn't allow the UK to join the EEA is scaremongery.  That the EU would attempt to manipulate the UK in such a way is reason itself why the UK should hit the European brake in what would then be clearly an abusive relationship.

&gt;The EEA is a historical abberation, and it's pretty reasonable to assume that the block of 27 countries doesn't want to be held to random by the UK.

And again, why would the UK want to hold them to ransom?  It's only laws that apply to the common market and consumer rights and the such.  We're not even talking massive policy shifts or things in which the UK should not be setting bar in already.  With greater autonomy it should be able to set the bar even higher.

&gt;In short, we're going to agree to disagree, because we're going around in circles.

&gt;&gt; I think the biggest issue is irresponsible drink prices, especially around student bars (Sorry students!). Another issue is that when people do something due to being fuelled by alcohol there should be more ability to prevent them being drunk in public or causing a nuisance.


I'm dubious on the drink prices argument, as its pretty expensive already. If you head to Berlin where 500ML of bottled beers costs ~50p, these problems with violent drunks is almost unheard of. Its very much a British problem and political systems neglect on education on this subject.

In Germany and France there is a culture of raising teenagers with drinking alcohol around the table with there parents, on the other hand - over here, there is so such thing and we can see what problems occur because of it. I'd like to note that people in Germany get equally as drunk, but there is no of the violence (in most cases) - its a very strange UK phenomena IMHO.

They are a good example because exports are very important to them.

Now look at their net revenue by market in 2010:

* UK:  911 million
* Germany: 853 million
* Spain: 594 million
* Rest of EU: 1577 million
* Americas: 780 million
* Rest of the world: 2340 million

You will notice that the total exports to EU countries is over 3 billion pounds or about 43% of net revenue worldwide. That should illustrate why it is a pretty bad idea to 'fuck the French' as you suggest. The EU is a critically important market for British companies.

If the EU countries decided to fuck you right back (consumer boycott of UK products or raising tariffs to the point that it is not profitable for UK companies to do business in the EU) then a company like Imperial Tobacco would need to double sales in the rest of the world in order to make up for the loss of the EU market.

It is also worth considering that tourism accounts for about 1 in 12 jobs in the UK economy, contributing around 100 billion pounds.

It'll honestly be the biggest shame to see him go. I was kinda hoping that he'd do a really long stint or something - we've seen him get settled, we've seen him being manipulative of even his own friends to get his way, we're about to see him lie low - I'd've loved to see him culminate all of that to do something massive that would change the entire universe - something perhaps not as big as locking up Gallifrey, but paradigm-changing enough. His character seems to have the potential to do such destructive things.

Firstly, you think that everybody is all right, and it's a relief, until you hear the four knocks, and it takes a while to dawn on you the full meaning of what has happened.  Wilfred's trapped himself in the glass thing and it is going to spell the doctor's doom.  Yeah Wilf was a silly old man, but I feel so, so sorry for him too.  Poor guy, especially sad when he was in the box pleading for the doctor to let him die :(  It was a classical tragedy - you knew that the doctor had to die to save Wilfred (or that Wilfred would die, though the doctor could never let that happen).

Anyway, the placebo music that dude added also kinda affects the emotion.

true,p1m,null,null,"I can't speak to what goes on in police stations as I don't do them (only court work), but at least from my point of view, I don't know if a person is guilty unless they tell me they are. At which point I would absolutely be professionally embarrassed if they wanted to continue to plead not guilty and I would (and have) withdraw from the case. When the evidence is really strong or someone's defense is rubbish, I tell them, and strongly advise them to plead guilty. It's my duty to do that. We have no interest in continuing with pointless not guilty pleas - our duty is to the client and if they are going to be convicted, then it is better for them to plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. If they are very obviously guilty then it's also helpful if we can honestly say, in mitigation, that not only did they plead guilty but they were honest with the police. 

But at the same time it's up to you guys and the CPS to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, for very good reasons, so if you can't do it, then the defendant should be acquitted. If you have all the evidence and the CPS presents it properly then that's fine, but if there is weak or flawed evidence or the prosecution case is messed up, so that you can't prove it so that the magistrates or jury are sure, then the person is still innocent until proven guilty. 

If the story is a LOB (and if the person doesn't admit guilt but maintains their LOB, despite the best advice we have to continue to represent them on their instructions), a jury or bench will detect it a mile away and convict the person. Remember, the rate of conviction in the magistrates court is (as I understand it) over 90%. 

The purpose of my job is to act as an advocate for the accused person, to act for the best interests of that person, and to ensure that they have a fair trial, no matter who they are.

Now has either less homes to sell at market rates which pushes up the price of the remaining flats, or has to subsidise a second development elsewhere and recover that cost from the other flats being sold to the open market.

Homes sold to buyers go for Â£280,000 instead.

Person down the road owns an older home worth Â£250,000 sees that equivalent newer properties are selling for Â£280,000 and decides to sell their home - for Â£280,000.

The net effect is that the requirement for new home builds to subsidise low-cost housing was a massive transfer of wealth from new home owners to the existing home owners as an artificial house price boom was created by a planning requirement for low-cost housing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm a pretty big fan of Mikel. I think he took awhile to really settle in, and up until the last 1-2 season was really just a squad player, but he played a big part in the team last year even when things weren't going well. Our win percentage with Mikel in the squad was pretty impressive IRC. I think he plays a necessary role in the squad too, and he plays it very well. He is very good at retaining the ball and rarely misplaces a pass. His pass completion % is extremely impressive, and while people say its because he is a DM and only plays sideways passes, well...there are many DM's in the league who play short low risk passes, but he does it better than almost all of them. 

With that being said I still think Mikel has not reached his potential yet and I will always have a desire to see him reach new heights. IMO Mikel has the potential to be a midfield BOSS. I would like to see him win more balls in the midfield, win more in the air, and just own the midfield a little more. I think he has what it takes to do so, but I also don't discredit him because I believe in his position this takes time and loads of experience. 

I was disappointed with his first half performance against QPR, but thought he did will to cover for cole, luiz, and terry, and brana who were all pushing forward in the second half. Other than that his performances this season and last have been  mostly solid.

QPR are extremely poor at defending set pieces. With Mata's delivery, and Ivanovic and Drogba on the field, Chelsea could have had real joy with aerial attacks. Drogba's needless sending off and Mata's subsequent substituation put paid to that. It was interesting to see Mikel go up to Drogba as he walked off and get 'shhh-ed'. I reckon he was telling him that as an experienced pro he'd let his team-mates down there.

What I'm trying to say is that the difference in discipline between the two teams wasn't that one was dirty and the other wasn't - it's that QPR were clever and Chelsea weren't.

As for recommendations on other things to watch, the recent BBC Sherlock series is pretty good (not sure how far they are going to take the characters' depths though), and maybe Life on Mars/Ashes to Ashes. In terms of characters and moral ambiguities, I enjoyed [Regenesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReGenesis) - the Canadian sci-fi/sci-factual series - that had characters with back-stories and the plots often had questions over ethics and morality.

We played to the level of our opposition, and lost major points against teams battling relegation.  It was ridiculous.

So far this season that's not happening.  We have two losses against the best teams in the league, one draw against a very in-form side playing at home, and otherwise it's big fat W's all the way, including against Liverpool and Arsenal - our main rivals, I think everyone would agree, for the fourth-place spot.  That's how a team needs to play if they want to qualify for the Champions League in the Prem.  If we keep beating the sides we *should* beat and losing only to powerhouses, we've got this locked up.

That, of course, would be too much to ask for - everyone's going to drop some points somewhere.

It's likely they can regenerate any time but few Time Lords would ""waste"" a regeneration purely for cosmetic reasons.  As for Romana, she repeatedly goes in and out of the console room to perform her transformations; it seems likely that she would use the Zero Room to do so given that the Fifth Doctor sought out the same room to help stabilize his new regeneration.

Perhaps regenerating is a skill, and one that the Doctor just sucks at. One feature of Romana that I loved is that she was so much smarter than the doctor when it came to Time Lord technology and information. Maybe she's just more skillful at regenerating than him.

Anyway, the fact that she was able to change so frequently and easily, zero room or no, plus River's comment (""I'm focusing on a dress size!""), and the Master's comment (""I can become young, too!"") lead me to think that they do have more control than we think over their regenerations, and 3rd doc could have planned 4th doc in advance, ""all teeth and hair.""",0,1319570129,null,0,false,0,c2udnqy,t3_lob8l,t1_c2udnqy,t1_c2ud8se,1427781824,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Unfortunately, the proceeds finance an awful lot of real criminality, and the sheer fact that people have to deal with criminals &amp; gangsters to get the drugs leads to other crime being inflicted upon them.

Then there are issues with purity.  It's a fact that most deaths from heroin occur because there is no simple way for the user to know how strong the stuff he or she takes is.  (Incidently, it is possible to take heroin in significant amounts for ten years, stop, and suffer no long term effects.  The same is manifestly not true in regard to alcohol.  of course, given the illegality of heroin, it's very likely that a user over the course of a decade will overdose.  If they knew what they were taking, that would not happen.)

And then of course, there is all that lost taxation.  Taxing and selling cannabis would make an awful lot of money for an awful lot of hospitals.

I have however learned a bit since then, and 1: missed Doc Who, and 2:forced myself to give MS a chance. After making myself watch an episode or two I thought it was pretty great. 

Something that helps is something I read. Eccelston's Doctor was rather...gruff...and angry. 9 was after the war, so he was still in the military type state of mind. He was very angry and lonely and a sad sort of man who had more or less forgotten his love of humans and other races. 9 had to figure out what life was like again. 10 was after 9's gruffness...he was older and more mature in a sense. 9 sort of threw a yearlong temper tantrum I suppose you could say. 10, being older, began learning more and becoming more compassionate. 10 is such a wonderful Doctor because he had the balance of compassion, passion, and anger just right. He was so passionate about certain things. 11 comes along and 11 is becoming old, yet adventurous. 11 shows that the Doctor sort of realized his life is short and that you need to have some fun. 9 runs, 10 defends, and 11 does everything he possibly can. 

Have your friend read that, and remind him/her that no matter what, its still the Doctor. Matt Smith is just a different version of the same character. The passion and adventure still exists, just in a different body.

Don Draper isn't fucking Don Draper.  Don Draper is fucking every other character on the show... except Don Draper.  And except Peggy.

I agree that there is a parallel to the dependency between Amy/Doctor and Peggy/Don, but it's entirely different in its character.  The intertwinement between the Doctor and Amy is fairly complete.  We really can't imagine Amy becoming Amy independent of the Doctor. 

Peggy will most likely eventually become a female version of Don.

Actually, I was originally thinking that Sara Jane and Jack both made better analogues to that particular trajectory.  But then, I forgot about Future Amy.  I forgot to consider that Amy does somewhat come surprisingly close to the Doctor's stature in her role during TWORS.  Yet even then, River comes yet closer to that trajectory than Amy.  So if we are forced to choose only one character to represent Peggy... except it can't be River because Don never sleeps with Peggy (and presumably never will).  

I keep coming back to Sarah Jane.  Or possibly Martha.  Both of them assume the Doctor's role in a very tangible way, and actually I'm pretty sure that their sexual tension with the Doctor was much more similar to that between Peggy and Don.

At All. 

Not. One. Bit.

I have no problems with the man who played him, nor the writers who wrote for him, nor those who played alongside him.

What has really turned me off the 10^th Doctor is his nasty, vicious, rabid fans, and their horrible, aggressive attitude towards both Matt Smith and the current incarnation of the show.

I have never been more disgusted with Doctor Who 'fandom' than when the 'Let's Kill Matt Smith!!!!111!!' pages began popping up on facebook and the like. It was a savage low-point for a series that at the time had had *nine other people* play the role of the Doctor.

Doctor Who has been around for nearly 50 years and has thrived off the notion that the show is *bigger* than the man who plays the lead role. Right now it is occupied by Matt Smith, who so far has done an *outstanding* job playing the Doctor. Eventually he'll leave, and a new actor will take up the part. That is just how the show works.

It's time for some people to gain a sense of perspective and move on.

The origin of the terms are the seating arrangements in the French National Assembly, where supporters of the State/King/religion sat to the right and those of the revolution to the left.  After the revolution, agitators for change (mostly liberals representing the evolving enlightenment middle classes against propertied and landed aristocratic interests) sat to the left, and conservative constitutionalists to the right. Back then, of course, there wasn't really a socialist left, which came later and initially sat on the left with the liberal progressives representing the working people.  The grand schism on the far left is represented in the spat between Proudhon and Marx, and more generally between the libertarian and State socialists, but in the wake of the Russian revolution when the Bolsheviks defeated the anarchists/libertarians both ideologically* and ultimately militarily (and killed many during Stalin's purges), the libertarian strand of socialism waned until the point of almost disappearing during the last century (though it revived somewhat during the sixties for a while).

So anyway, apologies for the history lesson, but I just wanted to point up that hard or extreme left doesn't really necessitate State ownership of everything, since that's only one strand of left (State socialism), it just happens to be the dominant form in the world today.  Libertarian socialists would see themselves as equally hard left (certainly the anarcho-syndicalists and anarcho-communists), although Marx derided us (and especially us mutualists) as petty bourgeoisie, desiring a nation of self-employed shopkeepers.

Yawn.

&gt;**The Color of Crime**

&gt;**Race, Crime, and Justice in America 
Second, Expanded Edition, 2005**

&gt;**Major Findings:**

&gt;**Police and the justice system are not biased against minorities.**

&gt;**Crime Rates**

&gt;Blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder, and eight times more likely to commit robbery.

&gt;When blacks commit crimes of violence, they are nearly three times more likely than non-blacks to use a gun, and more than twice as likely to use a knife.

&gt;Hispanics commit violent crimes at roughly three times the white rate, and Asians commit violent crimes at about one quarter the white rate.

&gt;The single best indicator of violent crime levels in an area is the percentage of the population that is black and Hispanic.

&gt;**Interracial Crime**

&gt;Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving blacks and whites, blacks commit 85 percent and whites commit 15 percent.

&gt;Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. Forty-five percent of their victims are white, 43 percent are black, and 10 percent are Hispanic. When whites commit violent crime, only three percent of their victims are black.

&gt;Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a white than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery.

&gt;Blacks are 2.25 times more likely to commit officially-designated hate crimes against whites than vice versa.

&gt;**Gangs**

&gt;Only 10 percent of youth gang members are white.

&gt;Hispanics are 19 times more likely than whites to be members of youth gangs. Blacks are 15 times more likely, and Asians are nine times more likely.

&gt;**Incarceration**

&gt;Between 1980 and 2003 the US incarceration rate more than tripled, from 139 to 482 per 100,000, and the number of prisoners increased from 320,000 to 1.39 million.

&gt;Blacks are seven times more likely to be in prison than whites. Hispanics are three times more likely.

That's probably true, but on the flip side, there's the possibility more people will start using it and potentially become unproductive, non-revenue generating members of society. I'm a weed smoker, I like weed, but there's no denying it makes many people less productive.

The ""problem"" with drugs is that for many of them, there's no incentive not to use them, other than the fact that they're illegal/expensive/hard to get hold of. Whereas with booze you get a God awful hangover which limits your intake, there's no such problem with many illegal drugs (admittedly taking ecstasy or speed five nights a week wouldn't make you feel too hot, but people do it). We keep them illegal to limit people's use.

You only need to look at the amount of antidepressants prescribed these days to see how people want to be altered (not dissing depression or antidepressants, btw - been there, done that, for six years); if relatively risk-free drugs are legal there's the very definite danger people will be high much of the time, limiting their ability to do their jobs.",0,1319618803,null,0,false,0,c2uk0l3,t3_lomsk,t1_c2uk0l3,t1_c2ue2wn,1427784889,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,JimmySinner,null,null,"This is by no means comprehensive, and is probably somewhat biased, but here goes.

The two main parties, the Conservative Party and Labour are traditionally right wing and left wing respectively.

Labour were most recently in power from 1997 to 2010 and during that time became increasingly right wing on social matters. 9/11 had a lot to do with that. Concerns over terrorism led them to introduce policies such as raising the length of time people could be detained without charge, 'stop &amp; search' laws, compulsory ID cards and an identity database containing genetic information, eye scans, fingerprints, etc. They also became increasingly right wing on economic matters, supporting the free market and so on. Following their election loss last year they've elected a new leader, Ed Miliband, whose philosophy is closer to that of traditional Labour than the previous regime. He is bringing them back towards the centre, but probably not all that much.

The Conservatives are often referred to as the Tory Party. Essentially, that was their name from the 1600s to the 1800s. They're traditionally centre right, both economically and socially, but their position now is closer to the centre in their social policy. They've scrapped the ID cards and identity register, they're introducing new building regulations with less red tape, and so on. Their financial politics remain fairly right wing.

The third largest party, the Liberal Democrats, are traditionally a centrist party. Their social policies are more libertarian than Labour and the Tories, and while they still support the free market they do so with the caveat of tighter regulation. After the 2010 election, in which they won a lot of votes from traditional Labour voters, they formed a coalition with the Conservative Party to govern. Their leader, Nick Clegg, serves as Deputy Prime Minister. As the minority coalition partner they're pretty much bound into following closer to the Tory Party line. I'm actually an economically centre-right libertarian Lib Dem supporter so this suits me fairly well (I think it's better than an outright Conservative government, even if they were a ruling minority) but an overwhelming majority of Lib Dem voters feel betrayed, and understandably so.

The Greens have expanded from essentially being a single-issue party and done a pretty good job of it. They're far more left wing both socially and economically than the other parties, but they're not extremists by any means. They've benefited greatly from the fact that Labour and the Lib Dems have both gradually been moving further to the right over the past thirty years or so, and in that England and Wales have no real significant Socialist party any more. That's left them a good pool of disaffected former Labour voters and so on.

Other than that, a handful of seats are held by the following:

Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru ('Party of Wales') who are both centre-left nationalists.

Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the DUP, all from Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein are an Irish Republican party associated with the IRA. They don't actually take their seats in parliament. The Social &amp; Democratic Labour Party are another Irish Republican party, but more liberal than Sinn Fein. Unlike the other two, the Democratic Unionist Party are pro-UK, unfortunately they're also creationist homophobic nutjobs. Frankly I don't know all that much about the Northen Irish parties, but I get the overall impression that they're all dicks.

Apart from the DUP, all of those regional parties want independence from the UK.

They are a couple of independent/local party MPs as well, but I couldn't really tell you anything about them anyway.

Oh, and then there's one Respect MP. They're a Socialist party but they're a complete joke. Their most famous member is an ex-Labour member who was kicked out of the party and is now best known for appearing on Big Brother and embarrassing the utter shit out of himself.",0,1319619077,null,0,false,0,c2uk14u,t3_lp4hr,t1_c2uk14u,t3_lp4hr,1428185597,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Right now there's dismissal and there is redundancy.

In order to make someone redundant you have to be able to show the position they are in isn't there any more.

This document proposes that you can do compensated dismissal and the employee can't pursue for unfair dismissal.

So you can dismiss someone and pay them redundancy, and that's them off your books and you can hire someone else.

That's much different than I imagined and my previous comments spoke about and now I'm not sure if it's such a bad thing... 

Edit : To be clear I'm not saying it's a good thing, I'm just less worried about it because employers would have to pay redundancy to use it. 

I think it'd have two effects

1) Lazy employees would get a redundancy payout to avoid the prospect of a tribunal, where previously they would be dismissed

As a woman it annoys me to no end when people get bitter about women having maternity rights and blame them for using them. 

Solution:

1. Give men and women equal rights, and each couple can share out leave allowances etc. If men had the same rights it wouldn't be seen as an 'abuse' when people use them.

2. Government should subsidise the costs for small businesses.

Practically, to dismiss me for being unproductive, my line manager would have to check on what I'm doing daily, and prepare reports covering it, and showing why I could have done more.

It's hassle, yes, but I don't see why it should be easy to just get rid of someone.

true,widgetas,null,null,"In case there's confusion - Schools in England and Wales are required by law to have children attend a daily act of worship of a primarily Christian nature. It so happens that most schools include something like a hymn or two in their assemblies, but many do not even bother with that. However, it still stands that it is the law.

Parents can choose to have their child removed from the religious part of the assembly, but this often means that their child is absent for the whole shebang, as not many schools will have a child leave and/or come back in after the religious bit is over with. Not many parents like to have their child so obviously 'different' to the other children too. When you hit 16 you can choose for yourself if you're going to sit through it. [edit - The NSS won this change to the law in 2006]

Most people will say, unless they went to a Catholic school or similar, ""What? We never had to do daily worship."" and maybe ""Why do the NSS want to stop assemblies?"" It seems that near to no schools (excluding particular types of faith school) actually do a full on religious worship everyday, though it's likely they do hymns of some kind at every assembly (mine did). The NSS is only trying to have the religious worship aspect of the law dropped. Personally I find it an affront to children everywhere that a school would *teach* them a religion. It should be a home/private affair, with religious education in a school providing an overview to as many religious beliefs or philosophies rather than one particular faith.

How many people, who never had a religion or don't now, can say that even at the age of 11 they were content with effectively being told to pray? I didn't know I had the option not to, or that I didn't *have* to until I was out of school, though I never actually bowed my head or similar. I always thought I was going to get into trouble. 

If anyone is interested in the kind of barriers parents can face when they try and remove their child from collective worship, Dr Anton Lempert gave a short presentation at the NSS Confernce on Secularism back in September.

true,lackofbrain,cnty-uk,Nowhere in particular,"Hope to achieve? I don't really know. Many people have many different views on what should happen. However there is a general consensus that things need to change. 

Protesting against: unfairness, essentially. The current corporatist system is seen as generally unfair what with, as others have pointed out, bank bailouts and huge bonuses, the largest gap between rich and poor in the developed world being in London, and all trends suggesting that will just get bigger over time, and a myriad of other similar problems. 

It isn't a simple question with a simple answer. While many of those involved are anti-capitalist the solutions don't necessarily need to be. But there does need to be *some* sort of solution, and the only people offering any at the moment are the anti-capitalists, and George Osbourne (and the latter's solution seems to be to give more money to the people responsible in the first place!) 

However it is worth noting that not having a simple answer does not invalidate the problem. 

**Let's take an analogy:** your leg is trapped under a rock too heavy for you to lift. Someone yells ""dynamite the rock"", someone else calls for you to ""cut off your leg"", while yet another person tells you to simply ""forget your leg ever existed and walk away"". These are all obviously stupid so you ask some other people - one person says you should roll the rock away, but they want to roll it over your other leg, while another says you should roll the rock exactly the other way but that is up a very steep hill and you have no leverage. Neither of these is exactly a reasonable solution either. Someone says he knows a guy with a crane who will lift the rock off for fifty million quid, and another guy butts in saying his mate will do it for thirty million, and the rights to your legs in perpetuity. By this point, due to the myriad of stupid suggestions, pain and blood-loss you decide to accept the offer of the flying pink elephant to carry the boulder away, and then you pass out. None of these actually solve the problem but that doesn't mean your crushed leg is not still trapped. It's very much like that only with less legs and boulders.

WWII is America's Great Patriotic War. It's the last war on which most of me can agree. Every war more recent is considered meaningless by some significant number of people. In order to form a more perfect union, we do tend to over-emphasize the importance of our role, especially on the continent.

It is my sincere hope that through repeated playings of first person shooters featuring the fall of Berlin to the USSR, my constitutive parts will better understand our role in WWII.

true,zodin,null,null,"The short answer is: it changes. 


Initially the Doctor meets The Time Lords in The War Games and they appear in the Three Doctors and Genesis of the Daleks and a couple of others. They're very mysterious and spooky and don't have names and are essentially a kind of super-bureaucracy and they're all Time Lords. 


Then The Deadly Assassin comes along and changes all that, the Time Lords we've seen before are actually members of the Celestial Intervention Agency, and most Time Lords are more like University Professors than anything else and they have names like Runcible and Borusa. This Gallifrey has guards who are like campus security and ""Shobogans"" who are sort of like rowdy students. The Invasion of Time crystallises this into what became the Gallifrey society for the rest of the seventies and eighties: it's a post-scarcity society where politics are everything, the houses stop being like School Houses and are more like the French ""Estates"", with different roles. There are also people who live Outside the Dome and are Neo-primitives. Time Lords are either boring and set in their ways, evil and want Power for it's own sake, or renegades who want to adventure. The rest of Gallifrey aren't really seen, and apart from the guards, don't really exist.      


The nineties New Adventures books took this to the Nth degree making the Houses sentient actual houses and whoever came from them was born into a certain role (House Patrexes were crazy super-artists in Damaged Goods by some guy called Russell T Davis), working their way up to become a Lord (Andred from the Invasion of Time become a Time Lord).


Then after the McGann Telemovie someone figured out that they'd been calling the outsiders Shobogans, and that Borusa had been flip-flopping from good to evil too much and the whole thing didn't make sense any more; and that's when they started the first Time War story arc. Suddenly Gallifrey had a huge underclass who were starting a rebellion, and just as suddenly they were a militaristic dictatorship run by Romana. 


It works on the principle that any inconsistency from previous stories is an effect of the Time War; there's a great bit in one book where a scene is being described and the architecture changes, at first you think it's sloppy writing, then you cotton on that the history of Gallifrey is being changed as the scene takes place. 


Note: this is the Time War from the Eighth Doctor Books, which is different to the Time War in the Big Finish Audios, which is different to the Time War from the RTD era... Or is it???


So, in answer to your question. Yes, no, and everything in between. Every answer you get will be ""correct"". Probably the most important thing to remember is this: they're stories by different authors at different times - this is Doctor Who, there is no cannon - what Robert Holmes needed the Time Lords to be in 1977 is different to what Terrence Dicks needed them to be in 1983, which is different to what Russell T Davis needed them to be in 1996, which is different to what he needed them to be in 2009.",0,1319640330,null,0,true,0,c2ulnkl,t3_lohp7,t1_c2ulnkl,t3_lohp7,1427785660,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

In terms of the penalty, Luiz made a clumsy and seemingly needless challenge on Helguson, which the ref called as a foul. Hence the penalty.

true,Crabalicious,null,null,"As I just said, I believe the point is that it's an effective way of limiting the number of people that ingest substances, and in doing that it's undoubtedly effective. The reason *why* we shouldn't want people taking drugs - if that is what we want at all - is the more interesting question to me.

The fact that there are two legal, regularly taken drugs that have not destroyed society is no evidence at all that legalising a bunch of others would not do harm to the general populace and its ability to continue to be a productive, economy sustaining workforce. Quite the opposite, in my opinion; alcohol-related deaths far outnumber drug-related deaths precisely because there are so many more people drinking alcohol because it's legal to do so. I strongly suspect if you legalise drugs, there would be an increase in the number of drug-related deaths since the number of people using drugs would increase, since illegality is clearly a deterrent to some people. I don't say this as a scare tactic, it's a fact - we simply don't know what the implications for society would be if we legalised and regulated all drugs. We'd have to do it to find out.

I also disagree with your analysis of most people who get high since it doesn't tally with my experience (though of course I accept ymmv). Between the ages of about 14 and my mid-to-late twenties, I took drugs a lot. Most weekends my friends and I were doing things like coke, MDMA, regular ecstasy, speed, Valium, Xanax, ketamine, LSD, and more recently mephedrone (mainly just to see what the fuss was about). While I was at university I smoked a lot of weed almost every day, and so did most people I knew. It was a way of life for me and many young people who went out clubbing a couple of times a week, and I really don't think I was that unusual amongst the people I knew that took drugs; there weren't many people that only did it occasionally for a bit of fun. Sometimes nights out were ruined because we couldn't get anything to swallow to get high (sad but true).

But I feel you're misunderstanding my position. I have absolutely zero interest in criminalising large parts of the population for doing something that mainly affects only them - and when it comes to weed, I don't think there's even a debate to be had. I was prosecuted for possession of cannabis and amphetamine when I was 17 which fortunately didn't affect my life in any significant way, but it easily might've done, which would've been a really stupid outcome resulting from prohibition. I think given the numbers of people taking drugs like mephedrone, and particularly MDMA/ecstasy, we really need to focus on harm reduction through research into the drug's effects on the brain - and even potentially some kind of regulation since the ""war"" is lost.

My issue is with other, more dangerous, addictive drugs, that can clearly seriously damage people's lives, that they often start taking when they're mentally or emotionally vulnerable - drugs like heroin, or crack. I really don't think we should be making those more available.",0,1319644370,null,0,false,0,c2um9ky,t3_lomsk,t1_c2um9ky,t1_c2ulu7j,1427785947,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Don't get me wrong, I'm an advertising copywriter, and very rarely have I done less than a 60 hour week, and very often significantly more. I also know that some agencies would take a very dim view of me sticking to my contracted hours (unless I'm freelancing, in which case they can pay me overtime).

My point is that they still have to justify your laziness, and unreasonable working requests do not fall into that.

It does all depend on how such a relaxation of regulations are implemented. As yet, we don't know what form that would actually take.

A former girlfriend of mine was a team manager at a large company. One day she (a male colleague actually) found a team member of hers, who had been away from his desk for well over an hour, sitting in a toilet cubicle reading a book.

She couldn't even give him a written warning, for two reasons. First, his privacy was invaded by a colleague looking over the cubicle wall. The second was more generic. The warning process was so verbose, and so belt and braces (to prevent a tribunal), that it would have taken her over a week to do it (I won't bore you with the detail).

Your only response was to attack *me*, despite the fact that I've never said anything against *you*. As I mentioned in my other post, that's an ad hominem attack and has no place in logical arguments.

If you want to start whining because some of us take a negative view to your team, then I'd suggest you stay off this subreddit. You didn't come here to take the discussion forward, you came here expecting us to be nice to your club, and we're not. Boo hoo.

But beyond that, guns are (for me, anyway) also fun for their historical value. I have a collection of military weapons to rival many museums, and have been collecting them for over 30 years. I have weapons from the mid 1800s to modern day.  I have bolt actions, semi-autos and full autos.  I have cap and ball black powder guns used in the American Civil War all the way up to belt-fed weapons that get mounted on vehicles.  I even have a few British weapons.

(My favorite among that group is an Enfield used -- as in, actually used -- in WWI. It's got a wood stock that has been wrapped in wire, which was a battlefield modification that allowed it to launch grenades. I look at the soldered-on wire and wonder what was going through the guy's head when he was wrapping it.  I wonder if the guy launching grenades was afraid that the wire would come loose and the stock would splinter and hurt him. Was he resentful for having to carry a rifle that was heavier than it should be? Did the shininess of the wire bother him?)

It's fun and educational to hold/shoot them, take them apart, tinker with them, and generally get to know them.  You know how they sound, how they feel, how they smell, what to do, and what not to do.  You feel a connection with ages gone past, and by extension to the men (and women) who depended on these tools for their very lives.

People seem to think they are being 'tricked' into religion, 'forced to worship' but I don't personally think that is the point. If you are smart enough to build up good morals on your own and be a free-thinker, great! Nothing lost.


If you have a bad background, tough neighborhood, dodgy parents etc. Learning morals through religion in school and knowing there is an organisation that will take the time to listen to your problems, could be a massive benefit.


Reddit is a place where the former category gathers, so I'm not surprised that I've been getting slated for stating the other side of the argument. Can't you be open minded enough to see that some people benefit from these teachings?

Could someone tell me what part of this you are actually mad about? Lot of people just saying 'its bullshit', 'don't try and teach me lies!'- comments like this don't help- what are your issues?


edit: In addition, they at least teach you what religion is all about. In a world were religion is important to a lot of people (if you like it or not, it's a fact), it's very useful to have at least some understanding of what a religion is and how it works. There's no way someone who has been shielded from religion their whole life will have any constructive input in a religious debate.

The point being, for everyone I knew who had a dad at home the dangers of joining a gang or going off the rails was just not there.

The problem, as far as the black community is concerned is lack of real male role models. And I'm not talking footballers and TV stars. The TV stations can throw in as many token black faces as they want, we could have a Us style Obama revolution and elect a black Prime Minister...that stuff is useless and peripheral and I wish people stopped focusing on it (""But, there's not enough black faces in Midsummer Murders."" Oh do fuck off!)

I'm talking in the home, in the classroom face to face. Too many young boys who don't know shit are being raised to be the man of the house by the time they hit 10. When that young boy becomes a young man you tell him something. He isn't going to listen to you. Who are you? He's the man of the house! He's the main breadwinner and the one his younger siblings look up to. He's got it in his head he's an adult and he know better than you.

We, and I mean this as in the black community, need to fix this ourselves...we need to fix the family. There's no social stigma about getting some girl pregnant and running off to do it again. In fact at least back in the day you *had* to run off. I know dude that do it, abandon a family and they don't even leave the street. They're in a tower block within eye view of their first set of kids making a new set.",0,1319653498,null,0,false,0,c2unqgf,t3_lpt6i,t1_c2unqgf,t1_c2uni7c,1427786716,28,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28

I know he's said he wants to play every game, but I'm wondering if fatigue is contributing to his poor finishing of late. Let's not forget that he did go straight from the Copa America into this season with very little rest. 

I just don't want to see him burned out by midseason. We need him too much if we want to make a CL spot. Maybe Kenny is planning on giving him the West Brom game off. Either way, I don't think it would hurt Suarez to give him a week off. 

EDIT: Guess I was wrong. We wouldn't have pulled out the win today without him. Still think he needs a rest, but his two goals were absolute class.

While I think you might be right, I do have to wonder why white single parent teenagers don't end up in legal trouble as much as their non-white counterparts?    

I mean single parent kids of all races and cultures are almost always more likely to be involved in crime, have a teenage pregnancy, or to take drugs. But why is it that non-whites in particular end up in the slammer more?    

Might it be a ""self-fulfilling stereotype"" type situation where the police and courts expect a certain behaviour from certain groups and as a consequence find it more often? And since these groups are going to get constantly harassed when they *aren't* committing crime then what the hell?  

Even if it is down to family breakdown I'm not sure what can be done. Males have been driven almost actively away from children both in literal terms with gender discrimination (teachers, carers) but also by people *assuming* there is something wrong with you if you want to work with or near children.     

Plus with the way our feminised education system works being male is almost seen as a sickness. Competition is outlawed, playing rough is banned, and group bonding is almost actively discouraged.

No, not at all, but if a member feels that they should have the debate on whether or not they should leave the union it seems unfair to me to preclude the other members of that union from being involved. I don't think you'd get a big turnout in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, but I imagine that Scotland would get considerable support from the Welsh and possibly sections of Northern Ireland, as well as some of the English - put it this way, I would vote for Scottish secession if it benefited both England and Scotland. I would vote for English secession if it benefited England (which it most probably would) but we'll never be given the chance.
If any member of the UK has been royally shat on by it's leaders as much as England, it's Scotland. Scotland has pushed for a devolved government, largely driven by the SNP's independence agenda, although they lack the courage of their convictions to call for a referendum until 'the time is right' in case they lose.

In the meantime, England (and Britain as a whole) is blamed for issues that England (no parliament, no assembly of it's own, no political representation and in the last British parliament referred to mainly as 'the regions') has supposedly caused.

At the same time, Labour has tried it's best to force Scottish people into [welfare dependency](http://www.thinkscotland.org/change-scotland/articles.html?read_full=10759), creating a client state, with [murky](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics-news/2010/06/20/cocaine-shame-council-chief-steven-purcell-returns-to-glasgow-86908-22346516/) [links](http://www.glasgowsnp.org/Westminster_Election/Glasgow_East/Murphy_embroiled_in_gangster_scandal_-_Labour_questioned_over_organised_crime_links/) to [organised](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/company-linked-to-purcell-in-700-000-land-deal-with-labour-donor-1.1014924) [crime](http://joanmcalpine.typepad.com/joan_mcalpine/2010/03/purcell-criminality-and-blackmail-what-did-downing-street-know.html).

&gt; You lament the fact that the largest population centre (England, presumably) ""has no voice"". What is Westminster then? Are you seriously claiming that England is not represented?

Yes. That is exactly what I'm claiming. England is represented in the same way that Scotland was represented before devolution, i.e. not at all. There are more English seats in parliament because of the way boundaries are drawn up and the fact that England is geographically bigger, but Westminster represents the UK, and while Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs vote on English issues, the English have to go to Westminster to debate it. Personally I'd like to see full separate Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish and English parliaments, with a greatly shrunken British parliament. The geographical location of Westminster, while not an irrelevance is not the great advantage to England that some might think it is. Consider the screwing over of English students on tuition fees one example, and fox hunting in England versus Scotland as a lesser one.

&gt; So really, if England wanted something it would be impossible for the rest of the UK to prevent it.

But England isn't a coherent single party state. Even this weekend we saw two Euro-friendly and one Euro-schizoid party push through an agenda to avoid a debate on continued European membership that was based on party lines, not state ones. If England as a whole combined together then Scotland would still be able to reject such things in Scotland for the majority of cases (as shown by the whole tuition fee fiasco).

&gt; Yeah, I'm really going to have to ask for a citation here, that sounds rather hard to credit.

Certainly, the [Barnett formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_formula) is a complex mechanism that has been used by Labour in Scotland to feed the Scottish purse, money from which has been used in the award of alleged dodgy contracts, again Stephen Purcell's dodgy land deals are some very public examples. Similarly complex equivalents occur in Northern Ireland, with allegations of party short money being used to fund sectarian crime in the past. The Barnett formula works particularly well for Northern Ireland where it's used to fund social programmes that don't necessarily seem to go anywhere (I don't have links but have had personal experience with this in Belfast in the 90s, although I will accept that it'd be anecdata).

I'm not saying that money doesn't flow from England and Wales to corrupt enterprises, but there are serious problems with Labour in Scotland, and with the Scottish police (just as with the English police as well) and corruption.

The Barnett formula, although it has led to more and less money going to Scotland in the past will once inflation starts to creep up work against Scotland. The very reasoning behind it is largely flawed, and IMHO (and it is only my opinion, therefore worth very little) unfair to all kingdoms, who should be able to set their own taxes and raise their own funds instead, while contributing to more UK-wide funding needs on different terms).

Anyway, thanks for being so civil about all this.

true,SMTRodent,eng-nottinghamshire,Back in Nottnum,"Take a year out, get a low-level job and do some volunteering on the side. Ignore the A levels - you can do them later if you need to and it's otherwise two whole years out of your life wasted by treading water or doing something you hate. Nobody's going to blink at an 18 yo starting A levels because they've seen the world a bit and made their minds up what they want to do.

The low-level job gets you used to earning your keep and teaches you the value of money - this is a valuable life skill. While you're job hunting, it also teaches you about job hunting, another skill which it's better to learn now rather than post-degree.  You will also get whatever skills you learn on the job, if any.

The voluntary work looks *really good* as and when you choose a life direction, and (IME) is actually quite fun. (I've helped at Riding for the Disabled and can't recommend them enough, but it depends on what voluntary places you can get to. ) The job is more or less to fund the voluntary work. 

At this point,  you get to experience what life *could* be like if you 'failed'. Except, actually you're 16, and have several years ahead to get your shit together and decide what you want to do before it starts looking bad on your CV. A levels you take a year or two late look much better than A levels you fail entirely.

When I was 16, I was so stuck on the school-then-college-then-university track that it didn't even *occur* to me that I might have done myself more good being a trainee junior lab technician straight out of school, or even a supermarket shelf-stacker.

I've mentioned here before that I mentor a young boy as part of an urban youth charity, and the biggest impediment was having to apply and then wait months for a CRB check. I got my training and didn't get assigned the kids for almost a year!

But yes, even when adjusting for white teenagers from single homes, black kids are still disproportionally represented, and like I said, it's the culture they have created. People like to call it ""black"" culture, but it's not a culture the majority of black people share in. These kids think they *have* to act the way they do to even fit in.

One thing that is overlooked, even when you're dealing with absent fathers is the network. People might not like it, but ethnic networks are a very powerful thing. Let me tell you about school. I went to school in Bermondsey, in the 90's. Now as a son of African parents, I almost had no choice in the matter...I was going to university. But when you would ask the young white boys what they would do when they got out of school, almost to a man they would say being a labourer, bricklayer, plumber...regular working class fare. At the time it seemed sad, as if they had settled for always staying in a particular social class. What I didn't know then and I know now is the *safety* in that network. They all left school right at 16 and straight away would end up in their dads, or uncles or older brothers firm...the same way you used to hear about mining or manufacturing communities in the past where the son would go work down the mine with several previous generations or the factory.

Black people have never established that here in the UK, and that's another one of our failings. We strive to be doctors and lawyers and engineers abut in reality there are limited spots for those jobs. If you suggested to a young black kid ""you should pursue a career as a plumber"" their parents would see it as racism, like you're trying to limit them...yet another failing. I don't know how we fix that, because then it keeps us out of creating that working class network of safety the white kids in my school had.",0,1319655677,null,0,false,0,c2uo403,t3_lpt6i,t1_c2uo403,t1_c2unvkz,1427786894,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Why would you give it such a slant unless you wanted to spread the message and practise of your religion? I don't think the government should be evangelising in schools. I certainly didn't learn anything about morality from singing 'he's got the whole world in his hands', anyway.

That, or the 60-IQ people from the larger subreddits are finally starting to discover this one due to the rising popularity of the show in the U.S.  Not to be cruel, but in off-times like this one where no new content is airing, there just aren't enough people visiting to play janitor for the random person that strolls by and goes ""MAN I REALLY LIKED TENNANT.  I SHOULD POST ABOUT IT."" without checking to realize there were 3 of those exact posts the day prior.  The subreddit isn't like this when the show is in season.  I still check it for when there is actual news (like the Elisabeth Sladen autobiography or the news about The Gunpowder Plot).  It's pretty terrible that it's necessary for me to have to sort through 90% of the front page to find the two articles that should actually be here.  That said, I do exercise my right to downvote rather liberally.  It's just that during the off-season time, there's so much trash content that I imagine a lot of people stop downvoting bad submissions since it would be the majority of content present on the front page.

Honestly, I think it would be nice if reddit supported stickies (since people often just ignore the content on the right) so that we could just make a notice to not post a picture of Tennant's/Eccleston's/whoever's face, to not make bad puns or shitty rage comic, and, to be frank, to not post your Tennant/Smith cosplay that really doesn't look any closer to the real thing than any of the other hundred submissions that showed up in the last couple of weeks due to NYCC and Halloween.  There's plenty of posts about these exact things submitted here already.

âNow, where do you live?

[Apple Continues To Insist Only It Can Use An Apple In A Logo; Threatens Small German Cafe](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111022/01124516464/apple-continues-to-insist-only-it-can-use-apple-logo-threatens-small-german-cafe.shtml)

You people go on as if trademarks were frivolous trivialities. They aren't. Companies spend billions on branding, advertising and protecting trademarks around the world. Do you really think companies would spend all this money if it didn't impact them hugely? So why shouldn't a charity protect its trademark in the same aggressive way? Why should it let itself get pushed around just because it's a charity? Maybe it needs to be more aggressive as it depends almost entirely on people's good will and people's positive perceptions of it?

Also, a band and a music charity aren't actually all that different. They're both related to music, so it would be easier for them to be confused in people's minds than Apple computers and Apple records.

true,ermintwang,english,MCR,"Yes, we shouldn't be teaching children to do something because they are scared of some non-existent deity damning them to an eternity in hell if they do it. I think that's wrong. I'm not 'scared' to do something bad because I fear God's wrath - I don't do bad things because I think they are wrong and could harm others. I would rather not have my child taught by their school that they shouldn't do something bad because it is committing a 'sin' and God will send them to hell if they do. I find that idea abhorrent. 

The point is that religion shouldn't be presented to children as a fact, because it simply isn't a fact and imposing one specific world-view on them as part of their formal education isn't legitimate. 

Children should be free to pursue religion as a educational subject at school, they shouldn't be taught ONE religion as the ONLY truth - which is the case at the moment. Islam, Hinduism etc. are presented in schools are religions of the 'other'. Christianity is what we are told is correct because it's the only one we HAVE to take part in at school. I have a moral objection to this. I don't want children to have to take part in any religion, because it's none of the school's business to push anyone into any faith. Requiring them to worship the Christian god in school is pushing them into a certain faith.

I don't have a 'twisted' notion that religion is about worshipping an idol (although I have absolutely no idea where you got that from, as I didn't reference any idols, only the concept of God and Mohammed who is a prophet), I am of the view that religion is about worshipping a god or gods who do not exist - and I don't think children should be doing that in state schools.

If you pick a college, you get to pick somewhere where the odds, or the culture or whatever, are your preference. The goal is to slant the odds in your favour as much as possible. 

On the admissions side, the goal is to admit the most promising students, regardless of where they're interviewed: depending on subject, you might interview at 2 or 3 or more colleges during the interview process. If any of those like you, then each of them will stake a claim: my housemate was apparently wanted by at least one other college to the one he interviewed at (and subsequently went to). On the other hand, even if you interview at only one college, and that college is full, but you're still promising, then they'll try to put you in a space at another college.

I cant remember how often we were taken into the Church next door for mass, maybe every other week.
There was also a convent so a few of the teachers were Irish catholic nuns. Never saw one smile.

On one side I think if you are going to send your kid to a school called ""St.Patrick's Roman Catholic Primary School"" you have to accept that the school probably involves a lot of christianity.

However I also think religion shouldnt play a part in schools at all unless its to educate children that many religions exist, rather than to promote ones own religion.

I was sent to that school simply because it was the closest to home.

&gt;The only reason you are OK with this is because it's what you grew up with and it sounds normal,

I don't have that view but you seemed convinced I did :) That bothered me a little, but it's no problem, lets not dwell on that.



Now, lets address these points you've raised. I understand your concern that children shouldn't be scared of 'some non-existent deity' (I like how convinced you are about that, j/k), but it's just something you tell kids. It's like Santa or something (not a great example, I know) except Santa is just a lie, whereas we know that Mohammed, Buddha etc actually existed. 


On that topic, I assume you don't celebrate Christmas?


Now, what are these facts you are speaking of? I'm curious to know what you are specifically referring too in terms of religious teaching. I was never presented anything as 'fact' and I'd be annoyed if someone tried to say: ""Jesus walked on water! FACT!"" but that has never happened. It sounds like you had a very different experience of religion in school.

I think I know what you mean, but it is impractical to preface every statement with 'ok, this is just an idea but- maybe you shouldn't steal'.
Imagine how long science classes would take if we said 'ok, now we have this theory about mass, we don't know how or why it works but this is our rough understanding', I never got taught that way even though I think it should have been presented like that. You leave school thinking all these laws are set in stone when they are all just theories and observations. Why should I be taught about scientific theories as fact?


I pointed out Hinduism and Buddhism specifically as there isn't a 'single truth' involved, which appeals to me. Do you know much about them? You might be pleasantly surprised.


I really like your idea about kids getting the choice of religion, I just don't think it's that practical. I'd rather money was spent on other areas of education rather than getting a cleric  of every major religion in each school. Why not just have a referendum say, every 10 or 20 years to see what the nation would like as their national religion?

In my own experience I learnt about religion in school, Christianity specifically, Never paid much attention and shunned it as 'fairy stories', but I know the moral ideas are somewhere in my sub-conscience. Now I'm older and have life experience and I know religion isn't that simple. I'm glad I had that base to build from to explore other faiths (purely as a an experience, I have no interest in 'converting' or being a formal religion follower).

The most obvious when it comes to children is the plagues of Egypt, which is pretty bloody from start to finish with little real justification other than one group (the 'chosen people') are inherently superior.  Follow that up with Noah's ark where eradication of the human race is acceptable if you don't like the way people behave and they don't worship you enough.  Sure it's a massive stretch to suggest that by doing that we'll raise the next Hitler, but I don't consider them moral stories.

Even the good Samaritan is bizarre if you think about it.  It assumes that it's not abnormal to think of certain groups of people as inherently evil/self-centred/... then says wow here's one who's nice.  The overall would be much more effective if it was more about the victim being the one who changes his mind and accepts his mistake, but whenever I've heard it his original position has been more the norm.  Relating to the previous paragraph we need to deliver morals which individuals can relate to themselves and to the world around them today.  My suggestion would be that there are plenty of everyday experience type stories which convey the good parts of this story, but in a way which is more relevant to the children to which it is being delivered and more likely to be taken to heart.

In short - if you want to preach the *good* parts of the bible, consider if they would be more effective at instilling morals if delivered as a story in a modern setting than a setting which pupils have no connection to from thousands of years ago.

You are correct that those who gather on Reddit (and comment and get upvoted enough to be seen) are those with a decent education and background; it's self selecting.  Most of us did, however, attend state schools where we mixed with others from disadvantaged backgrounds, and likely would have been much happier if said children we more moral and good natured.  The thing is, we don't agree that religion is the way to achieve this, and we object to being told (by unelected bishops in the House of Lords no less) that:

&gt; We do not want to marginalise worship or spirituality within the life of our schools

Because actually, I do.  My mother teaches at a CoE school and doing so has turned her into something approaching a militant atheist, so it's not just my perspective looking back over the years to my childhood, I really do feel, and many here agree, that this approach is not appropriate firstly in this day and secondly with our current cultural make-up.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; Where else can they learn these morals? What are these secular morality teaching methods, by the way?

Stories in general often teach morals. Aesop's fables, fairy stories or even consider Harry Potter in the last decade or so. Religious teaching i.e. ""This particular god says do this therefore do it or suffer the consequences"" is an awful way of teaching right from wrong - that's what the Abrahamic religions (generally) amount to. This problem of collective worship is not about the teaching of morals but rather it is about teaching a *religion*. Never mind the bible stories or how kids will get morals, the change to the law was regarding 'collective worship'. To get a bit technical: ""Show reverence and adoration for (a deity); honor with religious rites."" If we do away with collective worship then you can get stories with morals from anywhere, including Christianity, just like you could before. But there will be no law saying ""The School will be required to sing hymns and have prayers or have sermons of a primarily Christian nature (or at all).""

Many secularists in the UK, including myself, are of the opinion that philosophy, taught from primary school age, is a far better way of instilling morals and ethics in young people than telling them what religion to believe in.

With regards you (and all of us) knowing ""scumbags with no morals"", well that's another matter entirely, but we should not be catering for the fuckwits: Just because someone hasn't been brought up knowing not to shove a brick through a window because they're bored doesn't mean that *every single* child attending a state school should be *forced* to devote some time to a religion and a deity they that are likely to not even comprehend.

true,ermintwang,english,MCR,"OK - you have got those terms mixed up. Jesus and Mohammed aren't idols, and referring to them as such would be considered offensive by members of those religions. An idol is a physical, material object which is supposed to represent a deity and worshipping them is a sin in Christianity and Islam. 

I was told in school that Jesus was the messiah, and the son of God. That is presenting it as a truth :/ Saying in a school assembly - 'Jesus walked on water' is the same whether you put a fatuous 'FACT' on the end or not.  When I was taught about Islam in school, I was told 'Muslims believe..', or 'In Islamic culture this is the belief'. Christianity was presented very differently in religious assemblies. It wasn't a lesson where we were welcomed to discuss and think about other cultures and religious beliefs, we were told to pray to Jesus and that was that. That is what I have a problem with - religious worship as obligatory, and Christianity as the default. 

Having a referendum every ten years to change the national religion would be far more costly, less practical, and more complicated than having clerics visit schools to discuss religion. Are you taking the piss with that paragraph? Do you really think it would be easier to have a referendum every 10 years and change the country's religion, compared to having clerics visit schools? Seriously? 

And YES - scientific theories are provable, testable, verifiable - that is why we can teach them as fact. GCSE and A-Level science isn't some theoretical, abstract stuff that needs those kinds of qualifiers. We can teach evolution, gravity, states of materials as facts. Let me get this straight though - so you DO want scientific theory taught as fact, but you DON'T want Christianity taught as mythology?

I appreciate what you say and agree that a defence solicitor is needed to help people who do not know their rights and need someone who understands what they are facing.

Unfortunately I have personal experience from a friend who was arrested and says that his solicitor helped him create a story to justify what happened. Admittedly this is one anecdote from a friend but it still sticks in my mind. Like the police I guess you get bad apples everywhere.

I think the issue I have is that I don't see my job as done correctly unless the bad guys get what they deserve and I see defence solicitors working to stop me doing that. I agree the police (don't get me started on the CPS!) need to do more sometimes to get the evidence needed.

Just to quickly cover your points:

Sorry I said, idol. I can't imagine there is anyone else here who will get offended though! :)

I was taught in more or less the same way, we both ended up atheist/agnostic. What does that tell you? To me it says, getting taught religion in school doesn't really matter at the end of the day. At least its a bit of culture.


I help organise referendums so I know it's not the best idea, I was just brainstorming ideas. No need to get wound up about it. You could have just said, ""why not just check the census forms and see what people want?"".


Scientific theories are exactly what the title suggests, that's what makes them *theories*. There are plenty of scientific *facts*, yes, but the difference was never taught to me (looks like you aren't too sure either, everything you said there was contradictory!). To me, the concept of gravity seems just as bizarre as the concept of karma and we are no closer to understanding what 'mass' is as we are the conscious mind.


To get that bit straight, I want science taught exactly how it is now and I think religion should be phased out when someone has a better idea. Right now I think religion should be encouraged due to the state of society in general- I believe it has the power to improve communities whereas atheism is hollow at its core.

http://imgur.com/a/JzQLd

I doubt you'll be able to get light proof paper, but most any black paper will do (I just like this kind because it's shiny and durable)

What you do is cut out a piece of cardboard from the corner of a kleenex box that measures 5.5 in width and 5 in height, with 2.5 inches on either side of the fold. Glue a piece of the black paper to the inside of the cardboard, make sure there is a bit hanging over the edge that you can glue down on the outside so that later no cardboard will show (note that my glue was ineffectual, so i had to tape the lip down, you may or may not have to do the same). After all that is taken care of, cut a piece of plastic from the ziploc. It should measure about 6 by 2.75 inches set it up so that there is a .25 lip on the top and the sides of the cardboard. To attach this, glue/tape the lip on the outside ONLY, do not glue the inside. Finally cut a piece of paper the exact same size of the cardboard and glue it to the back of the paperholder. THERE SHOULD BE NO LIP.

*protip: if you have tacking paper and a press for mounting photographs, use that instead of gluing the paper on, I found it provides a much nicer flat texture.

Once you are done, just slide a piece of paper into the pocket made by the ziplock plastic, and you are done.

true,sammyslug,cnty-england,Police Officer AMA!,"I see your point, especially regarding ""fuck this, taser him, job done"" and, in all honesty, this is already an issue due to human nature.

Naturally some people have more patience than others and will be willing to put up with more before reacting. For example you watch any cop show on UK streets and you'll see some officers sworn at time and time again and just continue warning and others will get sworn at twice and nick the person. Who is right in this situation? It's difficult because the offence has been committed but should you give more chances?

The same applies with force. Every incident is unique and must be judged on it's merits and, at the end of the day, we are accountable to the law as much as anyone else (despite what you read sometimes!) and can lose our job and end up in prison if we use too much force. Whilst attitudes in the police may change towards complacency with taser usage I'm sure the courts won't be so quick to change (they never are!).

Pain compliance, however, is a taught method of getting people to do ""something"". As an example we have in training is someone sitting in the middle of the road refusing to move. They are not directly a threat however they are committing an offence (obstruction of the highway) and must be moved. At the moment we are taught various things from pulling them around, to pressure point control and other unarmed tactics. Do I think one day we would taser someone in this situation? Honestly, no. We don't (or shouldn't IMO) currently CS or asp them and taser is considered to be the same scale as CS.

I'd have a much greater objection to my children being taught Harry Potter to gain their moral fibre than an established religious text. At least the religious texts have every aspect of immorality and morality covered (as far as I am aware nearly all religions teach the same basic messages, but they have every base covered). If someone can build up something similar for a secular society I'll be one of the first supporting it! So far all you've done is prove my point that the secular society doesn't have anything that can cover everything religions can... I'm not saying this can't be changed, we just aren't there yet.


Like you say, philosophy and logic lessons would be a good start. But then again morality isn't all that religion offers. If something extreme happens, it's good to have a faith to fall back on when nothing else seems to matter. To reiterate, I'm not a religious person, but it's nice to know there is a crutch there if I need it.

 I've bought a few of these even though I don't even own a record player for the exact reasons the author of the article still wants to have books.

I take your point about balance of power, and obviously your experience is a good reinforcement of that. I suppose my attitude is if a company wants to do something like outsourcing they're going to find a way, and trying to prevent them through these sort of restrictions is looking at it through the wrong end of the telescope. I'd rather we gave people a soft landing, and spent more money on finding them employment, or retraining them if the jobs aren't available. 

Also, the areas in which employers have a lot of power are rather skewed, because they can really damage your career by giving a bad reference, but only after you've moved elsewhere. So they have a lot of power if you're moving from one job to another, but very little if you stay in the same place.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; Can you hear yourself saying this! Are these any better than the stories in the bible? 

You're missing my point entirely and I have to wonder if it was on purpose, considering how you focussed on Harry Potter. You said ""Where can people get morals if not religion?"" and I gave you a couple of simple examples of stories with moral messages. But you think I'm being rather silly... 

&gt; they don't cover as much of life

So you'd say that you find the stories of the bible absolutely 100% applicable to pretty much every situation you have had or will ever come across in your life? If you say no then I would argue that therefore you'll find other stories elsewhere that could help you get through other difficulties. What might those stories be?

&gt; At least the religious texts have every aspect of immorality and morality covered

Do they really? So we could look to the pages of the bible for explicit information regarding abortion and to make it especially easy we can consider the issue of ectopic pregnancy. I'll even extend it to the Torah and the Quran - Do any of those three texts give us a story that deal with whether or not a medical practitioner should intervene to save the life of a (potential) mother who is carrying an unviable fetus that will kill both of them if it continues to grow? I hope you understand my point here, so I'll give you the reason as to why it won't be explicitly in the bible etc.: The pregnant women died but no-one knew why.

&gt; So far all you've done is prove my point that the secular society doesn't have anything that can cover everything religions can... I'm not saying this can't be changed, we just aren't there yet.

I proved it doesn't? There was me thinking exactly the opposite. Well I didn't give you a shed load of detailed examples which I have to say I now get the impression would have been the only thing that would have satisfied you. And you appear to think that only religion (Christianity) is holding everything together? Personally I think not: Bearing in mind how many people are commenting here on how there is very little singing and praying in schools or assemblies in their experience, then extend that nationally. OK this thread is actually about the praying etc. in schools, not bible stories being read out to teach kids morals etc. BUT very few people are having these stories told to them in the assemblies in the form of a sermon and what not. Just read this thread for numerous examples!

So where did *I* get my morality from? I was brought up in a secular household and *very* rarely attended church for anything. No Sunday school and because I was in a school of children from Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh etc. families, I can assure we my school didn't focus on any one particular religion or even cycle through all of them. But (excuse me while I blow my own trumpet) from a very early age I displayed empathy, sympathy, morals and ethics (as much as a child can) but I also was of the opinion from a *very* young age that ALL religion's underlying god stuff was rubbish. I saw it as elaborately developed ways of describing how 'we' came to be about, before people had the tools to properly understand. So where did I get my morality from to lead me to be the upstanding, law abiding member of society?

&gt; But then again morality isn't all that religion offers. 

No it also offers absolutely no proof of any of its supernatural claims - but that's another discussion entirely.

&gt; If something extreme happens, it's good to have a faith to fall back on when nothing else seems to matter. To reiterate, I'm not a religious person, but it's nice to know there is a crutch there if I need it.

It's hard to begin rebutting this...there's so much to answer! Just because religion is ""nice when everything is screwed"" is not a decent argument to teach it to children in school. In any case you're totally ignoring people like me: I don't have a religion or a belief in a deity - are you one of the people who draw a distinction between the two, by the way? - so what do you think that I would do/do do when it all goes belly up? You must acknowledge how many people there are in the world who don't revert to a 'happy place' filled with Jesus when their family all die or there's an earthquake. The number of non-religious people in the world is huge. Even in the 'Christian' UK it could be more than three quarters who are not religious: You have to ignore the cultural Christians, [details here](http://www.humanism.org.uk/campaigns/religion-and-belief-surveys-statistics).

&gt; On the last point, you've been a bit hypocritical, haven't you?

No, I don't think so.

&gt; but abandoning people like that is the last thing I want

Abandoning people? Wait, what - who said anything about that? It's not ""one thing or the other"". How much influence do you think religion/indoctrination *has* in most schools? One of the major reasons that collective worship can be challenged in schools is because it is unenforceable and hardly anyone does it *anyway*! Morality is filtering to children in other and better ways than them all sitting down and learning about what Jesus is said to have said. I shall use... ME! as an example.

&gt; In my opinion morality is the most important thing you learn

By the by: [You know a some of it is innate?](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/magazine/09babies-t.html?pagewanted=all) 

So to underline my main point from this rather long comment: Morality is not only given in short religious bursts in assemblies. Even if it once was, it hasn't been for decades. If you think, as you have implied, that religion is the only and best moral compass available then you're very wrong. Not only that but you would be ignoring the bucket loads of 'bad' morality that religious texts always drag along with them. I would ask you to consider how one filters out the good from the bad, if not by some external-to-religion moral guidance. And try not to focus too hard on Harry Potter.

I think people get annoyed by *some* 10 fans because they won't stop being pushy and loud and obnoxious. You can make the argument that the people who object to these posts are just as annoying, but if what they're doing culls down posts like these, it's a service.

Anyway I do a joint Creative Writing + MCS. I have found that a lot of the time it comes down to you. They are there to guide you slightly and produce some sort of theory although with creative writing there isn't much weight on that. It is a lot more artsy and requires you individually to be innovative. Imo you could probably teach most of the stuff yourself but you don't get the professional feedback which is critical and hopefully like my uni yours has events where writers go down to do talks which are free for students? I do agree somewhat that you probably aren't getting the amount back you paid for I feel the same in some ways. I don't have that many contact hours but am given quite a lot of personal work to do, but those contact hours are rather intense.

In my case I have been living in a small village all of my life and there is one female my age who lives there not counting family members. So I'm glad to be out here and indeed it sounds stupid but this experience is one way of going about things. If I were to go straight into working I probably wouldn't know such a large group of diverse people. In my house alone we have a geog student, 2 business students, 1 physics student a music student and a computer science student.

As a joint student in the social science dp to I can see how you might feel with regards to the way things are done in CW because it is more focused and structured. Like there are deffinate topics to cover and the lecturers are already specialised in a certain topic so you know who to go to. Such as my cyberculture lecturer has a book published in cyberbullying and other cybercrime. So I know that I would need to talk to her if I needed material. Simialarly I did a paper on the arab spring and the effects of social media and I went to the lecturer who had published material on the social and political side of the internet. Though in CW most of the lecturers here seem to do both none fiction and fiction and don't really stick to any certain genre but probably wouldn't give too much advise on that anyway.

Luckily my lecturers have been a good bunch who are great at getting information across, they joke and go off on funny tangents occasionally, which I suppose may seem unprofessional but it's great for our concentration. Of course we also have a few bad lecturers but you kind of just have to soldier on through and just try to stay awake.

Some modules do seem like a waste of time but I don't think anyone could possibly enjoy every module, so again I just try to get on with it. Depending on our exact course we may not even get a choice in any year. Second year modules seemed fairly different from the first year, although they did cover some things again, personally I was grateful for the refresh on some topics. 

I can't think of anything I would really complain about.. perhaps that I'm doing a BSc but there is very little science actually involved. I feel it would but useful to know some physics and chemistry, especially now. I'm studying at a foreign university for a year, their teaching is pretty terrible and I have no guidance on coursework or exams, but at least I'm learning the physics behind crustal movements and stuff like that.

Man. The bow tie thing is a real double edged sword. Not how often people say it but what it means. On one hand it's assertive, on the other, it's basically closing your ears to dissent by just loudly insisting your standpoint is right. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but that's the impression I'm getting.

I didn't say they were. My point is that the upvote/downvote ratio doesn't make a good ""who's right"" argument.

&gt;Telling them to go play somewhere else is shameful behavior for anyone who enjoys a show about an alien pacifist. 

Not really. I want to see new things, I want to read interesting conversations or participate in them. And ""I really miss Tennant"" is a tired, *tired* old post. It's not just on Reddit. It's everywhere. And maybe this will help ease that particular tsunami of posts.

&gt;As for protesting their opinion-- they relinquished the right to remain unmolested when they infringed on other people's rights to express an opinion.

Created in Europe, but mythologically Asian in origin.

The Toymaker's toys are all Victorian dolls and such. And to quote an article, ""So this is a nefarious, evil Chinese man who twists good Victorian children's culture into sadistic and evil games.""

He got a little overated at the back end of last season and over the summer, which is why Bolton felt they could demand such big money for a player who wanted to leave.

We've been unlucky with injuries so far, but we're only talking about a couple of matches where we're down to just Kaboul and Bassong, not half the season. Also bear in mind Corluka is a decent enough centre back who is also currently injured. Same goes for Huddlestone.

Don't be so down on Bassong - he's not perfect, but he is good and still young.

I guess what I'm saying is that while these are all viable options when an injury crisis occurs, we should have more adequately prepared.

Edit: Also, about your point about the availability of Cahill next summer and not resorting to Man City Madness, I hardly think spending a net 10 million or so after selling Bassong to get a highly rated 25  year old centerback comes anywhere close to ridiculous. Also, there will be many suitors next summer with MUCH higher contract money available, making signing him out of contract that much more difficult.

The only person putting any effort in is Lalla Ward, and most of the time she gets regulated to being 'Generic Female Companion #445'.

true,HungryBook,cnty-uk,Insaniquarium,"You've probably just complained, rather than following the University's process for registering complaints.  They put these hoops in the way to weed out moaners from legitimate complaints.

Have a look on your Uni's website\intranet site, or go to the Student Union's 'welfare and advice' centre on site, and ask them how you register a written, formal complaint with the university.  (For example, this is the one for Wolves Uni - I found it by googling 'formal complain wolverhampton uni', since I couldn't see it on their site.)

It lists the requirements, directions, and stages for the complaints process.  

You have several good points about what is wrong with the course; you also need to suggest resolution so they are FIXED.  And yeah, since you're on the last year of the course, it won't help you, but it will help others.  You may ask for a reduction in your overall course fee (come up with what you think is a sensible percent; 10-25% usually would be sensible, especially if you have made several 'limited' complaints about individual staff.)  Point out that you have complained previously (explain how) just to let it sink in, and suggest you were wanting it done informally, rather than this formal step.  

Also, ask for a full response, detailing what\how the University intends to fix it.

Keep it polite, offer to meet the dean\principal personally to explain situations, etc.

Hopefully, that'll actually GET a proper response rather than the ignores.",0,1319697162,null,0,false,0,c2utz7c,t3_lq9nl,t1_c2utz7c,t3_lq9nl,1427789725,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

From a comment posted elsewhere, taken from [here](http://www.emedicinehealth.com/alcohol_intoxication/page2_em.htm).


&gt;400 mg/dL: Comatose, not able to be aroused, incontinent (wets self), low blood pressure, irregular breathing
500 mg/dL: Death possible, either from cessation of breathing, excessively low blood pressure, or vomit entering the lungs without the presence of the protective reflex to cough it out

That's certainly not the goal.  From time to time, however, things like this need to be said.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"Interesting aside;

I've been trying to find figures for poverty in the UK. Best I could find was 21.8% living below the median income. I would like to see the figures for what percentage of the prison pop. comes from this 21.8%, and then I would like to see the ethnic background of this 21.8% and compare that to the breakdown of the prison pop. I think that would be more indicative of any dispoprtionate representation of any minority.

In regards to the story as we have it, 1st off it's not 40% young black men, but all ethnic minorities. Does this include the irish do you think Or did they stop being considered a minority? Poor populations always gravitate towards the black market. It's an easy way to make money without having a good education and important contacts. Therefore it is also not uncommon for immigrants to fall into this black economy as they too will usually be in a similar situation, by default, as the indigenous poor.

I think father figure is an issue obviously, but I do think this is changing. It's becoming more and more common in urban black culture to take care of and be proud of your children.

There is an anti-academia attitude among the yoof, and this is more of a problem in some ""cultures"", but I do also think this is changing.

However, I was watching a documentary called ""Crack House"" the other day on Channel 4 (Absolutely fascinating btw, You should watch in on 4OD. Cops put hidden cameras in a crack house for 6 months). What struck me was that some of these hardened criminals, responsible for a lot of gun crime, were actually just normal people. On the surface it was really hard to tell they were callous bastards. But the main attraction to this life of crime seemed to be, that if you don't have contacts and the encouragement and belief in yourself that you can make the education system work for you and become a law abiding success, then selling crack and a life of crime is an incredibly easy, accessible and realistic way of making a good living for yourself.

I'd never really considered it like that before, but I it hit me the other day. Even as a well off white kid from the fringes of East London, I dabbled in a couple of enterprises shall we say. And it was very, very easy, very hard to resist and was very profitable.

One key issue in my eyes, is that the black economy is much more accessible for a lot of kids from certain socio-economic backgrounds, and with the rampant consumer culture that we have, combined with the economic problems, even harder than ever to resist. 
A couple of things we could do to change this in my eyes, would be to legalise and regulate drugs, so as to make the black economy less profitable and thus less tempting for these young men. And improve the education system. I have not much clue on this second point, but I would definitely like to see a more vocational approach.",0,1319705382,null,0,false,0,c2uukp3,t3_lpt6i,t1_c2uukp3,t3_lpt6i,1427790010,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"Your point is fair on the injury situation, it was somewhat forseeable, but you just can't fill a squad at our level entirely with top quality players, especially with no CL football. It'd be great if we had Cahill now, but when everyone is fit, then you have players pissed off at having to sit out - Kaboul is coming along very nicely, certainly don't want him losing out on opportunities.

You seem to be placing us on a level playing field with the big boys of the league, but as much as we want to be up there we're not quite there yet. 

I also don't see that replacing Bassong was ever a good solution and I'm glad it didn't happen. Our big problem is an inability to consistently field the same centre backs, and that's nothing to do with Bassong. He's a very decent player, also only 25, and with a good amount of top flight experience behind him - we'd struggle to find a better prospect to replace Gallas or King, both almost certain to be into their penultimate season for us at best.

King, Gallas and Dawson are the problems. You can accomodate a player who maybe won't be fit as often as you'd like if they add real quality to the squad; you can maybe accomodate two in the same position if you consider them as alternates; but trying to work with three players in that position is just stupid.

Obviously King stays for as long as his knee can hold him upright, so it shoud really be Gallas or Dawson going. I don't like Dawson so I would plump for him, despite Gallas' age (you know we gave him a 2 year contract in May? Strange decision I think...). I think Dawson is overrated enough that there are PL teams who would fight over spending 10m on him - we need to cash in before he plays any more and the penny drops, so get him out, get Cahill in and I'm more than happy.

You're right about the competition being fierce for Cahill down the line, but though it's tough to call it, I think waiting for a bit was probably more sensible than paying through the nose on deadline day - we keep this form up and we'll have a very tempting proposition for him come January. If we can get him for 6-7m then we'll have made the right decision - same if we get him free in the summer. Fingers-crossed, because as has been pointed out there aren't many other good options out there at the moment, and we have players who need to be replaced.

Though let's not forget forget Caulker will be back with a year's experience next summer - that kid's gonna be a monster, he was playing fantastically for Swansea before his injury and he should be back in less than  month. We start the 2012/13 season with King, Cahill, Kaboul, Bassong and Caulker as centre back options and I will be a very happy man. If Gallas plays on for one more season and Caulker or Bassong goes on loan for another year of consistent top flight experience I'll be even happier.

ps. I think Mr. Levy might have something to say about you dismissing the 5m loss we'd be making on Bassong if we had let him go for 5m - we paid Newcastle 10m for him only just over two years back. I think paying double what Cahill's contract was worth and selling Bassong for half his value at the same time might just have killed Levy, so probably for the best.",0,1319711356,null,0,false,0,c2uuvh5,t3_lql2m,t1_c2uuvh5,t1_c2utdyx,1427790147,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

These were not strictly economic standpoints, and they still can't be strictly defined as such.

As I said, I think it's fine to use those basic definitions for a basic overview of British politics, which does not have any totalitarianism to deal with. If I was giving an overview of North Korean politics I wouldn't use a single-axis spectrum because it would have been inadequate.

You'll notice I made no mention of them (because I don't think they're particularly relevant) but I'm fully aware of the BNP's politics. I don't care about them enough to view them passionately. You're wrong to call them an authoritarian party, they're actually very big on social freedoms. Isolationism and nationalism are not authoritarian policies.

You will have to pay the tax in two chunks each year.

Your other option is illegal tax evasion.  If you don't think you will get caught by R&amp;C then don't tell them.  Produce vague invoice detail (i.e. name, address, contact).  Ask for cash payment or personal cheque - obviously cheques will leave a record if they do catch up to you but I imagine architecture is one of the fields where cash might not be an option.

true,tvlb1,uk,United Kingdom,"Yep, it's a issue I feel passionately about. TV Licensing (the BBC) persecute legitimate non-TV viewers in their homes. They threaten them with imaginary legislation and intrusive visits to confirm their innocence. One of the founding tenets of the British justice system is that people shouldn't have to prove a negative, yet TV Licensing happily ignore that point. They're only worried about making sales, because each of their employees is on commission for selling licences by whatever means.

Anyone who legitimately doesn't have a TV has no business with TV Licensing and should not be harassed by them. You don't get pestered by the DVLA if you don't have a driving licence. They don't threaten to search your home for a car either. 

Unfortunately TV Licensing's mentality is such that they can't distinguish between TV licence dodger and genuine non-TV user. Even if you tell them you're a non-TV viewer, not that you're legally obliged to tell them anything, they'll still disbelieve you. 

They're happy to terrorise the law abiding majority in the hope a few licence dodgers might be scared into paying up.",0,1319720228,null,0,true,0,c2uvfv6,t3_lquk3,t1_c2uvfv6,t1_c2uvas0,1428185492,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

House of Lords doesn't actually have that much power anyway. House of Commons can over rule anything they say or do. I'm not that against it personally, it's generally made up of people who are 'the best in their field', which is who I want advising/running the country. But obviously there is some scandal... it is political after all! I'd sooner see the Conservatives kicked out the Commons than the Lords sent packing.

The structured nature actually doesn't really bother me overtly. But, as I said up top, a lot of our contact hours are wasted. We spend decidedly too much time free-writing, and that is a pure waste of a lecturer. As I've pointed out numerous times, I can write at home, but I don't have a lecturer there.

Space. They throw up as many houses as they possibly can in whatever space they can find. I found this in a lot of the new estates that have recently been built. They've been terraced houses that are packed in and then flogged off or available to rent - lines of houses for ~120 each.

Architecture costs are minimised because the houses are literally the same inside.

&gt;on whether the proposed building meets national guidelines

Yeah, guidelines about targets set. Councils can't just build 3-4 bed semis in one area, because there isn't enough space and because there needs to be some affordable housing available for the first time buyer (or council houses).

Time travelling neutrinos: weeeell...First I'm in physics academia but this is not my field. Second of all you have to remember that the media is the media and is always after a story. When it comes to science reporting the mainstream media is a bit crap. Also bear in mind that the scientists that 'found' the discrepancy said ""Look, we've got these results we can't explain. This doesn't fit with everything we know. Can anyone repeat our results and/or explain them?"" They weren't saying: ""Definitive evidence that neutrinos travel faster than light! Everything we know is wrong!"" which is the line that papers generally go with because it gives them a nice headline.

A good response to the neutrino story is the case of the [supernova from 1987](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1987A#Neutrino_emissions). When the results were announced from CERN, people went to this supernova data and said ""Right, if neutrinos are moving faster than light by X% [as given by the OPERA data] then we should have seen the neutrinos a certain amount of time before the light."" With the supernova being so far away, the neutrinos should have arrived at earth *years* before the light. As it happens they got here only 3 hours before, and that's explainable. So it would seem that most likely there's a problem with the experiment, maybe a systematic error, that explains the discrepancy.

I'm not saying ""Pish! It's all rubbish!"" but rather I'm being a skeptic, as everyone should be when presented with something so far out of the ordinary. All credit to the scientists involved - opening up their data etc. for scrutiny is exactly how science should work. If the data is right and the neutrinos *are* moving faster than light, then it is a wonderful example of how science works: changing models and ideas when new data presents itself.

Either way science works, bitches.",0,1319731834,null,0,false,0,c2uwyk9,t3_lq9nl,t1_c2uwyk9,t1_c2uwcq7,1427791137,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

But that university scores shockingly bad in league tables. In [this table](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings/?) it's the worst in the country. In that regard, the complaints you mention really aren't surprising. I'm not saying that excuses the university's behaviour, but I am saying you should have known what to expect. Or not, I know it's difficult when you're 17 or 18 to judge things like this. You may well have been better off with something like an apprenticeship. Of course there's nothing stopping you doing one after university.

I ended up using Minwax Polyacrylic in semi-gloss. Here is a pic of how it turned out:

http://i.imgur.com/NByf4.jpg

 It is the kind you paint on with a brush. It works great in that my scarecrow has been rained on several times and it was not damaged. One thing I did learn is don't panic if it gets wet and feels soggy. It will re-harden once it dries! I flipped out when I woke up to find it pouring outside and when I brought it in, it literally ""squished"" in my hands but did not loose it shape. It was completely fine the next day:)

 Because my prop goes outside, I had to use a lot of sealant but you may not have to since yours is a mask.  I read on a forum that you can dust it with powder to dull it or go back over it and dry brush a little more acrylic paint over the sealant. I may try that with mine.

Incidentally the vast majority of peers were appointed by one party or another, and I think that the treatment of David Nut shows that politicians definition of the best roughly translates as 'agrees with me'.

I think your statement summed up the problem with the Lords; reform has always been worth getting into - another time. The Labour Government committed itself to a fully elected chamber as soon as time allowed for it in... 2010? 1950? nope. 1910.

Anyway I don't blame you but a thread bitching about a lords decision should point out that these people have no mandate.

With regards to you official state religion question. I don't think we should have a state religion. I'm not opposed to religion by any stretch of the imagination, but an official state religion gives adherents to that religion more influence than nonadherents.

Again, on the state religion part. We shouldn't have a 'state religion', especially as we are such a diverse society now. Fact is, at the moment, we do... and as such, we need to work around or work with this system to improve it. It's all well and good saying another system would be better but our government doesn't work like that (unfortunately, I'd like changes to be rapid and fair, but that's just not how it works).

true,harrythebau5,tardis,TARDIS,"Alright, fair enough. My answer is this; a teenager playing The Doctor wouldn't work for me. I think certainly since the series was revived in 2005, if not even further back into the classic series, the actors that have been chosen to portray the Doctor, I'm thinking especially of Tennant and Smith here, clearly aren't 906 years old. But what they are, is old enough and talented enough to comfortably convince viewers of wisdom beyond their years. We believe they're this 906 (roughly) year old character.

No child or teenage actor could ever have the same effect on me as Tennant or Smith, it's as simple as that. When Matt Smith first started I doubted his range of emotions and his age acted as a barrier to being able to believe in The Doctor as a character, but fair play to him, because in the intervening episodes and series he's won me round.

Personally I've always had serious trouble connecting with teenage actors. I think I could easily count on one hand, all the convincing lead performances by teenage actors that I've ever been exposed to in 21 years of watching films and television. Simply, there's no getting round it, life experience effects the ability of an actor to portray a great range of emotions and a teenager just couldn't convincingly play a 900 year old time travelling alien.

true,Irongate,uk,"Walthamstow, London","Ah, the truly sad fact is that, when I applied, the university was acknowledged as having one of the better Creative Writing degrees in the country. I didn't go in blind, not as such. I had no idea about the league table position when I applied, no, but I knew two people who were in their third year of the degree at the time and had nothing but praise for the course. And I got to know the course director and head of faculty very well during my application. I think I've said elsewhere here, but it seemed idyllic. Absolutely idyllic and just what I wanted to do.

But it really did just fall apart - one big administrative shake-up at the university and a number of key staff walking out during the summer immediately before I enrolled. I mean, well and truly, I almost consider myself a victim of simple old bad luck.

I would say though that despite the bad experiences that I've had, I really can't believe that it is the *single* worst university in the United Kingdom. I had heard that statistic/fact a while ago, and I really had to wonder how they came to that conclusion. Especially as there is a countering statistic that says LSBU's graduates have the second highest starting salaries of all London university graduates, just after the London School of Economics. Go figure.

Edit: a couple of commas.

Edit 2: having had a look at that league table it looks like entry requirements are the basis for a lot of that ranking; we seem actually to have higher student satisfaction, research blah blah and graduate prospects than a few other London universities - seems a bit elitist actually that entry requirements count for so much.

Bristol is a pretty fun place, although right now we have a hundred whining college students (some of which are international, as I so dumbfoundedly learned recently) sitting around downtown in tents complaining that they don't have jobs when they aren't looking for jobs and they aren't even graduates yet.  I don't understand your generation.  Call me old if you like.

The University is alright from what I understand.  It is very highly rated.  It is *very* difficult to enter, and these days with the rising xenophobia and concerns about subsidizing international students, it might nearly impossible to enter the school if you aren't an absolutely top student.

Most of the kids from Bristol who want to attend uni have to leave the city, which is a source of tension and I have personally heard people run down international students for taking spots, but who knows how they'll react to you.

Bristol is all about the river.  The roads, the restaurants, the pubs, the venues - everything is laid out along the river.
